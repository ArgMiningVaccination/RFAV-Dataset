Project Overview Project Goals This Community Health Needs Assessment, a follow -up to similar stud ies conducted in 2002 (Douglas County only), 2008 (Douglas, Sarpy, Cass counties only), 2011 and 2015 , is a systematic, data -driven approach to determining the health status, behaviors and needs of residents in the Omaha metropolitan area (including Douglas, Sarpy, Cass, and Pottawattamie counties) . Subsequently, this information may be used to inform decisions and guide efforts to improve community health a nd wellness . A Community Health Needs Assessment provides information so that communities may identify issues of greatest concern and decide to commit resources to those areas, thereby making the g reatest possible impact on community health status . This C ommunity Health Needs Assessment will serve as a tool toward reaching three basic goals: To improve residents' health status, increase their life spans, and elevate their overall quality of life . A healthy community is not only one where its residents suf fer little from physical and mental illness, but also one where its residents enjoy a high quality of life. To reduce the health disparities among residents . By gathering demographic information a long with health status and behavior data, it will be possi ble to identify population segments that are most at -risk for various diseases and injuries . Intervention plans aimed at targeting these individuals may then be developed to combat some of the s ocio-economic factors that historically have had a negative impact on residents' health . To increase accessibility to preventive services for all community residents . More accessible preventive services will prove beneficial in accomplishing the first goal ( improving health status, increasing life spans, and elevati ng the quality of life), as well as lowering the costs associated with caring for late -stage diseases resulting from a lack of preventive care. This assessment was sponsored by a coalition compris ed of local health systems and health departments. Sponsors include: CHI Health (CHI Health Creighton University Medical Center - Bergan Mercy, CHI Health Immanuel, CHI Health Lakeside, CHI Health Mercy Council Bluffs, and CHI Health Midlands) ; Douglas Cou nty Health Department ; Methodist Health System (Methodist H ospital, Methodist Jennie Edmundson Hospital, and Methodist Women's Hospital); Nebraska Medicine (Nebraska Medicine -Nebraska Medical Center and Nebraska Medicine-Bellevue) . Supporting organizations include Charles Drew Health Center , Inc. ; Live Well Omaha; Omaha Community Foundation; One World Community Health Centers, Inc.; Pottawattamie County Public Health Department/VNA; Sarpy/Cass County Health Department; and United Way of the Midlands. COMMUNITY HEA LTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 9 This a ssessment was conducted by Professional Research Consultant s, Inc. (PRC) . PRC is a national ly recognized healthcare consulting firm with extensive experience conducting Community Health Needs Assessments in hundreds of communities across the United States since 1994. Approach The process for this assessment follows an approach as outlined in the Community Health Assessment Toolkit developed by the Association for Community Health Improvement (ACHI). In the ACHI model (at right), Collaborating organizations worked through the first three steps in this process, a nd this assessment document and sub sequent communication activities will carry the community engagement model through Step 6. Steps 7 through 9 will be undertaken by the partnering hospitals, health departments, and other organizations over the next three years, at which time the process begins again and this assessment will be updated. Methodology This assessment incorporates data from both quantitative and qualitative sources . Quantitative data input includes primary research (the PRC Community Health Survey) and secondary research (vital statistics and other existing health -related data); these quantitative components allow for trending and comparison to benchmark data at the s tate and national levels. Qualitative data input includes primary research gathered through an Online Key Informant Survey . PRC Community Health Survey Survey Instrument The survey instrument used for this study is based largely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (B RFSS), as well as various other public health surveys and customized questions addressing gaps in indicator data relative to health promotion and disease prevention objectives and o ther recognized health issues . The final survey instrument was developed by the sponsoring and supporting organizations and PRC , and is similar to the previous survey used in the region, allowing for data trending. COMMUNITY HEA LTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 10 Community Defined for This Assessment The study area for the survey effort (referred to as the \" Metro Area \" in this report) i ncludes Douglas, Sarpy, and Cass counties in Nebraska, as well as Pottawattamie County in Iowa . For this study, Douglas County is further divided into 5 geographical areas (Northeast Omaha, Southeast Omaha, Northwest Omaha, Southwest Omaha, and W estern Douglas County). This community definition is illustrated in the following map. Sample Approach & Design A precise and carefully executed methodology is critical in asserting the validity of the results gathered in the PRC Community Health Survey . Thus, to ensure the best representation of the population surveyed a mi xed-mode methodology was implemented. This included surveys conducted via t elephone (landline and cell phone), as well as through online questionnaires . The sample design used for this effort consisted of a total of 2,527 individuals age 18 and older in the Metro Area . This random sampling of residents reflects 1,527 adults in Douglas County, 500 in Sarpy County, 100 in Cass County, and 400 in Pottawattamie County . The higher sample within Douglas County reflects targets set to achieve 50 surveys per ZIP Code within the county. Once all of the interviews were completed, these w ere weighted in proportion to the actual population distribution so as to appropriately represent the individual counties and the Metro Area as a w hole. All adm inistration of the surveys, data collection , and data analysis was conducted by PRC. COMMUNITY HEA LTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 11 For statis tical purposes, the maximum rate of error associated with a sample size of 2,527 respondents is \u00b1 2.0% at the 95 percent confidence level. Expected Error Ranges for a Sample of 2,527 Respondents at the 95 Percent Level of Confidence Note: The \"response rate\" (the percentage of a population giving a particular response) determines the error rate associated with t hat response. A \"95 percent level of confidence\" indicates that responses would fall within the expected error range on 95 out of 100 trial s. Examples: If 10% of the sample of 2,527 respondents answered a certain question with a \"yes,\" it can be asserted that between 8.9% and 11.1% (10% 1.1%) of the total population would offer this response. If 50% of respondents said \"yes,\" one could be certain with a 95 percent level of confidence that between 48.2% and 51.8% (50 % 1.8%) of the total population would respond if Characteristics To accurately represent the population studied, PRC strives to minimize bias through application of a proven telephone methodology and random -selection techniques . While this random sampling of the population produces a highly representativ e sample, it is a common and preferred practice to \"weight\" the raw data to improve this representativeness even further . This is accomplished by a djusting the results of a random sample to match the geographic distribution and demographic characteristics of the population surveyed (poststratification), so as to eliminate any naturally occurring bias . Specifically, once the raw data are gathered, res pondents are examined by key demographic characteristics (namely sex, age, race, ethnicity, and poverty statu s), and a statistical application package applies weighting variables that produce a sample which more closely matches the population for these cha racteristics . Thus, while the integrity of each individual's responses is maintained, one respondent's respon ses may contribute to the whole the same weight as, for example, 1.1 respondents . Another respondent, whose demographic characteristics may have been slightly oversampled, may contribute the same weight as 0.9 respondents . The following chart outline s the characteristics of the Metro Area sample for key demographic variables, compared to actual population characteristics r evealed in census data . [Note that the sample consisted solely of area residents age 18 and older; data on children were given by proxy by the person most responsible for that child's healthcare needs, and these children are not represented demographically in this chart.] COMMUNITY HEA LTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 12 Population & Survey Sample Characteristics (Metro Area, 2018) Sources: Census 2010, Summary File 3 (SF 3). US Census Bureau. 2018 PRC Community Health Survey, Professional Research Consultants, to 39 40 to 64 65+ White Black Hispanic (Any Race)<200% FPL Actual Population Weighted Survey Sample Further note that the poverty descriptions and segmentation used in this report are based on administrative poverty thresholds d etermined by the US Department of Health & Human Services . These guidelines define poverty status by household income level and number o f persons in the household (e.g., the 201 7 guidelines place the poverty threshold for a family of four at $2 4,400 annual household income or lower . In sample segmentation: \" very low income\" refers to community members living in a household with defined pov erty status; \" low income\" refers to households with incom es just above the poverty level and earning up to twice (100% -199% of) the poverty threshold; and \" mid/high income \" refers to those households living on incomes which are twice or more ( 200% of) the federal poverty level. The sample design and the quality control procedures used in the data collection ensure that the sample is representative . Thus, the findings may be generalized to the total population of community members in the define d area with a high degree of confidence. Online Key Informant Survey To solicit input from key informants, those individuals who have a broad interest in the health of the community, an Online Key Informant Survey also was implemented as part of this proce ss. A list of recommended participants was provided by the sponsoring organizations ; this list included names and contact information for physicians, public health representatives, other health professionals, social service providers, and a variety of othe r community leaders. Potential participants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary concerns of the populations with whom they work, as well as of the community overall . Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of t he survey and providing a link to take the survey online ; reminder emails were sent as needed t o increase participation . In all, 163 community stakeholders took part in the Online Key Informant Survey, as outlined below: COMMUNITY HEA LTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 13 Online Key Informant Survey Partic ipation Key Informant Type Numbe r Invited Number Participating Social Services Providers 119 60 Community Leaders 84 41 Other Health Providers 79 24 Physicians 55 12 Business Leaders 35 11 First Responders 6 5 Public Health Representatives 15 5 Criminal Justice 8 3 Advanced Practice Providers 13 1 Postsecondary Educators 3 1 Final participation included representatives of the organizations outlined below.

Follow -up questions aske d them to describe why they identify problem areas as such and how these might better be addressed. Results of COMMUNITY HEA LTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 15 their ratings, as well as their verbatim co mments, are included throughout this report as they relate to the various other data presented. NOTE: These findings represent qualitative rather than quantitative data. The Online Key Informant Survey was designed to gather input regarding participants ' opinions and perceptions of the health needs of the residents in the area. Thus, these findings are not necessarily based on fact . Public Health, Vital Statistics & Other Data A variety of existing (secondary) data sources was consulted to complement the re search quality of this Community Health Needs Assessment . Data for the Metro Area were obtained from t he following sources (specific citations are included with the graphs throughout this report): Center for Applied Research and Environmental Systems (CA RES) Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Infectious Disease, National Center for HIV/A IDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Public Health Science Services, Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services, Division of Health Informatics and Surveillance (DHIS) Centers f or Disease Control & Prevention, Office of Public Health Science Services, National Center for Health Statistics Community Commons Douglas County (Nebraska) Health Department ESRI ArcGIS Map Gallery National Cancer Institute, State Cancer Profiles OpenStre etMap (OSM) US Census Bureau, American Community Survey US Census Bureau, County Business Patterns US Census Bureau, Decennial Census US Departmen t of Agriculture, Economic Research Service US Department of Health & Human Services US Department of Health & Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation US Department of La bor, Bureau of Labor Statistics COMMUNITY HEA LTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 16 Benchmark Data Trending Similar survey s were administered in the Metro Area in 2002 (Douglas County only), 2008 (Douglas, Sarpy, Cass counties only), 2011 , and 2015 by PRC . Trending data, as revealed by comparison to prior survey results, are provided throughout this report whenever available . Historical data for secondary data i ndicators are also included for the purposes of trending. Nebraska & Iowa Risk Factor Data Statewide risk factor data are provid ed where available as additional benchmark s against which to compare local survey findings; these data represent the most recent BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) Prevalence and Trend s Data published online by the Centers for Disease Contr ol and Prevention . State -level vital statistics are also provided for comparison of secondary data indicators. Nationwide Risk F actor Data Nationwide risk factor data, which are also provided in comparison charts, are taken from the 2017 PRC National Health Survey ; the methodological approach for the national study is similar to that employed in this assessment, and these data may be generalized to the US population with a high degree of confidence. National -level vital statistics are als o provided for comparison of secondary data indicators. Healthy People 2020 Healthy People provides science -based, 10 -year national objectives for improving the health of all Americans . For three decades, Healthy People has established benchmarks and moni tored progress over time in order to: Encourage collaborations across communities and sectors. Empower individuals toward making informed health d ecisions. Measure the impact of prevention activities. Healthy People strives to: Identify nationwide health improvement priorities. Increase public awareness and understanding of the determinants of health, disease, and disability and the opportunities for progress. Provide measurable objectives and goals th at are applicable at the national, State, and local levels. Engage multiple sectors to take actions to strengthen policies and improve practices that are driven by the best available evidence and know ledge. Identify critical research, evaluation, and data collection needs. COMMUNITY HEA LTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 17 Determining Significance Differences noted in this report represent those determined to be significant . For survey - derived indicators (which are subject to sampling error), statisti cal significance is determined based on confidence inter vals (at the 95 percent confidence level) , using question -specific samples and response rates . For the purpose of this report, \"significance\" of secondary data indicators (which do not carry sampling error , but might be subject to reporting error) is deter mined by a 5% variation from the comparative measure . Information Gaps While this assessment is quite comprehensive, it cannot measure all possible aspects of health in the community, nor can it adeq uately represent all possible populations of interest . It must be recognized that these information gaps might in some ways limit the ability to assess all of the community's health needs. For example, certain population groups \u2014 such as the homeless, ins titutionalized persons, or those who only speak a langua ge other than English or Spanish \u2014 are not represented in the survey data . Other population groups \u2014 for example, pregnant women, lesbian/gay/bisexual/ transgender residents, undocumented residents, a nd members of certain racia l/ethnic or immigrant groups \u2014 might not be identifiable or might not be represented in numbers sufficient for independent analyses . In terms of content, this assessment was designed to provide a comprehensive and broad picture of the health of the overall community . However, there a re certainly medical conditions that are not specifically addressed . COMMUNITY HEA LTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 18 Summary of Findings Significant Health Needs of the Community The following \"Areas of O pportunity\" represent the significant health needs of the community, based on the information gathered through this Community Health Needs Assessment and the gu idelines set forth in Healthy People 2020 . From these data, opportunities for health improvement exist in the area with regard to the following health issues (see also the summary tables presented in the following section). The Areas of Opportunity , prese nted alphabetically below, were determined after consideration of various criteria, including: standing in comparison with benchmark data (particularly national data) ; identified trends; the preponderance of significant findings within topic areas; the mag nitude of the issue in terms of the number of persons affected; and the potential health impact of a given issue . These also take into account those issues of greatest concern to the community stakeholders (key informants) giving input to this process. Areas of Opportunity Identified Through This Assessment Access to Healthcare Services Specific Source of Ongoing Medical Care Emergency Room Utilization Cancer Cancer is a leading cause of death .

Community Feedback on Prioritization of Health Needs On November 5, 2018, findings fro m this Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) were presented at Live Well Omaha's 2018 Ch angemaker Summit. The Changemaker Summit is the region's largest multi -sector health conference, which gathers more than 170 leaders from across Douglas, Sarpy, Cas s and Pottawattamie Counties to celebrate the milestones of our collective work and advance future work while learning from local, regional and national experts. At this event, Professional Research Consultants, Inc. (PRC) highlighted data reflecting the significant health issues identified from the research (see Areas of Opportunity above). In addition, data were also shared specific to a Forces of Change Assessment, a Local Public Health Systems Assessment , and a Community Strengths and Themes Assessment conducted by the Douglas County Health Department . Following the presentation, attendees b roke into small groups for reflection and sharing, structured around the following questions: COMMUNITY HEA LTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 20 What stood out to you in the data, and why? Why is this important to th e health of those facing the greatest inequities? Where are themes beginning to align for a ction? How do the facts align between the numbers and the story told by the additional assessments completed by the health department? Once reconvened, the small gr oups shared an overview of their discussions with the larger group. Then, attendees were provided an explanation of the prioritization exercise that followed. In order to assign priority to the identified health needs (i.e., A reas of Opportunity), a wireless audience response system was used in which each participant was able to register his/her ratings of health issues using a small remote keypad. Individuals' ratings yielded the following prioritized list of community health needs for adults in the Metr o Area: 1. Mental Health 2. Nutrition, Diabetes and Physical Activity 3. Access to Health Care Services 4. Substance Abuse 5. Injury & Violence Organizations sponsoring or supporting this CHNA will use the information from this Community Health Needs Assessment to deve lop implementation strategies to address the significant health needs in the community. The results of this prioritization exercise will be used to inform the development of action plans to guide community health i mprovement efforts in the coming years. COMMUNITY HEA LTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 21 Summary Tables: Comparisons With Benchmark Data The following tables provide an overview of indicators in the Metro Area , including comparisons among the individual commu nities, as well as trend data . These data are grouped to correspond with the Focus Areas presented in Healthy People 2020. Reading the Sum mary Tables In the following charts, Metro Area results are shown in the larger, blue column . The yellow columns [to the left of the green county columns] provide comparisons among the five subar eas within Douglas County, i dentifying differences for each as \"better d) the combined opposing areas. The green columns [to the left of the Metro Area column] provide comparisons among the four counties asse ssed , identifying differences ( d) the combined opposing areas. The columns to the right of the Metro Area column provide trending, as well as comparisons between local data and any availa ble state and national findings, and Healthy People 2020 targets . Again, symbols indicate whether the Metro Area compares favorably (B), unfavorably ( h), or comparably ( d) to these external data. Tip: Indicator labels beginning with a \"%\" symbol are taken from the PRC Community Health Survey; the remaining indicators are taken from secondary data sources. Note that blank table cells signify that data are not available or are not reliable for that area and/or for that indicator. TREND SUMMARY (Current vs. Baseline Data) Survey Data Indicators: Trends for survey -derived indicators represent significant changes since 2011. Other (Secondary) Data Indicators: Trends for other indicators (e.g., public health data) represent point -to-point changes between the most current reporting period and the earliest presented in this report (typically representing the span of roughly a decade).

COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 51 Social Determinants of Health About Social Determinants Health starts in our homes, schools, workplaces, neighborhoods, and communities. We know that taking care of ourselves by eating well and staying active, not smoking, getting the recommended immun izations and screening tests, and seeing a doctor when we are sick all influence our health. Our health is also determined in pa rt by access to social and economic opportunities; the resources and supports available in our homes, neighborhoods, and communi ties; the quality of our schooling; the safety of our workplaces; the cleanliness of our water, food, and air; and the nature of our social interactions and relationships. The conditions in which we live explain in part why some Americans are healthier tha n others and why Americans more generally are not as healthy as they could be.

Improve the conditions of daily life by: encouraging communities to be accessible so all can live in, move through, and interact with their environment; encouraging community living; and removing barriers in the environment using both physical universal design concepts and operational policy shifts. Address the inequitable distribution of resources among people with disabilities and those without disabili ties by increasing: appropriate health care for people with disabilities; education and work opportun ities; social participation; and access to needed technologies and assistive supports. Expand the knowledge base and raise awareness about determinants of health for people with disabilities by increasing: the inclusion of people with disabilities in publi c health data collection efforts across the lifespan; the inclusion of people with disabilities in health promotion activities; and the expansion of disabi lity and health training opportunities for public health and health care professionals.

Mental health is essential to personal well -being, family and interpersonal relationships, an d the ability to contribute to community or society . Mental disorders are health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, and/or behavior that are associated with distress and/or impaired functioning. Mental disorders contribute to a host of problems that may include disability, pain, or death. Mental illness is the term that refers collectively to all diagnosable mental disorders . Mental disorders are among the most common causes of disability. The resulting disease burden of men tal illness is among the highest of all diseases. Mental health and physi cal health are closely connected. Mental health plays a major role in people's ability to maintain good physical health. Mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, affect peop le's ability to participate in health -promoting behaviors. In turn, proble ms with physical health, such as chronic diseases, can have a serious impact on mental health and decrease a person's ability to participate in treatment and recovery. The existing model for understanding mental health and mental disorders emphasizes the interaction of social, environmental, and genetic factors throughout the lifespan. In behavioral health, researchers identify: risk factors , which predispose individuals to mental il lness; and protective factors , which protect them from developing mental d isorders . Researchers now know that the prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral (MEB) disorders is inherently interdisciplinary and draws on a variety of different strategies . Over the past 20 years, research on the prevention of mental disorders h as progressed. The major areas of progress include evidence that: MEB disorders are common and begin early in life. The greatest opportunity for prevention is among young people. There are multiyear effects of multiple preventive interventions on reducing substance abuse, conduct disorder, antisocial behavior, aggression, and child maltreatment. The incidence of depression among pregnant women and adolescents can be reduced. School -based violence prevention can reduce the base rate of aggressive pr oblems in an average school by 25 to 33%. There are potential indicated preventive interventions for schizophrenia. Improving family functioning and positive parenting can have positive outco mes on mental health and can reduce poverty -related risk. School -based preventive interventions aimed at improving social and emotional outcomes can also improve academic outcomes. Interventions targeting families dealing with adversities, such as parental depression or divorce, can be effective in reducing risk for dep ression in children and increasing effective parenting. Some preventive interventions have benefits that exceed costs, with the available evidence strongest for early childhood interventions. Implementation is complex, and it is important that interventions be relevant to the target audiences.

To gether, heart disease and stroke are among the most widespread and costly health problems facing the nation today, accounting for more tha n $500 billion in healthcare expenditures and related expenses in 2010 alone. Fortunately, they are also among the mos t preventable. The leading modifiable (controllable) risk factors for heart disease and stroke are: High blood pressure High cholesterol Cigarette smoking Diabetes Poor diet and physical inactivity Overweight and obesity The risk of Americans developing a nd dying from cardiovascular disease would be substantially reduced if major improvements were made across the US population in diet and p hysical activity, control of high blood pressure and cholesterol, smoking cessation, and appropriate aspirin use. The burden of cardiovascular disease is disproportionately distributed across the population. There are significant disparities in the follow ing based on gender, age, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and socioeconomic status: Prevalence of risk factors Access to treatment Appropriate and timely treatment Treatment outcomes Mortality Disease does not occur in isolation, and cardiovascular diseas e is no exception. Cardiovascular health is significantly influenced by the physical, social, and political environmen t, including: maternal and child health; access to educational opportunities; availability of healthy foods, physical education, and extra curricular activities in schools; opportunities for physical activity, including access to safe and walkable communiti es; access to healthy foods; quality of working conditions and worksite health; availability of community support and resources; and acces s to affordable, quality healthcare. Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Age-Adjusted Heart Disease & Stroke Deaths Heart Disease Deaths Between 2014 and 2016 there was an annual average age -adjusted heart disease mortality rate of 143.2 deaths per 100,000 population in the Metro Area .

Among people who develop cancer, more than half will be alive in five years . Yet, cancer remains a leading cause of death in the United States, second only to heart disease. Many cancers are preventable by reducing risk factors such as: use of to bacco products; physical inactivity and poor nutrition; obesity; and ultraviolet light exposure . Other cancers can be prevented by getting vaccinated against human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus . In the past decade, overweight and obesity have emerge d as new risk factors for developing certain cancers, including colorectal, breast, uterine corpus (endometrial), and kidney cancers. The impact of the current weight trends on cancer incidence will not be fully known for several decades. Continue d focus o n preventing weight gain will lead to lower rates of cancer and many chronic diseases.

All cancers caused by cigarette smoking could be prevented. At least one -third of cancer deaths that occur in the Unite d States are due to cigarette smoking. According to the American Cancer Society, about one -third of cancer deaths that occur in the United States each year are due to nutrition and physical activ ity factors, including obesity. National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention RELATED ISSUE: See also Nutrition , Physical Activity , Weight Status, and Tobacco Use in the Modifiable Health Risk s section of this report. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 119 Cancer Screenings The American Cancer Society recommends that both men and women get a cancer -related checku p during a regular doctor's checkup. It should include exami nation for cancers of the thyroid, testicles, ovaries, lymph nodes, oral cavity, and skin, as well as health counseling about tobacco, sun exposure, diet and nutrition, risk factors, sexual practi ces, and environmental and occupational exposures. Screening levels in the community were measured in the PRC Community Health Survey relative to three cancer sites: female breast cancer (mammography); cervical cancer (Pap smear testing); and colorectal ca ncer (sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood testing). Female Breast Cancer Screening About Screening for Breast Cancer The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening mammography, with or without clinical breast examination (CBE), every 1-2 years for women age 40 and older. Rationale: Th e USPSTF found fair evidence that mammography screening every 12 -33 months significantly reduces mortality from breast cancer. Evidence is strongest for women age 50 -69, the age group generally included in screening trials. For women age 40 -49, the evidenc e that screening mammography reduces mortality from breast cancer is weaker, and the absolute benefit of mammography is smaller, than it is for older women. Most, but not all, studies indicate a mortalit y benefit for women undergoing mammography at ages 40 -49, but the delay in observed benefit in women younger than 50 makes it difficult to determine the incremental benefit of beginning screening at age 40 rather than at age 50. The absolute benefit is sma ller because the incidence of breast cancer is lower among women in their 40s than it is among older women. The USPSTF concluded that the evidence is also generalizable to women age 70 and older (who face a higher absolute risk for breast cancer) if their life expectancy is not compromised by comorbid diseas e. The absolute probability of benefits of regular mammography increase along a continuum with age, whereas the likelihood of harms from screening (false -positive results and unnecessary anxiety, biopsie s, and cost) diminish from ages 40 -70. The balance of benefits and potential harms, therefore, grows more favorable as women age.

Rationale: The USPSTF found good evidence from multiple observational studies that screening with ce rvical cytology (Pap smears) reduces incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer. Direct evidence to dete rmine the optimal starting and stopping age and interval for screening is limited. Indirect evidence suggests most of the benefit can be obtained b y beginning screening within 3 years of onset of sexual activity or age 21 (whichever comes first) and screen ing at least every 3 years. The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening substantially outweigh potential harms. The USPSTF recommends again st routinely screening women older than age 65 for cervical cancer if they have had adequate recent screening with normal Pap smears and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer. Rationale: The USPSTF found limited evidence to determine the bene fits of continued screening in women older than 65. The yield of screening is low in previously screened wome n older than 65 due to the declining incidence of high -grade cervical lesions after middle age. There is fair evidence that screening women older than 65 is associated with an increased risk for potential harms, including false -positive results and invasiv e procedures. The USPSTF concludes that the potential harms of screening are likely to exceed benefits among older women who have had normal result s previously and who are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer. The USPSTF recommends against routin e Pap smear screening in women who have had a total hysterectomy for benign disease. Rationale: The USPSTF found fair evidence that the yield of c ytologic screening is very low in women after hysterectomy and poor evidence that screening to detect vaginal cancer improves health outcomes. The USPSTF concludes that potential harms of continued screening after hysterectomy are likely to exceed benefits .

The evidence is convincing that screening for colorectal cance r with fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy detects early -stage cancer and adenomatous polyps . There is convincing evidence that screening with any o f the three recommended tests (fecal occult blood testing , sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy) reduces colorectal cancer mortality in adults age 50 to 75 years . Follow -up of positive screening test results requires colonoscopy regardless of the screening test used .

It seems to be in every family. - Social Servi ces Provider, Douglas County Many citizens are affected with these conditions which increases their utilization of health services. - Public Health Representative, Douglas County Cancer continues to impact the lives of more and more people of all ages in o ur community . Although the trend is moving in the right direction, it seems there is more we can do. - Social Services Provider, Douglas County This community built a cancer center. - Social Services Provider, Douglas County The number of deaths from cance r, particularly breast cancer. - Other Health Provider, Douglas County Because it's so rampant here they've built a cancer center . If they didn't feel they'd have the volume, they wouldn't have built it. Everyone from child to young adult, middle aged adul t and the aged are being diagnosed. - Social Services Provider, Douglas County There are so many various type of cancers and due to my years of working in healthcare, seeing and dealing with cancer patients. - Social Services Provider, Douglas Co unty There are so many different types of cancer that affect each and every demographic in devastating ways, such as financially, emotionally, spiritually and mentally. - Community Leader, Douglas County Cancer is major problem because there are so many different types, different reasons why a person may get cancer, genetics, exposures . Late diagnosis because of barriers resulting in late entry to care . For example, Every Woman Matters. - Community Leader, Douglas County Because of the many forms of cance r that are caused by preventive measures, there is a little known between certain cancers and the social determinants of health. - Social Services Provider, Douglas County COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 125 The increasing rate at which Douglas County residents are being diagnosed. Also, due to limited health insurance, low income people with cancer have trouble accessing treatment. - Social Services Provider, Douglas County Access to Care/Services No local accessibility for treatment or care . Must commute to Omaha or Lincoln for services. - First Responder, Cass County Since we do not know all the causes of cancer, it is harder to diagnosis and treat . We have amazing new facilities and think it will have an impact in the near future. - Community Leader, Douglas County I believe a large number of individuals do not access care due to the cost of treatment. - Business Leader, Pottawattamie County I think many patients miss cancer screening opportunities because of lack of access to care. - Advanced Practice Provider, Douglas County I developed a theory called \"I don't need no more bad news\". Generally access to services is so poor that some segments of the community worry that if they are diagnosed with cancer, they won't be able to afford the care that might improve/prolong life. - Social Servic es Provider, Douglas County Leading Cause of Death Cancer is the leading cause of death among Douglas County residents. - Other Health Provider, Douglas County Cancer is life threatening, thus it is a major problem. - First Responder, Douglas County The de ath certificate, vital statistics indicate that cancer, in all its forms, continue to be a major concern for this community. - Public Health Representative, Douglas County Health Awareness/Education Lack of knowledge of ways how to get cancer, causes of canc er, ways to prevent cancer, advancements in cancer treatment, cancer support groups. - Social Services Provider, Douglas County Awareness around risk factors for cancer among the community, outside of tobacco, is very low. Community and doctor -patient conv ersations need to focus more on addressing these links in order to build community support for environmental change and better. - Social Services Provider, Douglas County Affordable Care/Services Lower income population not having routine examinations. - Other Health Provider, Douglas County Environmental Contributors In the rural communities, I believe this is a problem due to the large number of pesticides and other harmful chemicals farmers have been using to treat cattle and crops . I also have seen a si gnificant rise in the number of people who know someone. - Business Leader, Pottawattamie County Health Disparities The health disparities in cancer are the problem . Certain racial/ethnic backgroun ds are more likely at risk. - Social Services Provider, Pottawattamie County Prevention Lack of person's willingness to take advantage of preventative screenings and tests. - Community Leader, Douglas County Tobacco Use Tobacco use. - Community Leader, Douglas County COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 126 Respiratory Disease About Asthma & COPD Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are significant public health burdens. Specific methods of detection, intervention, and treatment exist that may reduce this burden and promote health. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of th e airw ays characterized by episodes of reversible breathing problems due to airway narrowing and obstruction. These episodes can range in severity from mild to life threatening. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of bre ath. Daily preventive treatment can prevent symptoms and attacks and enable individuals who have asthma to lead active lives. COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow l imitat ion is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases (typically from exposure to cigarette smoke). Treatment can lessen symptoms and improve quality of life for those with COPD. The bur den of respiratory diseases affects individuals and their families, schools, workplaces, neighborhoods, cities, and states. Because of the cost to the healthcare system, the burden of respiratory diseases also falls on society; it is paid for with hi gher h ealth insurance rates, lost productivity, and tax dollars. Annual healthcare expenditures for asthma alone are estimated at $20.7 billion. Asthma . The prevalence of asthma has increased since 1980. However, deaths from asthma have decreased since th e mid -1990s. The causes of asthma are an active area of research and involve both genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors for asthma currently being investigated include: Having a parent with asthma Sensitization to irritants and allergens Respiratory in fections in childhood Overweight Asthma affects people of every race, sex, and age. However, significant disparities in asthma morbidity and mortality exist, in particular for low -income and minority populations. Populations with higher rates of asthma include: children; women (among adults) and boys (among children); African Americans; Puerto Ricans; people living in the Northeast United States; people living below the Federal poverty level; and employees with certain exposures in the workpl ace. While the re is not a cure for asthma yet, there are diagnoses and treatment guidelines that are aimed at ensuring that all people with asthma live full and active lives.

Both unintentional injuries and those caused by acts of violence are among the top 15 killers for Americans of all ages. Many people accept them as \"acc idents,\" \"acts of fate,\" or as \"part of life.\" However, most events resulting in injury, disability, or death are predictable and preventable. Injuries are the leading cause of death for Americans ages 1 to 44, and a leading cause of disability for all ages, regardless of sex, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. More than 180,000 people die from injuries each year, and approximately 1 in 10 sustains a nonfatal injury serious enough to be treated in a hospital emergency department. Beyond their immedi ate health consequences, injuries and violence have a s ignificant impact on the well - being of Americans by contributing to: Premature death Disability Poor mental health High medical costs Lost productivity The effects of injuries and violence extend beyon d the injured person or victim of violence to family me mbers, friends, coworkers, employers, and communities. Numerous factors can affect the risk of unintentional injury and violence, including individual behaviors, physical environment, access to health services (ranging from pre -hospital and acute care to rehabilitation), and social environment (from parental monitoring and supervision of youth to peer group associations, neighborhoods, and communities). Interventions addressing these social and physica l factors have the potential to prevent unintentional i njuries and violence. Efforts to prevent unintentional injury may focus on: Modifications of the environment Improvements in product safety Legislation and enforcement Education and behavior change Technology and engineering Efforts to prevent violence may focus on: Changing social norms about the acceptability of violence Improving problem -solving skills (for example, parenting, conflict resolution, coping) Changing policies to address the social and e conomic conditions that often give rise to violence Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Leading Causes of Accidental Death Falls, m otor vehicle accidents, and poisoning (including accidental drug overdose) accounted for most accidental deaths in the Metro Area between 2014 and 2016.

Hispanics can be of any race. Other race categories are non -Hispanic categorizations (e.g., \"White\" reflects non -Hispanic White respondents). Falls Falls Each year, an estimated one -third of older adults fall, and the likelihood of falling incr eases substantially with advancing age . In 2005, a total of 15,802 persons age 65 years died as a result of injuries from falls. Falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injurie s for persons aged 65 years ... I n 2006, approximately 1.8 million persons aged 65 years (nearly 5% of all p ersons in that age group) sustained some type of recent fall -related injury . Even when those injuries are minor, they can seriously affect older adults' quality of life by inducing a fear of falling, which can lead to self -imposed activity restrictions, so cial isolation, and depression. In addition, fall -related medical treatment places a burden on US healthcare services . In 2000, direct medical costs for fall -related injuries totaled approximately $19 billion . A recent study determined that 31.8% of older adults who sustained a fall -related injury required help with activities of daily living as a result, and among them, 58.5% were expected to require help for at least 6 months. Modifiable fall risk factors include muscle weakness, gait and balance problems , poor vision, use of psychoactive medications, and home hazards . Falls among older adults can be reduced through evidence -based fall -prevention programs that address these modifiable risk factors . Most effective interventions focus on exercise, alone or a s part of a multifaceted approach that includes medication management, vision correction, and home modifications. Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 141 Between 2014 and 2016, there was an annu al average age -adjusted fall-related mortality rate of 70.7 deaths (age 65+) per 100,000 population in the Metro Area.

Insulin is a hormone that the body needs to abso rb and use glucose (sugar) as fuel for the body's cells. Without a prope rly functioning insulin signaling system, blood glucose levels become elevated and other metabolic abnormalities occur, leading to the development of serious, disabling complications . Many forms of diabetes exist; the three common types are Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes . Effective therapy can prevent or delay diabetic complications. Diabetes mellitus: Lowers life expectancy by up to 15 years. Increases the risk of heart dise ase by 2 to 4 times. Is the leading cause of kidney failure, lower limb amputations, and adult -onset blindness. The rate of diabetes mellitus continues to increase both in the United States and throughout the world. Due to the steady rise in the number of persons with diabetes mellitus, and possibly earlier onset of type 2 dia betes mellitus, there is growing concern about the possibility that the increase in the number of persons with diabetes mellitus and the complexity of their care might overwhelm existi ng healthcare systems. People from minority populations are more frequen tly affected by type 2 diabetes. Minority groups constitute 25% of all adult patients with diabetes in the US and represent the majority of children and adolescents with type 2 diabete s. Lifestyle change has been proven effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in high -risk individuals.

Alzheimer 's disease is the 6th leading cause of death among adults age 18 ye ars and older. Estimates vary, but experts suggest that up to 5.1 million Americans age 65 years and older have Alzheimer's disease. These numbers are predicted to more than double by 2050 unless more effective ways to treat and prevent Alzheimer's disease are found.

They are responsible for premat ure death and exact a high economic price from both the private and public sectors . Nearly 25% of the Medicare budget is used to treat people with chronic kidney disease and end -stage renal disease. Genetic determinants have a large influence on the develo pment and progression of chronic kidney disease. It is not possible to alter a person's biology and genetic de terminants; however, environmental influences and individual behaviors also have a significant influence on the development and progression of chr onic kidney disease. As a result, some populations are disproportionately affected. Successful behavior modifi cation is expected to have a positive influence on the disease . Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure. The results of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK ) show that moderate exercise, a healthier diet, and weight reduction can prevent development of type 2 diabetes in persons at risk.

Arthritis commonly occurs with other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Interventions to tr eat the pain and reduce the functional limitations from arthritis are important, and may also enable people with these other chronic conditions to be more physically active. Arthr itis affects 1 in 5 adults and continues to be the most common cause of disab ility. It costs more than $128 billion per year. All of the human and economic costs are projected to increase over time as the population ages. There are interventions that can r educe arthritis pain and functional limitations, but they remain underused. T hese include: increased physical activity; self -management education; and weight loss among overweight/obese adults. Osteoporosis is a disease marked by reduced bone strength lea ding to an increased risk of fractures (broken bones). In the United States, an estimated 5.3 million people age 50 years and older have osteoporosis. Most of these people are women, but about 0.8 million are men. Just over 34 million more people, includin g 12 million men, have low bone mass, which puts them at increased risk for d eveloping osteoporosis. Half of all women and as many as 1 in 4 men age 50 years and older will have an osteoporosis -related fracture in their lifetime. Chronic back pain is comm on, costly, and potentially disabling. About 80% of Americans experience low back pain in their lifetime. It is estimated that each year: 15%-20% of the population develop protracted back pain. 2-8% have chronic back pain (pain that lasts more than 3 month s). 3-4% of the population is temporarily disabled due to back pain. 1% of th e working -age population is disabled completely and permanently as a result of low back pain. Americans spend at least $50 billion each year on low back pain. Low back pain is the : 2nd leading cause of lost work time (after the common cold). 3rd most commo n reason to undergo a surgical procedure. 5th most frequent cause of hospitalization. Arthritis, osteoporosis, and chronic back conditions all have major effects on quality of lif e, the ability to work, and basic activities of daily living . Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Nearly 3 in 10 Metro Area adults (29.4%) report suffering from some type of chronic pain.

An esti mated 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV, and 1 in 5 people with HIV do not know they have it. HIV continues to spread, leading to about 56,000 new HIV infections each year. HIV is a preventable disease, and effective HIV prevention interventions h ave been p roven to reduce HIV transmission. People who get tested for HIV and learn that they are infected can make significant behavior changes to improve their health and reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to their sex or drug -using partners. More than 50% of new HIV infections occur as a result of the 21% of people who have HIV but do not know it. In the era of increasingly effective treatments for HIV, people with HIV are living longer, healthier, and more productive lives. Deaths from HIV infection ha ve greatly declined in the United States since the 1990s. As the number of people living with HIV grows, it will be more important than ever to increase national HIV prevention and healthcare programs. There are gender, race, and ethnicity disparities in n ew HIV inf ections: Nearly 75% of new HIV infections occur in men. More than half occur in gay and bisexual men, regardless of race or ethnicity. 45% of new HIV infections occur in African Americans, 35% in whites, and 17% in Hispanics. Improving access to quality h ealthcare for populations disproportionately affected by HIV, such as persons of color and gay and bisexual men, is a fundamental public health strategy for HIV prevention. People getting care for HIV can receive: Antiretroviral therapy Screenin g and trea tment for other diseases (such as sexually transmitted infections) HIV prevention interventions Mental health services Other health services As the number of people living with HIV increases and more people become aware of their HIV status, prevention str ategies that are targeted specifically for HIV -infected people are becoming more important. Prevention work with people living with HIV focuses on: Linking to and staying in treatment. Increasing the availability of ongoing HIV prevention interv entions. Providing prevention services for their partners. Public perception in the US about the seriousness of the HIV epidemic has declined in recent years. There is evidence that risky behaviors may be increasing among uninfected people, especially gay and bisexu al men. Ongoing media and social campaigns for the general public and HIV prevention interventions for uninfected persons who engage in risky behaviors are critical.

Despite their burdens, costs, and complications, and the fact that they are largely pr eventable, STDs remain a significant public health problem in the United States. This problem is largely unrecognized by the public, policymakers, and health care professionals. STDs cause many harmful, often irreversible, and costly clinical complications , such as: reproductive health problems; fetal and perinatal health problems; cancer; and facilitation of the sexual transmission of HIV infection. Because many cases of STDs go undiagnosed \u2014and some common viral infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and genital herpes, are not reported to CDC at all \u2014the reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrh ea, and syphilis represent only a fraction of the true burden of STDs in the US. Untreated STDs can lead to serious long -term health consequence s, especially for adolescent girls and young women . Several factors contribute to the spread of STDs. Biologica l Factors . STDs are acquired during unprotected sex with an infected partner. Biological factors that affect the spread of STDs include: Asympt omatic nature of STDs . The majority of STDs either do not produce any symptoms or signs, or they produce symptom s so mild that they are unnoticed; consequently, many infected persons do not know that they need medical care. Gender disparities . Women suffer more frequent and more serious STD complications than men do. Among the most serious STD complications are pelv ic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside of the uterus), infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Age disparities . Compared t o older adults, sexually active adolescents ages 15 to 19 and young adults ages 20 to 24 are at higher risk for getting STDs. Lag time between infection and complications . Often, a long interval, sometimes years, occurs between acquiring an STD and recogn izing a clinically significant health problem. Social, Economic , and Behavioral Factors . The spread of STDs is d irectly affected by social, economic, and behavioral factors. Such factors may cause serious obstacles to STD prevention due to their influence on social and sexual networks, access to and provision of care, willingness to seek care, and social norms regar ding sex and sexuality. Among certain vulnerable populations, historical experience with segregation and discrimination exacerbates these factor s. Social, economic, and behavioral factors that affect the spread of STDs include: racial and ethnic disparitie s; poverty and marginalization; access to healthcare; substance abuse; sexuality and secrecy (stigma and discomfort discussing sex); and sexual networks (persons \"linked\" by sequential or concurrent sexual partners) .

Their well-being determines the health of the next generation and can help predict future public health challenges for families, communities, and the healthcare system. The risk of maternal and infant mortality and pregnancy - related complications can be reduced by increasing access to quality preconception (before pregnancy) and inter-conception (between pregnancies) care. Moreover , healthy birth outcomes and early identification and treatment of health conditions among infant s can prevent death or disability and enable children to reach their full potential. Many factors can affect pregnancy and childbirth, including pre -conception health status, age, access to appropriate healthcare, and poverty. Infant and child health are s imilarly influenced by socio -demographic factors, such as family income, but are also linked to the physical and mental health of parents and caregivers . There are racial and ethnic disparities in mortality and morbidity for mothers and children, particula rly for African Americans. These differences are likely the result of many factors, including social determinants (such as racial and ethnic disparities in inf ant mortality; family income; educational attainment among household members; and health insuranc e coverage) and physical determinants (i.e., the health, nutrition, and behaviors of the mother during pregnancy and early childhood).

Efforts to change diet and weight should ad dress individual behaviors, as well as the policies and environments that support these behaviors in settings such as schools, worksites, healthcare organizations, and communities. The goal of promoting healthful diets and healthy weight encompasses increa sing h ousehold food security and eliminating hunger. Americans with a healthful diet: Consume a variety of nutrient -dense foods within and across the food groups, especially whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low -fat or fat -free milk or milk products, and lean meats and other protein sources. Limit the intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, added sugars, sodium (salt), and alcohol. Limit caloric intake to meet caloric needs. Diet and body weight are related to health status. Good nutrition is imp ortant to the growth and development of children. A healthful diet also helps Americans reduce their risks for many health conditions, including: overweight and obesity; malnutrition; iron -deficiency constipation; diverticular disease; and some cancers. Diet reflects the variety of foods and beverages consumed over time and in settings such as worksites, schools, restaurants, and the home. Interventions to support a healthier diet can help ensure that: Individuals have the knowledge and skills to make healthier choices. Healthier options are available and affordable. Social Determinants of Diet . Demographic characteristics of those wit h a more healthful diet vary with the nutrient or food studied. However, most Americans need to improve some aspect of their diet. Social factors thought to influence diet include: Knowledge and attitudes Skills Social support Societal and cultural norms Food and agricultural policies Food assistance programs Economic price systems Physical Determinants of Diet . Access to and availability of healthier foods can help people follow healthful diets. For example, better access to retail venues that sell healt hier options may have a positive impact on a person's diet; these venues may be less available in low -income or rural neighborhoods. The places where people eat appear to influence their diet. For example, foods eaten away from home often have more calori es and are of lower nutritional quality than foods prepared at home. Marketing also influences people's \u2014particularly children's \u2014food choices.

Among adults, physical activity can lower the risk of: early death; coronary heart disease; stroke; high blood pressure; type 2 diabetes; breast and colon cancer; falls; and depression . Among children and adolescents, physical activity can: improve bone health; improve cardiorespiratory and muscular fitne ss; decrease levels of body fat; and reduce symptoms of depression . For people who are inactive, even small increases in physical activity are associated with health benefits. Personal, social, economic, and environmental factors all play a role in physica l activity levels among youth, adults, and older adults. Understanding the barriers to and facilitators of physical activity is important t o ensure the effectiveness of interventions and other actions to improve levels of physical activity. Factors positiv ely associated with adult physical activity include: postsecondary education; higher income; enjoyment of exercise; expectation of benefits; belief in ability to exercise (self -efficacy); history of activity in adulthood; social support from peers, family, or spouse; access to and satisfaction with facilities; enjoyable scenery; and safe neighborhoods. Factors negatively associated with adult physical activity include: advancing age; low income; lack of time; low motivation; rural residency; perception of g reat effort needed for exercise; overweight or obesity; perception of poor health; and being disabled . Older adults may have additional factors that keep them from being physically active, including lack of social support, lack of transportation to facilit ies, fear of injury, and cost of programs. Among children ages 4 to 12, the following factors have a positive association with physical activity: gender (boys); belief in ability to be active (self -efficacy); and parental support. Among adolescents ages 1 3 to 18, the following factors have a positive association with physical activity: parental education; gender (boys); personal goals; physical education/school sports; belief in ability to be active (self -efficacy); and support of friends and family. Envir onmental influences positively associated with physical activity among children and adolescents include: Presence of sidewalks Having a destination/walking to a particular place Access to public transportation Low traffic density Access to neighborhood or school play area and/or recreational equipment People with disabilities may be less likely to participate in physical activity due to physical, emotional, and psychological barriers. Barriers may include the inaccessibility of facilities and the lack of staff trained in working with people with disabilities.

Metro Area COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 228 Weight Status About Overweight & Obesity Because weight is influenced by energy (calories) consumed and expended, i nterventions to improve weight can support changes in diet or physical activity. They can help change individuals ' knowledge and skills, reduce exposure to foods low in nutritional value and high in calories, or increase opportunities for physical activity . Interventions can help prevent unhealthy weight gain or facilitate weight loss among obese people. They can be delivered in multiple settings, including healthcare settings, worksites, or schools. The social and physical factors affecting diet and physi cal activity (see Physical Activity topic area) may also have an impact on weight. Obesity is a problem throughou t the population. However, among adults, the prevalence is highest for middle -aged people and for non -Hispanic black and Mexican American women . Among children and adolescents, the prevalence of obesity is highest among older and Mexican American children and non -Hispanic black girls. The association of income with obesity varies by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Healthy People 2020 (www.healt hypeople.gov) Body Mass Index (BMI), which describes relative weight for height, is significantly correlated with total body fat content. The BMI should be used to assess overweight and obesity and to monitor changes in body weight. In addition, measureme nts of body weight alone can be used to determine efficacy of weight loss therapy. BMI is calculate d as weight (kg)/height squared (m2). To estimate BMI using pounds and inches, use: [weight (pounds)/height squared (inches2)] x 703. In this report, overwe ight is defined as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 and obesity as a BMI 30 kg/m2. The rationale behind these definitions is based on epidemiological data that show increases in mortality with BMIs above 25 kg/m2. The increase in mortality, however, tends to be modest until a BMI of 30 kg/m2 is reached. For persons with a BMI 30 kg/m2, mortality rates from all causes, and especially from cardiovascular disease, are generally increased by 50 to 100 percent above that of persons with BMIs in the range of 20 to 25 kg/m2.

The effects of substance abuse are cumulative, significantly contributing to costly social, physical, mental, and public health problems. These problems include: Teenage pregnancy Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) Other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Domestic violence Child abuse Motor vehicle crashes Physical fights Crime Homicide Suicide Substance abuse refers to a s et of related conditions associated with the consumption of mind - and behavior - altering subs tances that have negative behavioral and health outcomes. Social attitudes and political and legal responses to the consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs make su bstance abuse one of the most complex public health issues. In addition to the considerable health implications, substance abuse has been a flash - point in the criminal justice system and a major focal point in discussions about social values: people argue over whether substance abuse is a disease with genetic and biological foundations or a matte r of personal choice. Advances in research have led to the development of evidence -based strategies to effectively address substance abuse. Improvements in brain -imaging technologies and the development of medications that assist in treatment have gradual ly shifted the research community's perspective on substance abuse. There is now a deeper understanding of substance abuse as a disorder that develops in adolescenc e and, for some individuals, will develop into a chronic illness that will require lifelong monitoring and care. Improved evaluation of community -level prevention has enhanced researchers' understanding of environmental and social factors that contribute t o the initiation and abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs, leading to a more sophisticated und erstanding of how to implement evidence -based strategies in specific social and cultural settings. A stronger emphasis on evaluation has expanded evidence -based pra ctices for drug and alcohol treatment. Improvements have focused on the development of bette r clinical interventions through research and increasing the skills and qualifications of treatment providers.

People who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk of disease and premature death. Bene fits are greater for people who stop at ear lier ages, but quitting tobacco use is beneficial at any age. Many factors influence tobacco use, disease, and mortality. Risk factors include race/ethnicity, age, education, and socioeconomic status. Significant disparities in tobacco use exist geographi cally; such disparities typically result from differences among states in smoke -free protections, tobacco prices, and program funding for tobacco prevention. Healthy People 2020 (www.healthypeople.gov) Smoking Cessation Attempts One-half ( 50.7%) of regu lar smokers went without smoking for one day or longer in the past year because they were trying to quit smoking.

It impacts: overall physical, social, and mental health status; prev ention of disease and disability; detection and treatment of health conditions; quality of life; preventable death; and life expectancy.

People with a usual source of care have better health outcomes and fewer disparities and costs. Having a primary care provider (PCP) as the usual source of care is especial ly important. PCPs can develop meaningful and sustained relationships with patients and provide integrated service s while practicing in the context of family and community. Having a usual PCP is associated with: Greater patient trust in the provider Good p atient -provider communication Increased likelihood that patients will receive appropriate care Improving health ca re services includes increasing access to and use of evidence -based preventive services. Clinical preventive services are services that: preve nt illness by detecting early warning signs or symptoms before they develop into a disease (primary prevention); o r detect a disease at an earlier, and often more treatable, stage (secondary prevention).

Good oral health improves a person's ability to speak, smile, smell, taste, touch, chew, swallow, and make facial expressions to show feelings and emotions. However, oral diseases, from cavities to oral cancer, cause pain and disability for many Americans. Good self -care, such as brushing with fluoride toothpaste, daily flos sing, and professi onal treatment, is key to good oral health. Health behaviors that can lead to poor oral health include: tobacco use; excessive alcohol use; and poor dietary choices . The significant improvement in the oral health of Americans over the pa st 50 years is a p ublic health success story. Most of the gains are a result of effective prevention and treatment efforts. One major success is community water fluoridation, which now benefits about 7 out of 10 Americans who get water through public water systems. However, some Americans do not have access to preventive programs. People who have the least access to preventive services and dental treatment have greater rates of oral diseases. A person's ability to access oral healthcare is associated with f actors such as edu cation level, income, race, and ethnicity. Barriers that can limit a person's use of preventive interventions and treatments include: limited access to and availability of dental services; lack of awareness of the need for care; cost; an d fear of dental p rocedures. There are also social determinants that affect oral health. In general, people with lower levels of education and income, and people from specific racial/ethnic groups, have higher rates of disease. People with disabilities and other health con ditions, like diabetes, are more likely to have poor oral health. Potential strategies to address these issues include: Implementing and evaluating activities that have an impact on health behavior. Promoting interventions to reduce toot h decay, such as d ental sealants and fluoride use. Evaluating and improving methods of monitoring oral diseases and conditions. Increasing the capacity of State dental health programs to provide preventive oral health services. Increasing the number of community health cent ers with an oral health component.

Lack of education. - Public Health Representative, Pottawattamie Coun ty Many families on well water throughout the county, fluoride treatment at an early age is lacking .

And, they end up in the Emergency Room with pain . Some then stop eating healthy food because of bite issues. - Social Services Provider, Douglas County Access and affordability. - Social Services Provider, Douglas County Lack of Providers Lack of dental professionals in close proximity to those in need. - Community Leader, Douglas County Lack of dentists in North and South Omaha, lower prior ity when insurance is not available and/or nee d to pay for basic necessities first such as rent and utilities. - Social Services Provider, Douglas County Health Awareness/Education Parent education about dental care of young children but also limited acces s to dentists. - Physician, Douglas County Healthcare Information & Resources COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 293 Perceptions of Local Healthcare Services Over 7 in 10 Metro Area adults ( 72.9%) rate the overall healthcare services available in their community as \"excellent\" or \"very goo d.\" Another 20.6% gave \"good\" ratings.

Health status and related -health behaviors are determined by influences at multiple l evels: personal, organizational/institutional, environmental, and policy. Because significant and dynamic interrelationships exist among these different levels of health d eterminants, educational and community -based programs are most likely to succeed in i mproving health and wellness when they address influences at all levels and in a variety of environments/settings. Education and community -based programs and strategies a re designed to reach people outside of traditional healthcare settings. These setting s may include schools, worksites, healthcare facilities, and/or communities. Using nontraditional settings can help encourage informal information sharing within communit ies through peer social interaction. Reaching out to people in different settings als o allows for greater tailoring of health information and education. Educational and community -based programs encourage and enhance health and wellness by educating communi ties on topics such as: chronic diseases; injury and violence prevention; mental ill oral health; tobacco use; substance abuse; nutrition; and obesity prevention.

Through a five -method approach: 1.) Each program will be evaluated by one of the following types of evaluations: Short -term - These are immediate, observable effects of the program, such as changes in knowledge, attitudes or skills. For example, in a diabetes management program, participants could be assessed to see if they learned more about their condition a nd whether they be lieved they could prevent complications. Intermediate - These are changes in risk factors or behaviors. For example, in a diabetes management program, participants could report on whether they were eating more fruits and vegetables or have had a recent eye exam. Changes in blood glucose and body mass index would also be examples of intermediate results. Long -term - These results tie back to the ultimate goals of the program, such as decreased morbidity or mortality, fewer complications , increased access and decreased health costs related to diabetes or improved attendance at work or school. 2.)

Finance Department Oversees this Category. Financial assistance is free or discounted health services provided to persons who cannot afford to pay and who meet the eligibility criteria of the organization's financial assistance pol icy. Financial assistance is reported in terms of costs, not charges. Financial assistance does not include bad debt, which may be reported in Part III of the IRS Form 990, Schedule H for Hospitals (Schedule H) but not as community benefit. Count: Free and partially discounted care (discounted from cost, not charges). Expenses incurred by the provision of financial assistance. Provider taxes, assessments or fees if Medicaid DSH funds in your state are used in whole or in part to offset the cost of fi nancial assistance. Unpaid co -pays for Medicaid and other low -income patients can be reported as financial assistance if so specified in the organization's financial assistance policy. Patients in these circumstances are referred to as \"underinsured.\" Do not count: Bad debt. OR Discounts provided to self -pay patients who do not qualify for financial assistance. Contractual allowances or quick -pay discounts. Category 2 : Government -Sponsored Means -Tested Health Care - *Evaluation s will be done through monitoring and auditing current programs covered. Finance Department Oversees this Category. Government -sponsored means -tested health care community benefit includes unpaid costs of public programs for low -income persons - the shortfall created when a faci lity receives payments that are less than the cost of caring for public program beneficiaries. This payment shortfall is not the same as a contractual allowance, which is the full difference between charges and government payments. Count: Revenues and cost s related to: Medicaid. Other means -tested government programs, including: State Children's Health Insurance Programs (SCHIP) and State and local indigent care: Medical programs for low -income or medically indigent persons not eligible for Medicaid. Do not count: Medicare shortfall (this can be included in other financial reports but not as a community benefit). Other government programs that are not means -tested, such as VA and Indian Health Service. Methodist Health System Process for Community Benefits Evaluation s 7/13/18 P a g e | 9 The Third Category is measured through our Lyon Software's Community Benefit Inventory for Social Accountability ( CBISA ). Category 3 : Community Benefits Services - *Evaluation s will be done by those performing the program and reviewed by the Community Benefit Administration ongoing. As a general ru le: Count: Programs that respond to an identified community health need and are designed to accomplish one or more community benefit objectives. Programs and activities directed to or including at -risk persons, such as underinsured and uninsured persons. Programs offered to the broad community (including at -risk persons) designed to improve community health. Do not count: Programs primarily designed for marketing or promotion purposes.

Community -Based Clinical Services These are health services and screenings provided on a one -time basis or as a special event in the community. They do not include permanent subsidized hospital outpatient services; report these in Hospital Outpatient Services, C3. As with other categories of community benefit, these p rograms and activities should be counted only if they are designed to meet identified community health needs. Screenings - Screenings are health tests conducted in the community as a public service, such as blood pressure measurements, cholesterol checks, and school physicals. They are a secondary prevention activity designed to detect the early onset of illness and disease and can result in a referral to any community m edical resource. To be considered community benefit, screenings should provide follow -up care as needed, including assistance for persons who are uninsured and underinsured. Count if the program addresses a community need and meets a community benefit objective: Behavioral health screenings. Blood pressure screening. Lipid profile and/or cholesterol screening. Eye examinations. Gener al screening programs. Health -risk appraisals. Hearing screenings. Mammography screenings. Prostate screenings. Osteoporosis screenings. School and sports physical examinations (only if there is a demonstrated need for vulnerable populations). Skin cancer screenings. Stroke risk screenings. One -time or occasionally held clinics - Count if the program addresses a community need and meets a community benefit objective: Blood pressure and/or lipid profile/cholesterol screening clinics. Cardiology risk factor s creening clinics (take care not to include if screening is really marketing or case -finding). Colon cancer screenings. Dental care clinics. Immunization clinics. Mobile units that deliver primary care to underserved populations on an occasional or one -time basis. One-time or occasionally held primary care clinics. School physical clinics to increase access to health care for vulnerable populations. Clinics for underinsured and uninsured persons - These programs, which in the past may have been called \"free clinics,\" provide free or low -cost health care to medically underinsured and uninsured persons through the use of volunteers, including physicians and health care professional s, who donate their time. Count if the program addresses a community need and mee ts a community benefit objective: Costs for staff time, equipment, and overhead costs. Lab and medication costs.

Subsidized Health Services Subsidized health services are clinical programs that are provided despite a financial loss so significant that negative margins remain after removing the effects of financial assistance, bad debt and Medicaid shortfalls. Nevertheless, the service is provided because it meets an identified community need and if no longer offered, it would either be unavailable in the area or fall to the re sponsibility of government or another tax -exempt organization to provide. Subsidized services do not include ancillary services that support service lines, such as lab and radiology (if these services are provided to persons meeting the hospital's financia l assistance eligibility criteria, they should be reported as financial assistance). CAREFULLY EXAMINE SUBSIDIZED SERVICES -- The category of subsidized services is not a catch -all category for services that operate at a loss. Care needs to be taken to ascertain whether the service satisfies all criteria for being included as a subsidized health service that provides community benefit. Exclude from subsidized health services amounts that already have been accounted for, such as financial assistance or Me dicaid losses. In addition, the IRS in instructions for the Schedule H require excluding the shortfall from bad debt. Count: Clinical programs or service lines that the organization subsidizes. The amount the health care organization subsidizes to provid e these services. Report the amount of the subsidy for the whole program, not just for components of the program that are losing money. For example, if a component of the emergency room service, such as physician services, is losing money but the overall s ervice is not losing money and does not need to be subsidized, then the service would not be reported as a subsidized service.
