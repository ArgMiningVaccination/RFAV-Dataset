We're combining our educational, clinical care, and research arms to fulfill our institutional mission: to further the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ to make man whole . With our community partners , this took on new meaning in 2020 with the impact of Covid -19 in how we worked with our partners to improve the health and wellness of people in our region to support everyone in health and well -being, truly publi c health, in FY 2020. At LLUH, our focus on wholeness, health priorities, and the social determinants of health ensures our system is meeting the needs of our community as we invest in the health of tomorrow. The LLUH Community Benefit Objectives managed by the Institute for Community Partnerships on behalf of LLUH's four licensed hospitals , the implementation of the first year of the Community Health Implementation Strategy 2020 -2022 (CHIS) to address the priority areas identified in the 2019 Community Hea lth Needs Assessment (CHNA). This report features the work done by LLUH & our partners in: Workforce development & education ; Access to green spaces and organic food to foster community engagement; Reduction of isolation and access to mental health resou rces for vulnerable populations ; Reduction of the burden of lifestyle diseases that unduly impact lower income populations; Access to the essentials, particularly food in 2020, as a poverty alleviation & reduction strategy. To Our Valued San Bernardino & Riverside Community Members, There is no question that 2020 has been a year like none other. As we reflect on the challenges we've faced, not only as a nation but in our region with infection rates of Covid -19 at all -time highs, we understand the deeper meaning of what it means to be of benefit to our community and the impact during an unusual time. N o one could have predicted how the pandemic and social movements would change our awareness, our thinking, and our lives individually and coll ectively. And yet, through the difficulties, the isolation, the mask wearing and hand washing , and the worry of this past year, we here at Loma Linda University Health believe that at the end of 2020, there is hope for the future ahead : Vaccines are being distributed and every day, our hospital and clinical staff carry on with courage in care of our patients, those here for routine and emergency care, day -after- day to provide excellent, compassionate care. The courage of health providers in the face of risk and exhaustion is why many answer the call to be in the health and healing profession s. \"Love thy neighbor\", as Christ showed us, is why the women and men of this institution believe in their work in making all people healthy and whole. And we have great hope because of our partners who work alongside our Loma Linda University Health to achieve the same mission beyond the borders of our health campus. 2020 provided our broader community network the chance to strengthen and tie together through our Community Hea lth Implementation Strategy (CHIS 2020 -2022) some unique and new focus areas. While we were able to maintain the larger strategic implementation plan, we found new ways of creating an ever -increasing, stronger safety net of community partners to support ou r community in the face of increased unemployment and decreased access to the essentials . Never before has staying relevant and in -step with the need s of our community been so evident than in the responsiveness and impact LLUH and our community partners ha ve in creating the safety net for members of our community who experience an undue burde n of the pandemic and economic instability. Our investments in workforce development and education and in community -health building through our Community Health Workers, community garden and food security investments, and focus on the social determinants of health on lower -income families, the story of these efforts in 2020, is one of hope and optimism for the power of community. R ichard Hart, MD, DrPH Kerry Heinrich, JD President Chie f Executive Officer Loma Linda University Health Loma Linda University Medical Center LLUH's Commitment to Equity Listen, Respect , and Engage are t hree powerful words that encompass the LLUH's intentions towards equit y in our communities. Loma Linda University's Institute for Community Partnership's (ICP) mission is to ensure that LLUH is both relevant and responsive to the needs of our community. The COVID pandemic has introduced unprecedented difficulties in which marginalized and \" minoritized\" communities are disproportionally affected. Unfortunately, during the last year, we also experienced the continued and senseless killings of our Black brothers and sisters. This loss of Black lives occur within the context of a history rooted in institutional prejudice, systemic discrimination, and hostility. For the Black community, this is an inter- generational reality and a burden that Black families, parents, and children and people of color have had to carry. I t has left many in our community weakened, discouraged, angry, anxious, and struggling to cope with a collective physical and psychological burden. And now with the urgency of vaccinations due to Covid -19, additional work must be done in our communities to build trust in communities of color to heal mistrust and to build trust to help gain access to the vaccine to the communities that have been disproportionately impacted by the virus. At LLUH , we are joining with our community partners to facilitate and support conversations that will allow us to listen, respect, and engage in active ways that lead to healing and systemic change. LLUH is committed to L isten: I am honored , along with Dr. Hart and Mr. Heinrich, to be part of a health system that is inviting and listening to the experience of our brothers and sisters of color, to the stories of our employees and students who have faced difficulties and discrimination. In the year ahead, our Institute will be producing a \"listening\" podcast project to lift up the voices and stories of people in the community and we will focus some of our ongoing community health needs assessment activities on listening to those with lived expe rience. L LUH is committed to Respect : We create respect for what is shared by acting on the feedback for how we can improve our health system and, in the work we do with our partners and the community to improve health and well- being of our communities and we will thoughtfully learn and take action. . L LUH is committed to Engage: We will work with our partners and with the community members together to implement solutions so our community work is partner -driven and community -member involved. O nly through increased equity can we create wholeness in individuals and communities and at LLUH, we are committed to equity as a social determinant of health. Ju an Carlos Belliard, PhD, MPH Assistant Vice President LLUH - Institute for Community Partnerships LLUH's Covid- 19 Response in FY 20 With the unexpected onset of Coivd -19 and a global pandemic, LLUH has been impacted like many hospitals that put the safety of patients first by preparing to take care of a surge of intensive care patients. LLUH cancelled elective surgeries and procedures in the s pring of 2020 to support California's \"Stay at Home \" orders. In our region, the surge of patients did not hit our county until July of 2020 and now again in November and December of 2020 (at the time of the writing of this report) the hospital, like all other hospitals in Southern California, is at zero cap acity for ICU beds with the Los Angeles Times declaring in a news article on December 17th, 2020, \"ICU availability in Southern California at 0%, and it's going to get worse, officials warn.\" LLUH and our regional hospital peers are facing an unprecedented and unimaginable, regional challenge: a regional 0% capacity of critical care beds across the entirety of Southern California. While our health system has been preparing, the courage and commitment of our health care providers to fulfill our primary missi on to take care of critically ill patients is heroic. Our teams at LLUH are working tirelessly, making the mission of caring for patients more real and more vital than it has ever been . 2020 was also a year of hope: LLUH and our Community Partners mounted a community safety -net response and with our partners, we created a community garden in the heart of San Bernardino during a pandemic year as the ultimate symbol of resiliency and the belief in the future . We conducted food box deliveries, provided tutoring online educational support for students, and worked with Loma L inda University's School of Public Health to create validated health literature in multiple languages to increase access to factual, public health advisories. This report is the story of 2020 and LLUH's relevance and responsiveness in both our inpatient, o utpatient, and community settings. All the programs in this report served community members in-person prior to the March 2020 restrictions or, continued outreach and converted their operations to virtual outreach . While our total number of people served by community benefit programs reduced to about a third of that in a typical year (120,000 in FY 2019) , the value and impact of these critical services to over 30,000 people in FY 20 is detailed here as a testimony to the resiliency of our region.

One Community Benefit Implementation Mission. LLUH has a unique, best -practice model in the implementation of community benefit in order to achieve collective impact with their investment and program strategy: Since 2006, all licensed hospitals within the LLUH system have centralized their community benefit investments through the Institute for Community Partnerships to more strategically align and implement community health investments and since the beginning, LLUH has reported programmatically at the health system level to maximize outcomes . The community benefit numbers are reported financially and independently on each licensed hospital's 990 Schedule H based on their indi vidual hospital financials with attentive management to both the collective and individual program s, activities, and outcomes reported in the annual s ystem community benefit report , in compliance with the ACA (2010) and California's AB 204 (2019). The centralized model allows the hospitals to accomplish more impact in the community from the Community Health Implementation Strategy (CHIS) and in more effectively working with partner organizations with similar goals. LLUH Community Benefit: Centralized, Coordinated, Collect Impact by Design , Outcomes- Driven LLUH's Hospitals: Collective Impact Institute for Community Partnerships The Institute for Community Partnerships is committed to supporting implementation of LLUH's hospital community benefit investments and fulfillment of the priority focus areas , in close collaboration with the community, to community -based research, and to service- learning at Loma Linda University Health (LLUH). The Institute plays a centralizing, coordinating, and i mplementation function for the four licensed hospitals at LLUH's community benefit investment dollars. Our institute is committed to strategically working with our community partners to better understand and address the needs of the community through activ ities such as research, teaching, and service -based learning. Community participation is at the core of our efforts, with structured learning opportunities for underrepresented minority students, training programs for community health workers, and communi ty research projects. The Institute for Community Partnerships: Seeks to work \"with\" the community rather than \"in\" the community. Strives to better understand and address the needs of the community, while recognizing and capitalizing on its assets. Seeks to integrate services from research to teaching through community -based participation and service -based learning. Provides a supporting and coordinating role across the various schools and the Medical Center. Our Community Benefit Objectives include : Improving access to health services. Enhancing the role of public health in health care services. Serving those who live in poverty or other vulnerable populations. Promoting and enhancing community building activities. Committing to community health imp rovement throughout the organization. Many Strengths, One Mission Mission Vision Values To ensure Loma Linda University Health is relevant and responsive to our community. To be the primary portal for community engagement between Loma Linda University Health and our local community. Collaboration, Respect, Equity, Compassion, Excellence Listen. Engage. Respect. About the Community We Serve Loma Linda University Health's primary service area can be defined, broadly, as California's San Bernardino, Riverside, and Ontario metropolitan areas. San Bernardino and Riverside counties make up the geographic area historically named \"the Inland Empire\" due to the region's rich diversity of native peoples and agricultural history. The region totals 27,000 square miles and is situated approximately 60 miles east from the Los Angeles metropolitan area and the Pacific Ocean, the Inland Empire is home to a quickly growing population over 4. 6 million people and is the 3rd most populous metropolitan area in the State of California and the 13th most populous metropolitan area in the United States. The two counties are home to some of the most diverse people in C alifornia, with Hispanic populations now representing the majority of the population. San Bernardino and Riverside County Health Rankings Published online at countyhealthrankings.org, the rankings help counties understand what influences the health of r esidents and average lifespans by geographic region. The rankings are unique in their ability to measure the current overall health of nearly every county in all 50 states. They also look at a variety of measures that affect the future health of communitie s, such as high school graduation rates, access to healthy foods, rates of smoking, obesity and teen births. LLUH's goal is to bring people together to look at the many factors that influence health and opportunities to reduce health gaps. For programs and interventions to have a lasting impact, they must focus on strategies that improve health from a population standpoint. For LLUH, we are strategically positioned in two counties that together, face significant economic challenges. San Bernardino ranks 41st out of 58 counties in California in terms of health factors while Riverside ranks 35th. Despite the challenge, LLUH believes that our community is resilient and with our community partners, we are addressing poverty through workforce development and heal th & wellness. COVID -19 Impact With a total of 249,000 confirmed cases as of the time of this report, and over 2,800 deaths due to COVID -19 across San Bernardino and Riverside counties, the pandemic has a greatly impacted those living in the region, with some of the biggest challenges being food insecurity, unemployment, housing burden, and social isolati on. As a result of the pandemic, the number of food insecure households has risen considerably, with local food banks more than doubling the amount of their food distributions. The most greatly impacted by the lack of access to food has been minority popul ations and families with children. Unemployment in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties reached a peak of 15% leaving 300,000 people without work, a significant increase from the previous, pre-pandemic rate of 4%. However, unemployment rates in the region have since been recovering slowly but steadily (as of October 2020, the unemployment rate is at 9%). Less income, combined with an already expensive housing market that has rent prices rising at a faster rate than other Southern California counties, has i ncreased the housing burden on many households in the region. Additionally, isolation, which had already been identified as a great need of our community before the spread of COVID -19, has become even more of a challenge due to physical distancing measures and a lack of access to technology. To read the extended community needs and assets profile, visit our 2019 CHNA: https://lluh.org/about -us/community -benefit/reports -and-resources Service Region of LLUH Hospitals As the regional academic, quaternary, and specialty care provider, LLUH service region covers almost one quarter of the geographic landmass of the state of California , especially when accounting for the service region of Children's Hospital into Inyo and M ono Counties. In addition to the 4.6 million residents of these two counties, it is estimated due to seasonal agricultural work that there are estimated to be 296,000 immigrants who are undocumented in our two counties, with LLUH as the regional safety -net provider for all people. In 2019, LLUH hospitals treated 53,455 people in our hospitals, with 1.8 million people in the outpatient system with 135,603 of those outpat ient visits to our Emergency Departments as a Level 1 Trauma center. 1 in 3 People who visit LLUH's hospitals are insured by Medi -Cal making LLUH an essential safety -net provider offering the most specialized and advanced medical care to people of our region. LLUH Community Benefit Strategy Community Benefit is reported according to four major categories and broken into different types of activities that are reported in each hospital' s 990, Schedule H. For more information on each category, see the appendix. Community Health Benefit investment dollars are reported programmatically, by priority area and outcomes, in fulfillment of LLUH's current imple mentation strategy. All dollars are carefully accounted for and reported according to the appropriate fiscal year in hospital 990 Schedule H , though programs and outcomes reporting may span multiple years. The Community Health Benefit Strategy This is a high -level summary of the 2019 CHNA priorities that the 2020 -2022 implementation strategy is based on and what that guides LLUH's community investments and program implementations. To read the full & CHIS reports, https://lluh.org/about -us/community -benefit/reports -and-resources Targeting the Social Determinants of Health The focus areas guide our Social Determinant of Health Targets for program design and implementations. The social determinant targets help ICP design interventions or invest in partner interventions on behalf of priority populations . While our community investments are primarily focused on Workforce Development & Educ ation and Health & Wellness, the hospitals ' collective impact in working across the social determinants is eviden t by our programs and services and screening for SDOH risk and increased system responsiveness to demonstrated needs is in the pilot and demonstration phase for specific children and adult populations at LLUH.

Community Benefit Implementation FY 20 Special Implementation: Covid- 19 Respons e Food Security Response - Food Box Delivery Program With the onset of the pandemic and unexpected changes in 2020, LLUH along with the support of our partners , was able to maintain our implementation plan for community benefit o n behalf of the hospitals. In addition to maintaining our routine opera tions, LLUH ICP and community partners adopted additional implementation objectives to strengthen our relevance and responsiveness to our community this year. The Community S afety -net Response to Covid -19 Expanded partnerships and outreach with Feeding America food banks in our two- county region: LLUH -ICP provided coordinated distribution and volunteer labor in partne rship with Community Action Partnership of San Bernardino (CAPSBC) to deliver food boxes and community investment dollars to FIND Food Bank in the Coachella Valley to reach lower -income, isolated, and disenfranchised or disconnected communities in order to increase food security in t he region. Prior to the pandemic, feeding America estimated 1 -in-10 people in San Bernardino County we re food insecure. That estimate is now 1 -in-6 people in San Bernardino County will be food insecure by the end of 2020.1 CAPSBC served over 120,000 individuals in calendar year 2019 that include the distribution of 12.7 million pounds of food valued at $21.2 million dollars2. The total food distribution in 2020 for CAPSBC is expected to far exceed previous years as they have been coordinating the distribution of 1,000 food boxes weekly in the community, with LLUH -ICP coordinating 100 -200 of those boxes f or delivery to local families. Since the start of the pandemic, FIND Food Bank went from serving 90,000 people a month to 190,000 people a month: this is more double in the demand for food. FIND Food Bank estimates now that 1 in 5 people in the Coachella desert region of Riverside County are now food insecure .3 1 \"Community Organizations to provide food to over 1,000 families,\" Highland Community News. July 30, 2020. 2 Agency Website: 3 FIND Food Bank's website: https://www.findfoodbank.org/finds -covid -response/ LLUH Community Care Corps Responding to Outreach & Health Information Needs of Disenfranchised Communities Community Care Corps is a collaboration that started with a focus on COVID -19 that brought together three partners: School of Public Health, I nstitute for Community Partnerships, and School of Behavioral Health. Teams met weekly to discuss how best to deliver relevant and respo nsive messaging regarding community issues to the areas of San Bernardino County and Riverside County, with a focus on San Bernardino City. Initially divided into an information gathering or Development team, and a message Dissemination team - students an d staff found that messaging took a long time to develop and get back to the community. Additionally, students found they wanted more information on local resources that were currently available. Therefore, some of the student group focused on gathering and mapping resources in the area and the others focused on picking individual topics to both research and then create flyers, graphics, and info graphs . Currently, there are 4 volunteer students and 3 staff collaborating with multiple partners to focus o n feedback from the community on relevant issues. Messaging is delive red in both English and Spanish via food box deliveries, websites, text messaging, and social media through ag encies and community partners. Community Care Corps represents six LLUH staff providing over 200 hours of work to create materials and engagement of 20 future health professions graduate students who contributed over 450 hours of time to design, translate and circulate materials. The primary objectives of Community C are Corps are to eliminate health literacy and/or acces s to information and technology disparities and to get verified and validated health information out to communities of color to dispel rumors about Covid -19 and build trust in recommended prevention . Community Care Corps resources are free and available to the community: https://sites.google.com/llu.edu/community- care -corps/home Support to African American Churches - COVID Testing Sites As part of the regional response to address the disparity in the burden on black and African American communities, ICP partnered with the Inland Empire Concerned African American Churches to set -up COVID testing site s as way to engage and reach more members of the black community and provide access to COVID testing. ICP invested in the partial cost of purchasing the non- touch thermometers for volunteers to use in screening participants. IECAAC also coordinated multip le community events to help increase access to people of color in the region. Reverend Samuel Casey , of the New Life Christian Church and the Executive Director of COPE (Congregations Organized for Prophetic Engagement, was quoted in the Fontana Herald New s article, \"African American faith leaders coordinate coronavirus testing event on June 12,\" June 8, 2020) stated : \"The stark racial disparities in COVID -19 cases and death rates is a call for extra caution and safety. Before churches 're -gather,' African American churches will serve as testing sites for COVID -19 to promote the health of our communities and their congr egants,\" said Rev. Casey. Building Community Trust in the Vaccine To address the concerns of Black and Hispanic community members and increase confidence and trust in the vaccine , ICP and partners are holding virtual vaccine information sessions with a Lo ma Linda Health Providers and public health faculty and scientists in order to provide outreach, education, and access to a physician for question and answer. From the two virtual outreach sessions held so far, over 275 community members have received access the provider sessions to answer questions and over 2,500 views on Facebook Live as recordings have circulated. More seminars are intended throughout 2021. How the LLUH Covid -19 Response is supported by hospital's Community Benefit dollars The hospitals ' investment in the operational costs of ICP provided the staff time to support LLUH's overall community and public health responsiveness in the community during Covid- 19 to accomplish: Coordination of the food distribution program with partners. LLUH system -employed Community Health Workers made phone calls to families and delivered hundreds of food boxes when diverted from inpatient and clinical areas during Stay at Home periods. Community Care Corps to manage, design, and distribute outreach materials. In Fiscal Year 2020, ICP added the implementation of our Covid- 19 rapid responsiveness by deploying the CHW teams to support the effort to deliver food to known families in the reg ion with high SDOH risk factors before Covid- 19 and through CHW outreach, was able to maintain the relationship with over 800 families to ensure food security and support the local food bank effort to change the delivery system in order to accommodate Stay at Home. ICP also provided technical assistance in support of our partners in the work to address the immediate concerns of lower -income or disenfranchised community members . Partners of the corps circulate d the critical public health messaging in these communities from credible sources, by partnering with the Loma Linda University School of Public Health to ensure that information was vetted for local partner distribution. This involved translating materials into Spanish and working to put flyers in food bank boxes as well email and social media ads for partners to use in their communication chains. In summary, LLUH hospitals provided, through their existing investments in the Institute, the staffing to work as part of the emergency responsiveness in th e community allowing our health system response to be relevant, responsive, coordinated, and part of the network of community -based organizations reaching out to the community. Workforce Development & Pipeline to Higher Education LLUH's primary focus area s for the 2020 -2022 CHIS Cycle are initiatives related to workforce development and education in order to make an impact, over the long -term, in alleviating poverty in our region. Jobs and education are a primary in vestment area of the hospitals in order to work with partners who are providing access to traditionally under -represented, under -served, and often under -estimated youth and young adults who are low -income and/or people of color. In FY 20, LLUH ICP worked with three partners to expand the outreach to middle & high -school youth in order to bridge them to workforce education, entry, and bridge scholarship. Partners shifted outreach to virtual meetings to keep students focused on thinking about their future . Community- Academic Partners in Service (CAPS) The pipeline programs operated by the Institute for Community Partnerships ' are housed in the Community -Academic Partners in Service program and intended to provide disadvantaged youth exposure and access to exe rcise, healthy lifestyle education, and career options in health care in order to increase access to education, as part of the community benefit investments made by the LLUH hospitals. The primary goal of the Pipeline program over the 2020 -2022 funding cy cle is to bring more community organizations doing similar work together to strengthen the regional response and res ources available to our youth. Investing in the Youth of San Bernardino and Riverside is the long -term strategy to shift the needle on poverty in our region. The pipeline program activities are funded by hospital community benefit: o My Campus - quarterly outreach with health professionals to introduce students to health professions. o Discovery Program - A three -week summer intensive where students learn about health careers, o Robotic Surgery Simulation Event o Pipeline Alumni Association Other wellness and health interventions implemented through CAPS include: o Tutoring and school -based support services (online in FY 20) o Family resource center , La Escuelita at a local school (and online) o Goal 4 Health , a soccer league for underserved youth to increase access to safe green spaces, recreation, and safe play (suspended in FY 20 due to Covid -19). What do we mean by Pipeline Programs? LLUH has been building a pipeline to higher education to connect local minority and under -served youth to health careers as an access, equity, and inclusion strategy. This is in alignment with mission of service and participation in the local community through the Institute for Community Partnership's CAPS program and hospital community b enefit investment strategy and implementation with community and other regional partners. Oversight of Jardin de Salud & Garden Rx programs The CAPS program as part of ICP also oversees the implementation and work with Huerta del Valle in the Jardin de Salud , as well as the family engagement and coordination with the garden and coordination of service learning by engaging graduate of LLU into community service . Thanks to the CAPS and Huerta del Valle implementation, over thirty families established garden plots in FY 20 with future implementations. Additionally, the CAPS te am assisted Huerta del Valle in weekly distributing 100 boxes of organic produce to community members at the new and developing site to help with food security and access to health food during Covid- 19. More on the Jardin de Salud is covered in the follow ing sections of this report , as well as the FY 21 growth of the Produce Rx program with SAC Health System. For more information, visit: https://caps.llu.edu/ Because of the CAPS & Huerta del Valle teams, over 30 families are now growing organic produce in the heart of San Bernardino City, with room to grow to a total of 52 family plots! Making Hope Happen Foundation San Bernardino City Unified School District LLUH has made a sustained investment in Making Hope Happen, a bridge scholarship program that provides San Bernardino students a bridge scholarship of $3,000 to 20 students, as well as a stipend for a mentor. The graduating seniors who will become freshmen are paired with a past recipient in order to have an older undergraduate student who understand the unique challenges many first - and- second generation college students face in bridging to higher education. Pipeline Graduate Access Scholarships In FY 20, LLUH -ICP established access scholarships with two of the schools in the LLU system to open access to higher education for under -served youth and students of color who have traditionally lacked access to graduate education in the health professions, a lifelong game -changer for local residents who come from low income earning families in the region. The requirements of the scholarships were the schools had to match the community benefit investment in order amplify the impact on the most number of students who met criteria possible. Over the current CHIS cycle, ICP will enga ge more partners in working to open access scholarships as part of the long -term commitment to growing the healthcare workforce of tomorrow with local students who understand the community and show an interest in continuing to work in this region in an effort to uplift families and make generational changes and reduce the impact of poverty in our region. A Letter of Gratitude from a FY20 Scholarship Recipient: \"I am a first generation college graduate, and further pursuing my second degree. Belonging to a low income family has posed its struggles, however thanks to this amazing scholarship which I was gifted I am furthermore encouraged to finish my education without the added stress of paying for a big portion of it. I was in utter stress, yet today I stand with relief that somehow I was chosen to be a recipient of this scholarship. This gift has lifted a weight off of my shoulders that I did not perceive would be resolved without a consequence of my grades being affected. Now I can focus directly on performing well in my coursework, to be the best nurse that I can be.\" Investing in Health Professional Education Workforce Development at San Manuel Gateway College In 2016, thanks to a seed investment made by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, the LLUH system was able to build and establish a technical and vocational training college , the San Manuel Gateway College (SMGC) , in the heart of San Bernardino. The college is co-located with the SAC Health System to provide a community -setting for the training of future healthcare workers. As Loma Linda University (LLU) is a graduate medical education campus with over eight gradua te schools, the health system recently committed a year -over -year investment to support SMGC operations and extend access to community members seeking access to vocational and technical training in order to strengthen the pipeline to education in the regio n. SMGC students also rotate through LLUH's many clinical settings for training during their programs. In FY 20, Loma Linda University Medical Center invested $1.5 million in SMGC to support health professional education operational costs and training as an access strategy to address workforce development and education needs of local youth. The SMGC Student Population proudly represents: Students of Color First Generation students or \"first few in their family \" to attend post - secondary e ducation Residents of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties Over 50% receive financial aid or scholarships to attend SMGC. Students are p rovided support from the SMGC staff and faculty given the challenges and life experiences many of the SMGC students face regarding risk factors related to the social determinants of health. Every year, the SMGC graduates are included in the annual graduation ceremonies and celebr ations at Loma Lin da University to honor th eir success and accomplishment and association with a health care system and institution of higher education. For more about SMGC visit the website at : http s://sanmanuelgatewaycollege.llu.edu/ The Goal of SMGC SMGC provides local youth and adults from San Bernardino and the surrounding areas access to professional training and certification as a workforce development strategy. In 2020, SMGC provided the following technical training programs and certifications: o Certified Nursing Assistant o Medical Assistant o Promotores Academy (Community Health Worker Basic Certification ; and certifications for specialization as Community Health Education Workers or Cl inical Community Health Workers) o Pharmacy Tech o Surgical Tech SMGC is developing the health care workforce of tomorrow while providing the bridge to help our community's youth and ad ults find a path to higher education to set them on a life -long path of career development and economic advancement. How the LLUH hospital's Community Benefit dollars support Workforce Development & Education In FY 20, ICP began to engage more partners in the regional pipeline to support, align and engage in collective impact on the part of the regional partners in effort to align to the local School District and County's similar efforts in workforce development and educ ation . While CAPS also includes oversight of the service learning and coordination of Loma Linda University student volunteers, only the cost of operations and CAPS programs that are funded by the hospitals are reported as community benefit . In Fiscal Year 2020, the hospit als invested the following in workforce development and education efforts in the community: $70,000 in access schola rships to high school students; $60,000 to pipeline programs, including scholarships to high school students bridging to undergraduate school; $15,000 access scholarships dollars in Public Health; and $15,000 access scholarship dollars in Nursing . The LLUH partners awarded scholarships to over 50 students bridging to education. In Fiscal Y ear 2021, ICP is working to invest workforce development and education dollars in partners in the Murrieta/Temecula region, and to partner with Health Career Connections to increase access to health care sector workplace internships for students of color. The hospitals report dollars invested in Health Professions Education for the training of medical professionals above and beyond our federal or state subsidies and grants, or indirect or direct medical education dollar s received. LLUH provides operationa l support to San Manue l Gateway College as part of the commitment to susta in the operations of this critical workforce access strategy. Community Health Worker (CHW) Workforce Integration LLUH -ICP is stewarding workforce development for community heatlh workers as a major intiative in the 2020 - 2022 CHIS cycle in order to pilot integration in school districts, hospital systems, and with non -profit partners where CHW's have traditionally not been hired in our region. LLUH -ICP provides the management and oversight of programs as part of our operations and supports FTE dollars to pilot CHW work in order to prove the return on investment for sector partners to sustain the workforce over time. To view this video visit : https://icp.llu.edu/our -work/chw- integration \"Community Health Worker - She saw me as human .\" CHW Health System Integration In FY 2019 LLUH initiated a pilot with three CHWs who integrated into high -risk areas where vulnerable populations access our health system but face undue health burdens in trying to address their health and wellness post -encounter in either inpatient or outpatient settings. This includes linkages to LLUH's priority on disease related to poverty through a focus on at-risk infants and mothers in the NICU and a t-risk adults with diabetes in the outpatient Diabetes Treatment Center. Due to the initial success of the pilot program in 2019, LLUH is formally creating a CHW Integration and Intervention Program through the Institute for Community Partnerships based on the following parameters: To date, LLUH hospitals invested in three CHW positions and manager to run the program. The ICP management/operations positions oversee the CHEW contracts in school districts in addition to the establishment of the CHW program a t LLUH. The LLUH CHWs will be entirely focused on the target population, those from underserved communities who lack access to services and face poverty, based on the community benefit investment in this community intervention. It is the goal of this progr am to use the hospital's investment to intervene and lighten the burden of the social determinants of health through community peers who are expertly trained in recognizing and navigating the social determinants of health. While the CHWs are employed by LL UH and meet people who represent vulnerable populations in our region, they are assigned to work in the community with patients and their families who represent the target population, as defined by community benefit parameters. To ensure this is upheld, CHWS working within the LLUH program will abide by the following metrics: A 51% minimum of time in the community with a stretch goal of 60% time spent in the community will serve as the macro indicator for the program. Secondary outcomes related to special populations, as well as demographic information, will be captured to study the impact of CHWs working with underserved or marginalized populations. Outcomes will be presented in community benefit reporting and in research published and presented on in professional circles by I CP to help increase the access and technical assistance available to health systems on how to integrate and create this CHWs at LLUH spend hours with patients who face multiple social determinant burdens as our team motto is: \"Time is the Medicine\" LLUH System CHW s spend a minimum of 51% of their time out in the community wit h a target intervention of 60% or 3 days a week. In 2020, due to outreach calls and food box deliveries, This was closer to 60 -70%. resource in other health systems. LLUH CHWs will focus on home visits and community outreach classes/peer support groups for vulnerable populations with the following programmatic goals: Time is the Medicine - Unlike health care providers and clinical staff, the CHWs are able to do time -intensive interventions outside the four walls of our clinical settings. This is accomplished through a trusted relationship as CHWs are able to quickly establish as community peers and engage with community members once they are home. CHWs work with community members and their family members to navigate complex social and health systems to address, manage, and maintain their help once these community members are no longer \"patients\" in our facility, but integrating back to the home to get the care they need. Intervention & Accompaniment - CHWs are able to provide supportive coaching and mentoring to help those they work with navigate complex social services and benefits like (DMV, Social Security, Veterans Affairs, etc.). CHWs are also able to provide accompaniment by meeting with community members at appointments and in outpatient and inpatient systems o f care (both LLUH and non- LLUH), and CHWs are able to support individuals in accessing resources for survival needs like food banks, housing and rental assistance, and other supportive sources in the community offered by non -profits and community organizat ions. Special Populations Focus - The LLUH CHWs will be stationed in critical access areas of the health system in order to become connected to community members who are experiencing the highest levels of need. The following are special populations the CHW program will address: At-risk infants and mothers Adults with diabetes Children and youth with diabetes Homeless individuals in our Emergency Department Individuals experiencing escalation of symptoms related to Sickle Cell Diseases Individuals experienc ing a lack of access to mental health or behavioral health services and resour ces; Victims of violent crime or injury who receive trauma -related surgical interventions; High utilizers of the LLUH system who experience undue social determinant burden and req uire extensive, supportive accompaniment and linkage to health and social services upon discharge from the LLUH inpatient system. Finally, special to this program is the two -for-one investment that creating the CHW workforce does to create jobs and develo p the workforce. To give CHWs jobs is an act of economic development as people doing the work of a CHW often need the same access to employment as those they are tirelessly serving. CHWs are traditionally not part of the systems they support, nor do they h ave access to the workplace benefits. Employment reduces the reliance on grant -based or project \u2014based employment for CHWs, a source of income insecurity and provides them full benefits. In addition to the programmatic outreach and intervention provided by the CHWs, the creation of the jobs for community members who are trained in this work is also a fulfillment of the community benefit workforce development strategy as priority hiring is reserved for people with lived experience in navigating the social det erminants of health, having lived experience with poverty, and those who have received training to become community health workers in the communities from which they are from or with special populations of which they have special knowledge or lived experie nce. In FY 20, LLUH's CHWs were deployed to: Provide outreach and enrollment to the Diabetes Treatment Center and engage Hispanic and Latino community members experiencing metabolic syndrome and pre -diabetes into Diabetes Prevention Program (based on the CDC programs) for free, year -long classes and mentoring in improving health outcomes. Provide outreach and CH W intervention ( accompaniment , home and phone follow -up calls and visits, and ongoing support) to mother s with medically fragile infants who are discharged from the NICU and face multiple social determinant of health risks upon returning to community. Outreach and engagement with the homeless and victims of traumatic injury in the Emergency Room to support with linkages to services and alternative options for community members. Outreach and engagement with patients living with Sickle Cell Disease in the emergency room to provide peer supportive services and supports. Food security screening calls and delivery of food boxes to known community members with SDOH risk factors. Resource screening calls in partnership with the PossAbilities program to members of the Sickle Cell and Angeles Esp ecial es (Mother's with special needs children) support groups. The CHW Integration Model at LLUH developed by ICP staff is undergoing testi ng through implementation and research for ongoing outcomes reporting and to support future capacity building of partners integrating CHWs into their programs: Outcomes - CHW Integration FY 20 School Districts - Community Health Education W orkers ICP contracts and provides technical assistance to School Districts to create CHEW jobs: LLUH through ICP is building community health education worker teams (CHEWs) in local school districts in order to extend outreach to at -risk populations of students, or youth who are at -promise, based on what districts most need addressed. The CHEWs are trained to work in the education system and through relationship building and home visits, extend outreach, social supports, linkages and accompaniments to families, resource support, and informal peer counseling to help students who are chronically absent, face undue health challenges, or are experiencing mental or behavioral health crisis have additional, intensive supportive resources. ICP currently contracts with 2 school districts and employs eight CHEWS working in the community, a manager of integration to oversee the project, and is conducting interventions with families who have children who are chronically absent (one district) and the other district is a focuse d intervention to prevent against suicidal ideation or action (behavioral health prevention). ICP's contracts with the local school districts provide workforce development dollars for CHW integration into school districts with ICP contributing the manage ment time and infrastructure to support the integration and outcomes. Future school sites are intended in the coming years to grow the program and root community health and education workers into the fabric of the school district's workforce to provide sus tained and critical outreach to families of school -age youth who suffer undue burdens from multiple social determinant of health risk factors. CHEWS have intervened in the 2019 -2020 school year specifically to address: Vaccine compliance (increase access to school) Behavioral health risk assessment and risk -factor reduction for suicide among school -age children & youth Chronic absenteeism Food & housing insecurity due to Covid- 19 Outcomes - CHEW Team in FY 20 CHW Integration Project - FIND Food Bank ICP invested (dollars reported in FY 19 numbers) in non -profit, community -based organizational partners who want to expand outreach to their populations through the addition of community health workers through either seed funding for community health worker positions or, through technical assistance with grant activities to help increase partner potential to acquire dollars to hire community health workers. ICP invested in a community health worker integration program with a non -profit partner in the Coachella Valley where FIND Food Bank added a CHW to th eir outreach team. The CHW is able to support families in both Calf resh & SNAP benefits with potential reimbursement for these services as part of the longer sustainability plan as the CHW supports the FIND team focusing on intensive outreach visits to at- risk families . FIND Food Bank is a critical food security partner in the Coachella Valley. Because of LLUH's inv estement in a CHW to join , FIND was able to deploy the LLUH sponsored CHW to support emergecy food relief. FIND Food Bank helped LLUH reach an additional 997 people wi th the work of 1 CHW. How the LLUH hospital's Community Benefit dollars support CHW Workforce Integration All four licensed hospitals invest in ICP operations in order to carry out this level of partnership, responsiveness, and stewardship of the integration of CHWs into the health system. The CHWs in the health system are hired by the Institute for Communit y Partnerships and integration is managed to guarantee that 51% or more of the CHW labor is time spent outside the health system following patients as they re- integrate into community and follow their recommended health and social plans of care. Additional ly, through food security efforts in FY 20 and other public service programs such as LLUH CHWs help community members regardless of their relationship to LLUH. In the case of ICP contracts, like with school districts, only operational expenses above and beyond contractual revenue for FTEs are reported as community benefit. Investments in partners hiring CHWs are made in programmatic agreements to ensure outcomes reporting in alignment with community outreach and impact outcomes. In fiscal year 20 , with the onset of the pandemic, CHWs spent over 70% of their actual work days providing intensive support services in the community and in clinical settings : to discharged patients, providing navigational support community members to access resources, making referrals for people with increasing social determinant needs, and served as the backbone of food security and delivery efforts. LLUH -ICP is investing in non- profit partners who hire CHWs and support workforce development. Green Space: Jardin de Salud 52 Community Gardner Plots. 35 rows for production to support local food markets. In 2020, Huerta del Valle, LLUH -ICP, and S AC Health System partnered to install a community garden at the S AC Norton Clinic on 3rd Street in downtown San Bernardino. Huerta del Valle is a non -profit with a pioneering vision to place \"one community garden per mile of our region.\" Mor e than a garden, Huerta is an outdoor community center: families rent plots for affordable rates, there are community education and training efforts to help people learn to grow food and buy local, and there is a larger scale agricultural production and CS A (community supported agriculture) program to get organic, fresh food out to the community. Huerta has done what many community gardens fail to do, they have created a vibrant place for community . Jardin de Salud, the garden of health, is an incredible equity effort to bring organic, nutritious food to a food desert area of San Bernardino where the neighborhoods lack access to affordable, healthy produce. A Garden Grows During Covid -19 \"The Lord will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs in a sun -scorched land and will strengthen your frame. You will be like a well -watered gar den, like a spring whose waters never fail.\" Isaiah 58:11 (NRSV) \"To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow.\" - Audrey Hepburn How the LLUH hospital's Community Benefit dollars supported Jardin de Salud Loma Linda University Medical Center and Loma Linda University Children's hospitals have made historic year -over -year investments in SAC Health System to support the transition to FQHC sta tus with bridge funding to ensure operational sustainability. Additionally, ICP has allocated staff time to support the implementation, installation, and community engagement in the garden. Beginning in 2020, with the transition of the SAC Health System through the rate setting process as an FQHC, SAC Health System made available the land and LLUH was able to invest community benefit dollars to support community members to plan and create a garden. Additionally dollars for fencing and other major infras tructure supports were contributed by the hospitals through community health investment dollars and the health system provided additional infrastructure support through campus engineering (not reported as hospital community benefit dollars), but part of LL UH's overall investment in the success of this community green space. 30 families are now coming weekly to the garden to tend their food plots and over 130 volunteers have safely worked to support this community effort during Covid -19. More than a Garden Jardin de Salud is not just a healthy food access strategy: it is an outdoor community center and more relevant to the community than the partners could have imagined due to Covid -19. The garden is milestone in fulfillment of the 2019 CHNA when the community asked for safe green spaces along with jobs, food, and housing as top priorities. Access to Care & Services for Underrepresented Populations Making people whole. Serving populations with additional social determinant burdens and or those who require intentional efforts to gain access to health care is part of the heart of the mission at LLUH to continue the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ to make man whole.\" Every year, ICP works with hospital leadership to ensure the programs and services that are included in the community benefit report are part of \"what counts\" and support the fulfillment of priorities and needs identified in the Community Healt h Needs Assessment. The following programs are existing hospital outreach and supportive services and include some of ICP's work on behalf of the hospitals with spec ial populations of focus. All programs represented in this report are carefully reviewed in accordance with best -practice and guidance for community benefit accounting and are included in the implementation strategy as part of LLUH' s inclusion, disparity -reduction strategies. The following programs are featured as pa rt of our access to health & behavioral health care and services: Agricultural Essential Workers and residents of the Coachella Valley , the region of the Inland Empire with the highe st rates of poverty per capita; Access to people living with disabilities through the PossAbilities program; Access to behavioral health services ; Regional alignment on early childhood development screening, intervention, partner coordination, and service integration through Help Me Grow; Specialty intervention se rvices to victims of violent trauma ; Providing patients whole -person cancer care and state and national research efforts through the Cancer Registry services ; Access to care through safety -net FQHC providers of primary, behavioral, and specialty health care to meet the needs of lower -income people with compounded social determinant of health burdens. Access to Health Services: Rural Communities & Agricultural Essential Workers in the Coachella Valley The Coachella Valley, located in Riverside County, contains some of Southern California's most iconic desert landscapes and destinations from Palm Springs to the Salton Sea . Lesser -known by visitors to the region, the Coachella Valley is also a major agricultural center in the State, and an important part of California's agricultural economy along with the Central Valley. According to Growing Coachella Valley,4 the region contributes over $4 Billion in agricultural produce and employs almost 19,000 people. Most notably the region produces 95% of the dates in the United States along with other critical crops such as bell peppers, lettuce, grapes, artichokes, broccoli, watermelon, carrots and citrus. The Coachella Valley is one California's most economically impoverished regions in the state ... Nearly half of all Coachella Valley residents live at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. That is 21.8% of the population in 2018, compared to the state average in California of 12.8%. ... with some of the most inspiring community -mobilization and resiliency efforts in the state due to the work of partners like FIND Food Bank, Lift to Rise, Desert Health Care District, and the faith -based Catholic Church partners in the region. 4 Growing Coachella Valley: http://growingcoachellavalley.org/ ICP & Partners: \"Coachella Connect\" Health ICP, local community partners, and local par tner health systems organized community health services fair s before the impact of Covid- 19 in order to bring basic medical and dental services to under -served populations out in the East Coachella Valley; populations that often lack access to services due to socioeconomic, and geographic realities. Services provided by the LLU H team focused on vision, and comprehensive dental services , basic health screening to refer at -risk community members for primary care, and oth er social supportive services . The Community Partners Involved in Health Service Fairs have been : Our Lady of Guadalupe Church (Mecca), the San Bernardino Diocese, Consulate of Mexico in San Bernardino, Galilee Center, Riverside University Health System, Loma Linda University Health: Eye Institute, School of Dentistry, Children's Hospital, Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine. ICP intends to reconvene partners to continue health service fairs in rural or under -served areas in our counties in the co ming years once the Covid -19 restrictions are lifted to provide this vital safety -net service in our region. For FY2020 there wer e two Coachella Connect events: 11/17/19 and 2/23/20 Total Participants: 160 Community Members # of volunteers: 113 o # of staff: 22 o # of students: 60 o # of other volunteers: 31 # of volunteer hours : ~904 Community Outreach & Liaison Support Service in the Coachella Valley In collaboration with the Loma Linda University Children's Hospital Indio Clinic and ICP to support the clinic's outreach and supportive services are integrated, relevant, and responsive to the unique needs of the community. CH funded a position in order for a community outreach coordinator (liaison) to facilitate conversation, outreach, and integration of these vital children's services. Prior to the opening of the clinic, residents of the region had to drive almost 75 miles west for children's primary and specialty care services. With the opening of the Indio clinic as a vital safety -net service for children's health care and a future site for SAC Health System to bring dental care for families, the Community Outreach Coordinator helps ensure the community has access to the range of services provided. Outre ach Efforts in Coachella Valley A Community Outreach Coordinator (Liaison ) provides vital linkages to specific schools, neighborhoods, churches, and community members to assess their on- going needs and report back to the health system (ICP) and local LLUCH children's clinic to ensure support services and health outreach is target ed and tailored to the needs of the community. The Coachella Youth Advisory was launched to represent the communities of the Eastern Coachella Valley to strengthen connection of families from those neighborhoods to local health care resources and increa se opportunities for health career development and inclusion in pipeline workforce development programs. The advisory is building up to 8 local youth group who are the core representatives and an extended group of 15 -20 youth as local advocates. Access for People Living with Disabilities: PossAbilities The mission of PossAbilities is to provide new direction and hope through physical, social, and educational interaction with peers and their community. This free membership program is tailored to persons with physical disabilities such as limb amputation, stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, and sickle cell disease. Loma Linda University Medical Center funded the program since 201 9. The program offers physically disabled individuals who were born with or have suffered a permanent physical injury a sense of community and a healthy social network. PossAbilities is one of LLUH's longsta nding community benefit program as a free community outreach program developed by Loma Linda University Health. Membership is open to both disabled and able -bodied peoples: with support groups providing community safety -net and supportive services. In 2019 , the program averaged approximately 7,000 members with over 3,400 followers on the Facebook page. Benefits Provided through PossAbilities: Social and recreational activities Peer mentoring Adaptive sports Support groups Discounted membership to the Drayson Center with adaptive equipment Discount prescription program On-campus cafeteria and snack shop discounts Grant and scholarship opportunities Outreach in FY 20 While many of the events coordinated by the program were suspended in FY 20 due to Covid- 19 restrictions, PossAbilities shifted support services to virtual support groups and outside outreach events, with a focus on social, mental, and behavioral health stabili zation and supports. Additionally, the LLUH CHW's provided supportive outreach to the Sickle Cell and Angels Especiales support groups to screen PossAbilities members for increased risks due to the economic and isolating impact of Covid- 19. A survey was a lso conducted to assess the needs of the broader program population and found among members as part of ICP's ongoing Community Health Needs Assessment efforts and summarized in the implementation update section Thanks to the collaboration between the PossAbilities program and LLUH health system CHWs, PossAbilities program members were provided individual outreach and screening calls to ensure access to critical resources. PossAbilities Community Assessment Outcomes in FY 21 LLUH ICP & PossAbilities c onducted a joint survey of members in August of 2021 and from the needs assessment of this group, are reviewing options to increase supportive services based on these findings. They survey was the same as was used in the 2019 broader Community Health Needs Assessment and as additional groups are surveyed in FY 21, ICP will research and review the changing landscape of community needs over the 2019 baseline. The following are data and indicators identified in the August 2020 survey: Participant Demographics (N= 93 Participants ) 60.2% 36.7% Employment: o 22.6% employed full time o 16.1% employed part time o 11.8% not employed but looking for work o 6.5% unemployed and not looking for work o 16.1% retired o 26.9% disabled and not able to work $50,000 - $74,999 average household income Insurance Status: 41.4% had private insurance 27.6% were covered by MediCal 17.2% were covered by Medicare 11.5% had other insurance Population SDOH In dicators: 68.8% have a permanent disability 14.6% had a place to live, but was worried about losing it in the future; 1.1% did not have a steady place to live 20.7% want help with finding work, 6.5% want help with keeping a job 22.6% felt lonely or isolated fairly often or frequently 22.6% felt crime in their community was serious or very serious 35.5% say that crime has increased in their communities in the past three years 12.0% were without health insurance within the last 12 months Access to Be havioral Health Services While many of the LLUH programs in this report provide social engagement and reduction of isolation, there are other services provided through Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (LLUBMC) to address critical access is sues pertaining to some of the barriers to behavioral and mental health care in our counties: Referral Support Services to Other Providers of Mental Health Care LLUBMC sponsors the psychology interns in training to conduct screenings geared towards the general community in the Inland Empire, senior facilities, and or employer organizations, or with vulnerable populations who may require treatment with a clinical therapist conducting program- specific questions and interpretations of depression screening a nd mental health assessment results. This is a non- reimbursed service with the benefit of this service is that patients referred to BMC who do not qualify for care at Loma Linda's facility are provided extensive referral and support to link them to care provided by other facilitates or providers in the region to reduce the risk of people falling between the gaps between California's tier -based system of care. Community Outreach The LLUBMC staff conduct Behavioral Health Education and Awareness activitie s involve trainings, presentations, and in- service opportunities typically geared towards professionals, clinicians, general community and/or employer organizations. LLUBMC staff provides outreach and education in the community to reduce the stigma of ment al health and increase awareness of services available throughout the region through county and local providers . The goal is to provide information on topics within the scope of behavioral health that will reduce stigma, increase knowledge, and assist comm unity members in accessing services with focus on mental health and substance abuse for children, adolescents, and adults. The primary locations for this outreach is school districts, community centers, and local non- profit organizations who request speake rs. Community Support - Meeting Space While the onset of Covid- 19 shifted community support groups, like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), the LLUBMC provides meeting space for organizations that support the continued and ongoing health and well -being of people who have overcome substance use and/or challenges in their behavioral health experience. For the first half of 2019, prior to the Covid- 19 restrictions, LLUBMC provided weekly meeting space to AA. Access to Early Intervention & Prevention Services for Children Loma Linda University Childre n's Hospital (LLUCH) currently holds a First 5 Grant 5 for the Help Me Grow initiative. Help Me Grow (HMG) is a system that builds multi -sector collaborations and assists families, child health care providers, early education providers, and human service pr oviders to recognize early signs of developmental or behavioral concerns. HMG motivates providers to conduct systematic, standardized developmental screenings of young children and providing them the electronic linkages to improve care across the region fo r children with developmental delays. HMG assists, when needs are identified, in finding programs designed to address those needs. It is an efficient and effective system that builds on existing resources by improving access to services for families, infan ts and children through age eight. First 5 San Bernardino and First 5 Riverside, in partnership with Loma Linda Children's Health, convened key stakeholders and experts across diverse sectors, including health departments, early intervention and preschool education, and medical providers to engage in the planning of a dual county HMG system model for the Inland Empire. LLUCH is investing significant workforce time in the leadership of this regional collaboration to ensure it improves the health and well -being of the children not only served by the hospital, but in our entire region. Between the two counties of the Inland Empire , over 400,000 children ages 0 -5 have the potential to benefit from the Ages and Stages (ASQ -3) screening tools and benefit from referrals and increased provider connectivity in addressing their needs. LLUH and regional pediatric care providers will now have the ability on the LLUH Epic platform, the electronic health record system, to access the screening and resource needs of children in the program. Making the LLUH Epic platform available to LLUH physicians, non- LLUH physicians, and other providers of care for children in early start programs is one way LLUH is operating above and beyond the standard of care for people in our region. The linkages provider on behalf of children enrolled in the program will help all providers in responding to critical int erventions, preventions early in children's lives. 6 Increasing Access to Care for School -Age Children LLUH and the FQHC Partner SAC Health System, is providing consultative support on the establishment of school -based districts in order to extend care to families where they are more easily able to access community- based services: local schools. In October 2019, San Bernardino City Unified School District and SAC Health System launched a school - based clinic in the district's Enrollment Center where fami lies can access health care resources for their children and family members. While the clinic is currently closed due to the impact of Covid- 19, t he clinic is vital infrastructure that now exists and is ready for implementation once students can safely return to school sites. focused on providing access to children who currently lack access to care and for children who need vaccines and annual check -ups in order to enroll in school. With school -based clinics and CHEWs working in school districts, the collaboration potential between LLUH and the multi -sector partners is opening a new chapter of increasing access to care for at -risk populations: this is a new phase of development and possibility in the region. 6 Only costs incurred by LLUH above and beyond grant funding are counted as community benefit in the reporting of dollar amounts Hospital -Based Violence Prevention: Trauma Prevention Program LLUH hospitals are Level -1 trauma centers in the region and frequently provide the emergency and trauma care to victims of crime or gun violence in our region. Trauma surgeons began to notice that g unshot victims were often returning to emergency rooms from multiple incidents in a cycle of violence perpetrated by their life circumstances and association with local gangs. To begin to provide supportive services to multiple gun shot wound victims and othe r victims of community violence, LLUMC invests in program managers to support safety outreach and education to prevent injuries based on trends in our emergency department. The program convenes community partners in monthly discussions to address trends an d needs of populations of people at -risk for violence and through a community -informed steering committee, works reduce risk of violence in our community. The Hospital -based violence prevention program works closely with community partners and the CHW in t he ED. In FY 20, the ICP CHW in the Emergency Room partnered with the Trauma Prevention Program linked services in order to provide peer- supportive services to victims of violence while they recuperate in the hospital and to support patient's re -entry to community with supportive services and alternatives as a way out of the cycle of violence. Coordinated Cancer Center Care LLUH's Cancer Center is at the forefront through whole person cancer care and the Cancer Registry team in providing the comprehensive services to the community that are critical to our region. The cancer objectives for Healthy People 2020 support monitori ng trends in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival to better assess the progress made toward decreasing the burden of cancer in the United States. The objectives reflect the importance of promoting evidence -based screening for cervical, colorectal, and breast cancer by measuring the use of screening tests. For cancers with evidence- based screening tools, early detection must include the continuum of care from screening to appropriate follow - up of abnormal test results and referral to cancer treatment. LLUH committed to treating interrelated factors that contribute to the risk of developing cancer. These same factors contribute to the observed disparities in cancer incidence and death among racial, ethnic, and underserved groups. The most obvious factor s are associated with a lack of health care coverage and low socioeconomic status (SES). SES is most often based on a person's: income , level of education, occupation, s ocial status in the community , and geographic location. Identified Needs - Specific to our region: 1. Lower than average breast cancer risk although higher than average breast cancer mortality in the Inland Empire. 2. Higher than average lung cancer rates in the Inland Empire. 3. Higher rates of colorectal cancer incid ence and mortality rates among Inland Empire males than the statewide average. 4. Higher incidence and mortality rates for cervical cancer among Inland Empire women than the statewide average. 5. Higher incidence and mortality rate of prostate cancer among Inla nd Empire African American men than the statewide average.

How the LLUH hospital's Community Benefit dollars support programs & special populations In addition to investments in ICP operations, partner investments on behalf of the hospitals, and implementation of programs in fulfillment of the CHNA priorities and CHIS plan, programs in the hospitals that meet the needs of the community benefit target populations and identified in the CHNA are reviewed annual to ensure that the number of people served and dollars reported are in alignment with the implementation strategy. ICP and the hospital finance teams review all community benefit categories and program and operational costs to ensure cost accounting expenses incurred are reported per licensed hospital in this annual community benefit report and on each hospital's 990 Schedule H. Regional Collaborations & FY 21 Implementation Update The Second Year of the 2020 -2022 LLUH CHIS Cycle Fiscal year 21 (July 1, 2019 - June 30, 2020) represents a unique and unprecedented year in community benefit implementation with the impact of Covid- 19 impacting Southern California more heavily in July and December of 2020 with surges of cases and inpatient hospitalizations pushing the local ICU capacity to well below the 15% state benchmar k and at times to 0% capacity. The guiding priorities defined by the 2019 CHNA remain the focus as well as LLUH's comm itment to the implementation strategy remains strong. Throughout the shifting landscape of 2020, LLUH through ICP was able to continue routine operations w ith modifications to virtual or field- based services (with appropriate safety protocols). Developmen t Objectives of the 2020 -2022 CHIS8 The community benefit partnership macro implementation goals that direct community benefit health investments are: 1. Scholarships that support workforce entry for adults, youth, and people from marginalized or populations of focus. 2. Pipeline programs to introduce underserved middle & high school students to healthcare careers and healthy lifestyle choices. 3. Support the integration of community health workers into multiple sectors: health care, education, and non- profit organizations. 4. Increase access to healthy and affordable food options through community health worker interventions, community gardens, and access to sa fe outdoor green space. 5. Decrease social isolation through multi -generational community engagement and increase access to mental health resources, screenings, and support for parents and children. 6. Invest in lifestyle interventional programs that support at -risk populations in improving health by reducing social determinants of health burden and increase social cohesion and access to care. LLUH will continue community benefit investments in these ar eas in FY 21 with additional emphasis on working with partners or programs that alleviate the additional burdens caused by Covid -19 and the economic impact on community members. 8 The CHIS Report is available on and partners are working to adjus t implementations and community partner planning efforts that have been in development with a long -term focus on effort and attention to our work in the community in a post -Covid- 19 world. The f ollowing collaborations in development in 2021 are a sign of hope and encouragement that the infrastructural work to strengthen the safety -net of community -based providers continues and will continue to align with community members to build resiliency. The following collaborations are in -development FY 21: 1. Increased alignment on partner responsiveness to Homeless : LLUH ICP is working with local health system partners at Kaiser, Dignity, and Providence hospital partners in our region to collaborate on how we can capacity -build CBO's in the region and better align partners to shared protocols in managing the \"community system of care\" network in our region. The goals are increased alignment, providing technical assistance and facilitation to strengthen the e xisting network between partners, and reviewing potential collective impact through development or investment in gaps in the network where additional recuperative care services would support target populations within the broader homeless population. 2. Alig nment to county workforce development programs as they come back online with the alleviation of Covid- 19. With a county -wide investment and focus on youth, LLUH through ICP is involved in regional collaborations to increase the bridge from high school to college by connecting our pipeline programs to the larger county efforts . Uplift SB City is an initiative to incentivize students to do well, achieve good grades, and stay in school in order to decrease disengaged youth and increase graduation rates. Upli ft SB City engages a multi -stakeholder advisory to help guide the strategic plan for change in the county and unify partners on collective goals, below. The program is focused on the long -term outcomes for local youth in graduating from college, getting jobs in our region, climbing career ladders in the local market, owning local businesses, and buying homes in the region. 3. Participate in regional data collection efforts and advance the efforts for ongoing data collection and evaluation through community conversations and surveying in real -time, year -over -year . LLUH ICP has joined Measure for America in a macro regional data and is developing a second round of community conve rsations virtually on Zoom and through community surveying. 4. Supporting the County with Enrollment Outreach, Retention, and Recruitment for at -risk populations eligible for Medi -Cal:9 In FY 21, LLUH ICP was awarded a contract to support the San Bernardino County Transitional Assistance Department (TAD) by conducting specialized outreach services to engage or re -engage Medi -Cal members into their insurance status. The target populations for this outreach are previously incarcerated, black youth, families or people with mixed immigration or documentation status, the homeless, those living with severe mental or behavioral health disorders, and those living with disability and/or are otherwise eligible for Medi -Cal due to annual income. Notable about this partnership is ICP is providing the technical assistance on this outreach service by aligning three community partners to share the intervention goals, focus each partner by their strengths in the implementation strategy, and through collective impact report outcomes. United Way Inland Empire is providing rapid enrollment as the hub with El Sol and Cope deploying field and virtual outreach to the target populations to engage and refer to 2 -1-1 United Way hub for rapid, electronic enrollment and re -enrollment services. 5. Finally, LLUH ICP is running special projects and engagements in areas of development to remain in real -time responsiveness to community priorities in FY 21 and fulfill our im plementation strategy: a. The development of a \"Community Fellows Scholarship Program, \" African American Mentoring Program (AAMP) , and survey efforts with workforce development partners to better align regional non- profit partner resources and strategies on workforce development and to bring more partners to the table to invest in scholarships. The AAMP was launched at the end of 20 20 with 25 LLU health professions students signed -up to mentor black students from San Bernardino City Unified School District. LLUH ICP is engaging with new partners in the Murrieta/Temecula region of Riverside County and a new partnership with Health Ca reer Connections to create more workforce apprenticeship and workforce opportunities for students of color across the region. b. The development of adolescent psychiatry services with local community -based partners to provide rapid access for students in l ocal school districts to psychiatric services, especially considering the shortage of this resource in the region. 9 Only costs to operate servi ces at ICP above contractual or grant revenue are counted as community benefit dollars. c. COvid -19 Vaccine education and outreach to people of color and disenfranchised communities where trust in government -run vaccination progra ms has historically been a burden. ICP is conducting virtual education sessions with health, mental health, and the health care professionals to answer questions and build trust in communities of color. As of the writing of this report, over 275 people have had special access to physicians with vaccine expertise in community virt ual question and answer forums and over 7,500 people on social media . Additionally, the pre-and- post findings from the IECAAC Covid Summit show there was a significant change in attitude among participants in favor of the vaccine. According to Rev. Casey, \"People are still thanking us and mentioning the summit [recording] even if they are not in favor of the vaccine.\" d. Development of Produce Rx program and linkage between SAC Healthy System and Jardin de Salud through a community health worker: Thanks to the partnership and support of the Ardmore Institute for Health LLU H ICP and SAC Health System have developed a prescription program where physicians can write a prescription and refer patients to the garden for community -based services, health food, and recreation. A community health worker will provide the peer support and linkage to ensure families access services. LLUH to Open New Hospital in FY 21 As part of LLUH's continued commitment to our community, the campus transformation project that has been underway the past decade is culminating with the opening of a new adult and children's hospitals in FY 21 with the highest level of safety features through the steel structure and seismic requirements in the state. The adult and children's hospitals reflect our continued commitment to primary, specialty, and trauma services in the region with individual patient rooms to provide the best healing environment. While Covid- 19 has impacted many aspects of the hospital this year, the new hospitals are still on -target and very close to their original opening f or late Spring/early summer of 2021. While LLUH maintains focus on the on-going effort to improve health in our region and strengthen utilization of care services in the outpatient and community- based systems of care, we are building the 21st century inpatient care infrastructure that is tailored to the safest seismic requirements possible in our region so LLUH can continue to be a safety -net provider of comprehensive care to the diverse peoples of the Inland Empire.

The federal government esta blishes general guidelines for the administration of CHIP benefits. Eligibility depends on your income, the number of people in your family and state rules. In almost every state, children in families with income up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level are covered. In more than half the states, the income eligibility for children can be even higher. c.
