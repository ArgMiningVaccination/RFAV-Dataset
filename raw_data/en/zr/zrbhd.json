In 1718-lady Mary Wortley reported that turks had a habit of inoculating themselves. With the fluid taken from mild cases of small pox and got her son inoculated. In 1796-Edward Jenner invented the small pox vaccine from cow pox vaccine. In 1853-vaccine made compulsory. In 19th century the city of Leicester in UK achieved high decrease in small pox. There approach was to reduce vaccination and increase sanitation. VACCINE Vaccine is the immuno -biological substance designed to produce specific production of antibodies against a given disease. TYPES OF VACCINE 1. live [attenuated] 2. killed 3. Toxoids 4. cellular fraction 5. combination LIVE VACCINE They are prepared from live organism but they are attenuated. These organism loose there capacity to induce the full blown disease but still maintain the immunogenicity. Immunization is generally achieved in single dose expect in polio. Example.....typhoid, measles, polio ADVANTAGE OF LIVE VACCINE. Single dose often sufficient to induce long lasting immunity. Strong immune response evoked. Local immunity produced. DISADVANTAGE OF LIVE VACCINE. Potential to revert to virulence. Poor stability. Potential for contamination. KILLED VACCINE Organisms are killed by chemicals ,heat. Stimulate the immunity. Safe but less effective than live vaccine. Cholera vaccine provided only 50% protection. Example..........cholera COMBINATION Many vaccine are combined to make it easier to give several vaccine at one time. Combination vaccine reduce both no of clinic visits and number of injections needed. Before combination vaccine are licensed, studies are carried out to ensure that ; -the Immune response to any of combine antigens is just as good as the response to the individual vaccine. -the rate of adverse reaction are the same as they would be if the vaccine were administrated separately Example........DPT, . REACTION DUE TO PROGRAMME ERROR. Faulty production of vaccine. Too much vaccine give in one dose Improper immunization. Wrong amount of diluents used. Vaccine combination Stored incorrectly Contra indications ignore NATUROPATHY CONCEPT ABOUT VACCINE. Vaccination has proved its efficacy by eradicating serious diseases like small pox. Vaccination basically helps to improve our own immune power It means we have inner power to immune ourselves but vaccine acts only as a stimulation to that power So by means of naturopathic priciples if we can evoke that inner potential then vaccination is not needed So if your lifestyle is harmonious and natural by proper AHARA and VIHARA you can improve immmunity naturally without needing external vaccination And if your lifestyle is disbalanced and unnatural then even vaccination may not protect you from disease. It all depends on "}
