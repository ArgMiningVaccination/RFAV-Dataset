Both ladies who organized and ran the retreat were highly qualified. Reya, owner of La Fortuna Wellness gave us a beautiful aerial yoga session as well as leading evening wellness sessions to guide us in self reflection and growth. Andrea from Riding into Life (Canada) led our biking trips and was so supportive in helping us build our biking skills and pushing past fears to see what we could do. So safe and supportive! If you are looking to put together a group retreat or plan to visit La Fortuna and would like try aerial yoga, I highly recommend Reya and La Fortuna Wellness.Denise thank you so much for your presence this incredible week we shared.

We will forever be grateful for her wisdom, love, compassion, and desire to help. I would highly recommend talking to her about her services if you have a mind to look inward and heal yourself, she's the real deal and we felt completely at home and comfortable with her. We spent two months traveling around Costa Rica with tons of amazing adventures and experiences, visiting Reya was hands down the most rewarding time spent here. Thank you!!!! It was a pleasure to hold space for you both! To help reawaken into your true essence and we peel back these layers of conditioning! Thank you for trusting yourselves to dive deeper in this spiral of life Written July 25, 2022This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited July 2022Traveled as a coupleWritten July 23, 2022 - Recalibrating my spiritAfter meeting Reya I felt she was qualified to work with me on self healing and forgiveness. I have had many Healing sessions over the years in Sedona Arizona and feel qualified to state that I know and I've been a healer when I meet one. I've been recently recovering from two serious injuries and needed a facilitator to assist me in clearing the effects of them. The session I had with her was very beneficial and has placed me in a path of clarity for the continued process of my own healing. I would highly recommend anyone with unresolved issues emotionally physically and spiritually to consider contacting her if you're in the La Fortuna area.What a blessing to cross paths with you! You are a being with an amazing amount of wisdom and I honor where your journey has led you. I appreciate being a part of this healing space for this cycle you are in.

With her beautiful energy and open personality Reya made me feel safe and very welcome in her home. It's easy to tell Reya puts love into her work and is passionate about sharing her wisdom. I'm very grateful for everything she taught me and the space she held for me to grow and heal within...And don't miss out on the amazing cacao!What a blessing to hold space on your sacred journey!

She's awesome. She has a beautiful energy and is very masterful in the work she does. I was in Fortuna for about 2 weeks and came to her for various modalities, including thai massage, reiki, and personalized ceremonies. I'm writing this review two months after grateful to have worked with her, because it was exactly what I needed at the time. She is very attentive and it's clear that she tailors the experience to each person. The space was home-y, private, and intimate, which I really appreciated. I also love her passion behind what she does. Highly recommend :)What an incredible transformation to witness and be a part of! It is an honor to walk this path and hold space with you. Thank you for showing up for yourself on a whole new level and trusting life! You have great things on your path and I can't wait to see how it unfolds for you Blessings infinitelyWritten March 8, 2022This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited December 2021Written March 7, 2022 - Excellent experienceI visited La Fortuna wellness for a yoga class and it turned into so much more then that. Reya, the owner of the wellness center, is knowledgeable and genuine. Her experience in health and wellness went far beyond the yoga class I attended with her. Her studio is intimate and comfortable. If your passing through La Fortuna for a day, a weekend or an extended stay, I would highly recommend passing through her center.It was so much fun to explore our bodies together and harmonize our spirits! Thanks for stopping in. I look forward to flying together soon! Keep spreading your light!! Blessings Written February 26, 2022This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited September 2021Traveled soloWritten February 26, such a gift!Where to begin? Reya is such a bright light; you immediately feel her warm, inviting energy as soon as you meet her. My friend and I did air yoga and reiki with her, and we both had such amazing experiences! Air yoga was a great way to slow down, decompress, and stretch after being active in La Fortuna for a couple of days. It was our first time doing reiki too which left me feeling at peace and so moved; she is truly gifted. I also ended up doing a tarot reading which emphasized and built upon what we talked about during our reiki session. The messages received were very relevant and meaningful to me at this point in my life. I highly recommend seeing Reya if you're ever in La Fortuna! I promise you won't be disappointed. It was like visiting an old friend who brings nothing but love, support, and guidance. Thank you again, Reya!It was an honor to hold space and create an experience so you can connect deeper to yourself! Keep trusting life and what it has for you. Stay connected to your power and intuition.

The only way to understand, is to experience it for yourself. I had the pleasure and blessing of attending a yoga class with Reya, the owner of La Fortuna Wellness Center, as well as partake in a sacred medicine ceremony. Reya emanates love, radiates a healing aura, and is incredibly knowledge in her areas of speciality. She treats her practice with the highest reverence and honor. I felt so safe in trusting her to hold space for my healing journey. The work she does is incredibly sacred, and she is certainly a catalyst for healing on every level - body, mind, heart, and spirit! I am so grateful that we connected, and will recommend her time and time again.Grace, thank you for your kind words! Your energy is a shooting star that illuminates this path we are on. Thank you for trusting yourself and this space to open and transform xoxo i am beyond grateful for crossing paths with you! Keep flying girl! Light it up wherever you go!Written February 28, 2022This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited February 2022Written February 26, 2022 - Life changing experienceReya is an absolute goddess. She really knows how to hold space in order to make you feel safe and held. I had a ceremony with her that changed everything for me for the better, so I had to bring my boyfriend as well and his experience was as liberating as mine. I also had the honour to take a class in Reiki with her and I couldn't ask for a better teacher. Words can't describe the impact her teachings and wisdom made on me - you really need to experience it for yourself in order to understand the energy behind my words. When I come back to Costa Rica I will definitely come back to Reya. Love and lightSo powerful what an amazing opportunity to cross paths with both of you! Thank you for the confidence and surrending to life and allowing growth and change! May your paths continue into infinite expansion!!

If you're looking for a relaxing but also new experience I definitely recommend doing air yoga. We went right after doing zip lining and a hike and we were very sore. The yoga allowed us to stretch out and relax. If you're ever in town looking for a yoga class, book her !

Mar 2023 Couples Reya is absolutely wonderful and incredible. Beautiful practice in a relaxing space. Her vibe is lovely and she's got a funny and cheeky side to her that is just mesmerizing. Make time for an aerial yoga class with her. I've done a lot of yoga over the last almost 10 years, and Reya was by far my best experience. We went twice and we are thinking of going a third time before we relocate to the coast. Reya, from Tony, Corey, and Tamara, thank you! Much love.
