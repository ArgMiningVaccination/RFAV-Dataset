These forms are required in order for NUHS to comply with Illinois state law. The law requires all college students born after 1956 to submit immunization information before registration, or to submit a letter that qualifies them for a medical or religious exemption. Under the State of Illinois College and University Immunization Act (77ILL.ADM.CODE 694), students must document immunity to tetanus, diphtheria, measles, rubella and mumps. Here are the records acceptable under the law to document immunity: - A copy of the student's \"Child Health Examination\" from an Illinois high school, college or university that provides complete information to assure compliance with the Act; or - Completion of Part III of the Certificate of Immunity, signed by a health care provider. This section requires documentation of either (a) vaccination for tetanus, diphtheria, measles, rubella and mumps, including the date(s) of vaccinations, or (b) date of confirmed illness documented by physician's records, or (c) immunity confirmed by blood titer or laboratory test, including a copy of the laboratory report; or - A statement of medical exemption based on medical contraindications: written, signed and dated by a physician, stating the specific vaccine or vaccines contraindicated and the duration of the contraindication or medical condition that contraindicates the vaccine(s); or - A written, signed and dated statement by the student describing his/her objection to immunization on the grounds that they conflict with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious organization, of which the student is an adherent member; or - A signed statement form a physician stating the student is pregnant or pregnancy is suspected, thus conferring an exemption. All records that are not in English must be accompanied by a certified translation. Anyone with a vaccine exemption may be excluded from the university in the event of a measles, rubella, mumps, or diphtheria outbreak in accordance with public health recommendations.
