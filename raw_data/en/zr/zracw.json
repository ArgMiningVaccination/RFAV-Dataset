In fluenza vaccination is the most effective method of primary prevention. Th is study was conducted to assess knowledge, attitude, practice , and barriers associated with influenza vaccination among HCPs at tertiary care hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. A multic enter analytical cross - sectional study was conducted among HCPs . D ata were collected using a structured questionnaire. All statistical analyses were conducted in R software. A total of 400 HCPs were enrolled , and among these , 67% had a high lev el of knowle dge and 65.5% had a positive attitude towards influenza vaccination. About 51% of HCPs adopted good practices leading to influenza vaccination. R esults identified major barriers for influenza vaccinations , in- clud ing unfamiliarity with vaccine availability (RII = 0.760), insufficient staff for administering the vaccine (RII = 0.649), lack of proper storage (RII = 0.625), safety concerns (RII = 0.613) , and cost of vaccine (RII = 0.602). More than half of the HCPs show e d a high level of knowledge, a positive attitude , and good practice against influenza vaccination . Despite the positive Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) scores and published guidelines, a very low percentage of HCPs were vac- cinated against i nfluenza . Many hindering factors were associated with influenza vaccination.

Introduction Respiratory tract infections are some of the most common acute illnesses, are classi- fied into two major groups including U pper R espiratory t ract (URI) and L ower R espira- tory tract I nfection (LRI), caused by bacteria, viruses, and mycobacteria [ 1 , 2 ] . I nfluenza virus remains leading causes of acute respiratory illness in humans and a variety of many other animal species [ 3 , 4 ] . Every year , about 20% of the world's populat ion gets infected with influenza, resulting in a substantial ly increase d risk of morbidity and mor tality [ 5 M.

Vaccines 2023 , 11 , 136 2 of 16 According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , an estimated 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and 290,000 to 650,000 influenza - related deaths occur globally. Influenza is considered one of the most - challenging health problems world wide [ 6 ] . Health care professionals , including doctors, nurses, pharmacist s , and paramedics , are a high - risk group s for contracting influenza infection due to their continuous exposure to pat ients having a known or unknown history of influenza - like illn esses [ 7 ] . Health care settings are the ideal environment for rapid spread of influenza [ 8 ] . Similarly , the hospital environment could be the source of nosocomial infection of influenz a to newly admitted patients [ 9 ] . People with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) infection are at greater risk of getting influenza due to decreased immunity. This can be further aggravated due to secondary bacterial in fection [ 10 ] . P atient s with MTB influenza co - infection are at an in- creased risk of death compared to those hospital ized with TB mono - infection [ 11 ] . Influenza vaccination is the most - effective method of primary prevention. Thus, Im- munization against influenza virus not only reduces the risk of infection among HCPs , but also improves patient safety and reduces mo rbidity a nd mortality among the patients [ 12 ] . Furthermore, the vaccination of HCPs also protects patients who have not been vac- cinate d or those who re spond ed poorly to vaccination [ 13 ] . D uring the COVID - 19 pan- demic, the risk of co - infection of influenza, SAR - CoV - 2 , and other respi ratory virus es has increased. Vaccination is effective to reduce the risk of influenza and its associated so cio - economic burden [ 14 ] . The Wor ld Health Organization (WHO) and Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization have recommend ed seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination fo r HCPs during this pandemic [ 15 ] . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , vaccine s provide 4 0 - 60 % coverage against influ- enza by reducing flu ill ness [ 16 ] . Despite these recommendations and the vaccine 's effec- tiveness, the vaccinat ion rate among HCPs remain globally low [ 17 ] . This picture is appli- cable globally , ranging from >90% (several Central American countri es) to <5% (Southeast Asia) [ 18 ] . In Pakistan, a lack of proper storage, a lack of sufficient staff to administer the vac- cine, side effects , safety concern s , cost of the vaccine, doubts about the effectiveness of the vaccine , and the fear of needle s are factors/barriers preventing HCPs from getting vac- cinat ed [ 7 ] . In Pakistan, there are currently no specific/published guidelines for influenza vaccinat ion in health c are settings [ 19 ] . In Pakistan, few studies have been conducted on influenza. Most of these we re conducted to estimate the influenza A virus burden and risk factors in the general population [ 20 , 21 ] . D ata on knowledge, attitude, practice , and bar- riers regarding influenza vaccination among HCPs in Pakistan are very limited [ 12 , 19 ] . This KAP survey of influenza vaccination among HCPs was the first study conducted in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Hence, the current study was planned to reduce the gap of data , and a KAP survey was designed to collect data about the knowledge, attitude, practice , and barriers regarding influenza vaccination among HCPs . The current data generate d could be used to devise strategies to improve vaccination coverage among HCPs and re- duce influenza - related morbidity and mortality. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Population A multicenter analytical cross - sectional study was conducted to assess k nowledge, attitude, practice , and barriers regarding influenza vaccination among HCPs working in 6 major tertiary care hospital s (Mayo Hospital Lahore (MHL), Lahore General Hospital in Lahore D istrict , Pakistan. Lahore is the capital city of Punjab Province located at 31\u00b032 59 latit ude and 74\u00b020 37 longitude [ 22 ] and the 2 nd - most - populous city of Pakistan. It is situated in the no rtheast- ern part of the country . The geographical locations of the hospital addresses were located on Google maps. A dot map was produced using the Q GIS software Version 3.2 (Open Vaccines 2023 , 11 , 136 3 of 16 Source Geospatial Foundation Project, Boston, MA, USA ) (Figure 1). All these hospitals were selected due to the availability of access to the facilities. There is no influenza vac- cination program currentl y going on in Lahore, Pakistan , and currently, there is no man- datory vaccination for influenza included in any vaccination program, especially for HCPs . Access was made available to collect the data. All respondents were very co - oper- ative. The i nternational guidelines by the World Health O rganization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are available online. The healthcare professionals enrolled in the current study were between the ages of 1 8 and 50 years, and they perform duties in pulmonology or microbiology in medical de- partments or shared sections that ha ve direct contact w ith patients (e.g., m edicine, Out- patient D epartment (OPD), X - ray rooms, and pharmacies). Those healthcare professionals suffering from any chronic co - morbidity were excluded. Figure 1. Study m ap a rea of the h ospitals ' l ocation in Lahore District . 2.2. Survey Instrumen t and Data Collection Procedure The study was conducted according to guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Committee for Biomedical Research, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan (Letter N o. 127/IRC/BMR). W ritten in- fo rmed consent was obtained from all study participants , who were aged 18 years or older. All participant s w ere given a consent form in English and verbally briefed about research objectives and data collection procedure s . The questionnaire was adopted from a previously validated (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87), self - administered questionnaire [ 12 ] , modified according to the objectives of the current study. The questionnaire com prised closed - ended or multiple - choice questions about knowledge, attitude, practice , and barri- ers regarding influenza vaccination. Data were collected during a face - to - face interview s by a trained research team (Registration No: A - 67641) registered with Pakistan Nursing Council . Each interview la sted approximately 20 min . Q uestions wer e written in English, which were easily understood by the participants. A unique coded identification number was given for each questionnaire to keep data confidential. A total of 400 HCPs were en- rolled in current study . The study protocol followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ( STROBE ) statement . The questionnaire comprised five sections : t he first section of the questionnaire had demographic data with 13 items ; the second section included questions about the partici- pant's knowledge with 15 items ; the third section consisted of questions related to the Vaccines 2023 , 11 , 136 4 of 16 attitude of respondents (10 items) ; the fourth section had questions about practice (8 items) ; the last section included questions regarding barriers regarding influenza vaccina- tion (11 items) . A pilot study was conducted in 30 HCPs to assess the validity of the ques- tionnaire tool. R eliability and internal consistency were assessed using Cronbach's alpha test. The overall reliability of the tool ( Cronbach's alpha) was 0.7. 2.3. Statistical Analysis The d atasets were entered into the EpiData software ( V ersion 3.1, Odense, Denmark, available at http://www.epidata.dk/ ) and validated for errors and inconsistencies by ran- dom ly checking the digital data with the hard copy record, then exported to Microsoft Excel ( V ersion 2016, Microsoft Office, USA) for further processing. All statistical analyses were conducted in the R software ( V ersion 4.2.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Categori cal variables were measure d as f requencies and proportions. 2.3.1. KAP Scores A t hree - point Likert scale (3 = yes, 2 = no, 1= don't know) was used to assess knowledge about thirteen items. A f ive - point Likert scale (5 = strongly agree, 4 = disagree, 3 = neutral , 2 = disagree, 1 = strongly disagree) was used to assess attitude about ten items and practice about eight items (5 = very frequently, 4 = frequently, 3 = occasionally, 2 = rarely, 1 = never). S cores were summed to generate an individual total k nowledge score ( range 1 - 45 ), total attitude score ( 1 - 50 ) , and total p ractice s core ( 1 - 40 ) for each respondent. These summed scores were divided by the number of respondents (N = 400) to calculate the mean score for each section (knowle dge, attitude , and practice) [ 23 ] . 2.3.2. Criteria for the Categorization of the KAP Score The scores of knowledge, attitude , and practice obtained were categorize d. O verall knowledge score was categorize d as high level of knowledge 75 % and low level of knowledge < 75%. The attitude of respondents was categorized as positive: total score > mean (37.3) and negative: total score < mean (37.3) . The practice of respondents was c ate- gorized as good: total scor e > median (40) an d poor: total score < m edian (40) [ 24 ] . 2.3.3. Composite of Total KAP Score The scores of knowledge, attitude , and practice obtained were categorized as h igh, l ow, p ositive, n egative, g ood , and p oor , respectively. The scores of each respondent were assessed by considering their composite scores on the K nowledge, Attitude, and P ractice (KAP) scale. A KAP r esponse with high, positive , a nd good score w as given a value = 1, w hile low, negative , and poor scores were given a value of 2. Similarly , the trends of the KAP scores were aggregated into 8 possible groups as follows: h igh knowledge, p ositive attitude , and good practice (1,1,1) KAP scores re presented by 1, l ow knowledge, negative attitude , and poor practice (2,2,2) KAP scores re presented by 2, h igh knowledge, negative attitude, and good practice (1,2,1) KAP scores re presented by 3, l ow knowledg e, negative attitude , and good practice (2,2,1) KAP scores re presented by 4, l ow knowledge, positive attitude , and good practice (2,1,1) KAP scores re presented by 5, h igh knowledge, positive attitude , and poor practice (1,1,2) KAP scores re presented by 6, l ow knowledge, positive attitude , and poor practice (2,1,2) KAP scores re presented by 7, and h igh knowledge, neg- ative attitude , and poor practice (1,2,2) KAP scores re presented by 8, respectively. In ad- dition, the frequency (percentages) of respondents tha t were repre sented by 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were aggregated. All those having good ratings for knowledge, attitude , and practice were rated as good KAP scores, and those that had a poor score on the three sc ales were rated as p oor KAP scores [ 25 ] . Vaccines 2023 , 11 , 136 5 of 16 2.3.4. Barriers Regarding Influenza Vaccination A f ive - point Likert s cale was used to assess barriers regarding influenza vaccination. N represent s the total number of respondent s ; 5 = the highest weighted score (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ; n1 = the number of participants who selected \"strongly disagree\" ; n2 = the number of participants who \"disagree\" ; n3 = the number of partic ipants \"neu- tral \" ; n4 = the number of participants select ing \"agree\" ; n5 = the number of participants who selected \"strongly agree.\" Additionally , to prioritize barriers among health care pro- fessionals, a Relative Importance Index (RII) was also calculated. RII = (1n1 + 2n2 + 3n3 + 4n4 + 5n5)/5N ( 0 R I I 1 ). The score for each factor was calculated by summing up the scores given to it by the parti cipants. The value of the RII ranged from 0 to 1. The value closest to 1 was ranked as the main barrier to influenza vaccination as compared to the others. 2.3.5. Inferential Statistics A Shapiro - Wilk normality test was applied to determine the nature of the data dis- tribution of the KAP score . Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to analyze relationship among the k nowledge, attitude, and p ractice s cores. A Whitney U - test (Wil- cox rank - sum t est) was used to determine the statistically significant difference between the two independent groups , Kruskal - Wallis t est was used to determine statistically sig- nificant di fference s in three or more independent groups. A p - v alue < 0.05 was considered significant , and a p - value < 0.01 was considered highly significant. A Fischer exact test was applied to identify the significant factors hindering influenza vaccination. A p - value < 0.05 was considered significant , and * marks highly significant results. The Fisher e xact test was conducted between influenza vaccination in the last 6 - 12 months (Ye s, No) and for barriers to influenza vaccination (SDA, DA, N , A, SA). 3. Results 3.1. Socio - Demographic Characteristics of Respondents The socio - d emographic characteristics of the respondents are described i n detail in Table 1. The study revealed that over half of the respondents were female nurses ( 54.1 % ), followed by physicians ( 45.2 % ) . The majority of the ( ) were fe- males , . Most re spondents ( 80% ) were young adult female s , whil e the fewest respondents came from the age ranges of 31 - 35 years and over 35 years. In addition , only 23 (19.7%) male HCPs and 60 (21.2%) female HCPs had a history of in- fluenza vaccination in the past 6 - 12 months. Table 1.

Health Care Professionals ' Knowledge about Influenza Vaccination Regarding knowledge of HCPs about influenza vaccination , 85.5% HCPs had re- sponded that the \"influenza vaccine is effective in pre venting the 'flu\", while 75.8% also responded that the World Health Organization (WHO) give s the recommendation on in- fluenza vaccination of h ealth p rofessionals. Moreover, a majority ( 43% ) of the respondents were aware of the guidelines published by the WHO Advisory Committee on Immuniza- tion Practices (ACIP) for influenza immunization. About 60.5% of participants had a per- ception that vaccination did not provide 100% protection against the flu. A total of 83% HCPs knew that they can tran smit influenza to the ir patients ( Table 2) . Most of the respondents ( 67% ) had a high level of knowledge ( 75% ), and 33% re- spondents had a low level of knowledge , having scores of <75% , (Table 3 ). Table 2.

Health Care Professionals ' Attitude towards Influenza Vaccination Among all enrolled participants, 63.7% agreed that vaccine s are effective at prevent- ing influenza. Over half of the respondents (52%) believed that vaccination lowers the risk of hospitalization and death. More than half of respondents ( 60.7% ) thought that the vac- cine may decrease the days of illness with influenza. The response to items in the ques- tionnaire showed that the majority of the respondents agreed with the statement s that vaccinating healthcare personnel protects patients ( 54.7% ) and those h ealthcare personnel ( 40.2% ) should get vaccinated against influenza every year. A pproximately 51.5% of re- spondents believed that the i nfluenza vaccine should be part of r outine medical practice (Table 4 ). The scores related to the attitude of respondents are summarized (Table 3 ). It was found that more than half ( 65.5% ) of the respondents had a positive attitude (total score > mean) towards influenza vaccination, and 34.5% of respondents had a negative attitude (total Score < mean ) towards influenza vaccination Table 4 .

Health Care Professionals ' Practice Regarding Influenza Vaccination Most respondents ( 51% ) had a good practice regarding influenza vaccination, wh ere 49% of respondents had poor practice regarding influenza vaccination (Table 3 ). The respondents practice with respect to influenza vaccination was determined in this study ( Table 5 ) , and it was found that 35.5% the HCPs rarely go to a health facility when they have signs of a cough, cold, and /or sore throat. Moreover, most respondents ( 36.2% ) wear mask s when having signs of a cough and /or cold. However, only 23.2% of the respondents received the influenza vaccin e frequently, while 44.2% of the HCPs never received the influenza vaccine on regular basis. Table 5 .

On the other hand , 13% showed low knowledge, positive attitude , and poor prac- tice, while 11% showed high knowledge, negative attitude , and good practice. In addition , 8% showed low knowledge, negative attitude, and poor practice, while the other 8% showed low knowledge, nega tive attitude , and poor practice. The study also showed that 7% showed h igh knowledge, negative attitude , and poor practice . , O nly 4% of the re- spondents showed l ow knowledge, positive attitude , and good practice ( Figure 2 ).

Health Care Professionals ' Knowledge, Attitude , and Practice Score Regarding Influenza Vaccination against Gender, Age, Education, Profession , and Job Experience The current study revealed a highly significant difference in knowle dge ( p = 0.000), attitude ( p = 0.000) , and practice ( p = 0.000) according to gender . it indicated that female s had a high level of knowledge, positive attitude , and good practice as compared to male s . There w ere also highly significant difference s in knowledge ( p = 0.000) and practice ( p = 0.008) as per age, but there were no statistical difference s in attitude ( p = 0.94) . T hese re- sults showed that respondents 2 1 - 25 years old ha ve high level s of knowledge, positive attitude , and good practice compa red to other age groups. O n the other hand , the re- spondents' at titude ( p = 0.638) did not show a statistically significant differenc e among p rofession s . The study further showed that respondents having 1 - 2 years of working ex- perience had a high level of knowledge , However working experience was not statistically different attitude ( p = 0.915) and practice ( p = 0.241) re spondents ( Table A1 ) ( see Appen- dix A). 3.8. Barrie rs to Influenza Vaccination Wh en exploring the HCPs ' justification/barriers for not being vaccinated against in- fluenza, about 30.5% agreed that there is a lack of proper storage area for vaccination. However, the majority ( 37.3% ) disagreed with the statement that influenza vaccine is not compulsory for HCPs. About 55.5% stated that not everyone was familiar with the avail- ability of influenza vaccination at their institution. Furthermore , 9 barriers out of 11 were highly significant by the Fisher exact test ( p = 0.000 ) . In addition , elative I mportance I ndex (RII), barriers were categorized from most important to least important. When finding a score of RII = 0.760 , not everyone was familiar with the availability of vaccine s at their institute , and this was categorized as t he number - one barrier. Further- more, insufficient staff to administer vaccine s ( RII = 0.649 ) was ranked as the number two barrier. Further detail s are given in ( Table A2) (see Appendix A) . 4. Discussion Influenza is a highly contagious disease , and HCPs are at a higher risk of becom ing infected and also serve as carrier s , transmit ting influenza to their patients. Influenza vac- cination is the most - effective method for the prevention of influenza virus infection and its associated complications. This study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude, practice , and barriers regarding influenza vaccination among HCPs . Knowledge, attitude , and practice are aspects that represent behavioral domain . It is well understood that knowledge and attitude can have an impact on an individual's prevention practices [ 26 ] . Published studies show that vaccinating HCPs against influenza is an effective interven- tion for preventing infections, reducing transmission to patients, and lowering mortality and morbidity among vulnerable groups. Vaccination also reduces absenteeis m an d im- proves HCPs ' health [ 12 ] . D espite ACIP and CDC recommendations and HCPs being at higher risk of infection, this study found low rates of influenza vaccination (20.75%) among health care professionals in Lahore, Pakistan. These findings are consistent with earlier published research findings of lower rate of influenza vaccination among HCPs. Furthermore, the current study's influenza vaccination rate among HCPs is likely the low- est when compared to the available literature from different regions of the world, namely Kuwait (67.2%), Om an (46.6%), The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia(KSA) (38.0%), Fra nce Vaccines 2023 , 11 , 136 11 of 16 (30.6%) , and The United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) (24.7%) [ 27 ] . The low rate of influenza vac- cination among HCPs in Lahore, Pakistan , is likely related to the unfamiliarity of vaccine availability, cost of the va ccine , and some concerns/ belief s about influenza vacc ination. Various socio - demographic factors , e.g. , age, gender, marital status , and education level , have been found to be associated with vaccine hesitancy during the pandemics of HINI- pdm09 and COVID - 19 [28 - 30 ] . In our study , vaccine hesitancy was frequent in young people (age 2 1 - 30 ) com pared to older age (>3 0 years). As per WHO, the rational model of health promotion assume s that high knowledge would translate to a positive attitude and, as a result , lead to good behavior ; however , in reality, the transition is not straightforward an d is depen dent on a number of factors [ 31 ] . In this regard, the study compared distri- bution s of respondents by composite knowledge, attitude , and practice performance. In our study , 28% had a positive rating on the KAP score, while 7% had a negative rating on the KAP score . However, more than half who were in various categories required inter- ventions to improve knowledge, attitude , and practice regarding influenza vaccination. In our study , the majority of the respondents ( 48. 7% ) kn e w that vaccination should be administered every year and were also aware of the WHO guidelines ' recommend ation for influenza vaccination. Similarly , in earlier published studies, HCPs understood that they were included in the high - risk group and sho uld be vaccinated annually. They knew WHO guidelines for influenza vaccination. Further HCPs also understood that their role in disease transmission and that vaccination helps to stop the spread of infection to others [ 32 , 33 ] . The summation of th is attitude revealed that most HCPs ( 65.5% ) had a positive attitude toward influenza vaccination. This could be due to the high level of knowledge of health care professionals. These results correspond to a study in which 67% had a pos- itive attitude towards influenza vaccina tion [ 34 ] . These results are also consistent with a study con ducted by Mojamamy et al. [ 35 ] . Health care professionals are exposed to nu- me rous infections and diseases given their nature of work. Hence , the current study re- vealed some preventive strategies used by HCPs . Most respondents ( 36.2% ) frequently wore mask , and 46.2% washed their hand s very frequently. Hand washing is a key step to prevent cross - infections at health care facilit ies . S ummation of practice score s revealed that most HCPs ( 51% ) had good practice regarding influenza vaccination. The result of the current study indicated a hi gh level of knowledge and a positive attitude , which ulti- mately lead to good practice. These positive KAP scores are important for the prevention and control of influenza and other associated complications. These results are also con- sistent with a study co n ducted by Mojamamy et al. [ 35 ] , which showed that 58% of the respondents had a positive practice. The result s of the current study revealed the highly significant difference in knowledge ( p = 0.000), attitude ( p = 0.000) , and practice ( p = 0.000) according to gender and indicated that female s had high level of knowledge, a positive attitude , and a good practice as compared to male s . Female s show ed more concern and response towards influenza as compared to male s, which shows a great difference be- twe en them. These results contradict a previous study in which male doctors possessed better knowledge (8.05 \u00b1 1.39, p = 0.003) than fe male doctors [ 12 ] . Further, t he study showed respondents having 1 - 2 years of work experience and high level s of knowledge ( p 0.001) , work experience was not statistically different according to the attitude ( p = 0.915) and practice ( p = 0.241) of the respondents. These results are similar to a study wherein new graduates, with 1 - 2 years of job experience, had significantly ( p = <0.001* ) better knowledge com par ed to others [ 19 ] . In our study , the top - ranked barrier to influ- enza vaccination among HCPs was that not everyone was familiar with the availability of the vaccine at their institute ( RII = 0.760 ) . Similarl y, a study conducted by Khan et al. in Pakistan [ 19 ] reported the top - ranked barrier to vaccination ( RIWF = 0.71 ) among HCPs to be a lack of awareness of the availability at their institute. These results are similar to a study conducted by James et al. in Sierra Le one [ 36 ] . This may be due to the lack of orien- tation programs and public health activities at the hospitals , which may reduce the health care professionals ' interest in investigating the availability of such services at their insti- tutes. In this study , the other barriers found to influenza vaccination were a lack of proper Vaccines 2023 , 11 , 136 12 of 16 storage, a lack of sufficient staff to administer the vaccine, side effects and safety concern s , the cost of the vaccine, doubts about the effectiveness of the vaccine , and the fear of nee- dle s . Similarly , earlier previous studies have also reported these barriers amo ng health care professionals [ 12 , 19 , 37 , 38 ] . In Pakistan , the majority of HCPs are Muslim, and they have some concerns and belief s about whether vaccines are \" halal \" or not. Regarding the affordability of vaccine s, one of the barrier s is the cost of the vaccine (influvac tetra) , which is about USD 8.8431 in 1989 PKR s. Due to the high cost , most of the HCPs were not con- cerned with this . Cost effectiveness is crucial for the acceptance of a vaccine. The Health Minist ry of Punjab in Pakistan has ensured the availability of the influenza vaccine by reducing the cost of the influenza vaccine at their institute , which encourages health pro- fessionals to get vaccinated [ 37 ] . The findings of the current study could help devise an immunization policy for HCPs in Pakistan by the Health Ministry. The Health Ministry of Punjab, Pakistan , shou ld en- sure the availability of influenza vaccine s at each health care facility free of cost to HCPs to avoid hesitancy related to the high cost of the influenza vaccine. This will help the HCPs maintain their health and stop the spread of such diseases to t heir patients. Furthermore, educational seminars and awareness campaigns should be arranged for HCPs . The limitation of our study is that the results cannot be generalized to all HCPs in Pakistan, as this study only included HCPs from Lahore, Punjab. Anoth er limitation is, at the time of the design, it was not comprehended by the investigator that the option of \"don't know\" could affect the validity of the study. We recommend excluding the \"don't know\" option from the response for the section about the know ledge of influenza vac- cination , as i t might affect the validity of study. 5. Conclusions In the current study , more than half of HCPs show ed a high level of knowledge, a positive attitude , and a good practice regarding influenza vaccination . Despite the posi- tive KAP scores, and published guidelines and recommendations, a very low percentage of HCPs in our hospitals were vaccinated against i nfluenza. Unfamiliarity with vaccine availability, in sufficient staff to administer the vaccine, side eff ects and safety concern s , cost of the vaccine, doubts on the effectiveness of the vaccine , and the fear of needle s were some of the main barriers to influenza vaccination. These barriers should be ruled out by using various strategies such as arranging awa reness , educational seminars , and sessions about vaccinations. Author Contribution s: Con ceptualization, G .
