We put together this quick guide to show you why munchrooms just might be the perfect plant-based snack. | | Mushrooms 101: Once known as \"food of the gods\" by early Romans, mushrooms have long been part of human civilization. Some experts say that the taste of mushrooms belongs to a fifth flavor - beyond sweet, sour, salty, and bitter - known as \"umami\", from the Japanese word meaning delicious. Mushrooms have been used to boost energy, immunity and improve overall health. With strong adaptogenic properties, mushrooms are anti-aging, gut health boosting, inflammation reducing, and immune system stimulating. | | Magical healing powers? Mushrooms are now being increasingly researched and used for their important health benefits with different varieties having different medicinal properties. As a great source of protein and fiber, mushrooms also contain B vitamins and a powerful antioxidant called selenium, which helps to support the immune system and prevent damage to cells and tissues. \"They are excellent for immune system-supportive and antioxidant properties,\" says Erica Steele, N.D., a functional medicine practitioner. \"Many of them have potent antiviral and anti-tumor properties, while some support metabolic and inflammatory conditions such as hypertension and cholesterol.\" | | An easy way to help the earth? In addition to being good for you, mushrooms are also good for the planet! | | 1. Increased Satiety Shiitake mushrooms contain soluble dietary fiber, such as -glucan, which produce satiety and reduce food intake. Studies also show that -glucan can lower cholesterol. Thus, it is an ideal food to help curb cravings and support overall digestive health. | | 2. Antioxidants Selenium is an antioxidant which can be found in shiitake mushrooms. Antioxidants help prevent damage to cells caused by free radicals and fight oxidative stress. Selenium plays a critical role in keeping thyroid function and metabolism in a healthy balance. | | 3. Supports bone health Certain mushrooms, including shiitake mushrooms, are the ONLY un-fortified plant-based foods that naturally contain high levels of vitamin D. Vitamin D helps to maintain and regulate healthy calcium levels in the body, which supports bone health. Hence, shiitake mushroom acts as a superb natural supplement. Many vegans find it an essential addition to their nutrition plan. | | 4. Immunity boosting Shiitake mushroom also includes 7 of the 8 essential amino acids required for optimal health in humans. A lack of amino acids can impair immune function. These delicious mushrooms contain enough amino acids, vitamin D and selenium to keep your immune system strong, helping your body fight off inflammation and disease.
