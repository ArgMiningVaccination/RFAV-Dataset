While you enjoy being a mother, you're often worried about your baby's frequent infections and problems. Let's take a look at some of the most common problems in infants and the ways to address them. While a lot of these problems are not serious and can be treated at home, as a new parent, especially if you're living in a nuclear family, you may find it difficult to handle them on your own. In this case, instead of getting worried, you can always consult a doctor. Colic Is your child crying so incessantly that you have trouble taking even a short nap. Or are you finding it difficult to even understand why the baby is crying? Most often chances are high that they might be suffering from colic. The condition is attributed to [gastroesophageal reflux](https://www.narayanahealth.org/blog/gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/). It is caused when acidic contents of the stomach are regurgitated into the baby's oesophagus. If your child is crying continuously even past the age of three months, you have reasons to suspect it as a case of colic. It's always better to consult a doctor. The doctor may suggest smaller, more frequent feedings, medication, etc. Cold & Flu Infants have delicate immune system. It means that their chances of contracting infection such as cold and flu from their surroundings are quite high. If you find symptoms of cold and flu in your child such as running nose, coughing, sneezing, etc., make sure that you consult a doctor without delay. If left untreated, a simple cold or flu can cause pneumonia in young children. The doctor may recommend medicine for flu and cold, which is safe for infants. Under any circumstances, don't administer medicines to children without seeking a doctor's advice. Ear Infections Yet another common infection in children, ear infection makes them extremely uncomfortable. Normally infants with an [ear infection](https://www.narayanahealth.org/blog/my-toddler-has-ear-pain-and-couldnt-sleep-at-night/), tug on their ears, refuse to lie down or cry incessantly. Ear infection is caused by the accumulation of germy fluids in the ear, pressing against the eardrum. Your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic that will clear the infection quickly and end your child's discomfort. Constipation It's quite common in children below the age of 1 year to have constipation. Often, this is the result of a change in their diet. It's during the first year children are introduced to new diets that comprise solid foods. This result is inconsistent bowel movements. There are a number of home remedies to solve the problem. One such is changing the diet itself. If you find the presence of blood in their diaper, don't delay seeing a doctor. Also, if the problem of constipation persists even after you make changes in their [diet](https://www.narayanahealth.org/blog/importance-of-balanced-diet-for-a-healthy-lifestyle/), consult your doctor. It could be the result of an underlying health condition. Diarrhoea It's just the opposite of constipation - frequent bowel movements which are watery. This can be caused by an array of factors including food allergy, a bacterial infection or medication. Diarrhoea can dehydrate your child and hence it's necessary to seek a doctor's advice. Also, if the stool is bloody, make sure that you bring it to the notice of the paediatrician. Your infant's ailments can be worrying, but with a good paediatrician to rely on, you can stay relaxed. If your child is showing any signs or symptoms of a disease, always seek doctor's help. [Dr. Balaji "}
