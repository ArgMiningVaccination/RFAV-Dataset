I always focus my care on finding the ways to enhance each person's vital force: their individual, inherent power to heal.\" - Dr. Judy What Is Naturopathic Medicine? Your body contains within it the potential for remarkable healing, and with the right natural therapies and guidance, you can strengthen and draw from this source of power for self-healing. Naturopathic medicine is based on this self-healing ability. Because of this, naturopathic doctors teach their patients to use diet, exercise, lifestyle changes and cutting edge natural therapies to enhance their bodies' ability to prevent and combat disease, as well as blend the best of modern medical science and traditional natural medical approaches to not only treat disease, but to also restore health. At its core, naturopathic medicine is comprised of six timeless principles founded in medical tradition and scientific evidence. 1. LET NATURE HEAL Our bodies have such a powerful, innate instinct for self-healing. By finding and removing the barriers to this self-healing\u2014such as poor diet or unhealthy habits\u2014naturopathic physicians can nurture this process. 2. IDENTIFY AND TREAT CAUSES Naturopathic physicians understand that symptoms will only return unless the root illness is addressed. Rather than cover up symptoms, they seek to find and treat the cause of these symptoms. 3. DO NO HARM Naturopathic physicians use low-risk procedures and healing compounds\u2014such as dietary supplements, herbal extracts and homeopathy\u2014with few or no side effects. They feel that whenever it's possible, you should not suppress symptoms as these are the body's efforts to self-heal. 4. EDUCATE PATIENTS Naturopathic medicine believes that doctors must be educators, as well as physicians.That is why naturopathic physicians teach their patients nutrition, relaxation techniques, body physiology and how to nurture themselves physically and emotionally. They also encourage self-responsibility and work closely with each patient to achieve their health goals. 5. TREAT THE WHOLE PERSON We each have a unique physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social and spiritual makeup. The naturopathic physician knows that all these factors affect our health and carefully tailors each treatment strategy around the individual's unique makeup. 6. PREVENT ILLNESS Proactive medicine saves money, pain, misery and lives, by supporting a healthy lifestyle. That is why naturopathic physicians evaluate risk factors, heredity, and vulnerability to disease when treating each and every patient. \"I have been Dr. Judy's patient for two years now and I have never encountered a doctor who takes such a personal and caring approach to treating her patients!\" \u2014ANGELA Our Team DR.
