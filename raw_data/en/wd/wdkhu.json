The Ministry of Health in Chile (MINSAL) has recognized and regulated some CAM, although there is still unknown their effectiveness and safety of these. Objective: Review the available evidence regarding the use of CAM in adolescents with the attention deficit hyperacti- vity syndrome (ADHD) and mood disorders. Methodology: A review of the related literature about this topic on PubMed, focus on the last 10 years and using as a keywords Complementary/Alternative Medicine/Therapies, Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, Mood disorders, and Children/Ado- lescents. The revision was also complemented with other sources of information. Results: Globally there has been a progressive increase in publications in relation to the CAM. However, not all studies follow a good methodology and the majority of the studies in adolescents show inconclusive results. The ADHD studies have shown benefits when using omega 3 fatty acids. Regarding other CAM and ADHD, the evidence does not show any favorable results beyond placebo. Though some of these stu- dies have methodological mistakes or lack of enough studies, making it impossible to have conclusi- ve. In mood disorders, there are several promising therapies, such as: physical exercise, light therapy, St. John's Wort and some kinds of meditation like Mindfulness. In Chile, there are still no studies in this age group, which makes important the development of a line of research in this area. Introduction Complementary/Alternative Medicine (CAM) are increasingly used by patients, including children and adolescents. There are different types of CAM, being the vast majority of low cost and easy access1. The main reasons for their use are dissatisfaction with conventio-nal medicine and the positive effect they have had on family and friends 1. Gradually, different CAM have been incorporated review arTicle 293into health systems, and more professionals are practi- cing them. However, the effectiveness of many of them is still unclear. Over the last few years, there has been a considera- ble increase in publications in this area. In 1991, there were published 2260 articles related to CAM. On the contrary, in 2011 this figure reached 9441 2. The objective of this article is to carry out a review of the available scientific evidence regarding the use of CAM in adolescents with ADHD and mood disorders and the situation in our country, in order to provide professionals with an updated vision of the effective-ness and safety of CAM. Methodology The bibliographic search was performed in Pub- Med by conjugating the terms MESH, \"Complemen-tary therapies\", disorder with hyperactivity\" and \"mood disor-ders\", with limits of English and Spanish language, published between January 2004 and August 2015. In addition, the search was extended to references. The selected papers were complemented with other sources of information considered relevant. It was also sear-ched the information onthe official website of the Chi-lean Ministry of Health (www.minsal.cl) 3. Concepts in alternative medicine Many times, there is confusion with the different terms used, such as traditional and non-traditional medicine, complementary and alternative, conventio-nal or integrative, etc. The World Health Organization (WHO) con- ceptualizes traditional medicine as \"the total sum of knowledge and practices based on theories and ex-periences inherent to the different cultures, whether explicable or not, and which are used in the mainte-nance of health or in the prevention and treatment of diseases\" 4,5. For example, traditional Chinese medici- ne, Tibetan medicine or Ayurveda in India, Mapuche medicine in Chile, etc. 6. Conventional medicine is medicine considered as official or allopathic. Complementary medicine is the one used together with conventional medicine. Alternative medicine is the one used instead of conventional medicine. Finally, there is the concept of integrative medicine, with a comprehensive approach of the patient. Both, the conventional Physician and the CAM therapist, know the therapy indicated by the other and they work together as a team. In this case, CAM is integrated into the conventional health system 6,7. The Cochrane Collaboration defines CAM as a \"broad set of therapeutic resources that includes all systems, modalities, health practices, theories and be-liefs that accompany them, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particu-lar society in a given historical period data\" 4,6. Epidemiology A 2007 survey by the NCCIH (National Center for Complementary and Integral Health) showed that the most common CAM in children are natural products (17.7%), with echinacea and fish oil being the most used by adolescents (37.2% and 30.5%, respectively). Body/Mind Therapies occupied the second place, with therapies like deep breathing (12.7%) and medita-tion (9.4%); Followed by chiropractic and osteopathy (8.6%) and massages (8.3%) 7,8. Situation in Chile In 1992, the Ministry of Health of Chile (Minsal) created the \"Unit of Traditional Medicine and Other Alternative Medical Practices\" 9. In 2005, Decree N\u00b042 of the Health Code is dictated, which regulates the practice of alternative (complementary) medical practices as auxiliary health professions. So far, Acu-puncture has been recognized (Decree N\u00b0 123 of 2008); Homeopathy (Decree N\u00b0 19 of 2010) and Naturopathy (Decree N\u00b0 5 of 2013) 3. At the public health level, CAM are being develo- ped in both, primary care centers and hospitals, with 34.5% of establishments and 54% of the therapists in these places are health professionals. In 2010, the Minsal conducts the first national sur- vey of CAM, in charge of the Center of Studies of Ci-tizen Opinion of the University of Talca. 2071 CAM therapists were surveyed 11. The most practiced 14.4%. Many CAM therapists practiced more than one type of therapy 11. Within the profile of the CAM therapist, 92.1% of the therapists had a higher education and/or professio-nal technicians. Of these, only 37% corresponded to titles related to the health area (psychologists [9.6%] and health technicians [8.7%]). Among professions not related to health, the most frequent were teachers (8.8%). Of the 418 training entities mentioned in the survey, only 5.2% of professional institutes and/or uni-Family Physician, specialist in children - M. P. P\u00e9rez carmonareview arTicle 294versity technicians are recognized by Ministry of Edu- cation11. Regarding the use of CAM, 55% of Chileans have used at least one type of CAM during their lifetime, regardless of age, sex, socioeconomic status, and fore-sight. As for the reasons for consultation, the most fre- quent are emotional problems (56%), pain (26%), depression (24.8%) and stress (14.6%). 80.8% of the patients come to the therapist referred by another pa-tient with CAM. In the case of physical ailments, the most common CAM were Acupuncture, Apitherapy, Chiropractic, Neural Therapy and Biomagnetism. In the diagnosis made in 2012, in relation to the re- sults of CAM therapies, the greatest achievements were the reduction of symptoms (19%), disease mitigation and/or remission (18.6%) and quality improvement of life and well-being (11.3%) 10. To date, there are no studies of CAM use in adoles- cent population in Chile. There is concern about Min-sal and research lines are being developed, for example in Floral Therapy and ADHD. CAM and adolescents The prevalence in children and adolescents of CAM use is between 20 and 40%, being greater than 50% in patients with chronic diseases (asthma, ADHD, autism, cancer, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, inflam-matory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis youth) 12. The main reasons for adolescents to use CAM are: word of mouth; why a particular treatment is conside-red effective, fears of the adverse effects of drugs, dissa-tisfaction with conventional medicine and the need for more personal attention 12. The use of CAM is more frequent in children whom parents have used CAM. By contrast, adoles-cents are more open than their parents to these types of therapies 12. Around 66% of parents/caregivers do not advise the pediatrician that they are using some type of CAM in parallel 12, which reflects the importance of asking about their use, since some may have interactions or adverse effects when used together with other thera-pies. In 2007, the National Health Interview Survey NHI NCCAM surveyed 5651 adolescents with ADHD, anxiety and depression (representing 7 million young people). In this group of patients, the use of CAM was 28.9% versus 11.6% of the general population (p < 0.05). When comparing both groups of patholo-gies, it was observed that 34.8% of patients with anxie-ty/depression used some type of CAM versus 24.7% of patients with ADHD (p < 0.05). The CAM most used by these patients were: Therapies mind/body (16.3%), Biological therapies (11%), Therapies based on body manipulation (8.5%) 13. In this study, we also studied factors related to the use of CAM; Where the highest educational level of the parents was positive OR: 3.04 [1.7-5.26], have another chronic of medi-cal prescriptions OR: difficulty paying consultation Mental health OR: 2.63 [1.35-5.11] 13. A German review of the use of CAM in adolescents conducted a search for published studies between 1995 and 2012. There were found 4875 studies, of which 1379 were studies in children, of these 170 were cho-sen, of which 35 were excluded because they used some kind of conventional therapy. Finally, 135 studies met inclusion criteria. The 57% of the studies selected were conducted in England, Australia and China. The most common CAMs in adolescents were herbs, homeo-pathy, reflexology, and acupuncture 14. Of these 135 studies, 3.7% (5/135) concluded a rec- ommendation in favor of the intervention with CAM, 19.4% made a positive conditional recommendation; 6.6% (9/135) recommended that certain interventions should not be performed. It is striking that 70.3% of the studies were inconclusive 14. Similar results have been found in other studies15. It was also observed that the proportion of un- concluded studies has been increasing in recent times, being 55.6% between 1995-2000; and 73.4% between 2007 and 2012 14. When analyzing the main reasons for the deficien- cies of these studies and the high percentage of incon-clusive studies, it was seen that in 60.7% more stud-ies were necessary; 42.2% were of low methodological quality; 35.6% had a small number of patients and in 21.5% the data were insufficient 14. Regarding the types of CAM studies in children and adolescents, a review by Snyder et al, selected 111 studies published in Pubmed during 2011. The most studied pathologies were pain, headache, ADHD, asthma and colic. The majority of the studies corre-sponded to reviews, case reports and studies of low methodological quality. It was observed that the most frequent CAM used in children and Adolescents were the herbs (28%), within this group the observational studies were 29%, RCTs 26% and systematic reviews (observa-tional 17%, RCT 45% and systematic reviews 9% (systematic reviews 20% and 40% of RCT); Chiropractic with 5% (only one study of good methodological quality was found); Fi- nally, homeopathy with 5% (only studies of low meth-odological quality) 16. Hunt et al., selected 20 systematic reviews pub- lished in 2009 related to CAM and children. Some Family Physician, specialist in children - M. P. P\u00e9rez carmonareview arTicle 295examples of the results of this study point out that in acupuncture we found 24 RCTs, observing benefits in the management of post-surgery, nausea and vomit-ing. In chiropractic, there was insufficient evidence. Within the medicinal herbs, two studies were found with Echinacea for cold management, one in favor and another that did not show significant differences. With regard to homeopathy, there were 2 systematic reviews with beneficial results regarding the manage-ment of diarrhea in children and in ADHD, although it must be considered that the 3 studies on the man-agement of diarrhea with homeopathy incorporated in the systematic review analyzed were performed by the same author of the review. In ADHD, 2 of the 3 RCTs showed positive results. A systematic review of hypnosis, which included 13 RCTs, showed consis-tent evidence of effectiveness in managing pain re-lated to pediatric procedures. In relation to massages, two Cochrane reviews have shown effectiveness in the promotion of mental and physical health, but in chil-dren younger than 6 months. Finally, with respect to yoga we selected a systematic review that included 24 RCTs, 6 RCTs showed improved memory and con-centration. However, it was difficult to obtain con-clusions, due to the heterogeneity of the studies, the different techniques of yoga used and the lack of rigor of the designs used 17. ADHD and mood disorders In the clinical care of adolescent patients, it is com- mon to find that in our country CAM are frequently used in pathologies such as ADHD and mood disor-ders Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Often parents of young people with ADHD do not want to use psychostimulant drugs for fear of being labeled, adverse effects or belief that they will beco-me \"addicted\", so they look for other alternatives as treatment, within which is CAM. In adolescents with ADHD, the use of nutritional supplements is 10% more likely than in adolescents without ADHD 18. A review published by Bloch & Mulqueen on the use of nutritional supplements in the treatment of ADHD published in 2014 concluded that the use of omega-3 fatty acids (dose 1 to 2 g/day) had evidence level 1 support (based on systematic reviews of RCT). The use of melatonin was categorized as level 2 of evidence (based on RCT studies), demonstrating effi-cacy in the management of sleep disorders related to ADHD, but without clinical improvement in relation to the symptoms of ADHD. The use of supplements with minerals such as zinc and iron has shown benefits in patients with deficits of these nutrients (level 3 of evidence). They have found some studies that report some improvement with the use of pycnogenol (pro-duct derived from pine bark) and with ningdong (gra-nules that are used in traditional Chinese medicine); however, their mechanisms of action are unknown and other studies are lack of credibility 19. With regard to St. John's wort, L-carnitine and gynko biloba, there is no evidence to support its use in these patients and their use is discouraged becau-se of the potential adverse effects these products could cause 19. Other CAM have not demonstrated their useful- ness in the management of adolescents with ADHD, such as Acupuncture. A Cochrane review published in 2011, where an extensive search was conducted in several databases, did not find quality studies to be in-cluded in the review of this topic 20. Regarding to Bach Flowers and ADHD, there is no scientific evidence to show that it is superior to place-bo. A systematic review on the use of floral therapy in different pathologies, included a study where the use of Bach flowers in 40 patients between 7 and 11 years with ADHD was analyzed, the use of Rescue Remedy was evaluated for 3 months and the use of Conner's test to evaluate changes. There were no significant differences regarding the use of placebo, it can be considered that the study had a 42% loss 21. In general, conclusions about the effectiveness of meditation therapies for ADHD have not been esta-blished. In a 2010 Cochrane review there were no sig-nificant differences between meditation and standard treatment, however the number of studies was limited (only 4 studies) and the size of small samples, having a high risk of bias. The adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. Further testing is needed 22. Mood Disorders The use of CAM antidepressants is becoming more frequent, since they are cheaper, with fewer adverse effects (except St. John's wort) and generate fewer stig-mas. A review done in 2014 by Popper, analyzed the evidence for the use of CAM in mood disorders in adolescents. 5 RCTs showed benefits of physical exer-cise for these patients, with an SMD effect size of 0.6 (p = 0.03). However, too much exercise could facilitate certain types of psychopathology 23. Light therapy, in several studies (4 RCTs and 4 open clinical trials), has shown a positive effect on mood symptoms in patients with seasonal depression and using bright light in the box. Although more stu-dies are needed given the small number of patients in-cluded 23.Family Physician, specialist in children - M. P. P\u00e9rez carmonareview arTicle 296St. John's wort has effects at the level of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, and has shown bene- fits in the treatment of depression23. This herb induces cytochrome p450, so be aware of the potential adverse effects (similar to other SSRIs and Sd. Serotonergic, among others) and interactions with other medicines, in this sense it is important to warn the Adolescents women use this herb in conjunction with oral contra-ceptives, which could have a decrease in their effecti-veness 24,25. In relation to body/mind therapies, a type of min- dfulness meditation has shown beneficial effects in different types of pathologies, such as handling stress, depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, among others. Various studies have shown changes at the neurobiological level and no adverse effects have been reported with this type of practice 24. Analysis of evidence available In the current literature, worldwide, there is a great deal of evidence (especially in the last 10 years) that supports CAM studies with methodological rigor (poor design, insufficient samples, biases, inconclusive results) and those that are well designed do not conclu-de results that support the effectiveness of the different CAM. CAM studies often analyze several types of in- terventions at the same time, making it impossible to know the actual effect of each of them separately. Neither the adherence to each therapy over time nor the adverse effects or interactions that may have with other types of therapies or drugs are reported. Each year, more CAM studies are published, but more studies are missing in the youth population. In this regard, it is important to have studies in Chile that evaluate the most used therapies in our country, since they do not necessarily coincide with therapies used in other countries, and evidence of good quality is needed to support their use. Some considerations to keep in mind is that not necessarily the use of CAM is synonymous with har-mless. Some therapies can have side effects. Also that the simultaneous is not always synergic (for example the use of St. John's Wort with anti-depressants IRSS), and finally the use of CAM will not always be of lower cost than the use of conventional medicine. It is essential, that there is regulation with respect to the production of supplements and herbs used as CAM. In our country, it is common that several pro-ducts are sold without supervision of the ISP or or-ganisms like the FDA. In this sense, it is important to have studies of efficacy, pharmacokinetics and cost-effectiveness that can help make decisions in public policies and that can demonstrate safety and efficacy of these products in the population. Another point to consider is the ethical-legal framework of these therapies, which has Been discussed in other countries. Discussion Increasingly, CAM are being used by more patients. This due to their accessibility, less expensive than con-ventional treatments, and promising results, which are often not supported by scientific evidence. These CAM respond to a set of needs that are not being met by current conventional medicine. It is cru-cial to reflect on the model of care we have been us-ing so far and the importance of being able to provide an integral model of care, with a more holistic view of the patient and his illness, which is what many of these therapies point out. It is necessary for professionals to ask their patients about the parallel use of these therapies, since the vast majorities do not spontaneously report the use of CAM, and in occasions they may have adverse effects or interactions with other treatments. The physician/pediatrician should have an educator role and be able to inform his/her patients about the use of CAM. When considering the use of CAM within the ther- apeutic arsenal, it is essential to make a risk analysis versus the benefit conferred by each therapy, and in turn, compared to conventional medicine, the qual-ity of the evidence that exists about it, adverse effects, among other. In this sense, every time we face an CAM it is essential to answer 3 questions: Is it safe? Is it effec-tive? Is it quality? In Chile, Minsal has been incorporating some CAM as auxiliary health professions. However, it is im-portant that there is a permanent regulation, both in clinical practice and in the professionals that exercise the different CAM, and in the institutions that teach this type of therapy. It is interesting to ask why CAM are generating so much impact in our society, which leads us to empha-size the importance of an integral model of care, en-compassing both physical, psychological/emotional, social and spiritual dimensions, in order to understand and respond in a better way to each adolescent and provide a safe, effective and quality care.
