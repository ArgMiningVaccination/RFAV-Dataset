Before the discovery of the cowpox vaccine inoculation with variolous matter\u2014known as variolation\u2014was the most widespread preventive against the disease. This practice was well established in parts of Asia and introduced to Europe by Mary Wortley Montagu from Constantinople in 1721. While variolation achieved some popularity\u2014particularly in Britain\u2014Edward Jenner's discovery of the cowpox vaccine in 1796 intensified the efforts to combat smallpox, and vaccination was introduced to large parts of the world within a few years. Although the spread of immunization against smallpox is commonly described as highly successful, the campaigns also represented an early encounter between an elitist state-sponsored medicine and various forms of popular resistance. - Type - Articles - Information [Medical History](/core/journals/medical-history), [Volume 48](/core/journals/medical-history/volume/ABDA1C31C0E75B3263929E5E22E2C86F), [Issue 2](/core/journals/medical-history/issue/24DC9897713D52EB99DA23B2F362E7C0), 01 April 2004 199 - 228 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2004 References 1 F F Cartwright, A social history of medicine, London, Longman, 1977, p. 92; Claudia Huerkamp, 'The history of smallpox vaccination in Germany: a first step in the medicalization of the general public', J. contemp.

Gyan Prakash, Another reason: science and the imagination of modern India, Princeton University Press, 1999, pp. 19-20. 7 Arnold, op. cit., note 5 above, p. 130. Arnold concludes that variolation was widespread in Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Orissa. It was also common around Varanasi (Benares), in parts of Punjab, in Rajasthan, Sindh, Gujarat and in scattered parts of Maharashtra and central India. 8 The Brahmans themselves were equally unclear about the introduction of variolation in the area. See a statement from four \"Woodiah\" Brahmans in British Library, Oriental and India Office Collections (hereafter BL-OIOC) F/4/96, Board's Collections no. 1953, fols 84-8. One observer claimed that variolation was practised by the Brahmans among the Worriahs, a brave, handsome, but less civilized tribe from the interior of the northern part of the Madras Presidency.

The lack of inoculators around Madras became apparent in the summer of 1802 during an outbreak of smallpox in the \"Black Town\", the crowded indigenous suburbs immediately outside Fort St George. 19 A letter from the government to the Medical Board, dated 23 Dec. 1802, in which they enquire about the quality of the \"Cow Pox lately introduced\" indicates the arrival of the vaccine at Madras. BL-OIOC F/4/153, Board's Collections no. 2613, fols 31-2. The vaccine might have arrived a few months earlier. Dominik Wujastyk writes that a boy was vaccinated and sent from Madras to Calcutta in October. Dominik Wujastyk, '\"A pious fraud\": the Indian claims for pre-Jennerian smallpox vaccination', in G J Meulenbeld and D Wujastyk (eds), Studies on Indian medical history, Groningen, Egbert Forsten, 1987, pp. vol. 13A, fols 501-2. 21 Proceedings of the 23 July 1804, entered with enclosures in: TNSA, Madurai DR vol. 1190, fol. 167. I only came across this reference to the continued use of variolation in south India and it is perhaps surprising that this report came from the southern part where variolation was not established before the British introduced it. The unreliability of early vaccination has been noted by a number of scholars. Harish Naraindas, 'Care, welfare and treason: the advent of vaccination in the 19th century', Contributions to Indian Sociology, 1998, n.s. 32: 67-96, p. 70. S Bhattacharya, M Harrison and M Worboys, Expunging variola: public health and the control and eradication of smallpox in India (forthcoming). 22 Arnold emphasizes that vaccination had its season, too. However, the evidence treated here indicates vaccination activities outside the period from December to March. Arnold, op. cit., note 5 above, p. 140. Losing the vaccine potency was particularly unfortunate, because cowpox was rare, if not entirely absent in India. For the contemporary view that cowpox did not exist naturally in India, see Ainslie, op. cit., note 8 above, p. 66. 23 OIOC F/4/153, Board's Collections no. 2613, fols 42-3, 60-3.

According to these figures vaccination began in September 1802. 25 For Bombay, see J Banthia and T Dyson, 'Smallpox in nineteenth-century India', Popul. Dev. Rev., 1999, 25: 649-80, fig. 2 on p. 658. The scheme adopted in Bengal was based on fixed vaccination stations and turned out to be very inefficient. The system initially adopted in Madras was based on itinerant vaccinators and seems to have resembled the much more successful system inaugurated in the Bombay Presidency in 1827 and later adopted in Madras in 1865. Arnold, op. cit., note 5 above, pp. 136, 144-5. The conclusions drawn from vaccination statistics must be taken to express broad tendencies only. For a warning against the reliability of vaccination statistics throughout the nineteenth century, see Bhattacharya, et al., op. cit., note 21 above. 26 A similar pattern has been found in Britain, where well-established variolation seems to have inhibited the dissemination of vaccination. Razzell, op. cit., note 2 above, pp. 77, 99-100. 27 TNSA, SGR vol. 14, fols 84-9. Proceedings of Medical Board, 21 May 1804, entered in: TNSA, Madurai DR 30 TNSA, SGR vol. 14, fol. 103.

The simplification was in large part due to the gradual adoption of the method developed by Robert and Daniel Sutton in the 1760s. 46 Kirkpatrick, op. cit., note 2 above, p. 301. Cf. Razzell, op. cit., note 2 above, pp. 12-13. 47 Baron Dimsdale, The present method of inoculating for the small-pox, 6th ed., London, W Owen, 1772, pp. 4, 78. It did occur to Dimsdale that the dietary preparation might be superflous, but he dared not \"by way of experiment, dispense with the use of measures that had been hitherto so successful\". Ibid., p. 82. See Kirkpatrick, op. cit., note 2, pp. 283-6, for similar considerations. Elaborate preparation of the patient lost importance in Britain in last decades of the eighteenth century. Razzell, op. cit., note 2 above, pp. 14-16. On the conceptual level, the attempt to keep the patient cold found a parallel in the Indian belief in Sitala. According to Susan Wadley, Sitala \"abhors heat and all things hot and she eats primarily stale (cold) food and other cool things\". Wadley, op. cit., note 40 above, p. 54. 48 Dimsdale, op. cit., note 47 above, pp. 23, 30, 33, 79-80. Kirkpatrick, op. cit., note 2 above, pp. 193, 329, 344. 49 Shoolbred, op. cit., note 39 above, p. 73. It is, however, not possible to establish an absolute distinction between an \"Indian\" and a \"British\" method. For references to Indians using fresh matter, see Nicholas, op. cit., note 40 above, p. 28. A rare example of storing variolous matter for years in Britain was reported from the Shetland Islands in 1792. Razzell, op. cit., note 2 above, p. 23. 50 While dried matter was stored from season to season in Bengal, Kirkpatrick only claimed that he had \"certain Demonstration\" that variolous matter could remain active for several weeks. Kirkpatrick op. cit., note 2 above, p. 211. Dimsdale's account conveys a similar impression: \"If neither an inoculated patient is at hand, nor anyone in the neighbourhood has a distinct kind of the natural disease, a thread may be used as in the common manner, provided that the thread be very recently infected; but I think it ought to be used as soon as possible after being charged with infecting matter.\" Dimsdale, op. cit., note 47 above, p. 29. 51 Proceedings of the Medical Board, 29 October 1804, entered with enclosures in: TNSA, Madurai DR, vol. 1190, fols 271-2. For references to the use of infected thread, see, for example, Shoolbred, op. cit. note 39, p. 45.

For an even more pronounced expression of the difference between Western and Indian conceptualizations of disease, see Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Apfell-Marglin, 'Smallpox in two systems of knowledge', WIDER Working Papers, 1987, No. 17. 57 Thompson, op. cit., note 43 above, p. 20. 58 Ibid, p. 21. 59 BL-OIOC P/255/53 4096-7. See also account printed in Indian Medical Gazette, Oct. 1902: 413-14. 60 Neither troops nor prisoners seem to have been subject to compulsory immunization. For the voluntary inoculation of troops, see, for example, TNSA, SGR vol. 12, fol. 261. In March 1802 the sub-collector of Bhovany wrote to the commanding officer at Erode that inoculation among prisoners ought to be encouraged but should rest \"upon the consent of the Natives themselves\". He further wished it to be understood that he took upon himself \"the responsibility of the bodily safety of the Prisoners\". TNSA, Coimbatore DR vol. 593, fols 70-1. I shall continue to use the the more idiomatic term \"resistance\" in the text. 61 BL-OIOC F/4/268, Board's Collections no. fol. 67. vol. 13A, fols 312-13. Anderson, op. cit., note 32 above, p. 18. 63 TNSA, Coimbatore DR vol. 592, fols 190-4; Proceedings of the Medical Board, 21 May 1804, with enclosures in: TNSA, Madurai DR, vol. 1190, fols 161, 163. 64 Paraiyans (or Pariah) refers to a numerous low ranking community of Tamils. Since there are no references to the non-Tamil equivalents of Paraiyans, the term probably refers to all low-ranking communities (approximately what would later be termed \"untouchables\" and even later \"harijans\" and \"dalits\"). 65 This is of course based on the assumption that immunizers from a specific group tended to practise within that group. 66 TNSA, SGR vol. 14, fol. F/4/96, Board's Collections no. 1953, fol. 98. Anderson, op. cit., note 32 above, p. 18. The Zamindar of Chintapilly had been variolated in the 1790s and subsequent vaccination would not have had any impact on his immunity. 68 TNSA, SGR vol. 14, fols 174-5. 69 Thus the Indian terms chosen for cowpox seem to have generated unfortunate connotations among Indians. Wujastyk, op. cit., note 19 above, pp. 152-3. BL-OIOC F/4/153, Board's Collections no. 2613, fols 125-6. In Europe, too, uncertainty about the relation between humans and an animal disease caused some anxiety. Cartwright, op. cit., note 1 above, p. 89. Eberhard Wolff, Massnahmen. Franz Steiner, 1998, pp. 442-4. 70 That popular resistance should be seen essentially as a political protest against the disciplinarian activities of the state has been suggested by Apffel-Marglin. This explanation seems, however, far too one-sided. Apffel-Marglin, op. cit., note 56 above, pp. 18, 76 Blackburne's letter was clearly utilized in the debate between Mackenzie and the Medical Board. 77 TNSA, Trichinopoly DR vol. 3661, fol. 159. TNSA, SGR vol. 14, fols 252-3. On smallpox as a divine possession, see Arnold, op. cit., note 5 above, p. 123. 78 BL-OIOC F/4/96, Board's Collection no. 1953, fols 2, 52: 66-82, pp. 72, 75, 79. 81 Wolff, op. cit., note 69 above, pp. 413-36.

The Zamindar referred to is the Zamindar of Chintapilly, and it is noteworthy that this circular did not even reveal that the Zamindar had been inoculated by a British surgeon. 85 Ibid., fol. 107. 86 F/4/96, Board's Collections no. 1953, fol. 43. 88 Proceedings of the Medical Board, 3 Apr. 1801, with enclosures entered Brahmins\" refers to the indigenous inoculators in the northern parts of the Presidency. 89 TNSA, Coimbatore DR vol. 592, fol. 194. 90 BL-OIOC F/4/96, Board's Collections no. 1953, fol. 50. 91 Arnold, op. cit., note 5 above, pp. 127-8, 139. 92 Proceedings of the Medical Board, 6 Apr. 1801, entered in: TNSA, Madurai DR vol. 1181, fol. 267. 93 Proceedings of the Medical Board, 6 Apr. 1801, with enclosures 97 This was, however, followed by a more specific reference to the fact that the vaccine emanated \"from a source sanctified by the several sacred Laws of their Hindoo Religion.\" Ibid., 1149, fols 94-5. 100 Wujastyk, op. cit., note 19 above. Also in the early decades of the nineteenth century, the British surgeon Thomas Coats in Poona composed a pamphlet, written in Marathi and in keeping with regional cultural idioms, which aimed to convince Indians of the benefits of vaccination. Coats did not, however, claim that vaccination had been known in India, but gave full credit to Jenner. Guha, op. cit., note 11 above, pp. 140-55. 101 The claim that vaccination was known in ancient India was of course consistent with the general \"orientalist\"\u2014and later also nationalist\u2014notions that located any scientific rationality which the Indians might have possessed in a remote golden age. See, for instance, Prakash, op. cit., note 6 above, pp. 86-117, 230. For a comparable attempt to locate scientific astronomy in ancient India, see ibid., pp. 71-2. 102 Ainslie, op. cit., note 8 above, p. 64. The attitude towards variolation was different in Bengal where it represented a mightier rival to vaccination. A report from 1850 depicted variolation as \"a murderous trade\". Arnold, op. cit., note 5 above, p. 138. 103 I have dealt with this issue more generally in 'Coming to terms with the native practitioner\u2014indigenous doctors in colonial service in South India 1800-1825', in S Bhattacharya (ed.), Imperialism, medicine and South Asia: a socio-political perspective, 1800-1950, Delhi, Orient Longman (forthcoming). 104 See the \"circular advertisement\" from Guntur, dated 27 Nov. 1800.
