Valmet's Financial Statements Review 2020 | 2Dividend proposal The Board of Directors proposes for the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 0.90 per share be paid. The proposed dividend equals to 58 percent of the net result. Guidance for 2021 Valmet estimates that net sales in 2021 will remain at the previous year's level in comparison with 2020 (EUR 3,740 million) and Comparable EBITA in 2021 will remain at the previous year's level in comparison with 2020 (EUR 365 million). Short-term market outlook Valmet estimates that the short-term market outlook in automation has improved to good (previously good/satisfactory), the short-term market outlook in tissue has improved to good (previously satisfactory), and the short-term market outlook in energy has decreased to weak (previously satisfactory). Valmet reiterates the good short-term market outlook for pulp, and board and paper, and the satisfactory/weak short-term market outlook for services. President and CEO Pasi Laine: Comparable EBITA increased for the seventh consecutive year \"Valmet's orders received amounted to EUR 3.65 billion in 2020. Orders received remained at the previous year's level of over EUR 1 billion in Paper, and decreased in the Pulp and Energy and Services business lines. Automation orders received, including package sales to capital projects, remained at the previous year's level. While the COVID-19 related travel restrictions and lower capacity utilization in graphical paper mills had a negative impact on Services order intake, the pandemic did not cause major impacts on Valmet's capital business. In 2020, the market activity was especially strong in China, where 2020 was a record year for Valmet. Our net sales amounted to EUR 3.74 billion in 2020. Net sales increased in the capital business and remained at previous year's level in the stable business. Comparable EBITA increased 16 percent to EUR 365 million. This represents 9.8 percent of net sales, close to our new target range of 10-12 percent. Our whole organization performed well during this exceptional year and found new ways to operate. Many new digital tools and solutions to do business and serve our customers were introduced, and they can be utilized to improve Valmet's and customers' processes also after the pandemic. In recent years, Valmet has followed its acquisition strategy of making well-considered acquisitions with a clear industrial logic. In 2020, Valmet strengthened its board and tissue technology offering by acquiring PMP Group in Poland. The former PMP's offering of s mall and medium-sized tissue machines and board and paper machine rebuilds complements Valmet's offering for wide and fast machines and rebuilds. In June 2020, Valmet acquired a 14.9 percent ownership in Neles and gradually increased its ownership to 29.5 percent of the company. The potential merger of Valmet and Neles would create a Nordic-based global leader with a unique offering for global process industries and with excellent potential for long-term shareholder value creation. Valmet's business is supported by favorable megatrends, we have a solid order backlog and have been able to improve our profitability every year since the demerger at the end of 2013 . Valmet is starting the year 2021 from a good position.\" Valmet's Financial Statements Review 2020 | 3Key figures1 EUR million Q4/2020 Q4/2019 Change 2020 2019 Change Orders received 940 1,009 % 3,653 3,986 1,167 1,103 6 % 3,740 3,547 5 % Comparable earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (Comparable EBITA) 146 118 24 % 365 316 16 % % of net sales 12.5 % 10.7 % 9.8 % 8.9 % Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) 147 119 23 % 355 315 13 % % of net sales 12.6 % 10.8 % 9.5 % 8.9 % Operating profit (EBIT) 135 110 23 % 319 281 13 % % of net sales 11.6 % 9.9% 8.5 % 7.9 % Profit before taxes 133 105 26 % 307 269 14 % Profit for the period 100 81 24 % 231 202 15 % Earnings per share, EUR 0.67 0.54 24 % 1.54 1.35 15 % Earnings per share, diluted, EUR 0.67 0.54 24 % 1.54 1.35 15 % Equity per share, EUR2 7.60 6.95 9 % 7.60 6.95 9 % Cash flow provided by operating activities 114 182 -37 % 532 295 81 % Cash flow after investments 40 161 -75 % -60 58 Return on equity (ROE) (annualized) 21 % 20 % Return on capital employed (ROCE) before taxes (annualized) 22 % 23 % Equity to assets ratio2 39 % 41 % Gearing2 13 % -9 % 1The calculation of key figures is presented on page 49. 2At end of period.

When the COVID-19 pandemic started, Valmet established a global framework with an incident management team structure and common guidelines, and ensured the implementation of precautionary measures and best practices to protect all as the situation evolved.

The stock exchange release and meeting materials can be viewed on Valmet's website at www.valmet.com/agm . Valmet's Financial Statements Review 2020| 25In compliance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting, on June 25, 2020, Valmet paid out dividends of EUR 0.80 per share. Annual General Meeting 2020 was cancelled and postponed to June 16, 2020 On March 17,2020, following the development of the coronavirus situation and the announcement by the Finnish Government on March 16, 2020, the Board of Directors of Valmet decided to cancel the Annual General Meeting from March 19, 2020. On April 23, 2020, Valmet published a notice convening the Annual General Meeting, which took place on June 16, 2020. The resolutions of the meeting are presented above. Risks and business uncertainties Valmet's operations are affected by various strategic, financial, operational and hazard risks. Valmet takes measures to exploit emerging opportunities and to limit the adverse effects of potential threats. The assessment of risks related to sustainable development holds an important role in risk management. If such threats materialized, they could have material adverse effects on Valmet's business, financial situation and operating result, or on the value of shares and other securities. The objective of Valmet's risk management is to ensure the implementation of an effective and successful strategy for achieving both long- and short-term goals. The task of Valmet's management is to regulate risk appetite. In assessing risks, Valmet takes into consideration the probability of the risks and their estimated impact on net sales and financial results. Valmet's management estimates that the Company's overall risk level is currently manageable in proportion to the scope of its operations and the practical measures available for managing these risks. Financial uncertainty in the global economy, coupled with fluctuations in exchange rates and tightening financial market regulations, may have an adverse effect on the availability of financing from banks and capital markets and could reduce the investment appetite of Valmet's customers. Valmet estimates that the high proportion of business derived from stable business (Services and Automation) and the geographical diversification will reduce the possible negative effects that market uncertainties may have. If global economic growth weakens, it might have adverse effects on new projects under negotiation or on projects in the order backlog. Some projects may be postponed, suspended, or canceled. In the case of long-term delivery projects, initial customer advance payments are typically 10-30 percent of the value of the project, and customers make progress payments as the project is implemented. This significantly decreases the risks and financing requirements related to Valmet's projects. Valmet continually assesses its customers' creditworthiness and their ability to meet their obligations. As a rule, Valmet does not finance customer projects. If economic growth slows down significantly, the markets for Valmet's products may shrink, which may lead to, for example, tougher price competition. Changes and uncertainty in future regulation and legislation can also have critical effects, especially on the energy business. Large fluctuations in energy prices can affect the global economy. These fluctuations can also affect Valmet and its customers, especially in the energy business. Changes in labor costs and the prices of raw materials and components can affect Valmet's profitability. Wage inflation is continuing, but Valmet's goal is to offset this at least partly through increased productivity and strict price discipline. It is possible, however, that tough competition in some product Valmet's Financial Statements Review 2020| 26categories will make it difficult to pass on cost increases to product prices. On the other hand, some of Valmet's customers are raw material producers and their ability to operate and invest may be enhanced by strengthening commodity prices and hampered by declining commodity prices. To ensure a high level of quality in both production and services, it is important to sustain a high level of competence and talent availability. This includes, for example, maintaining efficient recruitment programs, utilization of existing talent and sharing knowledge globally. Through acquisitions, Valmet may become exposed to risks associated with new markets and business environments. The actual acquisition process also includes risks. Other risks associated with acquisitions include, but are not limited to, integration of the acquired business, increased financial risk exposure, retention of key personnel and achieving the targets set for the acquired business. Management of project business risks important An important part of Valmet's business consists of project business. Pulp business projects in particular can be large, thus project-specific risk management is crucial. Key risks related to projects are project cost estimation, scheduling, project risk management, quality and performance risks, and materials management risks. Risk analysis shall, as a minimum, take place for all significant project quotations. The work concerning threat and opportunity assessment continues during the execution phase of the project. Risk management is based on careful planning and continuous, systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project risks are managed by improving and continuously developing project management processes and the related systems. There may be changes in the competitive situation of Valmet's individual businesses, such as the emergence of new, cost-effective competition in the markets. Valmet can safeguard its market position by developing its products and services, and through good customer service and local presence. Availability of financing crucial Securing the continuity of Valmet's operations requires sufficient available funding under all circumstances. Valmet estimates that its liquid cash assets and committed credit limits are sufficient to secure its immediate liquidity and to ensure the flexibility of financing. The average maturity of Valmet's non-current debt, excluding lease liabilities, is 2.3 years. Loan facilities include customary covenants, and Valmet is in clear compliance with the covenants at the balance sheet date. Net working capital and capital expenditure levels have a key impact on the adequacy of Valmet's financing. Setting aside investments into the renewal of the ERP system, Valmet does not expect any significant increase in annual capital expenditure and estimates that it is well-positioned to keep capital expenditure at the level of total depreciation. Of the financial risks that affect Valmet's profit, currency exchange rate risks are among the most substantial. Exchange rate changes can affect Valmet's business, although the wide geographical scope of the Company's operations reduces the impact of any individual currency. Economic insecurity typically increases exchange rate fluctuations. Valmet hedges its currency exposures linked to firm delivery and purchase agreements. Changes in legislation and the way authorities interpret regulation, for example regarding taxation, can also have an impact on Valmet's financials. As at December 31, 2020 , Valmet had EUR 711 million (EUR 687 million ) of goodwill on its statement of financial position. Valmet assesses the carrying value of its goodwill for impairment annually, or more Valmet's Financial Statements Review 2020| 27frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable. Valmet has not identified any indications of impairment during the reporting period. The principles used for impairment testing are presented in the Financial Statements. The COVID-19 pandemic Depending on the success in suppressing the COVID-19 pandemic and in case the outbreak will be further prolonged, there could be further adverse impact on Valmet's operations, customer investment activity, project deliveries, supply chain and availability of financing for both Valmet and its customers. Valmet currently has a solid order backlog, strong balance sheet and liquidity coupled with a flexible organization, and a structured way to operate in changing circumstances. This will aid Valmet in mitigating the global challenges caused by COVID-19. Events after the reporting period There have been no subsequent events after the review period that required recognition or disclosure. Guidance for 2021 Valmet estimates that net sales in 2021 will remain at the previous year's level in comparison with 2020 (EUR 3,740 million) and Comparable EBITA in 2021 will remain at the previous year's level in comparison with 2020 (EUR 365 million). Short-term outlook General economic outlook according to IMF Although recent vaccine approvals have raised hopes of a turnaround in the pandemic later this year, renewed waves and new variants of the virus pose concerns for the outlook. Amid exceptional uncertainty, the global economy is projected to grow 5.5 percent in 2021 and 4.2 percent in 2022. The 2021 forecast is revised up 0.3 percentage point relative to the previous forecast, reflecting expectations of a vaccine- powered strengthening of activity later in the year and additional policy support in a few large economies. The strength of the recovery is projected to vary significantly across countries, depending on access to medical interventions, effectiveness of policy support, exposure to cross-country spillovers, and structural characteristics entering the crisis. (International Monetary Fund, January 26, 2021) Short-term market outlook Valmet estimates that the short-term market outlook in automation has improved to good (previously good/satisfactory), the short-term market outlook in tissue has improved to good (previously satisfactory), and the short-term market outlook in energy has decreased to weak (previously satisfactory). Valmet reiterates the good short-term market outlook for pulp, and board and paper, and the satisfactory/weak short-term market outlook for services. Board of Director's proposal for the distribution of profit Valmet Oyj's distributable funds on December 31, 2020 totaled EUR 1,225,703,224.57 of which the net profit for 2020 was EUR 186,455,188.79 (according to Finnish Generally Accepted Accounting Standards) .

Control of the acquiree was obtained through the purchase of 100 percent equity interest in PMP Group companies. The enterprise value of the acquisition was approximately EUR 64 million on a cash and debt free basis, and preliminary consideration transferred after ordinary post-closing adjustments was EUR 70 million. The acquisition also includes a conditional and capped earn-out component, with an estimated fair value of EUR 4 million as at acquisition date. PMP Group supplies process technologies and services for tissue, board and paper machines globally, focusing on small and medium sized tissue machines and board and paper machine rebuilds. PMP's technology and services portfolio will be a very good complement to Valmet's current paper technology and services for wide and fast machines and rebuilds. Net sales of PMP Group were approximately EUR 70 million in the fiscal year 2019. The company employs about 650 people, the majority of whom are located in Poland and the rest in China, the USA and Italy. Fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill recognized at the date of acquisition, together with net cash flow impact is summarized in the following tables. The net assets acquired are denominated in Polish zoty. Goodwill arising from the business combination is attributable to the assembled workforce and synergies expected to be derived from the combined businesses. Majority of the goodwill arising from the acquisition is not expected to be tax-deductible. The acquired business has been consolidated into the Group financials from the acquisition date onwards. The assumed accounting for the acquisition of PMP Group, including estimated purchase consideration, is based on provisional amounts and the associated purchase accounting is not final. From the date of acquisition, the acquired business has contributed EUR 27 million of revenue and EUR 1 million of profit to the Group, including EUR 1 million amortization of intangibles and inventory fair-value step-up recognized at acquisition. If the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020, management estimates that the combined statement of income would show net sales of EUR 3,802 million and profit for the period amounting to EUR 229 million. These pro forma amounts include income tax expenses as well as the fair value adjustments, determined as at December 31, 2020, for the January-September period for the acquiree. Acquisition related costs of EUR 1 million have been charged to Selling, general and administrative expenses and Other operating income and expenses in the Consolidated statement of income in January- December 2020.Unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's Financial Statements Review 2020| 37Fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and goodwill at the date of acquisition: EUR millionAs at October 1, 20201 Non-current assets Goodwill 35 Other intangible assets 27 Property, plant and equipment 8 Leased assets 2 Deferred tax asset 1 Total non-current assets 73 Current assets Inventories 30 Trade receivables 20 Other current assets 6 Cash and cash equivalents 22 Total current assets 78 Non-current liabilities Non-current lease liabilities 2 Other non-current liabilities 3 Deferred tax liabilities 6 Total non-current liabilities 11 Current liabilities Current debt 12 Trade payables 11 Amounts due to customers under revenue contracts 39 Other current liabilities 5 Total current liabilities 67 Net assets acquired 74 1EUR values have been translated using foreign exchange rates prevailing at the date of the acquisition.

Valmet's four business lines are highly integrated through complementing product and service offerings and joint customer projects. Thus, the operations and profitability of Valmet is reported as a single reportable segment with the key operative decisions being made by the CODM at the Valmet Group level. The performance of the Group is reviewed by the CODM. One key indicator of performance reviewed is Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA). Performance is also assessed through Comparable EBITA, i.e. with EBITA excluding certain items of income and expense that reduce the comparability of the Group's performance from one period to another. The alternative performance measures of EBITA and Comparable EBITA are published by Valmet as part of regulated financial information to enable users of the financial information to prepare more meaningful analysis on Valmet's performance.

Paper, and Pulp and Energy business lines' revenue is derived from large long-term capital projects, for which revenue is mostly recognized over time based on the cost-to-cost method. Service business line's revenue arises from large volume of short-term contracts with relatively low individual value, for which revenue is mainly recognized at a point in time. Automation business line's revenue consists of long-term contracts and short-term service contracts. The nature of long-term contracts, and therefore also the revenue recognition method, is similar to capital projects although with average contract values being lower. Revenue for short-term service contracts is recognized at a point in time. Nature of revenue in each area in any given reporting period is driven by volume and size of ongoing capital projects.

During the reporting period Valmet had not entered into any material contracts where the period between when Valmet transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or more. Neither were there any ongoing projects from previous reporting periods for which the former would apply. The creditworthiness of a customer is verified before entering into a contract. However, if a risk of non- payment arises after contract inception, the probability of collection of consideration is re-evaluated and if assessed improbable, recognition of revenue is discontinued. An allowance for non-collectability of open receivables and contract assets is established as concluded appropriate. Valmet receives payments from customers based on invoicing schedules as set out in the customer contracts. Changes in contract assets and liabilities are due to Valmet's performance under the contracts. Amounts due from customers under revenue contracts primarily relate to Valmet's right to consideration for work completed but not yet invoiced at the reporting date. These assets are transferred to trade receivables when right to consideration becomes unconditional, which is typically at the time when Valmet has contractual right to issue an invoice. Significant part of amounts due to customers relate to advance consideration received from customers in long-term capital contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. These amounts are recognized as revenue as (or when) Valmet performs under the contracts. Following tables provide specification of movements in amounts due from customers under revenue contracts and amounts due to customers under revenue contracts over the reporting period. Revenue recognized in the period also includes revenue recognized related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods, the amount of which however is insignificant.

Unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's Financial Statements Review 2020| 45Investments in associated companies Valmet acquired a minority share in Neles Corporation during July-September 2020. As at December 31, 2020, Valmet held 29.5 percent of Neles' shares and voting rights. Valmet's and Neles' financial statements are coterminous, but as Neles publishes its financial statements at or near the same time as Valmet , Valmet's share of Neles' results are accounted for with a lag of one quarter. Consequently, Valmet's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, include Valmet's share of Neles' third-quarter result. Valmet's investment in Neles did not have a material impact on Valmet's 2020 financial result.
