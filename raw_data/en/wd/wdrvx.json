The purpose of this study was to explore parental perceptions of the impact their child's behavior had on their family between the time risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) was identified and before formal medical diagnosis, and then compare family impact among those whose child met diagnostic criteria for ASD and those who did not. The study found that the parents of children who received a non-ASD diagnosis reported a higher baseline level of family impact. Perception of difficult child behavior was a stronger predictor of family impact than later diagnostic group, and child functioning did not predict family impact. The researchers concluded that in this specific population, perceived difficult child behavior is a stronger predictor of family impact than later diagnostic category. AHRQ-funded; HS022242.

The purpose of this study was to compare different methods of recruiting parents of autistic children to participate in an online survey. To establish a baseline, the researchers simultaneously sent an initial mailed letter and email to a sample of 1,624 parents of autistic children spectrum disorder (autism) from an integrated health system in Southern California. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three follow-up recruitment groups: text message, email, or phone. The study found that all three of the follow-up methods were equally effective for eliciting a survey response, and that the parents of girls were less likely to respond than the parents of boys. The study concluded that text messages, email messages and phone calls are effective in recruiting parents for surveys.

J Pediatr Health Care Author: Mistry KB \"I don't do much without researching things myself\": a mixed methods study exploring the role of parent health literacy in autism services use for young children. This mixed-methods study examined how parent health literacy contributes to health-related outcomes for children with autism. This study included 82 US parents of a child with autism 2-5 years old and sought to describe (1) health literacy dimensions, (2) how health literacy influences services use, and (3) health literacy improvement strategies. The authors found that: autism information was accessed from multiple sources; understanding autism information involved \"doing your own research\"; autism information empowered decision-making; health literacy facilitated behavioral services use; health literacy influenced medication use; family and system characteristics also affected services use; autism education remains needed; services information is needed across the diagnostic odyssey; and greater scientific information accessibility would increase uptake.

J Autism Dev Disord 2022 AM, Stotts NM Caregiver strain among North American parents of children from the Autism Treatment Network Registry Call-Back Study. This study showed on average caregiver strain did not significantly change in North American parents of children with autism during a 2-year period. Improved caregiver strain was found to be linked to improved child functioning and behavior. Recommendations included routine assessment of caregiver strain, and referral to evidence-based programming and supports in order to help alleviate some of the burden that families of children with autism commonly experience.

Autism Concordance between patient-centered and adaptive behavior outcome measures after applied behavior analysis for autism. In clinical trials, applied behavioral analysis (ABA) is an evidence-based approach to autism spectrum disorder that has been shown to improve child functional status. Setting and tracking individualized, patient-centered goals is a focus in ABA, yet there is little research on measuring progress on such goals. The purpose of this study was to observe and evaluate a clinical sample of children 3 to 16 years of age (N=154) receiving 24 months of ABA for autism spectrum disorder, and assess the concordance between patient-centered and standard outcome measures of treatment progress. The study found that there was limited concordance among measures at 12 and 24 months of ABA. The study also found that between 12 and 24 months of ABA, the percentage of children who achieved clinically meaningful gain on patient-centered goal measures increased, while the percentage of children who achieved clinically meaningful gains in adaptive behavior decreased. The study concluded that providers should have continuous dialogue with patients and caregivers to ensure that ASD programs and interventions progress toward meaningful goals and outcomes for patients and their caregivers.

BMC Pediatr 2022 May JH, Kofner A Brief report: Medicaid expansion and growth in the workforce for autism spectrum disorder. This study examined the role that state Medicaid expansion has played in utilization of child psychiatrists, board-certified behavioral analysts (BCBAs) and pediatricians for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Health workforce data from HRSA was used to examine workforce growth from 2008-2017. State Medicaid expansion was associated with a 9% increase in BCBAs per 100,000 children one year after enactment, and a 5% increase in child psychiatrists, but no association with growth in pediatrician utilization.

This study's purpose was to investigate associations between parent vaccine confidence and intentions to have their child with autism vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine. A cross-sectional, web-based survey of 332 parents of children with autism spectrum disorder who were members of an integrated healthcare system in Southern California was conducted from May to July 2021. Approximately 35% of parents were going to vaccinate their child against COVID-19. Positive vaccine beliefs, healthcare provider trust, or parent vaccination status were associated with intention to vaccinate. AHRQ-funded; HS026407. Citation: Choi K, Becerra-Culqui T, Bhakta B .

The purpose of this study was to examine patterns of service receipt and patient outcomes for children receiving applied behavior analysis (ABA) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in an integrated health care system in which commercially insured children were covered by a state autism mandate. Findings showed that, in a health system implementation of ABA for children with ASD, there were high rates of ABA discontinuation and low ABA dosing. These challenges may diminish the potential benefits of ABA, even with mandated commercial insurance coverage. AHRQ-funded; HS026407. Citation: Choi KR, Bhakta B, Knight EA .

J Dev Behav Pediatr 2022 Research, Evidence-Based Practice Kuhn J, Levinson Udhnani, MD What happens after a positive primary care autism screen among historically underserved families? Predictors of evaluation and autism diagnosis. This study examined predictors of receiving a recommended diagnostic evaluation after a recommended primary care-administered autism screen, and of those who screen positive, who is most likely to be diagnosed with autism. Participants were 309 predominantly low-income, racial/ethnic minority parents and their child aged 15-27 months who screened positive with the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F). Significant predictors of diagnostic evaluation included older parental age, being non-Hispanic and the child having private insurance, lower child communication functioning, or receiving Early Intervention services. Significant predictors of an autism diagnosis included being male, having lower child communication functioning, screening directly in the parent's preferred language, White/non-Hispanic parent, and no parent history of mood disorder.

This study examined trajectories of parenting stress, coping, and perceived family impact over time throughout the autism diagnostic process among Hispanic and non-Hispanic families. Findings showed that Hispanic families reported lower levels of parenting stress, coping, and negative family impact across time. Further, there were differences in the change in use of coping and the amount of negative family impact reported between Hispanic and non-Hispanic parents over time. AHRQ-funded; HS022242.

This study looked at impacts of a modification to a pilot program called Family Navigation to help low-income, minority children needing autism-related diagnostic services receive those services. An advisory group recommended modifications to recruitment criteria and study conditions. 40 parent-child dyad participants were randomized between the two pilots to receive usual care (UC) or modified FN. Participant enrollment, satisfaction with clinical care, and timely completion of the diagnostic assessment were compared. Recruitment improved significantly with the modified protocol (4.8% vs. 19.5%) and no participants were excluded from study enrollment compared to the first pilot (43.6%). Families in the second pilot were more likely to complete diagnostic assessment and report greater satisfaction with clinical care.

This study looked at spending trends on young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in employer-sponsored plans from 2011 to 2017. This cross-section analysis examined claims data from large-employer-sponsored health plans and assessed changes in annual expenditures by service type for children ages 3-5 enrolled for 1 year or more, and with two or more claims with ASD billing codes within a calendar year and compared it to all children. Mean spending per children with ASD increased by 51% in 2017 US dollars in 2017, while for all children the increase was 8%. ASD spending accounted for 41% of spending growth for children ages 3-7 during 2011-2017. Outpatient behavioral intervention-related spending increased by 376% during the time period, while spending on all other services increased by 2%. AHRQ-authored. Citation: Grosse SD, Ji X, Zuvekas .

This study examined outcomes for implementation of a decision support system called CHICA (Child Health Improvement Through Computer Automation) to improve screening rates for autism in children aged 18 to 24 months. A random sample of 274 children in four urban clinics was used. Two clinics participated in the intervention, and two served as controls. Because participating clinics requested intervention be discontinued for children aged 18 months, only results for those aged 24 months was analyzed. Of the 263 children with reviewed results, 92% were enrolled in Medicaid, 52.5% were African American, and 36.5% were Hispanic. Screening rates increased from 0% at baseline to 100% in 24 months during the study period of November 2010 to November 2012. Screening results were positive for 265 of 980 children screened by CHICA in the time period, with 2 children from the intervention group positively diagnosed in the time frame of the study.

This study's goal was to examine healthcare access and service use among US children with autism spectrum disorder. Data was analyzed from the 2011-2014 National Health Interview Survey data on 651 children with autism spectrum disorder aged 2-17 years. Three measures of healthcare access problems were used: delays accessing healthcare, difficulty affording healthcare, and trouble finding a healthcare provider. Five service measures were used: 4 office visits, 1 well-child visit, flu vaccine, prescription medication, and 1 emergency department visit. Twenty-nine percent of children were found to have had 1 healthcare access problem. This healthcare access problem was associated with lower adjusted odds of 1 well-child visit or prescription medications but higher adjusted odds for 1 emergency department visit or 4 office visits. The association between healthcare access problems and emergency department use were higher for those with higher economic status and White, non-Hispanic subgroups. AHRQ-funded; HS000063.

Automating the extraction of behavioral criteria indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in electronic health records (EHRs) can contribute significantly to the effort to monitor the condition. Word embedding algorithms such as Word2Vec can encode semantic meanings of words in vectors and assist in automated vocabulary discovery from EHRs. However, text available for training word embeddings for ASD is miniscule compared to the billions of tokens typically used. In this study, the investigators evaluated the importance of corpus specificity versus size and hypothesized that for specific domains small corpora can generate excellent word embeddings.
