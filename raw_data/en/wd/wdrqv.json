Reader Reviews: Being a retired boxer/kickboxer and now in my 40's, I was looking for ways of keeping fit internally and seeking relief from the numerous aches and pains aquired while participating in extreame [sports](https://www.naturalnews.com/sports.html) for so many years. This book not only provides many [remedies](https://www.naturalnews.com/remedies.html) for sports injuries, but for ailments of all kinds. I especially like the way he translates the chinese [herbs](https://www.naturalnews.com/herbs.html) into botanical language as many of the herbs can be found in our own [health](https://www.naturalnews.com/health.html) food stores. The only slight complaint is that he doesn't say much about our own american ginseng as it is highly valued by the chinese. Otherwise I find it to be highly informative for both the novice and advanced student of the ways of [herbal](https://www.naturalnews.com/herbal.html) healing. Deep bow.this was a really good book. It gave herbal remedies for illnesses, and also gave the [symptoms](https://www.naturalnews.com/symptoms.html) for those illnesses. This book acted as two books; it gave info on illnesses, AND the herbal formulas to correct those illnesses. my only problem with this book is that in the index, it gives an [illness](https://www.naturalnews.com/illness.html), and then says: see so and so. This is good, but then it gives you a page number. You turn to that page, and there is no info on the illness there, except a little thing saying, illness-see another illness. while this is a little annoying, you have to put up with it, because this book is worth it. Great job!Hey! This was a great book. Not only because it gives lots of chinese herbal cures to the ilnesses talked about in it, but because it gives symptoms for all those diseases. This book was a relly good guide to staying aware of health. I had never even considered [Chinese herbs](https://www.naturalnews.com/Chinese_herbs.html) as effective medicine before i red this book, but now i know better. good job Richard. this book is great and should be read by all who want an alternative to Western Medicine!
