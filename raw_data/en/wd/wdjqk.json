The Institute of Noetic Sciences, or [IONS](https://noetic.org/), has been studying the nature of reality through rigorous scientific exploration for nearly 50 years. In their latest study, IONS scientists set out to validate both the practice of reiki and the phenomenon of clairvoyance or \"extended seeing.\" Dr. Helan\u00e8 Wahbeh is the [head of research](https://noetic.org/profile/helane-wahbeh/) at IONS, and has been studying energy medicine for decades. \"People who are energy medicine practitioners might call energy this system that runs throughout the body that they experience as energetic, magnetic, tingling, etc. around the body,\" Wahbeh said. \"One type of energy medicine that is commonly used around the world is called Reiki, and Reiki is a technique that originated in Japan. It's based on the principle that the therapist can actually channel energy into the patient and activate their natural healing process \u2014 their innate ability to heal themselves, often releasing obstacles and allowing an optimal flow throughout the body.\" Reiki is one of the best-studied [energy medicine modalities](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28874060/), having been shown in clinical studies to be effective in conditions including pain, anxiety, depression, cancer, and others. In this IONS experiment, researchers wanted to study the effect of Reiki on people with a variety of physical and mental health conditions to test the principle that the modality uses a universal life force energy and can therefore be applied to anyone for any condition. \"We had six Reiki masters with extensive experience give 30-minute sessions to 40 participants. The participant would come in, they would lay down in this reclining chair, and the Reiki practitioner would say that they were going to start their session, they would place their hands on different parts of their body and direct the Reiki energy for 30 minutes,\" Wahbeh said. The results were profound. \"We saw that, yes, well-being \u2014 which is our primary clinical outcome \u2014 significantly improved from the session immediately after, and also one week later, and that negative affect also improved,\" Wahbeh said. \"Participants had multiple, different types of health conditions; memory impairment, depression, anxiety, and acute injury. So these are four very different types of health issues, and yet across all of the participants we saw an improvement in well-being, and this supports the notion that Reiki practitioners suggest, which is that Reiki is universal; it's a [universal life-force energy](/topic/energy-healing) and can help anybody.\" While these results were significant in and of themselves, researchers incorporated another fascinating component into the experiment. While the reiki sessions were being conducted, six experienced clairvoyant seers observed the sessions. Various forms of data were then collected to determine whether the information the clairvoyants were receiving through their extended perception was accurate. Researchers then analyzed the data to answer several important questions. \"Do the different perceivers perceive in the same way? What is the corroboration in what they receive during the session? Did the Reiki masters' answers match up with the perceivers? Did it match up with the participant?\" Wahbeh asked. What researchers found was groundbreaking.

Allopathic medicine and science have traveled a narrow path built on chemical substances and sharp instruments rather than energy. But the ancients recognized sound, vibration, and frequency as powerful forces that influence life all the way down to the cellular level. The gifted Greek philosopher Pythagoras prescribed [music](https://www.gaia.com/video/power-sound-jill-purce) as medicine, asserting that the musical intervals he discovered are clear expressions of [sacred geometry](https://www.gaia.com/video/sound-sacred-geometry-eric-rankin). He stated that music is the phenomena of numbers in time, reflecting the structures of nature, and has the power to restore balance in an organism. Sound Healing Research According to a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15813154) published by the National Institute of Health, \"Music effectively reduces anxiety for medical and surgical patients and often reduces surgical and chronic pain. [Also,] Providing music to caregivers may be a strategy to improve empathy, compassion, and care.\" In other words, music is not only good for patients; it's good for those who care for them. A 2010 Finnish study observed that stroke patients who were given access to music as cognitive therapy had improved recovery. Other research has shown that patients suffering from the loss of speech due to brain injury or stroke regain it more quickly by learning to sing before trying to speak. The phenomenon of music facilitating healing in the brain after a stroke is called the \" [Kenny Rogers Effect](https://www.wired.com/2009/03/musicheals).\" For those struggling with addiction and substance dependencies, learning to play an instrument may play an important role in recovery. A [study](https://people.uwec.edu/rasarla/research/Addictions/index.htm) at the University of Wisconsin showed that exposure to the right music, tones, and frequencies produces dopamine, which is in short supply for the nervous system during the withdrawal process. \"If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration.\" \u2014Nikola Tesla Singing bowl bathing is gaining popularity as a method to reduce stress and anxiety and to promote well-being. Laying down with eyes closed, participants listen while different bowls are struck and toned by a practitioner. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27694559) show that this practice, called \"sound bathing,\" directly reduces anxiety and depression; both are related to increases in disease. According to one study, \"Sixty-two women and men with an average age of 50 reported significantly less tension, anger, fatigue, and depressed mood after sound sessions. Tibetan singing bowl meditation may be a feasible low-cost low technology intervention for reducing feelings of tension, anxiety, and depression, and increasing spiritual well-being.\" A [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264954368_Music_as_Therapy) published in the Southern Medical Journal (2005) demonstrated the beneficial effects of music in hospital settings. Researchers reported that \"For children and adults, music effectively reduces anxiety and improves mood for medical and surgical patients, and for patients in intensive care units.\" Researchers also noted that ambient music increased empathy in caregivers without interfering with the technical aspects of treatment. Can Sound Fight Cancer? In 1981, biologist Helene Grimal partnered with composer Fabien Maman to [study](http://www.worldcat.org/title/role-of-music-in-the-twenty-first-century/oclc/751256164) the relationship of sound waves to living cells. Maman was also an acupuncturist and had previously [discovered](https://tama-do.com/roothtmls/acupuncture.html) that by using tuning forks and colored light on acupuncture points he could achieve equal and even greater results than he could with needles. For 18 months, Grimal and Maman worked with the effects of 30-40 decibel sounds on human cells. With a camera mounted on a microscope, the researchers observed uterine cancer cells exposed to different acoustic instruments (guitar, gong, xylophone) as well as the human voice for 20-minute sessions. Using the nine-note Ionian Scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D), Grimal and Maman observed that when [exposed to sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w0_kazbb_U), cancer cells lost structural integrity until they exploded at the 14-minute mark. Far more dramatic was the sound of a human voice \u2014 the cells were destroyed at the nine-minute mark. Next, Maman and Grimal worked with two women with breast cancer. For one month, the women devoted three-and-a-half hours a day to \"toning,\" or singing the scale. One woman's tumor became undetectable, meaning it simply disappeared. The other woman underwent surgery. Her surgeon reported that her tumor had shrunk dramatically and \"dried up.\" It was removed and the woman had a complete recovery and remission. Maman said, \"Cancer cells cannot maintain their structure when specific sound wave frequencies attack the cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes. When the vibratory rate increases, the cells cannot adapt or stabilize themselves and die by disintegrating "}
