You have to take my leg off?\" he asked, somewhat surprised. \"No, Mr Smith, you have pneu- monia, and we are going to make you better,\" I restated in a louder voice. \"Well, you gotta do what you got- ta do,\" he said somewhat resigned to his fate. Fortunately, Mr Smith improved with IV antibiotics and was dis-charged with both legs intact, much to his relief. My point is that good communication is a big part of being an effective physician. Not only are informed patients more accepting of necessary treatments, but I would ar - gue that their clinical outcomes also improve.* Good communication takes time, and before granting my halo please realize I often fail miser - ably in this department. My aging mother has spent most of the last few months accessing and consuming the health care dollars she contributed through her lifetime of MSP premiums. She is currently in the midst of her third protracted hos-pital stay involving numerous tests and procedures. This has highlighted another area of communication for me\u2014the often forgotten job of keep- ing families informed. My mother doesn't have any cognitive issues so her care team is able to communicate with her directly. However, when I ask about her treatment plan she often shrugs her arthritic shoulders claim-ing it isn't clear to her. The cleaning staff who are in the area, while very good at their job, fall a little short when asked about the next step in treating heart failure. In addition, at-tempting to get further information from the various nurses who come on and off shift is very difficult. I so ap- preciate when one of her physicians takes a moment to call me and update me on her condition and next steps. Sadly, telephone contact like this is quite rare. My recent experience has encouraged me to keep the families of my patients, particularly those in hos-pital, more informed. I have always found family members incredibly thankful for a brief update about fur - ther investigations, treatment plans, and potential length of stay. This in-formation prepares them for the worst or allows them to make plans for po-tential discharge or a change in level of care. I find these phone calls take only a few minutes, but they are ap-preciated by all and well worth the effort. So, one of my resolutions for 2019 is to call relatives less sporadically and more regularly. I encourage you to do the same. Happy New Year to you all. \u2014DRR *I have no proof of this and I am certainly not going to perform a low-response sur - vey study as evidence (see my September 2018 editorial concerning such studies).editorials \" Good communication is a big part of being an effective physician. info@pollockclinics.com 604-717-6200 www.pollockclinics.com Men's Sexual Health and Wellness Program for your Patients with Erectile Dysfunction Shockwave Therapy Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy Testosterone Replacement Therapy Sex Therapy with a certified and experienced Sex Therapist Patients will undergo a comprehensive initial assessment (MSP covered) with a doctor's referral.7 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.orgeditorials I feel like I am not unusual in some- times planning to just shoot off an important or timely email when I have the required 2 minutes, espe-cially when I know I might forget about it or just not get to it later. Just 2 minutes. Perhaps you've shared this sce- nario: You have written your quick but eloquent missive and are standing up while pressing send on your way to your next consult, when you see that big beige box appear across your screen: \"You have exceeded the stor - age limit for your mailbox. You may not send or receive emails.\" In the privacy of my office, see- ing that message will almost always be accompanied by a loud expletive-laden frustrated groaning blustering, \"AAAARGGGHH, email jail!\" ema - nating from what feels like the depths of my own motherboard. A task that should have taken 2 minutes either has to be aborted or put on hold, or I have to sit down and spend time deleting larger emails, then empty-ing the trash, then finding my draft, and then attempting a resend. If the mailbox cleanup did not suffice, then I have to go back and pick what must be dumped forever. My emails live in an institutional account in an academic practice. I really, truly understand and respect limitations of shared storage space. I was fortunately once granted a glori-ous increase in allowable space, and I delete and archive regularly, although I am suspicious of archiving because I was burned once when all of my archived files disappeared with my trusty old computer (or became in-accessible) when the hardware was being updated. My archived emails had apparently been set up to be saved separately using older software or something-something-acronym-laden-IT-words something. But the cold hard result was that I didn't have them anymore.If I am answering emails on my phone, the notification that alerts me that my emails haven't been sent due to my exceeding my mailbox limit is much less prominent, and the emails may nest in my outbox while I, bliss-fully unaware of their purgatorial fate, wait patiently for answers to emails my recipients haven't received. It is often important to be able to store and search emails. I cannot print and file all of the emails that may be important in the future. In a world where physicians like me work with or within a hospital administra-tive structure for years or generations longer than the administrators on the current letterhead, we may have the most or even only institutional mem-ory. Many of those memories are em-bedded in my email threads, and they will often be the source of informa-tion closest to the truth of decisions, plans, mistakes, and promises made. I also run a practice where photo- graphs are important. Patients living in the far reaches of the province un-derstand the nonconfidential nature of email but consent to sending pictures of wounds and tissue expander prog-ress because, on balance, that is how they can most effectively and safely communicate important questions or concerns. This practice is imperfect and reprimandable, but the proper route, which involves secondary websites and complex workarounds, involves levels of encryption and registration that are, in practice, not achievable by most of my patient families. We don't have a PACS sys-tem in our health region that allows patient photos to be sent, archived, and confidentially accessed like ra - diological images, so when a family sends them to my email, I save them as soon as I can to my individual in-stitutional photo archive behind our firewall or print them for the patient chart, and then, in both cases, imme-diately delete the images from my in-box. This disposition requires me to be at my hospital office desktop. But there are days when I may receive 15 to 20 MB of photos, and I am not able to be at my desk, and I have to choose to delete them, save them to my lap-top, or remain in email jail. Because of the firewall, I can't save them sepa-rately in a fashion that provides suf-ficient confidentiality. I need to find a better way. So, I am now on the reduce-the- size-of-emails bandwagon. There are days when I get over 100 emails. Ev-ery time someone sends an email that is more than 500 KB, that adds to the total. I get notices of rounds, admin-istrative news, and meetings every single day, including on weekends, many in which there are legitimately a few sentences of important informa-tion, but they are delivered via a PDF attachment with decorations, pho-tos, and large announcement fonts that turn it into a 2 MB email. An-nouncements from the Department of Surgery are usually forwarded again at the divisional level, so the dupli-cation doubles the megabytes. I re-cently printed a letter announcing a lovely award nomination that had four lines of content in it, but was a 5 MB attachment. I encourage everyone to start applying the environmental move-ment's \"reduce\" portion of the three Rs to emails. First, do I really need to receive the email in the first place? Large group emails often don't need to come to me the first time, let alone be answered with reply all. And honestly, if you need to really emphasize something within email text, instead of attach-ing a word file, I'm okay if you use a few ALL CAPS; I won't accuse you of yelling. Say what you need to in the body of the email, and make the subject line logically searchable.

However, it can be dif-ficult to balance the desire to provide prompt care with the risks of over-investigation and treatment. Here we present the case of a retired surgeon turned patient that exemplified some of these challenges and provided us with a learning opportunity that we'd like to share with readers. An 81-year-old male surgeon was evaluated for chest pain, pal-pitations, and a troponin elevation. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was promptly diagnosed and stan-dard therapies, including a coronary angiogram, were requested. Subse-quently, laboratory tests revealed an acute kidney injury (serum cre-atine 404 umol/L), supported by the presence of hyperkalemia (K + 5.8 mmol/L). The on-call nephrologist was consulted; the patient's K + was pharmacologically treated, a Foley catheter was placed, a renal ultra-sound was requested, and the angio-gram was canceled. Several hours later, follow-up laboratory investi - gations were entirely normal. It was then determined that the original tests were reported in error, and like-ly no acute kidney injury was ever present. Unfortunately, our patient sustained trauma from the Foley, and the angiogram needed to be delayed owing to bleeding concerns on his ACS medications. Medical errors are not uncom- mon occurrences, 1 and most relate to human factors.2 A variety of deci- sion support systems and quality im-provement protocols exist to reduce mistakes. 3 Errors made by analytical equipment are less common and are on the decline. 4 In this case, the er - ror related here not only resulted in patient harm but also led to needless investigations, prolonged hospitaliza - tion, and specialist referral. (In 2005, the average cost of hospitalization for ACS in Canada was $80 000. 5) Thankfully, our patient recovered quickly and experienced no long-term morbidity. He graciously accepted our apology. As a retired surgeon, he wisely reminded the cardiology trainees to interpret laboratory results in the appropriate clinical context! It was a teachable moment in many respects.

Re: Residential care disparities I recently came across a report while on a public health elective in my fourth year of medical school. Ad-mittedly, I am new to medicine, but I was truly shocked by the data pre-sented by the Office of the Seniors Advocate BC. These provincial data were powerful, concluding, \"if you are a resident living in a licensed care facility operated by a contracted pro- vider versus one operated by a health authority, you are 32% more likely to be sent to the emergency department, 34% more likely to be hospitalized, have a 32% longer length of stay, have a 47% greater likelihood that you will become an 'Alternate Level small, and use them only when nec-essary.

In my short career in medicine to date, I have encountered a number of patients with preventable admis-sions and have seen many negative consequences of the designated ALC label, something I'm sure more ex - perienced physicians could relate to. Preventable transfers from contracted care facilities to hospital not only in-crease the demand on hospital physi-cian and health authority resources ($17 million and over 16 000 beds annually), 1 but also result in poor outcomes for BC's vulnerable se-nior population. Contracted care fa - cilities are not performing at the level of health authority facilities, and the Seniors Advocate report provides an excellent analysis attempting to get to the root cause. This is an important is-sue with hospital costs and congestion increasing. Reducing unnecessary hospitalization for seniors by decreas-ing the disparity between health au-thority and contracted care facilities is a worthy goal both for the taxpayer and for improving the lives of seniors. \u2014Sarah Fraser, BSc KelownaReference 1.

Re: Pseudoscience, anti-science, and woo Dr Cadesky wrote a powerful editor - ial on the importance of stories in pa- tient education [BCMJ 2018;60:343]. While I wholeheartedly agree on the effectiveness of using personal nar - rative to drive social change, I wish to also point out the importance of physicians' language in engaging patients. Dr Cadesky encourages \"[mentioning] our wheelchair-bound patients who have polio to vaccine-hesitant parents.\" As a physiatrist, I regularly work with patients who use wheelchairs. Many will tell you that these devices are not binding, but rather opening. Wheelchairs may help our patients do things many able-bodied individuals take for granted\u2014move about on our sidewalks and in our parks instead of being stuck at home, conserve the en-ergy it takes to walk with a disability so that it can be better spent on time with family, and participate in sports like wheelchair basketball for social and health benefits. The language we as physicians use has a powerful influence on how patients see themselves, how fami-lies see patients, how our colleagues and medical learners see patients, and how patients feel their physicians see them. Thus, language can help em-power our patients, or it can alienate them. I encourage my fellow physi-cians to consider their own uncon-scious biases toward their patients who are differently abled, and to re-flect how this plays out in the words they use in clinical settings. Maybe we need to change the language we use in our stories, too. \u2014Ranita Manocha, MD, FRCPC Calgary, AB Re: Diabetes in BC Dr Ur, in his editorial for the Novem-ber 2018 diabetes theme issue [BCMJ 2018;60:436-438], suggests we are grossly undertreating diabetes in BC, and that British Columbians deserve better.

New food sources Traditionally the fee-for-service sys-tem has been based on swings and roundabouts: straightforward visits balanced by longer, more complex ones. But with competition for low-er complexity services, this survival model no longer holds. Rather than dig in our heels, we should cede this territory and embrace the potential of artificial intelligence, while letting nurse practitioners and physician as-sistants practise to their scope. This, of course, requires a new way of funding doctors to focus on the valuable types of care that only we can provide. Such an ecosystem would be more harmoni-ous and would allow us to make the best use of our skills. It would likely involve team-based care and may not fit nicely in the fee-for-service box, although we should remain agnostic about the particular funding model while work on this continues. Sustainable habitat Doctors have traditionally taken on the burden for a large part of health care infrastructure, paying for work-space, supplies, staffing, insurance, and other costs. As collaborative prac-tices become more prevalent, we need to look at separating the funding for care from the funding for infrastruc-The North Atlantic right whale. The spotted turtle. The com-munity-based doctor. These are all species at risk. The signs are clear: long wait lists; 1 offices that move or close;2 retiring doctors who can't find re-placements 3 and orphan their patients; fewer doctors choosing community-based practice, especially those with longitudinal relationships; burnout, incivility, and suicide. Health care is always dynamic, but it feels like change\u2014and the pres-sures it brings\u2014is accelerating ex-ponentially. The cost of living and doing business in British Columbia is increasing as both personal and com-mercial rents are rising faster than the medical payment schedule. While we advocate for networks that allow im-proved patient access to doctors who know them, relationships are already fragmented by in-person and virtual episodic-care clinics. Executive phys-icals, wellness spas, and alternative providers further stress our system in the cases of inappropriate investiga-tion, diagnosis, and treatment. All of this leads to the cycle of increased de-mands for services and more complex visits for doctors. We have seen new graduates re- ject traditional styles of practice while longing for a system that sup-ports them to practise the high-quality relationship-based care they were trained for and desire. We can hardly blame our colleagues who choose po-sitions with fewer administrative bur - dens\u2014don't we all dream of a future free from interminable forms, faxes, and phones? What we need is a new model that allows doctors, and, for that matter, all health care professionals, to practise to their scope and spend more time with patients. I won't pretend to have An endangered species: How to save ourselves ture. As always, this should be a choice: some doctors with an entrepreneur - ial spirit may want to remain involved in day-to-day operations and enjoy the associated business auton - omy. Others may want to focus on clinical care and perhaps work part-time in multiple settings that provide rewarding and varied opportunities. Again, we should not advocate for a particular option but rather for doc-tors to have the autonomy to decide how they balance clinical and admin-istrative duties. Flock together We have seen elsewhere what hap - pens when the interests of small groups are put above those of the en-tire species. While there may be times when we do not get what we feel we deserve on a particular issue, letting smaller disputes erode our overall relationships with each other weak-ens us as a profession. Our brains are wired to attend to changing stimuli, so we must work hard and not lose sight of the fact that we have much more in common than not. No matter where we practise, what we practise, or our stage of practice, we all work together to care for our patients, our commun-ities, and each other. We are as strong as we are united. Tribalism and identity politics within our profession are the fastest paths to extinction. Rather, let us come to-gether as a mosaic and encourage di-verse thoughts so that we can hear all ideas and respect each other's unique views in the context of a whole pro-fession. We are at a tipping point with What we need is a new model that allows doctors to practise to their scope and spend more time with patients.11 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.orgthe viability of community medi- cine in peril.

Diabetes Canada also confirmed this incidence rate2 and even proposed that by 2020, BC, at 25.4%, will have the second lowest prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes in Canada, after Alberta (23.6%) and will remain below the Canadian average (26%). BC has the lowest rates of obes- ity, the highest rates of physical ac-tivity, and the highest per-capita consumption of fruits and vegetables in Canada. Perhaps we're already doing well compared to other prov-inces? Some might wonder, maybe we are not sufficiently screening for diabetes in BC? Not if what Dia-betes Canada says is reliable, when they report that among all Canadian provinces, BC has the highest rate of screening for diabetes in Canada. 3 Canada has great variability, across provinces, how many diseases im-pact the population. In terms of dia-betes hospital admissions, Quebec and BC have the lowest rates in the country, below the Canadian and OECD averages. 1 Dr Ur's article, \"Challenges to managing type 2 diabetes in British Columbia: Discordant guidelines and limited treatment options\" not surprisingly, is highly critical of the Therapeutics Initiative. Diabetes is a major cause of morbidity in British Columbia, but there are also myriad other health care issues. It is only reasonable that scarce funds are not wasted on very expensive new patented medications when generic ones may suffice. \u2014John Sehmer, MD, MSc Vancouver References 1.

Author replies In his letter, Dr Sehmer disputes our assertions regarding the lim-ited treatment options for diabetes in BC, yet he cites epidemiological data on incidence rates, obesity, and physical activity, none of which are relevant to our argument, and none of which we dispute. British Columbia is indeed for - tunate to have a somewhat lower (though still alarming) incidence of diabetes, and complex social, eco-nomic, and demographic factors are at play here. The problem is what happens to British Columbians af - ter they are diagnosed with diabetes, and it is simply a matter of public record that therapeutic options for diabetes in our province are limit-ed in comparison to the rest of the country. Of course, even in BC, they are not limited for fortunate indi - viduals like government and univer - sity employees who have extended employment insurance benefits that provide them with access to modern evidence-based medications that other provinces offer to their less-wealthy residents. Those who are excluded in BC are the poor and the old, and I do not believe that offering them additional therapeutic options would constitute wasting scarce funds.

Impact of donor origin on survival after orthotopic heart transplantation Heart transplantation is the definitive management for select patients with end-stage heart failure in BC. Due to an ongoing organ donor shortage, or - gans are sometimes allocated from distant locales. These organs may be perceived as less desirable due to donor risk factors and ischemic times. We compared survival after heart trans - plantation in BC between 1 December 1988 and 21 October 2014 stratified by donors originating from BC, other Canadian provinces, and the US.Among 382 patients, 297 (77.7%) recipients and 238 (62.3%) donors were male. The median recipient age was 55 years and the median donor age was 33 years. Median ischemic time was lower in BC donors (168 IQR [107.5, 228.0] min) compared with Canada (243 IQR min) and the US (244 IQR [217.3, 278.8] min) (P < 0.01). Overall 10-year survival 95% CI [56.3, 67.4]. dif- ference in 10-year survival when com-paring donors from BC, Canada, and the US ( Figure ) despite significantly different ischemic times. Multivariate Cox regression analysis found no rela-tionship between origin and mortality after controlling for recipient age, do-nor age, and cold ischemic time. Among patients undergoing or - thotopic heart transplantation in BC, carefully selected distant-donor or - gans result in similar long-term out-comes despite increased ischemic times. Incorporating these findings into organ allocation protocols may extend criteria for donor selection, thereby increasing the donor pool and organ availability. \u2014Omid Kiamanesh, MD of British ColumbiaFigure.

We've heard optimism\u2014and concern. Will MD still be for physicians? Will we still put your interests and needs above everything else? Our unequivocal answer is: Y es. In fact, we've made four specific commitments that you can hold us to: 1) The same objective, expert and physician-centred advice you've always trusted Our Advisors are not required or incentivized to sell any specific investment products\u2014including Scotiabank's\u2014that they don't truly believe are best suited to meet your financial requirements. We'll continue to put your needs first and foremost\u2014always. Our Advisors\u2014the people who know and understand physicians' finances best\u2014remain dedicated to MD, and our staff turnover rate remains far below the industry average.1 Scotiabank is a world-class organization with scale, resources and capital that we didn't have previously. With Scotiabank behind us, we can benefit from their tools, technologies and strategic partnerships to provide a better client experience and make it easier for you to do business with your Advisor. 2) The same fees\u2014or lower\u2014and sound investment management Our fees, which have not changed since the acquisition, are some of the lowest in Canada and continue to be among the most competitive on the market. Our management expense ratios (MERs) are, on average, 29% lower than others in the industry.2 Additionally Scotiabank has committed to keeping our fees the same\u2014or even decreasing them. As the world\u2014and financial services in particular\u2014becomes more complex, businesses like ours are under increasing pressure to keep up. We have always vowed to manage your investments conservatively and to avoid unnecessary risk; Scotiabank will help us continue to meet those obligations as regulatory requirements continue to evolve. 3) The same strong physician voice We fully understand that physicians provide an invaluable perspective that strengthens who we are and what we do. That's why we'll continue to actively seek your input and feedback through multiple channels, including a physician advisory council. 4) Broader and more innovative choices We can now complement our existing products and services with the robust suite of category-leading banking products and services3 delivered by Scotiabank\u2014if and when you need them\u2014including a registered disability savings plan (RDSP); lines of credit with preferred interest rates; medical student and resident lines of credit; Private Banking; credit cards; and special mortgage rates. The job ahead of us is clear: to prove these words with action. Yo u are a part of our DNA. And for as long as we have the honour of serving you, that will never change.

Looking for data that might shed some light on the question, the author undertook a review of recent literature and performed a qualitative structured analysis of narratives from 100 adolescent patients who smoke cannabis daily. A.M. Ocana, MD, CCFP, ABAM On 17 October 2018, Canada joined nine American states and Uruguay by enacting legislation to legalize, regulate, and restrict access to cannabis for non-medical purposes. So far, legalization has had mixed reviews. The good news is that teen use ap- pears to be dropping, now that there are serious penalties for selling to mi-nors. 1 The rate of violent crime has decreased by 10%,2 and tax revenues have increased, giving some states over US$100 million annually to spend on programs for mental health and addiction. 3 The bad news is that there are more accidental overdoses and deaths,4 more cannabis-related convictions for driv-ing under the influence, and more fatal crashes. 5 Furthermore, high taxes on cannabis have left plenty of room for the black market to continue to thrive. 6 The most troubling trend is that overall use is increasing in the US.7 In Colorado, where there are more mari-juana dispensaries than there are Star - bucks and McDonald's combined, legal sales increased by 33% in the last year and by 700% since 2012. 8 This makes the US cannabis market larger than that for coffee, wheat, or corn 9 and explains why the three largest cannabis stocks now have a market capitalization of over US$30 billion and growing. 10 Cannabis usage Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug globally. According to Statistics Canada, nationally, 14% of Canadians aged 15 years and older reported some use of cannabis prod-ucts in the surveyed period (February to April 2018) ( Figure 1 ).11 Approxi- mately 8% of all users used some form of cannabis daily or weekly. 11 These are the important metrics be-cause they are most closely correlated to health risks. 12,13 If you're looking at this scientifi - cally, you might have an issue with the correlation of use to health risks, special feature Dr Ocana is an addiction medicine special- ist accredited by the American Board of Addiction Medicine and cofounder of the North Shore ADHD and Addiction Clinic. This article has been peer reviewed.Cannabis use by adolescents: Practical implications for clinicians A.M. Ocana, MD, CCFP, ABAMOver 99% of cannabis is derived from only two species with radically different chemical composition and medicinal properties. The primary chemical index that separates the strains is the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) to CBD (cannabidiol) ratio. higher in THC. Sativa is chosen for its psychostimulant properties. It lifts mood and improves cognitive and execu-tive function.Cannabis indica C. indica strains have less THC, allowing the CBD to dominate. It has primarily sedative effects. It improves sleep, relaxes muscles, relieves pain, and assuages anxiety. Which strain of cannabis do you use? How many days a month do you use? When you use, what are the positives? When you use, what are the negatives?When speaking to your patient about cannabis use, ask: BCMJ 2019;61:14-1915 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.orgbecause one \"daily user\" may smoke all day, every day, and another \"daily user\" may have a few puffs before bed. Nevertheless, the metric of \"how many times a week do you smoke\" is still valuable, because it allows you to subdivide users into three groups: Recreational: less experienced, use less than once per week, more likely to present with drug-induced psy-chosis and panic attacks. Social: moderately experienced, use mostly on weekends (1 to 2 times per week), more likely to experi-ence short-term impairment in cog-nition and productivity, least likely to present to you clinically. Medicinal: most experienced, self-medicate physical but also psycho-logical symptoms, most likely to experience withdrawal and long-term sequelae such as amotivation and chronic depression. Understanding cannabis If we are to make any sense of canna-bis clinically, we must first appreciate what the drivers are for youth using cannabis, and why they so passion-ately defend its use. The North Shore ADHD and Ad- diction Clinic, based in North Van-couver, British Columbia, provides longitudinal care under the Medical Services Plan. To help better under - stand cannabis use among adoles-cents, we identified 100 charts in our clinic's EMR of patients who met the following criteria: Age: 13 to 25 years old. Diagnosis: Cannabis use disorder, DSM-5 304.3. Date of first to October 2017. Inclusion criteria: Self-reported smok-ing cannabis > 20 days per month. Positive drug screen for cannabinoids. We used qualitative content ana- lysis using a standard approach. 14 Patients were asked standardized questions as part of a comprehensive mental health and addiction assess-ment at our clinic. The data were anonymized and deidentified of any demographic in - formation and exported from our EMR, Accuro, to a spreadsheet and then into narrative analysis software, QSR NVivo 11 for Mac. Coding and thematic organization was done by two blinded researchers from our clinic. Numeric data fields included a random numerical identifier and num-ber of days smoked per month. Narra-tive fields included type of cannabis smoked and patient-rated Cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa positive and negative effects. Clinical scenario: The reality of heavy cannabis use Monday morning, you walk into your office to meet an intelligent 20-year-old postsecondary student. She has been struggling with depression and difficulty concentrating, and is now on academic probation. She is brought to you by supportive parents after a brief episode of drug-induced paranoid de-lusions. Upon further questioning, she tells you that she finds school boring and she spends most of her waking hours on her phone, playing video games, and smoking cannabis. You, like most physicians you know, after summing up the available data, have developed a generally neg-ative view on cannabis as a cure-all, are avoiding discussing your views with patients because you don't feel well-enough informed, or are taking a wait-and-see approach. Now is the time to take a deep dive into cannabis. Cannabis botany Despite the huge variety of cannabis available, over 99% is derived from only two species with radically differ - ent chemical composition and medi-cinal properties. They are essentially polar opposites: C. sativa, which is a stimulant, and C. indica, which has primarily sedative effects. While extensive cross-breeding has entangled the species over the years, phytochemical, genetic, and clinical research continues to support their separation. 15 Cannabis chemistry The primary chemical index that sep-arates C. sativa and C. indica is the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) to CBD (cannabidiol) ratio. C. sativa-domin-ant strains are higher in THC. C. ind-ica strains have relatively less THC effect, allowing the CBD effect to dominate. 1530354045Positive Outcomes of C. indica Negative Outcomes of C. indica Positive Outcomes of C. sativa Negative Outcomes of C. sativaFigure 1.

Hybrids vary in their composi- tion of THC, CBD, and other canna-binoids. They are referred to by the dominant cannabinoid ratio inherited from their lineage, and they are often given colorful names such as Acapul-co Gold, Northern Lights, or Purple Kush. 16 Even today, no one really knows if THC and CBD are the most relevant cannabinoids. Significant data support the inclusion of multiple other active chemicals such as canna-bitriol and terpenes in some strains. 17 Cannabis neurobiology The different strains of cannabis ex-ert their psychoactive effects rela - tive to which cannabinoid receptors are stimulated or inhibited. The CB1 receptor is densely distributed pre-dominantly throughout the brain, while the CB2 receptor affects im - mune tissues and cells in the periphery. These receptors subsequently modulate neurotransmission in mul - tiple circuits: The increase in peripheral seroto-nergic tone is associated with pain relief, sedation, anxiolysis, and in the extreme, hallucinations. The stimulation of mesolimbic do-paminergic circuits is associated with the reward and psychostimu-lant effects. 18 The decrease in glutamatergic neu-rotransmission and the stimulation of GABA and various other per - mutations of circuits are associated with antinausea, mood-stabilizing, and antiseizure properties. Gluta-mate inhibition also explains how C. indica produces the \"turning off my brain\" effect that is so prized for its ability to promote sleep. 19 Cannabis as self-medication Adolescents don't choose to become addicted to cannabis. However, when they experience improved sleep or mood, or lessened pain, cannabis becomes their best friend and self-medication of choice, the synthesis of which usually cements their oppos-ition to further discussion. Self-medication is the most con- sistent theme in our patients' nar - ratives. As opposed to recreational users, chronic daily users specifically modulate three key factors to obtain their desired therapeutic effects: Strain (C. sativa versus C. indica ) Amount used Day or evening use Specifically, C. sativa is chosen for its psychostimulant properties. It lifts mood and improves cognitive and executive function. C. indica is generally experienced as sedating. It improves sleep, relaxes muscles, relieves pain, and assuages anxiety ( Figure 2 and Figure 3 ). This narrative from a 19-year-old daily cannabis user is typical of the cohort: \"I smoke sativa during the day. It is more stimulating and it helps me get things done. I smoke indica before bed. It relaxes my muscles and eventually helps me sleep. Psycho-logically, it slows down my thinking process and I feel subtly happier, and calm. The problem is, I wake up in a daze and I need a coffee to get out the door.\" Practical implication for clinicians These two strains of cannabis have radically different chemical compos-ition, medical properties, and neuro-biological effects. They are essentially opposites, a crucial insight unknown by most clinicians. 15 Therefore, it be- hooves clinicians to know the differ - ence and specify the strain. Similarly, research that has not segmented the data by strain are uninterpretable. When speaking to your patient about cannabis use, ask: Which strain of cannabis do you use? How many days a month do you use? When you use, what are the posi-tives? What are the negatives? In doing so, you will gain credibil - ity, laying the foundation for an ongo-ing therapeutic alliance. Heavy cannabis use is associated with multiple comorbidities. Screening for depression, anxiety, panic, ADHD, trauma, psychosis, and mania may help tease out the underlying cause for Figure 2.

A family history of substance use is not uncommon. 20 Dealing with misinformation As explained in the new video on the CMA website (www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMsypYm9Kho), \"Canna-bis may be legal, but it is not harmless because it can hurt your health, cause dependence, impair attention, mem-ory, and ability to make decisions, and make it hard to think, study, work, or cope.\" 21,22 Listing these facts to your patients will not likely be very fruit-ful because they may be operating under a number of false beliefs and rationalizations that contradict them. The three most commonly held false beliefs about cannabis are that it is not harmful, it is not addictive, and there are no withdrawal symptoms. False belief 1: Cannabis is not harmful The misperception that cannabis is not harmful is captured by Monitoring the Future , a cross-sectional survey of more than 250 000 American high school students that documents the steady decrease in perceived harmful-ness of cannabis in the last 10 years. 23It's true that, relatively speaking, the morbidity, mortality, and eco-nomic harm to society associated with other legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco dwarf those associated with marijuana use. 24 However, it's not rel- ative harm that matters, but absolute harm, specifically to the most vulner - able\u2014adolescents with mental health challenges. The first and most expensive harm of cannabis legalization, from the point of view of health authori - ties, will be felt in emergency depart-ments from the increase in poisoning, adverse events, and drug-induced psychosis. Researchers in Colorado found that the annual number of vis-its associated with a cannabis-related diagnostic code, accompanied by a positive marijuana urine drug screen, more than quadrupled between 2005 and 2014 (from 146 to 639). 25 That trend will continue because legalization has dramatically in-creased the number of novice users, who are more likely to underestimate the potency of their cannabis and are therefore responsible for most canna-bis-induced ER visits. The symptoms exhibited by these patients include nausea, vomiting, suspicion/paranoia, agitation, psychosis, and occasion-al respiratory depression, which, in combination with other drugs, can be life threatening. Edible cannabis products pose the greatest risk to the inexperienced. 26 Their presentation is purposefully misleading. They are often unlabeled and packaged as candy in the shape of lollipops or gummy bears. Health Canada, in consultation with experts, has published guidelines that will re-quire edibles to be sold in fixed dos-ages and, for the moment, edibles remain off the market. 27 Fixed dosages unfortunately do not make much difference to novices who still have not titrated dose to ef-fect. Getting edibles right is difficult for any user because the cannabinoids in edibles are absorbed through the GI tract, thus having a slower onset and longer-lasting effects. Given no way to predict the time of onset or gauge the intensity of effect, first-time users often eat too much initially or do not wait long enough for effects to take place before having more, sometimes leading to a hospital visit. It would be helpful to know, and as such be able to warn users about, which strains are particularly psychosis-inducing. False belief 2: Cannabis is not addictive The 20-year-old patient in our clin- ical scenario may point out that only 10% of those who experiment with cannabis get addicted to it\u2014less than cocaine, methamphetamine, or even alcohol. 28 This is true, but half of all those who use cannabis regularly be-come heavy users. And your patient by her own admission is a heavy user. You ask whether she experiences any negative effects, and she admits to the following: Significant impairment in her cog-nition, associated with social anxi-ety, academic underfunction, and decreased occupational productiv - ity, at least in the short term. Noticeable dysphoria upon quitting, special feature Figure 3. Number of references to positive and negative outcomes of C. sativa use among 100 patients (age 13-25 years) with cannabis use disorder. Question: \"What are the positive outcomes (both short and long-term) of the product(s) you use?

Since continued use (despite neg- ative consequences) is the de facto criteria for a substance use disorder, it would be fair to say that cannabis is addictive after all. 29 This would be a good time to dis- cuss SMART goals with your patient, an acronym that refers to patient-ini - tiated changes that are Specific, Mea-surable, Agreed upon, Realistic, and Time based. Motivational interview-ing might also be effective because it encourages accountability and explo-ration of patient motivation for using versus quitting. 30 False belief 3: There is no withdrawal from cannabis True, the experience of withdrawal is often less with cannabis than with other drugs. Cannabinoids are fat soluble and therefore stored in adi - pose tissue, including that of the testes and ovaries. Cannabis also has active metabolites, the combination of which results in slower decay of serum lev-els of cannabinoids, thus decreasing the experience of withdrawal. 31 However, the experience of with- drawal has changed over the years as the potency of cannabis has increased markedly. Forty years ago the average potency of smoked flower was 3% to 5% THC. In Colorado in 2015, the av-erage THC level in legal cannabis was 18.7%, with some 30%. Shatter, is potency cannabis results in higher serum cannabinoids levels, some of which decay quickly upon cessation of use, thus increasing the experience of withdrawal, dependence, addic-tion, and relapse. 32 At the moment, no one knows which strains are the most addictive. Here is a typical narrative from a daily cannabis user who recently quit: \"When I cut pot out completely, I be-came more anxious and found that I could not sleep, and that bothered me. When I started smoking again, I felt better, but then I felt like I was addicted and that's not really what I wanted.\" Addressing adolescent cannabis use disorder is a process. Inviting your patient to two or three further visits will give you the time to align and address the challenges together. Managing the impact of cannabis legalization Overall Canada's approach to can- nabis legalization gets high scores for prevention and harm reduction. Approaching this as a public health challenge, the federal government has sponsored cannabis education flyers, youth-oriented television ads, and videos on the Internet. The CMA has partnered with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and a number of other entities and has cre-ated sensible guidelines for safer con-sumption. 33 Local programs in British Columbia have done a masterful job of bringing mental health concepts into schools and creating a system of youth-oriented mental health clinics, known as Foundry. What Canada lacks, however, is a cohesive information technology (IT) system to measure and compare the impact of different strains of can-nabis, or the impact of treatment with cannabis compared with other inter - ventions (e.g., the benefits of canna - bis versus opiates to control chronic pain). More importantly, according to Harvard economics professor Mi-chael Porter, there is no way to com-pare the economic benefits of different interventions until we can collect pa-tient-centric metrics\u2014at the point of care, across the entire care journey. 34 Without such predictive analytics, it is impossible to determine, for ex-ample, the best approach to the opiate crisis. Should we prioritize training more addiction specialists, teaching firefighters to administer naloxone, paying family physicians to integrate mental health into workflow, or sup - porting the patient medical home? At the moment, mental health and addiction present an expensive, pain-ful, and unmanaged burden on soci-ety. We could probably do better if we knew what to do.

ABSTRACT: Amatoxins in Amanita phalloides, commonly known as the death cap mushroom, are responsi-ble for 90% of the world's mushroom-related fatalities. The most deadly amatoxin for humans is -amanitin, a bicyclic octapeptide that irrevers-ibly binds RNA polymerase II, thus preventing protein synthesis and causing cell death. Three recent poisoning cases in British Columbia show how the death cap can be eas-ily mistaken for edible mushrooms such as the puffball and the paddy straw mushroom. Since being intro-duced from Europe to the west and mid-Atlantic coasts of North Ameri-ca, A. phalloides has spread to south coastal BC, and has the potential to spread to vast areas of the continent. Following ingestion of A. phalloides, there is a latency period (6 hours) followed by intoxication, classically described as triphasic: a dysentery phase (6 to 24 hours), a false recov-ery phase (24 to 72 hours), and a hepatorenal phase (4 to 9 days) con-sisting of multisystem organ failure, seizures, coma, and death. Treatment is based on decontami- nation and liver transplantation if acute liver failure occurs. Manage-ment of the symptomatic patient consists of providing supportive care, promoting renal elimination of amatoxins, interrupting enterohe - patic recirculation of amatoxins, and administering proposed antidotes. Although no established antidote for A. phalloides has been identified, N-acetylcysteine and silibinin have This article has been peer reviewed.shown some benefit in a retro - spective survival analysis. With the expanded range of A. phalloides in BC, physicians should be alert to the possibility of amatoxin poison-ing and include it in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with gastroenteritis or hepatotoxic-ity and a history of ingesting foraged mushrooms. Amanita phalloides, commonly known as the death cap mushroom, is responsible for 90% of the world's mushroom-related fatalities. Management of symptomatic patients includes supportive measures, promoting renal elimination of amatoxins, and early consultation with a liver transplant centre.CliniCAl Present AtiOn is triPhAsiC: Dysentery phase6-24 HOURSthe world's most poisonous mushroom is growing in British Columbia hepatorenal phase4-9 DAYS False recovery phase24-72 HOURS Maxwell Moor-smith, Bsc, raymond li, Msc, Omar Ahmad, MD BCMJ 2019;61:20-2421 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.org The world's most poisonous mushroom, Amanita phalloides, is growing in BC Mr Moor-Smith is a medical student (class of 2020) in the University of British Colum-bia Island Medical Program.

He is also a clinical associate profes-sor in the Department of Emergency Medi-cine at the University of British Columbia.Amanita phalloides, known commonly as the death cap mushroom, causes life- threatening hepatorenal dysfunction when ingested. Considered the most poisonous mushroom in the world, A. phalloides contains amatoxins, a group of bicyclic octapeptides that are responsible for 90% of global mushroom-related fatalities. One cap of A. phalloides is sufficient to cause death in an adult. 1-3 The death cap was first introduced to British Columbia on the roots of imported European trees and has since spread to North American oak trees. 4,5 Death caps are now found in- creasingly in urban settings. In 2017 the Canadian Forest Service and Oak Bay parks department reported that death caps in the Victoria area sprout-ed earlier and in greater numbers than in previous years. 6 The spread of this invasive species has led to cases of morbidity and mortality from inges-tion of the mushroom and an ongoing risk of misidentification. Health care providers need to be aware of this risk, as prompt recognition and ap-propriate management are critical for positive patient outcomes. Distribution A. phalloides is not native to North America. First identified in Europe, the species has now traveled to Aus - tralia, Asia, Southern Africa, and the Americas on the roots of imported trees. 5 The first confirmed collec-tion of A. phalloides in North Amer - ica was in northern California at the Hotel Del Monte in 1935, a location famous for its exotic and unusual gar - dens. 5 Since then, the death cap has been introduced to multiple sites in the Pacific Northwest. A. phalloides specimens were first collected in BC in 1997 from under European chestnut trees at Lake Er - rock in the upper Fraser Valley. The first identification of A. phalloides in Victoria was in 1998 from under a large European beech tree on the landscaped grounds of Government House, the residence of BC's lieu-tenant governor. A. phalloides was detected in Vancouver in 2008 under European hornbeam trees that had been planted by the city in the 1960s. 4 Since these first specimens were collected, there have been numer - ous reports of A. phalloides found in Vancouver and the Fraser Valley, on Southern Vancouver Island, and on the Gulf Islands.As an ectomycorrhizal fungus, A. phalloides forms an obligate symbiot- ic relationship with the roots of trees, which have been mostly nonnative, broad-leaf trees. 4,5 This association may have limited the mushroom's spread so far. However, in Victoria A. phalloides has now been found in association with native BC Garry oak trees, which may allow the mushroom to expand its range even further. 4 Pringle and colleagues estimate the speed of A. phalloides spread among native California coastal oak at 5 km per year on average (range 3 to 9 km/year). 5 Additionally, predictive climate suitability mapping shows that most of south coastal BC is ap-propriate habitat for A. phalloides 5 (Figure 1 ). Mushroom foragers and health care providers should be aware of the expanded range for this highly toxic mushroom in order to prevent fatali-ties from the death cap in the future. 7 Figure 1.

Death cap mushroom, Amanita phalloides Known location, single site Known location, multiple sitesPotential distribution22 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.orgThe world's most poisonous mushroom, Amanita phalloides, is growing in BC Identification and misidentification A. phalloides typically grows from June to November in BC and looks different depending on its stage of maturity. The immature mushroom may be totally encased in a \"univer - sal veil,\" giving it the egg-like ap-pearance of a puffball mushroom if not cut in half to reveal the growing mushroom inside. As the mushroom matures, the universal veil ruptures and remains in the ground as a mem-branous sac (volva). The cap may grow up to 16 cm in diameter, becom-ing broad and slightly convex. The cap can be white or have a green or yellow hue, and is often darker in the centre. A. phalloides specimens typ - ically feature white gills and spores, a ring of tissue (annulus) near the top of the stalk, and a volva at the base 8 (Figure 2 ). Death caps can easily be misiden- tified as an edible variety of mush-room, as seen in three cases of amateur foragers who mistook the death cap for other species. In 2003 a 43-year-old man in Victoria con-sumed an immature death cap he thought was a puffball mushroom. In 2008 a 63-year-old woman in Van-couver consumed a mature death cap she assumed was a paddy straw mush-room, a common variety in Asia but one not native to North America. Both patients recovered following hospital - ization. In 2016 a 3-year-old boy died after consuming a death cap foraged from a residential street in Victoria. 4 Toxicity Three classes of toxins are present in A. phalloides: amatoxins, phallo- toxins, and virotoxins. Of the three, amatoxins exert the greatest ef-fect, and the most toxic for humans is -amanitin. 1,2,8 Like all the a RNA polymerase II, thus pre-venting protein synthesis and caus-ing cell death. None of the amatoxins are destroyed by cooking, drying, or freezing. The presence of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3) in hepatic sinusoidal trans-port of toxin into hepatocytes, causing massive centrilobular necrosis and vascular degeneration. 2,9 Amatoxins are primarily eliminated by renal ex-cretion, with a portion undergoing biliary excretion and enterohepatic recirculation. 9 The kidneys may also be affected and show signs of acute tubular necrosis and hyaline casts in the tubules. 2 Triphasic clinical presentation Symptoms following the ingestion of nonfatal mushroom species gener - ally occur within 6 hours. In contrast, symptoms of A. phalloides poisoning arise 6 to 24 hours after ingestion. Symptoms occurring within 6 hours of ingestion do not exclude the possi-bility of A. phalloides ingestion, how-ever, as multiple species of foraged toxic mushrooms are often ingested together. 3 After this initial latency period, there are three phases in the clinical presentation of A. phalloides poisoning. Most patients present in the first (dysentery) phase, which is character -ized by abdominal pain, vomiting, and severe, cholera-like diarrhea that may contain blood and mucus, and often results in profound dehydration. 2,10 The second (false recovery) phase occurs 24 to 72 hours after ingestion with the patient demonstrating symp-tomatic improvement despite clinical signs and biochemical markers of liv-er damage progressing, peaking at 60 to 72 hours after ingestion. 11 The third (hepatorenal) phase occurs 4 to 9 days after ingestion and is characterized by acute liver and multisystem organ failure that can lead to convulsions, hemorrhage, coma, and death. 2,3 Diagnosis and management Amatoxin mushroom poisoning can be fatal. The best prognosis results from prompt recognition and appro - priate management. The foundation of diagnosis is an accurate history and recognition of the toxidrome. Speci - mens or photographs of the mush-room consumed can help confirm the diagnosis, but often samples are par - tially decomposed or do not represent the ingested species. Assays to detect amatoxins are not available locally. 3 For asymptomatic patients, gas- trointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be con-sidered, even if the patient presents several hours after ingestion. 9 For symptomatic patients, management Figure 2.

No established antidote for ama - toxin poisoning has been identified. Several have been proposed, but their efficacy is not proven. A meta-analysis of 2108 hospitalized patients with amatoxin poisoning found therapies with silibinin or the hepatoprotectant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) were the most effective in a retrospective sur - vival analysis. 2 Silibinin (extract of milk thistle) inhibits OATP1B3 and prevents amatoxins into hepatocytes. 9 While intravenous silibinin (Leg-alon SIL) has been used in Europe for many years, in Canada it is only available through the Special Access Programme. Oral silibinin is avail-able at health food stores, but it may be inactivated when given with acti-vated charcoal. High-dose penicillin G and cyclosporine are other potential antidotes as they inhibit OATP1B3 and thus can prevent transport of amatoxin into hepatocytes. Penicillin has been one of the most commonly used therapies, despite showing lim- ited benefit in a retrospective sur - vival analysis. 2 Although the risks associated with high-dose penicillin (hypernatremia, seizures) are more significant than other proposed thera-pies, penicillin use can be considered for hepatoprotection if IV silibinin is not an option. 9 N-acetylcysteine is thought to limit hepatic damage through its free-radical or oxygen scavenging capa-bilities. Due to the benign side-effect profile of NAC, the benefits of its use are thought to outweigh any risks. 7,13 Once acute liver failure occurs, liver transplantation is the only defini-tive treatment. 1,3,10,14 Summary The physician's role in preventing fatalities from A. phalloides inges- tion lies in prompt recognition of amatoxin poisoning in a patient. Clin-icians should be particularly alert if the patient reports consuming for - aged puffball mushrooms or paddy straw mushrooms, as both of these mushrooms are known to resemble the death cap. With the expanded range of A. phalloides in BC, phys-icians should include amatoxin tox-icity in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with gastroenter - itis or hepatotoxicity and a history of ingesting foraged mushrooms. Management of the symptomatic pa-tient involves providing supportive measures, promoting renal elimina - tion of amatoxins, interrupting entero-hepatic recirculation of amatoxins, Provide supportive care Aggressively replace fluids and electrolytes. Patients may be severely dehydrated. Correct hypoglycemia and coagulopathy. 1,3,9,10,13 Promote renal elimination Establish and maintain brisk urine output with a minimum of 1.5 mL/kg/h, weighing the risks and benefits in patients who may not tolerate aggressive volume loading. 9 Although hemodialysis cannot remove amatoxin, it may be necessary as part of supportive care.2,7,10 Interrupt enterohepatic recirculation Administer multiple doses of activated charcoal. 1,3,9,10 Consider other interventions supported by anecdotal evidence: giving patients nothing by mouth, administering octreotide to sequester amatoxins in the gall bladder, initiating percutaneous biliary drainage. 9,14 Administer proposed antidotes Consider administering agents that block OATP1B3: intravenous silibinin, high-dose penicillin, cyclosporine. 2,7,9 Consider administering the hepatoprotectant N-acetylcysteine.2,7,9,13 Consult Contact local poison control: In BC, call the Drug and Poison Information Centre at 1 800 567-8911 (24 hours).

Lau, PhD, R.Psych, Sophy Davis, MPH Evaluation of a cognitive behavior therapy program for BC primary care patients with mild to moderate depression with or without anxiety: Bounce Back, 2008-2014 A telephone-supported self-help mental health program was found to be clinically effective after data were analyzed from the first 6 years of operation. ABSTRACT Background: Family physicians have an important role to play in accessing and coordinating com-munity mental health services and supports for patients affected by mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Bounce Back is a pro-gram introduced in British Columbia in 2008 to help physicians meet the mental health needs of their patients while lessening the demand on the health care system. The program of-fers cognitive behavior therapy to patients with mild to moderate de - pression with or without anxiety who might benefit from a low-intensity in-tervention. Clinical measures such as the Patient Health Questionnaire are used to determine patient eligi-bility and for ongoing assessment of mental health status. Patients are ineligible if they require more in-tensive mental health services (e.g., they have bipolar disorder or cogni-tive impairment) and may become in-eligible while in the program if their clinical presentation changes. Work-books for the program include care-fully sequenced questions designed to bring about change in how partici-pants think and in what they do to im-prove how they feel. Coaches trained by registered psychologists provide motivational support by telephone and communicate with the referring health professional to provide up - dates on the status of the patient. In 2017 a study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of this program using data from the first 6 years of operation. Methods: Data were collected for 25 338 patients with closed cases who were referred to Bounce Back from 1 July 2008 to 31 March 2014. Clinical outcomes were explored in terms of improvement, remission, and recovery from depression and anxiety over time. Recovery was defined using criteria from the UK National Health Services program, Improving Access to Psychologic-al Therapies, and presented as a percentage of patients who had scored in the subclinical range at completion after scoring in the clin-ical range at assessment. Means and standard deviations were calculated for patient age and clinical measure scores. Results: More women than men were referred to Bounce Back (74% vs 26%) and the mean age at refer - ral was 44.5 years. Four groups of patients were identified: declined (patients who did not receive fur - ther assessment or coaching), inappropriate (patients deemed in-eligible for the program), incomplete This article has been peer reviewed.Dr Lau is a clinical associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Uni-versity of British Columbia.

When preintervention and postint - ervention scores were compared, patients were found to have signifi-cant reductions in symptoms of de-pression and anxiety. A recovery rate of 68.5% was calculated, based on 5537 participants who initially had symptoms of depression, anxiety, or both, and 3794 participants who no longer had clinical symptoms after completing the program. Conclusions: Study findings show Bounce Back is associated with pos-itive outcomes for patients with mild to moderate depression with or with-out anxiety and that the program's clinical effectiveness is in line with initiatives assessed by other stud-ies. While the study had some lim-itations regarding the grouping of patients, only patients completing the program had both preinterven-tion and postintervention data, and the results would therefore not be affected by other possible group-ing methods, suggesting the out-comes for the completed group would remain unchanged. Like other large-scale initiatives being imple - mented to provide low-intensity mental health treatments, Bounce Back allows for earlier and easier access to services and better match-ing of service intensity to need.Background The impairment caused by depres- sion and anxiety cannot be under - estimated. Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey 1 revealed a 1-year prevalence of 5.4% for mood disorders and a lifetime prevalence rate of 12.6%. Of those affected, 50% report some degree of impact on their ability to work and 35% report signifi-cant interruptions to employment in the past. 2 The negative impact of de- pression on job performance has been estimated to exceed that caused by chronic conditions such as arthritis, hypertension, back problems, and diabetes. 3 Further, mood and anxiety disorders are strongly associated with chronic health conditions, 4 showing a bi-directional relationship in which these disorders both contribute to and result from physical illness and pain. 5 Despite the collective efforts of na-tional, provincial, and local govern-ments, timely and appropriate access to high-quality mental health services remains a critical issue in Canada and a treatment gap exists. Primary care is the cornerstone of the health care system and the access point for the majority of Canadians with mental health challenges. In a study examining the records of over 300 000 Canadian patients who had at least one encounter with a primary care provider, 14% had a diagnosis of depression. 6 In another Canadian study, 20% of all general practitioner visits were found to involve mental disorders. 7 Individuals with mild to moderate depression with or without anxiety identified in a primary care setting may not obtain a referral to specialized mental health services be-cause their symptoms are not severe enough, leaving the primary care pro-vider with limited options. Given the need to improve the detection of men-tal health and substance use problems and the prevalence of mild to mod-erate depression, family physicians have an important role to play in ac-cessing and coordinating community mental health services and supports, a critical issue recognized by the Brit-ish Columbia Practice Support Pro-gram (www.gpscbc.ca/what-we-do/longitudinal-care/incentive-program/mental-health-initiative) and addres-sed to some extent by programs such as Bounce Back. Bounce Back program Bounce Back was launched in 2008 by the Canadian Mental Health Asso-ciation (CMHA) BC Division using a $6-million grant from the BC Min-istry of Health. The objective was to develop community-based infrastruc-ture for improving access to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) interventions that would help family physicians meet the mental health needs of their patients while lessening the demand on the health care system. With a brief format that is well suited to pri-mary care, CBT is known to be an ef-ficacious intervention for depression and anxiety, 8 and many CBT-based programs around the world have demonstrated effectiveness in non-randomized studies. 9 The Bounce Back program oper - ating in BC today is free to patients referred by a general practitioner, nurse practitioner, or psychiatrist. As of January 2017, over 40 000 referrals to Bounce Back had been received from more than 2000 physicians and clinics across the province. Since 2015, Bounce Back has also been im-plemented in several health regions in Manitoba and Ontario. Eligibility. Patients are screened for eligibility upon referral and then dur - ing an initial assessment. Bounce Back is not designed for individuals experi-encing severe symptoms, so eligibil - ity criteria are in place to ensure that 27 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.orgEvaluation of a cognitive behavior therapy program for BC primary care patients with mild to moderate depression with or without anxiety: Bounce Back, 2008-2014 only patients who might benefit from a low-intensity intervention can access the program. Once enrolled, patients continue with the program unless their clinical presentation worsens in a way that means more-intensive mental health services are required. Patients were excluded from the program if they had: A diagnosis of bipolar disorder or psychosis (past or present). A diagnosis of personality disorder. Any diagnosed cognitive impair - ment or organic brain syndrome. Patients were also excluded if they were misusing drugs or alcohol, or if they had active suicidal ideation. (See www.bouncebackbc.ca for cur - rent referral form.) Workbooks. The CBT intervention offered by Bounce Back is delivered in a series of workbooks based on a self-help resource developed in Scot-land: Overcoming Depression, Low Mood and Anxiety: A Five Areas Ap-proach. 10 The workbooks describe CBT strategies using jargon-free text written at a grade 8 reading level, and include carefully sequenced ques-tions designed to bring about change in how participants think and in what they do to improve how they feel. Coaching. The workbooks are com - plemented by telephone coaching provided by paraprofessionals: indi-viduals trained by registered psychol-ogists employed by CMHA to deliver Bounce Back as a supported self-help intervention. 11 These coaches do not engage directly in psychotherapy with the participants but instead provide motivational support as participants learn from the workbooks. Coaches receive ongoing clinical consultation support from registered psychologists retained by Bounce Back as well as program adherence rating for quality control purposes.Clinical measures. Bounce Back relies on clinical measures to assess mental health: the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), the Gener - alized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Ques-tionnaire (Q-LES-Q). The nine-item PHQ-9 measures the persistence of each symptom in the DMS-IV diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. Scores range from 0 to 27, with levels of se-verity classified as minimal (0 to 4), mild (5 to 9), moderate (10 to 14), moderately severe (15 to 19), and se-vere (20 to 27). Scores from 5 to 27 may require treatment, depending on the patient's duration of symptoms and functional impairment. Sev-eral studies support the validity and reliability of the PHQ-9 and have found it can be administered over the phone. 12-14 The PHQ-9 is commonly used to screen for depression in pri - mary care settings.15,16 The seven-item GAD-7 ques- tionnaire screens for anxiety and as-sesses severity in clinical practice and research. Scores range from 0 to 21, with levels of severity classi-fied as minimal (0 to 4), mild (5 to 9), moderate (10 to 14), and severe (15 to 21). Several studies have demon-strated good reliability and validity for the GAD-7 when used in a general population. 17 The 16-item Q-LES-Q asks pa - tients to rate aspects of life, including their physical health, mood, work, household activities, and social rela-tionships. 18 Item scoring ranges from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good) and reflects the degree of enjoyment or satisfaction experienced during the past week. Total scores are indicative of overall quality of life. In addition to these three clinical measures, Bounce Back patients are assessed using participant self-ratings for mood (1 = very poor, 10 = very good) and physical health (1 = very poor, 5 = very good) in the past 2 weeks. Service flow. Once a referred patient is accepted and a coach is assigned, an initial telephone assessment occurs. The coach administers the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and Q-LES-Q and asks the patient for mood and physical health ratings. Information on suicide risk is collected and, if present, reported to the registered psychologists serv - ing as clinical consultants, who assess risk and confirm eligibility. If Bounce Back is deemed suitable for the pa - tient, two introductory workbooks are provided and the patient contin - ues with the program, eventually re-ceiving additional workbooks and up to four more standard telephone ses-sions. During these short sessions (15 to 20 minutes each), coaches help the patient understand workbook mate-rials and goal setting. Coaches also identify further areas of need, address questions, and motivate patients to stay on track. The patient may choose to exit the program at any point. The PHQ-9, GAD-7, and Q-LES-Q are administered during the comple-tion session, and mood and physical health ratings are obtained. Within 6 months of completion, the patient is entitled to two \"booster\" sessions to maintain the gains made in the program. Throughout the program, coaches communicate with the refer - ring health professional to provide updates on the status of the patient and to report any changes in suicide risk that may require further care. Need for evaluation In 2017 Bounce Back was known to be a well-established part of primary care in BC, but the effectiveness of the program had not been evaluated. To address this research gap, a study 28 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.orgwas undertaken to determine wheth- er participants who completed the Bounce Back program experienced a significant reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms and showed an improvement in overall quality of life. Methods Data were collected for 25 338 pa - tients with closed cases who were referred to Bounce Back from 1 July 2008 to 31 March 2014. These pa-tients had been screened for Bounce Back using the eligibility criteria that applied at that time: they were age 19 or older, they were experiencing mild to moderately severe symptoms of de-pression as defined by a score of 19 or lower on the PHQ-9, 2 and they were able to use the self-help materials and take part in telephone coaching 3 (i.e., they could read English, had a tele-phone, and could communicate using it). Clinical outcomes were explored in terms of improvement, remission, and recovery from depression and anxiety over time. Improvement was defined as reduction of symptoms and increases in general health cal - culated using the difference between preintervention and postintervention scores on clinical measures and the effect size of the difference. PHQ-9, GAD-7, and secondary outcome score differences were calculated as preintervention scores subtracted from postintervention scores for each individual. Paired sample t tests were used to calculate a mean difference and 95% confidence interval. Effect size (Cohen's d ) was calculated by dividing mean difference scores by the paired sample standard deviation. Recovery was defined using cri- teria from the UK National Health Services program, Improving Ac-cess to Psychological Therapies (IAPT). 16,19 Participants were con - sidered clinically depressed if they had a PHQ-9 score of 10 or higher, and were considered to have anxiety if their GAD-7 score was 8 or higher. Participants diagnosed at assessment with clinical depression, anxiety, or both were considered recovered at completion if they scored below the clinical cutoff on both the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Recovery was presented as a percentage of patients who had scored in the clinical range at assessment and then scored in the subclinical range at completion. No identifying patient data are stored in the database other than in-itials. When a date of birth is entered, the database automatically converts it to age, and the actual date of birth is not stored in the database. No ethics approval was obtained for this study. Data were analyzed using GNU PSPP software. 20 Means and standard deviations were calculated for patient age and clinical measure scores. One-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) was used to determine differences between groups at baseline, with Scheff\u00e9's method as a post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Results Four groups of patients were identi-fied based on the services they re-ceived and how their cases were closed ( Figure 1 ). These groups were designated as declined, inappropriate, incomplete, or completed. The declined group (n = 8100) included eligible patients who did not receive any further assessment or coaching after explicitly or implicitly communicating a wish not to proceed or after contact with the patient was lost. The inappropriate group (n = 1931) included patients deemed ineligible for the program based on referral form criteria (n = 1233) or coach as-sessment (n = 637), and patients who Evaluation of a cognitive behavior therapy program for BC primary care patients with mild to moderate depression with or without anxiety: Bounce Back, 2008-2014 Figure 1.

The incomplete group (n = 8104) included patients who received some service but did not formally conclude the program with a coach; they either explicitly left the program or were as-sumed to have worked independently on the intervention materials. The completed group (n = 7203) included patients with preinterven-tion and postintervention scores for all clinical measures. Patient characteristics An analysis of patient characteristics found that the average age of refer - ral to Bounce Back was 44.5 years, and that more women (74%) than men (26%) were referred ( Table 1 ). ANOV A results for both age and sex showed there were significant differ - ences among groups at alpha level .05. Specifically, Scheff\u00e9's post hoc criterion for significance indicates that patients in the completed group were older than those in other groups by 4.6 to 6.7 years (group mean differ - ences), and patients in the inappropri-ate group were significantly younger by 1.0 to 6.7 years. The completed group consisted of 3% to 6% more women than other groups. Depression medications were used by 45% of all study participants, anxiety medication by 32%, and 25% used both medica-tions. (Medication use data were col-lected via the referral form, although no additional detail as to the nature of the medications was collected.) There were significant differences in medication use among groups. In the inappropriate group, there was a 5% to 10% higher proportion of de-pression medication use and a 4% to 8% higher proportion of combined medications use compared with all other groups. A smaller proportion of patients in the completed group were on medication compared with those in the incomplete group, but there was no significant pairwise difference in medication use between patients in the completed and declined groups. Baseline scores Clinical measure scores for all pa - tients at referral and assessment dif-fered ( Table 2 ). PHQ-9 referral scores had 64% missing data overall due to incomplete referral forms. For other measures, data were over 94% com-plete for patients in the incomplete and completed groups. At referral, the mean PHQ-9 score for the entire sam-ple was 12.96 (SD5.07) on a 27-point scale, with the inappropriate group having a higher mean than the other groups (mean16.4, SD 6.0, P < .001). For clinical measures taken at the assessment session by the coach, there were statistically significant pairwise differences among all groups for all measures except for GAD-7. Overall at baseline, patients in the completed group showed lower PHQ-9 scores and better ratings for mood, physical health, and life satisfaction than those in the incomplete group.

For anxiety, however, patients in the incomplete group showed the highest mean scores compared with other groups (group mean differences between 0.4 and 0.7 points). Preintervention and postintervention scores The preintervention and postinter - vention scores of patients who com - pleted the program with a coach indicate significant improvements in symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as quality of life and mood ( Table 3 ). All paired mean differences were found to be statistically signifi-cant at P < .001 and clinically import-ant with Cohen's d > 1. Fewer clinical cases of depression were identified in participants completing the pro-gram: 17% (1231/7203) at postint-ervention assessment compared with 62% (4470/7203) at preintervention assessment. Similarly, fewer clin-ical cases of anxiety were identified: 20% (1422/7181) preintervention as-sessment. Of 5537 participants who were either depressed or anxious or both initially, 3794 no longer showed clinical symptoms after the program, meaning an IAPT recovery rate of 68.5%. At an individual patient level, the mean difference between preinter - vention and postintervention PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores showed a 5-point decrease or the equivalent of a one-category reduction in symptoms. Other clinical measures also showed improvement. When outcomes were stratified by baseline severity, effectiveness was shown to be more prominent in participants with more severe initial symptoms ( Figure 2 ). For PHQ-9 rat- ings, mean score reduction ranged from 0.51 (d = 0.19) in the minimal depression group to 12.35 (d = 2.13) in the severe depression group. Simi - larly, for GAD-7 ratings, mean score reduction ranged from 0.76 (d = 0.34) in the minimal anxiety group to 9.54 (d = 1.89) in the severe anxiety group. However, as baseline severity increased, the variability in effective - ness increased as well. Conclusions In analyzing the first 6 years of ad-ministrative data from Bounce Back, we found that patients who completed the program demonstrated significant improvement in secondary outcomes, including overall quality of life, and significant improvement in the pri - mary mental health outcomes of de - pression and anxiety measured by PHQ-9 and GAD-7, with a recovery rate of nearly 69%. This is higher than the 46% to 56% recovery rates reported for some stepped-care in-itiatives in the UK. 19,16 The Bounce Back effect sizes were also signifi-Evaluation of a cognitive behavior therapy program for BC primary care patients with mild to moderate depression with or without anxiety: Bounce Back, 2008-2014 Figure 2.

Hans and Hiller9 found that for patients completing face-to-face CBT interventions for depression, ef-fect size was d = 1.13 (95% CI, 1.02-1.24), the same as our result based on PHQ-9 score changes. Other stud-ies cited by Hunsley and colleagues 8 found that for generalized anxiety disorder, treatment effect sizes were d = 0.92 and d = 0.89, less than the Bounce Back result of d = 1.08. The higher anxiety mean scores among patients in the incomplete group could be due to a lack of anx-iety-specific materials or due to levels of anxiety among participants that im-peded continuing with the program. (In 2016 more workbooks for the core anxiety module were introduced in an attempt to improve outcomes for par - ticipants diagnosed with anxiety.) Overall, the amount of improve - ment increased relative to baseline severity, a finding that is consistent with the stepwise increase in effect-iveness observed in meta-analyses by Driessen and colleagues 21 and by Bower and colleagues.22 There are likely other factors contributing to these improvements as well, includ-ing regression-to-the-mean effects, as pointed out by Hunsley and col-leagues. 8 However, as with other effectiveness studies using within-group analyses for preintervention and postintervention patients, it was not possible for our study to quantify the influence of other factors the way randomized controlled trials can. Study limitations This study had some limitations. The administrative data for Bounce Back were collected for ser - vice delivery rather than research and were subject to changing definitions. The four groups used for this evalua - tion (declined, inappropriate, incom - plete, and completed) did not permit identification of specific, clinical rea-sons for patients disengaging with the intervention. Other groupings are possible that may affect baseline characteristics and attrition patterns. However, only patients completing the program had both preinterven - tion and postintervention data and the results would therefore not be af-fected by other grouping methods, suggesting the outcome data for the completed group would remain un - changed. Additionally, because this was not a randomized controlled trial, other reasons may account for the ob-served improvements. The materials used in the Bounce Back program during the study may also have been a limiting factor. The mean age of participants completing the study was older than in other stud-ies (age 48 versus age 38 9), and while this may indicate that diagnosis is late in BC, it may also indicate that pro-gram materials were better suited to older participants. Adapted program materials for youth were introduced after younger patients became eligible for Bounce Back in December 2016. Positive impact Bounce Back has had a positive im-pact on the lives of BC residents with mild to moderate depression with or without anxiety by improving their symptoms and quality of life. Our study results showing the clinical ef-fectiveness of Bounce Back are in line with results from other CBT ef-fectiveness studies. Our results also show that while the intervention can be effective for individuals experiencing severe symptoms, the variability in improve-ment is larger as well. The inability of patients to engage with program ma-terials while dealing with concurrent disorders or active suicidal ideation supports excluding them from low-intensity intervention such as Bounce Back, and should prompt the primary care physician to seek more appropri-ate treatment. Like large-scale initiatives being implemented elsewhere 23,24 to expand the delivery of low-intensity mental health services within stepped-care models, Bounce Back is allowing for earlier and easier access and better Evaluation of a cognitive behavior therapy program for BC primary care patients with mild to moderate depression with or without anxiety: Bounce Back, 2008-2014 Patients who completed the Bounce Back program demonstrated significant improvement in secondary outcomes, including overall quality of life, and significant improvement in the primary mental health outcomes of depression and anxiety.32 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.orgmatching of service intensity to need, and thus reducing the mental health treatment gap .

Judy Dercksen, MD Chronic pain can present in many forms, from migraines to plantar fasciitis, and the number of people suffering from pain, currently one in five, is expected to increase. Websites and social-media platforms focused on pain can enhance chronic pain management for many people. 1 Past president of the Ameri- can Academy of Pain Medicine, Dr Lynn Webster, put it best, \"Complex problems require complex solutions.\" Webster pointed out that, \"In the USA in 2000, there were 1000 multidis-ciplinary programs. Today there are 200.\" Incongruously, as the number of pain clinics in the USA has decreased, the annual number of opioid prescrip-tions for pain relief has increased. 2 In a policy statement released in July 2017, Doctors of BC called for improvements in chronic pain man-agement. 3 Of note, the statement pushed for improved access to chron-ic pain specialist services, which cur - rently can have wait times of up to 2 years. Family doctors can help pa-tients while they wait, and since close to 90% of patients have some form of digital access, 1 they can access free pain websites such as those from Pain BC (www.painbc.ca), Self-Management BC (www.selfmanagementbc.ca), and Pain Improvement (www.pain improvement.com), all of which are geared to augment office-based pain management. Such self-management programs have proven benefits. 4 Professor Patrick McGowan rec- ognized 30 years ago that patients need to take charge of their own health. Expanding on programs stud-ied at Stanford, he created the Self-Management BC program launched by the University of Victoria in 2002. McGowan, director of the program, \"felt the need to lower the risk of pa-tients having to face the crippling con-sequences of poorly managed chronic diseases.\" McGowan estimates that between 3000 and 3500 people par - ticipate in the program every year, and that half of the patients are seek-ing improved pain control. Having worked as a family doctor for over 30 years, I understand how easy it is to neglect certain aspects of chronic pain management. In a busy clinic, it is challenging to address the complex needs of patients suffering with chronic pain. I have learned that the most valuable resource can be the informed patient. Patients who are taught skills to cope with their symp-toms are more likely to take charge of their own health. 5 Many physicians are not aware of Self-Management BC's new telephone-based program aimed at supporting patients in their homes, the Health Coach Program, which thousands of patients with all types of chronic diseases have participated in. The program is supported by recruit-ed volunteers who are given a 2-day training course and paired with pa - tients. The volunteers call the patients once a week for 6 months to provide support. I learned of this program from a patient who was referred to me by a chronic disease nurse in our commu-nity. The patient's pain and anxiety had noticeably improved by the time I saw her, and she attributed the im-provement to the support she received from her coach. Other self-management programs also exist (see Box). Charles Labun, coordinator of the Interior Self- Management Program, notes that the various Self-Management BC pro-grams have been well received by Dr Dercksen is a family physician working in rural BC. She is a graduate of the Uni - versity of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, and a fellow of the College of Family Physi-cians of Canada.

The educa- tion and support provided increase patient readiness for change. Chronic pain requires a multimodal attack, and even if patients are unable to afford private services, like physiotherapy, massage, or chiropractic treatments, self-management programs augment office-based medical care. Family physicians and health care providers can reassure patients, once any serious pathology has been ex-cluded, that accessing the available free programs could help them im - prove their pain. By improving pain control, it is possible to decrease the risk of substance abuse and improve the quality of the lives of families liv-ing with people suffering from chron-ic pain. When a patient presents with severe, even unbelievable pain, a trusting doctor-patient relationship is essential, as fear and anxiety in-crease pain. Patients are often terri-fied that their medications are going to be withdrawn or reduced. Recent evidence supports the finding that the vast majority of older patients with moderate to severe pain are under - treated, 6 and physicians are reluctant to prescribe opioids to patients who have addictions (or a history of addic-tions) even if they have moderate to severe chronic pain. 7 Dr Lynn Web- ster has highlighted the challenges physicians face with the opioid regu-lations: \"We as physicians are forced to be the judge and law enforcement. . . . We are required to be in an adver - sarial role for our patients. This is the antithesis of healing and jeopardizes the doctor-patient relationship.\" Instead, physicians can empha- size the need for partnership in their patients' care. They are in the ideal position to stress the importance of self-management programs as part of a pain plan. As patient self-efficacy improves, opioids can be reduced or, when indicated, switched to safer options, like buprenorphine. Appro-priate treatment reduces the risk of patients in chronic pain suffering be-cause of undertreatment or turning to drugs available illegally. BC offers a wide variety of in- valuable tools. I have found the RACE phone line to be a readily ac-cessible gold mine of information. The addictions specialist I spoke with has helped me transition patients from high doses of morphine and hydro-morphone to buprenorphine. I have patients with addiction problems now coping so well with their pain that they are able to attend mental health and addiction counseling. The General Practice Services Commit - tee's Practice Support Program and website have also improved physi-cians' abilities to manage pain. Pain BC provides education, support lines, and online physician and patient workshops. Self-Management BC has group meetings for patients, on-line workshops, and telephone coach-ing. The Divisions of Family Practice website includes a number of resourc-es and division-created tools for pain management. The Northern Interior Rural Division of Family Practice, hoping to see more activation of these resources in areas of Northern BC and Williams Lake, has sponsored a pro-gram aimed at increasing awareness of the ways to help patients and fami - lies improve their quality of life. Pain improvement.com is geared toward patients who are not computer sav-vy. Podcasts and simple navigation choices help guide patients through a pain-management journey that will support resources provided by Pain BC and Self-Management BC. The battle against chronic pain has to be fought on all fronts. The complex problem of chronic pain and addiction is inadequately managed with medication alone. Physicians need not feel alone in this struggle.

Born in Manchester, England, Neil attended Cambridge University and qualified as a medic-al doctor in 1959. He and his young family then spent 3 years in northern Kenya, where he served diligently as the only doctor for a remote area. After also working as a doctor in Swansea, Wales, for 2 years, Neil and his family immigrated to Ques-nel, BC, in 1965. Neil embraced the Cariboo and it embraced him. He de-voted the remainder of his medical career to this region, specializing as an internist and becoming a found-ing member of the International Col-lege of Hospice/Palliative Care in 1995, where he was instrumental in bringing a multibed hospice unit to Quesnel. He is fondly remembered by patients and medical staff alike as a gentle, intelligent, devoted doctor who treated everyone with compas-sion, grace, and strength. Neil retired in 2002, and in 2008 he and his wife, Eva, moved to Creston, BC, where he continued his commitment to pal-liative care by serving on the local Hospice Society Board and success-fully bringing two hospice rooms to the Creston Valley Hospital. Neil is survived by his daughter, Theresa (David) Metzger, and his sons, Marcus (Janice) Barber and James (Ila) Barber. He is also sur - vived by his sisters, Julie (Richard) Williams and Linda Allatini (Antho-ny) Wilson and his grandsons, Wes (Alaina), Daniel, Michael, William, and Jon. Neil joins his beloved wife of 60 years, Eva, who passed away in 2017. A special thank you to the nurses and doctors at the Creston Valley Hospital, and to Father Syl-vester Obi Ibekwe of the Holy Cross Catholic Church, for their loving care and support during Neil's fi-nal days. Funeral services were held at the Holy Cross Catholic Church in Creston on 23 Novem-ber (www.gfoliverfuneralchapel .com/notices/Neil-Barber). Neil was laid to rest beside Eva at the For - est Lawn Cemetery in Creston, BC.

He fell in love with motor - cycles, bought a couple, and ventured through the Pacific Northwest, some-times with his wife, Joan, sometimes alone, and sometimes with his biking buddies. And of course he took a mo-torcycle repair course so that he could do his own repairs. He idolized his family. He adored Joan, his wife of 47 years, who was his best friend and confidante. Joan and Alan were devoted parents to Drew (Ashley) and Katie (Chris). They are entitled to be very proud of both of them. He adored his two grandchildren, Jayden and Kennedy. He also will be greatly missed by his sister, Eileen Cook of Calgary. Alan was an incredible human. The world is a better place as a re-sult of his being. He will be missed. He was a life role model for all of us. Despite all his amazing talents, his mischievous smirk will be missed the most. \u2014Grant Gibbings, MD White Rock Dr Alexander Leiper Robertson1925-2018 Dr Alexander Leiper Robertson was born in the family home at the corner of Rumble Street and Patterson Av-enue in Burnaby on Robbie Burns's birthday. Alex completed his pre-med BA at UBC in 1949 and was prompt-ly accepted into medical school at the University of Western Ontario in London. After second year he elected Dr James Alan Pretty 1945-2018 Dr James Alan Pretty passed away peacefully at Irene Thomas Hospice on 1 August 2018. Alan was courage-ous and graceful in facing death from a glioblastoma multiforme. His dig-nity in death was a reflection of his life as a son, brother, husband, father, physician, leader, teacher, colleague, and friend. Alan graduated from UBC in 1970 at the top of his medical class. He interned in San Diego. He stud-ied internal medicine at VGH and in Edinburgh before he was lured into family practice, initially as a locum, at Hilltop Medical in White Rock in 1973. In a very short time, Hilltop Medical and the Peace Arch Hospi-tal community recognized that an ex-ceptional individual had arrived. He settled into the community with ease. Despite his extraordinary intellect he always treated his fellow physicians as equals (even though we were not). He was a physician role model. He was an excellent listener, compas-sionate to his patients, and a good communicator. His clinical medicine was above reproach, and his patients loved him. Medicine was his pas-sion. He spent several years as medi-cal director at Peace Arch Hospital and always had the respect of his fellow physicians, administrators, and the hospital board. He was able to navigate those treacherous waters without compromise but with respect from all sides. Alan recognized early that com- puterization of medical records was important in good quality medical care. As a result he was instrumen-tal in Hilltop Medical becoming fully computerized by 1997, well ahead of the curve across Canada. He was on the steering committee of the software company developing medical records for computers in those early days, and he took university computer program-ming classes to better understand the process, often with classmates 20 or more years younger. During the twi-light years of his medical career, Alan traveled to the Northwest Territories to work as a locum (mainly in Hay River). He came to adore the North, with its beauty and solitude, and the northern communities' culture and ambience. When Alan traveled he al-ways made enduring friends, and this included the medical, nursing, and support staff in the North. He em - braced frontier medicine. Early to rise and never one to waste a moment, Alan had many im-pressive interests outside of medi-cine. He learned to sail in San Diego, and this skill took him to the South Pacific into the treacherous waters off Indonesia and Southeast Asia. He was away for a number of months on a small sailboat with one other adventurous soul. He was a skillful woodworker and built furniture and kayaks. He planned and built his own homes. He spent many hours kayak-ing off BC's coast with friends. He was an expert skier. He was on the ski patrol at local mountains and en-joyed the Whistler terrain. He was a naturally talented painter. He was a scuba diver. Alan traveled extensively both with his family and as a volunteer physician in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia with organiza - tions delivering care to the less fortu-nate of our world. During these times he would take Spanish classes, some-times for weeks. One of his volunteer assignments required that he learn Continued from page 3537 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.orgto take a sailing sabbatical to refine his maritime skills and to earn his fare in the family bakery. One year later, refocused, he returned to complete his medical degree in 1952. In the course of his medical stud- ies, his Plymouth Brethren connec-tions introduced him to a dazzling debutante, Doris Nugent. Cupid did not waste any arrows! He and Do-ris fulfilled their matrimonial vows on 24 March 1956, and the magical union endured 62 years, until Alex's death. Initially, the newlyweds rent-ed an apartment in Vancouver. After their first son, John, was born 1\u00bd years later, they constructed their ar - chitecturally designed home on Brae-mar Avenue in Burnaby with a $5000 mortgage; raised their three children, John, Rosemary and Mark; and lived there for the next 54 years. After graduation, Alex returned to the West Coast to set up his fam - ily practice in Burnaby. There, he had privileges at Burnaby Hospital, where he also served as chief of staff. Early in his career he crossed paths with Dr Kurt Gottschling at the Salva - tion Army Outpatient Medical Clin-ic, where Alex was volunteering and Kurt was in the final weeks of his in-ternship. On 1 July 1961 they formed a professional association that flour - ished until Alex retired in 1990 on his 65th birthday. Over almost 3 decades of association, Kurt had high praise for his colleague: \"Like in any pub-lic office, people in charge sometimes meet with difficult problems. With wisdom and persuasion, Alex man-aged them all. He was smart, knowl-edgeable, and wise. He had empathy for the downtrodden. His sympathetic nature was well known and appreci-ated by his patients. He was moral, conscientious, and guided by his Christian faith.\" It did not take long before Alex and Kurt had acquired more associ-ates and were challenged for space. In 1972 Dr Cliff Silverthorne joined the group. His business expertise and po-litical moxie were instrumental in lo-cating a favorable site for expansion. Over the years the Royal Oak Medical Clinic was the office location for Drs Bond, Hiller, Wagar, Jones, Dublin, Hanam, and Foggin. Alex was a man who embodied the word gentleman. As a physician, his gentle and healing ways and qui-et words of comfort and compassion earned the loyalty and love of his pa-tients. Alex always had a listening ear for his friends and family and made a point of seeking out those who were perhaps forgotten by others. Alex was also a man of faith and great personal integrity. He was a faithful supporter of youth and uni-versity work through the Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship (specifically Pi-oneer Pacific Camp and SFU IVCF), as well as the Union Gospel Mission. Alex had a passion for gardening, golf, sailing, traveling, and his fam-ily. This was witnessed by the neat-ness and beauty of his yard, sailing journeys on Tradewind II, golfing on Fridays with his Killarney Park buddies, and the annual May long- weekend family getaways. Alex and Doris have left an amaz - ing legacy in their five remarkable grandchildren, Emily, Camille, Fio-na, Michael, and Cameron. Alex is deeply missed by his family, friends, and colleagues. It is only fitting that his lifelong partner in practice has the final word: \"We loved Alex and we know that he loved Jesus as his Lord and Savior. He will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\" \u2014Rosemary Bell \u2014John The BCMJ invites writing sub- missions from student authors, and each year awards a prize of $1000 for the best medical student submission accepted for print and online publication.

Work-related asthma can be cate- gorized as either occupational asthma or work-aggravated asthma (some-times referred to as work-exacerbated asthma), and accounts for 5% to 20% of new adult-onset asthma. 1,3-5 Occupational asthma can be due to sensitization to one or more agents or irritants in the workplace. Asthma related to sensitization to a chemical in the workplace is referred to as sen-sitizer-induced occupational asthma. Through repeated exposure to po - tential sensitizers (often for months or years), workers can develop sen-sitization, and upon re-exposure, may experience asthma symptoms. Workers often report typical symp-toms of asthma at the workplace, with improvement away from the workplace. Exposure to an irritant, in the ab- sence of sensitization, can also induce a form of asthma termed irritant-induced asthma or reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS). The classic criteria for RADS include: A history of new-onset asthma. Symptom-onset related to a single high-level exposure. Onset of symptoms within 24 hours of exposure. Exposure to a high concentration of gas, fumes, or a spray-known irritant. Airway hyper-responsiveness or re-versible airflow obstruction. Work-related asthma This article is the opinion of WorkSafeBC and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.worksafebc Recovery can be prolonged (more than 3 months) or can lead to persis- tent asthma.5 Work-aggravated asthma is pre-existing asthma aggravated or exacerbated by work exposure to irritants. More than 300 substances have been identified as being causally as-sociated with asthma, the majority being sensitizers. 1,2,4 Common sensi- tizers seen in BC include plicatic acid (Western Red Cedar) seen in sawmill workers and diisocyanates seen in spray painters, chemical manufac-turing, foundry, and other industries. For a list of agents associated with occupational asthma by occupation, visit www.csst.qc.ca/en/prevention/reptox/occupational-asthma/Pages/occupational-asthma.aspx. Diagnosis Asthma is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome primarily affecting the lower respiratory tract character - ized by episodic or persistent symp-toms of wheezing, dyspnea, and cough. The diagnosis of asthma re-quires these symptoms and dem-onstration of reversible airway obstruction using spirometry and/or methacholine challenge testing. A negative spirometry result does not necessarily exclude the diagnosis of asthma, and if clinical suspicion re-mains high, either repeat spirometry or methacholine challenge may be indicated. 1,2 After a diagnosis of asthma has been made, the next step is to deter - mine if it is work-related. Of note, spirometry testing may be negative away from the workplace/exposure. As a result, peak flow metres or spi - rometry testing may need to be com-pleted in relation to the workplace to confirm the work relationship. Fur -ther testing to confirm sensitization may sometimes be required and may be carried out by specialists in occu-pational medicine. If you would like your patient to be seen by a consul-tant specialist from WorkSafeBC Oc-cupational Disease Services, please indicate this on your Form 8/11 and an occupational disease medical advi-sor will be in touch with you. A claim for asthma requires objec- tive evidence such as that confirmed through pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry, pulmonary function test-ing, and/or methacholine challenge testing. In the case of work-aggravated or irritant-induced asthma, with ap-propriate medical treatment and ap-propriate mitigation of work triggers, many workers can continue in their job. However, if occupational asthma is strongly suspected, particularly sensitization-related occupational asthma, removal from the workplace is the recommended course of ac-tion. If a worker is unable to continue working at their present place of em-ployment due to work-related asthma and the claim is accepted, vocational rehabilitation is the next course of ac-tion. While fit-tested respirators may mitigate symptoms from irritants, even exposure to a small dose of a sensitizer, once sensitized, may pro-duce symptoms and respirators may not be of benefit. For more information or assistance If you would like to speak with an occupational diseases medical ad-visor, or you have further questions regarding an asthma claim, please contact a medical advisor in your nearest WorkSafeBC office. \u2014Brian E. Ng, MD, MPH, CCFP WorkSafeBC Medical Advisor References on page 4039 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.orgcouncil onhealth promotion The lived experience of people with dementia The most common degenera- tive brain disease causing de-mentia was identified by Dr Alzheimer in 1906. The Alzheimer Society of Canada was not founded until 1978. The society initially fo-cused on educating the public that dementia was not a normal part of ag-ing. The first support group for people with dementia was not formed until 1993, and it was 2003 before a per - son with dementia sat on the society's Board of Directors. Books about dementia initially fo- cused on the disease, the caregiver's journey, and perspectives about the patient's journey. Only in the past few years have memoirs been written by people with dementia. This pattern is a symptom of the stigma supporting the idea that a person with dementia dies inside a living body. Medicine has done little to reduce this stigma; written material focuses on losses from the disease seen from a professional perspective. It is time for medical professionals, and society in general, to learn from qualitative studies about the experience of people actually living with dementia. A meta-synthesis (from 2018) of the lived experience was derived from 626 individuals in 34 studies from various countries. 1 The introduction is particularly meaningful: \"The way certain conditions and phenomena are understood and conceptualized, shape professional approaches to treatment and sociocul-tural perceptions of those experienc-ing them. This in turn has implications in terms of the experience of individu-als living with a condition.\" 1 The study found three major themes. First, people with dementia live with constant change due to the loss of cognitive capacity and altered perceptions of the physical environ-ment. Second, they strive for continu-ity by using a variety of coping skills. Those who adapt well have their iden- tity invested in more than cognitive skills, and demonstrate resilience. The third theme is the double-edged impact of the environment, which consists of interpersonal relationships and the physical environment. A posi-tive environment allows people with dementia to continue participating in life, and includes caregivers who fa-cilitate retaining control and a sense of agency\u2014key to a person's experi-ence of dementia. This echoes Kitwood's research into maintaining personhood in de- mentia.2 He concluded that personhood is \"a standing or status that is bestowed upon one human being, by others, it implies recognition, respect and trust.\" Kitwood describes the following ways in which people act that undermine a person with dementia's personhood: ignoring (conversing with others as if This article is the opinion of the Geriatrics and Palliative Care Committee, a subcom-mittee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opinion of Doctors of BC. This article has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.the person is not present), infantiliz - ing, disempowering (no unsupervised walking), objectification during per - sonal care, withholding, and imposing. Through recognition, collaboration, negotiation, facilitation, validation, celebration, as well as adapted physi - cal environments (dementia villages) we can enable people with dementia to continue to live meaningful lives. In a systematic review of 27 studies on positive experiences with demen-tia, 3 the authors found three themes across the experiences. First, they fo-cused on aging well (as opposed to fo-cusing on their dementia) by seeking pleasure and enjoyment and continu-ing to do what was important to them with the support of their loved ones. Second, they faced their challenges with hope and humor as opposed to focusing on loss. Third, they gave thanks through life review and cited personal growth from the illness, in-cluding preserving their identity. Education and training in demen - tia care must emphasize the obligation we have to maintain not just the basic biological and physical needs of peo-ple with dementia, but also the higher needs\u2014social activity, sense of be-longing, self-esteem, and meaning in life. Maslow's hierarchy of needs has been adapted for dementia and serves as a reminder that care must focus on more than basic needs. 4 While I am not trying to romanti - cize dementia, these studies indicate that how dementia is managed has a significant impact on how people with dementia perceive themselves and their life. As physicians, the care we provide must recognize person-hood. As citizens, we should advocate for community services and facili-ties that allow people to continue to lead meaningful lives.

Many are simply posted on the Inter - net rather than being published in scholarly journals; thus, they escape the notice of medical databases such as Medline. Additionally, the US National Guideline Clearinghouse (www.ahrq.gov/gam/updates/ index.html) was shut down in 2018 after US federal funding was cut. So what is left? Here are some recom-mended sources. CMA CPG Infobase (www.cma .ca/En/Pages/clinical-practice-guide lines.aspx) is a free directory of guidelines from the last 5 years by Canadian health organizations. Giv-en that the small number of Cana-dian clinical practice guidelines can be hard to find in the larger volume of international content, a Canadian source such as this is crucial. ECRI Institute. The ECRI In- stitute is building a free directory of clinical practice guidelines, the ECRI Guidelines Trust (https://guidelines .ecri.org). US National Guideline Clearinghouse records were not made available, so the new direc-tory must be built from the ground up. The directory includes summa - ries and links to full-text documents, and ratings on trustworthiness. Free registration is required. International Guideline Li - brary. The International Guideline Library (www.g-i-n.net/library/international-guidelines-library) is a public directory from the not-for-profit Guidelines International Net - work. The linking function requires a membership, but consider using the site as a search tool and then lo-cate the full-text guidelines using a title search in Google, or ask your li-brary for a copy. Medline. While incomplete, Medline remains a worthwhile site for locating clinical practice guide - lines. Using PubMed.gov (www.ncbi .nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), in the search results, limit the Article Types to \"Guideline.\" National Institute for Health and Care. Results from the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's Evidence Search (www .evidence.nhs.uk) can be filtered for guidelines. Finally, explore the guidelines cited in point-of-care tools such as DynaMed, UpToDate, or BMJ Best Practice, and try using Internet search engines such as Google.

Nevertheless, lead toxicity still occurs. A 64-year-old male was seen in emergency rooms throughout the Lower Mainland over the course of 5 months, complaining of abdominal pain, dizziness, weight loss, and nau-sea. Intensive workup for abdominal pathology, including CT, MRI, and upper- and lower-gastrointestinal scopes, was negative. Bloodwork showed a normocytic anemia. After nearly two dozen medi- cal visits, a consulting internist con-sidered lead toxicity as a unifying diagnosis and ordered a blood lead analysis, which showed significantly elevated blood lead at 5.60 umol/L (115.94 ug/dL). The BC Drug and Poison Information Centre was con-tacted, and chelation therapy with succimer was arranged; the patient's symptoms resolved over the next few months, and his blood level decreased to 0.99 umol/L (20.5 ug/dL). The patient had been taking an ayruvedic herbal remedy purchased in India to treat his type 2 diabetes. A laboratory analysis determined that each tablet contained approximately 12.5 mg of lead. The patient had been taking two tablets daily for many years, yielding a sustained daily ex-posure of 25 mg. The patient discontinued taking the herbal remedy, and 3 months later his presenting symptoms had not re-turned; blood lead levels however, re- bc centre for disease control Toxic lead exposure via an unusual source: New BC reporting regulations may prevent similar cases bounded slightly as equilibrium was reached between excretion and bone stores. Health Canada was notified regarding the herbal medication and issued a foreign product alert detail-ing the risk (http://healthycanadians .gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc -sc/2018/68602a-eng.php). The two BC laboratories that test clinical samples for metals ana-lyze just over 2600 blood lead, 1800 blood mercury, and 110 urine mer - cury samples every year. Some of those samples are screening tests based on presumed exposure to met - als at the workplace. Few of those tested have results as striking as the patient described above, whose high and ongoing lead exposure resulted in significant morbidity. His case, how-ever, is not unique and points to the need to follow up on high-level metal biomarker test results for the opening they offer into family and commu-nity exposures, which in the absence of investigation and testing may pass unnoticed. As part of new regulations under the BC Public Health Act, as of 1 Jan-uary 2019, laboratories testing BC pa-tients and paid for by public insurance are obliged to report all analyses of lead and mercury in blood and urine to the BC Provincial Health Officer, who has delegated the receipt, inves-tigation, and surveillance of results to the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) acting in concert with re-gional health authorities. BCCDC will assess trends in testing and in metal biomarker levels by geography and demography, and for those 100 or so results per year above an investiga - tion/action threshold, will contact the ordering clinician and through the cli - nician the patient, to assess the like-ly source of exposure. BCCDC will work with the two BC testing labora-tories, Doctors of BC, WorkSafeBC, medical health officers, and envi-ronmental health officers in health authorities, the Provincial Health Of-ficer, and privacy experts to ensure that the system works effectively in pinpointing to whom and where high-level exposures to mercury and lead occur, in order to trigger early inter - vention and prevent additional toxic heavy metal exposures. \u2014David McVea, MD University of British Columbia Public Health and Preventive Medicine Residency \u2014James Lu, MD Medical Health Officer, Vancouver Coastal Health \u2014Morris Pudek, MD Regional Medical Discipline Leader, Clinical Chemistry, Vancouver Coastal Health \u2014Benjamin Sehmer, MD Internal Medicine, Richmond Hospital \u2014Tom Kosatsky, MD Medical Director, Environmental Health Services, BCCDC This article is the opinion of the BC Centre for Disease Control and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.As of 1 January 2019, laboratories testing BC patients and paid for by public insurance are obliged to report all analyses of lead and mercury in blood and urine to the BC Provincial Health Officer.42 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.orggpsc Maternity patients who do not have a family doctor (or whose family doctor does not provide obstetrical care) can expe-rience significant barriers in accessing consistent care during their pregnan-cy.

Doctors Helping Doctors44 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.orgnews Vitamin D recommendations for people living with MS The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada released evidence-based rec-ommendations for vitamin D supple-mentation and maintenance of vitamin D serum levels to help people affected by multiple sclerosis. Research has shown a strong link between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of developing MS. The recommenda - tions provide information for at-risk populations as well as people diag-nosed with MS. The document also highlights comorbid conditions and information on toxicity associated with vitamin D supplementation. The recommendations are endorsed by The Canadian Network of Multiple Sclerosis Clinics and The Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers. Canadians are particularly vul- nerable to vitamin D deficiency due to our geographical location. Canada has one of the highest rates of mul-tiple sclerosis in the world with 11 Canadians diagnosed with the dis-ease every day. People with biologi-cal family members who have MS are at higher risk of developing the disease. In addition to decreasing the risk of developing MS, vitamin D may beneficially modify the course of MS. Other lifestyle factors that could modify a person's risk of developing MS include past exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, smoking and secondhand tobacco exposure, and obesity. Gen-erally, adults with MS and those at risk for MS should consume between 600 and 4000 IU of vitamin D daily to ensure sufficient intake to achieve the target serum level status. The MS Society of Canada is in- vestigating vitamin D protocols in each province to determine next steps in their advocacy efforts for Canadi-ans with MS. Visit https://mssociety .ca/hot-topics/vitamin-d to read more about vitamin D and the MS Society's recommendations. PD Connect: Parkinson disease referral program PD Connect is a referral program in- tended to help health care profession-als connect individuals diagnosed with Parkinson disease, and their care partners, to Parkinson Society British Columbia's support services at the time of diagnosis or at any point in the disease's progression. What does PD Connect do for patients? Expedites access to community-based support services for individu - als who have recently been diag-nosed with Parkinson disease. Offers proactive consultations and counseling to individuals affected by Parkinson disease, including care partners and family members. Empowers social connection through provincial support groups. Navigating the numerous types of insurance out there can be a confusing and even overwhelming process. The lay-person's summary below will hopefully make this a less daunting task. Life insurance pays your loved ones a lump sum in the event you pass away before a certain age. For exam-ple, Doctors of BC offers plans with a payout of up to $5 000 000 in the event of death before age 75, as well as options to be covered permanently (i.e., until you pass away, at whatever age). Disability insurance pays you monthly if you are no longer able to earn an income (or your full income). The BC government provides \"free\" coverage for physicians with a payout of up to $6100 monthly, but a disability income insurance plan could get you up to an additional $18 900 monthly (as offered by Doctors of BC). Critical illness insurance pays you a lump sum if you receive a critical diagnosis like cancer or Alzheimer dis-ease. For example, Doctors of BC offers plans that cover 25 critical conditions with a payout of up to $250 000.Professional expense insurance, going a step be - yond disability insurance, reimburses you monthly for professional expenses (office rent, employee salaries, accounting fees, association dues, etc.) when you face a disability. With a Doctors of BC plan, for example, you could be reimbursed up to $20 000 monthly for 15 months. Accidental death and dismemberment insurance pays a lump sum to you in the event of an accident costing you a body part, or to your loved one if you pass away due to an accident. Insurance policies include many details (the fine print) and optional add-ons (riders). For personalized information to suit your needs, contact Doctors of BC at 604 638-2904 or insurance@doctorsofbc.ca to speak with a licensed, noncommissioned insurance advisor. \u2014Jessie Wang Medical Student Intern, Doctors of BCIs your insurance know-how up to date?45 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.org The youth suicide rate decreased, and although the gap with other BC residents did not quite meet the tar - geted 50% reduction it did decline substantially (by 38%).

BC Indigenous health improves, gap widens A 10-year undertaking to track In- digenous health in BC has found improvements in five key areas; how-ever, the gap between the health status of Indigenous and non-Indigenous residents continued to widen in three of those areas. A report released by the First Na- tions Health Authority and the Office of the Provincial Health Officer sum-marizes the results of tracking life expectancy, mortality, youth suicide, infant mortality, and diabetes rates between 2005 and 2015. Key findings include: Life expectancy among Status First Nations people improved between 2005 and 2015, but the life expec -tancy for other residents of BC im-proved at a faster rate, so the health status gap actually widened. The age-standardized mortality rate, which measures death from all causes, improved somewhat since 2005, but the health status gap increased. Continued on page 46 Recently published BC guidelines Thyroid Function Testing in the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Thyroid Function Disorder (2018) This is a revision of the 2010 version of the guideline. The guideline's scope has expanded to include pediatric and pregnant patients.Key recommendations: Routine thyroid function testing is not recommended in asymptomatic pa-tients (outside of the BC Newborn Screening Program). Testing may be indicated when nonspecific symptoms or signs are present in patients at risk for thyroid disease. A TSH value within the laboratory reference interval excludes the major - ity of cases of primary thyroid dysfunction. If initial TSH testing is normal, repeat testing is unnecessary unless there is a change in clinical condition. Measurement of fT3 is rarely indicated in suspected thyroid disease. Screening for undiagnosed hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism should not be performed in hospitalized patients or during acute illness unless hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism is the suspected cause of the clinical presentation or represents a significant comorbidity. If a woman is pregnant or planning pregnancy, TSH testing is indicated if she has specific risk factors (see Table 3 in the guideline). Other key changes: A laboratory algorithm has been added to the guideline and outlines changes to ordering. If central hypothyroidism is being investigated \"sus-picion of pituitary insufficiency\" should be included as a clinical indica - tion and a request for fT4 (with or without TSH) should be indicated in the space provided on the standard outpatient laboratory requisition. Thyroid function test reports in BC will include trimester-specific refer - ence intervals on all women of childbearing age. Ultrasound Prioritization (2018) This new guideline summarizes suggested wait times for common indica - tions where ultrasound is the recommended first imaging test. The purpose is to inform primary care practitioners how referrals are prioritized by radi-ologists, radiology departments, and community imaging clinics across the province. In some cases, notes and alternative tests are provided for addi-tional clinical context. This guideline is an adaptation of the British Col-umbia Radiological Society (BCRS) Ultrasound Prioritization Guidelines (2016). See also the one-page overview: Ultrasound Prioritization Guideline Summary.

The diabetes prevalence rate con-tinued to increase for both popula-tion groups, but the rate of increase for First Nations people declined, resulting in an overall decrease in the health status gap that exceeded the 33% reduction target. The Transformative Change Ac- cord: First Nations Health Plan com-mitted First Nations leadership and the Governments of British Columbia and Canada to achieve specific health targets by 2015 on seven core health indicators. The Office of the Provin-cial Health Officer and the First Na - tions Health Authority have agreed to continue to jointly monitor the health and well-being of First Nations peo-ple in BC for the next 10 years with an expanded suite of 22 indicators of health and well-being, called the In-digenous Population Health and Well - ness Agenda. The 22 indicators that will be tracked and reported on regularly over the next decade include measures de-veloped in consultation with First Na-tions communities, such as cultural wellness, community strength and resilience, and ecological health. Cul-tural wellness, for example, will be a combined indicator reporting on tra-ditional language, traditional foods, traditional medicine/healing, and a sense of belonging to one's First Na-tions community. The baseline report for the Indig- enous Population Health and Well - ness Agenda will be released in 2019. Read the full 2018 Report on Indig-enous Health and Well-being at www .fnha.ca/about/news-and-events/news/indigenous-health-improves -but-health-status-gap-with-other -british-columbians-widens.news Drawing better than writing for memory retention Older adults who take up drawing could enhance their memory, accord-ing to a new study from the Univer - sity of Waterloo. Researchers found that even if people weren't good at it, drawing, as a method to help retain new information, was better than re-writing notes, visualization exercises, or passively looking at images. As part of a series of studies, the researchers asked both young people and older adults to do a variety of memory-encoding techniques and then tested their recall. The research-ers believe that drawing led to better memory when compared with other study techniques because it incor - porated multiple ways of represent-ing the information\u2014visual, spatial, verbal, semantic, and motoric. The researchers compared different types of memory techniques in aiding reten - tion of a set of words in a group of undergraduate students and a group of senior citizens. Participants would either encode each word by writing it out, by drawing it, or by listing physi-cal attributes related to each item. After performing each task, memory was assessed. Both groups showed better retention when they used draw-ing rather than writing to encode the new information, and this effect was especially large in older adults. Retention of new information typ- ically declines as people age due to de-terioration of critical brain structures involved in memory such as the hip-pocampus and frontal lobes. In con-trast, visuospatial processing regions of the brain, involved in representing images and pictures, are mostly intact in normal aging and in dementia. Melissa Meade, PhD candidate in cognitive neuroscience at Water - loo, conducted this study with Myra Fernandes, a psychology professor in cognitive neuroscience at Waterloo, and recent UW PhD graduate Jeffrey Wammes. The study, \"Drawing as an encoding tool: Memorial benefits in younger and older adults,\" appears in Experimental Aging and Research.

To be held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, this course is designed to assist clinicians in man-aging the most challenging of pain patients\u2014patients with complex chronic pain. Complex chronic pain infiltrates multiple dimensions of the patient's life. Because of this, opioids are less effective in treating a patient's distress. The conference assumes a basic knowledge of opioid prescrib-ing principles and does not focus on the nuts and bolts. Rather the focus is on defining the proper role of opiates and other modalities in the manage-ment of complex chronic pain.

Several times a year, the BCMJ presents a theme issue devoted to a particular discipline or disease entity. We welcome letters, blog posts, articles, and scientific papers from physicians in British Columbia and elsewhere. Manuscripts should not have been submitted to any other publica-tion. Articles are subject to copyediting and editorial revisions, but authors remain respon-sible for statements in the work, including edi-torial changes; for accuracy of references; and for obtaining permissions. The corresponding author of scientific articles will be asked to check page proofs for accuracy. The BCMJ endorses the \"Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publi-cation of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals\" by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (updated December 2016), and encourages authors to review the complete text of that document at www.icmje.org. All materials must be submitted electroni- cally, preferably in www.bcmj.org EDITORIAL PROCESS Letters to the editor, articles, and scientific papers must be reviewed and accepted by the BCMJ' s eight-member Editorial Board prior to publication. The Board normally meets the last Friday of every month, at which time sub-missions are distributed for review the follow-ing month. We do not acknowledge receipt of submissions; the editor will contact authors of articles by e-mail once the submission has been reviewed by the Board (usually within 8 to 10 weeks of submission). The general criteria for acceptance include accuracy, relevance to prac-tising BC physicians, validity, originality, and clarity. The editor contacts authors to inform them whether the paper has been rejected, con-ditionally accepted (that is, accepted with revi-sions), or accepted as submitted. Authors of let - ters are contacted only if the letter is accepted and editorial staff need further information. Sci-entific papers and other articles typically take 5 to 10 months from the date of receipt to publica - tion, depending on how quickly authors provide revisions and on the backlog of papers scheduled for publication.

Read the article: bcmj.org/news/ mitochondrial-disease-resourceBC Medical Journal @BCMedicalJournal 54 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.orgWhat profession might you have pursued, if not medicine? Radio broadcast journalism. Specific- ally, compiling and reading the news on public radio. Which talent would you most like to have? The ability to write stories that move readers emotionally and allow them to see life in astonishingly different ways. What do you consider your greatest achievement? As a person of color, my move to Can- ada from Apartheid South Africa was a spiritual revelation. Who are your heroes? People around the world who shoul-der the burden of grinding poverty with quiet dignity and grace.Proust questionnaire: Dr Bruce Phillipsback page Dr Phillips works as a full-time pediatrician in the BC Children's Hospital emergency department.What is your idea of perfect happiness? Being in a quiet shady garden with a glass of wine, contemplating new growth. What is your greatest fear? Losing my faculties and becoming a burden to myself, those close to me, and to society. What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? My inability to plan my life. What characteristic do your favorite patients share? As a pediatrician, I admire those par - ents who silently, by their mere pres- ence and subtle body language, impart a sense of security and confidence to their children. Which living physician do you most admire? Dr Hilton Ling. He was there as the cool role model staff guy when I was doing my surgical rotation as a fresh-faced intern in South Africa. He oper - ated on my brother's hemorrhoids. He was here 30 years later, operating on my spouse's heart at St. Paul's. Thin-ner of hair but still the cool dude. What is your favorite activity? Working in an overplanted, over - grown garden with shady moist spots for moss and ferns. And maybe a glass of wine after. Which words or phrases do you most overuse? \"Amazing!\" Multiple times a day, but as a tribute to my life\u2014never without really feeling the emotion that goes with it! What is your favorite place? A quiet secret clearing in Stanley Park near the tennis courts. A shady tree in a pool of sun, perfect with a book on a summer's day. What do you most value in your colleagues? Kindness, respect, empathy, and the feeling that I belong to an intimate family at work. What are your favorite books? Rediscovering Charles Dickens and his exquisite use of language and plot. Anything by Salman Rushdie. What is your greatest regret? Arriving late to meet my parents at the airport on their visit to Vancouver from South Africa. It was their very first time flying, half a world away from where they started. I found them eventually\u2014huddled, bewildered, and exhausted, and relieved to see me. What is the proudest moment of your career? I feel pride every time a learner ex- presses appreciation for having a comfortable, safe learning environ-ment, which I attempt to provide for them, and seeing them flourish. How would you like to die? With acceptance, grace, and dignity. 55 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 1, january /february 2019 bcmj.org doctorsofbc.ca/club-mddoctorsofbc.ca/opus doctorsofbc.ca/parknfly doctorsofbc.ca/amjEnjoy a free room upgrade on all room categories through March 31, 2019.
