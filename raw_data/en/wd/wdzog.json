Studies have shown that hypertension (one of the comorbidities) is a risk factor for patients with severe COVID-19. There have been more patients with hypertension among those who succumbed to COVID-19 compared to the survivors. There is no proven treatment of COVID-19 as of now. Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, has permitted use of traditional systems of medicine for treating mild to moderate cases of COVID-19. In line with this, there are few case reports which reported promising results for treatment of COVID-19 with Ayurveda. These treatment reports highlighted subdued COVID-19 infections without developing serious complications. The present case is of a young hypertensive female patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19. Ayurvedic assessment for this was Kaphavataj jwara. The patient sought Ayurvedic treatment. She was advised the treatment module including medicines, diet and behavioral interventions. Though patient was having comorbid hypertension with major COVID-19 symptoms, she recovered with exclusive Ayurvedic treatment both physically as well as psychologically with no post COVID-19 complications till date. Ayurvedic treatment module appears to be safe and efficacious with early recovery and better outcomes. Keywords: Ayurveda; COVID 19; Case report; SARS-CoV-2; Traditional medicine. \u00a9 The Authors.
