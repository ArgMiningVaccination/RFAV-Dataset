This study assessed reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy using the I-Change Model (ICM) by considering the role of informational and psychosocial factors. A cross-sectional online survey using a convenience sample was conducted among Dutch adults (n = 240). The questionnaire assessed information factors, predisposing factors, awareness factors, motivational factors, preparatory actions, and vaccination intention. Vaccine hesitant participants (n = 58, 24%) had lower levels of education, more often paid work, and tended to have a religion other than Catholicism. They used written media less often and tended to visit websites of public health organizations less often, but used messaging services like WhatsApp more frequently. All participants had neutral intentions towards checking information credibility. Vaccine hesitant respondents had less knowledge about vaccination, lower perceived severity of getting sick and dying of COVID-19, and reported fewer exposures to cues about the advantages of COVID-19 vaccination. They were less convinced of the emotional and rational advantages of COVID-19 vaccination and expressed more negative feelings about it. They also reported more negative social norms concerning COVID-19 vaccination, and lower self-efficacy to get vaccinated and to cope with potential side-effects. The regression model explained 58% of the variance in vaccination intention. The results suggest that strategies are needed to: 1. Reduce fake news and stimulate information checking to foster well-informed decision-making; 2. Target both rational and emotional consequences of COVID-19, in addition to strategies for optimizing levels of knowledge. Campaigns should acknowledge the perceptions of the emotional disadvantages and increase perceptions of emotional advantages of COVID-19 vaccinations, such as reducing feelings of regret, and increasing feelings of freedom and reassurance.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-03-09", "cleaned_text": "COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: The Role of Information Sources and Beliefs in Dutch Adults [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063205](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063205) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-ijerph-19-03205)], and a relatively high vaccination level in the Netherlands has been realized, resulting in full vaccination of 84% in the Dutch population of 12 years and older [ [2](#B2-ijerph-19-03205)]. Yet, COVID-19 keeps resulting in new waves of mortality and morbidity due to new mutations and vaccine hesitancy [ [2](#B2-ijerph-19-03205), [3](#B3-ijerph-19-03205), [4](#B4-ijerph-19-03205), [5](#B5-ijerph-19-03205)]. Vaccine hesitancy (VH) can be described as a person's uncertainty about whether to get vaccinated or not [ [2](#B2-ijerph-19-03205)]. [6](#B6-ijerph-19-03205)]. An important characteristic of social media concerns the development of information bubbles [ [6](#B6-ijerph-19-03205)], which are particular spheres of information that persons have access to resulting from algorithms selecting information based on prior content interactions of the user. This may lead to people seeing information that confirms what they already believe in [ [7](#B7-ijerph-19-03205)]. Additionally, the online environment also contains so-called fake news, which may heavily influence COVID-19 VH [ [8](#B8-ijerph-19-03205)]. Fake news, or misinformation, is information that cannot be verified or is not evidence-based [ [9](#B9-ijerph-19-03205)]. The increasing uncertainty about the trustworthiness and credibility of news sources is problematic, as it may encourage an increase in VH and decreased trust in the government [ [10](#B10-ijerph-19-03205)]. Previous research suggests that people may be more susceptible to fake news, and therefore VH, if they do not know how to properly navigate the Internet [ [11](#B11-ijerph-19-03205)]. In this regard, taking preparatory actions against misinformation may help people to lower the impact of fake news on the Internet. Social media plays a vital role in the creation and spread of fake news, as information free of restrictions can easily be spread. A recent investigation of fake news on social media showed that 80% of it is created by 0.1% of all accounts [ [12](#B12-ijerph-19-03205)]. This study also suggested that 80% of that news is consumed by 1% of all accounts [ [12](#B12-ijerph-19-03205)], which may be problematic for VH when the affected individuals spread the incorrect information in their social environment. This is known as second-hand misinforming [ [12](#B12-ijerph-19-03205)]. [13](#B13-ijerph-19-03205)], increasing the chance of second-hand misinforming. Consequently, the spread of fake news via social media and interpersonal communication may influence various individual and social determinants of VH. Among the personal determinants, knowledge [ [14](#B14-ijerph-19-03205)], risk perception [ [15](#B15-ijerph-19-03205)], and attitudes toward vaccination [ [16](#B16-ijerph-19-03205)] were associated with COVID-19 VH. Furthermore, a review on the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine identified ten thematic categories of VH determinants [ [17](#B17-ijerph-19-03205)]. The emerging determinants across these categories were risk perception, perceived advantages and disadvantages (i.e., attitudes), knowledge, and perceived social norms [ [17](#B17-ijerph-19-03205)]. Hence, to optimize communication and to better reach people that are hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccination, targeted approaches are needed that address the relevant beliefs about it. [18](#B18-ijerph-19-03205)]. The ICM suggests that awareness, motivation, and action concerning health promoting behaviours can be explained by information factors (e.g., choice of Internet sources, message quality) and predisposing factors (e.g., gender, age, education) (see [Figure 1](#ijerph-19-03205-f001)). The awareness of a particular health issue (e.g., the need for COVID-19 vaccination) is suggested to be determined by knowledge (about the vaccination), perceived cues (events that guide behaviour), risk perception (a person's perceived severity of a health threat and their perceived susceptibility to the threat) and cognizance (a person's awareness of their own level of health behaviour). These awareness factors influence motivational factors such as a person's attitude (towards vaccination), social norms and support (towards vaccination), and self-efficacy (the confidence a person has to overcome barriers that may hinder a health promoting behaviour, such as vaccination) [ [19](#B19-ijerph-19-03205)]. These factors determine a person's level of motivation towards health promoting behavior or their intention to engage in it. Translations from intention to behaviour can be facilitated by preparatory planning, i.e., choosing relevant action plans, and coping plans to overcome barriers that may hinder a person's action plans [ [19](#B19-ijerph-19-03205)]. The relevance of these post-intentional constructs has previously been demonstrated for health behaviours such as inspecting risks for hereditary cancer [ [20](#B20-ijerph-19-03205)], physical activity [ [21](#B21-ijerph-19-03205)], and children's vaccination uptake by parents [ [22](#B22-ijerph-19-03205)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Design 2.2. Study Population 2.3. Questionnaire [18](#B18-ijerph-19-03205), [19](#B19-ijerph-19-03205), [20](#B20-ijerph-19-03205), [21](#B21-ijerph-19-03205), [23](#B23-ijerph-19-03205), [24](#B24-ijerph-19-03205)]). The questionnaire was piloted for comprehension and content by individuals from the target group and adjusted according to participants' feedback. These participants were not eligible to fill in the final online questionnaire on Qualtrics. The average time to complete the questionnaire was 15 min. 2.3.1. Vaccine Hesitancy [25](#B25-ijerph-19-03205)] using seven items ( = 0.93), assessing a general vaccination intention (3 items; = 0.97) and a COVID-19 vaccine-specific intention (4 items; = 0.87). Low scores reflect greater VH. 2.3.2. Socio-Demographic Factors [24](#B24-ijerph-19-03205)]. Participants were asked to indicate their age, their gender (1 = male, 2 = female, 3 = other), their highest completed education (1 = no education, 2 = primary school, 3 = lower vocational education, 4 = lower level secondary school, 5 = middle vocational education, 6 = higher level secondary school, 7 = higher vocational education, 8 = scientific education), their working situation (1 = working 1-11 h per week, 2 = working 12-19 h per week, 3 = working 20-31 h per week, 4 = working 32 or more h per week, 5 = retired, 6 = unemployed, 7 = disability pension, 8 = receiving financial aid from the government, 9 = being a homemaker, 10 = student) (more than one answer could apply) and their religion (0 = not religious, 1 = Protestant, 2 = Catholic, 3 = Muslim, 4 = Anthroposophist, 5 = other; for the regression analysis the coding was: 0 = not religious, 1 = Catholic; 2 = other religions) (see Table 1 for more details). 2.3.3. Information Seeking Behaviour and Quality Checking Intentions [26](#B26-ijerph-19-03205), [27](#B27-ijerph-19-03205), [28](#B28-ijerph-19-03205)]. 2.3.4. Awareness Factors [29](#B29-ijerph-19-03205)]. The low 's for knowledge and cues were not considered as problematic, as these scales did not measure one dimension and thus serve as an index. 2.3.5. Motivational Factors [18](#B18-ijerph-19-03205)]. Potential advantages of COVID-19 vaccinations included seven rational consequences ( = 0.89) and six emotional consequences ( = 0.86). Potential disadvantages of COVID-19 vaccination encompassed six rational outcomes ( = 0.79) and five emotional outcomes ( = 0.91). 2.4. Data Analysis 3. Results 3.1. Respondent Characteristics [Table 1](#ijerph-19-03205-t001)displays respondent characteristics. The study population was predominantly female (75.0%), with a mean age of 44.1 years, higher education (an average education level of 6.5 on a scale of 8), and mostly employed (72.1%). Most of the respondents were either not religious or Catholic. 3.2. Differences in Socio-Demographic Factors [Table 1](#ijerph-19-03205-t001)showed no differences for age and gender between the VH groups. Non-hesitant and somewhat hesitant respondents reported to have completed significantly higher levels of education than hesitant respondents. Hesitant and somewhat hesitant participants more often reported to have paid work than non-hesitant participants. A trend suggested that the percentage of hesitant and somewhat hesitant participants was highest among individuals with a religion other than Catholicism. 3.3. Differences in Information Seeking Behaviour [Table 2](#ijerph-19-03205-t002)shows that written media was used significantly less often by hesitant respondents than the other two groups as the news source for information regarding COVID-19 vaccination. We found an additional trend suggesting that hesitant individuals used social media accounts or websites of public health organisations less often than the other two groups. On the other hand, hesitant respondents used messaging services like WhatsApp more often than the other two groups. Yet, the latter two differences were not found in the contrast analysis, potentially due to a relatively low level of respondents in the two hesitant groups. Concerning the 10 items for information checking intentions, no differences were found for the three groups. All means were around 0, revealing no significant intentions to check the quality of information for these 10 sources. 3.4. Differences in Awareness [Table 3](#ijerph-19-03205-t003)shows that hesitant respondents had less knowledge than somewhat hesitant and non-hesitant respondents concerning possible infection after vaccination, side-effects, spread of the virus after vaccination, how extensively the vaccines have been tested, and the safety of the vaccines. |Mean (SD)||F||p||Post-Hoc| |Total | (n = 240) |Hesitant | (n = 58) |Somewhat | Hesitant (n = 69) |Non-Hesitant | (n = 113) |COVID vaccines can infect you with COVID (false)||0.84 (0.37)||0.71 (0.46)||0.91 (0.28)||0.87 (0.34)||5.75||0.00||H < S, N| |Pregnant vaccinated 1 (true)||0.55 (0.50)||0.62 (0.49)||0.61 (0.49)||0.47 (0.10)||13.37||0.00||H < S, N| |If enough people get vaccinated, the virus will spread less easily (true)||0.91 (0.28)||0.76 (0.43)||1.00 (0.00)||0.94 (0.24)||13.62||0.00||H < S, N| |Getting vaccinated against COVID is more dangerous than getting infected with COVID (false)||0.97 (0.18)||0.86 (0.35)||1.00 (0.00)||1.00 (0.00)||14.38||0.00||H < (0.23)||40.88||0.00||H < S, (0.24)||0.98 (0.13)||45.19||0.00||H < S, N| |How of getting COVID?||0.17 (1.07)||0.34 (1.10)||0.10 (1.03)||0.25 (1.04)||3.41||0.04||n/a| |How high do you estimate your chance of getting seriously sick of a COVID-infection?||0.70 (1.27)||0.76 (1.29)||0.39 (1.29)||0.86 (1.22)||3.06||0.05||S > N| |How high do you estimate your chance of getting permanent damage from a COVID-infection?||0.55 (1.24)||0.55 (1.23)||0.26 (1.21)||0.73 (1.24)||3.06||0.05||S > N| |How high do dying from a COVID-infection?||1.66 (1.30)||1.50 (1.22)||1.72 (1.28)||1.71 (1.26)||0.63 (1.23)||1.33||0.27||n/a| |How bad would COVID-infection?||1.80 (1.00)||1.31 (1.27)||2.04 (0.74)||1.91 (0.90)||10.43||0.00||H < S, N| |How bad damage from a COVID-infection?||2.40 (0.75)||2.21 (0.93)||2.51 (0.59)||2.42 (0.72)||2.75||0.07||n/a| |How (1.21)||2.75 (0.70)||2.67 (0.97)||3.49||0.03||H < S| COVID||0.70 (0.34)||2.37||0.10||n/a| |I read a lot of COVID recently||0.73 (0.45)||0.60 (0.49)||0.77 (0.43)||0.77 (0.42)||3.10||0.05||n/a| |I saw a lot vaccines recently||0.75 (0.43)||0.60 (0.49)||0.72 (0.45)||0.85 (0.36)||6.77||0.00||H < N| |I saw a dangers of COVID vaccines recently||0.64 (0.48)||0.69 (0.47)||0.67 (0.48)||0.60 (0.49)||0.77||0.46||n/a| 3.5. Motivational Factors [Table 4](#ijerph-19-03205-t004), hesitant respondents were significantly less convinced of the emotional and rational advantages of COVID-19 vaccination, such as protection, hindering further spread and mutations of the virus, and returning to normal life. Hesitant participants reported significantly more negative rational and emotional disadvantages for COVID-19 vaccination than other respondents on the majority of attitude items. They believed less in the effectiveness of vaccines, the duration of protection, and were more afraid than non-hesitant and somewhat hesitant respondents of severe side effects. Furthermore, they expressed more negative feelings, such as anxiety and fear, towards vaccination. Somewhat hesitant and non-hesitant respondents mostly did not differ from each other on attitude items, apart from the emotional disadvantages, of which the non-hesitant respondents were significantly more convinced than the somewhat hesitant respondents. |Mean (SD)||F||p||2||Post-Hoc| |Total | (n = 240) |Hesitant | (n = 58) |Somewhat| Hesitant (n = 69) |Non-Hesitant | (n = 113) |Attitude Pro Rational; If I get vaccinated against COVID-19 1:| |It will protect people around me from (1.84)||1.81 (1.22)||1.83 (1.58)||10.05||0.00||0.08||H < (1.40)||10.25||0.00||0.08||H < S, N| |It further spread (1.42)||0.98 (1.72)||2.12 (1.13)||2.20 (1.33)||1.58 (1.30)||10.00||0.00||0.08||H < S, N| |It of new (1.79)||0.12 (1.93)||0.90 (1.67)||1.24 (1.61)||12.27||0.00||0.09||H < S, (1.01)||16.97||0.00||0.13||H < S, (1.34)||11.59||0.00||0.09||H < S, N| (2.05)||0.03 (1.78)||0.16 (1.82)||2.80||0.06||0.02||n/a| (0.59)||23.31||0.00||0.16||H > S, (0.77)||2.35 (1.05)||23.71||0.00||0.17||H > S, N| getting severe (1.59)||0.99 (1.44)||1.64 (1.27)||30.74||0.00||0.21||H > S > N| pharmaceutical industry (2.03)||1.70 (1.19)||1.88 (1.22)||36.54||0.00||0.24||H > S, N| |I will end (1.68)||0.59 (1.67)||0.92 (1.71)||19.04||0.00||0.14||H > S, > N| |It am gambling with my (1.71)||0.29 (1.88)||1.49 (1.39)||2.19 (1.05)||61.77||0.00||0.34||H > > S > N| |It feel forced to (2.20)||1.94 (1.44)||2.48 (0.95)||48.86||0.00||0.29||H > S, N| |Social |If it < N| |If I alone||2.19 (1.06)||1.88 (1.37)||2.17 (0.95)||2.36 (0.90)||4.13||0.02||0.03||H < N| |If effects it (1.90)||1.52 (1.50)||0.22 (1.61)||0.73 (1.80)||34.77||0.00||0.23||H < S < N| |If I do not know for sure if it will give me full protection||0.40 (1.86)||0.91 (1.73)||0.61 (1.69)||0.96 (1.69)||23.85||0.00||0.17||H < S, N| |If I do not know for how long it will protect me||0.23 (1.85)||1.24 (1.48)||0.43 (1.63)||0.85 (1.74)||31.52||0.00||0.21||H < S, N| |If I contradicting information about the vaccine||0.07 (1.88)||1.31 (1.52)||0.12 (1.65)||0.74 (1.80)||28.25||0.00||0.19||H < S < N| |If I read or hear all kinds of fake news about the vaccine||0.68 (1.93)||0.52 (1.78)||0.91 (1.78)||1.15 (1.85)||16.99||0.00||0.13||H < S, N| |If people I should vaccinated||1.42 (1.55)||0.93 (1.62)||1.54 (1.46)||1.60 (1.52)||3.98||0.02||0.03||H < N| (1.62)||1.62 (1.38)||1.79 (1.42)||8.93||0.00||0.07||H < S, of the P-P plot, of and tolerance suggested no multicollinearity. Linearity and homoscedasticity assumptions were met. All VIF values stayed between 1 and 5, indicating the absence of multicollinearity. Furthermore, all tolerance values stayed above 0.4, except for rational and emotional attitudes against vaccination in the last model, which were still higher than 0.2 [31](#B31-ijerph-19-03205), [32](#B32-ijerph-19-03205), [33](#B33-ijerph-19-03205)]. Previous research has indicated that religion can be associated with VH [ [34](#B34-ijerph-19-03205), [35](#B35-ijerph-19-03205)], because some religions may be against vaccination. In our sample, the majority was either not religious or Catholic, and we found VH more associated with having a religion other than Catholicism. This effect was also reported by other studies showing more hesitancy among individuals of Protestant faith and followers of anthroposophy [ [36](#B36-ijerph-19-03205)]. However, we need to be cautious in the interpretation of this finding because of the relatively small sample size and the diversity within this group. Furthermore, previous research has indicated that people with a paid job were less likely to be hesitant [ [37](#B37-ijerph-19-03205), [38](#B38-ijerph-19-03205)], whereas our results suggest more hesitancy among those with a paid job. One explanation for this finding may be the relatively large proportion of students in this study (24.2%) who are highly educated but also less likely to have paid work. Finally, studies with a different culture and sample compositions reveal different outcomes concerning the importance of socio-demographic factors [ [39](#B39-ijerph-19-03205)], thus illustrating the need for a culture specific approach to identify core socio-demographic drivers of COVID-19 VH. [40](#B40-ijerph-19-03205)]. Hesitant respondents used WhatsApp more often than the other two groups. Reliance on social media contributing to VH has also been reported by several other studies [ [41](#B41-ijerph-19-03205), [42](#B42-ijerph-19-03205), [43](#B43-ijerph-19-03205), [44](#B44-ijerph-19-03205)]. Additional research is needed to determine the mechanisms behind the information distribution through these sources and how they influence VH, possibly by second-hand misinforming [ [12](#B12-ijerph-19-03205)]. A possible indication for this is that respondents indicated to use people in their surroundings as one of the most frequent sources for COVID-19 vaccination-related information. Previous research also indicated that health information on social media is of generally poorer quality in comparison to written media and might influence VH [ [45](#B45-ijerph-19-03205), [46](#B46-ijerph-19-03205)]. Furthermore, unregulated media (i.e., social media) are also more likely to contain misinformation and fake news, which could lead to higher VH in individuals with insufficient health literacy [ [46](#B46-ijerph-19-03205)]. No significant differences between our three study groups were found for the intentions to check the quality of the information and to combat misinformation. This suggests that our respondents did not intend to undertake preparatory actions to check for fake news or source or news credibility. A possible explanation could be that exposure to misinformation on social media regarding COVID-19 vaccination may lead to an increase in information avoidance and heuristic processing [ [47](#B47-ijerph-19-03205), [48](#B48-ijerph-19-03205)]. Since the pandemic, many people may have been exposed to misinformation that has led to a new fake news pandemic. Hence, governments need to invest in strategies aimed at developing new algorithms to identify vaccine misinformation, as well as to implement and enforce bans on the content and advertising on their websites that contain misinformation [ [49](#B49-ijerph-19-03205)]. Governments and public health organisations should actively focus on fostering informed decision-making by not only providing relevant and reliable information but also by encouraging people to check the quality of their information sources. A recent study in Germany found that higher fact-checkers more often used websites of public bodies to look up COVID-19 information and searched more often for specific COVID-19 information. Higher fact-checkers also had a higher age, more eHealth literacy, and believed less in common COVID-19 misinformation. Additionally, they had more knowledge about COVID-19, a more positive attitude towards fact-checking, and higher perceived social norms [ [50](#B50-ijerph-19-03205)]. However, as perceptions of the reliability of official sources can be very low in certain subgroups when vaccination is at stake [ [23](#B23-ijerph-19-03205)], this endeavour may not be easy. This may be especially challenging in the Netherlands, where the government opted for an early lowering of precautionary measures that resulted in steep increases of COVID-19 cases, which may have reduced the perceived reliability of governmental sources among the Dutch population. Lack of trust in authorities and pharmaceutical companies has also been reported in other studies [ [41](#B41-ijerph-19-03205), [51](#B51-ijerph-19-03205), [52](#B52-ijerph-19-03205)]. Strengthening trust, however, is crucial [ [53](#B53-ijerph-19-03205)]. [14](#B14-ijerph-19-03205), [54](#B54-ijerph-19-03205)], but not always for other vaccines [ [55](#B55-ijerph-19-03205)]. A longitudinal study, also using the I-Change Model (ICM), showed that knowledge can serve as a distal factor for influencing attitudes [ [56](#B56-ijerph-19-03205)]. This may also imply that having knowledge about relevant facts may be a first step, whereas becoming convinced of the relevance of these facts for one's behaviour is a second step. Hesitant respondents indicated a significantly lower susceptibility than somewhat hesitant respondents for getting COVID-19, while prior research suggests that previous infection was related to a lower susceptibility, resulting in hesitancy [ [57](#B57-ijerph-19-03205)]. Our hesitant group also reported a COVID-19 infection slightly more often than the other two groups, although these differences were not significant. Furthermore, hesitant respondents showed a lower perceived severity on the items about getting seriously sick of COVID-19 and dying of COVID-19 than the other respondents. Previous literature has also indicated that a lower perceived severity was linked to lower vaccine uptake [ [15](#B15-ijerph-19-03205), [58](#B58-ijerph-19-03205)]. An increase in perceived severity might therefore be a useful method to decrease VH. Lastly, hesitant respondents reported to perceive significantly less cues of news about the advantages of COVID-19 vaccination than non-hesitant respondents, which is also in line with previous research [ [29](#B29-ijerph-19-03205), [57](#B57-ijerph-19-03205)]. Providing more of these cues could be a possible strategy to combat VH in the future; however, more research may be needed to identify the most optimal source for providing these cues to avoid resistance. [16](#B16-ijerph-19-03205), [32](#B32-ijerph-19-03205), [59](#B59-ijerph-19-03205), [60](#B60-ijerph-19-03205)]. Specifically, differences between groups were found on items that mentioned the possibility of severe side-effects or doubts about the effectiveness of the vaccination and the duration of the protection. The results of the regression analyses also supported their unique association with vaccine hesitancy and showed a unique relationship between emotional attitudes and vaccination intention. Other studies also reported that online negative arguments were found to be the main driver of VH [ [61](#B61-ijerph-19-03205)] and that negative emotions influence COVID-19 VH [ [58](#B58-ijerph-19-03205)]. An important feature of the ICM and our study is the distinction between emotional and rational outcomes. Emotional consequences were also found to be important for parents in their decision-making concerning the vaccination of their children [ [23](#B23-ijerph-19-03205)]. Our findings thus suggest that emotional consequences (both advantages and disadvantages) played an important role in their attitude and intentions towards COVID-19 vaccination. Consequently, an implication for future campaigns is that the emotional feelings and related emotional consequences should be acknowledged more in (mass) media campaigns, as well as the need for highlighting the emotional advantages over the emotional disadvantages. Hence, while acknowledging potential emotional uncertainties, increasing the salience of emotional arguments for vaccination may thus be a possible strategy to decrease VH in the population. Furthermore, social norms in the environment of hesitant individuals were more negative regarding vaccination than for the less hesitant respondents. This is supported by previous research suggesting that a perceived negative social norm regarding vaccination can increase hesitancy [ [16](#B16-ijerph-19-03205), [62](#B62-ijerph-19-03205)]. Hesitant respondents also expressed a significantly lower self-efficacy towards vaccination, which is also congruent with previous publications [ [63](#B63-ijerph-19-03205), [64](#B64-ijerph-19-03205)]. This study adds detail to the specific self-efficacy-related situations that are relevant for hesitant Dutch adults. Although self-efficacy and social norms were not found to have a unique relation with VH in the regression analysis because of high correlations with attitude factors, the simple correlations with intention to vaccinate were 0.23 and 0.43, thus suggesting at least moderate importance. Future research is needed to identify their longitudinal impact. [65](#B65-ijerph-19-03205), [66](#B66-ijerph-19-03205)]. Pfizer emerged as the vaccine that people were the least hesitant about, which was also possibly caused by its positive media coverage compared to the AstraZeneca vaccine [ [67](#B67-ijerph-19-03205)]. Shortly after the data collection of this study, the Netherlands also stopped vaccinations with AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson because of concerns over possible side effects. [31](#B31-ijerph-19-03205), [32](#B32-ijerph-19-03205), [33](#B33-ijerph-19-03205)]. Research has also indicated that salient beliefs about VH may differ per specific group [ [68](#B68-ijerph-19-03205)]. Hence, future research may consider purposive sampling through a variety of recruitment channels to reach particularly hesitant groups. Third, our study may be prone to participant bias. However, although the distributions of the three groups may not represent the true distributions at that time, our study purpose was to assess differences between these groups. More females than males participated in our study. However, the distribution of males and females did not differ for the three groups differing in their intention to become vaccinated. Fourth, this research is highly time sensitive. VH rates change and are also influenced due to the emergence and spread of new information on side effects and virus mutations. The threat of new and potentially more dangerous mutations may influence perceptions on VH rapidly as well as during times of lockdowns, which may increase individuals' perceptions of risks and advantages of COVID-19 vaccination. 5. Conclusions [18](#B18-ijerph-19-03205)], this study explained 58% of the variance in VH. This finding is similar to other studies on COVID-19 VH (e.g., [ [69](#B69-ijerph-19-03205)]). Also in line with recent reviews [ [70](#B70-ijerph-19-03205)], the findings reveal important differences between hesitant and non-hesitant individuals on various predisposing, motivational, awareness, and informational factors regarding COVID-19 VH. In terms of informational factors, no differences were found between groups for undertaking preparatory actions to check information credibility. However, differences in groups were found in the use of traditional media, where non-hesitant respondents used traditional written media more often than hesitant respondents and hesitant respondents used messaging services such as WhatsApp more often. In terms of predisposing factors, a higher educational level was associated with lower VH. Vaccine hesitant respondents had lower levels of vaccine knowledge, perceived less risks of COVID-19, and reported less cues to take action. They were less convinced of the rational and emotional advantages of vaccination, reported less favourable attitudes towards vaccination from others in their environment, and indicated lower self-efficacy to cope with barriers related to vaccination. Furthermore, a key finding of this study is the importance of emotional outcomes, which stresses the need to acknowledge perceptions of the emotional disadvantages in campaigns, while also increasing perceptions of the emotional advantages of COVID-19 vaccination, such as reducing feelings of regret, increasing feelings of freedom, and reassurance. Small pilot studies may be needed to analyse which communication strategies may be most successful at reaching groups that show high levels of VH in order to better understand how to increase their trust in the health information provided by official organisations and whether other more targeted approaches may be needed to better reach these groups. Finally, there will remain groups that are hesitant to become vaccinated against COVID-19. Several options may be required to reach these groups, including more personalized approaches. One strategy could be a mandatory vaccination requirement for the general public. Albarracin and colleagues found that such a strategy did not result in a backlash against vaccination in the United States [ [71](#B71-ijerph-19-03205)]. Whether similar findings can be reported in reality and in other countries needs further analysis.
