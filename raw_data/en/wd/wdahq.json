Acupuncture is a safe and effective healing modality that has been used for over 5,000 years to enhance the body's natural ability to heal itself. People of all ages, from infants to elders can benefit from this medicine. This ancient healing art is still effective today in helping us stay peaceful and healthy amidst our modern day toxins, environment and stressors. Acupuncture activates the body's innate healing potential. Starting this process at a young age has countless benefits for your child. When should I come for acupuncture treatment? Acupuncture provides great support for anyone who is experiencing an acute or chronic ailment. You can bring your child for treatment at the first signs of a cold or illness, and when it lingers on preventing full recovery. The treatments help you heal your body naturally without depleting the body and without unwanted side effects. And you don't have to be sick to benefit from acupuncture. Receiving regular acupuncture treatments enhances your immune system so you can keep feeling well. Common pediatric conditions treated include: Asthma Allergies Anxiety & depression Behavioral issues Colic Coughs & colds Digestive issues Ear infections Eczema and other skin problems Fever Pain Tummy aches Headaches A typical session: All sessions begin with a conversation with the parent and the child to track the healing process. We celebrate any healing progress and note areas for further improvement. We also give the parents suggestions for things they can do at home to support the healing process of the child. When acupuncture needles are used, they stay in for just a few seconds, or a little bit longer as the older more experienced kids tend to prefer. We follow the comfort level of the child and use needle and/or non-needle techniques to help the body heal itself naturally without any side effects. Acupuncture for kids is different because: Pediatric Acupuncture needles are thinner than a hair and nothing like needles used for blood tests or vaccines. As the children get more comfortable with the needles, they may choose to leave them in longer. Parents are pleasantly surprised when their children find the treatments easy, painless and even fun. Children do not need to stay still to receive a treatment for long periods of time. It is perfectly fine to use acupuncture in conjunction with any other treatment modalities you choose. We understand that as parents, we try to do everything we can to help our children. It is our goal to work with you and your children to build your child's resilience. What if my child is afraid of needles? Many children are not ready to receive a needle treatment until they become more comfortable with us and trust that the needles are so thin and painless. Luckily there are several non-needle techniques, which generate the same desired results of a healthier more resilient child. Shonishin, for example, is a Japanese technique in which small metal tools are tapped or glided gently against the skin to disperse sickness and to tonify and strengthen the body. This tools do not penetrate the skin but still very powerful and beneficial in the treatment of children. There is also, other forms of stimulation that are relaxing and painless, kids find them to be a lot of fun, these are cupping, gua-sha (this is a form of myo-fascia stimulation)and also there are pediatric herbal tinctures. How often? How Often? Acupuncture is a cumulative medicine that is best used on a regular basis. Depending on the duration and severity of your child's issues, it is recommended to get treatments 1-3 times/week at first. Every few weeks we reevaluate and have the goal of monthly wellness treatments for your child. "}
