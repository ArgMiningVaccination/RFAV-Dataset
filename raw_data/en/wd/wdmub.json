We're combining our educational, clinical care, and research arms to fulfill our institutional mission: to further the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ to ma ke man whole . With our community partners , we continued to focus on the health and well -being of people in our region in FY 2021, despite the ongoing challenges posed by COVID -19. At LLUH, our focus on wholeness, health priorities, and the social determin ants of health ensures our system is meeting the needs while acknowledging the strengths of our community , as we invest in the health of tomorrow. The LLUH Community Benefit Objectives are managed by the Institute for Community Partnerships on behalf of LLUH's four licensed hospitals . This report speaks to the implementation of the second year of the Community Health Implementation Strategy 2020 -2022 (CHIS) to address the priority areas identified in t he 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). This report features the work done by LLUH & our partners in: Workforce development & education ; Access to green spaces and whole food to foster community engagement; Reduction of isolation and access to mental health resources for vulnerable populations ; Reduction of the burden of lifestyle diseases that disproportionately impact lower income populations; Access to the essentials, particularly food in 2021, as a poverty alleviation & reduction strategy. To Our Valued San Bernardino & Riverside Community Members, Loma Linda University Health rose to meet the challenges of Covid -19 and like many peopl e, families, and communities, we learned how resilient our community is in the face of an on -going pandemic. Our frontline clinical staff continued to serve, even when exhausted, from the very heart of Christ's mission to care for those in -need. Staff from across our health system helped to extend LLUH's infrastructure to support outreach, vaccination efforts, and the additional work of keeping our populations safe during the pandemic. It has been a truly challenging time and it has been one of the most ins piring and meaningful times to serve. We witnessed two encouraging sources of hope this past year: the power of vaccines and the hope that came from working alongside our community partners to reach people of color to create equity in vaccine access. The emergence of the vaccines at the start of 2021 created a collective sigh of relief when, just a few weeks after administration of the first Pfizer vaccines, and hospital infections began to drop dramatically. After a swift roll -out of vaccines at our heal th system, LLUH was able to then become a mass vaccination source for the community, serving up to 1500 community members a day in the early days of the site opening. When it became clear members of our community were lacking access to the vaccinations, we worked with our partners to create \"pop -up\" clinics in underserved communities. The critical success factor to pop -up clinics was our community partner organizations: they guided the strategy, helped provide education and outreach to dispel myths or fears about the vaccine, and often sent their community health workers to go out, door - to-door. When Governor Gavin Newsom visited LLUH to tour the mass vaccination sites, he took time to visit a pop -up clinic at the 16th Street Seventh -day Adventist Church in San Bernardino to highlight the critical role of community faith -based partner organizations in helping health systems get out the vaccine. While Covid -19 responsiveness has become a necessary addendum to our community benefit programs, the Institute for Community Partnership also continued to carry out the four licensed hospital's investments and programs ensuring our community benefit is focused on the implementation strategy priorities: from families in San Bernardino requiring access to the essentials , to children health and education needs in Coachella, to low -income seniors in the Temecula region, to students needing workforce development scholarships to bridge to college, our partners help LLUH make community benefit happen. This last year, LLUH be gan a new chapter in our institutional history of 116 years of service on behalf of the people of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. In August, LLUH opened the new adult and children's hospital towers with a successful move and transition we never thou ght we would be required to make during a pandemic. Through the peaks and valleys of the pandemic LLUH remains focused on our ongoing, frontline work with community partners to address the social determinants of health so that we may, together, journey tow ards a brighter and healthier future for the Inland Empire. Richard Hart, MD, DrPH Trevor Wright , MHA , FACHE President Chie f Executive Officer Loma Linda University Health Loma Linda University Health Hospitals ICP's Commitment to Being Relevant and Responsive Relevance and responsiveness are at the core of LLUH's community engagement. Throughout this last year, we continued our commitment to serving you on the frontlines, despite the ongoing challenges posed by COVID - 19. We at ICP and Loma Linda University Health want you to know just how much Community Matters and seek to demonstrate this through our words, informed strategies (thanks to your voice), actions and outcomes. As we reflect on another year, LLUH demonstrated our relevance and responsiveness through our pandemic response, focus on vaccine equity, CHW integration and career pathway investments. ICP's Pandemic Response : Throughout FY21 LLUH distributed over 13,000 food boxes with the partnership of CAPSBC Food Bank and the assistance of CHWs and student volunteers. Other pandemic response initiatives included continued development of our community garden to promote a safe outdoor activity for community families living in food deserts, our Medi -Cal Enrollment initiatives for increased access to healthcare and direct support for minority -led nonprofits in our community. ICP's Focus on Vaccine Equity : As the COVID -19 pandemic continues to impact our lives, LLUH committed to providing direct vaccine access through our Drayson Center mass vaccination clinic (served over 50,000 people) and additional pop -up clinics (served over 2500 people) to ensure that those most affected by the pandemic had access to vaccines. Partnerships with Inland Empire Concerned African American Churches (IECAAC), Congregations Organized for Prophetic E ngagement (COPE) and El Sol Neighborhood Educational Center allowed us to reach our most vulnerable neighbors in a human -centered way that was accessible to all. ICP's CHW Integration : Our CHW integration strategy serves two very important purposes: 1) LLUH is committed to creating jobs with livable wages and benefits; 2) Our CHWs are the bridge between health care and the community, connecting community members to health and social services, mental health resources and accompaniment to ensu re access to these resources. Our CHW team consistently goes the extra mile to ensure that each member is supported as they navigate in and out of the health care system. ICP's Pipeline Investments : LLUH is committed to supporting the future of our commun ity by investing in middle school, high school, undergraduate and graduate minority students who will be our future healthcare providers. Our pipeline program is an access, equity and inclusion strategy focused on serving at-promise and under -estimated youth in workforce development and poverty reduction. It is through these relevant and responsive actions that we continue to demonstrate to you that we are listening, you matter, and we are stronger together. Juan Carlos Belliard, PhD, MPH Assistant Vice President LLUH - Institute for Community Partnerships LLUH's Covid -19 Response in FY 2 1 As we entered 2021, the second year of the Covid -19 Pandemic, our tired but resilient healthcare workers and community felt a gleam of hope with the approval of the coronavirus vaccine. As news of the vaccine became reality, LLUH leapt into action and bro ught our hospital, university, and community together to launch a mass vaccination clinic site at Loma Linda University's Drayson Center . LLUH drew on the strength of its community members, students, and staff to operate the clinic in a majority -volunteer capacity, serving up to 2,000 San Bernardino County residents per day. Our community members, connected through fostered community partnerships, fearlessly stepped into both clinical and non -clinical volunteer roles to make the vaccination process as seam less as possible in uncertain circumstances. Many healthcare workers were putting in time at the hospital and coming to aid at the clinic on their days off and after a full shift . Retired healthcare workers stepped back into clinical roles to provide vac cinations. Volunteers signed up for long shifts and countless hours to provide vaccine education, wayfinding, emotional support, and customer service to vaccine clinic guests. Students from Loma Linda University and surrounding colleges stepped in to aid in many different capacities. In all, LLUH engaged over 7,000 volunteers and over 47,000 doses were administered from January to May of 2021 . This was a truly herculean effort that was echoed at mass vaccination sites across the nation. In addition, LLUH and our Community Partners remained committed to our community's well -being. This included the ongoing support of the community garden (Jardin de la Salud) in the heart of San Bernardino built during the previous pandemic year. This symbo l of resiliency brought real food relief and a safe space for physical activity to the community . We also conducted food box deliveries, provided online tutoring and educational support for students, and organized additional pop -up equity vaccine clinics t o provide critical services to over 80,000 people in FY21 . This report is the story of 2021 and LLUH's relevance and responsiveness in both our inpatient, outpatient, and community settings .

LLUH Community Benefit Model A Centralized Community Benefit Model Six Hospitals. One Community Benefit Implementation Mission. LLUH has a unique, best -practice model in the implementation of community benefit in order to achieve collective impact with their investment and program strategy: Since 20 12, all licensed hospitals within the LLUH system have centralized their community benefit investments thro ugh the Institute for Community Partnerships to more strategically align and implement community health investments . Since the beginning, LLUH has reported programmatically at the health system level to maximize outcomes . The community benefit numbers are reported financially and independently on each licensed hospital's 990 Schedule H based on their indi vidual hospital financials with attentive management to both the collective and individual program s, activities, and outcomes reported in the a nnual system community benefit report , in compliance with the ACA (2010) and California's AB 204 (2019). The centralized model allows the hospitals to accomplish more impact in the community from the Community Health Implementation Strategy (CHIS) and in more effectively working with partner organizations with similar goals. LLUH Community Benefit: Centralized, Coordinated, Collect Impact by Design , Outcomes -Driven LLUH's Hospitals: Collective Impact Institute for Community Partnerships The Institute for Community Partnershi ps is committed to supporting implementation of LLUH's hospital community benefit investments and fulfillment of the priority focus areas , in close collaboration with the community, to community -based research, and to service -learning at Loma Linda University Health (LLUH). The Institute plays a centralizing, coordinating, and implementation function for the four licensed hospitals for LLUH's community benefit investment dollars. Our institute is committed to strategically working with our community partners to better understand and address the needs of the community through activities such as research, teaching, and academic serv ice learning. Community participation is at the core of our efforts, with str uctured learning opportunities for underrepresented minority students, community engaged research, training programs and workforce integration for community health workers and promotores . The Institute for Community Partnerships: Seeks to work \"with\" the community rather than \"in\" the community. Strives to better understand and address the needs of the community, while recognizing and capitalizing on its assets. Seeks to integrate services from research to teaching through community -based participation and academic service learning. Provides a supporting and coordinating role across the various schools and the Medical Center. Our Community Benefit Objectives inclu de: Improving access to health services. Enhancing the role of public health in health care services. Serving those who live in poverty and other vulnerable populations. Promoting and enhancing community building activities. Committing to community health improvement throughout the organization. Many Strengths, One Mission Mission Vision Values To ensure Loma Linda University Health is relevant and responsive to our community. To be the primary portal for community engagement between Loma Linda University Health and our local community. Collaboration, Respect, Equity, Compassion, Excellence Listen. Engage. Respect. About the Community We Serve Loma Linda University Health's primary service area can be defined, broadly, as California's San Bernardino, Riverside, and Ontario metropolitan areas. San Bernardino and Riverside counties make up the geographic area historically named \"the Inland Empire\" due to the region's rich diversity of native peoples and a gricultural history. The region totals 27,000 square miles and is situated approximately 60 miles east from the Los Angeles metropolitan area and the Pacific Ocean . The Inland Empire is home to a quickly growing population over 4. 6 million people and is th e 3rd most populous metropolitan area in the State of California and the 13th most populous metropolitan area in the United States. The two counties are home to some of the most diverse people s in California, with Latinos representing the majority of the population. Measure of America 's Spotlight on the Inland Empire Using the American Human Development Index (HDI)1 The American Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite measure of well -being and access to opportunity made up of health, education, and earnings indicators. The index is expressed on a scale of 0 to 10. Measure of America's HDI calculations provide a snapshot of community well -being, reveal inequalities between groups, allow for tracking change over time, and provide a tool for holding elected officials accountable. Broken down by race and ethnicity, by gender, and by census tract, the index shows how communities across the Inland Empire are faring relative to one another and to the state and country as a w hole.2 1 https://measureofamerica.org/california2021 -22/ 2 https://ssrc -static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/SpotlightontheInlandEmpire.pdf - Page 5 The HDI score for the Inland Empire is 5.10 out of 10, compared to 5.85 for the state as a whole. This score places the Inland Empire right in the center of the ranked list of California metro areas \u2014fifteen metro areas have a higher score, and sixteen have a lower score. Over the last ten years, the Inland Empire's score has improved more than the state score; a decade ago, the Inland Empire scored, 4.58 and California scored 5.46. The HDI score of the Inland Empire increased a t a slightly higher rate than that of California: 11.4 percent versus 7.1 percent. Today, residents of the Inland Empire live over two years longer, are more likely to hold high school diplomas and bachelor's degrees, and earn about $7,000 more than Inland Empire residents in 2009.3 San Bernardino and Riverside County Health Rankings The County Health Rankings (at countyhealthrankings.org ) bring to light elements that impact the health of residents and average lifespans by geographic region. The rankings are unique in their ability to measure the current overall health of nearly every county in all 50 states. They also look at a variety of measures that affect the future health o f communities, such as high school graduation rates, access to healthy foods, rates of smoking, obesity and teen births. LLUH's goal is to bring people together to look at the many factors that influence health and opportunities to reduce health gaps. For programs and interventions to have a lasting impact, they must focus on strategies that improve health from a population standpoint. For LLUH, we are strategically positioned in two counties that together, face significant economic challenges. San Bernardi no ranks 4 0th out of 58 counties in California in terms of health factors while Riverside ranks 32nd. Despite the challenge, LLUH believes in our community 's resilie nce and that with our community partners, we can address poverty and foster health and well ness through a workforce development strategy . 3 https://ssrc -static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/SpotlightontheInlandEmpire.pdf - Page 7 COVID -19 Impact With a total of 752,663 confirmed cases as of the time of this report, and over 11,000 deaths due to COVID -19 across San Bernardino and Riverside counties, the pandemic has disproportionally impacted low-income communities and communities of color in the region, with some of the biggest challenges being food insecurity, unemployment, housin g burden, and social isolation. As a result of the pandemic, the number of food insecure households has risen considerably, with local food banks more than doubling the amount of their food distributions. The h ousing crisis has become another prevalent is sue as median home prices rose to $390,000 in San Bernardino County and $495,500 in Riverside County during FY21, a 20 and 19 percent increase respectively over a 12 mo nth period. Rental prices have also climbed at a higher rate than anywhere else in the c ountry . Average rent in the Inland Empire has increased 8.5% year -over -year to roughly $1,662 per month, or a monthly increase of $130 compared to the same period last year.4 This has magnified our region's affordability and caused additional burden to th e majority of households in our counties. Additionally, social isolation, which had already been identified as a great need of our community before the spread of COVID -19, has become even more of a challenge due to physical distancing measures and continu ed technological divide .

In addition to the 4.6 million residents of these two counties, it is estimated due to seasonal agricultural work that there are an estimated 259,000 immigrants who are undocumented in our two counties, with LLUH as the main regional safety -net provider for all people. In 20 20, LLUH hospitals treated 48,343 people in our hospitals and 1.8 million people in the outpatient system with 135,603 of those outpatient visits to our Emergency Departments as a Level 1 Trauma center. 4 https://therealdeal.com/la/2021/05/12/inland -empire -rent-hikes -highest -in-nation/ 1 in 3 People who visit LLUH's hospitals are insured by Medi -Cal.

LLUH Community Benefit Strategy Community Benefit is reported according to four major categories and broken into different types of activities that are reported in each hospital' s 990, Schedule H. For more information on each category, see the appendix. Community Health Benefit investment dollars are reported programmatically, by priority area and outcomes, in fulfillment of LLUH's current imple mentation strategy. All dollars are carefully accounted for and reported according to the appropriate fiscal year in hospital 990 Schedule H , though programs and outcomes reporting may span multiple years. The Community Health Benefit Strategy This is a high -level summary of the 2019 CHNA priorities that the 2020 -2022 implementation strategy is based on and what that guides LLUH's community investments and program implementations. To read the full & CHIS reports, https://lluh.org/about -us/communit y-benefit/reports -and-resources Targeting the Social Determinants of Health The focus areas guide our Social Determinant s of Health Targets for program design and implementations.

Community Benefit Implementation FY 2 1 Community Partner El Sol Neighborhood Educational Center Promotores at a COVID -19 pop -up equity street clinic Spring of 2021 Special Implementation: Covid -19 Respons e So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. - Baha'U'Llah Food Security Response - Food Box Delivery Program With the continuation of the pandemic and ongoing needs of the community in 2021, LLUH along with the support of our partners , was able to maintain our implementation plan for community benefit o n behalf of the hospitals. In addition to maintain ing our routine operations, LLUH ICP and community partners adopted additi onal implementation objectives to strengthen our relevance and resp onsiveness to our community this year. The Community Safety -net Response to Covid -19 Expanded partnerships and outreach with Feeding America food banks in our two -county region: LLUH -ICP provided coordinated distribution and volunteer labor in partne rship with Community Action Partnership of San Bernardino (CAPSBC) to deliver food boxes and community investment dollars to FIND Food Bank in the Coachella Valley to reach lower -incom e, isolated, and disenfranchised or disconnected communities in order to increase food security in t he region. Prior to the pandemic, feeding America estimated 1 -in-10 people in San Bernardino County were food insecure. That estimate is now 1-in-6 people in San Bernardino County will be food insecure by the end of 2020.5 CAPSBC served over 1 .5 million individuals in calendar year 20 20 that include s the distribution of 1 6.3 million pounds of food . The total food distribution in 2020 for CAPSBC far exceed ed previous years as they have been coordinating the distribution of 1,000 food boxes weekly in the community, with LLUH -ICP coordinating nearly 300 of those boxes per week for delivery to local families. Since the start of the pandemic, FIND Food Bank went from serving 90,000 people a month to 190,000 people a month : this is more double in the demand for food. FIND Food Bank estimates now that 1 in 5 people in the Coachella desert region of Riverside County are now food insecure .6 Additionally, Loma Linda University Health became involved in setting up a mass vaccination site for the public, with staff from across the institution serving at the clinic alon gside 6o community volunteers a day, when the site first opened, to administer the first injections to our community. While this was not a community benefit programming, it was an example of LLUH pivoting our operations in order to support the priority nee ds of the community in collaboration with local Department of Public Health, County, and government partners to combat the spread of Covid -19. 5 \"Community Organizations to provide food to over 1,000 families,\" Highland Community News. July 30, 2020. 6 FIND Food Bank's website: https://www.findfoodbank.org/finds -covid -response/ Vaccination Programs LLUH Mass Vaccination Clinic In January 2021, LLUH committed to service in action by organizing one of the largest community vaccination sites in the Inland Empire. Taking place at the Drayson Center, LLUH was at the center of a truly collaborative effort. The mass vaccination center operated five days per week, 10 -12 hours per day from late January through the end of May 2021. More than 43,000 vaccine doses were administered to residents of San Bernardino County and the surrounding community. Team members from across the organization provided essential administration, operations, safety, planning and logistics functions. This unique initiative provided leadership, students, staff and community volunteers the opportunity to serve at a time when all of us were eager to be a part of the s olution. The Institute for Community Partnerships played a critical role in leading the coordination of up to 100 volunteers per day, while applying an equity lens to the community clinic ensuring it was accessible and welcoming to all.7 LLUH was determined to do what it could to help keep our community safe and to turn the tide of this pandemic. Vaccine Equity through Pop -Up Vaccine Clinics LLUH recognized that ensuring community members disproportionately impacted by COVID -19 have access to life -saving vaccines required us to expand vaccine efforts beyond the mass vaccination center. Structural racism and existing disparities in wealth, education, job access, health care access, working conditions, transportation and neighborhood conditions made it challenging for local Black and Latino comm unity members to participate in vaccination efforts. LLUH's commitment to COVID -19 vaccine equity meant we needed to meet our community members where they live and work. Beginning in early February of 2021, LLUH teamed up with trusted organizational partners IECAAC, COPE, and El Sol, to offer COVID -19 vaccines in Black and Brown communities that have been hardest hit by the pandemic. Together, these partners have conducted more than 30 pop -up vaccine clinics, providing more than 2,700 v accinations in communities across San Bernardino County. 7 For purposes of Community Benefit reporting, ICP has only reported its cost associated with staff time operations in its hospital community benefit dollars. \"After feeling so helpless for close to a year watching from the sidelines as COVID concerns co nsumed our daily lives, I enjoyed helping and being a part of the solution.\" -Vaccine Clinic Volunteer How the LLUH Covid -19 Response is supported by hospital's Community Benefit dollars The hospitals ' investment in the operational costs of ICP provided the staff time to support LLUH's overall community and public health responsiveness in the community during Covid -19 to accomplish: o Food Distribution with the help of key community partners o LLUH system -employed Community Health Workers made phone calls to families , del ivered hundreds of food boxes to community members , collected and delivered breastmilk for NICU mothers that were C OVID positive, and were key support to mobile vaccination clinics o Investments in \"Jardin de la Salud\", a local community garden that support s outdoor education and access to healthy food options. o Capacity Building investments with partner organizations during a difficult time for local community nonprofits. In Fiscal Year 2021, ICP continued to support Covid -19 rapid responsiveness by deploying CHWs, LLU students and ICP staff to deliver food boxes to families in the region with high SDOH risk factors. This focus on improved access to healthy food options became vital during a time when families and community members n eeded it most. ICP also provided technical assistance to support our nonprofit partners during the challenges brought forth by COVID -19. This included a robust Self -Assessment tool, financial review and recommendations, and the development of a new staff position. This allowed our nonprofit partners to not only navigate through the challenges brought forth by the pandemic , but continue to grow and sustain their organizations for long - term community support. In summary, LLUH hospitals provided, through th eir existing investments in the Institute, the staffing to work as part of the emergency responsiveness in the community allowing our health system response to be relevant, responsive, coordinated, and part of the network of community -based organizations r eaching out to the community. Workforce Development & Pipeline to Higher Education LLUH's primary focus area s for the 2020 -2022 CHIS Cycle are initiatives related to workforce development and education to impact, over the long -term, the effect of poverty in our region. Jobs and education are a primary in vestment area of the hospitals in order to work with partners who are providing access to traditionally under -represented, under -served, and often under -estimated youth and young adults who are low -income and/or people of color. In FY 2 1, LLUH ICP worked with three partners to expand the outreach to middle & high -school youth to bridge them to workforce education, entry, and bridge scholarship. Partners continued to meet virtua lly to keep students focused on thinking about their future . Community -Academic Partners in Service (CAPS) The pipeline programs operated by the Institute for Community Partnerships ' are coordinated by the Community -Academic Partners in Service (CAPS) program and intended to provide disadvantaged youth exposure and a ccess to exercise, healthy lifestyle education, and career options in health care in order to increase access to education, a community benefit investment of LLUH hospitals. The primary goal of the Pipeline program over the 2020 -2022 funding cycle is to bring more community organizations doing similar work together to strengthen the regional response and res ources available to our youth. Investing in the Youth of San Bernardino and Riverside is the long - term strategy to move the needle on poverty in our region. The pipeline program activities are funded by hospital community benefit: o My Campus - quarterly outreach with health professionals to introduce students to health professions. o Discovery Program - A three -week summer intensive where students learn about health careers, o Robotic Surgery Simulation Event o Pipeline Alumni Association Other wellness and health interventions implemented through CAPS include: o Tutoring and school -based support services (online in FY 2 1) o Family resource center , La Escuelita at a local school (and online) o Goal 4 Health , a soccer league for underserved youth to increase access to safe green spaces, recreation, and safe play (suspe nded in FY 2 1 due to Covid -19). What do we mean by Pipeline Programs? LLUH has been building a pipeline to higher education to connect local minority and under -served youth to health careers as an access, equity, and inclusion strategy. This is in alignment with mission of service and participation in the local community through the Institute for Community Partnership's CAPS program and hospital community benefit investment strategy and implementation with community an d other regional partners. Oversight of Jardin de la Salud & Produce Rx programs The CAPS program as part of ICP also oversees the implementation of \"Jardin de la Salud \", a community -based garden located at the previous La Escuelita site next to SAC Norton Clinic and the Helping Hands pantry. This garden functions to serve families in our community, and engages students of LLU and Discovery 2021 participants from local high schools into c ommunity service . Thanks to the CAPS and Huerta del Valle collaboration in Winter Quarter of 2020 , this project now in FY21 has 30 active family plots and is in Phase 2. Additionally, the CAPS team helped provide 64 CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) produce boxes to community members and conducted various workshops to promote healthy living. T his included workshops on mental health, gardening, diabetes prevention and many others. More on the Jardin de la Salud is covered in the following section s of this report , as well as the FY 21 growth of the Produce Rx program with SAC Healt h. For more information, visit: https://caps.llu.edu/ Because of the Jardin de la Salud project , over 30 families are now growing organic produce in the heart of San Bernardino City, with room to grow to a total of 52 family plots! Making Hope Happen Foundation San Bernardino City Unified School District LLUH has made a sustained investment in Making Hope Happen, a bridge scholarship program that provides San Bernardino students a bridge scholarship of $3,000 . This scholarship is distributed to 20 students, as well as a stipend for a mentor. The graduating seniors who will become freshmen are paired with a past recipient . O lder undergraduate student s who understand the unique challenges many first and second -generation college students face , support them to as they bridge to higher education. Pipeline Graduate Access Scholarships In FY 2 1, LLUH -ICP continued to provide access scholarships with two of the schools in the LLU system to open access to higher education for under -estima ted youth and students of color who have traditionally lacked access to graduate education in the health professions, a lifelong game -changer for local residents who come from low -income earning families in the region. The requirements of the scholarships wer e the schools had to match the community benefit investment in order amplify the impact on the greatest number of students who met the Community Benefit guidelines. Over the current CHIS cycle, ICP will enga ge more partners in working to open access schola rships as part of the long -term commitment to growing the healthcare workforce of tomorrow with local students who understand the community and show an interest in continuing to work in this region . This investment highlights the effort to uplift families and make generational changes that reduce the impact of poverty in our region. A Letter of Gratitude from a FY2 1 Scholarship Recipient: \"I was honored to receive the Community Benefit scholarship. This scholarship helped relieve the financial burden that comes with pursuing higher education and has allowed me to spend more time volunteering and working in the community. I am immensely grateful to Community Benefit for supporting local students to serve t he region. As a future public health professional, I hope to serve the community that raised me by addressing social determinants of health and advocating for equitable healthcare access. It is a great pleasure to be able to work with the community that in spired and supported me in reaching my academic goals .\" Investing in Health Professional Education Workforce Development at San Manuel Gateway College In 2016, thanks to a seed investment made by the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, the LLUH system was able to build and establish a technical and vocational training college , the San Manuel Gateway College (SMGC) , in the heart of San Bernardino. The college is co-located with the SAC Health System to provide a community -setting for the training of future healthcare workers. As Loma Linda University (LLU) is a graduate medical education campus with over eight graduate schools, the health system recently committed a year -over -year investment to support SMGC operations and extend access to community members seeking access to vocational and technical training in order to strengthen the pipeline to education in the region. SMGC students also rotate through LLUH's many clinical settings for training during their programs. In FY 2 1, Loma Linda University Medical Center invested $1.5 million in SMGC to support health professional education operational costs and training as an access strategy to address workforce develo pment and education needs of local youth. The SMGC Student Population proudly represents: Students of Color First Generation students or \"first few in their family \" to attend post -secondary education Residents of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties Over 50% receive financial aid or scholarships to attend SMGC. Students are p rovided support from the SMGC staff and faculty given the challenges and life experiences many of the SMGC students face regarding risk factors related to the social determinants of health. Every year, the SMGC graduates are i ncluded in the annual graduation ceremonies and celebr ations at Loma Lin da University to honor th eir success and accomplishment and association with a health care system and institution of higher education. For more about SMGC visit the website at : http s://sanmanuelgatewaycollege.llu.edu/ The Goal of SMGC SMGC provides local youth and adults from San Bernardino and the surrounding areas access to professional training and certification as a workforce development strategy. In 202 1, SMGC provided the following technical training programs and certifications: o Certified Nursing Assistant o Medical Assistant o Promotores Academy (Community Health Worker Basic Certification ; and Clinic -based Communit y Health Workers) o Pharmacy Tech o Surgical Tech SMGC is developing the health care workforce of tomorrow while providing the bridge to help our community's youth and ad ults find a path to higher education to set them on a life -long path of career development and economic advancement. How the LLUH hospital's Community Benefit dollars support Workforce Development & Education In FY 2 1, ICP continues to engage more partners in the regional pipeline to support , align and engage in collective impact with regional partners in an effort to align to the local School District and County's similar efforts in workforce development and education . While CAPS also includes oversight of the service learning and coordination of Loma Linda University student volunteers, only the cost of operations and CAPS programs that are funded by the hospitals are reported as community benefit . In Fiscal Year 20 21, the hospit als invested the following in workforce development and education efforts in the community: $70,000 in access schola rships to high school students; $30,000 to pipeline programs, including scholarships to high school students bridging to undergraduate schoo l; $30,000 to support workplace internships in Public Health; $20,000 access scholarship dollars in Nursing; and $10,000 access scholarships dollars in Public Health . The LLUH partners awarded scholarships to over 50 students bridging to education. In Fiscal Year 2021, ICP also committed to investing in workforce development and education with partners in the Murrieta/Temecula region. This included investments of $43,000 for an additional 37 scholarships. The hospital s report dollars invested in Health Professions Education for the training of medical professionals above and beyond our federal or state subsidies and grants, or indirect or direct medical education dollar s received. LLUH provides operational support to San Manue l Gateway College as part of the commitment to susta in the operations of this critical workforce access strategy. Community Health Worker (CHW) Workforce Integration LLUH -ICP is stewarding workforce development for community hea lth workers as a major intiative in the 2020 - 2022 CHIS cycle in order to pilot integration in school districts, hospital systems, and with non -profit partners where CHW's have traditionally not been hired in our region. LLUH -ICP provides the management and oversight of programs as part of our operations and supports FTE dollars to pilot CHW work in order to prove the return on investment for sector partners to sustain the workforce over time. To view this video visit : https://icp.llu.edu/our -work/chw -integration \"Community Health Worker - She saw me as human .\" CHW Health System Integration In FY 2019 LLUH initiated a pilot with three CHWs who integrated into high -risk areas where vulnerable populations access our health system but face un due health burdens in trying to address their health and wellness post -encounter in either inpatient or outpatient settings. This includes linkages to LLUH's priority on disease related to poverty through a focus on at-risk infants and mothers and Black in fant health in the NICU and at -risk adults with diabetes in the outpatient Diabetes Treatment Center. Due to the initial success of the pilot program in 2019, LLUH is formally creating a CHW Integration and Intervention Program through the Institute for Co mmunity Partnerships based on the following parameters: To date, LLUH hospitals invested in four CHW positions and a manager to run the program. The ICP management/operations positions support the El Sol CHEW s and school district contracts in addition to the establishment of the CHW program at LLUH. The LLUH CHWs will be entirely focused on the target population, those from underserved communities who lack access to services and face poverty, based on the community benefit investment in this community inte rvention. It is the goal of this program to use the hospital's investment to intervene and lighten the burden of the social determinants of health through community peers who are expertly trained in recognizing and navigating the social determinants of hea lth. While the CHWs are employed by LLUH and meet people who represent vulnerable populations in our region, they are assigned to work in the community with patients and their families who represent the target population, as defined by community benefit pa rameters. To ensure this is upheld, CHWS working within the LLUH program will abide by the following metrics: A 51% minimum of time in the community with a stretch goal of 60% time spent in the community will serve as the macro indicator for the program. Secondary outcomes related to special populations, as well as demographic information, will be captured to study the impact of CHWs working with underserved or marginalized populations. Outcomes will be presented in community benefit reporting and in resea rch published and presented in professional journals and conferences by ICP to help increase the access and technical assistance available to health systems who wish to replicate the CHW integration model . LLUH CHWs will focus on home visits and community CHWs at LLUH spend hours with patients who face multiple social determinant burdens as our team motto is: \"Time is the Medicine\" LLUH System CHWs spend a minimum of 51% of their time out in the community with a target intervention of 60% or 3 days a week . outreach classes/peer support groups for vulnerable populations with the following programmatic goals: Time is the Medicine - Unlike health care providers and clinical staff, the CHWs are able to provide time -intensive interventions outside the four walls of our clinical settings. This is accomplished through a trusted relationship as CHWs are able to quickly establish themselves as community peers and engage with community members once they are home. CHWs work with community members and their family membe rs to navigate complex social and health systems to address, manage, and maintain their help once these community members are no longer \"patients\" in our facility, but integrating back to the home to get the follow -up care they need. Intervention & Accom paniment - CHWs provide supportive coaching and mentoring to help those they work with navigate complex social services and benefits like (DMV, Social Security, Veterans Affairs, etc.). CHWs are also able to accompany community members to follow -up medical appointments . CHWs are able to support individuals in accessing essential resources like food banks, housing and rental assistance, behavioral health, substance use support and other critical resources in the community . Special Population s Focus - The LLUH CHWs will be stationed in critical access areas of the health system in order to become connected to community members who are experiencing the highest levels of need. The following are special populations the CHW program will address: At-risk infants and mothers Adults with diabetes Children and youth with diabetes Homeless individuals in our Emergency Department Individuals experiencing escalation of symptoms related to Sickle Cell Diseases Individuals in need of mental health or behavioral health resour ces; Victims of violent crime who receive trauma -related surgical interventions; High utilizers of the LLUH system who experience undue social determinant burden and require extensive, supportive accompaniment and linkage to health and social services upon discharge from LLUH. Finally, special to this program is the triple investment where CHW workforce develop ment helps the CHW, the patients they assist, and the system . Creating CHWs jobs is an economic development strategy since CHW s often need the same access to employment as those they are tirelessly serving. Historically, CHWs have not been part of the formal workforce with workplace benefits. Employment reduces the reliance on grant -based or project \u2014based employment for CHWs, a source of income insecurity and provides the stability of full -time benefitted employment . In addition t o the programmatic outreach and intervention provided by the CHWs, the creation of the jobs for community members who are trained in this work is also a fulfillment of the community benefit workforce development strategy as priority hiring is reserved for people with lived experience in navigating the social determinants of health . In FY 2 1, LLUH's CHWs were deployed to: Provide outreach and enrollment to the Diabetes Treatment Center and engage Hispanic and Latino community members experiencing metabolic syndrome and pre -diabetes into Diabetes Prevention Program (based on the CDC programs) free of cost , year -long classes and mentoring in improving health outcomes. Provide outreach an d CHW intervention ( accompaniment , home and phone follow -up calls and visits, and ongoing support) to mother s with medically fragile infants who are discharged from the NICU and face multiple social determinant s of health risks upon returning to community. Outreach and engagement with the unsheltered and victims of traumatic injury in the Emergency Room to support with linkages to services and alternative options for community members (Violence Intervention Program) . Outreach and engagement with patients living with Sickle Cell Disease in the emergen cy room to provide peer support . Food security screening calls and delivery of food boxes to known community members with SDOH risk factors. Resource screening calls in partnership with the PossAbilities program to members of the Sickle Cell and Angeles Especial es (Mother's with special needs children) support groups. The CHW Integration Model at LLUH developed by ICP staff is undergoing testing through implementation and research for ongoing outcomes reporting and to support future capacity building of partners integrating CHWs into their programs: Outcomes - CHW Integration FY 2 1 School Districts - Community Health Education Workers ICP contracts and provides technical assistance to School Districts to create CHEW jobs in partnership with El Sol Neighborhood Educational Center : LLUH through ICP is building community health education worker teams (CHEWs) in local school districts in order to extend outreach to at -risk pop ulations of students, or youth who are at -promise, based on the district 's greatest needs . The CHEWs are trained to work in the education system and through relationship building and home visits, extend outreach, social supports, linkages and accompaniment s to families, resource support, and informal peer counseling to help students who are chronically absent, face undue health challenges, or are experiencing mental or behavioral health crisis have additional, intensive supportive resources. ICP currently contracts with two school districts (San Bernardino City Unified School District and Chaffey Joint Union High School District) and employs six CHEWS working in the community, a manager of integration to oversee the project, and is conducting interventions with families w ith children who are chronically absent , need COVID -19 response (education, access to technology/vaccines/etc.), are food insecure and address the barriers associated with the social determinants of health. ICP's contracts with the local sch ool districts provide workforce development dollars for CHW integration into school districts with ICP contributing the management time and infrastructure to support the integration and outcomes. Future school sites are intended in the coming years to grow the program and root community health and education workers into the fabric of the school district's workforce to provide sustained and critical outreach to families of school -age youth who suffer undue burdens from multiple social determinant s of health risk factors. CHEW s have intervened in the 20 20-202 1 school year specifically to address: Vaccine compliance (increase access to school) Behavioral health risk assessment and risk -factor reduction for suicide among school -age children & youth Chronic absenteeism Food & housing insecurity due to Covid -19 Outcomes - CHEW Team in FY 2 1 CHW Integration Project - FIND Food Bank ICP invested (dollars reported in FY 19 numbers) in non -profit, community -based organizational partners who want to expand outreach to their populations through the addition of community health workers through either seed funding for community health worker po sitions or, through technical assistance with grant activities to help increase partner potential to acquire dollars to hire community health workers. ICP invested in a community health worker integration program with a non -profit partner in the Coachella Valley where FIND Food Bank added a CHW to their outreach team. The CHW is able to support families in both Calf resh & SNAP benefits with potential reimbursement for these services as part of the longer sustainability plan as the CHW supports the FIND team focusing on intensive outreach visits to at -risk families . FIND Food Bank is a critical food security partner in the Coachella Valley. Because of LLUH's inv estment in a CHW to join , FIND was able to deploy the LLUH sponsored CHW to support emergecy f ood relief. FIND Food Bank helped LLUH reach an additional 1,271 people with the work of 1 CHW. How the LLUH hospital's Community Benefit dollars support CHW Workforce Integration All four licensed hospitals invest in ICP operations to carry out this level of partnership, responsiveness, and stewardship of the integration of CHWs into the health system. The CHWs in the health system are hired by the Institute for Community Partner ships and integration is managed to guarantee that 51% or more of the CHW labor is time spent outside the health system following patients as they re -integrate into community and follow their recommended health and social plans of care. Additionally, throu gh food security efforts in FY 2 1 and other public service programs , LLUH CHWs help community members regardless of their relationship to LLUH. In the case of ICP contracts, like with school districts, only operational expenses above and beyond contractu al revenue for FTEs are reported as community benefit. Investments in partners hiring CHWs are made in programmatic agreements to ensure outcomes reporting in alignment with community outreach and impact outcomes. In fiscal year 2 1, with the on going pandemic, CHWs continued to provide intensive support services as their special populations, program operations also resumed supporitng discharged patients, providing navigational support community members to access resources, making referrals for p eople with increasing social determinant needs, and supporting food security and delivery efforts. LLUH -ICP is investing in non -profit partners who hire CHWs and support workforce development. Green Space: Jardin de la Salud 52 Community Gardner Plots. 35 rows for production to support local food markets. In 2020, Huerta del Valle, LLUH -ICP, and S AC Health partnered to install a community garden at the S AC Norton Clinic on 3rd Street in downtown San Bernardino. Huerta del Vall e is a non -profit with a pioneering vision to place \"one community garden per mile of our region.\" More than a garden, Huerta is an outdoor community center: families rent plots for affordable rates, there are community education and training efforts to he lp people learn to grow food and buy local, and there is a larger scale agricultural production and CSA (community supported agriculture) program to get organic, fresh food out to the community. Huerta has done what many community gardens fail to do, they have created a vibrant place for community . Jardin de la Salud (the garden of health ) is an incredible equity effort to bring organic, nutritious food to a food desert area of San Bernardino where the neighborhoods lack access to affordable, healthy produce. A Garden Grows During Covid -19 \"Hope for the future is at the heart of all gardening\" -Unknown How the LLUH hospital's Community Benefit dollars supported Jardin de la Salud Loma Linda University Medical Center and Loma Linda University Children's hospitals have made historic year -over -year investments in SAC Health to support the transition to FQHC status with bridge funding to ensure operational sustainability. Additionally, ICP has allocated staff time to support the implementation, installation, and community engagement in the garden. Beginning in 2020, LLUH was able to invest community benefit dollars to support community members to plan and create a garden. Additiona lly dollars for fencing , lighting and daily maintenance were contributed by the hospitals through community health investment dollars and the health system provided additional infrastructure support through campus engineering (not reported as hospital comm unity benefit dollars), but part of LLUH's overall investment in the success of this community green space. More than a Garden Jardin de la Salud is not just a healthy food access strategy: it is an outdoor community center. The garden is milestone in fulfillment of the 2019 CHNA when the community asked for safe green spaces along with jobs, food, and housing as top priorities. 30 families are now coming weekly to the garden to tend their food plots and over 130 volunteers have safely worked to support this community effort during Covid -19. Medi -Cal Enrollment Grant Loma Linda University Health - Institute for Community Partnerships was awarded $610,149 in grant funding8 from the San Bernardino County Transitional Assistance Department during 2021 to help uninsured San Bernardino County residents enroll in Medi -Cal h ealth insurance. The target populations for this program are diverse, including people with substance use disorders, mental or physical disabilities, unhoused, seniors, young people of color, immigrants and families of mixed immigration status, those with limited English proficiency, low -wage workers and their families or dependents, and uninsured children. The goal of this program is to connect eligible community members to quality, affordable health coverage from Medi -Cal. The \"Health for All\" p artner organizations collaborating on this program include El Sol Neighborhood Educational Center , Inland SoCal United Way , and Congregations Organized for Prophetic Engagement (COPE). LLU ICP provides project oversight, strategy development, and technical assistance. Inland SoCal United Way serves as the project's call center for phone -based Medi - Cal enrollment, screens all 211 callers for health insurance status, refers eligible clients to the call center's health navigators for application assistance, and assists clients in submitting Medi -Cal and CalFresh applications by phone . El Sol and COPE employ various strategies to educate community members about Medi -Cal and assist them in applying, providing on -site application assistance and outreach at pop - up COVID -19 Vaccine Clinics, health fairs, food banks , and other community events. The collaborative model ensure we reach diverse populations where they live and work. 8 For purposes of Community Benefit reporting, ICP has only reported its cost above the grant in its hospital community benefit dollars. Access to Care & Services for Underrepresented Populations Making people whole . Serving populations with additional social determinant burdens and or those who require intentional efforts to gain access to health care is part of the heart of the mission at LLUH to continue the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ to make man whole.\" Every year, ICP works with hospital leadership to ensure the programs and services that are included in the community benefit report are part of \"what counts\" and support the fulfillment of priorities and needs identified in the Community Healt h Needs Assessment. The following programs are existing hospital outreach and supportive services and include some of ICP's work on behalf of the hospitals with spec ial populations of focus. All programs represented in this report are carefully reviewed in accordance with best -practice and guidance for community benefit accounting and are included in the implementation strategy as part of LLUH' s inclusion, disparity -reduction strategies. The following programs are featured as part of our access to health & behavioral health care and services: Agricultural Essential Workers and residents of the Coachella Valley , the region of the Inland Empire with the highe st rates of poverty per capita; Access to people living with disabilities through the PossAbilities program; Access to behavioral health services ; Regional alignment on early childhood development screening, intervention, partner coordination, and servic e integration through Help Me Grow; Specialty intervention services to victims of violent trauma ; Providing patients whole -person cancer care and state and national research efforts through the Cancer Registry services ; Access to care through safety -net FQHC providers of primary, behavioral, and specialty health care to meet the needs of lower -income people with compounded social determinant of health burdens. Access to Health Services: Rural Communities & Agricultural Essential Workers in the Coachella Valley The Coachella Valley, located in Riverside County, contains some of Southern California's most iconic desert landscapes and destinations from Palm Springs to the Salton Sea . Lesser -known by visitors t o the region, the Coachella Valley is also a major agricultural center in the State, and an important part of California's agricultural economy along with the Central Valley. According to Growing Coachella Valley,9 the region contributes over $4 Billion i n agricultural produce and employs almost 19,000 people. Most notably the region produces 95% of the dates in the United States along with other critical crops such as bell peppers, lettuce, grapes, artichokes, broccoli, watermelon, carrots and citrus. The Coachella Valley is one California's most economically impoverished regions in the state ... Nearly half of all Coachella Valley residents live at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. That is 21.8% of the population in 201 9, compared to the sta te average in California of 12.3%. ... with some of the most inspiring community -mobilization and resiliency efforts in the state due to the work of partners like FIND Food Bank, Lift to Rise, Desert Health Care District, and the faith - based Catholic Church partners in the region. 9 Growing Coachella Valley: http://growingcoachellavalley.org/ Community Outreach & Liaison Support Service in the Coachella Valley In collaboration with the Loma Linda University Children's Hospital Indio Clinic and ICP to support the clinic's outreach and supportive services are integrated, relevant, and responsive to the unique needs of the community. CH funded a position in order for a community outreach coordinator (liaison) to facilitate conversation, outreach, and integration of these vital children's services. Prior to the opening of the clinic, residents of the region had to drive almost 75 miles west for children's primary and specialty care services. With the opening of th e Indio clinic as a vital safety -net service for children's health care and a future site for SAC Health to bring dental care for families, the Community Outreach Coordinator helps ensure the community has access to the range of services provided. Outre ach Efforts in Coachella Valley A Community Outreach Coordinator (Liaison ) provides vital linkages to specific schools, neighborhoods, churches, and community members to assess their on -going needs and report back to the health system (ICP) and local LLUCH children's clinic to ensure support services and health outreach is target ed and tailored to the needs of the community. The Coachella Youth Advisory was launched to represent the communities of the Eastern Coachella Valley to strengthen the connection of families from those neighborhoods to local health care resources and inc rease opportunities for health career development and inclusion in pipeline workforce development programs. The advisory is building up to eight local youth group who are the core representatives and an extended group of 15 -20 youth as local advocates. Access for People Living with Disabilities: PossAbilities The mission of PossAbilities is to provide new direction and hope through physica l, social, and educational interaction with peers and their community. This free membership program is tailored to persons with physical disabilities such as limb amputation, stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, and sickle cell disease. Loma Linda University Medical Center funded the program since 2019. The program offers physically disabled individuals who were born with or have suffered a permanent physical injury a sense of community and a healthy social network. PossAbilities is one of LLUH's longsta nding community benefit program as a free community outreach program developed by Loma Linda University Health. Membership is open to both disabled and able -bodied peoples: with support groups providing community safety -net and supportive services. Benefits Provided through PossAbilities : Social and recreational activities Peer mentoring Adaptive sports Support groups Discounted membership to the Drayson Center with adaptive equipment Discount prescription program On-campus cafeteria and snack shop discounts Grant and scholarship opportunities Outrea ch in FY 2 1 While many of the events coordinated by the program faced ongoing suspen sion in FY 21 due to Covid -19 restrictions, PossAbilities continued to offer support services to virtual support groups and outside outreach events, with a focus on social, mental, and behavioral health stabilization and supports. Additionally, the LLUH CHW's provided supportive outreach to the Sickle Cell and Angels Especiales support groups to screen PossAbilities members for increased risks due to the economic and isolating impact of Covid -19. Thanks to the collaboration between the PossAbilities program and LLUH health system CHWs, PossAbilities program members were provide d individual outreach and screening calls to ensure access to critical resources. Access to Behavioral Health Services While many of the LLUH programs in this report provide social engagement and reduction of isolation, there are other services provided through Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (LLUBMC) to address critical access issues pertaining to some of the barriers to behavioral and mental health care in our counties . Referral Support Services to Other Providers of Mental H ealth Care LLUBMC sponsors the psychology interns in training to conduct screenings geared towards the general community in the Inland Empire, senior facilities, and or employer organizations, or with vulnerable populations who may require treatment with a clinical therapist conducting program -specific questions and interpretations of depression screening and mental health assessment results. This is a non -reimbursed service with the benefit of this service is that patients referred to BMC w ho do not qualify for care at Loma Linda's facility are provided extensive referral and support to link them to care provided by other facilitates or providers in the region to reduce the risk of people falling between the gaps between California's tier -based system of care. Treatment Scholarships for Intensive Outpatient Treatment The LLUBMC created the seed investment for treatment scholarships for low -income youth and adults who lack access to outpatient, intensive care programs. Many of the outpatie nt intensive programs that treat severe behavioral health conditions or coping behaviors are often not covered by Medi -Cal or are not accessible to uninsured people. The BMC restricted community benefit dollars starting in FY 21 to give treatment scholarsh ips to people who are lower income, with a focus on students of color to address equity in access to mental health services. FY 21 and FY 22 community benefit dollars are overseen by a committee that reviews residents who meet criteria and determines based on severity, to use the funds to help them with transportation and treatment costs that would otherwise be billed to them as individuals. Access to Early Intervention & Prevention Services for Children Loma Linda University Children's Hospital (LLUCH) currently holds a First 5 Grant10 for the Help Me Grow initiative. Help Me Grow (HMG) is a system that builds multi - sector collaborations an d assists families, child health care providers, early education providers, and human service providers to recognize early signs of developmental or behavioral concerns. HMG motivates providers to conduct systematic, standardized developmental screenings o f young children and providing them the electronic linkages to improve care across the region for children with developmental delays. HMG assists, when needs are identified, in finding programs designed to address those needs. It is an efficient and effect ive system that builds on existing resources by improving access to services for families, infants and children through age eight. First 5 San Bernardino and First 5 Riverside, in partnership with Loma Linda Children's Health, convened key stakeholders and experts across diverse sectors, including health departments, early intervention and preschool education, and medical providers to engage in the planning of a dual county HMG system model for the Inland Empire. LLUCH is investing significant workforce tim e in the leadership of this regional collaboration to ensure it improves the health and well -being of the children not only served by the hospital, but in our entire region. 10 Only costs incurred by LLUH above and beyond grant funding are counted as community benefit in the re porting of dollar amounts Between the two counties of the Inland Empire , over 400,000 children ages 0 -5 have the potential to benefit from the Ages and Stages (ASQ -3) screening tools and benefit from referrals and increased provider connectivity in addressing their needs. LLUH and regional pediatric care providers will now have the ability on the LLUH Epic platform, the electronic health record system, to access the screening and resource needs of children in the program. Making the LLUH Epic platform available to LLUH physicians, non -LLUH physicians, and other providers of care for children in early start programs is one way LLUH is operating above and beyond the standard of care for people in our region. Linkages provider on behalf of children enrolled in the program will help all providers in responding to critical and preventative interventions early in children's lives. 11 11 Only costs incurred by LLUH above and beyond grant funding are counted as community benefit in the reporting of dollar amount s Increasing Access to Care for School -Age Children LLUH and the FQHC Partner SAC Health, is providing consultative support on the establishment of school -based districts in order to extend c are to families where they are more easily able to access community -based services: local schools. In October 2019, the San Bernardino City Unified School District and SAC Health launched a school -based clinic in the district's Enrollment Center where fami lies can access health care resources for their children and family members. While the clinic is currently closed due to the impact of Covid -19, t he clinic is vital infrastructure that now exists and is ready for implementation once students can safely return to school sites. It is focused on providing access to children who currently lack access to care and for children who need vaccines and annual check -ups in order to enroll in school. With school -based clinics and CHEWs working in school districts, the collaboration potential between LLUH and the multi -sector partners is opening a new chapter of increasing access to care for at -risk populations: this is a new phase of development and possibility in the region. Hospital -Based Violence Intervention Program (VIP) LLUH hospitals are Level -1 trauma centers in the region and frequently provide the emergency and trauma care to victims of crime or gun violence in our region. Trauma surgeons began to notice that g unshot victims were often retur ning to emergency rooms from multiple incidents in a cycle of violence perpetrated by their life circumstances and association with local gangs. To begin to provide supportive services to multiple gun shot wound victims and other victims of community violen ce, LLUMC invests in program managers to support safety outreach and education to prevent injuries based on trends in our emergency department. The program convenes community partners in monthly discussions to address trends and needs of populations of peo ple at -risk for violence and through a community -informed steering committee, works reduce risk of violence in our community. The Hospital -based violence prevention program works closely with community partners and the CHW in the ED. With Community Benefit funding, this hospital -based violence intervention program has started providing tattoo removal services to patients who are or were gang affiliated and want a new start. In FY 2 1, the ICP CHW in the Emergency Room continued to partner w ith the Trauma Prevention Program linked services in order to provide peer - supportive services to victims of violence while they recuperate in the hospital and to support patient's re -entry to community with supportive services and alternatives as a way ou t of the cycle of violence. Coordinated Cancer Center Care LLUH's Cancer Center is at the forefront through whole person cancer care and the Cancer Registry team in providing the comprehensive services to the community that are critical to our region. The cancer objectives for Healthy People 202 1 support monitori ng trends in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival to better assess the progress made toward decreasing the burden of cancer in the United States. The objectives reflect the importance of promoting evidence -based screening for cervical, colorectal, and breast cancer by measuring the use of screening tests. For cancers with evidence -based screening tools, early detection must include the continuum of care from screening to appropriate follow - up of abnormal test results and referral to cancer treatment. LLUH committed to treating interrelated factors that contribute t o the risk of developing cancer. These same factors contribute to the observed disparities in cancer incidence and death among racial, ethnic, and underserved groups. The most obvious factor s are associated with a lack of health care coverage and low socioeconomic status (SES). SES is most often based on a person's: income , level of education, occupation, s ocial status in the community , and geographic location. Identified Needs - Specific to our region: 1. Lower than average breast cancer risk although higher than average breast cancer mortality in the Inland Empire. 2. Higher than average lung cancer rates in the Inland Empire. 3. Higher rates of colorectal cancer incid ence and mortality rates among Inland Empire males than the statewide average. 4.

How the LLUH hospital's Community Benefit dollars support programs & special populations In addition to investments in ICP operations, partner investments on behalf of the hospitals, and implementation of programs in fulfillment of the CHNA priorities and CHIS plan, programs in the hospitals that meet the needs of the community benefit target populations and identified in the CHNA are reviewed annual to ensure that the number of people ser ved, and dollars reported are in alignment with the implementation strategy. ICP and the hospital finance teams review all community benefit categories and program and operational costs to ensure cost accounting expenses incurred are reported per license d hospital in this annual community benefit report and on each hospital's 990 Schedule H. Regional Collaborations & FY 22 Implementation Update The Final Year of the 2020 -2022 LLUH CHIS Cycle Fiscal year 2 2 (July 1, 20 21 - June 30, 202 2) continues to present a unique and unprecedented year in community benefit implementation with the ongoing impact of Covid -19 and the recent holiday surge . The guiding priorities defined by the 2019 CHNA remain the focus as well as LLUH's commitment to the implementation strategy continued with the added work of addressing Covid -19. Throughout the shifting landscape of FY21 , LLUH through ICP was able to continue routine operations w ith modifications to virtual or field -based services (with appropriate safety protocols). Development Objectives of the 2020 -2022 CHIS13 The community benefit partnership macro implementation goals that direct community benefit health investments are: 1. Scholarships that support workforce entry for adults, youth, and people from marginalized or populations of focus. 2. Pipeline programs to introduce underserved middle & high schoo l students to healthcare careers and healthy lifestyle choices. 3. Support the integration of community health workers into multiple sectors: health care, education, and non -profit organizations. 4. Increase access to healthy and affordable food options throu gh community health worker interventions, community gardens, and access to safe outdoor green space. 5. Decrease social isolation through multi -generational community engagement and increase access to mental health resources, screenings, and support for par ents and children. 6. Invest in lifestyle interventional programs that support at -risk populations in improving health by reducing social determinants of health burden and increase social cohesion and access to care. LLUH will continue community benefit investments in these ar eas in FY 2 2 with additional emphasis on working with partners or programs that alleviate the additional burdens caused by Covid -19 and the economic impact on community members. 13 The CHIS Report is available on the FY 2 2 ICP and partners are working to adjust implementations and community partner planning efforts that have been in development with a long -term focus on effort and attention to our work in the community in a post -Covid -19 world. The f ollowing collaborations i n development in 202 2 are a sign of hope and encouragement that the infrastructural work to strengthen the safety -net of community -based providers continues and will continue to align with community members to build resiliency. The following collaboration s are in -development FY 2 2: 1. LLUH p articipate d in regional data collection efforts and advance the efforts for ongoing data collection and evaluation through community conversations and surveying in real -time, year -over -year . LLUH ICP has joined Measure of America in a macro regional data and is developing a second round of community conver sations virtually on Zoom and through community surveying. Due to LLUH and other organization's investment in the survey effort, Measure for America was able to do a deep -dive assessment in our region, making the large survey data set available to the pub lic.14 LLUH ICP will be utilizing these findings to further support the needs of our community in FY22. Key findings include: 14 https://ssrc -static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/SpotlightontheInlandEmpire.pdf 2. Supporting the County with Enrollment Outreach, Retention, and Recruitment for at -risk populations eligible for Medi -Cal:15 In FY 21, LLUH ICP was awarded a contract to support the San Bernardino County Transitional Assistance Department (TAD) by conducting specialized outreach services to engage or re -engage Medi -Cal members into their insurance status. The target populations for this outreach are previously incarcerated, black youth, families or people with mixed immigration or documentation status, the homeless, those living with severe mental or behavioral health disorders, and those living with disability and/or are otherwise eligible for Medi -Cal due to annual income. Notable about this partnership is ICP is providing the technical assistance on this outreach service by aligning three community partners to share the intervention goals, focus each partner by thei r strengths in the implementation strategy, and through collective impact report outcomes. United Way Inland Empire is providing rapid enrollment as the hub with El Sol and Cope deploying field and virtual outreach to the target populations to engage and r efer to 2 -1-1 United Way hub for rapid, electronic enrollment and re -enrollment services. 3. LLUH ICP is providing Technical Assistance to build organizational capacity with nonprofit partners. As many nonprofits continue to struggle with the challenges posed by Covid -19, ICP will assist selected nonprofits in one or more of the following activities: 1) Support in grant development and ma nagement; 2) Financial and/or project financing consultation; 3) Program design and evaluation; 4) Pilot testing of integrating community health workers into operations with a plan for sustainability to ensure job creation . The workforce development and te chnical assistance projects piloted by ICP are one of the implementation strategies so LLUH can leverage the investment in the institute's operations and staff on behalf of the community so our professional team working in community partnerships also professionally contributes to workforce development. 4. Finally, LLUH ICP is running special projects and engagements in areas of development to remain in real -time responsiveness to community priorities in FY 2 2 and fulfill our implementation strategy: a. LLUH ICP is engaging with new partners in the Murrieta/Temecula region of Riverside County , as well as a continued partnership with Health Career Connections to create more workforce apprenticeship and workforce opportunities for students of color across the region. 15 Only costs to operate services at ICP above contractual or grant revenue are counted as community benefit dollars. b. The development of adolescent psychiatry services with local community -based partners to provide rapi d access for students in local school districts to psychiatric services, especially considering the shortage of this resource in the region. c. Covid-19 Vaccine education and outreach to people of color and disenfranchised communities where trust in governm ent-run vaccination programs has historically been a burden. ICP is conducting virtual education sessions with health, mental health, and the health care professionals to answer questions and build trust in communities of color. As of the writing of this report, over 275 people have had special access to health professionals with vaccine expertise in community virt ual question and answer forums and over 7,500 people on social media . Additionally, the pre -and-post findings from the IECAAC Covid Faith Summit s show there was a significant change in attitude among participants in favor of the vaccine. According to Rev. Casey, \"People are still thanking us and mentioning the summit [recording] even if they are no t in favor of the vaccine.\" d. Development o f Produce Rx program and linkage between SAC Health and Jardin de la Salud through a community health worker: Thanks to the partnership and support of the Ardmore Institute for Health LLUH ICP and SAC Health have developed a prescription program where physicians can write a prescription and refer patients to the garden for community -based services, health food, an d recreation. A community health worker provide s peer support and linkage to ensure families access services.

Our community benefit patient care services program offers free or low -cost coverage for children and adults with limited resources. LLUH reports only net benefit, or the amount unreimbursed care provided after all revenue has been accounted for, and reports uncompensated dollars as community benefit patient care services. 1. Medi -Cal and other Means tested Government Sponsored Programs: a. Medi -Cal Medi -Cal offers low -cost or free health coverage to eligible Californian residents with limited income. Medi -Cal covers low -income adults, families with children, seniors, persons wi th disabilities, pregnant women, children in foster care and former foster youth up to age 26. Covered California is the state's health insurance marketplace where Californians can shop for health plans and access financial assistance if they qualify and LLUH serves patients enroll ed in Covered California plans. b. State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is a partnership between the federal and state governments that provides health coverage to uninsur ed children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to afford private health coverage. Benefits vary by state and by the type of CHIP program, but all states provide comprehensive coverage, like immunizations and well -baby/wel l-child care, at no cost. The federal government establishes general guidelines for the administration of CHIP benefits. Eligibility depends on your income, the number of people in your family and state rules. In almost every state, children in families wi th income up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level are covered. In more than half the states, the income eligibility for children can be even higher. c. California Children's Services California Children's Services (CCS) is a state program for children with certain diseases or health problems. Through this program, children up to 21 years old can get the health care and services they need. CCS connects families to doctors and trained health care providers and professionals who know how to care f or children with special health care needs. Examples of CCS -eligible conditions include, but are not limited to, chronic medical conditions such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, cerebral palsy, heart disease, cancer, traumatic injuries, and infectious disea ses. CCS also provides medical therapy services that are delivered at public schools. 2. Financial Assistance Program/Charity Care Charity Care is defined as any medically necessary inpatient or outpatient hospital service provided to a patient who has an i ncome below 200% of the current federal poverty level and who has established qualification in accordance with requirements outlined in the LLUH Charity Care and patient financial assistance policies. To access any of LLUH's Financial Assitance policies in multiple languages, you can find these on our website: https://lluh.org/patients -visitors/patients/billing -insurance/financial -assistance 3. Subsi dized Health Services Discount Payment through the Subsidized Health Services is defined as partial charity care which results from any medically necessary inpatient or outpatient hospital service provided to a patient who is uninsured or whose insurance coverage does not otherwise provide a discount from the usual and customary rates of LLUMC. The requirements for subsidized care are that a patient 1) desires assistance with paying their hospital bill; 2) has an income at or below 350% of the federal pove rty level; and 3) has established qualification in accordance with requirements contained in the LLUMC Charity Care Discount Payment Policy.
