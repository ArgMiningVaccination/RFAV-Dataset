I perfectly followed the \"supposed to be\" journey of life for 29 years in the big city. A deep need of healing, curiosity, and divine guidance set me on a 9 year journey into my self, living mostly on retreat centers, meeting and learning from the most incredible angels, teachers, students, and light beings. Witnessing and participating in hundreds of retreats, absorbing as much as I could. My passion for life, love, service, and singing has guided me to share the tools and practices that have worked for me through this beautiful journey. I believe that in the connection with Silence (meditation/contemplation), Sound (Voice/Sing) hides the secret to divine connection, manifestation, healing, and alignment. Son, Brother, Student, Karma Yogi, Space Holder, Cacao Facilitator, Yoga Instructor, Sounding Healing practitioner, Voice Healing passionate. "}
