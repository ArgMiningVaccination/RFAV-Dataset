As with any dis-ease, a strong immune system is vital to healing the body. We can do many things to boost our horse's immune systems: - quality grass hay (ideally 24/7 access to keep the gut moving) - continuous access to clean water - offer Vitamin C, Zinc, Ginseng, Echinacea, and Golden Seal - suggested homeopathic remedies include Belladonna, Aconitum, and Gelsemium (all at 30c). - consider essential oils, Bach Flower remedies, and Dynamite Products to assist in boosting your horse's immune system (consult with a local representative on which items to use). Reducing the amount of stress placed on your horse will help boost the immune system. In addition, we can provide Energy Healing for our horses. You don't need to be certified in a particular practice or method; you just need to come from a place of love and good intentions as well as being healthy yourself. If you are sick, it is not recommended you provide healing treatments to others. What is Energy Healing? The world is comprised of a universal life force, also known as energy. Everything within the universe runs on vibrational frequencies.; Energy healing works on the premise that any disease or illness causes an imbalance in a person's (or horse's) energy (mind/body/spirit); The practice of energy healing works to remove those imbalances and blockages to allow energy to flow more freely; A healer facilitates the healing through visualizations, intentions, and simply by infusing the person with loving energy. Healing Your Horse Either halter and loosely tie your horse or have him free in a small confined area such as a stall. Ground and center yourself by taking in deep breaths and letting the thoughts in your mind go. Avoid negative thoughts. Ask your horse's permission to give him healing. You may ask out loud or in your head. Trust your instincts; you'll know whether or not your horse gives you permission. Once you have received permission, place both of your hands on your horse anywhere that is comfortable for both of you. Listen to your horse; if he moves around, he may be positioning you to the place where he wants you to put your hands. If you don't get a sense of where to start then you can begin behind the shoulder blade or behind the withers. With your breathing, send thoughts of love, prayers, harmony, and peace to your horse. Imagine filling your horse's entire body, down to every tiny cell with love and the beautiful white healing light from the heavens. Your healing session may be as brief as five minutes or maybe as long as 45 minutes. Your horse will tell you when s/he's done. Listen to your horse and your instincts ... they will guide you through this process. Once the session is complete, offer gratitude to your horse and the healing power sources and guides/angels that assisted during the session. After the session ensure your horse has access to plenty of clean water to help further flush and replenish the body. Additional forms of Energy Healing include Acupressure, Tui Na, Craniosacral, Reiki, Acupuncture, and Massage, among others. The key to Energy Healing is your intention. Coming from your heart with love and peace will do wonders to boost your horse's immune system.
