Few studies have evaluated the promotion and sales practices of organizations hosting nutrigenomic websites. Methods: Systematic search and analysis of websites promoting nutrigenomic services in October 2006. Results: Of the 64 organizations hosting websites, 29 organizations offered (24 of 29) or promoted (5 of 29) at-home testing and 26 organizations sold services on-line (17 of 26) or provided a direct link to on-line sales (9 of 26). A lack of transparency made it difficult to identify unique tests; however, three organizations were linked to 56% of all test mentions. Most organizations were healthcare/wellness service providers (50%) or laboratories/biotech companies (27%). Few organizations provided on-line information about laboratory certifications (20%), nutrigenomic test or research limitations (13%), test validity or utility (11%), or genetic counseling (9%). Affiliation opportunities were offered by 15 organizations. Conclusions: Organizations did not provide adequate information about nutrigenomic services and at-home genetic testing. Affiliation oppor- tunities and distribution agreements suggest the promotion and sale of nutrigenomic services will continue, increasing the importance of consumer and provider education. In absence of federal regulation, organizations promoting nutrigenomic services should equate websites to product labels and include information to facilitate informed decision-making. Genet Med 2008:10(11):784-796. Key Words: nutrigenomic direct-to-consumer marketing, internet, policy Nutrigenomics (NG) examines relationships among genes, diet, and health. Specifically, NG research is \"the study of how foods affect the expression of genetic information in an indi- vidual and how an individual's genetic makeup affects the me- tabolism and response to nutrients and other bioactive com- ponents in food.\"1Included among the aims of NG research are to: (1) identify genes and gene variants that may be signif- icant in understanding genetic responses to diet, (2) identify genotypes associated with diet-related disease, (3) modify diet for the treatment or prevention of disease, and (4) improve dietary guidelines at group and individual levels.2-5 Although there is growing expectation that NG research will improve individual and group health through personalized nutrition,6,7the field faces several methodological challenges. Some of these challenges include: (1) defining and measuring dietary intake; (2) shifting outcomes of interest from actualdisease to biomarkers indicating early stages of disease; (3) simultaneously analyzing genetic, molecular, clinical, pheno- typic, and dietary data to account for the full effects of food; (4) conducting longitudinal studies with large, diverse popula- tions for adequate statistical power; and (5) addressing bias toward positive findings in the publication of NG research.8-11 These and other challenges contribute to inconsistent findings across genetic association studies and complicate the develop- ment of NG interventions to improve individual health.12 Despite these challenges, biotechnology companies and labo- ratories (here forward companies) are offering genetic services based on findings from NG research. These services include NG tests for variants in several genes associated with diet-related dis- ease or other health conditions that have multiple causes, such as heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Companies also offer supplement, diet, and lifestyle recommendations based on NG test results and other health-related information (e.g., smoking status, exercise habits, family history of disease). Like the majority of commercially available genetic services, NG services are sold as laboratory services, whereby the laboratory uses an in-house pro- tocol to analyze patient or consumer specimens and prepare a report of test results. Unlike in vitro diagnostic \"test kits\" that are manufactured and labeled with instructions for a specific clinical use by multiple laboratories, laboratory services are not currently regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in- cluding their validity, utility, branding, and marketing.13Further- more, regulations and policies pertaining to laboratory andFrom the Center for Genomics and Society, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

The GAO reported that the NG services provided by four companies were \"meaning- less and potentially harmful to consumers.\"16This investiga- tion prompted the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to release a fact sheet advising consumers and health practitioners to review advertisements for at-home genetic tests with \"a healthy dose of skepticism.\"17The fact sheet noted that no at-home genetic tests have been reviewed by the FDA and dis- cussed several important caveats to genetic testing as follows: (1) some genetic tests lack scientific validity, (2) genetic testing should be performed by specialized laboratories, (3) genetic test results are complex and require expert interpretation, and (4) genetic test results are meaningful only in the context of a complete medical evaluation. In addition, consumers were ad- vised to review company privacy policies. NG services are largely marketed on the internet. Results from four internet searches for websites selling health-related genetic (HG) services directly to consumers have been pub- lished to date.18-21 These studies found websites to provide inadequate levels of information regarding the diseases tested, risks associated with genetic testing, efforts to protect con- sumer privacy, or the management or destroying of specimens post-testing. The lack of information was of particular concern given limited availability of genetic counseling services. Studies to date have focused on the on-line DTC sale of HG tests by companies, some of which include NG services. Rela- tively less attention has been paid to the marketing and sales practices of other types of organizations that serve as interme- diaries between consumers and companies or promote the use of NG services. In addition, previous studies have not focused on the types of NG services promoted on-line (e.g., conditions and traits, genes profiled, recommendations provided) and the frequency of their promotion. Given the potential of NG research to improve health, the inadequate oversight of NG services, and gaps in information about the promotion and sale of NG services on-line, this study seeks to answer the following research questions: Who is in- volved in the on-line promotion and sale of NG services? What types of NG services are promoted? To what extent do websites provide information addressing important caveats about at- home genetic testing identified by the FTC? MATERIALS AND METHODS Search for organizations promoting NG services The search strategy was designed to capture the population of organizations that promoted or sold NG services on-line in the months following release of the FTC fact sheet regarding at-home genetic testing. To be eligible for inclusion, organiza- tions had to host at least one publicly-accessible website with a unique domain name (i.e., address that identifies a site on the internet) promoting or selling at least one NG service. An or-ganization was considered to promote NG services on-line if services could be purchased from the organization, the pri- mary content of its website included traditional advertising features (e.g., prominent product placement, cost informa- tion, persuasive messages, sponsor information), or its website directed readers to another website selling NG services. Orga- nizations were considered to sell NG services on-line if con- sumers could purchase NG services by entering their contact, delivery, and payment information on its website (e.g., on-line shopping cart, order form). A pilot study was conducted to identify a practical number of search terms, similar to previous studies.22As illustrated in Figure 1, 25 terms were used to search the web using Google. All uniform record locators (URLs) listed in the first five pages of results (10 URLs per page) for each search were followed. Web pages were coded for primary content and 26 promoted or sold at least one NG service. All 26 websites were captured by nine terms and selected for inclusion in a broader systematic search. To identify additional terms, the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) code for each relevant website was searched for metatags (i.e., optional codes that identify webpage content in search engine indexes). Eleven new terms related to genetics, diet, and testing were selected for inclusion in the final search. The systematic search was conducted in October 2006 using 20 terms and the three most popular search engines by share of total visits: Google, Yahoo, and MSN.23For each of the 60 independent searches, all URLs appearing on the first three pages of results (up to 10 URLs per page) were followed and coded for web page content (including any sponsored links or advertisements). For each relevant URL, Internet Researcher by Zylox Software, Inc. was used to save web pages under the domain name. To determine how many websites continued to promote NG services when submitting this manuscript for re- view, relevant domains were search for on-line in March 2008. Content analysis of websites Methods proposed by Riffe et al.24for the content analysis of media messages were followed. First, variables of interest were selected after review of: (1) websites identified in the pilot study, (2) data collection forms used in one published19and one unpublished study (Lubin I, unpublished data) of genetic services promoted on-line, (3) the FTC consumer fact sheet regarding at-home genetic testing, and (4) other internet con- tent analysis studies. Selected variables included: (1) organiza- tion characteristics (i.e., name, organization type, geographic location, laboratory accreditation, ownership, privacy policies, staff mix, other services provided, affiliation with other NG service providers, at-home testing, on-line sale), (2) NG ser- vice characteristics (i.e., commercial name, trademark and reg- istration symbols, purpose of test, health conditions evaluated, genes evaluated, evidence regarding test validity, medical eval- uation or consultation services, cost, FDA review), and (3) other website characteristics (i.e., on-line shopping carts, links to other organizations selling NG services, date stamps, logos or seals of approval or certification).Nutrigenomic services on-line November 2008 /H18528Vol. 10 /H18528No. 11 785Second, a codebook establishing definitions and coding rules for all variables of interest was used to train one research assistant (RA). Electronic data collection forms (i.e., code sheets) were pilot tested and refined by the author (RS) and research assistant using five websites varying in host organiza- tion type, services promoted, and website complexity. Remain- ing websites were coded independently by RS (all websites) and the RA (60% of websites). Established variable definitions were refined periodically (every 6-10 websites) in face-to-face meetings between RS and the RA to incorporate newly identi- fied characteristics. Open-coding was used to collect health conditions focused on and genes profiled. Health conditions were defined liberally to include illness, disease, risk factors for disease, and physical traits or abilities associated with age or health status. All saved pages of each website were reviewed, including pages targeted to physicians. After completion of all coding, any differences were discussed until a final agreement was reached. Data were collected and analyzed in Microsoft Access 2007. To capture variation in the promotion and sale of NG services, the unit of analysis was a NG test mentioned on a particular website. Therefore, if seven different websites mentioned the same NG test, then seven observations were added to the data- set. Similarly, if one website mentioned five different NG tests, then five observations were added to the dataset. Each NG test was linked to the website on which it was mentioned. Each website was linked to its host organization. Health conditions mentioned in NG test descriptions were searched in the International Statistical Classification of Dis- eases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Version for2007 (ICD-10)25to determine whether or not the condition, as named on each website, fit into standard diagnostic (Dx) no- menclature. Gene names or symbols mentioned in test de- scriptions were searched in the National Center for Biotech- nology Information (NCBI) Entrez Gene database to determine whether or not genes, as named on each website, fit into standard gene nomenclature.26 RESULTS The systematic search for websites promoting and selling NG services resulted in 2135 URLs eligible for review (see Fig. 2), including up to 30 URLs per search in main results (one term resulted in /H1102130 URLs) and a variable number of spon- sored links or advertisements per search (range from 1 to 26). The majority of URLs (70%, 1492/2135) did not sell or pro- mote a health-related product or service. Health-related prod- ucts or services were sold or promoted on 643 URLs, and 85% (551/643) of these URLs mentioned a genetic-related product or service. Half (276/551) of the URLs promoting a genetic- related product or service did not mention NG services. These URLs promoted social-related genetic (SG) testing (e.g., gene- alogy, ancestry, prenatal sex determination, semen detection and infidelity testing, DNA storage); HG testing that did not highlight associations among diet, genes, and disease (e.g., pharmacogenetic testing for cytochrome P450 2D6, genetic screening for sickle-cell disease, BRCA1/2 testing for breast cancer); or other genetic services (e.g., animal sex or pedigree testing, genetic technologies, DNA analysis, etc). Fig. 1. Pilot study to select search terms to identify websites promoting or selling nutrigenomic services.Sterling 786 Genetics INMedicineNG services were mentioned on 275 URLs, 39% of which also promoted SG or HG testing. After eliminating duplicates, 76 URLs remained. Of these URLs, two presented search re- sults from comparison shopping websites (i.e., NexTag, Inc., PriceGrabber.com, Inc.) providing minimal information about NG services (i.e., product name, truncated description, cost) and direct links to another URL appearing in search re- sults. These two URLs were excluded. The 74 remaining web- sites included eight links to separate domains providing addi- tional information about the host organization or its services. With the inclusion of these links, the final sample included 82 unique domains or websites. Organizations promoting NG services The 82 identified websites were hosted by 64 organizations (see Supplemental Table 1 for complete listing and select char- acteristics), one of which was not-for-profit. At-home testing was offered by 24 organizations (defined here when a con-sumer could purchase or order a NG test at home and receive test results directly with no explicit requirement for consulta- tion with a health practitioner or genetic counselor, on- or off-staff, pre- or post-testing). Five other organizations pro- vided a direct link to one of these 24 organizations on its web- site. Ten organizations did not have a location within the US and did not mention any residency requirements for testing. Resi- dency requirements or state-specific conditions for NG testing (e.g., test requisition by licensed physician, general reference to state-specific restrictions) were mentioned by eight US-based organizations. Where mentioned, locations in which residents could not test or had to satisfy special requirements included New York (6/8), New Jersey (1/8), Rhode Island (1/8), Massa- chusetts (1/8), Canada (1/8), and the United Kingdom (2/8). To suggest its safety, trustworthiness, or popularity, 14 or- ganizations placed one or more stamps on their website, in- cluding professional society seals (3/14), TRUSTe (4/14) and Fig. 2.

Affilia- tion, distribution, and private labeling opportunities targeted to health professionals and independent entrepreneurs seeking to start an internet business were mentioned on 15 websites. Half of the organizations identified in the search (32/64) provided healthcare or wellness (HW) services (e.g., physical exams, Dx tests for nongenetic biomarkers, digital infrared thermal imaging, acupuncture, spiritual retreats, medical spa services), of which 41% (13/32) listed a naturopathic doctor as staff, 34% (11/32) listed a medical doctor (MD), 25% (8/32) listed a nutritionist or dietician, and 16% (5/32) listed a chiro- practor. Seven HW service providers did not mention the source of testing on their website, two being medical centers with in-house laboratories. Twenty-seven percent (17/64) of identified organizations were companies (to include biotech companies, laboratories, and testing facilities), most of which offered at-home testing (9/17, 53%). Across all organizations, one HW service provider and two companies listed a genetic counselor as staff, and one company listed \"genetic trained advisors\" as staff. NG services were sold directly to consumers through on-line \"shopping carts\" on 17 websites hosted by seven companies, four HW service providers, five organizations classified as eVendors (i.e., not a biotech company or laboratory, no in- house NG services, no HW services, offer on-line sale), and one other promoter. Direct links to one or more of these 19 web- sites appeared on websites hosted by seven other organizations. The five organizations that allowed consumers to access their test results on-line also sold NG tests through on-line shopping carts. Types of NG services promoted NG tests Websites included 167 mentions of NG tests using a specific commercial name or generic reference (e.g., genomic testing). The majority of organizations (67%, 43/64) named up to three different NG tests (range, 1-8). In most cases, each test evalu- ated a different health condition or offered a different level of service (e.g., NG test results, NG test results with a weight loss plan, NG test results with clinical consultation). Several phe- nomena made it difficult to count the unique number of NG tests mentioned across websites as follows. 1. Organization without an in-house laboratory using dif- ferent commercial names for what appeared to be the same test. 2. Multiple organizations without an in-house laboratory using very similar by not identical names for tests (e.g., DetoxGenomic Profile, DetoxiGenomic\u00ae Profile, De- toxicGenomic Profile). 3. Multiple companies offering a test with identical test de- scriptions or identical sample reports but different com- mercial names.4. Organization without an in-house laboratory not men- tioning the source of their test. 5. Company mentioning an organization without an in- house laboratory as a partner and the named partner not mentioning the company as the source of testing. 6. Organization without an in-house laboratory mention- ing one company very prominently (e.g., website ban- ner, direct link to shopping cart) and a second com- pany less prominently (e.g., passing reference in response to frequently asked questions, mention in sample test report linked to website) as the source of testing. Given this lack of transparency, two factors were used to iden- tify the most frequently mentioned tests: (1) mention of com- pany name or commercial test name, and (2) verbatim text or identical imagery in all or part of the test description. Three organizations were linked to 56% (93/167) of all test mentions: GenovaDiagnostics /H23041, Genelex Corp., and Sciona, Inc., all of which were identified in the search. By far, the most fre- quently and transparently mentioned NG tests (by 15 organiza- tions) were Genovations Predictive Genomic Testing offered by GenovaDiagnostics /H23041, formerly Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratories. Offered evaluated by Genova- tions were not mentioned by name and advertised as \"carefully selected based on their relatively high prevalence in the general population, their clinical relevance to each health condition, and most importantly, their innate ability to be influenced by preventive interventions.\"30 All organizations mentioning Genovations on their web- site were HW service providers, with the exception of one con- sumer organization. GenovaDiagnostics /H23041does not offer DTC sale of its NG services and interested consumers were encour- aged to contact a physician for more information on the Geno- vations website. GenovaDiagnostics /H23041reference to \"physi- cians\" may be broader than MDs as HW service providers who did not list a MD as staff also offered these tests. The second most frequently mentioned NG test (by 10 or- ganizations) was the Genetic Nutrition Analysis Panel offered by Genelex Corp. The panel is advertised to \"optimize the health of your skin and bones; heart and mind by optimizing your personal diet and supplement intake . . . /H20851The panel fo- cuses on /H20852seven areas in which the link between gene variations and lifestyle has been scientifically established ,... including heart health, bone health, B Vitamin use, detoxification, anti- oxidants, inflammation, and insulin sensitivity.\"31The Genelex stated that Sciona, technology for its NG test.32This informa- tion was not mentioned on web pages providing detailed in- formation about the test. Six organizations mentioned Cellf Genetic Assessments offered by Sciona. The Cellf Genetic Assessment was pro- moted as one comprehensive assessment and/or five differentSterling 788 Genetics INMedicineassessments for antioxidant and detoxification, bone health, heart health, inflammation, and insulin resistance. The com- prehensive NG test was advertised by Sciona as \"an at-home DNA collection kit for genetically-personalized nutrition and health assessment tool that will create a personalized diet and lifestyle report based on a scientific analysis of an individual's unique genetic profile, /H20851so that /H20852individuals can make their most important health decisions based not on fads, but on a personalized scientific roadmap.\"33Sciona (but not the Cellf Genetic Assessment) was mentioned in test descriptions ap- pearing on two of the four websites affiliated with market- America, Inc. and its partner, nutraMetrix. No references to Sciona were found on the marketAmerica or nutraMetrix web- sites. Health conditions and genes evaluated The primary health condition evaluated by each NG test mentioned, as identified in the test name, appears in Table 1. Most test mentions (19%, 31/167) were for comprehensiveassessments addressing several health conditions. Among tests focusing on one area of health, heart health was most common (16%, 27/167), followed by bone 13/167). Most NG test descriptions (80%, 133/167) mentioned more than one health condition, with an average of six conditions per description (range, 1-47). Over 250 health conditions were mentioned across test de- scriptions, including multiple terms to reference the same or related conditions (e.g., heart health, heart attack, myocardial infarction, heart disease, cardiovascular disease /H20851CVD/H20852, heart muscle cell growth). Almost all mentioned conditions could be assigned to an ICD-10 chapter. Ten conditions could not be assigned because the condition, as stated in the test descrip- tion, was vague (e.g., \"aging\"), was mentioned in multiple ICD-10 chapters (e.g., \"allergies\"), or was not mentioned in any ICD-10 chapter (e.g., \"DNA repair\"). Five of the eight areas of health most often evaluated by NG tests (i.e., immune system, detoxification, antioxidant handling, inflammation, oxidative stress) could not be assigned using this standardized classification system. Only 30 test descriptions (by 17 organizations) mentioned the genes evaluated by the test. A total of 85 gene names or symbols appeared in test descriptions, including six commercial gene sym- bols (e.g., BH-2 or bone health gene, OS-1 gene or oxidative stress-1 gene); and 15 gene symbols that were alias, but not official, gene symbols (e.g., PAI-1 forSERPINE1 ,MEPX ormETHX for EPHX1 ). After replacing commercial or alias gene symbols with official gene symbols, 73 genes remained. A total of 256 associa- tions were claimed between groups of related conditions (68 groups) and identified genes (see Supplemental Table 2 for list of conditions and associated genes). Recommendations based on NG tests Most organizations (73%, 47/64) mentioned that consumers could use test results to inform their own diet and lifestyle deci- sion-making or provided consumers with specific recommenda- tions. Illustrative of consumer empowerment in the use of test results, Quixtar, Inc. offered on-line DTC sale of the GENSONA Heart Health Genetic Test by Interleukin Genetics, Inc., which was advertised to identify \"your genetic predisposition to cer- tain types of heart disease. The results can help you determine what adjustments you may want to make in your nutrition, exercise, lifestyle, and healthcare practices.\"34 As a second example, Suracell, Inc. advertised a \"DNA Pro- file test that identifies your hereditary genetic needs, a DNA Assessment urine test that measures levels of oxidative stress, and a recommended DNA repair and nourishment protocol\" inclusive of supplements that are \"designed to interact with five cellular processes that are key to wellness and aging: meth- ylation, inflammation, glycation, oxidation, and Suracell offered both NG and nongenetic Dx testing, and both tests were used to inform health and lifestyle recommendations for consumers. In total, 53% (34/64) of or- ganizations promoted Dx tests, most of which were HW ser-Table 1 Primary area of health evaluated by nutrigenomic tests promoted or sold on-line, October 2006 Area of health identified in name of test Testsa, N (%) Heart 27 (16.2) Bone 19 (11.4) Immune system 18 (10.8) Detoxification 15 (9.0) Nutrition (general reference to health/nutrition) 13 (7.8) Antioxidant and detoxification 6 (3.6) Oxidative stress 5 (3.0) Nervous system 4 (2.4) Inflammation 3 (1.8) Athletics 2 (1.2) Autism 2 (1.2) Insulin sensitivity 2 (1.2) Macular degeneration 2 (1.2) Pregnancy 2 (1.2) Aging 1 (0.6) Cancer 1 (0.6) Methylation cycle 1 (0.6) Obesity 1 (0.6) Comprehensive (multiple specific conditions) 31 (18.6) Women's health comprehensive 6 (3.6) Men's health comprehensive 4 (2.4) Not clear (general reference to a genomic test) 2 (1.2) Total 167 (100.0) aTotal test count includes all mentions of tests across websites, including mul - tiple mentions of the same test on different websites.Nutrigenomic services on-line November 2008 /H18528Vol. 10 /H18528No. 11 789vice providers (76%, 26/34). These Dx tests evaluated areas of health similar to NG tests, some of which included serum ho- mocysteine for heart health, toxin levels in hair for detoxifica- tion, free radicals in urine for antioxidant handling, type 1 collagen levels in urine for bone health, and serum food aller- gies for immune health. Five organizations promoted compre- hensive health profiles that bundled Dx and NG tests or men- tioned that results from Dx tests increased in utility when combined with NG test results. Six organizations bundled NG and pharmacogenetic tests. Recommendations for dietary intake or supplementation were provided by 34 organizations, of which 41% (14/34) sold NG supplements or \"nutraceuticals\" and 18% (6/34) pro- moted NG supplements provided by another organization. One of these 34 organizations based its \"nutritional supple- ment\" recommendations on its Dx test and not its NG test. Eight other organizations sold or promoted supplements that were not marketed as NG supplements. The standard FDA disclaimer (or similar variation) regard- ing supplements appeared on eight websites: \"Statements re- garding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the US FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent any disease or health condition.\" Other supple- ment-related disclaimers appeared on four websites regarding the need to review package inserts, to consult a physician fa- miliar with the brand of supplements, or to consult a physician before starting any supplement program. Six websites men- tioned that statements regarding the NG test had not been evaluated or approved by the FDA. Cost and coverage Cost information was provided by 45% (29/64) of organiza- tions. The average cost per NG service was $442.59, ranging from $89.99 for a single condition NG test sold on-line to $2,200.00 for a comprehensive NG test (i.e., osteoporosis, CVD risks, stroke, cancer, thrombosis, drug and nutrition me- tabolism) including \"consultation and debriefing\" with an un- specified person. On average, NG services offered by HW ser- vice providers were most expense ($529.81 per service), followed by companies ($409.81 per service). Six organizations stated explicitly on their website that NG ser- vices were not covered by most health insurance plans, including four HW service providers, one organization promoting a service provider, and one company. Tests provided by these six organi- zations were slightly higher in cost than average (ranging from $449.00 to $700.00 where provided) and focused on a single con- dition. Eleven organizations provided billing information to con- sumers that could be used to request reimbursement from an insurance company, including 10 HW service providers and one company. Tests provided by these 11 organizations were lower in cost than average (ranging from $99.00 to $345.00), and all but one focused on a single condition. FTC caveats for at-home genetic testing As demonstrated in Table 2, a large majority of organizations promoting NG services did not provide information on theirwebsite(s) that would address caveats mentioned in the FTC fact sheet regarding at-home genetic testing; however, a greater pro- portion of organizations offering or promoting at-home NG test- ing did provide this information when compared with organiza- tions not offering or promoting at-home NG testing. Scientific validity of tests Across organizations, information addressing scientific va- lidity included references to published research with or with- out a specific citation (30%, 19/64), and the genes evaluated by the test (27%, 17/64). Only three organizations mentioned the specific gene variants evaluated by the test. In addition, seven organizations mentioned the analytical (i.e., how often the test accurately identifies the evaluated gene) or clinical validity (i.e., how often the test predicts the health condition associated with the evaluated gene) of their NG tests with varying degrees of detail. CyGene Laboratories, Inc. mentioned that its tests were more than 99% accurate in genotype determination and made more general reference to clinical validity in stating \"this /H20851level of accuracy /H20852does not mean that someone who is found to be at increased risk for a health concern will be affected.\"36Suracell also quantified the accuracy of its test as, \"99.5% accurate. That means there are essentially no false positives for DNA deterio- ration or damage.\"37 Interleukin Genetics made general reference to research when describing the validity of their tests, noting that \"individ- uals who are positive for one of these three IL1 genetic patterns have a lifelong tendency to over-express markers of inflamma- tion. Individuals who test positive have been shown in multiple clinical studies to be at increased risk for early CVD. Individ- uals who test negative for the IL1 heart test have no known increased risk due to variations in their IL1 genes. These indi- viduals may of course have increased risk for CVD due to other risk factors.\"38 Less specific information regarding validity was mentioned by five organizations referencing the quality of the test or lab- oratory analyzing the test. For example, Sanoviv Medical Insti- tute described its NG test as, \"highly accurate genetic diagnos- tic testing /H20851that/H20852can clearly pinpoint health risks which previously would have been lurking out-of-sight.\"39In answer- ing a \"frequently asked question\" about the reliability of test results, The LabSafe Company mentioned that, \"You can al- ways be confident when testing with LabSafe, we use the lead- ing national laboratories, which are fully accredited, licensed medical reference labs. LabSafe provides you access to the very same labs used by your physician.\"40 Laboratory qualifications Thirteen organizations mentioned one or more specific ap- provals or certifications obtained by the laboratory analyzing the test, including Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) (8/13), American Association of Blood Banks (3/13), College of American Pathologists (1/13), Academy of Clinical, Environmental, Research and Information Services (1/13), and other international certifications (2/10 US organizations,Sterling 790 Genetics INMedicine2/3 off-shore organizations). The LabSafe Company was the only organization to mention FDA approval of their labora- tory, as follows: \"LabSafe has contracts with major CLIA-cer- tified clinical laboratories. All of our laboratories are certified at both the federal and state level, are approved by the FDA, and perform the same standard tests that are offered through a hospital or doctor's office.\"41Only six of the 44 organizations that did not have in-house laboratories provided any informa- tion (specific certification or general reference) about the qual- ity of the laboratory analyzing the test. Test interpretation, medical evaluation, and counseling In regard to the interpretation of test results and medical examination, 36% (23/64) of all organizations mentioned ontheir websites the involvement (suggested or required) of a physician as part of the testing process. Nutritionist or dieti- cian involvement in testing was mentioned by nine Through \"fine print\" disclaimers on websites, 38% (24/ 64) of organizations advised consumers to contact their physician or healthcare practitioner regarding concerns about existing health conditions (15/24), treatment (9/24), test re- sults (6/24), and/or medical issues in general (4/24). Two organizations drew comparisons to HG testing when discussing genetic counseling on their website. GeneCare Mo- lecular Genetics noted that although their familial cancer and pharmacogenetic tests required extensive genetic counseling, their NG test \"requires the involvement of a dietician who has been trained to interpret the test results and provide expertTable 2 Organizations presenting information on website addressing caveats raised in US federal trade commission (FTC) fact sheet regarding at-home genet ic testing, October 2006 Caveats raised by FTC Information presented on websitesOrganizations providing information All organizations (N/H1100564), % ( N)At-home testing offered or promoteda (n/H1100529)b,%( n)At-home testing not offered or promoted (n/H1100535), % ( n) Scientific validity Referenced peer-reviewed researchc30 (19) 41 (12) 20 (7) Genes evaluated by test 27 (17) 31 (9) 23 (8) Impact of evaluated genes 25 (16) 28 (8) 23 (8) Referenced in-house researchc19 (12) 24 (7) 14 (5) Limitations of test or science 13 (8) 10 (3) 14 (5) Analytical or clinical validityc11 (7) 17 (5) 6 (2) Laboratory qualifications Specific laboratory approval or certification 20 (13) 28 (8) 14 (5) Residency requirement for testing 13 (8) 28 (8) 0 (0) General reference to laboratory qualityd13 (8) 14 (4) 11 (4) Test interpretation Interpret test results in larger contexte25 (16) 17 (5) 31 (11) Test for risk not certainty 22 (14) 31 (9) 14 (5) Relevance of test results to family members 8 (5) 3 (1) 11 (4) Medical evaluation and counseling in testing process\"See Your Physicia n... \" disclaimer 38 (24) 52 (15) 26 (9) Suggested physician involvement 25 (16) 38 (11) 14 (5) Required physician involvement 11 (7) 0 (0) 20 (7) Suggested nutritionist involvement 14 (9) 17 (5) 11 (4) Suggested other provider involvement 14 (9) 7 (2) 20 (7) Suggested genetic counselor involvement 6 (4) 10 (3) 3 (1) Required genetic counseling 3 (2) 0 (0) 6 (2) Privacy General privacy policy 69 (44) 72 (21) 66 (23) Mentions test result handling 44 (28) 52 (15) 37 (13) Mentions specimen handling 33 (21) 48 (14) 20 (7) aAt-home testing defined here when a consumer can purchase or order the test at-home and receive test results directly with no explicit requirement for consultation with a health practitioner or genetic counselor, on- or off-staff, pre- or post-testing. bIncludes one healthcare/wellness service provider and four organizations classified as \"Other Promoters\" providing direct links to one of the 24 or ganizations offering at-home NG testing. cResearch and information regarding analytical/clinical validity in support of NG services and health claims. dDoes not mention a specific laboratory certification or approval but makes more general reference to the quality of the laboratory (e.g., \"state of th e art,\" \"industry leader,\" and \"reliable and responsible\"). eMentions the need to consider the impact of nongenetic factors (e.g., environment, stress, and \"harmful agents\") on disease risk when interpreting t est results.Nutrigenomic services on-line November 2008 /H18528Vol. 10 /H18528No. 11 791advice on dietary intervention aimed at cancer risk reduction. Since cancer involves a complex interaction between genetic susceptibility, nutritional requirements, and other influences such as smoking and obesity, it is becoming increasingly im- portant to understand how the diet can be manipulated to reduce cancer risk.\"42Similarly, CyGene's website described the goal of genetic counseling and noted that it may not be required for their current line of services because consumers \"may find all the information /H20851they/H20852need regarding /H20851their/H20852 increased risk for thrombosis /H20851as an example /H20852from the re- sources provided on /H20851their/H20852report or from /H20851their/H20852physician.\" The website also mentioned that the internet is \"an excellent source of health-related information for the areas covered by CyGene's genetic profiles,\" and pointed consumers interested in genetic counseling to the National Society of Genetic Coun- selors website where \"finding a genetic counselor is easy.\"43 The need to consider nongenetic factors in the interpreta- tion of test results (i.e., the larger context) was mentioned by 16 organizations, five of which offered or promoted at-home test- ing. Organizations that offered or promoted at-home testing (31%, 9/29) were more likely than other organizations (14%, 5/35) to mention that NG tests are for risk and not certainty of disease. As stated by Gene-Testing.com, \"In most cases these diseases are not linked to one specific gene; rather, your risk of developing them is part of a complicated equation that in- volves numerous genes and lifestyle factors.\"44 Only 8% (5/64) of organizations discussed family history (beyond brief mention of inherited risk) and the relevance of test results to family members. The use of NG test results to augment information about family history was mentioned by two organizations. The Sanoviv Medical Institute website in- cluded a testimonial from a MD noting that, \"Most people go through life knowing they have a family history of a degenera- tive disease like heart disease, cancer or diabetes, but they don't know what it means for them or how it can impact their health down the road. It's exciting to discover what's going on in the body genetically. So if you know if you have a certain genetic risk, there are changes you can make now, and it's worth mak- ing them.\"45In addition, GenovaDiagnostics noted, \"When conditions 'run in families' they often have a genetic compo- nent. Testing can show what specific genetic factors could pose a potential problem for you. Once you have this information, you can develop a focused plan to 'break the pattern' and better prevent your family risks from turning into realities.\"46 Sharing test results with family members was mentioned by three organizations, two of which highlighted ethical issues surrounding disclosure. For example, GeneCare Molecular Genetics noted, \"The main dilemma arises from a conflict be- tween the right of the individual to personal privacy on the one hand and the interest of family members to be made fully aware of available information which would play a part in making important life decisions on the other.\"47The Cedars- Sinai GenRISK /H23041Adult Genetics Program noted the potential for sharing or discovering unwanted information as follows: \"Family relationships may be affected by this informa- tion ...I nt h e process of sharing your genetic risk informa-tion, family members may learn things about you that you do not want known. In addition, you may learn things about rel- atives that you did not want to know. For example, it may be revealed that a family member is adopted.\"48 Privacy Among the 44 organizations providing privacy statements on their website (e.g., use of \"cookies\" to track website brows- ing, encryption technology, handling of personal contact, and other information), 68% (30/44) mentioned the handling of specimens and/or test results, including 13 companies, 10 HW providers, five eVendors, and two other organizations. The handling of both specimens and test results was ad- dressed by 19 organizations, of which 14 mentioned destroying (12/14) or unidentifying specimens (2/14), and keeping test results confidential (8/14) or unidentified (6/14). The other five organizations did not destroy specimens but kept them confidential, and kept test results confidential (3/5) or uniden- tified (2/5). Among the 11 organizations addressing the han- dling of either specimens or test results, nine organizations addressed only test results (8/9 kept results confidential, 1/9 kept results unidentified), and two organizations addressed only specimens (1/2 destroyed specimens, 1/2 kept specimens confidential). Overall, 29 organizations mentioned storing test results (28/ 29) or specimens (12/29), of which less than half (38%, 11/29) mentioned how test results or specimens would be used. These 11 organizations mentioned using stored test results for future research (8/11), and follow-up, future reference, quality im- provement, or accreditation-related activities (6/11). Longevity In March 2008, 77% (49/64) of identified organizations continued to promote NG services on-line. Eight of these or- ganizations made substantial changes to the graphic design and layout of their website, including the addition of a Spanish language version by one company. A modified domain name or a new organization name was found for three organizations. New NG services were promoted by two companies, the first offering new NG tests for healthy aging, comprehensive car- diovascular, bone health, general nutrition, CoQ10 efficiency, and metabolic syndrome; and the second offering a new DNA fitness program based on NG test results. In addition, one HW provider added an on-line shopping cart for DTC sale and one company received CLIA certification for its laboratory. Eight organizations no longer mentioned NG services on their websites, the majority of which were HW providers (4/8) and companies (2/8) offering NG tests for single conditions. Six of these eight organizations were affiliated with another company identified in the search (i.e., Cygene, Genelex, Geno- vaDiagnostics, Sciona). Websites could not be found for seven organizations including one HW provider, three eVendors, and three companies. Four of these seven organizations were affiliated with another company identified in the search (i.e., DaVinci Laboratories of Vermont, Genelex, Market America: Unfranchise /H23041Business, Sciona).Sterling 792 Genetics INMedicineDISCUSSION The present study demonstrates that a wide variety of orga- nizations were involved in the on-line promotion and sale of NG tests in the months following the GAO investigation. These organizations ranged from a book author providing a direct link to a company offering at-home NG testing, to a large med- ical center with an in-house clinical laboratory also offering a variety of HG tests. Similar to previous analyses of commercial website content, this study found less than adequate informa- tion about important caveats associated with genetic testing; however, organizations promoting at-home testing were more likely to address these caveats. The majority of websites promoting NG services were hosted by HW service providers. In a recent study of public awareness and use of NG tests, Goddard et al.49found that consumers reporting health professionals as a source of infor- mation were more likely to have purchased NG services than consumers receiving information from any other source. Al- though evidence suggests that current findings in NG research do not support the use of genetic information to improve in- dividual health, service provider websites described NG tests as a useful tool for understanding and improving the health of their patients and in some cases integrated NG tests into a panel of other Dx tests. The use of NG tests in combination with Dx tests may indicate an understanding that genetic in- formation alone does not provide a complete picture of health. Alternatively, service providers may combine NG and Dx tests under the belief that NG test results have some distinct and measurable utility above Dx tests, to compensate for the lack of established clinical validity for NG tests, or to capitalize on novelty of NG tests. The American Society of Human Genetics highlighted the importance of provider education regarding the analytical and clinical validity of genetic tests in its statement regarding the DTC marketing of genetic tests.50Several findings from the present study suggest that such education efforts should cast a wide net. First, a variety of health professionals were found to promote NG services. Naturopathic doctors were most often listed as staff in identified organizations, followed by nutrition- ists or dieticians and MDs in almost equal numbers, and chi- ropractors. Second, nutraMetrix made an open call on its website for \"health professionals in all fields\" to become \"cer- tified Nutraceutical Consultants\" trained in the use of NG ser- vices. Two organizations identified in this search appeared to take advantage of this opportunity. Finally, descriptions of af- filiation and distribution opportunities indicate a concerted effort to not only encourage the use NG services, but also to increase the on-line presence of NG services through the cre- ation of web-based businesses, customized web-portals, and direct links to the on-line shopping carts by independent en- trepreneurs. The need to establish regulations or guidance for the mar- keting of genetic services was demonstrated by the varied levels of information provided on different websites promoting the same NG test. Under conditions of on-line DTC sale or at-home genetic testing, commercial websites are akin to product labels. Legal scholars have argued that commercial websites for prescription drugs should be regulated by the FDA as \"product labeling\" (held to strict content standards) because web-based information is often similar to the package insert information consumers receive with a purchased product and can be far greater than what is provided in a traditional print or televised advertisement.51A parallel argument can be made regarding commercial websites for NG or other genetic services. Greater levels of consumer autonomy in the purchase of genetic ser- vices increases the need for commercial websites to present high quality information, particularly information regarding product risks and limitations. Clearly, information provided on commercial websites will not be the only information consumers receive when they pur- chase NG services on-line. Companies offering DTC sale of NG services often mail consumers a specimen collection kit includ- ing a package insert with instructions for use and other infor- mation. Studies have yet to examine this source of information and compare it to website content. In addition, consumers may obtain other important information by contacting com- pany representatives (if they know the right questions to ask). Nonetheless, consumers interested in at-home genetic testing are likely to use website information to make an initial deci- sion. The provision of contact, payment, or other personal information raises concerns about consumers receiving adver- tisements for related services such as NG supplements, skin creams, or weight-loss products; or genome-wide profiling services offered by relatively new companies like 23andMe and deCODE genetics.52,53 Six organizations stated explicitly on their website that NG services were not covered by most health insurance plans. Based on recommendations from the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society, NG services will not be covered until there is enough evidence to establish an- alytical and clinical validity, and clinical utility.54The inability to classify health conditions assessed by the majority of NG tests using standard codes for disease states (i.e., ICD-10) will further complicate billing and reimbursement efforts. There- fore, consumers interested in NG services, believing that they provide some clinical utility or other perceived benefit, will pay out-of-pocket. Regardless of purchase, the internet has been noted as a me- dium that provides a \"rich\" product experience,55and may have a greater impact on attitudes than other media.56The internet also is an important and at times preferred source of information about genetics, despite its limitations.57Internet users are likely to come across websites promoting NG services when searching for genetic services in particular, or when searching for other health information, such as diet, nutrition, supplements, or fitness\u2014topics included among the most popular health topics searched for on-line.58 On-line promotional materials for genetic services have the potential to educate consumers and health providers about advances in the field of genetics, and the benefits and limita- tions of genetic testing. On the other hand, promotional ma-Nutrigenomic services on-line November 2008 /H18528Vol. 10 /H18528No. 11 793terials also have the potential to foster deterministic views about genes (i.e., \"I am my genes\") and unwarranted fear or anxiety about future health. Despite the potential for consum- ers to misunderstand the impact of genes on different types of health conditions, few websites mentioned the involvement of a genetic counselor or other genetic expert as part of the testing process. Furthermore, two websites suggested that genetic counseling was not as important for NG testing relative to HG testing. Although the FDA does not have direct authority over ad- vertising for NG or other laboratory services, it has requested meetings with several companies identified here regarding the lack of premarket review (to assess validity, quality, and clinical interpretation) for their laboratory services.13Both the FDA and the FTC have reported limited oversight and resources to monitor the promotion and sale of genetic services,59,60 in- creasing the importance of consumer reporting. However, re- searchers have found that internet users rarely: (1) look at organization information (i.e., \"About Us\") provided on web- sites, (2) remember where they found information on-line, or (3) remember who was responsible for the website from where they found information.61In the absence of knowledge about NG or genetic testing, internet users may use less substantive factors to determine website credibility (and thereby organiza- tion and test credibility), including third party endorsements, quality seals, appealing pictures of staff, and professional ap- pearance of the website.56,61These patterns suggest that con- sumers may not be a reliable source for reporting misleading or fraudulent marketing. Despite release of the GAO report and unfavorable media coverage,62,63 few organizations identified in October 2006 were found to stop promoting NG services in March 2008. In fact, companies identified in this search reported expanding their NG services, establishing new agreements for their distri- bution, and targeting new consumer markets on-line.64-66 The continued premature marketing and sale of NG services is problematic. First, although NG is a promising field of research working diligently toward realizing its goal of personalized nu- trition, there is currently little evidence to support the use of NG services. In a rigorous review of meta-analyses, Janssens et al.67found insufficient evidence to support the gene-disease associations in NG tests offered by seven companies. Four of these companies were identified in this study (Genelex, Geno- vaDiagnostics' Genovations, all NG test mentions across identified web- sites. Second, commercial websites failed to provide adequate and transparent information for informed decision-making and rarely highlighted the importance of consumer consultation with a genetics professional. NG test descriptions overesti- mated the validity and utility of test results and often ignored limitations in NG research or services. Consumer and health professional efforts to gather specific information about the validity and utility of NG tests may be complicated by the use of unofficial gene symbols and commercial gene names on some websites. Furthermore, incomplete and conflicting informa-tion about the companies analyzing NG tests complicates the selection of a \"qualified\" laboratory. In the absence of federal regulation regarding the content of advertisements and other promotional materials, organiza- tions that continue to promote NG services on-line should address important caveats in genetic testing highlighted by the FTC and the DTC marketing-related issues outlined in posi- tion statements by professional societies.50,68,69 In addition, or- ganizations should follow long standing principles for the eth- ical provision of health information on-line.70-72 Limitations Study results are based solely on publicly-accessible (i.e., login or registration not required) website content and may not reflect all organization or test characteristics. Companies were not contacted to confirm the accuracy of website content. Second, the automated archival feature in Internet Researcher\u00a9 did not capture every item on all pages of each website (e.g., video, automated features, Adobe Acrobat files, links to on- line shopping cart, links to other web pages). There were /H1102120 cases where visible links to content not retrieved appeared to contain NG test-specific information. In these cases, the Inter- net Archive Wayback Machine (http://www.archive.org/web/ web.php) was used to find web page content archived at the same time as this study. In most cases, additional content was not identified. Finally, in their internet search, Janssens et al.67identified seven companies offering predictive genomic profiles, three of which were not identified in this study\u2014GenoSolutions, Integra- tiveGenomics, Salugen.67According to the Wayback Machine, websites for two of these three companies were active during the month this search was conducted (October 2006). The in- ternet search methodology used by Janssens et al.67was not described; however, authors mentioned starting with a Gene- watch (2006) report on \"individually tailored nutrition recom- mendations based on genomic profiling.\"73This report men- tions 12 companies involved in NG services, four identified in the Janssens et al.67study and six identified in this study. The reason why three companies identified by Janssens et al.67did not appear in search results for this study are unclear, but plau- sible explanations include: (1) the absence of search terms used in this study as metatags on company websites, (2) the appear- ance of URLs beyond the first three pages of search results (not reviewed in this study), or (3) temporary inactivity or malfunc- tion of the website at time of this search. Strengths Websites identified in this study are most likely to include those the average US consumer would have identified in a search for NG services in October 2006. The review of websites 3 months after release of the GAO report and the FTC consumer fact sheet provided time for organizations promoting NG services on-line to review and improve website content. The content anal- ysis included websites with on-line DTC sale, DTC marketing, health professional marketing, and more general promotion by a variety of organizations. The broad inclusion criteria allowed for aSterling 794 Genetics INMedicinemore rich understanding of on-line promotional materials for NG services. Finally, findings from the present study add to those of four previous studies increasing the potential for longitudinal analyses of anticipated growth and change in the promotion of NG and other genetic services.
