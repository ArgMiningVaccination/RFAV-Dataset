Thriving. Stewardship.", "date": "2019-12-05", "cleaned_text": "In this special episode, Stone Hunter gives a tour of a Biodynamic and Anthroposophic inspired home built in Paonia, Colorado. This special structure, connected to the Earth's currents and Schumann Resonance via a floor made of natural materials, is designed with Golden Ratio harmonics in mind, and constructed of natural, non-toxic materials like straw, sand, clay, adobe/lime plaster. Additionally, special Biodynamic Preparations brought from Nova Terra Community in Italy where teacher, designer, and educator Enzo Nastati headed Demeter Italy, have been placed in the structure for the enhanced vitality and well-being of residents and visitors. Each cardinal direction of the home is associated with one of the Elements, and Feng Shui principles are integrated into the design as well. Stone discusses how the building is treated as a living being, and that Rudolf Steiner, founder of Biodynamics and Anthroposophy, challenges us to think more clearly and deeply about how our buildings (and their materials) - their \"Gestalt\" - affect our health and well-being. Stone Hunter is a Biodynamic farming practitioner and former consultant at Sustainable Settings Ranch in Carbondale, Colorado. Born and raised at Sunrise Ranch, Stone attended River Song Waldorf School and later graduated from the International Baccalaureate program in Fort Collins, Colorado. After attending Evergreen State College and working on permaculture-based projects in Costa Rica and Panama, he began farming in 2013 at Happy Heart Farm in Fort Collins. In 2015, Stone began working at Sustainable Settings, where he completed a two-year North American Biodynamic Apprenticeship Program training with experience in dairy cattle operations, holistic grazing, grain cultivation, draft horse implementation, stone masonry, CSA gardening, green construction, natural beekeeping and more. Stone facilitated the project management of the Arise Permaculture Action Days in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Currently he lives in Paonia, Colorado and is working with Skyhawk Construction building straw-bale, passive solar homes while still teaching and participating within the Permaculture and Biodynamic movements - including in partnership with the Viva La Vida Foundation.
