I had been working with a wonderful man (who to this day is one of the most amazing mediums I have ever met!) and he was teaching me more about my gifts to connect on another level. I was learning psychometry. Psychometry is the practice of holding a physical object of someone's and then being able to do a reading on them. He walked me through a meditation where I sat and then imagined water running down my whole body washing me. He had me imagine myself stepping out and then getting back in washing away the day's worries, the emotions, the energy of the room, etc. This went on for 5 or so minutes until I was at a point where I felt that I had nothing else left to wash away and I could focus on the object I was holding. Over the years I have used this practice now and again when I want to reset myself. As of late meditation has been hard at times. My fianc\u00e9 loves to meditate but he has been through so much trauma as of late he finds it very difficult. While at my house the other day Mothering Healing said \"have you tried a meditation shower? Just simply sit and allow the water to wash over you from the top of your head, visualizing it washing away any tension, stress, worries... then it turns into this golden energy that begins to fill you with love and gratitude. At this point, I begin saying the meditation I taught you guys, love, hope, acceptance, gratitude, or repeating a mantra of the day if I am focusing on one.\" Maybe I am late to the game, but I was mind blown at that moment! Why didn't I think of this? The visual meditation shower was where I begin my meditation practice. I can do this for a few minutes in the shower every day! We all have the power to reset our nervous systems in just a few minutes. If you can exhale for a few seconds longer than you inhale you can reset your nervous system that controls anxiety and your fight or flight response. This is such an easy quick healthy practice! (Side Note: This picture is Eucalyptus hanging in my shower. You can find inexpensive Eucalyptus at Trader Joe's. I also love dropping a few drops of Eucalyptus essential oil while the water runs to get a blast of bliss to help with breathing! Every shower is different, so please test a drop or two first to make sure it does not create a slippery floor.) - Amanda "}
