This self-paced, enjoyable, and unique course will help you gain the wisdom, experience, knowledge, and self-confidence to be a highly effective crystal aromatherapist. it is quite unlike any other course. We know that typically aromatherapy classes are difficult as there are hundreds of essential oils. Learning these hundreds of oils and how each of them affects all the systems of the human body is quite a study. This class is not that at all. Crystal Aromatherapy first ensures you are working with safe oils and safe dilutions, then proceeds to deal with issues of the Spirit, not the body. This is an art class. It is learning to \"paint\" emotions and feelings into an environment with crystal and plant energy. Combining the unique attributes and energies of crystals with those of select essential oils allows the Crystal Aromatherapist to expand the art of using crystal energy. This works by augmenting and enhancing the crystal energy with the energies of the plant kingdom found in essential oils.
