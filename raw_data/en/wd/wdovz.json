This multifaceted program emphasizes the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) staging and scoring criteria, artifact recognition, Positive airway Pressure (PAP) therapy, pharmacology, sleep instrumentation, and clinical experience. Utilizing the standards established by the Committee on Accreditation for Polysomnography (Co APSG), the established curriculum provides students with the opportunity to develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to be outstanding patient care providers and to improve overall sleep health throughout their surrounding communities. PROGRAM GOALS: The goals of the Stony Brook University Polysomnographic Technology Program are to offer the highest quality education in slee p diagnostics and therapeutics in a learning environment that fosters critical thinking, encourages professional leadership, inspires research, and instills a strong appreciation of ethical values and human diversity. The Polysomnographic Technology Progra m emphasizes excellence in clinical care by encouraging students to develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to become outstanding Polysomnographic Technologists and advocates to improve sleep health throughout their surrounding communities. Successful graduates will have demonstrated that they are competent entry -level polysomnographic technologists in the cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills), and affective (behavior) learning domains. THE POLYSOMNOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM The Poly somnographic Technology Program is located within the School of Health Technology and Management at Stony Brook University Health Sciences Center. Graduates are eligible to take the Board of Registered Polysomnographic Technologists examinations to become a Registered Polysomnographic Technologists (RPSGT). Please visit www.brpt.org for further information, exam eligibility, and requirements. Graduates will also need to apply to the New York State Department of Education to obtain a license to practice as a Polysomnographic Technologist in New York State. Please visit: http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/polysom/ for furt her information. 10 | P a g e POLYSOMNOGRAPHIC TEC HNOLOGY PROGRAM Policies and procedures Course Grades It is the policy of the Polysomnographic Technology Program that students must pass all professional, basic science, core, and elective courses in order to be cleared for graduation. All students take a specific sequence of courses during their junior and senior years. The University's Graded/Pass/No Credit Option (GPNC) is not permitted for program courses. Unless otherwise stated in program course syllabi , the final percent grade is assigned a letter grade as follows: 94.5 - 100% A 72.5 - 76.4% C 89.5 94.4% 0 - 59.4% F 76.5 - 79.4% C+ For the purpose of determining grade point average, letter grades are assigned point values as follows: Grade Quality Points Superior A 4.00 A- 3.67 B+ 3.33 Good B 3.00 B- 2.00 C- 1.67 D 1.00 Failure F 0.00 Please Note: 1. Students should check with the course instructor and with their advisors if they are not doing satisfactory work in a course. 2. While most faculty have an open -door policy for any student concerns, more extensive appointments for further clarification of course material can be made with each course instructor. 3. Students having grading issues with faculty are welcome to make an appointment with the Program D irector to review any concerns . The student also has the option to make an appointment with the Assistant Dean for Academic and Student Affairs . 11 | P a g e Grade Point Average Students in the School of Health Technology and Management are required to maintain a cumulative ave rage as follows: 1. Professional Courses ( HHO & HAT ) - 2.50 cumulative average 2. Overall average (all HSC courses) - 2.00 cumulative average It is the responsibility of the students to check their own grades and averages, and to notify their specific course i nstructor or faculty advisor when they are having difficulty with courses, they receive a grade that is less than satisfactory in a given course, or when their overall or professional average approaches unsatisfactory levels. Faculty will also check cumul ative averages at appropriate intervals to ensure that minimum program requirements have been met . Students who fall below the minimum may be placed on probation or terminated from the program . Students should also be aware of the fact that some courses are prerequisites for other courses and if a required course is not successfully passed with a \"D\" or better , then continuation in the program is based on a complete academic review and recommendation s sent to the Dean . Recommendations may include placing the student on academic probation or to terminate the student from the program . Failing Grades Students receiving a grade of \" F\" in any course, may be subject to termination from the program. Please refer to the SHTM academic policies and procedures con cerning academic standing, termination, and appeal listed in the first section of your student orientation handbook. https://healthtechnology.stonybrookmedicine.edu/sites/default/files/2017%20SHTM%20Student %20Handbook%20for%20Professional%20Programs.pdf#overlay - context=students/incoming/orientation Communicat ion with students and program faculty/staff All students will be assigned a Stony Brook email account. Email correspondence between faculty/staff and students will occur using the student's S tony Brook email account. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that this account is working and monitored frequently (we suggest checking your email daily). Missing emails will not be an excuse for missing classes, exams, clinicals, or other program correspondence. ATTENDANCE Courses: Attendance and punctuali ty for all courses is mandatory All instructors are encouraged to take attendance and keep track of lateness. Each instructor has the prerogative to decrease a student's final grade for repeated lateness or unexcused absences. Excessive unexcused latenes s or absences (3 or more occurrences) are grounds for a grade of \"F\" in the course (please see the \"Failing Grades\" section above). The requirement is that the student leave a message for the instructor concerning the circumstances of the lateness or absence. It is the instructor's prerogative to require written documentation to excuse lateness or absences. Failure to provide requested written documentation will classify the event as unexcused. 12 | P a g e Clinical : Attendance and punctuality for all clinical rota tions is mandatory . The clinical site, the Program Director, and the supervising program faculty must be advised of any lateness or absences prior to the start of your clinical for that day. Any unexcused absence or lateness is reason for lowering of th e final clinical grade. Excessive unexcused lateness or absences (3 or more occurrences) are grounds for a grade of \"F\" in the clinical rotation (please see the \"Failing Grades\" section above). Written documentation to excuse lateness or absences will be required. Failure to provide requested written documentation will classify the event as unexcused. Note: Planned e arly dismissals or absences must be arranged in advance with the Program Director . Once permission is given, the student must notify both the supervising program faculty and clinical instructor at the assigned clinical site . Failure to follow the above steps is reason for lowering of the clinical grade. Excessive unexcused early dismissals (3 or more occurrences) are grou nds for a grade of \"F\" in the clinical rotation (please see the \"Failing Grades\" section above). Please note: If the clinical faculty dismisses you early from your assigned clinical, you must notify the Program Director and supervising program faculty within a reasonably timely fashion . Course Waivers The Polysomnographic Technology Program has a policy of encouraging course waivers, and challenges (subject to the rules and regulations of the School ) at: https://healthtechnology.stonybrookmedicine.edu/sites/default/files/2016%20Complete%20Han dbook%20for%20Professional%20Programs.pdf This option is provided to our students so that course work completed at other institutions will not necessarily have to be repeated. Students should plan on applying for course waivers or challenge credit two months prior to the beginning of the course involved. Please check wit h your advisor for more information concerning this policy. You will need to provide transcripts and catalog descriptions of prior work which you would like to have considered for use as challenge or waiver material. Academic Integrity Each student must p ursue his or her academic goals honestly and be personally accountable for all submitted work. Representing another person's work as your own is always wrong. Faculty are required to report any suspected instances of academic dishonesty to the Academic Judiciary. Faculty in the Health Sciences Center (School of Health Technology & Management, Nursing, Social Welfare, Dental Medicine) and School of Medicine are required to follow their school -specific procedures. For more comprehensive information on academi c integrity, including categories of academic dishonesty, please refer to the academic judiciary website at http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/academic_integrity/index.html The Polysomnographic Technology Program considers any unauthorized possession of its previous exams, papers etc. to be a violation of the School's policy. The faculty does not allow past exams to circulate, and therefore any student possessing or circulatin g them is subject to disciplinary action and/or dismissal. The student should refer to the SHTM's guidelines regarding the policy as it applies to the core courses (ethics, research design and management 13 | P a g e concepts), and the basic sciences (anatomy, physiol ogy, pathology, pharmacology). For example, several of the basic science faculty place old exams on reserve in the library or return them to past students upon course completion. These materials may be appropriate to have, providing the course instructor has indeed granted permission, either verbally to the whole class, in writing in their course syllabus, or are specifically identified as such in the SHTM's guidelines. No programmable calculators or other study aids are allowed in any exam, except where the instructor has specifically designated such items as permissible. If in doubt, ask your instructor prior to the start of any examination!! Critical Incident Management Stony Brook University expects students to respect the rights, privileges, and pr operty of other people. Faculty are required to report to the Office of University Community Standards any disruptive behavior that interrupts their ability to teach, compromises the safety of the learning environment, or inhibits students' ability to lear n. Faculty in the HSC Schools and the School of Medicine are required to follow their school -specific procedures. Further information about most academic matters can be found in the Undergraduate Bulletin, the Undergraduate Class Schedule, and the Faculty -Employee Handbook.

CLINICAL AFFILIATES AND CLINICAL SITE DIRECT IONS Note : All directions given are from Stony Brook University. Students in the Polysomnographic Technology Program will attend various clinical rotations during their 2 years in the program. All clinical affiliated facilities that have students attend clinical rotations are listed at: https://healthtechnology.sto nybrookmedicine.edu/programs/ptcp/clinical -affiliates There is also a PDF document that has the directions to each site from Stony Brook University. The program is adding clinical affiliates as the program expands. Please re fer to this link for the most up to date information. CLINICAL POLICIES STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES 1. Physical Exam and Immunization Records All SHTM students are required to submit a completed Health History and Examination Form to the Student Health Ser vice prior to the first day of classes (updated yearly) . This form includes a health history, physical exam, PPD, documentation of a TDAP immunization within the last 5 years, and documentation of titers for measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and hepatitis B. Students must also sign the meningitis form online via SOLAR. If a student has a history of a positive PPD, documentation of a negative chest x -ray and/or treatment is required. State law requires that all students have their health assessment and PPD updated annually. Any student out of compliance will not be allowed to attend class or participate in any clinical activities. (See SHTM Student Handbook for details.) Students are also subject to any additional requirements that may be required for atte ndance at any of the clinical facilities used during the school year. These requirements will be specified after the clinical schedule has been developed and may include additional laboratory, diagnostic, drug screenings, and/or criminal bac kground check s (as required by that institution). Students are expected to make arrangements and to follow up on correspondence /appointments with the clinical organization to complete any necessary requirements and have the appr opriate documentation sent as directed to the specified receiving agency (i.e., Student Health Service, Polysomnographic Technology Program , or Clinical Affiliate). In the event that a criminal background check, physical examination, and/or lab data unc overs a situation which would preclude school activities, the student will not be permitted to undertake that activity. The nature of the situation will be reviewed with the student by the Program Director. The student will be informed when and if clinic al rotations can be resumed. 17 | P a g e 2. HIPAA All students must complete the required Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 , HIPAA training. All information concerning patients is confidential and must not be discussed with anyone who is not authorized or does not require the information for care of that patient . HIPAA training must be updated on an annual basis. Additional HIPAA training may be required by the clinical site. 3. Transportation and Housing During your clinical experience, y ou will be assigned to clinical rotations off campus. All students are responsible for securing their own transportation to/from their clinical site. This includes cost as well as access to an automobile as many clinical sites are not in close proximity to public transportation. In addition, students are also responsible for housing costs related to their clinical rotations. 4. Statement of Risks to Students An SHTM Safety Incident Report must be filled out by the covering program faculty for any student injury. Completed forms are to be returned to the Program Director for review. The School of Health Technology and Management (SHTM) is engaged in the education and training of students for entry into different health professions. The lear ning experiences which must be provided to students of the school may unavoidably create certain risks which arise from essential laboratory, classroom and clinical activities. These risks are comparable to those which exist for currently practicing healt h professionals. In the various types of learning experiences which take place within the school, and at its affiliated clinical training sites, the student may be exposed to safety and health hazards which can be minimized (prevented) by adherence to the safety rules and regulations which have been established by each program. Potential hazards are controlled and monitored by competent faculty supervision, and conscientious observance of universal precautions and safety procedures. Carelessness in risk si tuations can lead to accidents with resultant injury or illness. Within the educational experiences conducted by the school, the following risks may exist: a. exposure to infectious materials including body substances, lab specimens, contaminated equipment an d supplies, contaminated environmental surfaces, contaminated air or lab animals b. exposure to radioactive materials c. burns from chemicals, open flames, heated liquids or electrical equipment d. physical injury from improperly operated equipment or improper body mechanics e. electrical shock from equipment f. lacerations or injury from improperly handled equipment g. aggravation of students' preexisting conditions secondary to educational exercises or activities of a strenuous nature h. skin irritations due to exposure to ma terials to which the student may be sensitive 18 | P a g e In an effort to reduce incidents of students' exposure to environmental hazards and infectious diseases, information regarding safety and exposure to infectious agents and hazardous substances will be provided prior to the first class meeting for each course or prior to clinical activities . Students will be educated about the principles of proper body mechanics and infection control, including standard precautions, bloodborne pathogens, appropriate f irst aid and exposure response procedures. Students who are concerned about their participation or believe they may be placed at unusual risk because of medical conditions or physical limitations are advised to consult with their program director/departme nt chair and/or course instructor prior to participating in any learning exercise which may create such a risk. (Please refer to the Americans with Disabilities Act document in this orientation handbook, as relevant). 5. Standard Precautions In order to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens and to reduce exposure to infectious diseases and environmental hazards, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of \"Standard Precautions\" when dealing with all patients by treating all blood and potentially infectious material (semen, vaginal secretions, synovial, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, cerebrospinal, precautions. These preca utions include: a. Hand washing : Wash hands prior to and immediately after examining/ treating every patient Hands must be washed as soon as possible after touching blood, body fluids, excretions and contaminated objects even if gloves have been worn Hands must be washed between patie nts and after removing gloves and other protective equipment b. Gloves : must be worn when: o touching blood, body fluids, mucous membranes, non - intact skin and contaminated objects o performing venipuncture or vascular access procedures o processing specimens o performing invasive procedures must be changed between tasks if contaminated even when caring for the same patient must be removed promptly after use and new gloves must be donned before caring for another patient 19 | P a g e c. Mask, Eye Protection, Face Shield - must be worn during patient care activities that may generate splashes of blood, body fluids, or secretions . d. Gowns - must be worn during patient care activities that may generate splashes of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretion s to protect skin and clothing. Soiled gowns must be removed as soon as possible followed by prompt hand washing. e. Dispose of all biohazard material, including blood, body fluids, and microbiological culture, in appropriate biohazard container s. f. Never pipette by mouth. g. Disinfect work surfaces after a spill and when work is complete. Appropriate disinfectants include 35% isopropyl alcohol and 10% chlorine bleach. h. Eliminate the use of needles/sharps whenever possible. Use medical devices with s afety features. i. Use sharps in a safe, controlled environment whenever possible, with a sharps container nearby. Use safe techniques when using, handling, cleaning or disposing of sharp instruments and devices. Never recap used needles, do not remove used n eedles from disposable syringes by hand and do not bend, break or otherwise manipulate used needles by hand. Place all used sharps in appropriate puncture -resistant containers. j. Use mouthpieces, resuscitation bags or other ventilation devices when mouth -to-mouth resuscitation is required. 6. Immunizations/Disease Surveillance Preventive strategies for infections known to be transmitted in health care settings include immunizations for vaccine preventable diseases. Students entering SHTM must show immunity to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and hepatitis (unless Hepatitis B vaccine declination statement is signed), and have received tetanus /diptheria toxoid within the past 10 years. Students must receive a PPD within 6 months prior to the start of class es, and yearly thereafter if negative. If a student has a history of a positive PPD, documentation of a negative chest x -ray and/or treatment is required prior to entering SHTM. Each student will have an annual assessment, including a PPD, before the star t of the second (and third, if applicable) year(s) of their respective programs. If a student has a newly recognized positive PPD (a new converter) they must be evaluated by the Student Health Service. During flu season, the university strongly encourages all students to obtain a flu vaccine. An annual influenza vaccination is required for rotations at many clinical sites. Proof of vaccination must include the ordering provider's name, address, license number and date. Students who refuse vaccination may b e asked to wear a mask while at their clinical site. Please note: clinical sites can refuse to take a student if they are not vaccinated against the influenza virus. 20 | P a g e 7. Tuberculosis (TB) Exposure Adequate infection control measures (masks and isolation precautions) should be strictly followed in an effort to minimize the risk of exposure to an infectious patient. If appropriate precautions have not been followed, students who have been exposed to a patient with active TB will require post -exposure PPD s kin testing. The student should receive a baseline PPD skin test at the clinical site as soon as possible after the exposure, unless the student has a documented negative PPD within the preceding 3 months. The student must notify the appropriate individual in his/her professional program at SHTM if he/she has been exposed to TB. A School of Health Technology and Management Incident Report must also be submitted to the program within 48 hours of occurrence. The student will then be referred to the Occupation al Medicine Clinic for repeat testing which must be performed 12 weeks after the exposure. Students with previously positive PPDs who have been exposed to an infectious patient should be referred to the Occupational Medicine clinic where they will be evalu ated and followed for active TB by a complete symptom review. If the student remains asymptomatic, no further testing is required. 8. Student Health Insurance All full time matriculated Stony Brook students are charged a mandatory \"studen t health service fee\" each term. This fee entitles students to be seen by a health care provider in the Student Health Service without additional charge. Students are responsible for fees that are incurred for lab work, medications, and immunizations relat ed to their medical care. In addition, all Stony Brook full -time students are required to purchase mandatory health insurance, or document equivalent coverage to receive a waiver (effective fall 2005). Southampton location students will receive a waiver for the mandatory \"student health service fee.\" Medical care is available to students at Southampton hospital and may be covered through their individual private health insurance. 9. Identification While on clinical rotation, all students MUST wear proper SHTM identification as follows: a. SHTM emblem sewn on the left shoulder of your white coat. (You will be provided with one patch before going on clinical rotation. Additional patches may be purchased for $2.00 in the Dean's office.) b. A name tag and /or ID badge (provided by SHTM or the clinical site) identifying you as a student. 10. Bloodborne Pathogen Health care personnel are at risk for exposure to bloodborne pathogens including, but not limited to, hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These exposures can occur through needle sticks or cuts from sharp objects contaminated with an infected patient's blood or visibly bloody fluid or potentially infectious fluid (semen, vaginal secretions, synovial, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, cerebrospinal, and amniotic fluids) or through contact of mucous membranes or non - intact skin with an infected patient's blood or 21 | P a g e visibly bloody fluid or potentially infectious fluid. In the laboratory any direct contact to concentrated virus is also considered an exposure and as such requires clinical evaluation. Factors that influence the risk of exposure include the pathogen involved, the type of exposure, the amount of blood involved in the exposure and the amount of virus in the patient's blood at the time of the exposure. According to the CDC, the frequency of transmission of HBV can range from1% to 30% depending on the source patient's \"e antigen\" result which, if positive, correlates with high infectivity. If expos ed to HCV the risk of infection is 1.8%. When a percutaneous injury involves blood from an HIV infected source the risk of HIV transmission is roughly 0.3%. After a mucous membrane exposure the average risk of seroconversion is approximately 0.1%. Most exp osures do not result in infection . The CDC publishes a brochure, \"Exposure to Blood: What Healthcare Personnel Need to Know\". This is an excellent resource that you should read before your clinical experiences. It can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/pdfs/bbp/Exp_to_Blood.pdf Effective management of educational exposures to blood borne pathogens requires coordin ation among multiple parties, SHTM, clinical affiliates and the Stony Brook University Student Health Services. Students must be trained in the prevention of injuries and in the management of injuries when they occur. Upon arrival at a clinical site studen ts must become familiar with the site specific protocols for the initial management of blood and body fluid exposures. Post exposure follow -up will be provided by the Stony Brook University Student Health Services Clinic. Exposure prevention remains the pr imary strategy for reducing blood and body fluid exposures. 11. General Care after Bloodborne Exposure 1. Perform basic first aid immediately a. wash the area of injury with soap and water b. flush splashes to nose, mouth or skin with water c. irrigate eyes with cle an water or sterile irrigants Use of caustic products (bleach) or squeezing the puncture site is not advised. Discarded needles/sharps are not tested for bloodborne pathogens. 2. After performing basic first aid, report the exposure immediately to your superv isor/preceptor and report to the Emergency Department or Employee Health Service (as directed by your supervisor). Prompt reporting is essential; if treatment is recommended it must be started as soon as possible after the exposure. 3. The student must also n otify the appropriate individual in his/her professional program at SHTM. A School of Health Technology and Management Safety Incident Report must also be submitted to the program within 48 hours of occurrence. 4. The student must follow up in 72 hours with e ither his/her private physician or SBUMC Preventive Medicine for further post exposure testing, follow -up, and counseling.* Please identify yourself as a SHTM student and ask for an \"immediate appointment\". 22 | P a g e Preventive Medicine 2500 Nesconset Highway, Bld 16c (631) 444 -2198 HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) EXPOSURE AND POST -EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PEP) Percutaneous (needle stick) injuries are the most efficient mode of transmission of HBV, however, at room temperature HBV can survive in dried blood on surfaces for at least 7 days. Persons who have been adequately immunized are at virtually no risk for infection, as evidenced by the 95% reduction in the number of occupational infections since the Hepatitis B vaccine became available in 1982. In susceptible individu als (those who have not been vaccinated or who did not develop antibodies after immunization) the risk of infection after a percutaneous exposure to HBV infected blood ranges from 1 - 30%. HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) PEP Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and/ or hepatitis B vaccine may be recommended depending on the source patient's infection status and your immune status. For students who have not been vaccinated, the CDC currently recommends hepatitis B vaccination for all exposures regardless of the source patient's hepatitis status. ( see table 7) HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV) EXPOSURE AND POST -EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PEP) Hepatitis C is not transmitted efficiently through occupational/educational blood exposures in the health care setting. If exposed to HCV, th e average risk of transmission is 1.8%. HCV can survive outside the body and still transmit infection for 16 hours, but not longer than 4 days. HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV) PEP Currently no PEP exists for hepatitis C, recommendations for post expos ure management are in place to achieve early identification of chronic disease, and if present, referral for evaluation of treatment options. Post exposure management includes baseline testing for HCV antibodies and liver function tests, repeat ed at 4 -6 months or at any time if symptoms develop (abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, jaundice, malaise, fever). ( see table 8) HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) EXPOSURE AND POST - EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PEP) The average risk of acquiring HIV infection after a needle stick or other sharp injury that involves HIV infected blood is 0.3%; the risk after mucous membrane exposure is 0.1%. Factors that might affect the risk of HIV transmission after exposure include: deep injury visible blood on dev ice procedure involving needle placed directly in a vein or artery terminal illness in source patient 23 | P a g e HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) PEP An individual assessment by the Emergency Medicine or Employee Health Practitioner will be made regarding the de gree of risk associated with each exposure. For example, prophylaxis may not be recommended to students who sustain exposures that are not thought to be significant (i.e., if an accidental needle stick occurs with a piggy -back intravenous solution that did not contain blood). Exposure to saliva, tears, sweat, or non - bloody urine or feces does not require PEP. ( see table 2) Students who sustain a significant exposure to material that may be infected with HIV may benefit from the prompt initiation (withi n 1-2 hours) of antiretroviral therapy to interrupt viral transmission. First dose antiretroviral medication will be provided by the clinical site with subsequent follow up provided by the Student Health Services Clinic at the student's own expense, howeve r, the Stony Brook University mandatory health insurance provides coverage for these expenses. Students should be tested for HIV antibody at the time of the exposure and then again at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months. Students who elect to start PEP should have baseline (at the time of the exposure) complete blood counts and liver and kidney function testing, with repeat testing performed 2 weeks later. Students should seek medical care from Student Health Services if they experience any sudden symptoms of flu like illness (fever, rash, muscle aches, malaise or swollen glands) during the weeks following an exposure. These symptoms may suggest a drug reaction or HIV or other infection. Students are advised to follow recommendations for preventing transmiss ion of HIV during the follow up period, especially the first 6 -12 weeks. These include the correct and consistent use of condoms during sexual activity; donating blood, semen or organs; and refraining from breast feeding. 24 | P a g e Bibliography Exposure to Blo od; What Healthcare Personnel Need to Know.

Prompt reporting is essential; if treatment is recommended it must be started as soon as possible after the exposure. 3. The student most also notify the appropriate individual in his/her program. An accident report must also be submitted to the program within 48 hours of occurr ence. 4. The student must follow up in 72 hours with the Student Health Services for further postexposure testing, follow -up, and counseling.* Preventive Medicine 2500 Nesconset Highway, Bld 16c (631) 444 -2198 *If out of area, consult with your faculty 25 | P a g e 26 | P a g e 12. Dress Code The uniform used during clinical practice will be in accordance with the policy established by the Polysomnographic Technology and/or the School of Health Technology and Management. a. The student shall be neat, clean and presentable at all times. b. Students who d o not wear the appropriate uniform or proper attire will be asked to leave the clinical site and the program will be notified. Any time missed must be made up. While at the clinical sites, the student shall wear: Short white \"blazer\" style jacket with pr oper identification as outlined above. Appropriate fitting clothing with no mid drift exposed, etc. Limit jewelry (necklaces, piercings, earrings, etc .) as these pose a safety hazard. No hats to be worn on clinical. Males should wear dress pants, dress shirt, lab coat (with ID and school patch), and dress shoes. Females should wear dress pants or skirt, dress shirt or blouse, lab coat (with ID and school patch ), and dress shoes. Artificial nails will need to be remove d. NOTE: No denims are permitted! 27 | P a g e Clinical sites may allow the use of scrubs. It is up to the discretion of the clinical site whether to allow students to wear scrubs. Dress shoes, clean sneakers (if scrub uniforms are worn). For clinical rotations, the student will dress professionall y with flat dress walking shoes . NOTE : Shoes must have no heel, be closed over toes and around b ack of foot, and be comfortable . No sandals , open -toed shoes, work boots, or other non -professional shoes will be allowed . Students who do not wear the appropriate uniform or display the required SHTM identification as outlined above will be asked to leave the clinical site and the program will be notified. Any time missed will be made up as assigned by the Program Director, otherwise an incomple te (\"I\") grade will be issued. Students are expected to comply with all national, stat e, and university requirements regarding transmission precautions/ protective garments during clinical rotations. 13. Attendance/Absence Each student is to complete all assigned clinical time. Each student is expected to be present and ready to begin his/her clinical practicum promptly at the assigned starting time eac h day and is to remain there until report to the next shift is completed. All clinical time scheduled must be accounted for and it is the student's responsibility to make up any missed time. In case of illness or tardiness, it is the student's responsibi lity to notify the clinical site at least one hour prior to the start of the shift. The student should then contact the covering program faculty and Director of Clinical Education at the start of the shift for further instructions regarding the make -up of that time. Repeated absenteeism and/or lateness will result in a lowering of the final grade. A grade of \"I\" will be submitted if the student fails to make up any time at the end of the rotation. Any request for time off from clinical must be approved by the Program Director , prior to that time, with a specified make up time scheduled. 14. Student Performance All students are expected to be responsive and enthusiastic in their performance. They are to follow directions, be attentive to p atients, ask questions and participate actively in all learning experiences. All students are expected to seek out independent learning experiences, as well as those assigned. Students are expected to utilize all clinical time effectively and should be fa miliar with all objectives prior to the start of each clinical day. 15. Professional Behavior While assigned to a clinical facility, students are responsible to report to the appointed clinical faculty as well as other departmental personnel including the medical and technical directors, the supervisors and the assigned staff. Students are obligated to abide by all hospital and departmental policies as well as all other rules and regulations as set forth by the University, SHTM, and the Department of Resp iratory Care. 28 | P a g e Students are expected to r espect the belongings and personal space of clinical faculty, hospital staff, patients , other students and are not allowed to v ideo record, audio record, or photograph any clinical faculty, hospital staff, patients or other students. Students are not permitted to screen shot, photograph or print any docu ment or information pertaining to any patient . Unexcused tardiness or absence, unavailability, inappropriate behavior, conduct, or dress; or failure to comply with t he university or clinical faculty rules and regulations may result in immediate disciplinary action by the clinical faculty, director of clinical education or the program director/department chair. All students are responsible for conducting themselves in a professional manner during any educational experience at a clinical affiliate and for demonstrating respect towards its' personnel, patients and families. This includes being enthusiastic, mature, motivated to learn and accepting of responsibility (se e SHTM Student Handbook). Should a problem arise (personally, professionally, or medically), the student should immediately contact the clinical instructor and the program director . It is our hope to make this rotation as rewarding as poss ible. Facilitation of your instruction and well-being is our primary goal, but we cannot do it without your cooperation. 16. Clinical Passport The clinical \"passport\" is a record of the student's clinical experiences based on the instructional and behavi oral objectives agreed upon by the Polysomnographic technology program and the clinical faculty. It is comprised of therapeutic and diagnostic tasks that are specific for each rotation and tailored to the particular affiliate. All students are required to purchase and thoroughly read this passport, and be familiar with its contents. Students must bring their \"passports\" every day to their clinical rotations so that they will have a clear understanding of the tasks that they are required to perform. As each behav ioral objective is accomplished, it is signed by the student and the clinical instructor. It is the responsibility of the student to keep the \"passport\" updated and to obtain the required signatures. Prior to entering a grade for that rotation, the progr am's director or faculty designee will completely review each passport. Students are required to return their \"passports\" on the last day of the clinical. Failure to do so may result in a lowering of the final grade. 17. Reading A ssignments All students may be required to purchase texts at the discretion of the Program Director . This will be made known prior to the start of the rotation. In addition, the clinical faculty may assign certain readings that are appropriate to the cli nical topics. All students are responsible for completing these assignments on their own time and be prepared to discuss them during their rotations. 18. Clinical Objectives Each student is expected to master all course objectives as listed in this passp ort. Students should expect to be quizzed both verbally and/or in writing relative to the content of the clinical practicum. All evaluation forms have been included in the passport for student and clinical faculty use. 29 | P a g e 19. Student Log The log will not b e graded but will be evaluated for its appropriateness to the clinical rotation by the Program Director . The log is a requirement for completion of this rotation. It will be used to document daily activities and thus will provide informati on regarding areas of practice that have/have not been assigned. The clinical faculty should co -sign the log daily and use it to plan for further learning experiences. 20. Performance evaluations by Clinical Faculty Performance evaluation s are used during th e clinical rotation. Each one is designed to evaluate the student's progress to date and provide feedback for remediation. The student will be directly observed performing clinical tasks and scored using the passport. 21. Evaluatio ns by the Program Director and/or other university professors In addition to the performance evaluations, each student will be given a grade for other evaluations specific to that particular clinical rotation. 22. Case Presentation For most clinical rotat ions, each student is required to present at least one clinical case to the clinical faculty and/or staff. The case presentation will be based on an actual patient that the student has been following or reviewing the record for and a related jou rnal research ar ticle. 23. Criteria for Repeating Clinical Evaluation A score of zero in any of the performance evaluations will require a reevaluation of the student. In this event the weighted evaluat ion score will be an average of the first and second evaluations. 24. Criteria for Immediate Dismissal from a Clinical Site with Subsequent Review of Student's Progress to Date 1. A failure on the second evaluation of a performance evaluation. 2. Chronic tardi ness or absenteeism which is defined as more than two (2) occurrences in one week or three (3) for the current rotation without medical documentation and/or failure to contact the site, the covering program faculty, and the Program Director . a. Academic and/o r clinical dishonesty and failure to report such occurrences. b. Failure to follow passport regulations. c. Demonstration of inappropriate clinical judgment that endangers the welfare or privacy of patients, their family, oneself, or clinical affiliate personnel . 25. Clinical Grievances Occasionally students encounter challenging situations during clinical rotations. While such instances are quite rare, these situations may require resolution by faculty or administration. These situations may involve clinical in structors, preceptors, patients/clients, clinical staff, other students, supervisors, academic faculty or any individual you may come in contact with during clinical rotations. 30 | P a g e POLICY SHTM believes that the prompt resolution of challenging situations is instrumental in the restoration of a healthy learning environment, and chooses to address such situations in a proactive manner to achieve a favorable solution. Our process examines individual or shared needs to resolve the situation. PROCEDURE Students should reach out to the clinical coordinator of their program if they need assistance in approaching challenging situations in the clinical environment. Resolution begins with the immediate parties involved. It is the student's responsibility to actively seek a resolution by approaching the other individual(s) involved and verbalizing the nature of the situation. Each situation will then be handled on an individual basis. The Assistant Dean for Academic and Student Affairs is available to speak with the student and the faculty as needed. The SHTM Clinical Education Committee can hear clinical grievances and arbitrate should the program be unable to do so independently. Issues relevant to academic dishonesty or grades will be referred to the SHTM Academi c Standing Committee. Students are referred to the SHTM Policy and Procedure Manual for a description of resources. CLINICAL FACULTY RESPONSIBILITIES 1. Faculty Appointments All clinical faculty are to complete and return all documents pertaining to t heir clinical faculty appointments. 2. Clinical Passport All clinical faculty should be thoroughly familiar with the contents and objectives of each passport/rotation that they participate in. 3. Student Coordination The clinical faculty is responsible for coordinating all student learning experiences and working with the Program D irector in preplanning those experiences before each rotation starts. The clinical faculty is responsible for coordinating the students' day to day learning experiences while they are at your facility. As a clinical faculty member, it is your responsibility to accept students assigned to you willingly and with enthusiasm. Your duties will include the providing of on-going clinical instruction ; including reviewing patient records, techniques and modes of therapy, review of diagnostic procedures for equipment, departmental procedures and records, as well as direct patient contact activities. As a clinical faculty member you will act as the student's primary clinical instructor and will directly supervise and evaluate their progress in all patient care situations. 31 | P a g e The clinical faculty will act as the liaison between the clinical site department personnel (ie. department managers, supervisors, etc.), Stony Brook's Polysomnographic Technology Program Director , and the student in order to insure that they are being provided with optimal patient care experiences. Clinical faculty should personally pick out the types of patients and the quantity of therapy that is appropriate for the students. This rationale will help insure that the student develops and learns at his/her own individual pace. 4. Physician Input Coordination Physician input into the clinica l instructional system is a very important component of the student's overall education. The input can be in the form of patient rounds, clinical care conferences, departmental or other hospital in -services, or can be demonstration (i.e. bronchoscopy or other medical procedures). The student/physician relationship should enhance the stated objectives of the rotation. Physicians that should be included are: 1) The department medical director and his/her associates; 2) attending physicians; 3) subspecialt y physicians; and 4) fellows and residents. Although students may not be exposed to physicians on all clinical rotations, any physician contact time must be documented by the student on the daily log sheet of the clinical passport. 5. Record Keeping It is the responsibility of the clinical faculty to accurately keep up to date attendance records and passport objectives met. The clinical faculty is also responsible for administering all performance evaluations and should use the objectives list to mon itor the student's progress during the rotation. 6. Student Evaluation The clinical faculty is responsible for evaluating the students' performance in all content as outlined in this passport. All clinical faculty should try to evaluate each student indi vidually, and as objectively as possible. This includes proper documentation at all times. Following this format will allow fairness to all individuals involved in the evaluation process. The student should be evaluated once a week; that evaluation shou ld then be reviewed and signed by the student after each evaluation. As a clinical faculty member you will also be called upon to counsel students in both professional and academic matters. This responsibility should not be taken ligh tly. All counsel should be provided in an atmosphere of trust and positive reinforcement. Any problems that cannot be resolved by the parties involved should be referred to the director of clinical education as soon as possible. 32 | P a g e PROGRAM DIREC TOR 'S CLINICAL EDUCATION RESPONSIBILITIES 1. Clinical Faculty The Program Director will initiate all clinical faculty appointments. The Program Director will supervise and coordinate the clinical faculty of the hospital affiliates and plan the activities for each rotation. The Program Director will meet with the clinical faculty at least once during the academic year. The Program Director shall, on an ongoing basis, evaluate the quality, contribution and appropriateness of all clinical faculty and/or sta ff participating in clinical instruction and provide in -service or seminars to improve the quality of that instruction. This evaluation will be both informal and formal and will be drawn from student evaluations and evaluations from the director of clinic al education. The Program Director will notify the clinical faculty of any curriculum changes so that they can be incorporated into each clinical practicum. 2. Clinical Practice In consultation with the Dean (or Associate Dean), and the Medical D irector, t he Program Director will insure that instruction in the clinical affiliates is properly coordinated and that all students receive adequate medical and technical instruction, patient exposure and learning experiences to successfully complete each clinical o bjective. The Program Director will assign and schedule all students who have met the prerequisites to a clinical site. The Program Director will notify each clinical affiliate of the dates, schedule of events and student names participating in each prac ticum. The Program Director will integrate each clinical practicum with the curriculum, goals and objectives of the Polysomnographic Technology Program. The Program Director, in conjunction with the clinical faculty, their medical directors, will plan a nd evaluate all physician input that occurs during the clinical practical . 3. Student Evaluation The Program Director will regularly schedule visits to the clinical affiliates in order to counsel students or evaluate their skill competence as outlined in each clinical passport. The Program Director, in consultation with program faculty and clinical faculty, will assure that a practicum grade has been recorded based on the criteria outlined in each clinical passport. The Program Director is responsible fo r all aspects of clinical education. All problems/issues regarding clinical education should be directed to the Program Director . 33 | P a g e 4. General Responsibilities The Program Director will: Provide informal and formal data regarding clinical instruction to the Medical Director and will assist in evaluation of all phases of the clinical component of the program. Investigate ways to enhance/increase student/physician contact. Update Co APSG clinical information on an ongoing basis. Make appointments for cli nical site visitations. Review clinical site/rotation evaluation forms and make adjustments as required. Review student clinical records. Promote professionalism and quality patient care within the clinical affiliates. Provide the clinical affiliates with in-service education and preceptor training as needed. Encourage questions, comments and suggestions concerning clinical education. Keep the program director and medical director informed of all data regarding clinical education. MISCELLANEOUS POLICIES Faculty Advising All students in the Polysomnographic Technology Program are assigned a faculty advisor. Please consult with your advisor first regarding all academic and non -academic issues. Your advisor will refer you for additional assistance as needed . Please see the Program Director for all issues regarding clinical rotations health clearances, and background checks. If you have a problem with any of the Department's faculty or staff, please make an appointment with the Program Director to dis cuss your concerns . Class Representation The election of class representatives occurs during the first week of module 1. The term of the class officers is for one school year; however, officers may run for a second term. The class officer positions a re: president, vice -president, secretary, treasurer, Health Science Center Student Association representative, and Deans' Advisory Committee representative. The class officers work together to: 1) represent the class on various committees within the progra m and school, 2) plan/ implement student fundraising activities 3) plan/implement student social activities, and 4) assist the program with necessary functions where student volunteers are needed. Two of the class officers from each class (typically the president and vice president) will serve on the program's advisory committee and will be expected to attend scheduled meetings. All students are also encouraged to participate on standing and ad -hoc committees of the School of Health Technology and Mana gement (see the SHTM Policy titled \"Student Participation on SHTM Committees\"). 34 | P a g e Financial Aid You may be eligible for financial aid. Please contact the Health Sciences Center (HSC) Office of Student Services with any questions you may have at 631 -444-2111 or visit the office directly Monday to Friday from 10 AM to 4 PM at HSC, Level 2, Room 271 or visit their website at: http://www.stonybrook.edu/hscstudents/ . Membership in Professional Associati on All students are expected to maintain student membership in the American Association of Sleep Technologists (AAST) while in this program ($40 for 2016) . Membership in the AAST is a vital component of being a professional member of this field. Benefit s of student membership include access to electronic media, educational resources, subscription to one of the field's primary journals: A2Zzz, and discounted admission fees at national, state and local symposiums (American Association of Sleep Technologist s, 2510 North Frontage Road, Darien, Il 60561. Fax: (630) 737 -9788, www.aastweb.org .) Summer Courses Our curriculum for the junior year extends from the 4th week of June until t he middle of the following July (Module 9). Students must pay separate fees for these two summer sessions (6 credits for the first summer and 4 credits for the second summer) . These sessions are not included in either the fall or spring semester tuition bills and are considered separate summer sessions. Malpractice Insurance Each student is required to have annual malpractice insurance and will not be allowed to attend clinical without it. The cost is approximately $35.00 per year. Students are requir ed to purchase insurance online at www.proliability.com and submit proof to the department each year by October 1. HIPPA Training and HSC Workforce Confidentiality Agreement All Health Sciences Center students must complete the required HIPAA training and HSC Workforce Confidentiality Agreement. All information concerning patients is confidential and must not be discussed with anyone who is not authorized or does not require the information for care of that pati ent. HIPPA training is provided at SHTM orientation and each student must satisfactorily complete the required on -line exam to be in compliance with this requirement. Travel Arrangements The Polysomnographic technology Program does not provide travel acc ommodations to activities (such as to clinical rotations). Students must assume all responsibility for transportation to and from the assigned clinical sites. Reliable transportation is necessary as \"carpooling\" is not always an option. Most clinical sit es are within a 50 mile radius of the Stony Brook University campus. We are primarily concerned with setting clinical rotation schedules in a manner consistent with educational mandates. It is the each student's responsibility to arrive at the clinical sit e on time and be prepared for participating in the clinical experience. 35 | P a g e Use of Respiratory Care or Polysomnographic Technology Program Equipment and Files Use of faculty computers and school duplication equipment may not be used by students, except on specific learning computers designated by the faculty. Program and faculty files (paper and electronic) are \"off limits\" to all students. Retrieval of permitted files may be accomplished by asking your course instructor or faculty advisor. Program phones may not be used by students. Failure to adhere to these policies will result in disciplinary action. BLS Certification All students are required to have current American Heart Association Basic Life Support for Healthcare Providers (BLS) c ertification. Students will not be allowed to attend clinical rotations if this certification has either not been obtained, or has expired. An original signed BLS certification card must be presented to the program to complete this requirement. Profe ssional Service Requirement Participation in professional service activities is a graduation requirement for all students enrolled in the Stony Brook University Polysomnographic Technology Program. Each student is required to participate in professional s ervice to fulfill this requirement. In order to document participation, each student will maintain a journal of professional activities that includes: Name of student Date of professional activity Description of professional activity including your role A list and sum total of points earned Supporting documents to substantiate completion of each specific activity Letters, certifica tes, written summary, etc. Each student must have a minimum of 100 points in order to be cleared for graduation.

HHO 4 60 - Polysomnographic Technology Board Review In order for you to pass the HHO 460 course and graduate, a series of self - assessment exams must be taken by each senior student. There is a mandatory fee for taking these web -based computer exams. The cost of this series of exams is estimated at $155 (subject to change without notice), payable in the spring semester of your senior year. Kettering National Seminar: So that you may be optimally prepared for the actual BRPT exams used to obtain a license to practice, special arrangements are made with Kettering National Seminar to conduct a comprehensive review course on -site for your convenience. The Kettering National Review Seminar is not mandatory, but is strongly recommended. The estimated cost of the seminar is $275 (subject to change without notice), payable in the spring semester of your senior year. 5. Clinical Expenses: All students are responsible for the costs associated with transportation to and from the assigned clinical site, meals, and parking. C. Books and Supplies All students are expected to purchase textbooks and supplies specified by each course instructor. Students may purchase new or used textbooks via the internet (Amazon). Books must be obtained as soon as possible at the beginning of the course to ensure success. Medical textbooks are a substantial expense for students and are estimated to cost over $1000, per year. Every effort is made to keep required textbooks to a minimum, however learning a professional medical field requires the use/purchase of these valuable resources. Note: When possible, the program will bundle different course textbooks together to reduce the costs to students, and provide them the information to purchase the bundled text packages. The Polysomnographic Technology Program has placed a reference copy of required textbooks on reserve in the HSC library. These reference copies may only be used in the library and may not be checked out. Limited additional copies of required books may be ava ilable for check -out in the HSC Library. 38 | P a g e Clinical passports are to be purchased prior to the start of each clinical rotation, according to the deadline specified by the Program Director. The fees for the clinical passports are approximately $5 -15 for each clinical passport. Passports may not be duplicated. 39 | P a g e Polysomnographic Technology Program Curriculum (revised 5/29/2017) Junior Year Courses 5 Week Modules 4 Week Modules 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Course# Title Cr Professional Courses HAT 304 Cardiopulm.
