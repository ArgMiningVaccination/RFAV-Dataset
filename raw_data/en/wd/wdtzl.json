YOU! HEALTH WELLNESS VANDERBILT FACULTY & STAFF Michelle L. Griffith, M.D. Assistant Professor of Medicine Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, & Metabolism, Vanderbilt Diabetes TeleMedicine Program Leader What is the difference between prediabetes, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes? In prediabetes, blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to diagnose diabetes. Some people can prevent the development of diabetes from prediabetes with lifestyle changes and weight loss. When a person has diabetes, blood sugars are even more abnormal. The bodies of people with type 2 diabetes still make insulin, though not enough to keep the blood sugar normal. Patients with type 2 diabetes might need insulin thera - py even though their body makes some insulin. Patients with type 1 diabetes make none of their own insulin and must be treated with insulin to survive. Why is recognizing and treating diabetes important? Lowering the blood sugar to goal ranges is important in all types of diabetes because having high blood sugar over time increases the risk of diabetes complications. These include vision loss, kidney damage, limb loss, and higher rates of heart disease and stroke. We care about the blood sugar numbers because of their relation - ship to these complications. How do I know if I have prediabetes or diabetes? Your doctor can do blood tests to check for prediabetes and diabetes.

Contact Health 11:33 AM Page 1Q:2uni44A4 Dear Counselor, I was just diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and I'm feeling overwhelmed by all the lifestyle changes I'm making. I'm down and worried I am getting depressed. Is that common? Dealing with Diabetes A:2uni44A4 Dear DWD, Although most people with diabetes do not have depression, people with diabetes are at higher risk for developing depression than people without it. There is no easy explanation as to why the risk increases. It could be due to previous experiences with depression, the stress of frequent blood glucose checks and changes in daily living, adjusting to medication changes, or the feeling of losing control over your body/health. All are viable reasons for developing depressive symptoms. A major depressive episode may include these symptoms: Feeling sad or hopeless Loss of interest or pleasure Changes in weight or appetite Slowed thinking or movement Loss of energy Self-blame or feeling worthless Poor concentration Recurrent suicidal thoughts If you have diabetes and are experienc - ing these symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, please talk with your medical provider. Poor control of blood glucose levels, changes in medications, and other medical conditions could result in symptoms that look like depression. It is important to rule out a medical cause for what you are experiencing. Diabetes and depression can both be a lot to manage. The good news is that addressing one will have a positive effect on the other. Psychotherapy, medication and lifestyle changes, and collaborative care between medical and behavioral health professionals are all great ways to help you manage both. If you have more questions about managing depression associated with diabetes, please call 615-936-1327 to schedule a no-cost, confidential appointment with WLC-EAP. Our licensed clinicians can assist you with identifying resources to treat or reduce the risk for developing depression. Work/Life Connection s - EAP The Counselor's Corner Chad A. Buck, Ph.D. Clinical Psychologist, Work/Life Connections - Employee Assistance Program Passion at Work How do you model Credo behaviors to your team? I find it easier to put others first when I know their stories. Our patients, our staff and our trainees all have unique, amaz - ing, complicated, hard and beautiful sto - ries that make up their lives. After taking a moment to actively listen to the narra - tives of the colleagues and the patients I work with, it is easy to put them first. How do you recognize$reward others on your team? The best recognition and rewards are unique to the person being recognized. While some folks appreciate public accolades, others enjoy hand-written cards and still others appreciate a note of gratitude sent to their supervisor. One size doesn't fit all and catering the gratitude toward the recipient is key. How do you keep your team informed of changes that are occurring in the medical center? We all share tidbits and tips that we hear about in the different facets of our work - place \u2014 the key is sharing change in an affirmative manner, focusing on the posi- tive rather than dwelling on the negative. How do you encourage your team to find well- being? One way to encourage well-being is to facilitate community. Healthy relation - ships are integral to sustained well-being because we feel better about ourselves when we are connected to others and connected to a larger purpose. Encour- aging others to build those relationships at work can make the workplace more joyful and strengthen our sense of well- being.Beth Ann Yakes, MD Associate Professor of Medicine Associate Program Director, Internal Medicine, College Mentor, Vanderbilt School of Medicine, Wellness Committee Advisor 193713 Mockup 8-19.qxp_Layout 1 7/8/19 11:33 AM Page 2Care Gap Alerts Vanderbilt Experts on Health Diabetes (continued from page 1) risk factors, and earlier if risk factors for type 2 diabetes are present. Your doctor might recommend testing with fasting glucose levels or hemoglobin A1c testing. Hemoglobin A1c is a blood test that indicates the average blood sugar over the past 3 months. Symptoms that should prompt you to ask about testing include increased thirst, increased urination, frequent urinary tract or yeast infections, and unexplained weight loss. What can I do to reduce my risk of developing prediabetes or diabetes? Maintaining a healthy weight, ideally with a body mass index less than 25, can reduce risk of both prediabetes and diabetes. If you are overweight or obese, a 7% loss of body weight reduces your risk of diabetes. Being physically active also helps. If you are not physically active, work toward a goal of 150 minutes per week of activi- ty such as brisk walking. If you have been diagnosed with prediabetes, join - ing a Diabetes Prevention Program can help you make the lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of progressing to diabetes. For more information, visit: vanderbi.lt/dpp . Is there technology that can support preventing or managing diabetes? Smartphone apps can be helpful for tracking calories or carbohydrates. MyFitnessPal and CalorieKing are two useful examples. There are ways to test blood sugar levels at home. However, home monitoring is not rec - ommended for patients with predia - betes. Furthermore, not all patients with diabetes need to test at home, but if your doctor has asked you to do so, following your doctor's recommenda - tions is important for two reasons. First, it can help you understand how foods and activities affect your blood sugar. Second, knowing exactly when your blood sugar is high or low helps your doctor determine what treatments are best for you. The measles virus went from being declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 to over 1,000 total cases reported across 28 states since the beginning of 2019. That's quite an alarming turn of events! The rise of measles is related to declining vaccination rates over the past decade, primarily due to the unsupported suspicion of a link between autism and MMR vaccination. Dr. Katherine Edwards, S. Sell and C. Vanderbilt Chair in Pediatrics, reinforces, \"Measles vaccine is extremely safe and effective, but it must be administered for it to work.\" We need to remember that measles can affect everyone, but it can be particularly devastating for babies and young children. Here are some quick facts on measles and its complications from the CDC: Measles is extremely contagious; up to 90% of susceptible people with close contact to someone with measles will develop the disease. 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles end up hospitalized. 1 in 20 children with measles get pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in young children. 1 in 1,000 children with measles develop brain swelling that can cause convul- sions and lead to deafness or intellectual disability. 1 to 3 of 1,000 children with measles will die from respiratory and neurological complications. It's everyone's responsibility to stay measles-free, since only a small decline in vaccination rate can lead to an outbreak. Dr. Edwards cautions, \"Unvaccinated indi- viduals pose risks to infants too young to be vaccinated, individuals with immune defects from birth or medications for treatment of cancer or other medical condi- tions who cannot be immunized, and even those who have been vaccinated. We need vaccination rates of at least 95% to prevent transmission.\" So, whatever your age, it's important to check your vaccination status with your health care provider!Occupational Health Clinic talk: Don't Weasel out of Measles!

I would also say it's in contrast to surviving. That's a very low bar. People really don't want merely to survive. They really want to thrive.\" - Jim Jackson, PsyD Five Factors that Optimize the Brain for Thriving Regular Exercise The goal is to get active every day! Start small and keep going until it becomes a regular habit. \"Exercise has many different effects on brain health, all of which are good. Exercise activates systems that are engaged in helping us be able to concentrate, to focus our attention, and to be able to remember things and to learn.\" - Jeanette Norden, MD The Right Foods Diet can have both positive and negative impacts on brain health. It's time to start limiting foods that are damaging to the brain and increasing foods that support healthy brain function! \"The first step that one can take to begin eating a brain-healthy diet is to make a decision that your brain health is just as important as the rest of your physical health. We can start to take in good fats, like omega-3s, whole grains, and antioxidants to prevent our cells from being damaged, allowing our brain to have proper structure and to have proper function. These things are going to lead to increased performance.\" - Rena Robinson, PhD Reducing Stress We can't always stop stress from happening, but we can control how we respond to it. \"If we have learned how to cope with stress, and we have learned coping techniques that keep our brain healthy, it helps us take a step back in our daily lives, helping us realize we can deal with stress, and then you have more time to deal with the things that are really important that you really want to do, and that's a piece of thriving.\" - Warren Taylor, MD Good Sleep We all know that feeling of thriving after we've had a good night's sleep. Getting enough sleep and getting deep sleep are critical to thriving now and in the future. \"Good sleep is restorative sleep. It is during deep, restorative sleep that molecules that build up during the day that could potentially cause problems for us later on in our lives, are removed from the brain.\" - Jeanette Norden, MD New Experiences New learning experiences and new social experiences can promote brain health to promote thriving in our lives. \"For a long time, we thought that parts of the brain you use for other activities, you also use in social activities, and it turns out that is not true. You get to activate a different part of your brain when you are interacting socially.\" - Consuelo Wilkins, MD 193713 Mockup 8-19.qxp_Layout 1 7/8/19 11:33 AM Page 4Beat the Heat! 5 Ways to Stay Active in the Hot Weather Staying active in hot weather is not easy for many people. August in Tennessee doesn't exactly scream exercise weather. Dealing with heat and humidity can make it difficult to get outside and get moving. But you don't have to put your workout routine on the back burner just because it feels too hot to exercise.

Here are 5 ideas to help you stay active this summer: Stretch with the sun \u2014 On days when you know it's going to be a scorcher, set your alarm for an early morning workout. Take your workouts inside \u2014 Exercising in an air-conditioned gym (or home) is the best way to keep cool. Try an exercise DVD or YouTube video at home. Get a wet workout \u2014 Try swimming, water aerobics, or a new activity like paddle-boarding or water volleyball. End your day with a walk \u2014 When the sun is low, temperatures aren't as high. It can be a nice way to relax after a long day. Be sure to keep yourself hydrated when you exercise in the heat. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after. Another source of water is from the food we eat, including fruit. Try the refreshing fruit salad recipe to the right!193713 Mockup 8-19.qxp_Layout 1 7/8/19 11:33 AM Page 5 HR Corner Getting The Most Out of Your Benefits Back to SchoolBASICSFrom tutors to telemedicine, your VUMC benets can help you and your family get ready for back to school Care.com M o s t p a r e n t s w i l l a g r e e t h a t h o m e w o r k i s h a r d e r t h a n i t u s e d t o b e .
