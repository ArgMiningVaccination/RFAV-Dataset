In the past two decades, deaths of despair from suicide, drug overdose, and alcoholism have risen dramatically, and now claim hundreds of thousands of American lives each year\u2014 and they're still rising. Anne Case and Angus Deaton, known for first sounding the alarm about deaths of despair, explain the overwhelm- ing surge in these deaths and shed light on the social and economic forces that are making life harder for the working class. They demon- strate why, for those who used to prosper in America, capitalism is no longer delivering. Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism paints a troubling portrait of the American dream in decline. For the white working class, today's America has become a land of broken families and few prospects. As the college educated become healthier and wealthier, adults without a degree are literally dying from pain and despair. In this critically important book, Case and Deaton tie the crisis to the weakening position of labor, the growing power of corporations, and, above all, to a rapacious health-care sector that redistributes working-class wages into the pockets of the wealthy. Capitalism, which over two centuries lifted countless people out of poverty, is now destroying the lives of blue-collar America. This book charts a way forward, providing solutions that can rein in capitalism's excesses and make it work for everyone. Anne Case is the Alexander Stewart 1886 Professor of Economics and Public Affairs Emeritus at Princeton University. Angus Deaton, winner of the 2015 Nobel Prize in economics, is the Dwight D.

POWELL & KIM SAJET From the moment of their unveiling at the National Portrait Gallery in early 2018, the portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama have become two of the most beloved artworks of our time. Kehinde Wiley's portrait of President Obama and Amy Sherald's portrait of the former first lady have inspired unprecedented responses from the public, and attendance at the museum has more than doubled as visitors travel from near and far to view these larger-than-life paintings. After witnessing a woman drop to her knees in prayer before the portrait of Barack Obama, one guard said, \"No other painting gets the same kind of reactions. Ever.\" The Obama Portraits is the first book about the making, meaning, and significance of these remarkable artworks. Richly illustrated with images of the portraits, exclusive pictures of the Obamas with the artists during their sittings, and photos of the historic unveiling ceremony by former White House photographer Pete Souza, this book offers insight into what these paintings can tell us about the history of portraiture and American culture. The volume also features a transcript of the unveiling ceremony, which includes moving remarks by the Obamas and the artists. An inspiring history of the creation and impact of the Obama portraits, this fascinating book speaks to the power of art\u2014especially portraiture\u2014to bring people together and promote cultural change.

Hunter Waite, Southwest Research InstituteAlien Oceans The Search for Life in the Depths of Space KEVIN PETER HAND Where is the best place to find life beyond Earth? We often look to Mars as the most promising site in our solar system, but recent scientific missions have revealed that some of the most habitable real estate may actually lie farther away. Beneath the frozen crusts of several of the small, ice-covered moons of Jupiter and Saturn lurk vast oceans that may have been in existence for as long as Earth, and together may contain more than fifty times its total volume of liquid water. Could there be organisms living in their depths? Alien Oceans reveals the science behind the thrilling quest to find out. Kevin Peter Hand is one of today's leading NASA scientists, and his pioneering research has taken him on expeditions around the world. In this captivating account of scientific discovery, he brings together insights from planetary science, biology, and the adventures of scientists like himself to explain how we know that oceans exist within moons of the outer solar system, like Europa, Titan, and Enceladus. He shows how the exploration of Earth's ocean is informing our understanding of the potential habitability of these icy moons, and draws lessons from what we have learned about the origins of life on our own planet to consider how life could arise on these distant worlds. Alien Oceans describes what lies ahead in our search for life in our solar system and beyond, setting the stage for the transformative discoveries that may await us. Kevin Peter Hand is a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he has served as deputy chief scientist for solar system exploration and is leading an effort to land a spacecraft on the surface of Europa. He has helped lead expeditions to the glaciers of Kilimanjaro, the Dry Valleys of Antarctica, and the sea ice of the North Pole. He lives in Los Angeles.

Al-Khalili begins by introducing the fundamental concepts of space, time, energy, and matter, and then describes the three pillars of modern physics\u2014quantum theory, relativity, and thermodynam- ics\u2014showing how all three must come together if we are ever to have a full understanding of reality. Using wonderful examples and thought-provoking analogies, Al-Khalili illuminates the physics of the extreme cosmic and quantum scales, the speculative frontiers of the field, and the physics that underpins our everyday experiences and technologies, bringing the reader up to speed with the biggest ideas in physics in just a few sittings. Physics is revealed as an intrepid human quest for ever more foundational principles that accurately explain the natural world we see around us, an undertaking guided by core values such as honesty and doubt in the search for truth. The knowledge discovered by physics both empowers and humbles us, and still, physics continues to delve valiantly into the unknown. Making even the most enigmatic scientific ideas accessible and captivating, this deeply insightful book illuminates why physics matters to everyone and calls one and all to share in the profound adventure of seeking truth in the world around us.

But evolution and cancer are closely linked, for the historical processes that created life also created cancer. The Cheating Cell delves into this extraordinary relationship, and shows that by understanding cancer's evolutionary origins, researchers can come up with more effective, revolutionary treatments. Athena Aktipis goes back billions of years to explore when uni- cellular forms became multicellular organisms. Within these bodies of cooperating cells, cheating ones arose, overusing resources and replicating out of control, giving rise to cancer. Aktipis illustrates how evolution has paved the way for cancer's ubiquity, and why it will exist as long as multicellular life does. Even so, she argues, this doesn't mean we should give up on treating cancer\u2014in fact evolutionary approaches offer new and promising options for the disease's prevention and treatments that aim at long-term manage- ment rather than simple eradication. Looking across species\u2014from sponges and cacti to dogs and elephants\u2014we are discovering new mechanisms of tumor suppression and the many ways that mul- ticellular life-forms have evolved to keep cancer under control. By accepting that cancer is a part of our biological past, present, and future\u2014and that we cannot win a war against evolution\u2014treatments can become smarter, more strategic, and more humane. Unifying the latest research from biology, ecology, medicine, and social science, The Cheating Cell challenges us to rethink can- cer's fundamental nature and our relationship to it.

The secrets of this vast frozen desert have long tempted explorers, but its brutal climate and glacial shores notoriously resist human intrusion. Land of Wondrous Cold tells a gripping story of the pioneering nineteenth-century voyages, when British, French, and American commanders raced to penetrate Antarctica's glacial rim for unknown lands beyond. These intrepid Victorian explorers\u2014James Ross, Dumont D'Urville, and Charles Wilkes\u2014laid the foundation for our current understanding of Terra Australis Incognita. Today, the white continent poses new challenges, as scien- tists race to uncover Earth's climate history, which is recorded in the south polar ice and ocean floor, and to monitor the increasing instability of the Antarctic ice cap, which threatens to inundate coastal cities worldwide. Interweaving the breakthrough research of the modern Ocean Drilling Program with the dramatic discovery tales of their Victorian forerunners, Gillen D'Arcy Wood describes Antarctica's role in a planetary drama of plate tectonics, climate change, and species evolution stretching back more than thirty mil- lion years.

What has changed in our post-truth, postindustrial world is that we often feel overwhelmed by the constant flood of information and misinformation. It sometimes seems impossible to differentiate between truth and falsehood and, as a result, there has been a back- lash against the idea of expertise, and a rise in the number of people actively choosing not to know. The dangers of this are obvious, but Salecl challenges our assumptions, arguing that there may also be a positive side to ignorance, and that, by addressing its role in society, we may be able to reclaim the role of knowledge. Drawing on philosophy, social and psychoanalytic theory, pop- ular culture, and her own experience, Salecl explores how the passion for ignorance plays out in many different aspects of life today, from love, illness, trauma, and the fear of failure to genetics, forensic science, big data, and the Incel movement\u2014and she concludes that ignorance is a complex phenomenon that can, on occasion, benefit individuals and society as a whole. The result is a fascinating investigation of how the knowledge economy became an ignorance economy, what it means for us, and what it tells us about the world today.

That combi- nation is on display again in his Sick Souls, Healthy Minds \u2014a brief and powerful book about one of America's most profound minds, William James, and what he can teach us about what makes life worth living.\" \u2014Robert D. Richardson, author of William James: In the Maelstrom of American Modernism Sick Souls, Healthy Minds How William James Can Save Your Life JOHN KAAG In 1895, William James, the father of American philosophy, deliv- ered a lecture entitled \"Is Life Worth Living?\" It was no theoretical question for James, who had contemplated suicide during an existential crisis as a young man a quarter century earlier. Indeed, as John Kaag writes, \"James's entire philosophy, from beginning to end, was geared to save a life, his life\"\u2014and that's why it just might be able to save yours, too. Sick Souls, Healthy Minds is a compelling introduction to James's life and thought that shows why the founder of pragmatism and empirical psychology\u2014and an inspiration for Alcoholics Anonymous\u2014can still speak so directly and profoundly to anyone struggling to make a life worth living. Kaag tells how James's experiences as one of what he called the \"sick-souled,\" those who think that life might be meaningless, drove him to articulate an ideal of \"healthy-mindedness\"\u2014an atti- tude toward life that is open, active, and hopeful, but also realistic about its risks. In fact, all of James's pragmatism, resting on the idea that truth should be judged by its practical consequences for our lives, is a response to, and possible antidote for, crises of meaning that threaten to undo many of us at one time or another. Along the way, Kaag also movingly describes how his own life has been end- lessly enriched by James. Eloquent, inspiring, and filled with insight, Sick Souls, Healthy Minds may be the smartest and most important self-help book you'll ever read. John Kaag is the author of American Philosophy: A Love Story , which was named a New York Times Editors' Choice and an NPR Best Book of the year, and Hiking with Nietzsche: On Becoming Who You Are, which was also an NPR Best Book of the year.

These \"girls\" enhance the status of the men and enrich club owners, exchanging their bodily capital for as little as free drinks and a chance to party with men who are rich or aspire to be.

Using such social media platforms as YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram, they're capitalizing on the public's fascination with the ghetto and gang violence. But with what consequences? Ballad of the Bullet follows the Corner Boys, a group of thirty or so young men on Chicago's South Side who have hitched their dreams of success to the creation of \"drill music\" (slang for \"shooting music\"). Drillers hyperviolent, hyperlocal, DIY- style gangsta rap digitally, hoping to amass millions of clicks, views, followers\u2014and a ticket out of poverty. But in this perverse system of benefits, where online popularity can convert into offline rewards, the risks can be too great. Drawing on extensive fieldwork and countless interviews compiled from daily, close interactions with the Corner Boys, as well as time spent with their families, friends, music producers, and followers, Forrest Stuart looks at the lives and motivations of these young men. Stuart examines why drillers choose to embrace rather than distance themselves from negative stereotypes, using the web to assert their supposed superior criminality over rival gangs. While these virtual displays of ghetto authenticity\u2014the saturation of social media with images of guns, drugs, and urban warfare\u2014can lead to online notoriety and actual resources, including cash, housing, guns, sex, and, for a select few, upward mobility, drillers frequently end up behind bars, seriously injured, or dead. Raising questions about online celebrity, public voyeurism, and the commodification of the ghetto, Ballad of the Bullet offers a singular look at what happens when the digital economy and urban poverty collide.

Enlivened by fasci- nating characters, beautiful passages, and riveting examples, Porcelain will appeal to all lovers of china as well as those who are interested in design, consumption, and luxury.\" \u2014Frank Trentmann, author of Empire of ThingsA sweeping cultural and economic history of porcelain, from the eighteenth century to the presentPorcelain A History from the Heart of Europe SUZANNE L. MARCHAND Porcelain was invented in medieval China\u2014but its secret recipe was first reproduced in Europe by an alchemist in the employ of the Saxon king Augustus the Strong. Saxony's revered Meissen factory could not keep porcelain's ingredients secret for long, however, and scores of Holy Roman princes quickly founded their own mercantile manufactories, soon to be rivaled by private entrepreneurs, eager to make not art but profits. As porcelain's uses multiplied and its price plummeted, it lost much of its identity as aristocratic ornament, instead taking on a vast number of banal, yet even more cultur- ally significant, roles. By the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it became essential to bourgeois dining, and also acquired new func- tions in insulator tubes, shell casings, and teeth. Weaving together the experiences of entrepreneurs and artisans, state bureaucrats and female consumers, chemists and peddlers, Porcelain traces the remarkable story of \"white gold\" from its origins as a princely luxury item to its fate in Germany's cataclys- mic twentieth century. For three hundred years, porcelain firms have come and gone, but the industry itself, at least until very recently, has endured. After Augustus, porcelain became a quintessentially German commodity, integral to provincial pride, artisanal industrial production, and a familial sense of home. Telling the story of porcelain's transformation from coveted luxury to household necessity and flea market staple, Porcelain offers a fascinating alternative history of art, business, taste, and consump- tion in Central Europe.

Brown, author of Gentlemen and Officers: Imperial Administration and Aristocratic Power in Byzantine Italy, AD 554-800Ravenna Crucible of Europe JUDITH HERRIN At the end of the fourth century, as the power of Rome faded and Constantinople became the seat of empire, a new capital city was rising in the West. Here, in Ravenna on the coast of Italy, Arian Goths and Catholic Romans competed to produce an unrivaled concentra- tion of buildings and astonishing mosaics. For three centuries, the city attracted scholars, lawyers, craftsmen, and religious luminaries, becoming a true cultural and political capital. Bringing this extraor- dinary history marvelously to life, Judith Herrin rewrites the history of East and West in the Mediterranean world before the rise of Islam and shows how, thanks to Byzantine influence, Ravenna played a crucial role in the development of medieval Christendom. Drawing on deep, original research, Herrin tells the personal stories of Ravenna while setting them in a sweeping synthesis of Mediterranean and Christian history. From the Empress Galla Placidia and Theoderic the Gothic king, who both experienced being taken as hostages, to the amazing cosmographer of Ravenna and the doctor who strengthened expert Greek medical knowledge in Italy, Herrin demolishes the idea that the West just descended into the medieval \"Dark Ages.\" Beautifully illustrated and drawing on the latest archaeological findings, this monumental book provides a bold new interpretation of Ravenna's lasting influence on the culture of Europe and the West.

Yet, even beyond the question of slavery, inequality was built into the system because federalism by its very nature meant that many aspects of an American's life depended on where they lived. Over time, these inequalities have created vast divisions between the states and made federalism fundamentally unstable. In The Divided States of America , Donald Kettl chronicles the history of a political system that once united the nation\u2014and now threatens to break it apart. Exploring the full sweep of federalism from the founding to today, Kettl focuses on pivotal moments when power has shifted between state and national governments\u2014from the violent rebalanc- ing of the Civil War, when the nation almost split in two, to the era of civil rights a century later, when there was apparent agreement that inequality was a threat to liberty and the federal government should set policies for states to enact. Despite this consensus, inequality between states has only deepened since that moment. From health care and infrastructure to education and the environment, the quality of public services is ever more uneven. Having revealed the short- comings of Madison's marvel, Kettl points to possible solutions in the writings of another founder: Alexander Hamilton. Making an urgent case for reforming federalism, The Divided States of America shows why we must\u2014and how we can\u2014address the crisis of American inequality. Donald F.

Yet everywhere except Tunisia it led to either renewed dictatorship, civil war, extremist terror, or all three. In The Arab Winter , Noah Feldman argues that the Arab Spring was nevertheless not an unmitigated failure, much less an inevitable one. Rather, it was a noble, tragic series of events in which, for the first time in recent Middle Eastern history, Arabic- speaking peoples took free, collective political action as they sought to achieve self-determination. Focusing on the Egyptian revolution and counterrevolution, the Syrian civil war, the rise and fall of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and the Tunisian struggle toward Islamic constitutionalism, Feldman provides an original account of the political consequences of the Arab Spring, including the reaffirmation of pan-Arab identity, the dev- astation of Arab nationalisms, and the death of political Islam with the collapse of ISIS. He also challenges commentators who say that the Arab Spring was never truly transformative, that Arab popular self-determination was a mirage, and even that Arabs or Muslims are less capable of democracy than other peoples. Above all, The Arab Winter shows that we must not let the tragic outcome of the Arab Spring disguise its inherent human worth. People whose political lives had been determined from the outside tried, and for a time succeeded, in making politics for themselves. That this did not result in constitutional democracy or a better life for most of those affected doesn't mean the effort didn't matter. To the contrary, it matters for history\u2014and it matters for the future.

Tyranny returned in Egypt, horrendous slaughter followed the uprising in Syria, but Tunisia demonstrated what political prudence could achieve: the emergence of democracy in the Arab world.

Justin Farrell spent five years in Teton County, Wyoming, the richest county in the United States, and a community where income inequal- ity is the worst in the nation. He conducted hundreds of in-depth interviews, gaining unprecedented access to tech CEOs, Wall Street financiers, oil magnates, and other prominent figures in business and politics. He also talked with the rural poor who live among the ultra-wealthy and often work for them. The result is a penetrating account of the far-reaching consequences of the massive accrual of wealth, and an eye-opening and sometimes troubling portrait of a changing American West where romanticizing rural poverty and conserving nature can be lucrative\u2014socially as well as financially. Weaving unforgettable storytelling with thought-provoking analysis, Billionaire Wilderness reveals how the ultra-wealthy are buying up the land and leveraging one of the most pristine ecosys- tems in the world to climb even higher on the socioeconomic ladder. The affluent of Teton County are people burdened by stigmas, guilt, and status anxiety\u2014and they appropriate nature and rural people to create more virtuous and deserving versions of themselves. Incisive and compelling, Billionaire Wilderness reveals the hidden connections between wealth concentration and the environment, two of the most pressing and contentious issues of our time.

Offering a fresh and stimulating analysis of populism, Sandbu constructs a broad, well- evidenced case that it has economic causes. Fluent and clear, with a new and elegant argument, this book is well-tailored to a global audience.\" \u2014Stian Westlake, coauthor of Capitalism without CapitalThe Economics of Belonging MARTIN SANDBU Fueled by populism and the frustrations of the disenfranchised, the past few years have witnessed the widespread rejection of the eco- nomic and political order that Western countries built up after 1945. Political debates have turned into violent clashes between those who want to \"take their country back\" and those viewed as defending an elitist, broken, and unpatriotic social contract. There seems to be an increasing polarization of values. The Economics of Belonging argues that we should step back and take a fresh look at the root causes of our current challenges. In this original, engaging book, Martin Sandbu argues that economics remains at the heart of our widening inequality and it is only by focusing on the right policies that we can address it. He proposes a detailed, radical plan for creating a just economy where everyone can belong. Sandbu demonstrates that the rising numbers of the left behind are not due to globalization gone too far. Rather, technological change and flawed but avoidable domestic policies have eroded the founda- tions of an economy in which everyone can participate\u2014and would have done so even with a much less globalized economy. Sandbu contends that we have to double down on economic openness while pursuing dramatic reforms involving productivity, regional develop- ment, support for small- and medium-sized businesses, and increased worker representation. He discusses how a more active macroeco- nomic policy, education for all, universal basic income, and better taxation of capital could work together for society's benefit. Offering real answers, not invective, for facing our most seri- ous political issues, The Economics of Belonging shows how a better economic system can work for all.

Do we shape the buildings we live in, or are we formed by the places we call home? And why are we especially fascinated by the houses of the famous and often long-dead? In Lives of Houses , a group of notable biographers, historians, critics, and poets explores these questions and more through fascinating essays on the houses of great writers, artists, composers, and politicians of the past. Editors Kate Kennedy and Hermione Lee are joined by wide-ranging contributors, including Simon Armitage, Julian Barnes, David Cannadine, Roy Foster, Alexandra Harris, Daisy Hay, Margaret MacMillan, Alexander Masters, and Jenny Uglow. We encounter W. H. Auden, living in joyful squalor in New York's St. Mark's Place, and W. B. Yeats in his flood-prone tower in the windswept West of Ireland. We meet Benjamin Disraeli, struggling to keep up appear- ances, and track the lost houses of Virginia Woolf and Elizabeth Bowen. We visit Benjamin Britten in Aldeburgh, England, and Jean Sibelius at Ainola, Finland. But Lives of Houses also considers those who are unhoused, unwilling or unable to establish a home\u2014from the bewildered poet John Clare wandering the byways of England to the exiled Zimbabwean writer Dambudzo Marechera living on the streets of London.

Tolkien to create his fictional locations in The Lord of the Rings , The Hobbit , and other classic works. Written by renowned Tolkien expert John Garth and prepared with the full cooperation of the Tolkien estate, Tolkien's Worlds features a wealth of breathtaking illustrations, including Tolkien's own drawings, contributions from other artists, rare archival images, and spectacular color photos of contemporary locations across Britain and beyond, from the battlefields of World War I to Africa. Garth identifies the locales that served as the basis for Hobbiton, the Elven valley of Rivendell, the Glittering Caves of Helm's Deep, and many other settings in Middle-earth, from mountains and forests to rivers, lakes, and shorelands. He reveals the rich interplay between Tolkien's personal travels, his wide reading, and his deep scholarship as an Oxford don. Garth draws on his profound knowl- edge of Tolkien's life and work to shed light on the extraordinary processes of invention behind Tolkien's works of fantasy. He also debunks popular misconceptions about the inspirations for Middle- earth and puts forward strong new claims of his own. An illustrated journey into the life and imagination of one of the world's best-loved authors, Tolkien's Worlds provides a unique exploration of the relationship between the real and the fantastical and is an essential companion for anyone who wants to follow in Tolkien's footsteps.

A learned delight.\" \u2014Steven Shapin, coauthor of the Experimental LifeA finely drawn portrait of Einstein's sixteen months in PragueEinstein in Bohemia MICHAEL D. GORDIN In the spring of 1911, Albert Einstein moved with his wife and two sons to Prague, the capital of Bohemia, where he accepted a post as a professor of theoretical physics. Though he intended to make Prague his home, he lived there for just sixteen months, an interlude that his biographies typically dismiss as a brief and inconsequential episode. Einstein in Bohemia is a spellbinding portrait of the city that touched Einstein's life in unexpected ways\u2014and of the gifted young scientist who left his mark on the science, literature, and politics of Prague. Michael Gordin's narrative is a masterfully crafted account of a person encountering a particular place at a specific moment in time. Despite being heir to almost a millennium of history, Einstein's Prague was a relatively marginal city within the sprawling Austro- Hungarian Empire. Yet Prague, its history, and its multifaceted culture changed the trajectories of Einstein's personal and scientific life. It was here that his marriage unraveled, where he first began thinking seriously about his Jewish identity, and where he embarked on the project of general relativity. Prague was also where he formed lasting friendships with novelist Max Brod, Zionist intellectual Hugo Bergmann, physicist Philipp Frank, and other important figures. Einstein in Bohemia sheds light on this transformative period of Einstein's life and career, and brings vividly to life a beguiling city in the last years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Michael D.

Written by one of the world's leading experimental cosmologists, this short but deeply insightful book describes what scientists are revealing through pre- cise measurements of the faint thermal afterglow of the big bang\u2014 known as the cosmic microwave background, or CMB\u2014and how their findings are transforming our view of the cosmos. Blending the latest findings in cosmology with essential concepts from physics, Lyman Page first helps readers to grasp the sheer enormity of the universe, explaining how to understand the history of its formation and evolution in space and time. Then he sheds light on how spatial variations in the CMB formed, how they reveal the age, size, and geometry of the universe, and how they offer a blueprint for the formation of cosmic structure. Not only does Page explain current observations and measure- ments, he describes how they can be woven together into a unified picture to form the Standard Model of Cosmology. Yet much remains unknown, and this incisive book also describes the search for ever deeper knowledge at the field's frontiers\u2014from quests to understand the nature of neutrinos and dark energy to investigations into the physics of the very early universe.

Rosen offers impactful insights about the lives of Section 8 voucher holders and the private and public systems that shape their lives.\" \u2014Japonica Brown-Saracino, author of How Places Make UsAn in-depth look at America's largest rental assistance program and how it shapes the lives of residents in one low-income Baltimore neighborhoodThe Voucher Promise \"Section 8\" and the Fate of an American Neighborhood EVA ROSEN Housing vouchers are a cornerstone of US federal housing policy, offering aid to more than two million households. Vouchers are meant to provide the poor with increased choice in the private rental marketplace, enabling access to safe neighborhoods with good schools and higher-paying jobs. But do they? The Voucher Promise examines the Housing Choice Voucher Program, colloquially known as \"Section 8,\" and how it shapes the lives of families living in a Baltimore neighborhood called Park Heights. Eva Rosen tells stories about the daily lives of homeowners, voucher holders, renters who receive no housing assistance, and the landlords who provide housing. While vouchers are a powerful tool with great promise, she demonstrates how the housing policy can replicate the very inequalities it has the power to solve. Rosen spent more than a year living in Park Heights, sitting on front stoops, getting to know families, accompanying them on housing searches, speaking to landlords, and learning about the neighborhood's history. Voucher holders disproportionately end up in this area despite rampant unemployment, drugs, crime, and abandoned housing. Exploring why they are unable to relocate to other neighborhoods, Rosen illustrates the challenges in obtaining vouchers and the difficulties faced by recipients in using them when and where they want to. Yet, despite the program's real shortcom- ings, she argues that vouchers offer basic stability for families and should remain integral to solutions for the nation's housing crisis. Delving into the connections between safe, affordable housing and social mobility, The Voucher Promise investigates the profound benefits and formidable obstacles involved in housing America's poor.

Responding to global competition and pressure from financial markets, companies are asking employees to do more with less, even as new technologies normalize 24/7 job expectations. In Overload , Erin Kelly and Phyllis Moen document how this new intensification of work creates chronic stress, leading to burnout, attrition, and underperformance. \"Flexible\" work policies and corpo- rate lip service about \"work-life balance\" don't come close to fixing the problem. But this unhealthy and unsustainable situation can be changed\u2014and Overload shows how. Drawing on five years of research, including hundreds of interviews with employees and managers, Kelly and Moen tell the story of a major experiment that they helped design and implement at a Fortune 500 firm. The company adopted creative and practical work redesigns that gave workers more control over how and where they worked and encouraged managers to evaluate performance in new ways. The result? Employees' health, well-being, and ability to manage their personal and work lives improved, while the company benefited from higher job satisfaction and lower turnover. And, as Kelly and Moen show, such changes can\u2014and should\u2014be made on a wide scale.

CLINE In 1925, James Henry Breasted, famed Egyptologist and director of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, sent a team of archaeologists to the Holy Land to excavate the ancient site of Megiddo\u2014Armageddon in the New Testament\u2014which the Bible says was fortified by King Solomon. Their excavations made head- lines around the world and shed light on one of the most legendary cities of biblical times, yet little has been written about what hap- pened behind the scenes. Digging Up Armageddon brings to life one of the most important archaeological expeditions ever undertaken, describing the site and what was found there, including discoveries of gold and ivory, and providing an up-close look at the internal work- ings of a dig in the early years of biblical archaeology. The Chicago team left behind a trove of writings and corre- spondence spanning more than three decades, from letters and cablegrams to cards, notes, and diaries. Eric Cline draws on these materials to paint a compelling portrait of a bygone age of archae- ology. He masterfully sets the expedition against the backdrop of the Great Depression in America and the growing troubles and tensions in British Mandate Palestine. He gives readers an insider's perspective on the debates over what was uncovered at Megiddo, the infighting that roiled the expedition, and the stunning discoveries that transformed our understanding of the ancient world. Digging Up Armageddon is the enthralling story of an archae- ological site in the interwar years and its remarkable place at the crossroads of history. Eric H.

But that insight is hardly new. Nearly 2,000 years ago, Suetonius wrote Lives of the Caesars , per- haps the greatest negative leadership book of all time. He was ideally suited to write about terrible political leaders; after all, he was also the author of Famous Prostitutes and Words of Insult , both sadly lost. In How to Be a Bad Emperor , Josiah Osgood provides crisp new translations of Suetonius's briskly paced, darkly comic biographies of the Roman emperors Julius Caesar, Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero. Entertaining and shocking, the stories of these ancient anti-role models show how power inflames leaders' worst tendencies, causing almost incalculable damage. In a world bristling with strongmen eager to cast themselves as the Caesars of our day, How to Be a Bad Emperor is a delightfully enlightening guide to the dangers of power without character. Josiah Osgood is professor and chair of classics at Georgetown University and the author of many books.

Can drinking ever be a virtue? The Renaissance humanist and neoclassi- cal poet Vincent Obsopoeus (ca. 1498-1539) thought so. In the winelands of sixteenth-century Germany, he witnessed the birth of a poisonous new culture of bingeing, hazing, peer pressure, and competitive drinking. Alarmed, and inspired by the Roman poet Ovid's Art of Love , he wrote The Art of Drinking (De Arte Bibendi ) (1536), a how-to manual for drinking with pleasure and discrimination. In How to Drink , Michael Fontaine offers the first proper English translation of Obsopoeus's text, rendering his poetry into spirited, contemporary prose and uncorking a forgotten classic that will appeal to drinkers of all kinds and (legal) ages.

The Music of Time is a unique history of twentieth-century poetry by one of today's most acclaimed poets, blending incandes- cent personal meditations with rare insights about a broad range of poets who distilled the essence of the moment, gave voice to our griefs and joys, and shaped our collective memory. Bringing together poets from times and places as diverse as Tsarist Russia, 1960s Harlem, and Ireland at the height of the Troubles, Burnside reveals how poetry responded to the dramatic events of the century while shaping our impressions of them. He takes readers from the trenches of World War I to a prison cell in Nazi Germany, and from Rilke's grave in the Swiss Alps to Dylan Thomas's Welsh seaside. His luminous narrative is woven through with insights into the poet's creative process as well as lyrical and thought-provoking digressions on topics ranging from marriage to the Kennedy assassination. A spellbinding work of literary history, The Music of Time reveals how poets engaged with the most important issues and events of the twentieth century, and bears personal witness to the beauty and power of an art form unlike any other. John Burnside is a poet, novelist, and memoirist whose many books include Still Life with Feeding Snake and On Henry Miller (Princeton). He has won many awards for his poetry, including the T. S.

No other poet that I know of has at- tempted to reenvision Callimachus in modern dress. With an urbane wit and a sense of fun, enlivened with sensibil- ities from our own time, Burt's reimag- ined re-creations of Callimachus have a wonderful freshness about them.\" \u2014Stephen Scully, Boston UniversityContemporary translations and adaptations of ancient Greek poet Callimachus by noted writer and critic Stephanie BurtAfter Callimachus Poems STEPHANIE BURT Foreword by Mark Payne Callimachus may be the best-kept secret in all of ancient poetry. Loved and admired by later Romans and Greeks, his funny, sexy, generous, thoughtful, learned, sometimes elaborate, and always articulate lyric poems, hymns, epigrams, and short stories in verse have gone without a contemporary poetic champion, until now. In After Callimachus , esteemed poet and critic Stephanie Burt's atten- tive translations and inspired adaptations introduce the work, spirit, and letter of Callimachus to today's poetry readers. Skillfully combining intricate patterns of sound and classi- cal precedent with the very modern concerns of sex, gender, love, death, and technology, these poems speak with a twenty-first century voice, while also opening multiple gateways to ancient worlds. This Callimachus travels the Mediterranean, pays homage to Athena and Zeus, develops erotic fixations, practices funerary commemoration, and brings fresh gifts for the cult of Artemis. This reimagined poet also visits airports, uses Tumblr and Twitter, listens to pop music, and fights contemporary patriarchy. Burt bears careful fealty to Callimachus's whole poems, even as she builds freely from some of the hundreds of surviving fragments. Here is an ancient Greek poet made fresh for our times. An informative foreword by classicist Mark Payne places Burt's renderings of Callimachus in literary and historical context. After Callimachus is at once a contribution to contemporary poetry and a new endeavor in the art of classical adaptation and translation. Stephanie Burt is a poet and critic and professor of English at Harvard University. Her books include Don't Read Poetry , Advice from the Lights: Poems , and the essay collection Close Calls with Nonsense , which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.

Here, she shows us not a staid or fixed text, but a text patinaed with wine, a book that both comforts and unsettles, that remembers and interprets and challenges. Ochs has done the remarkable: she has written a book about the Haggadah that is as delightful as the Haggadah itself.\" \u2014Lauren F. Winner, Duke Divinity SchoolThe life and times of a treasured book read by generations of Jewish families at the seder table The Passover Haggadah A Biography VANESSA L. OCHS Every year at Passover, Jews around the world gather for the seder, a festive meal where family and friends come together to sing, pray, and enjoy traditional food while retelling the biblical story of the Exodus. The Passover Haggadah provides the script for the meal and is a religious text unlike any other. It is the only sacred book available in so many varieties\u2014from the Maxwell House edition of the 1930s to the countercultural Freedom Seder \u2014and it is the rare liturgical work that allows people with limited knowledge to conduct a com- plex religious service. The Haggadah is also the only religious book given away for free at grocery stores as a promotion. Vanessa Ochs tells the story of this beloved book, from its emergence in antiquity as an oral practice to its vibrant proliferation today. Ochs provides a lively and incisive account of how the founda- tional Jewish narrative of liberation is remembered in the Haggadah. She discusses the book's origins in biblical and rabbinical literature, its flourishing in illuminated manuscripts in the medieval period, and its mass production with the advent of the printing press. She looks at Haggadot created on the kibbutz, those reflecting the Holocaust, feminist and LGBTQ-themed Haggadot, and even one featuring a popular television show, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel . Ochs shows how this enduring work of liturgy that once served to transmit Jewish identity in Jewish settings continues to be reinterpreted and reimagined to share the message of freedom for all.

So began a schism that is nearly as old as Islam itself. Laurence Lou\u00ebr tells the story of this ancient rivalry, taking readers from the last days of Muhammad to the politi- cal and doctrinal clashes of Sunnis and Shi'a today. In a sweeping historical narrative spanning the Islamic world, Lou\u00ebr shows how the Sunni-Shi'a divide was never just a dispute over succession\u2014at issue are questions about the very nature of Islamic political authority. She challenges the widespread perception of Sunnis and Shi'a as bitter enemies who are perpetually at war with each other, demonstrating how they have coexisted peacefully at various periods throughout the history of Islam. Lou\u00ebr traces how sectarian tensions have been inflamed or calmed depending on the political contingencies of the moment, whether to consolidate the rule of elites, assert clerical control over the state, or defy the powers that be. Timely and provocative, Sunnis and Shi'a provides needed perspective on the historical roots of today's conflicts and reveals how both branches of Islam have influenced and emulated each other in unexpected ways. This compelling and accessible book also examines the diverse regional contexts of the Sunni-Shi'a divide, examining how it has shaped societies and politics in countries such as Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Yemen, and Lebanon.

Daniel Gillion's highly original book could not be more relevant to American politics today.\" \u2014Robert Y. Shapiro, Columbia UniversityHow political protests and activism have a direct influence on voter and candidate behaviorThe Loud Minority Why Protests Matter in American Democracy DANIEL Q. GILLION The \"silent majority\"\u2014a phrase coined by Richard Nixon in 1969 in response to Vietnam War protests and later used by Donald Trump as a campaign slogan\u2014refers to the supposed wedge that exists between protestors in the street and the voters at home. The Loud Minority upends this view by demonstrating that voters are in fact directly informed and influenced by protest activism. Consequently, as protests grow in America, every facet of the electoral process is touched by this loud minority, benefiting the political party perceived to be the most supportive of the protestors' messaging. Drawing on historical evidence, statistical data, and detailed interviews about protest activity since the 1960s, Daniel Gillion shows that electoral districts with protest activity are more likely to see increased voter turnout at the polls. Surprisingly, protest activities are also moneymaking endeavors for electoral politics, as voters donate more to political candidates who share the ideological leanings of activists. Finally, protests are a signal of political prob- lems, encouraging experienced political challengers to run for office and hurting incumbents' chances of winning reelection. The silent majority may not speak by protesting themselves, but they clearly gesture for social change with their votes. An exploration of how protests affect voter behavior and warn of future electoral changes, The Loud Minority looks at the many ways that activism can shape democracy. Daniel Q.

Engage them in the work of enhancing the democratic power of regular citi- zens everywhere. This is a great book.\" \u2014Joe Mathews, copresident of the Global Forum on Modern Direct DemocracyHow referendums can diffuse populist tensions by putting power back into the hands of the peopleLet the People Rule How Direct Democracy Can Meet the Populist Challenge JOHN G. MATSUSAKA Propelled by the belief that government has slipped out of the hands of ordinary citizens, a surging wave of populism is destabilizing democracies around the world. As John Matsusaka reveals in Let the People Rule, this belief is based in fact. Over the past century, while democratic governments have become more efficient, they have also become more disconnected from the people they purport to repre- sent. The solution Matsusaka advances is familiar but surprisingly underused: direct democracy, in the form of referendums. While this might seem like a dangerous idea post-Brexit, there is a great deal of evidence that, with careful design and thoughtful implementation, referendums can help bridge the growing gulf between the govern- ment and the people. Drawing on examples from around the world, Matsusaka shows how direct democracy can bring policies back in line with the will of the people (and provide other benefits, like curbing cor- ruption). Taking lessons from failed processes like Brexit, he also describes what issues are best suited to referendums and how they should be designed, and he tackles questions that have long vexed direct democracy: can voters be trusted to choose reasonable poli - cies, and can minority rights survive majority decisions? The result is one of the most comprehensive examinations of direct democracy to date\u2014coupled with concrete, nonpartisan proposals for how coun- tries can make the most of the powerful tools that referendums offer. With a crisis of representation hobbling democracies across the globe, Let the People Rule offers important new ideas about the crucial role the referendum can play in the future of government.

DAVID VELLEMAN Illustrated by Emily C. Bernstein We've all had to puzzle over such profound matters as birth, death, regret, free will, agency, and love. How might philosophy help us think through these vital concerns? In On Being Me , renowned moral philosopher J. David Velleman presents a concise, accessible, and intimate exploration into subjects that we care deeply about, offering compelling insights into what it means to be human. Each of Velleman's short, personal chapters begins with a theme: \"Being Glad I Was Born,\" \"Wanting to Happen,\" and \"Wanting to Be Loved.\" Reflecting on how daily life presents us with thorny riddles that need working out, Velleman arrives at unexpected conclusions about survival and per- sonal identity, the self and its future, time and morality, the rational- ity of regret, free will and personal efficacy, and goodness and love. He shows that we can rely on our own powers of thought to arrive at a better understanding of the most fundamental parts of ourselves\u2014 and that the methods of philosophy can help get us there.

In fourteen brief, lively chapters that draw from Shakespeare's world and works, and from other writers past and present, Scott Newstok distills vital habits of mind that can help you think more deeply, write more effectively, and learn more joyfully, in school or beyond. Challenging a host of today's questionable notions about education, Newstok shows how mental play emerges through work, creativity through imitation, autonomy through tradition, innovation through constraint, and freedom through discipline. It was these practices, and a conversation with the past\u2014not a fruitless obses- sion with assessment\u2014that nurtured a mind like Shakespeare's. And while few of us can hope to approach the genius of the Bard, we can all learn from the exercises that shaped him.

While many forms of leisure meet these needs, Zena Hitz writes, few experiences are so fulfilling as the inner life, whether that of a bookworm, an amateur astronomer, a birdwatcher, or some- one who takes a deep interest in one of countless other subjects. Drawing on inspiring examples, from Socrates and Augustine to Malcolm X and Elena Ferrante, and from films to Hitz's own experiences as someone who walked away from elite university life in search of greater fulfillment, Lost in Thought is a passionate and timely reminder that a rich life is a life rich in thought. Today, when even the humanities are often defended only for their economic or political usefulness, Hitz says our intellectual lives are valuable not despite but because of their practical uselessness. And while anyone can have an intellectual life, she encourages aca- demics in particular to get back in touch with the desire to learn for its own sake, and calls on universities to return to the person-to- person transmission of the habits of mind and heart that bring out the best in us. Reminding us of who we once were and who we might become, Lost in Thought is a moving account of why renewing our inner lives is fundamental to preserving our humanity.

While this book provides a valu- able guide to traditional discussions about the soul, together with a careful assessment of modern scientific understandings, it especially resonates with our wish to make sense of life and our desire to reach out beyond ourselves to some ideal of goodness.\" \u2014Richard Harries, King's College LondonHow our beliefs about the soul have developed through the ages, and why an understanding of it still matters today In Search of the Soul A Philosophical Essay JOHN COTTINGHAM The concept of the soul has been a recurring area of exploration since ancient times. What do we mean when we talk about finding our soul, how do we know we have one, and does it hold any rele- vance in today's scientifically and technologically dominated society? From Socrates and Augustine to Darwin and Freud, In Search of the Soul takes readers on a concise, accessible journey into the origins of the soul in Western philosophy and culture, and examines how the idea has developed throughout history to the present. Touching on literature, music, art, and theology, John Cottingham illustrates how, far from being redundant in contemporary times, the soul attunes us to the importance of meaning and value, and experience and growth. A better understanding of the soul might help all of us better under- stand what it is to be human. Cottingham delves into the evolution of our thoughts about the soul through landmark works\u2014including those of Aristotle, Plato, and Descartes. He considers the nature of consciousness and subjective experience, and discusses the psychoanalytic view that large parts of the human psyche are hidden from direct conscious awareness. He also reflects on the mysterious and universal longing for transcendence that is an indelible part of our human makeup. Looking at the soul's many dimensions\u2014historical, moral, psycho- logical, and spiritual\u2014Cottingham makes a case for how it exerts a powerful pull on all of us. In Search of the Soul is a testimony to how the soul remains a profoundly significant aspect of human flourishing.

Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia was a talented and ambitious teacher who possessed a secret formula\u2014the key to unlocking a seemingly unsolvable, two- thousand-year-old mathematical problem. He wrote it down in the form of a poem to prevent other mathematicians from stealing it. Gerolamo Cardano was a physician, gifted scholar, and notorious gambler who would not hesitate to use flattery and even trickery to learn Tartaglia's secret. Set against the backdrop of sixteenth-century Italy, The Secret Formula provides new and compelling insights into the peculiarities of Renaissance mathematics while bringing a turbulent and culturally vibrant age to life. It was an era when mathematicians challenged each other in intellectual duels held outdoors before enthusiastic crowds. Success not only enhanced the winner's reputation, but could result in prize money and professional acclaim. After hear- ing of Tartaglia's spectacular victory in one such contest in Venice, Cardano invited him to Milan, determined to obtain his secret by whatever means necessary. Cardano's intrigues paid off. In 1545, he was the first to publish a general solution of the cubic equation. Tartaglia, eager to take his revenge by establishing his superiority as the most brilliant mathematician of the age, challenged Cardano to the ultimate mathematical duel. A lively and compelling account of genius, betrayal, and all-too- human failings, The Secret Formula reveals the epic rivalry behind one of the fundamental ideas of modern algebra.

NAHIN Heat, like gravity, shapes nearly every aspect of our world and universe, from how milk dissolves in coffee to how molten planets cool. The heat equation, a cornerstone of modern physics, demysti- fies such processes, painting a mathematical picture of the way heat diffuses through matter. Presenting the mathematics and history behind the heat equation, Hot Molecules, Cold Electrons tells the remarkable story of how this foundational idea brought about one of the greatest technological advancements of the modern era. Paul Nahin vividly recounts the heat equation's tremendous influence on society, showing how French mathematical physicist Joseph Fourier discovered, derived, and solved the equation in the early nineteenth century. Nahin then follows Scottish physicist William Thomson, whose further analysis of Fourier's explorations led to the pioneering trans-Atlantic telegraph cable. This feat of engineering reduced the time it took to send a message across the ocean from weeks to minutes. Readers also learn that Thomson used Fourier's solutions to calculate the age of the earth, and, in a bit of colorful lore, that writer Charles Dickens relied on the trans-Atlantic cable to save himself from a career-damaging scandal. The book's mathematical and scientific explorations can be easily understood by anyone with a basic knowledge of high school calculus and physics, and MATLAB code is included to aid readers who would like to solve the heat equation themselves. A testament to the intricate links between mathematics and physics, Hot Molecules, Cold Electrons offers a fascinating glimpse into the relationship between a formative equation and one of the most important developments in the history of human communication.

Cain, coeditor of The Norton Anthology of Theory and CriticismThe remarkable transformation of Orwell from journeyman writer to towering icon REANNOUNCING Becoming George Orwell Life and Letters, Legend and Legacy JOHN RODDEN Is George Orwell the most influential writer who ever lived? Yes, according to John Rodden's provocative book about the transfor- mation of a man into a myth. Rodden does not argue that Orwell was the most distinguished man of letters of the last century, nor even the leading novelist of his generation, let alone the greatest imaginative writer of English prose fiction. Yet his influence since his death at midcentury is incomparable. No other writer has aroused so much controversy or contributed so many incessantly quoted words and phrases to our cultural lexicon, from \"Big Brother\" and \"doublethink\" to \"thoughtcrime\" and \"Newspeak.\" Becoming George Orwell is a pathbreaking tour de force that charts the astonishing passage of a litterateur into a legend. Rodden presents the author of Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four in a new light, exploring how the man and writer Orwell, born Eric Arthur Blair, came to be overshadowed by the spectral figure associated with nightmare visions of our possible futures. Rodden opens with a discussion of the life and letters, chronicling Orwell's eccentricities and emotional struggles, followed by an assessment of his chief literary achievements. The second half of the book examines the legend and legacy of Orwell, whom Rodden calls \"England's Prose Laureate,\" looking at everything from cyberwarfare to \"fake news.\" The closing chapters address both Orwell's enduring relevance to burning contemporary issues and the multiple ironies of his popular reputation, showing how he and his work have become confused with the very dreads and diseases that he fought against throughout his life.

Starting in Germany with Romanticism and ending with international contemporary art, she traces the development of the visual arts as an expression of the scientific worldview in which humankind is part of a natural web of dynamic forces without predetermined purpose or meaning. Gamwell reveals how artists give nature meaning by portraying it as mysterious, dangerous, or beautiful. With a foreword by Neil deGrasse Tyson and a wealth of stun- ning images, this expanded edition of Exploring the Invisible draws on the latest scholarship to provide a global perspective on the sci- entists and artists who explore life on Earth, human consciousness, and the space-time universe. Lynn Gamwell is a lecturer in the history of art, science, and mathe- matics at the School of Visual Arts in New York. She is the author of Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History (Princeton).

ART | SCIENCE Art & Architecture 43The enduring influence of naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt on American art, culture, and politics Alexander von Humboldt and the United States Art, Nature, and Culture ELEANOR JONES HARVEY Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) was one of the most influen- tial scientists and thinkers of his age. A Prussian-born geographer, naturalist, explorer, and illustrator, he was a prolific writer whose books graced the shelves of American artists, scientists, philoso- phers, and politicians. Humboldt visited the United States for six weeks in 1804, engaging in a lively exchange of ideas with such figures as Thomas Jefferson and the painter Charles Willson Peale. It was perhaps the most consequential visit by a European traveler in the young nation's history, one that helped to shape an emerging American identity grounded in the natural world. In this beautifully illustrated book, Eleanor Jones Harvey examines how Humboldt left a lasting impression on American visual arts, sciences, literature, and politics. She shows how he inspired a network of like-minded individuals who would go on to embrace the spirit of exploration, decry slavery, advocate for the welfare of Native Americans, and extol America's wilderness as a signature component of the nation's sense of self. Harvey traces how Humboldt's ideas influenced the transcendentalists and the landscape painters of the Hudson River School, and laid the foundations for the Smithsonian Institution, the Sierra Club, and the National Park Service. Alexander von Humboldt and the United States looks at paint- ings, sculptures, maps, and artifacts, and features works by leading American artists such as Albert Bierstadt, George Catlin, Frederic Church, and Samuel F. B. Morse. Eleanor Jones Harvey is senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. She is the author of The Civil War and American Art , The Voyage of the Icebergs: Frederic Church's Arctic Masterpiece , and The Painted Sketch: American Impressions from Nature, 1830-1880 .

Here for the first time in English is a study by one of the most admired art historians of the twentieth century on one of the central figures of the Western tradition.\" \u2014Michael W. Cole, author of Ambitious Form: Giambologna, Ammanati, and Danti in FlorenceThe first English edition of Erwin Panofsky's long-lost work on MichelangeloMichelangelo's Design Principles Particularly in Relation to Those of Raphael ERWIN PANOFSKY Edited and with an introduction by Gerda Panofsky In 2012, a manuscript by renowned art historian Erwin Panofsky was rediscovered in a safe in Munich, in the basement of what is now the Central Institute for Art History. Hidden for decades among folders and administrative files was Panofsky's thesis on Michelangelo\u2014 submitted to Hamburg University in 1920, abandoned when Panofsky fled Hitler's Germany in 1933, and thought to have been destroyed in the Allied bombings. Michelangelo's Design Principles makes this remarkable work available for the first time in English, a century after the original version was written. Casting Panofsky's thought in an entirely new light, Michelangelo's Design Principles is the legendary scholar's only book- length examination of the art of the Italian Renaissance. He provides a compelling analysis of Michelangelo's artistic style and deftly com- pares it with that of Raphael, situating both Renaissance masters in the broader context of Western art. This illuminating book offers unique perspectives on Panofsky's early intellectual development and the state of research on Michelangelo and the High Renaissance at a period of transition in art history, when formalist readings of artworks began to take precedence over a biographical approach. Featuring an introduction by Gerda Panofsky that discusses the history of the original manuscript and the significance of its rediscovery, Michelangelo's Design Principles is a crucial link between Panofsky's formalist training as a young art historian and his later work in iconology. Erwin Panofsky (1892-1968) was one of the most eminent art historians of the twentieth century. His many books include Early Netherlandish Painting and The Life and Art of Albrecht D\u00fcrer (Princeton). Gerda Panofsky is professor emerita of art history at Temple University. She has published on Michelangelo and oversaw the second edition of Erwin Panofsky's Abbot Suger on the Abbey Church of St.-Denis and Its Art Treasures (Princeton).

ART Art & Architecture 45The first publication of the unknown poetry of a major twentieth-century sculptor Black Mountain Chamberlain John Chamberlain's Writings at Black Mountain College, 1955 EDITED BY JULIE SYLVESTER In 1955, long before he became famous for his abstract metal sculptures, John Chamberlain lived at Black Mountain College, writing poetry alongside Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan, and Charles Olson. By the time he moved to New York City in 1956 and began to develop his unique sculptural style, Chamberlain had completed a series of poems with marginal comments by Olson and himself, but the work remained unpublished and unknown\u2014until now. In Black Mountain Chamberlain , Julie Sylvester presents a facsimile of this fascinating typescript along with an introduction based on interviews conducted with Chamberlain in the 1980s, conversations in which he described the strong connections between the poems and his later work. At first glance, Chamberlain's delicate and quiet poems appear to be the antithesis of his bold and brash sculpture. But in the intro- duction Chamberlain says that in fact the way he made poems at Black Mountain influenced the way he made sculptures throughout his career: \"It's actually doing things in the same way, with words or with metal. It's all in the fit.\" Beautifully produced, Black Mountain Chamberlain reveals a remarkable and unexpected new side of an important twentieth- century artist. John Chamberlain (1927-2011) was an American sculptor whose works are featured in major museum collections around the world. Julie Sylvester is the author of John Chamberlain: A Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of the Sculpture, 1954-1985 , as well as books on Louise Bourgeois, Willem de Kooning, and Cy Twombly.

Lateness provokes a wide range of conversa- tions about Eisenman's own work, but also about the nature of architecture as a field and a discipline.\" \u2014Mark Jarzombek, author of Digital Stockholm Syndrome in the Post-Ontological AgeA provocative case for historical ambiguity in architecture by one of the field's leading theoristsLateness PETER EISENMAN With Elisa Iturbe With a preface by Sarah Whiting Conceptions of modernity in architecture are often expressed in the idea of the zeitgeist, or \"spirit of the age,\" an attitude toward architectural form that is embedded in a belief in progressive time. Lateness explores how architecture can work against these linear currents in startling and compelling ways. In this incisive book, internationally renowned architect Peter Eisenman, with Elisa Iturbe, proposes a different perspective on form and time in architecture, one that circumvents the temporal constraints on style that require it to be \"of the times\"\u2014lateness. He focuses on three twentieth- century architects who exhibited the qualities of lateness in their designs: Adolf Loos, Aldo Rossi, and John Hejduk. Drawing on the critical theory of Theodor Adorno and his study of Beethoven's final works, Eisenman shows how the architecture of these canonical fig- ures was temporally out of sync with conventions and expectations, and how lateness can serve as a form of release from the restraints of the moment. Bringing together architecture, music, and philosophy, and drawing on illuminating examples from the Renaissance and Baroque periods, Lateness demonstrates how today's architecture can use the concept of lateness to break free of stylistic limitations, expand archi- tecture's critical capacity, and provide a new mode of analysis. Peter Eisenman is founder and principal of Eisenman Architects and visiting professor at the Yale School of Architecture.

In this lavishly illustrated book, Diane Waggoner offers the first comprehensive account of Carroll as a photographer of modern childhood, exploring how his photographs of children gave visual form to emerging conceptions of childhood in the Victorian age. Situating Carroll's photography within the broader context of Victorian visual and social culture, Waggoner shows how he drew on images of childhood in painting and other media, and engaged with the visual language of the Victorian theater, fancy dress, and Pre- Raphaelitism. She provides the first in-depth analysis of Carroll's pho- tographing of boys, which she examines in the context of boys' edu- cation and reveals to be a significant part of his photographic career. Waggoner draws on a wealth of rare archival material, demonstrating how Carroll established new aesthetic norms for images of girls, engaged with evolving definitions of masculinity, and pushed the idea of childhood to the limit with his use of dress and nude images. This book sheds unique light on Carroll's decades-long passion for photography, showing how his complex and haunting images of children embody conflicting definitions of childhood and are no less powerful today in their ability to challenge, fascinate, and shock us. Diane Waggoner is curator of nineteenth-century photographs at the National Gallery of Art.

PHOTOGRAPHY | ART48 Art & Architecture \"Barber raises important issues regarding modern architecture and its relationship with climate control. This is a book that every architect, architectural historian, and interior designer should read.\" \u2014Fernando Luiz Lara, coauthor of Modern Architecture in Latin America: Art, Technology, and UtopiaHow climate influenced the design strategies of modernist architectsModern Architecture and Climate Design before Air Conditioning DANIEL A. BARBER Modern Architecture and Climate explores how leading architects of the twentieth century incorporated climate-mediating strategies into their designs, and shows how regional approaches to climate adaptability were essential to the development of modern archi- tecture. Focusing on the period surrounding World War II\u2014before fossil-fuel powered air-conditioning became widely available\u2014 Daniel Barber brings to light a vibrant and dynamic architectural discussion involving design, materials, and shading systems as means of interior climate control. He looks at projects by well-known architects such as Richard Neutra, Le Corbusier, L\u00facio Costa, Mies van der Rohe, and Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, and the work of climate-focused architects such as MMM Roberto, Olgyay and Olgyay, and Cliff May. Drawing on the editorial projects of James Marston Fitch, Elizabeth Gordon, and others, he demonstrates how images and diagrams produced by architects helped conceptualize climate knowledge, alongside the work of meteorologists, physicists, engineers, and social scientists. Barber describes how this novel type of environmental media catalyzed new ways of thinking about climate and architectural design. Extensively illustrated with archival material, Modern Architecture and Climate provides global perspectives on modern architecture and its evolving relationship with a changing climate, showcasing designs from Latin America, Europe, the United States, the Middle East, and Africa. This timely and important book recon- ciles the cultural dynamism of architecture with the material realities of ever-increasing carbon emissions from the mechanical cooling systems of buildings, and offers a historical foundation for today's zero-carbon design.

No other book comes close to synthesizing the importance of Sade's thought to the avant-gardes, and no other scholar before Mahon has explored why the Sadean imag- ination could be captivating, even liberating, for women.\" \u2014Katharine Conley, author of Surrealist GhostlinessHow the notorious author of The 120 Days of Sodom inspired the surrealists and other avant-garde artists, writers, and filmmakersThe Marquis de Sade and the Avant-Garde ALYCE MAHON The the Marquis de Sade (1740-1814) present a liber- tine philosophy of sexual excess and human suffering that refuses to make any concession to law, religion, or public decency. In this groundbreaking cultural history, Alyce Mahon traces how artists of the twentieth century turned to Sade to explore political, sexual, and psychological terror, adapting his imagery of the excessively sexual and terrorized body as a means of liberation from systems of power. Mahon shows how avant-garde artists, writers, dramatists, and filmmakers drew on Sade's \"philosophy in the bedroom\" to chal- lenge oppressive regimes and their restrictive codes and conventions of gender and sexuality. She provides close analyses of early illus- trated editions of Sade's works and looks at drawings, paintings, and photographs by leading surrealists such as Andr\u00e9 Masson, Leonor Fini, and Man Ray. She explains how Sade's ideas were reflected in the writings of Guillaume Apollinaire and the fiction of Anne Desclos, who wrote her erotic novel, Story of O , as a love letter to critic Jean Paulhan, an admirer of Sade. Mahon explores how Sade influenced the Happenings of Jean-Jacques Lebel, the theater of Peter Brook, the cinema of Pier Paolo Pasolini, and the multimedia art of Paul Chan. She also discusses responses to Sade by feminist theorists such as Simone de Beauvoir, Susan Sontag, and Angela Carter. Beautifully illustrated, The Marquis de Sade and the Avant- Garde demonstrates that Sade inspired generations of artists to imagine new utopian visions of living, push the boundaries of the body and the body politic, and portray the unthinkable in their art.

ART50 Art & ArchitectureAn in-depth and beautifully illustrated look at one of the most revered works of antiquity, the Ishtar Gate of ancient Babylon A Wonder to Behold Craftsmanship and the Creation of Babylon's Ishtar Gate EDITED BY ANASTASIA AMRHEIN, CLARE FITZGERALD & ELIZABETH KNOTT In the ancient Near East, expert craftspeople were more than technicians: they numbered among those special members of society who could access the divine. While the artisans' names are largely unknown today, their legacy remains in the form of spectacular artworks and monuments. One of the most cele- brated works antiquity\u2014Babylon's Ishtar Gate and its affili- ated Processional Way\u2014featured a dazzling array of colorful beasts assembled from molded, baked, and glazed bricks. Such an awe- inspiring structure demanded the highest level of craft; each animal was created from dozens of bricks that interlocked like a jigsaw. Yet this display of technical and artistic skill also served a ritual purpose, since the Gate provided a divinely protected entrance to the sacred inner city of Babylon. A Wonder to Behold explores ancient Near Eastern ideas about the transformative power of materials and craftsmanship as they relate to the Ishtar Gate.

It delves into the reasons why some species, such as the wattled jacana, rely on males to do all the childcare, while others, such as cuckoos and honeyguides, dump their eggs in the nests of others to raise. For some birds, reciprocal promiscuity pays off: both male and female dunnocks will rear the most chicks by mating with as many partners as possible. For others, long-term monogamy is the only way to ensure their offspring survive. The book explores the wide variety of ways birds make sure they find a mate in the first place, including how many male birds employ elaborate tactics to show how sexy they are. Gathering in leks to display to females, they dance, pose, or parade to sell their suitability as a mate. Other birds attract a partner with their build- ing skills: female bowerbirds rate brains above beauty, so males construct elaborate bowers with twig avenues and cleared courtyards to impress them. Looking at the differing levels of parenting skills across species around the world, we see why a tenth of bird species, including the fairy-wrens of Australia, have helpers at the nest who forgo their own reproduction to assist the breeding pair; how brood parasites and their hosts have engaged in evolutionary arms races; and how monoga- mous pairs share\u2014or relinquish\u2014their responsibilities. Illustrated throughout with beautiful photographs, Bird Love is a celebration of the global diversity of avian reproductive strategies.

Roberts offers broad insights into the ways the global war on terror has enabled authoritarian regimes around the world to repress minority populations.\" \u2014Michael E. Clarke, author of Xinjiang and China's Rise in Central Asia\u2014A HistoryHow China is using the US-led war on terror to erase the cultural identity of its Muslim minority in the Xinjiang regionThe War on the Uyghurs China's Internal Campaign against a Muslim Minority SEAN R. ROBERTS Within weeks of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, the Chinese government warned that it faced a serious terrorist threat from its Uyghur ethnic minority, who are largely Muslim. In this explosive book, Sean Roberts reveals how China has been using the US-led global war on terror as international cover for its increasingly brutal suppression of the Uyghurs, and how the war's targeting of an undefined enemy has emboldened states around the globe to persecute ethnic minorities and severely repress domestic opposition in the name of combatting terrorism. Of the eleven million Uyghurs living in China today, more than one million are now being held in so-called reeducation camps, victims of what has become the largest program of mass detention and sur- veillance in the world. Roberts describes how the Chinese government successfully implicated the Uyghurs in the global terror war\u2014despite a complete lack of evidence\u2014and branded them as a dangerous terrorist threat with links to al-Qaeda. He argues that the reframing of Uyghur domestic dissent as international terrorism provided justification and inspiration for a systematic campaign to erase Uyghur identity, and that a nominal Uyghur militant threat only emerged after more than a decade of Chinese suppression in the name of counterterrorism\u2014 which has served to justify further state repression. A gripping and moving account of the humanitarian catastro- phe that China does not want you to know about, The War on the Uyghurs draws on Roberts's own in-depth interviews with the Uyghurs, enabling their voices to be heard.

More works than ever circulate worldwide in English and in translation, and even national traditions are increasingly seen in transnational terms. To encompass this expanding literary universe, scholars and teachers need to expand their linguistic and cultural resources, rethink their methods and training, and reconceive the place of literature and criticism in the world. In Comparing the Literatures , David Damrosch integrates comparative, postcolonial, and world-literary perspectives to offer a comprehensive overview of comparative studies and its prospects in a time of great upheaval and great opportunity. Comparing the Literatures looks both at institutional forces and at key episodes in the life and work of comparatists who have strug- gled to define and redefine the terms of literary analysis over the past two centuries, from Johann Gottfried Herder and Germaine de Sta\u00ebl Spivak, Franco Moretti, and Emily Apter. With literary examples ranging from Ovid and Klidsa to James Joyce, Yoko Tawada, and the internet artists Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries, Damrosch shows how the main strands of compari- son\u2014philology, literary theory, colonial and postcolonial studies, and the study of world literature\u2014have long been intertwined. A deeper understanding of comparative literature's achievements, persistent contradictions, and even failures can help comparatists in literature and other fields develop creative responses to today's most import- ant questions and debates. Amid a multitude of challenges and new possibilities for com- parative literature, Comparing the Literatures provides an important roadmap for the discipline's revitalization. David Damrosch is the Ernest Bernbaum Professor and Chair of Comparative Literature and director of the Institute for World Literature at Harvard University, and a past president of the American Comparative Literature Association.

Building on a persuasive new argument about the causes behind democracy's emergence, and bringing together data and fascinating exam- ples, The Decline and Rise of Democ - racy makes a novel contribution to a range of social science fields.\" \u2014Philip T. Hoffman, California Institute of TechnologyA new understanding of how and why early democracy took hold, how modern democracy evolved, and what this teaches us about the futureThe Decline and Rise of Democracy A Global History from Antiquity to Today DAVID STASAVAGE Historical accounts of democracy's rise tend to focus on ancient Greece and pre-Renaissance Europe. The Decline and Rise of Democracy draws from global evidence to show that the story is much richer\u2014 democratic practices were present in many places, at many other times, from the Americas before European conquest, to ancient Mesopotamia, to precolonial Africa. Delving into the prevalence of early democracy throughout the world, David Stasavage makes the case that understanding how and where these democracies flourished\u2014and when and why they declined\u2014can provide crucial information not just about the history of governance, but about the ways modern democra- cies work and where they could manifest in the future. Drawing from examples spanning several millennia, Stasavage first considers why states developed either democratic or autocratic styles of governance and argues that early democracy tended to develop in small places with a weak state and, counterintuitively, simple technologies. When central state institutions (such as a tax bureaucracy) were absent\u2014as in medieval Europe\u2014rulers needed consent from their populace to govern. When central institutions were strong\u2014as in China or the Middle East\u2014consent was less necessary and autocracy more likely. He then explores the transition from early to modern democracy, which first took shape in England and then the United States, illustrating that modern democracy arose as an effort to combine popular control with a strong state over a large territory. Democracy has been an experiment that has unfolded over time and across the world\u2014and its transformation is ongoing.

Outsourcing Empire is a signal contribution to debates in historical international relations.\" \u2014George Lawson, London School of EconomicsHow chartered company-states spearheaded European expansion and helped create the world's first genuinely global order Outsourcing Empire How Company-States Made the Modern World ANDREW PHILLIPS & J. C. SHARMAN From Spanish conquistadors to British colonialists, the prevailing story of European empire-building has focused on the rival ambitions of competing states. But as Outsourcing Empires shows, from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries, company-states\u2014not sovereign states\u2014drove European expansion, building the world's first genuinely international system. Company-states were hybrid ventures: pioneer- ing multinational trading firms run for profit, with founding charters that granted them sovereign powers of war, peace, and rule. Those like the English and Dutch East India Companies carved out corporate empires in Asia, while other company-states pushed forward European expansion through North America, Africa, and the South Pacific. In this comparative exploration, Andrew Phillips and J. C. Sharman explain the rise and fall of company-states, why some succeeded while others failed, and their role as vanguards of capitalism and imperialism. In dealing with alien civilizations to the East and West, Europeans relied primarily on company-states to mediate geographic and cultural distances in trade and diplomacy. Emerging as impro- vised solutions to bridge the gap between European rulers' expan- sive geopolitical ambitions and their scarce means, company-states succeeded best where they could balance the twin imperatives of power and profit. Yet as European states strengthened from the late eighteenth century onward, and a sense of separate public and private spheres grew, the company-states lost their usefulness and legitimacy. Bringing a fresh understanding to the ways cross-cultural relations were handled across the oceans, Outsourcing Empire exam- ines the significance of company-states as key progenitors of the globalized world.

The Deportation Machine traces the long and troubling history of the US government's systematic efforts to terrorize and expel immigrants over the past 140 years. This provocative, eye-opening book provides needed historical perspective on one of the most pressing social and political issues of our time. In a sweeping and engaging narrative, Adam Goodman examines how federal, state, and local officials have targeted various groups for expulsion, from Chinese and Europeans at the turn of the twentieth century to Central Americans and Muslims today. He reveals how authorities have singled out Mexicans, nine out of ten of all deportees, and removed most of them not by orders of immi- gration judges but through coercive administrative procedures and calculated fear campaigns. Goodman uncovers the machine's three primary mechanisms\u2014formal deportations, \"voluntary\" departures, and self-deportations\u2014and examines how public officials have used them to purge immigrants from the country and exert control over those who remain. Exposing the pervasive roots of anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States, The Deportation Machine introduces the politicians, bureaucrats, businesspeople, and ordinary citizens who have pushed for and profited from expulsion. This revelatory book chronicles the devastating human costs of deportation and the innovative strategies people have adopted to fight against the machine and redefine belonging in ways that transcend citizenship.

Weaver, Johns Hopkins UniversityA groundbreaking look at how group expectations unify black Americans in their support of the Democratic party Steadfast Democrats How Social Forces Shape Black Political Behavior ISMAIL K. WHITE & CHRYL N. LAIRD Black Americans are by far the most unified racial group in American electoral politics, with 80 to 90 percent identifying as Democrats\u2014a surprising figure given that nearly a third now also identify as ideo- logically conservative, up from less than 10 percent in the 1970s. Why has ideological change failed to push more black Americans into the Republican Party? Steadfast Democrats answers this question with a pathbreaking new theory that foregrounds the specificity of the black American experience and illuminates social pressure as the key element of black Americans' unwavering support for the Democratic Party. Ismail White and Chryl Laird argue that the roots of black politi- cal unity were established through the adversities of slavery and segre- gation, when black Americans forged uniquely strong social bonds for survival and resistance. White and Laird explain how these tight com- munities have continued to produce and enforce political norms\u2014 including Democratic Party identification in the post-Civil Rights era. The social experience of race for black Americans is thus fundamental to their political choices. Black voters are uniquely influenced by the social expectations of other black Americans to prioritize the group's ongoing struggle for freedom and equality. When navigating the choice of supporting a political party, this social expectation translates into affiliation with the Democratic Party. Through fresh analysis of survey data and original experiments, White and Laird explore where and how black political norms are enforced, what this means for the future of black politics, and how this framework can be used to understand the electoral behavior of other communities. An innovative explanation for why black Americans continue in political lockstep, Steadfast Democrats sheds light on the motiva- tions consolidating an influential portion of the American electoral population.

Has this advent of audience met- rics changed journalists' work practices and professional identities? In Metrics at Work, Ang\u00e8le Christin documents the ways that jour- nalists grapple with audience data in the form of clicks, and analyzes how new forms of clickbait journalism travel across national borders. Drawing on four years of fieldwork in web newsrooms in the United States and France, including more than one hundred inter- views with journalists, Christin reveals many similarities among the media groups examined\u2014their editorial goals, technological tools, and even office furniture. Yet she uncovers crucial and paradoxical differences in how American and French journalists understand audience analytics and how these affect the news produced in each country. American journalists routinely disregard traffic numbers and primarily rely on the opinion of their peers to define journalis- tic quality. Meanwhile, French journalists fixate on internet traffic and view these numbers as a sign of their resonance in the public sphere. Christin offers cultural and historical explanations for these disparities, arguing that distinct journalistic traditions structure how journalists make sense of digital measurements in the two countries. Contrary to the popular belief that analytics and algorithms are globally homogenizing forces, Metrics at Work shows that computa- tional technologies can have surprisingly divergent ramifications for work and organizations worldwide.

Kalleberg, author of Precarious LivesAn in-depth look at how employers today perceive and evaluate job applicants with nonstandard or precarious employment historiesMaking the Cut Hiring Decisions, Bias, and the Consequences of Nonstandard, Mismatched, and Precarious Employment DAVID S. PEDULLA Millions of workers today labor in nontraditional situations involving part-time work, temporary agency employment, and skills underuti- lization or face the precariousness of long-term unemployment. To date, research has largely focused on how these experiences shape workers' well-being, rather than how hiring agents perceive and treat job applicants who have moved through these positions. Shifting the focus from workers to hiring agents, Making the Cut explores how key gatekeepers\u2014HR managers, recruiters, and talent acquisition specialists\u2014evaluate workers with nonstandard, mismatched, or precarious employment experience. Factoring in the social groups to which workers belong\u2014such as their race and gender\u2014David Pedulla shows how workers get jobs, how the hiring process unfolds, who makes the cut, and who does not. Drawing on a field experiment examining hiring decisions in four occupational groups and in-depth interviews with hiring agents in the United States, Pedulla documents and unpacks three important discoveries. Hiring professionals extract distinct mean- ings from different types of employment experiences; the effects of nonstandard, mismatched, and precarious employment histories for workers' job outcomes are not all the same; and the race and gender of workers intersect with their employment histories to shape which workers get called back for jobs. Indeed, hiring professionals use group-based stereotypes to weave divergent narratives or \"stratified stories\" about workers with similar employment experiences. The result is a complex set of inequalities in the labor market. Looking at bias and discrimination, social exclusion in the workplace, and the changing nature of work, Making the Cut probes the hiring process and offers a clearer picture of the underpinnings of getting a job in the new economy.

It is also a throwback to the early internet. The website has barely seen an upgrade since it launched in 1996. There are no banner ads. The company doesn't profit off your data. An Internet for the People explores how people use craigslist to buy and sell, find work, and find love\u2014and reveals why craigslist is becoming a lonely outpost in an increasingly corporatized web. Drawing on interviews with craigslist insiders and ordinary users, Jessa Lingel looks at the site's history and values, showing how it has mostly stayed the same while the web around it has become more commercial and far less open. She examines craigslist's legal history, describing the company's courtroom battles over issues of freedom of expression and data privacy, and explains the importance of locality in the social relationships fostered by the site. More than an online garage sale, job board, or dating site, craigslist holds vital lessons for the rest of the web. It is a website that values user privacy over profits, ease of use over slick design, and an ethos of the early web that might just hold the key to a more open, transparent, and democratic internet.

Hidden Heretics tells the fascinating, often heart-wrenching stories of married ultra-Orthodox Jewish men and women in twenty- first-century New York who lead \"double lives\" in order to protect those they love. While they no longer believe that God gave the Torah to Jews at Mount Sinai, these hidden heretics continue to live in their families and religious communities, even as they surreptitiously break Jewish commandments and explore forbidden secular worlds in person and online. Drawing on five years of fieldwork with those living double lives and the rabbis, life coaches, and religious therapists who minister to, advise, and sometimes excommunicate them, Ayala Fader investigates religious doubt and social change in the digital age. The internet, which some ultra-Orthodox rabbis call more threatening than the Holocaust, offers new possibilities for the age-old problem of religious uncertainty. Fader shows how digital media has become a lightning rod for contemporary struggles over authority and truth. She reveals the stresses and strains that hidden heretics experience, including the difficulties their choices pose for their wives, husbands, children, and, sometimes, lovers. In following those living double lives, who range from the religiously observant but open-minded on one end to atheists on the other, Fader delves into universal quandaries of faith and skepticism, the ways digital media can change us, and family frictions that arise when a person radically transforms who they are and what they believe. In stories of conflicts between faith and self-fulfillment, Hidden Heretics explores the moral compromises and divided loyalties of individuals facing life-altering crossroads.

In Western Europe's Democratic Age, Martin Conway provides an innovative new account of how a stable, durable, and remarkably uniform model of parliamentary democracy emerged in Western Europe\u2014and how this democratic ascendancy held fast until the latter decades of the twentieth century. Drawing on a wide range of sources, Conway describes how Western Europe's postwar democratic order was built by elite, intellectual, and popular forces. Much more than the consequence of the defeat of fascism and the rejection of Communism, this demo- cratic order rested on universal male and female suffrage, but also on new forms of state authority and new political forces\u2014primarily Christian and social democractic\u2014that espoused democratic values. Above all, it gained the support of the people, for whom democracy provided a new model of citizenship, which reflected the aspirations of a more prosperous and aspirational society. This democratic order did not, however, endure. Its hierarchies of class, gender, and race, which initially gave it its strength, as well as the strains of decolonization and social change, led to an explo- sion of demands for greater democratic freedoms in the 1960s, and to the much more contested democratic politics of Europe in the late twentieth century. Western Europe's Democratic Age is a compelling history that sheds new light not only on the past of European democracy but also on the unresolved question of its future.

By tracing the trajectory of interpretations and uses of the book of Joshua at various stages in its history, Havrelock shows how a marginal text for Jews in the diaspora became foundational for the formation of a mythic national identity in modern Israel.\" \u2014Colleen M. Conway, author of Sex and Slaughter in the Tent of Jael: A Cultural History of a Biblical StoryHow a controversial biblical tale of conquest and genocide became a founding story of modern Israel The Joshua Generation Israeli Occupation and the Bible RACHEL HAVRELOCK No biblical text has been more central to the politics of modern Israel than the book of Joshua. Named after a military leader who became the successor to Moses, it depicts the march of the ancient Israelites into Canaan, describing how they subjugated and mas- sacred the indigenous peoples. The Joshua Generation examines the book's centrality to the Israeli occupation today, revealing why nationalist longing and social reality are tragically out of sync in the Promised Land. Though the book of Joshua was largely ignored and reviled by diaspora Jews, the leaders of modern Israel have invoked it to promote national cohesion. Critics of occupation, meanwhile, have denounced it as a book that celebrates genocide. Rachel Havrelock looks at the composition of Joshua, showing how it reflected the fractious nature of ancient Israelite society and a desire to unify the populace under a strong monarchy. She describes how David Ben- Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, convened a study group at his home in the late 1950s, where generals, politicians, and professors reformulated the story of Israel's founding in the language of Joshua. Havrelock traces how Ben-Gurion used a brutal tale of conquest to unite an immigrant population of Jews of different ethnicities and backgrounds, casting modern Israelis and Palestinians as latter-day Israelites and Canaanites. Providing an alternative reading of Joshua, The Joshua Generation finds evidence of a decentralized society composed of tribes, clans, and woman-run households, one with relevance to today when diverse peoples share the dwindling resources of a scarred land.

LEVINE The frontiers of physics can seem impossibly remote\u2014located in the invisible quantum realm or the farthest reaches of the cosmos. But one of physics' most exciting frontiers lies much closer than we real- ize: within our own bodies and other living organisms, which display astonishingly intricate structural patterns and dynamic processes that we don't yet understand. In Living Matter , leading biophysi- cist Alex Levine explains why unraveling the mysteries of life may ultimately demand a new physics\u2014one that takes full account of the fundamental differences between living and nonliving matter. Life is distinct not only because of its evolutionary history and function, Levine explains, but because it exhibits unique complexities of structure and organizational behavior. In addition, life thrives in states that are not always predictable by means of the same physical principles used to explain nonliving systems. From single proteins to entire collections of cells, and from DNA to the eyes, ears, and brain, Levine tours the most promising areas of life where a new phys- ics might be found. Along the way, he considers many fascinating issues, such as the electrical nature of thought and the emergence of life from the inanimate.

And what lessons can be drawn from these failures today, in a world where political extremism is on the rise and rational reform based on moderation and compromise often seems impossible to achieve? In You Say You Want a Revolution? , Daniel Chirot examines a wide range of right- and left-wing revolutions around the world\u2014from the late eighteenth century to today\u2014to provide important new answers to these critical questions. From the French Revolution of the eighteenth century to the Mexican, Russian, German, Chinese, anticolonial, and Iranian revo- lutions of the twentieth, Chirot finds that moderate solutions to seri- ous social, economic, and political problems were overwhelmed by radical ideologies that promised simpler, drastic remedies. But not all revolutions had this outcome. The American Revolution didn't, although its failure to resolve the problem of slavery eventually led to the Civil War, and the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe was relatively peaceful, except in Yugoslavia. From Japan, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cambodia to Algeria, Angola, Haiti, and Romania, You Say You Want a Revolution? explains why violent radicalism, corrup- tion, and the betrayal of ideals won in so many crucial cases, why it didn't in some others\u2014and what the long-term prospects for major social change are if liberals can't deliver needed reforms.

The Industrialists traces the history of the advocacy group from its origins to today, examining its role in shaping modern capitalism, while also high- lighting the many tensions and contradictions within the organiza- tion that sometimes hampered its mission. In this compelling book, Jennifer Delton argues that NAM\u2014an organization best known for fighting unions, promoting \"free enter- prise,\" and defending corporate interests\u2014was also surprisingly pro- gressive. She shows how it encouraged companies to adopt innova- tions such as safety standards, workers' comp, and affirmative action, and worked with the US government and international organizations to promote the free exchange of goods and services across national borders. While NAM's modernizing and globalizing activities helped to make American industry the most profitable and productive in the world by midcentury, they also eventually led to deindustrialization, plant closings, and the decline of manufacturing jobs. Taking readers from the Progressive Era and the New Deal to the Reagan Revolution and the Trump presidency, The Industrialists is the story of a powerful organization that fought US manufacturing's political battles, created its economic infrastructure, and expanded its global markets\u2014only to contribute to the widespread collapse of US manufacturing by the close of the twentieth century.

What if people did not vote for what they want but for what they believe is right based on roles they implicitly assume? Do elections make people cry? This book invites readers on a unique journey inside the mind of a voter using unprecedented data from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, South Africa, and Georgia throughout a period when the world evolved from the centrist dom- inance of Obama and Mandela to the shock victories of Brexit and Trump. Michael Bruter and Sarah Harrison explore three interrelated aspects of the heart and mind of voters: the psychological bases of their behavior, how they experience elections and the emotions this entails, and how and when elections bring democratic resolution. The authors examine unique concepts including electoral identity, atmosphere, ergonomics, and hostility. From filming the shadow of voters in the polling booth, to panel study surveys, election diaries, and interviews, Bruter and Harrison unveil insights into the conscious and subconscious sides of citizens' psychology throughout a unique decade for electoral democracy. They highlight how citizens' personality, memory, and identity affect their vote and experience of elections, when elec- tions generate hope or hopelessness, and how subtle differences in electoral arrangements interact with voters' psychology to trigger different emotions. Inside the Mind of a Voter radically shifts electoral science, moving away from implicitly institution-centric visions of behavior to understand elections from the point of view of voters.

The authors apply firm competition insights to party compe- tition to understand why and when parties decline or thrive, and how party systems develop. Few political science books bridge disciplines, and this one does so successfully. It stands alone in the field of European comparative politics and is a pleasure to read.\" \u2014Liesbet Hooghe, University of North Carolina, Chapel HillHow challenger parties, acting as political entrepreneurs, are changing European democraciesPolitical Entrepreneurs The Rise of Challenger Parties in Europe CATHERINE E. D e VRIES & SARA B. HOBOLT Challenger parties are on the rise in Europe, exemplified by the likes of Podemos in Spain, the National Rally in France, the Alternative for Germany, or the Brexit Party in Great Britain. Like disruptive entre- preneurs, these parties offer new policies and defy the dominance of established party brands. In the face of these challenges and a more volatile electorate, mainstream parties are losing their grip on power. In this book, Catherine De Vries and Sara Hobolt explore why some challenger parties are so successful and what mainstream parties can do to confront these political entrepreneurs. Drawing analogies with how firms compete, De Vries and Hobolt demonstrate that political change is as much about the ability of challenger parties to innovate as it is about the inability of dominant parties to respond. Challenger parties employ two types of innovation to break established party dominance: they mobilize new issues, such as immigration, the environment, and Euroscepticism, and they employ antiestablishment rhetoric to undermine main- stream party appeal. Unencumbered by government experience, challenger parties adapt more quickly to shifting voter tastes and harness voter disenchantment. Delving into strategies of dominance versus innovation, the authors explain why European party systems have remained stable for decades, but also why they are now increas- ingly under strain. As challenger parties continue to seek to disrupt the existing order, Political Entrepreneurs shows that their ascendency fundamen- tally alters government stability and democratic politics.

POLITICAL SCIENCE90 Academic Trade\"This book enables us to see the ten- sions and insights of Jung's religious thinking, and also brings to light the importance of Keller as a theologian concerned with both psychological and social responsibility. On Theology and Psychology is rich in insights for all those interested in Jung and the forma- tion of the movement around him.\" \u2014Jeremy Carrette, author of William James's Hidden Religious ImaginationJung's correspondence with one of the twentieth century's leading theologians and ecumenicists On Theology and Psychology The Correspondence of C. G. Jung and Adolf Keller C. G. JUNG & ADOLF KELLER Edited by Marianne Jehle-Wildberger On Theology and Psychology brings together C. G. Jung's correspon- dence with Adolf Keller, a celebrated Protestant theologian who was one of the pioneers of the modern ecumenical movement and one of the first religious leaders to become interested in analytical psychol- ogy. Their relationship spanned half a century, and for many years Keller was the only major religious leader to align himself with Jung and his ideas. Both men shared a lifelong engagement with ques- tions of faith, and each grappled with God in his own distinctive way. Presented here in English for the first time are letters that pro- vide a rare look at Jung in dialogue with a theologian. Spanning some fifty years, these letters reveal an extended intellectual and spiritual discourse between two very different men as they exchange views on the nature of the divine, the compatibility of Jungian psychology and Christianity, the interpretation of the Bible and figures such as Jesus and Job, and the phenomenon of National Socialism. Although Keller was powerfully attracted to Jung's ideas, his correspondence with the famed psychiatrist demonstrates that he avoided discipleship. Both men struggled with essential questions about human existence, spirituality, and well-being, and both sought common ground where the concerns of psychologists and theologians converge. Featuring an illuminating introduction by Marianne Jehle- Wildberger, On Theology and Psychology offers incomparable insights into the development of Jung's views on theology and religion, and a unique window into a spiritual and intellectual friendship unlike any other. Marianne Jehle-Wildberger is a Swiss historian who has written extensively on the Reformation, Pietism, and modern church history.

After more than two months in hiding, Turner was captured, and quickly convicted and executed. In the Matter of Nat Turner pene- trates the historical caricature of Turner as befuddled mystic and self-styled Baptist preacher to recover the haunting persona of this legendary American slave rebel, telling of his self-discovery and the dawning of his Christian faith, of an impossible task given to him by God, and of redemptive violence and profane retribution. Much about Turner remains unknown. His extraordinary account of his life and rebellion, given in chains as he awaited trial in jail, was written down by an opportunistic white attorney and sold as a pamphlet to cash in on Turner's notoriety. But the enigmatic rebel leader had an immediate and broad impact on the American South, and his rebellion remains one of the most momentous episodes in American history. Christopher Tomlins provides a luminous account of Turner's intellectual development, religious cosmology, and motivations, and offers an original and incisive analysis of the Turner Rebellion itself and its impact on Virginia politics. Tomlins also undertakes a deeply critical examination of William Styron's 1967 novel, The Confessions of Nat Turner , which restored Turner to the American consciousness in the era of civil rights, black power, and urban riots. A speculative history that recovers Turner from the few shards of evidence we have about his life, In the Matter of Nat Turner is also a unique speculation about the meaning and uses of history itself.

What, exactly, is wrong with hierarchy, and how can this be avoided? What are the characteristics of a 'just hierarchy,' which Bell and Wang argue we should embrace? Through a range of contexts, this eminently readable book offers answers. Hierarchy emerges as having more facets than most of us ever imagined.\" \u2014Stephen C. Angle, Wesleyan UniversityA trenchant defense of hierarchy in different spheres of our lives, from the personal to the politicalJust Hierarchy Why Social Hierarchies Matter in China and the Rest of the World DANIEL A. BELL & WANG PEI All complex and large-scale societies are organized along certain hierarchies, but the concept of hierarchy has become almost taboo in the modern world. Just Hierarchy contends that this stigma is a mis- take. In fact, as Daniel Bell and Wang Pei show, it is neither possible nor advisable to do away with social hierarchies. Drawing their argu- ments from Chinese thought and culture as well as other philoso- phies and traditions, Bell and Wang ask which forms of hierarchy are justified and how these can serve morally desirable goals. They look at ways of promoting just forms of hierarchy while minimizing the influence of unjust ones, such as those based on race, sex, or caste. Which hierarchical relations are morally justified and why? Bell and Wang argue that it depends on the nature of the social relation and context. Different hierarchical principles ought to govern differ- ent kinds of social relations: what justifies hierarchy among intimates is different from what justifies hierarchy among citizens, countries, humans and animals, and humans and intelligent machines. Morally justified hierarchies can and should govern different spheres of our social lives, though these will be very different than the unjust hierar- chies that have governed us in the past. A vigorous, systematic defense of hierarchy in the modern world, Just Hierarchy examines how hierarchical social relations can have a useful purpose, not only in personal domains but also in larger political realms.

GOLDIN This book provides an unmatched introduction to eight of the most important works of classical Chinese philosophy\u2014the Analects Combining with the latest scholarship, Paul Goldin, one of world's leading authorities on the history of Chinese philosophy, places these works in rich context as he explains the origin and meaning of their compelling ideas. Because none of these classics was written in its current form by the author to whom it is attributed, the book begins by asking \"What are we reading?\" and showing that understanding the textual history of the works enriches our appreciation of them. A chapter is devoted to each of the eight works, and the chapters are organized into three sections: \"Philosophy of Heaven,\" which looks at how , and Mencius discuss, often skeptically, ) as a source of philosophical values; \"Philosophy of the Way,\" which addresses how Laozi , Zhuangzi , and Sunzi introduce the new concept of the Way (dao ) to transcend the older paradigms; and \"Two Titans at the End of an Age,\" which examines how Xunzi and Han Feizi adapt the best ideas of the earlier thinkers for a coming imperial age. In addition, the book presents clear and insightful explanations of the protean and frequently misunderstood concept of qi \u2014and of a crucial characteristic of Chinese philosophy, nondeductive reasoning. The result is an invaluable account of an endlessly fascinating and influential philosophical tradition. Paul R.

The lifespan of Earth can seem unfathomable compared to the brevity of human existence, but this view of time denies our deep roots in Earth's history\u2014and the magnitude of our effects on the planet.

Women struggle to balance breadwinning with the bulk of parenting, and social policies aren't helping. Of all Western indus- trialized countries, the United States ranks dead last for supportive work-family policies. Can American women look to Europe for solutions? Making Motherhood Work draws on interviews that Caitlyn Collins conducted over five years with 135 middle-class working mothers in Sweden, Germany, Italy, and the United States. She explores how women navigate work and family given the different policy supports available in each country. Taking readers into wom- en's homes, neighborhoods, and workplaces, Collins shows that mothers' expectations depend on context and that policies alone cannot solve women's struggles. With women held to unrealistic standards, the best solutions demand that we redefine motherhood, work, and family. \"This study, whose comparative approach illuminates how cultural norms affect policies and economic results, is intelligent, thought-provoking, and clarifying.\"\u2014Publishers Weekly \"Ultimately, this book is a rallying cry to value 'caregiving, as well as the people who provide that care.' \"\u2014Emma Jacobs, Financial Times \"The breadth and depth of Making Motherhood Work make it a unique and invaluable contribution that calls for nothing less than a worldwide movement for work-family justice.\"\u2014Kathleen Gerson, author of The Unfinished Revolution Caitlyn Collins is assistant professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis.

It is this paradox, says historian Michael Brenner\u2014the Jewish people's wish for a homeland both normal and exceptional\u2014 that shapes Israel's ongoing struggle to define itself and secure a place among nations. In Search of Israel is a major new history of this struggle from the late nineteenth century to our time. \"A rare history that compels the reader to think constantly about the present and even about the future.\"\u2014David K.

Though we may laud wealthy individuals who give away their money for society's benefit, Just Giving shows how such generosity not only isn't the unassailable good we think it to be but might also under- mine democratic values. Big philanthropy is often an exercise of power, the conversion of private assets into public influence. And it is a form of power that is largely unaccountable and lavishly tax- advantaged. Philanthropy currently fails democracy, but Rob Reich argues that it can be redeemed. Just Giving investigates the ethical and political dimensions of philanthropy and considers how giving might better support democratic values and promote justice. \"Essential reading for anyone worried about money in politics.\" \u2014Larissa MacFarquhar \"Reich judiciously weighs the philosophical pros and cons of tax-subsidised philanthropy.\"\u2014Edward Luce, Financial Times \"[Reich] treats readers to rich insights from enlightenment philosophers onwards who have criticised the assumption that mega-giving from the mega-rich is something to celebrate.\"\u2014 Linsey McGoey, Times Higher Education \"An instant classic.\"\u2014David Callahan, Inside Philanthropy \"Anyone engaged in serious philanthropy needs to wrestle with Reich's analysis.\"\u2014Larry Kramer, president of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation Rob Reich is professor of political science and codirector of the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society at Stanford University.

This change is being driven by powerful cognitive tools, enabled by the internet, which are greatly accelerating scientific discovery. There are many books about how the internet is changing business, the workplace, or government. But this is the first book about something much more fundamental: how the internet is transforming our collective intelli- gence and our understanding of the world. From the collaborative mathematicians of the Polymath Project to the amateur astronomers of Galaxy Zoo, Reinventing Discovery tells the exciting story of the unprecedented new era in networked science. \"Reinventing Discovery will frame serious discus- sion and ideas.\" \u2014Chris Lintott, Nature \"Timely and important.\"\u2014Jack Stilgoe, Guardian Michael Nielsen is one of the pioneers of quantum computing.

In Trigonometric Delights , Eli Maor dispels this view. Rejecting the usual descriptions of sine, cosine, and their trigono- metric relatives, he brings the subject to life in a com- pelling blend of history, biography, and mathematics. From the proto-trigonometry of the Egyptian pyramid builders and the first true trigonometry developed by Greek astronomers, to the epicycles and hypocycles of the toy Spirograph, Maor presents both a survey of the main elements of trigonometry and a unique account of its vital contribution to science and social growth. A tapestry of stories, curiosities, insights, and illustrations, Trigonometric Delights irrevocably changes how we see this essential mathematical discipline. \"If you always wanted to know where trigonometry came from, and what it's good for, you'll find plenty here to enlighten you.\"\u2014Ian Stewart, New Scientist Eli Maor is a former professor of the history of mathe- matics at Loyola University Chicago.

Breaking with the practice of close reading of individual texts, Frye seeks to describe a common basis for understanding the full range of literary forms by examining archetypes, genres, poetic language, and the relations among the text, the reader, and society. Using a dazzling array of examples, he argues that understanding \"the structure of literature as a total form\" also allows us to see the profoundly liberating effect literature can have. \"Brilliant. . . .

MARTY For fascination, influence, inspiration, and contro- versy, Dietrich Bonhoeffer's Letters and Papers from Prison is unmatched by any other book of Christian reflection written in the twentieth century. A Lutheran pastor and theologian, Bonhoeffer spent two years in Nazi prisons before being executed at age thirty-nine for his role in the plot to kill Hitler. Ever since it was published in 1951, Letters and Papers from Prison has had a tremendous impact on Christian and secular thought, and has helped establish Bonhoeffer's reputation as one of the most important Protestant thinkers of the twentieth century. In this, the first his- tory of the book's remarkable global career, National Book Award-winning writer Martin Marty tells how and why Letters and Papers from Prison has been read and used in such dramatically different ways, from the Cold War to today. \"[A] brilliant study.\"\u2014Lawrence S.

Larrimore traces Job's reception by figures such as Gregory the Great, William Blake, and Elie Wiesel, and reveals how Job has come to be viewed as the Bible's answer to the problem of evil and the perennial question of why a God who supposedly loves justice permits bad things to happen to good people. \"Subtle and superbly thorough.\"\u2014Brian Bethune, Maclean's \"As eloquent and engaging as it is carefully researched and richly insightful.\"\u2014Timothy Beal, author of The Rise and Fall of the Bible Mark Larrimore directs the Religious Studies Program at The New School's Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts.

Like other religions in the United States, it has witnessed a decline in the number of participants over the past forty years, and many who remain active struggle to reconcile their hallowed traditions with new perspec- tives\u2014from feminism and the LGBTQ movement to \"do-it-yourself religion\" and personally defined spirituality. Taking a fresh look at American Judaism today, Jack Wertheimer, a leading authority on the subject, sets out to discover how Jews of various orientations practice their religion in this radically altered landscape. \"Vital, necessary, and enjoyable to read . . . a significant contribution to the literature about this ever-altering community.\"\u2014Roberta Rosenthal Kwall, Commentary Jack Wertheimer is professor of American Jewish history at the Jewish Theological Seminary.

We're all expected to work to survive and get ahead, and devoting energy to anything but labor and self-improvement can seem like a luxury or a moral failure. Far from questioning this conventional wisdom, modern philosophers have entrenched it, viewing idleness as an obstacle to the ethical need people have to be autonomous, to be useful, to con- tribute to the social good, or simply to avoid bore- dom. In Idleness , the first book to challenge modern philosophy's portrayal of inactivity, Brian O'Connor argues that the case against an indifference to work and effort is flawed\u2014and that idle aimlessness may instead allow for the highest form of freedom. \"Concise, well-argued and highly readable.\" \u2014Harry R.

Unequal Hopes and Lives in Pursuit of the American Dream CAROL GRAHAM The Declaration of Independence states that all people are endowed with certain unalienable rights. Among them is the pursuit of happiness. But is hap- piness available equally to everyone in America? How about elsewhere in the world? Carol Graham draws on cutting-edge research linking income inequality with well-being to show how the widening prosperity gap has led to rising inequality in people's beliefs, hopes, and aspirations. The result is an optimism gap between rich and poor that, if left unchecked, could lead to an increasingly divided society. Happiness for All? highlights the importance of well-being measures in identifying and monitoring trends in life satisfac- tion and optimism, and demonstrates how hope and happiness can lead to improved economic outcomes. \"This is a very important book, on the deepest social problem facing the United States today.\" \u2014George Akerlof, Nobel Laureate in Economics Carol Graham is the Leo Pasvolsky Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and College Park Professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy.

But its spectacular moments of heaven-sent plagues and parting seas overshadow its true significance, says Jan Assmann, a leading historian of ancient religion. The story of Moses guiding the enslaved children of Israel out of captivity to become God's chosen people is the foundation of an entirely new idea of religion, one that lives on today in many of the world's faiths. First introduced in Exodus, new ideas of faith, revelation, and above all covenant transformed basic assumptions about humankind's relationship to the divine and became the bedrock of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. \"Jan Assmann's latest book is a blockbuster\u2014 beautifully written, capacious, learned, and endlessly creative.\"\u2014Jonathan Sheehan, University of Califor- nia, Berkeley Jan Assmann is honorary professor of cultural studies at the University of Konstanz and professor emeritus of Egyptology at the University of Heidelberg.

LEVENSON The love of God is arguably the most essential element in Judaism\u2014but also one of the most confounding. In biblical and rabbinic literature, the obligation to love God appears as a formal command- ment. Yet most people today think of love as a feeling and wonder how an emotion can be commanded. Jon Levenson traces the origins of the concept to the ancient institution of covenant, showing how covenantal love is a matter neither of sentiment nor of dry legalism. In origin, the love of God is, instead, thoroughly relational in nature, inseparable from the deeply personal two-way relationship that finds expression in God's mysterious love for the people of Israel, who in turn observe God's laws out of profound gratitude for his acts of deliverance and continuing faithfulness to him in the face of tempta- tions to abandon the relationship. \"Highly readable and engaging.\" \u2014Clint Schnekloth, Word & World Jon D.

IRWIN Free trade is always under attack, more than ever in recent years. The imposition of numerous U.S. tariffs in 2018, and the retaliation they have drawn, have thrust trade issues to the top of the policy agenda. Critics contend that free trade brings economic pain, including plant closings and worker layoffs, and that trade agreements serve corporate interests, under- cut domestic environmental regulations, and erode national sovereignty. Why are global trade and agree- ments such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership so con- troversial? Does free trade deserve its bad reputation? In Free Trade under Fire , Douglas Irwin sweeps aside the misconceptions that run rampant in the debate over trade and gives readers a clear understanding of the issues involved. \"A wealth of reporting, both of trade-theory debates and of recent political battles in America over trade. . . .

Southerners are more likely to support Republican candidates, gun rights, and the death penalty, and southern whites harbor higher levels of racial resentment than whites in other parts of the country. Why haven't these sentiments evolved? Deep Roots shows that the entrenched views of white southerners are a direct consequence of the region's slaveholding history.

FELTER & JACOB N. SHAPIRO With Vestal McIntyre The way wars are fought has changed starkly over the past sixty years. International military campaigns used to play out between armies at central fronts. Today's conflicts find major powers facing rebel insurgencies deploying elusive methods, from improvised explo- sives to terrorist attacks. Presenting a transformative understanding of these contemporary confrontations, Small Wars, Big Data shows that a revolution in the study of conflict yields new insights into terrorism, civil wars, and foreign interventions. \"The soldier-scholar authors, who served in the wars they describe, have produced a book that should be required reading for military leaders, policymakers, development professionals, and diplomats.\" \u2014Retired U.S. Army General David H.

PORTER In the early 1800s, a century before there was any concept of the gene, physicians in insane asylums began to record causes of madness in their admis- sion books. Almost from the beginning, they pointed to heredity as the most important of these causes. Genetics in the Madhouse is the untold story of how the collection of hereditary data in asylums and prisons gave rise to a new science of human heredity. Theodore Porter looks at the institutional use of inno- vative quantitative practices\u2014such as pedigree charts and censuses of mental illness\u2014that were worked out in the madhouse long before the manipulation of DNA became possible in the lab. \"[A] bold, dauntingly well-documented book.\" \u2014David Dobbs, Nature \"Porter has unearthed a radically new history of human genetics, one that evokes not the double helix but the humble filing cabinet.\"\u2014Emily M.

ROBERTS As authoritarian governments around the world develop sophisticated technologies for controlling information, many observers have predicted that these controls would be easily evaded by savvy internet users. In Censored , Margaret Roberts demonstrates that even censorship that is easy to circumvent can still be enormously effective. Taking advantage of digital data harvested from the Chinese internet and leaks from China's Propaganda Department, Roberts sheds light on how censorship influences the Chinese public. Drawing parallels between censorship in China and the way information is manipulated in the United States and other democracies, she reveals how internet users are susceptible to control even in the most open societies. Censored gives an unprecedented view of how govern- ments encroach on the media consumption of citizens. \"The clearest and most convincing explanation of how information is controlled in today's China.\" \u2014Ian Johnson, New York Review of Books Margaret E.

SHKLAR With a new foreword by Samuel Moyn After Utopia was Judith Shklar's first book, a harbin- ger of her renowned career in political philosophy. Throughout the many changes in political thought during the last half century, this important work has withstood the test of time. In After Utopia , Shklar explores the decline of political philosophy, from Enlightenment optimism to modern cultural despair, and she offers a critical, creative analysis of this downward trend. She looks at Romantic and Christian social thought, and she shows that while the present political fatalism may be unavoidable, the prophets of despair have failed to explain the world they so dislike, leaving the possibility of a new and vigorous political philosophy. \"More relevant today than ever, Judith Shklar offers brilliant insights into world-historic rejections of rationalism and optimism. She challenges us to find our way beyond both cultural despair and reli- gious fatalism.\"\u2014Amy Gutmann, president of the University of Pennsylvania Judith N.

He was also the architect of the Armenian Genocide, which set the stage for a century that would witness political terror and ethnic cleansing on a scale never imagined. Here is the first biography in English of the revolutionary figure who not only prepared the way for Atat\u00fcrk and the founding of the republic in 1923, but who shaped the modern world as well.

G. MANNING In The Open Sea , J. G. Manning offers a major new history of economic life in the Mediterranean world during the Iron Age, from Phoenician trading down to the Hellenistic era and the beginning of Rome's supremacy. Drawing on a wide range of ancient sources and the latest social theory, Manning suggests that the search for an illusory single ancient economy has obscured the diversity of the Mediterranean world, including changes in political economies over time and differences in cultural con- ceptions of property and money. At the same time, this groundbreaking book shows how the region's economies became increasingly interconnected during this period\u2014and why the origins of the mod- ern economy extend far beyond Greece and Rome. \"An expert and bracing survey.\"\u2014Kyle Harper, EH.net \"Manning draws on new evidence to rethink ancient history as a whole.\"\u2014Philip T.

Henry Shue asks: Which human rights ought to be the first honored and the last sacrificed? Shue argues that subsistence rights, along with security rights and liberty rights, serve as the ground of all other human rights. This classic work, now available in a thor- oughly updated fortieth-anniversary edition, includes a substantial new chapter by the author examining how the accelerating transformation of our climate progres- sively undermines the bases of subsistence. \"Shue has written the classical statement affirming that the rich nations are required by justice and by international law to share their abundance with those millions who are chronically malnourished.\" \u2014Robert F.

In this short, accessible book, eminent philos- opher and Kant expert Yirmiyahu Yovel helps readers find their way through the maze of Kant's classic by providing a clear and authoritative summary of the entire work. The distillation of decades of studying and teaching Kant, Yovel's \"systematic explication\" untangles the ideas and arguments of the Critique in the order in which Kant presents them. The result is an invaluable guide for philosophers and students. \"Clear and well informed. . . .

How can these two aspects of mathe- matics be reconciled? This concise book provides a systematic, accessible introduction to the field that is trying to answer that question: the philosophy of mathematics. \u00d8ystein Linnebo, one of the world's leading scholars on the subject, introduces all of the classical approaches to the field as well as more specialized issues, including mathematical intuition, potential infinity, and the search for new mathemati- cal axioms.

By exploring Shakespeare's engage- ments with the humanist traditions of early modern England and Europe, Rhodri Lewis reveals a Hamlet unseen for centuries: an innovative, coherent, and exhilaratingly bleak tragedy in which the governing ideologies of Shakespeare's age are scrupulously upended. Recovering a work of far greater magni- tude than the tragedy of a young man who cannot make up his mind, Lewis shows that in Hamlet , as in King Lear , Shakespeare confronts his audiences with a universe that received ideas are powerless to illuminate\u2014and where everyone must find their own way through the dark. \"Lewis's brilliant analysis here gives fresh meaning to long-familiar if half-understood phrases.\" \u2014James Shapiro, New York Review \"Lewis's deeply researched monograph repays close attention.\"\u2014Jonathan Bate, Times Literary Supplement Rhodri Lewis is Senior Research Scholar in English at Princeton University.

The publication of Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward in 1888 opened the floodgates to an unprecedented wave of utopian writing. William Morris was a committed socialist whose News from Nowhere envisions a workers' Arcadia. Edward Carpenter boldly argued that homosexuals constitute a utopian vanguard. Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote numerous utopian fic- tions, including Herland , a visionary tale of an all-female society. These writers believed in radical gender and class equality, envisioning new forms of familial and romantic relationships, and were committed to living a simple life rooted in a restored natural world. \"Instructive and touching.\"\u2014Adam Gopnik, New Yorker Michael Robertson is professor of English at The College of New Jersey.

Sara Blair traces the career of the Lower East Side as a place where image-makers, writers, and social reformers tested new techniques for apprehending America\u2014and their subjects looked back, confronting the means used to represent them. This dynamic shaped the birth of American photojournalism, early cinema, and the changing life of print culture as well as the work of such figures as Stephen Crane, Henry Roth, Ben Shahn, Allen Ginsberg, Martha Rosler, and LeRoi Jones. How the Other Half Looks examines the practices of observation that emerged from this critical site of encounter, showing how they have informed changing narratives of America, its citizens, and its possible futures. \"A fascinating visual history.\"\u2014Bryan Cheyette, Times Literary Supplement Sara Blair is the Patricia S.

Cochrane It is impossible to understand the Middle Ages with- out grasping the importance of The Golden Legend , the most popular medieval collection of saints' lives. Assembled in the thirteenth century by Genoese arch- bishop Jacobus de Voragine, the book became the medieval equivalent of a bestseller. In Search of Sacred Time is the first comprehensive history and inter- pretation of this crucial book. Jacques Le Goff, who was one of the world's most renowned medievalists, provides a lucid and compelling account that shows how The Golden Legend Christianized time itself, rec- onciling human and divine temporality. Authoritative, eloquent, and original, In Search of Sacred Time is a major reinterpretation of a book that is central to comprehending the medieval imagination. \"Le Goff's reading is brilliant and wholly persua- sive, providing a riveting sense of what contemporary readers and listeners perceived in this most popular book. In Search of Sacred Time is a lovely meditation.\" \u2014William Chester Jordan, Princeton University Jacques Le Goff (1924-2014) was a world-renowned historian of the Middle Ages.

Masco examines how diverse groups in and around Los Alamos, New Mexico understood and responded to the U.S. nuclear weapons project in the post-Cold War period. He shows that the American focus on potential nuclear apocalypse during the Cold War obscured the broader effects of the nuclear complex on society, and that the atomic bomb produced a new cognitive orientation toward daily life, reconfigur- ing concepts of time, nature, race, and citizenship. \"Masco's important and impressive study ably demonstrates that nuclear weapons need not be detonated to have profound effects.\"\u2014David Kaiser, American Scientist Joseph Masco is professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago.

Yet, it's now clear that genes are not the only basis of heredity. In Extended Heredity , evolutionary biologists Russell Bonduriansky and Troy Day explore the latest research showing that what happens during our lifetimes\u2014and even our parents' and grandparents' lifetimes\u2014can influence the features of our descendants. Based on this evidence, Bonduriansky and Day develop an extended concept of heredity that upends ideas about how traits can and cannot be transmitted across gen- erations, opening the door to a new understanding of inheritance, evolution, and even human health. \"The most compelling and accessible account of this topic to date.\"\u2014Kevin Laland, Science Russell Bonduriansky is professor of evolutionary biology at the University of New South Wales in Australia.

Ann Jefferson's Nathalie Sarraute: A Life Between is the authoritative biography of this major writer. Sarraute's life spanned a century and a continent. Born in tsarist Russia to Jewish parents, she was soon uprooted and brought to the city that became her lifelong home, Paris. This dislocation presaged a life marked by ambiguity and ambivalence. A stepchild in two families, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 in Paris, a Jew in bourgeois French society, and a woman in a man's literary world, Sarraute was educated at Oxford, Berlin, and the Sorbonne. She embarked on a career in law that was ended by the Nazi occupation of France, and she spent much of the war in hiding. Rising to literary eminence after the Liberation, she was initially associated with the existentialist circle of Beauvoir and Sartre, before becoming the principal theorist and practitioner of the avant-garde French novel of the 1950s and 1960s. Her tireless exploration of the deepest parts of our inner psychological life produced an oeuvre that remains daringly modern and resolutely unclassifiable. Nathalie Sarraute: A Life Between explores Sarraute's work and the intellectual, social, and politi - cal context from which it emerged. Ann Jefferson is professor emerita of French at the University of Oxford.

Pray what is the matter with me?\" The plaint of an anonymous reader in 1712 sounds with endear - ing frankness a note of consternation that resonates throughout The Faerie Queene' s reception history, from its first known reader, Spenser's friend Gabriel Harvey, who urged him to write anything else instead, to Virginia Woolf, who insisted that if one wants to like the poem, \"the first essential is, of course, not to read\" it. For more than four centuries critics have sought to counter this strain of readerly resistance, but rather than trying to remedy the frustrations and failures of Spenser's readers, Catherine Nicholson cherishes them as a sensitive barometer of shifts in the culture of reading itself. Indeed, tracking the poem's mixed fortunes in the hands of its bored, baffled, outraged, intoxicated, obsessive, and exhausted readers turns out to be an excellent way of rethinking the past and future pros - pects of literary study. By examining the responses of readers from Queen Elizabeth and the keepers of Renaissance commonplace books to nineteenth- century undergraduates, Victorian children, and modern scholars, this book offers a compelling new interpretation of the poem and an important new perspective on what it means to read, or not to read, a work of literature. Catherine Nicholson is associate professor of English at Yale University and the author of Uncommon Tongues: Eloquence and Eccentricity in the English Renaissance 9780691201597 Eighteenth-Century Architecture of Intimacy DANIELLE BOBKER Long before it was a hidden storage space or a meta - phor for queer and trans shame, the closet was one of the most charged settings in English architecture. This private room provided seclusion for reading, writing, praying, dressing, and collecting\u2014and for talking in select company. In their closets, kings and duchesses shared secrets with favorites, midwives and apothecar - ies dispensed remedies, and newly wealthy men and women expanded their social networks. In The Closet , Danielle Bobker presents a literary and cultural history of these sites of extrafamilial intimacy, revealing how, as they proliferated both in buildings and in books, closets also became powerful symbols of the unstable virtual intimacy of the first mass-medium of print. Focused on the connections between status- conscious\u2014and often awkward\u2014interpersonal dynamics and an increasingly inclusive social and media landscape, The Closet examines dozens of historical and fictional encounters taking place in the various iterations of this room: courtly closets, bath closets, privies, and the \"moving closet\" of the coach, among many others. Turning finally to queer theory, The Closet discovers uncanny echoes of the eighteenth-century language of the closet in twenty-first-century coming-out narratives. Featuring more than thirty illustrations, The Closet offers a richly detailed and compelling account of an eighteenth-century setting and symbol of inti - macy that continues to resonate today.

Poetry\u2014even by the greats\u2014is rife with mistakes. In The Poet's Mistake , critic and poet Erica McAlpine gathers together for the first time numerous instances of these errors, from well-known historical gaffes to never-before-noticed grammatical incongruities, mis - spellings, and solecisms. But unlike the many critics and other readers who consider such errors felicitous or essential to the work itself, she makes a compel - ling case for calling a mistake a mistake, arguing that denying the possibility of error does a disservice to poets and their poems. Tracing the temptation to justify poets' errors from Aristotle through Freud, McAlpine demonstrates that the study of poetry's mistakes is also a study of critical attitudes toward mistakes, which are usually too generous\u2014and often at the expense of the poet's intentions. Through remarkable close readings of Wordsworth, Keats, Browning, Clare, Dickinson, Crane, Bishop, Heaney, Ashbery, and others, The Poet's Mistake shows that errors are an inevitable part of poetry's making and that our responses to them reveal a great deal about our faith in poetry\u2014and about how we read.

Jon Elster writes in the spirit of Alexis de Tocqueville, who described this tumultuous era with an eye toward individual and group psy - chology and the functioning of institutions. Whereas Tocqueville saw the old regime as a breeding ground for revolution, Elster, more specifically, identifies the rural and urban conflicts that fueled the constitution- making process from 1789 to 1791. He presents a new approach to history writing, one that supplements the historian's craft with the tools and insights of modern social science. Elster draws on important French and Anglo-American scholarship as well as a treasure trove of historical evidence from the period, such as the Memoirs of Saint-Simon, the letters of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, the journals of the lawyer Barbier and the bookseller Hardy, the Remonstrances of Malesherbes, and La Bruy\u00e8re's maxims. Masterfully written and unparalleled in scope, France before 1789 is the first volume of a trilogy that promises to transform our understanding of consti - tution making in the eighteenth century. Volume 2 will look at revolutionary America in the years leading up to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 while the third volume will examine all facets of the French and American assemblies.

CHARLES LARMORE What is political philosophy? What are its fundamen - tal problems? And how should it be distinguished from moral philosophy? In this book, Charles Larmore redefines the distinctive aims of political philosophy, reformulating in this light the basis of a liberal understanding of politics. Because political life is characterized by deep and enduring conflict between rival interests and differing moral ideals, the core problems of political philosophy are the regulation of conflict and the condi - tions under which the members of society may thus be made subject to political authority. We cannot assume that reason will lead to unanimity about these matters because individuals hold different moral convictions. Larmore therefore analyzes the concept of reasonable disagreement and investigates the ways we can adjudi - cate conflicts between those who reasonably disagree about the nature of the human good and the proper basis of political society. Challenging both the classical liberalism of Locke, Kant, and Mill, and more recent theories of political realism proposed by Bernard Williams and others, Larmore argues for a version of political liberalism that is centered on political legiti - macy, rather than on social justice, and that aims to be well suited to our times, rather than universally valid. Forceful and thorough yet concise, What Is Political Philosophy? proposes a new definition of political philosophy and demonstrates the profound implications of that definition. Charles Larmore is professor of philosophy and the W. Duncan MacMillan Family Professor in the Humanities at Brown University.

F. Strawson's 1962 paper \"Freedom and Resent - ment\" is one of the most influential in modern moral philosophy, prompting responses across multiple disciplines, from psychology to sociology. In Freedom, Resentment, and the Metaphysics of Morals , Pamela Hieronymi closely reexamines Strawson's paper and concludes that his argument has been underesti - mated and misunderstood. Line by line, Hieronymi carefully untangles the complex strands of Strawson's ideas. After elucidating his conception of moral responsibility and his division between \"reactive\" and \"objective\" responses to the actions and attitudes of others, Hieronymi turns to his central argument. Strawson argues that, because deter - minism is an entirely general thesis, true of everyone at all times, its truth does not undermine moral responsi - bility. Hieronymi finds the two common interpretations of this argument, \"the simple Humean interpretation\" and \"the broadly Wittgensteinian interpretation,\" both deficient. Drawing on Strawson's wider work in logic, philosophy of language, and metaphysics, Hieronymi concludes that his argument rests on an implicit, and previously overlooked, metaphysics of morals, one grounded in Strawson's \"social naturalism.\" Rigorous, concise, and insightful, Freedom, Resentment, and the Metaphysics of Morals sheds new light on Strawson's thinking.

Two Gods in Heaven not only repatriates New Testament ideas to their originary Second Temple Jew - ish matrix; it also offers an enriching and intriguing view of the theological dynamics that formed the West.\" \u2014Paula Fredriksen, author of When Christians Were Jews A book that challenges our most basic assumptions about Judeo- Christian monotheism Religion 133Two Gods in Heaven Jewish Concepts of God in Antiquity PETER SCH\u00c4FER Contrary to popular belief, Judaism was not always strictly monothe - istic. Two Gods in Heaven reveals the long and little-known history of a second, junior god in Judaism, showing how this idea was embraced by rabbis and Jewish mystics in the early centuries of the common era and casting Judaism's relationship with Christianity in an entirely different light. Drawing on an in-depth analysis of ancient sources that have received little attention until now, Peter Sch\u00e4fer demonstrates how the Jews of the pre-Christian Second Temple period had various names for a second heavenly power\u2014such as Son of Man, Son of the Most High, and Firstborn before All Creation. He traces the development of the concept from the Son of Man vision in the biblical book of Daniel to the Qumran literature, the Ethiopic book of Enoch, and the Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria. After the destruction of the Second Temple, the picture changes drastically. While the early Christians of the New Testament took up the idea and developed it further, their Jewish contemporaries were divided. Most rejected the second god, but some\u2014particularly the Jews of Babylonia and the writers of early Jewish mysticism\u2014revived the ancient Jewish notion of two gods in heaven. Describing how early Christianity and certain strands of rabbinic Judaism competed for ownership of a second god to the creator, this boldly argued and elegantly written book radically trans - forms our understanding of Judeo-Christian monotheism.

M cNALLY From North Dakota's Standing Rock encampments to Arizona's San Francisco Peaks, Native Americans have repeatedly asserted legal rights to religious freedom to protect their sacred places, practices, objects, knowledge, and ancestral remains. But these claims have met with little success in court because Native American communal traditions don't fit easily into modern Western definitions of religion. In Defend the Sacred , Michael McNally explores how, in response to this situation, Native peoples have creatively turned to other legal means to safeguard what matters to them. To articulate their claims, Native peoples have resourcefully used the languages of cultural resources under environmental and historic preservation law; of sovereignty under treaty-based federal Indian law; and, increasingly, of Indigenous rights under interna - tional human rights law. Along the way, Native nations still draw on the rhetorical power of religious freedom to gain legislative and regulatory successes beyond the First Amendment. The story of Native American advocates and their struggle to protect their liberties, Defend the Sacred casts new light on discus - sions of religious freedom, cultural resource management, and the vitality of Indigenous religions today.

Movable type was adopted in the Middle East only in the early nineteenth century, and it wasn't until the second half of the century that the first works of classical Islamic religious scholarship were printed there. But from that moment on, Ahmed El Shamsy reveals, the technology of print transformed Islamic scholarship and Arabic literature. In the first wide-ranging account of the effects of print and the publishing industry on Islamic scholarship, El Shamsy tells the fascinating story of how a small group of editors and intellectuals brought forgotten works of Islamic literature into print and defined what became the classical canon of Islamic thought. Through the lens of the literary culture of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Arab cities\u2014especially Cairo, a hot spot of the nascent publishing business\u2014he explores the contributions of these individuals, who included some of the most important thinkers of the time. Through their efforts to find and publish classical literature, El Shamsy shows, many nearly lost works were recovered, disseminated, and harnessed for agendas of linguistic, ethical, and religious reform. Bringing to light the agents and events of the Islamic print revolution, Rediscovering the Islamic Classics is an absorbing exam - ination of the central role printing and its advocates played in the intellectual history of the modern Arab world.

Investigating two centuries of sponsorship and its related practices in American living rooms, churches, and shopping malls, Hillary Kaell examines the myriad ways that Christians who don't travel outside of the United States have cultivated global connections, and the ethical and ideological questions involved. Popular child sponsorship organizations, including World Vision, Compassion International, and ChildFund, raise billions of dollars and circulate millions of letters and photos around the world annually. Kaell traces the movement of money, letters, and images, along with a wide array of the lesser-known techniques of sponsorship, such as playacting, hymn singing, eat - ing, and fasting. She shows how, through this process, U.S. Christians attempt to hone globalism of a particu - lar sort by oscillating between the sensory experiences of a God's eye view and the intimacy of human relat - edness. These global aspirations are buoyed by grand hopes and subject to intractable limitations, since they so often rely on the inequities they claim to redress. Based on extensive interviews, archival research, and fieldwork, Christian Globalism at Home explores how U.S. Christians imagine and experience the world without ever leaving home.

History, Peoplehood, and Purpose ADAM SUTCLIFFE What is the purpose of Jews in the world? The Bible singles out the Jews as God's \"chosen people,\" but the significance of this spe - cial status has been understood in many different ways over the centuries. What Are Jews For? traces the history of the idea of Jewish purpose from its ancient and medieval foundations to the modern era, showing how it has been central to Western thinking on the meanings of peoplehood for everybody. Adam Sutcliffe delves into the links between Jewish and Christian messianism and the associ - ation of Jews with universalist and transformative ideals in modern philosophy, politics, literature, and social thought. The Jews have been accorded a crucial role in both Jewish and Christian conceptions of the end of history, when they will usher the world into a new epoch of unity and harmony. Since the seven - teenth century this messianic underlay to the idea of Jewish purpose has been repeatedly reconfigured in new forms. From the political theology of the early modern era to almost all domains of modern thought\u2014religious, social, economic, nationalist, radical, assimila - tionist, satirical, and psychoanalytical\u2014Jews have retained a close association with positive transformation for all. Sutcliffe reveals the persistent importance of the \"Jewish Purpose Question\" in the attempts of Jews and non-Jews alike to connect the collective purpose of particular communities to the broader betterment of humanity. Shedding light on questions of exceptionalism, pluralism, and universalism, What Are Jews For? explores an intricate question that remains widely resonant in contemporary culture and political debate.

Drawing on extended interviews and first-hand observations of more than eighty murder trials, Arzoo Osanloo explores why some families of victims forgive perpetra - tors and how a wide array of individuals contribute to the fraught business of negotiating reconciliation. Based on Qur'anic principles, Iran's criminal codes encourage mercy and compel judicial officials to help parties reach a settlement. As no formal regulations exist to guide those involved, an informal cottage industry has grown around forgiveness advo - cacy. Interested parties\u2014including attorneys, judges, social workers, the families of victims and perpetra - tors, and even performing artists\u2014intervene in cases, drawing from such sources as scripture, ritual, and art to stir feelings of forgiveness. These actors forge new and sometimes conflicting strategies to secure forbearance, and some aim to reform social attitudes and laws on capital punishment. Arzoo Osanloo is associate professor in the Department of Law, Societies, and Justice and the director of the Middle East Center at the University of Washington.

MEYER The university is experiencing an unprecedented level of success today, as more universities in more countries educate more students in more fields. At the same time, the university has become central to a knowledge society based on the belief that everyone can, through higher education, access universal truths and apply them in the name of progress. This book traces the university's rise over the past hundred years to become the cultural linchpin of contemporary society, revealing how the so-called ivory tower has become profoundly interlinked with almost every area of human endeavor. David John Frank and John Meyer describe how, as the university expanded, student and faculty bodies became larger, more diverse, and more empowered to turn knowledge into action. Their contributions to society underscored the public importance of scholar - ship, and as the cultural authority of universities grew they increased the scope of their research and teach - ing interests. As a result, the university has become the bedrock of today's information-based society. But, as Frank and Meyer also show, the conditions that helped spur the university's recent ascendance are not immutable: eruptions of nation - alism, authoritarianism, and illiberalism undercut the university's universalistic and rationalistic premises, and may threaten the centrality of the university itself.

However, some groups within these states are distinctly more effective and public oriented than the rest. Why? Patchwork Leviathan explains how a few spectacularly effective state organizations manage to thrive amid general institutional weakness and succeed against impressive odds. Drawing on the Hobbesian image of the state as Leviathan, Erin Metz McDonnell argues that many seemingly weak states actually have a wide range of administrative capacities. Such states are in fact patchworks sewn loosely together from scarce resources into the semblance of unity. McDonnell demonstrates that when the human, cognitive, and material resources of bureaucracy are rare, it is critically important how they are distributed. Too often, scarce bureaucratic resources are scattered throughout the state, yielding little effect. McDonnell reveals how a sufficient concentration of resources clustered within particular pockets of a state can be transformative, enabling distinctively effective organi - zations to emerge from a sea of ineffectiveness. Patchwork Leviathan offers a comprehensive analysis of successful statecraft in institutionally challenging environments. This incisive book explains how these highly effective pockets differ from the Western bureaucracies on which so much state and organizational theory is based.

One-sixth of humanity now lives in either a Chinese or Indian city. This transformation has unleashed enormous pressures on land use, housing, and the environment. Despite the stakes, the workings of urban governance in China and India remain obscure and poorly understood. In this book, Xuefei Ren explores how China and India govern their cities and how their different styles of governance produce inequality and exclu - sion. Drawing upon historical-comparative analyses and extensive fieldwork (in Beijing, Guangzhou, Wukan, Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata), Ren investi - gates the ways that Chinese and Indian cities manage land acquisition, slum clearance, and air pollution. She discovers that the two countries address these issues through radically different approaches. Ren traces the origins of these approaches to late imperial China and precolonial India. She then shows how these forms have evolved to shape urban growth and residents' struggles today. As the number of urban residents in China and India reaches beyond a billion, Governing the Urban in China and India makes clear that the development of cities in these two nations will have profound conse - quences well beyond their borders.

KIM During the late nineteenth century, opium was integral to European colonial rule in Southeast Asia. The taxation of opium was a major source of revenue for British and French colonizers, who also derived moral authority from imposing a tax on a peculiar vice of their non-European subjects. Yet between the 1890s and the 1940s, colonial states began to ban opium, upsetting the very foundations of overseas rule\u2014how did this happen? Empires of Vice traces the history of this dramatic reversal, revealing the colonial legacies that set the stage for the region's drug problems today. Diana Kim challenges the conventional wisdom about opium prohibition\u2014that it came about because doctors awoke to the dangers of drug addiction or that it was a response to moral crusaders\u2014uncovering a more complex story deep within the colonial bureau - cracy. Drawing on a wealth of archival evidence across Southeast Asia and Europe, she shows how prohibi - tion was made possible by the pivotal contributions of seemingly weak bureaucratic officials. Empires of Vice reveals the inner life of colo - nial bureaucracy, illuminating how European rulers reconfigured their opium-entangled foundations of governance and shaped Southeast Asia's political economy of illicit drugs and the punitive state.

In the history of science and civili - zation in China, pharmacy\u2014as a commercial enterprise and as a branch of classical medicine\u2014resists easy characterization. While China's long tradition of docu - menting the natural world through state-commissioned pharmacopeias, known as bencao , dwindled after the sixteenth century, the ubiquitous presence of Chinese pharmacy shops around the world today testifies to the vitality of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Rejecting nar - ratives of intellectual stagnation or an unchanging folk culture, He Bian argues that pharmacy's history in early modern China can best be understood as a dynamic interplay between elite and popular culture. Beginning with decentralizing trends in book culture and fiscal policy in the sixteenth century, Bian reveals pharmacy's central role in late Ming public dis - course. Fueled by factional politics in the early 1600s, amateur investigation into pharmacology reached peak popularity among the literati on the eve of the Qing conquest in the mid-seventeenth century. The eighteenth century witnessed a systematic reclassifica - tion of knowledge, as the Qing court turned away from pharmacopeia in favor of a demedicalized natural history. Throughout this time, growth in long-distance trade enabled the rise of urban pharmacy shops. Know Your Remedies makes an essential contri - bution to the study of Chinese history and the history of medicine.

The government of one of the world's largest nations was committed to fundamentally reengineering its society and economy via socialist planning while having almost no reliable statistical data about their own country. Making It Count is the history of efforts to resolve this \"crisis in counting.\" Drawing on a wealth of sources culled from China, India, and the United States, Arunabh Ghosh explores the choices made by political leaders, statisticians, academics, statistical workers, and even literary figures in attempts to know the nation through numbers. Ghosh shows that early reliance on Soviet- inspired methods of exhaustive enumeration became increasingly untenable in China by the mid-1950s. Unprecedented and unexpected exchanges with Indian statisticians followed. These developments were overtaken by the tumult of the Great Leap Forward (1958-61), when probabilistic and exhaustive methods were rejected and statistics was refashioned into an ethnographic enterprise. By acknowledging Soviet and Indian influences, Ghosh not only revises existing models of Cold War science but also globalizes wider developments in the history of statistics and data.

Calling it \"the Hobby of my old age,\" Jefferson envisions an institution dedicated to \"the illimitable freedom of the human mind.\" He infers approvingly from revolutionary movements in Europe and South America that \"the disease of liberty is catch - ing.\" Constantine S. Rafinesque addresses three public letters to Jefferson presenting archaeological research on Kentucky's Alligewi Indians, and Jefferson circulates a Nottoway-language vocabulary. Early in 1821 he cites declining health and advanced age as he turns over the management of his Monticello and Poplar Forest plan - tations to his grandson Thomas Jefferson Randolph. In discussions with trusted correspondents, Jefferson admires Jesus's morality while doubting his miracles, discusses the materiality of the soul, and shares his thoughts on Unitarianism.

I read it with pleasure.\" \u2014Martin Daunton, author of Wealth and Welfare: An Economic and Social History of Britain, 1851-1951 A major new history of the extraordinary society that has touched all aspects of British life History 143Arts and Minds How the Royal Society of Arts Changed a Nation ANTON HOWES From its beginnings in a coffee house in the mid-eighteenth century, the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce has tried to improve British life in every way imaginable. It has sought to influence how Britons work, how they are educated, the music they listen to, the food they eat, the items in their homes, and even how they remember their own history. Arts and Minds is the remarkable story of an institution unlike any other\u2014a society for the improvement of everything and anything. Drawing on exclusive access to a wealth of rare papers and artefacts from the Society's own archives, Anton Howes shows how this vibrant and singularly ambitious organisation has evolved and adapted, constantly having to reinvent itself to keep in step with changing times. The Society has served as a platform for Victorian utilitarian reformers, purchased and restored an entire village, encouraged the planting of more than sixty million trees, and sought technological alternatives to child labour. But this is more than just a story about unusual public initiatives. It is an engaging and authori - tative history of almost three centuries of social reform and com - peting visions of a better world\u2014the Society's members have been drawn from across the political spectrum, including Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, and Karl Marx. Informative and entertaining, Arts and Minds reveals how a society of public-spirited individuals tried to make their country a better place, and draws vital lessons from their triumphs and failures for all would-be reformers today.

The Political Economy of the Special Relationship challenges this popular narrative. Revealing the Anglo-American origins of financial glo - balization, Jeremy Green sheds new light on Britain's hugely significant, but often overlooked, role in remaking international capitalism alongside America. Drawing from new archival research, Green questions the conventional view of international economic history as a series of cyclical transitions among hegemonic powers. Instead, he explores the longstanding interactive role of private and pub - lic financial institutions in Britain and the United States\u2014most notably the close links between their financial markets, central banks, and monetary and fiscal policies. He shows that America's unparalleled post-WWII financial power was facilitated, and in important ways constrained, by British capitalism, as the United States often had to work with and through British politicians, officials, and bankers to achieve its vision of a liberal economic order. From the gold standard to the recent global financial crisis and beyond , The Political Economy of the Special Relationship recasts the history of global finance through the prism of Anglo-American development.

However, the study of elections has yet to produce a comprehensive account of electoral vio - lence. Drawing on cross-national datasets together with fourteen detailed case studies from around the world, Electoral Violence, Corruption, and Political Order offers a global comparative analysis of violent electoral practices since the Second World War. Sarah Birch shows that the way power is struc - tured in society largely explains why elections are at risk of violence in some contexts but not in others. Countries with high levels of corruption and weak democratic institutions are especially vulnerable to dis - ruptions of electoral peace. She examines how corrupt actors use violence to back up other forms of electoral manipulation, including vote buying and ballot stuff - ing. In addition to investigating why electoral violence takes place, Birch considers what can be done to pre - vent it in the future, arguing that electoral authority and the quality of electoral governance is more important than the formal design of electoral institutions. Delving into a deeply influential aspect of polit - ical malpractice, Electoral Violence, Corruption, and Political Order explores the circumstances in which individuals choose to employ violence as an electoral strategy.

P. JOHNSON A widespread assumption in political science and international relations is that cognitive biases\u2014quirks of the brain we all share as human beings\u2014are detrimental and responsible for policy failures, disasters, and wars. In Strategic Instincts , Dominic Johnson chal - lenges this assumption, explaining that these nonrational behaviors can actually support favorable results in international politics and contribute to political and strategic success. By studying past exam - ples, he considers the ways that cognitive biases act as \"strategic instincts,\" lending a competitive edge in policy decisions, especially under conditions of unpredictability and imperfect information. Drawing from evolutionary theory and behavioral sciences, Johnson looks at three influential cognitive biases\u2014overconfidence, the fundamental attribution error, and in-group/out-group bias. He then examines the advantageous as well as the detrimental effects of these biases through historical case studies of the American Revolution, the Munich Crisis, and the Pacific campaign in World War II. He acknowledges the dark side of biases\u2014when confidence becomes hubris, when attribution errors become paranoia, and when group bias becomes prejudice. Ultimately, Johnson makes a case for a more nuanced understanding of the causes and consequences of cognitive biases and argues that in the complex world of interna - tional relations, strategic instincts can, in the right context, guide better performance. Strategic Instincts suggests that an evolutionary perspective offers the crucial next step in bringing psychological insights to bear on foundational questions in international politics. Dominic D.

Why has neoliberalism remained so resilient? What is the relationship between this resiliency and the back - sliding of Western democracy? Can democracy survive an increasingly authoritarian neoliberal capitalism? Neoliberal Resilience answers these questions by bringing the developing world's recent history to the forefront of our thinking about democratic capital - ism's future. Looking at four decades of change in four countries once considered to be leading examples of effective neoliberal policy in Latin America and Eastern Europe\u2014Argentina, Chile, Estonia, and Poland\u2014 Aldo Madariaga examines the domestic actors and institutions responsible for defending neoliberalism. Delving into neoliberalism's political power, Madariaga demonstrates that it is strongest in countries where traditional democratic principles have been slowly and purposefully weakened. He identifies three mechanisms through which coalitions of political, institutional, and financial forces have propagated neoliberalism's success. Reflecting on today's most pressing issues, including the influence of increasing austerity measures and the rise of populism, Neoliberal Resilience investigates the tensions between neoliberal - ism's longevity and democracy's gradual decline.

INMAN & DANIEL L. RUBINFELD Around the world, federalism has emerged as the system of choice for nascent republics and estab - lished nations alike. In this book, leading scholars and governmental advisers Robert Inman and Daniel Rubinfeld consider the most promising forms of federal governance and the most effective path to enacting federal policies. The result is an essential guide to federalism, its principles, its applications, and its potential to enhance democratic governance. Drawing on the latest work from economics, political science, and law, Inman and Rubinfeld assess different models of federalism and their relative abilities to promote economic efficiency, encourage the participation of citizens, and protect individual liberties. Under the right conditions, the authors argue, a federal democracy\u2014including a national legislature with locally elected representa - tives\u2014can best achieve these goals. Because a stable union between the national and local governments is key, Inman and Rubinfeld also propose an innovative method for evaluating new federal laws and their possible impact on state and local governments. Interdisciplinary in approach, Democratic Federalism brims with applicable policy ideas and comparative case studies of global significance. Robert P. Inman is the Richard K.

CACIOPPO Humans, like many other animals, are a highly social species. But how do our biological systems implement social behaviors, and how do these processes shape the brain and biology? Spanning multiple disciplines, Introduction to Social Neuroscience seeks to engage students and scholars alike in exploring the effects of the brain's perceived connections with others. This wide-ranging textbook provides a quintessential foundation for comprehending the psychological, neural, hormonal, cellular, and genomic mechanisms underlying such varied social processes as loneliness, empathy, theory-of-mind, trust, and cooperation. Stephanie and John Cacioppo posit that our brain is our main social organ. They show how the same objective relationship can be perceived as friendly or threatening depending on the mental states of the individuals involved in that relationship. They present exercises and evidence-based findings readers can put into practice to better understand the neural roots of the social brain and the cognitive and health implications of a dysfunctional social brain. This textbook's distinctive features include the inte - gration of human and animal studies, clinical cases from medicine, multilevel analyses of topics from genes to societies, and a variety of methodologies.

HARVEY Ecologists now recognize that the dynamics of pop - ulations, communities, and ecosystems are strongly affected by adaptive individual behaviors. Yet until now, we have lacked effective and flexible methods for modeling such dynamics. Traditional ecological mod - els become impractical with the inclusion of behavior, and the optimization approaches of behavioral ecol - ogy cannot be used when future conditions are unpre - dictable due to feedbacks from the behavior of other individuals. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to state- and prediction-based theory, or SPT, a powerful new approach to modeling trade-off behaviors in contexts such as individual-based pop - ulation models where feedbacks and variability make optimization impossible. Modeling Populations of Adaptive Individuals features a wealth of examples that range from highly simplified behavior models to complex population models in which individuals make adaptive trade-off decisions about habitat and activity selection in highly heterogeneous environments. The resulting mod - els are realistic, testable, adaptable, and invaluable for answering fundamental questions in ecology and forecasting ecological outcomes of real-world scenarios. Steven F.

BROCCOLI Syukuro Manabe is perhaps the leading pioneer of modern climate modeling. Beyond Global Warming is his compelling firsthand account of how the scientific community came to understand the human causes of climate change, and how numerical models using the world's most powerful computers have been instru - mental to these vital discoveries. Joined by atmospheric scientist Anthony Broccoli, Manabe shows how climate models have been used as virtual laboratories for examining the complex planetary interactions of atmosphere, ocean, and land. Manabe and Broccoli use these studies as the basis for a broader discussion of human-induced global warming\u2014and what the future may hold for a warming planet. They tell the stories of early trailblazers such as Svante Arrhenius, the legendary Swedish scientist who created the first climate model of Earth more than a century ago, and they provide rare insights into Manabe's own groundbreaking work over the past five decades. Expertly walking readers through key breakthroughs, they explain why increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide has caused temperatures to rise in the troposphere yet fall in the stratosphere, why the warming of the planet's surface differs by hemisphere, why drought is becoming more frequent in arid regions despite the global increase in precipitation, and much more.

To that end, cells have an arsenal of signaling molecules linked together in signaling pathways, which switch between inactive and active conformations. The Molecular Switch articulates a biophysical perspective on signaling, showing how allostery\u2014a powerful explanation of how molecules function across all biological domains\u2014can be reformulated using equilibrium statistical mechan - ics, applied to diverse biological systems exhibiting switching behaviors, and successfully unify seemingly unrelated phenomena. Rob Phillips weaves together allostery and sta - tistical mechanics via a series of biological vignettes, each of which showcases an important biological question and accompanying physical analysis. Beginning with the study of ligand-gated ion chan - nels and their role in problems ranging from muscle action to vision, Phillips then undertakes increasingly sophisticated case studies, from bacterial chemo - taxis and quorum sensing to hemoglobin and its role in mammalian physiology. He looks at G-protein coupled receptors as well as the role of allosteric molecules in gene regulation. Phillips concludes by surveying problems in biological fidelity and offering a speculative chapter on the relationship between allostery and biological Maxwell demons.

PEEBLES Modern cosmology began a century ago with Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity and his notion of a homogenous, phil - osophically satisfying cosmos. Cosmology's Century is the story of how generations of scientists built on these thoughts and many new measurements to arrive at a well-tested physical theory of the struc - ture and evolution of our expanding universe. In this landmark book, one of the world's most esteemed the - oretical cosmologists offers an unparalleled personal perspective on how the field developed. P. James E. Peebles was at the forefront of many of the greatest discoveries of the past century, making funda - mental contributions to our understanding of the presence of helium and microwave radiation from the hot big bang, the measures of the distribution and motion of ordinary matter, and the new kind of dark matter that allows us to make sense of these results. Taking readers from the field's beginnings, Peebles describes how scientists working in independent directions found themselves converging on a theory of cosmic evolution interesting enough to warrant the rigorous testing it passes so well. He explores the major advances\u2014some inspired by remarkable insights or perhaps just lucky guesses\u2014as well as the wrong turns taken and the roads not explored. He shares recollections from major players in this story and provides a rare, inside look at how natural science is really done. A monumental work, Cosmology's Century also emphasizes where the present theory is incomplete, suggesting exciting direc - tions for continuing research. P. James E. Peebles is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and the author of Principles of Physical Cosmology , Quantum Mechanics , and Physical Cosmology (all Princeton). He is the Albert Einstein Professor of Science Emeritus in the Department of Physics at Princeton University.

Peebles: Mathematics 151Arnold Diffusion for Smooth Systems of Two-and-a-Half Degrees of Freedom VADIM KALOSHIN & KE ZHANG Arnold diffusion, which concerns the appearance of chaos in classical mechanics, is one of the most important problems in the fields of dynamical systems and mathematical physics. Since it was discovered by Vladimir Arnold in 1963, it has attracted the efforts of some of the most prominent research - ers in mathematics. The question is whether a typical perturbation of a particular system will result in chaotic or unstable dynamical phenomena. In this groundbreaking book, Vadim Kaloshin and Ke Zhang provide the first complete proof of Arnold diffusion, demonstrating that that there is topological instability for typical perturbations of five-dimensional integra - ble systems (two-and-a-half degrees of freedom). This proof realizes a plan John Mather announced in 2003 but was unable to complete before his death. Kaloshin and Zhang follow Mather's strat - egy but emphasize a more Hamiltonian approach, tying together normal forms theory, hyperbolic theory, Mather theory, and weak KAM theory. Offering a complete, clean, and modern explanation of the steps involved in the proof, and a clear account of back - ground material, this book is designed to be acces - sible to students as well as researchers. The result is a critical contribution to mathematical physics and dynamical systems, especially Hamiltonian systems. Vadim Kaloshin is the Michael Brin Chair in Mathe - matics at the University of Maryland, College Park. Ke Zhang is associate professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto.

In 2014, leading mathematician Peter Scholze delivered a series of lectures at the University of California, Berkeley, on new ideas in the theory of p-adic geom - etry. Building on his discovery of perfectoid spaces, Scholze introduced the concept of \"diamonds,\" which are to perfectoid spaces what algebraic spaces are to schemes. The introduction of diamonds, along with the development of a mixed-characteristic shtuka, set the stage for a critical advance in the discipline. In this book, Peter Scholze and Jared Weinstein show that the moduli space of mixed-characteristic shtukas is a diamond, raising the possibility of using the cohomology of such spaces to attack the Langlands conjectures for a reductive group over a p-adic field. This book follows the informal style of the orig - inal Berkeley lectures, with one chapter per lecture. It explores p-adic and perfectoid spaces before laying out the newer theory of shtukas and their moduli spaces. Points of contact with other threads of the subject, including p-divisible groups, p-adic Hodge theory, and Rapoport-Zink spaces, are thoroughly explained. Berkeley Lectures on p-adic Geometry will be a useful resource for students and scholars work - ing in arithmetic geometry and number theory. Peter Scholze is a professor at the University of Bonn and director of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics. Jared Weinstein is associate professor of mathematics at Boston University.

The field has developed growing connections in diverse areas of mathematics, with applications suitable to topology, group theory, and other subfields. In A Hierarchy of Turing Degrees , Rod Downey and Noam Greenberg introduce a new hierarchy that allows them to classify the combinatorics of con - structions from many areas of computability theory, including algorithmic randomness, Turing degrees, effectively closed sets, and effective structure theory. This unifying hierarchy gives rise to new natural defin - ability results for Turing degree classes, demonstrat - ing how dynamic constructions become reflected in definability. Downey and Greenberg present numer - ous construction techniques involving high-level nonuniform arguments, and their self-contained work is appropriate for graduate students and researchers. Blending traditional and modern research results in computability theory, A Hierarchy of Turing Degrees establishes novel directions in the field. Rod Downey and Noam Greenberg are professors of mathematics at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. Annals of Mathematics Studies Sun-Yung Alice Chang and Phillip A.

PAULS & DAN ROCKMORE The analysis of complex systems\u2014from financial markets and voting patterns to ecosystems and food webs\u2014can be daunting for newcomers to the subject, in part because existing methods often require exper - tise across multiple disciplines. This book shows how a single technique\u2014the partition decoupling method\u2014can serve as a useful first step for modeling and analyzing complex systems data. Accessible to a broad range of backgrounds and widely applicable to complex systems represented as high-dimensional or network data, this powerful methodology draws on core concepts in network modeling and analysis, cluster analysis, and a range of techniques for dimen - sion reduction. The book explains these and other essential concepts and provides several real-world examples to illustrate how a data-driven approach can illuminate complex systems. u Provides a comprehensive introduction to modeling and analysis of complex systems with minimal mathematical prerequisites u Focuses on a single technique, thereby providing an easy entry point to the subject u Explains analytic techniques using actual data from the social sciences Greg Leibon is chief technology officer and cofounder of Coherent Path.

Through an accessible analysis of fundamental problems of hypothesis testing and sig - nal recovery, Anatoli Juditsky and Arkadi Nemirovski show how convex optimization theory can be used to devise and analyze near-optimal statistical inferences. Statistical Inference via Convex Optimization is an essential resource for optimization specialists who are new to statistics and its applications, and for data scientists who want to improve their optimization methods. Juditsky and Nemirovski provide the first systematic treatment of the statistical techniques that have arisen from advances in the theory of optimi - zation. They focus on four well-known statistical problems\u2014sparse recovery, hypothesis testing, and recovery from indirect observations of both signals and functions of signals\u2014demonstrating how they can be solved more efficiently as convex optimization problems. The emphasis throughout is on achieving the best possible statistical performance.

Over the past sixty years, predictor feedback has been a key tool for compensating such delays, but conventional predictor feedback algorithms assume that the delays and other parameters of a given sys - tem are known. When incorrect parameter values are used in the predictor, the resulting controller may be as destabilizing as without the delay compensation. Delay-Adaptive Linear Control develops adaptive predictor feedback algorithms equipped with online estimators of unknown delays and other parameters. Such estimators are designed as nonlinear differential equations, which dynamically adjust the parameters of the predictor. The design and analysis of the adap - tive predictors involves a Lyapunov stability study of systems whose dimension is infinite, because of the delays, and nonlinear, because of the parameter estimators. This comprehensive book solves adaptive delay compensation problems for systems with single and multiple inputs/outputs, unknown and distinct delays in different input channels, unknown delay kernels, unknown plant parameters, unmeasurable finite-dimensional plant states, and unmeasurable infinite-dimensional actuator states.
