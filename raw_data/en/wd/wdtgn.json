(See Genesis 9:5,6)Innocent blood '40 years. 6.7 million abortions. Timefor change!' 1This strap line brings together churches, professional bodies and pro-life organisations to mark on Saturday 27 October the 40th anniversary of the passing of the 1967 Abortion Act. 6.7 million abortions. The numbers are staggering: more than the number of Jews who died in the Nazi holocaust. 420,000 Dunblanes.2 270,000 classrooms. 67 Wembleys. Over 10 millionBritish citizens lost - many of the dead would now be parents! Britain has amongst the most liberalabortion practice in the western world. One in three women has an abortion. One in four pregnancies ends in abortion: one abortion every 2 minutes and40 seconds, 600 per day, 200,000 per year. There is now growing evidence that public (and parliamentary) opinion, especially on late abortion,is changing. 3Why? High resolution ultrasound videos; media stories of babies born alive following 'botched' abortions; doctors being forced againsttheir conscience to refer women for abortion; reports of late abortions flouting the existing law; testimonies from women damaged or coerced intohaving abortions; the growing evidence in the medical literature of the links between abortion and mental illness, prematurity and (possibly)breast cancer; the sheer volume of spilt blood.People are beginning to wake up to reality. Abortion is an inevitable consequence of sexual immorality, the breakdown of the family, and thedesire for a life unencumbered by dependents. But it is against the Hippocratic Oath, against the Declaration of Geneva, against the historicalposition of the British Medical Association. 4And yet as a profession we are up to our necks in it. 6.7 million lives taken by British doctors and theBMA wants to liberalise the law even further. 5 What does God think? 'Y ou created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb...when I was made in the secret place...your eyes saw my unformed body' writes the Psalmist. 6God hates 'hands that shed blood' warns the writer of Proverbs.7God 'hides his eyes' from those whose 'hands are full of blood'.8 He will demand 'an accounting'.9He was 'not willing to forgive' Manasseh who 'shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end toend'. 10Scripture links sexual immorality and the killing of children to idolatry;11they are sympto-matic of a nation which has turned its back on God. By contrast God calls his people to 'rescue thosebeing led away to death' 12and to 'speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves'.13 How then does God view us as Christian doctors; keeping silent; playing it safe; embarrassed by those who dare to speak out; rationalising ourinvolvement in the 'difficult cases'; perhaps even oiling the abortion machinery and participating in the killing? We can be certain that God will bring justice. Judgment will come. Innocent blood will be paid for. And yet God, the supreme judge, is also theGod of mercy and grace who withholds judgmentto give people a chance to repent, who grants us forgiveness that we do not deserve, who sends his own son to have his innocent blood shed by evilmen in order to pay the price for our sin. Judgment falls on Christ the innocent rather than upon us the guilty. 14 And in response to this mercy and grace he calls us to follow him by carrying his cross and embracing lives of love and obedience: risking the contempt of the politically correct by being advocates for the unborn child; bearing the cost of providing compassionate alternatives to abortionfor those who will accept them; being part of the solution rather than part of the problem. This edition of Triple Helix is devoted to vulnerable children both born and unborn. Thisautumn we have probably the best opportunity in 40 years to change things; to reflect, repent and reorder our priorities; to speak out; to be advocatesfor the voiceless; to offer women in crisis something other than a curette; to tell the truth about the consequences of abortion for children, women and society. God's word reminds us that righteousness exalts a nation. 15And warnings of judgment always come with promises of restoration and hope - provided we respond to God's call. The choice is ours. If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turnfrom their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.

Pro-choice MPs havepledged to liberalise the law 1and intend to mark the Act's 40th anniversary on 27October with a push to bring in 'abortion on request' (along with nurse and homeabortion) in the first trimester. This agenda is being supported by the national coalition Abortion Rights, 2which works closely with the Parliamentary All PartyPro-choice and Sexual Health group 3and the Voice for Choice4coalition of major abortion providers. It already has support from theBritish Medical Association (BMA), 5whose Medical Ethics Committee fully supports itsagenda. 6This movement is well organised and well funded and, even if this autumn'sinitiative fails, there will be continuing pressure to change the law during the lifetime of the present Parliament. The BMA at its annual representative meeting on 27 June passed by a margin of 67-33% a motion asking for abortion ondemand in the first trimester (ie on the basis of informed consent only). 7Further motions allowing trained nurses and midwives toperform abortions, and relaxing rules on approved premises (ie allowing medical abortions in GP surgeries and at home) werelost by 41-59% and 46-54% respectively. 8 Concerns about safety guided those present,in a debate that never considered ethics. It isalready BMA polic y to extend the Abortion Act to Northern Ireland. In the week prior to the debate an online petition, calling on theBMA to reject its Ethics Committee proposalsand instead to mount a properly evidence- based review that involved full consultation with its members and all frontline doctors,was signed by over 13,000 people including over 950 BMA members. 9 The first stage of the coming parliamentary battle is a government consultation10being carried out by the House of CommonsScience and Technology Committee into scientific developments relating to the Abortion Act 1967. Written submissions haveclosed and oral evidence sessions havecommenced. The findings will inform the later parliamentary debate.CMF's submission, which we are seeking permission to make public, provides data on improving survival of neonates born at 23 and 24 weeks' gestation and marshals thelatest evidence on the well established links between abortion and premature delivery and abortion and mental health. CMF hasalso played a lead role in forming Time forChange, a new coalition of church, profes- sional and pro-life groups seeking to tighten the existing law. 11Let us each ask God what part we ourselves should play. 1. politics.guardian.co.uk/northernirelandassembly/ story/0,,2099675,00.html 2. www.abortionrights.org.uk www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/ www.timeforchange.org.uk The first set of doctors to commence run-throughtraining started work in August. Many others though face an uncertain future. MMC and MTAShave taken many casualties but the full extentis yet to be known - round two of appoint- ments continues through to November. The government has released 1000 more trainingjobs for appointment after that date but eligibility for these jobs involves having been interviewed but not appointed in round two. Back in May, unsupported by the BMA, Remedy UK launched an unsuccessful judicial review, challenging the legality of MTAS and MMC - the resulting disappointment amongst junior doctors was palpable. The presiding judge did however describe MTAS as a 'dreadful mess' andsuggested that individual cases should be open to scrutiny by employment tribunals. The final report of the MMC Review Groupexpressed concern that large numbers ofBritish graduates will be unable to find training places in the future. 1An independent review of the process forspecialty posts, chaired by Professor Tooke, is due to report in December. Promises abound, but integrity is often in short supply. During round two we are seeing stealth advertising with job applications posted and taken off the internet over a weekend. It is difficult toknow whether the Department of Health's promise - that no junior in a substantive post would not be recruited - has been honouredas the BMA has not received co-operation in trying to assess this. Juniors are complaining to the BMA that NHS trusts are trying to getout of paying relocation fees. There have been senior casualties too. March saw resignations by both Sir Alan Crockard and Professor Heard, as MMCNational Director and National Clinical Advisor respectively. James Johnson resigned as Chair of the BMA in May after juniorswere slighted by his pro-MMC letter. Sir Liam Donaldson continues to face calls fromsenior BMA officials for his resignation. 2 Patricia Hewitt's demise as Health Secretaryis seen by many as directly related to theissue of MMC. This issue affects us all, seniors as well as juniors. We all need to act. Back in the springI talked about affirming God's sovereignty,prayer, giving and taking advice and the need to fight for justice. 3Are you in a position of real influence within your royal college? Doyou know juniors in need of support and prayer? Join a pressure group. Invite a junior round for dinner. Raise conversation withyour colleagues.

(CMF gave both written and oral evidence. 2) The committee published its findings in July.3,4It seems clear they did not think the public either knew about the issues in the bill or felt strongly aboutthem. They certainly did not feel there had been any public outcry against the contents. Christian Concern for our Nationhas produced a short downloadable video, ideal for communicating with church groups and the general public. 5 Although the report contains some positive recommendations (such as abandoning the proposal to have a singlebody regulating both human tissue and embryology), there are also some very concerning issues. The bill constitutes acomplete review of the law surrounding fertility treatment and embryology and, although the report did not consider it,abortion law will no doubt be debatedduring the bill's passage. The committee noted the bill had no foundational ethical principles and recom-mended Parliament should establish an ethical framework within it. Any such framework must recognise the specialstatus of the human embryo as an entity worthy of greater protection. The committee recognised that creating inter-species embryos was contentious,could not reach a consensus, and recom- mended the issue be put to a free vote in both houses. However, the HumanFertilisation Embryology Authority announced in September that they believe they can legally consider licensing applica-tions to create animal-human hybrid embryos for research purposes, 6a move which clearly usurps the democratic process. One of the most controversial parts of the draft bill was the removal of the requirement to consider a child's need for afather when considering the child's welfare in an IVF application. The committee recommended this too be put to a free votein both houses, but this good news istempered by the suggestion that the 'father' role could be filled by a person of either sex. The possibility that abortion law might be liberalised on the back of this bill threatens human life itself, creating inter-species embryos threatens human dignity, and various proposals strike at the veryheart of our understanding of family struc- tures. It is imperative that, when this billcomes before Parliament in the autumn, members of both houses know that people do care very deeply about these issues. 1. www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/ Publications/PublicationsLegislation/DH_074718 2. index.php 6. news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6978384.stm Shortly after the failed terrorist bombings in London and Glasgow at the end of Junecame a reliable report that an al-Qaeda leader in Iraq had earlier boasted that his group was going to attack UKtargets, and that 'those who cure you will kill you'. 1The original eight suspects were all young, Muslim, connected to the medical profession, and had come to Britain fromJordan, Iraq, other Middle Eastern countries and India. This particular story rapidly faded from the headlines, but the future securityconsequences are likely to make life even more difficult for overseas doctors. Completely unrelated to these planned atrocities, the General Medical Council hasbeen holding a consultation on its draft guidance on Personal Beliefs and Medical Practice . 2It has advised that 'doctors may need to set aside personal and culturalpreferences to provide effective patientcare' and BMA News illustrated its notice of the consultation with a picture of an Islamic woman's face and the suggestion that face coverings might have to be removed to facilitate effective communi-cation with patients. 3CMF is making a corporate submission on this draft guidance suggesting that while it isconstructive and generally uncontroversial it does raise questions of future interpre- tation, particularly about conscientiousobjection issues. T urning away from questions of faith, though not necessarily abandoning itslanguage, the British Medical Journal has been running a lively debate about whether there is a conspiracy between government and media to criticise doctors.InWhy this unholy trinity? an editor suggested there is; 4Professor Roger Jones countered from surveys of patient concerns that between 14-17% of patients withrecent direct medical contact had reserva-tions or negative opinions about thecompetence of doctors; 5and the BMA head of Health Policy and Economic Research reaffirmed that annual surveysshow 90% or so of the population trusts doctors to tell the truth, higher than for any other profession. 6 'Trust me, I'm a doctor' may occasionally evoke hollow laughter, but it seems most patients do. Let us all strive to make 'Trustme, I'm a Christian doctor' even more credible. 1. www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article 2023024.ece 2. gmc.e-consultation.net/beliefs/consultation%20 draft.pdf BMA Editor's choice.

The Bible contains a lot of wisdom for us about how to run our families. The author, a retired paediatrician, reviews the Bible'sguidance on various familialrelationships: between parents and children, adult children and elderly parents, and husband and wife. She dispenses wise advice on child discipline and boundary setting, and discusses the challenges of caring for teenagers.Jesus prayed that his people would be protected from the evil one while stillliving in the world. 1Nowhere is this protection more needed than in the area of family life. In many ways, there is now a war on for the family. Alarming statistics and consequences are coming out of widespread family breakdownand, as a lot of what one learns about being amarriage partner and a parent is modelled by one's own parents, this trend does not leave room for much optimism about our society's future. God's design God's creation design was the marriage of one man to one woman and, within that committedrelationship, the procreation of children who would then be nurtured by their parents through the developmental stages of their lives. The Bibleteaches that a husband, the lover and protector, isthe head of his family; 2his wife is his helper and the bearer of new life;3and children are under their parents' authority.4This teaching is now being regularly challenged and undermined. Add to thisthe pressure of work that can so easily erode our time, and it is easy to see how our commitment to family and church can suffer. Life becomes adifficult balancing act: we need the Holy Spirit'swisdom to know what to prioritise and when.Jesus' example Children are developing human beings whotherefore need special protection, encouragementand discipline. The Bible teaches that parents have a God-given responsibility to prepare their children to become independent adults. The gospel of Lukealludes to four dimensions of development duringJesus' childhood 5- the physical, intellectual, spiritual and social - and it is good to think carefullyabout these as we bring up our children. Godly marriages To give a child security, the husband-wiferelationship needs to be strong and so prioritisedand not neglected. 6The relationship between a child's parents will be his/her model of intimacy anda model for many of the relationships that child will make in his/her life and the way he/she will deal with the ups and downs of life. The different roles ofhusband and wife within the marriage relationshipare a wonderful example of complementarity where both are needed to make a whole. God did not design men and women to be the same... He wanted there to be a complementarity. He deliberately made men with greater physical strength - to protectand provide for others. He purposely made women with greater relational strength - to nurture and care forfamily Liz Jones reminds us of biblical priorities THE FAMILY biblical basics22398 CMF - TH Amends 8/10/07 09:48 Page 6Autumn 07 triple helix 07 others. The differences were designed to be a source of joy and satisfaction. The relationship between Christand the church is, as it were, held up by God to a wondering universe, and he proclaims that that is what he designed the relationship between husband and wifeto look like! 7 Honour your father and mother Children are to be under the authority of theirparents, 8heirs but not adults,9and the extended family are to support but not usurp the position of husband or wife. It is interesting that the commandment to honour father and mother is foundational to the second part of God's moral law. 10Honouring your father and mother may also involve caring for elderly parents. This requires wisdom and possibly sacrifice but 'it is pleasing to God'. 11 Boundaries Having authority over one's children is not a reason to be harsh. Boundaries are very important butshould be instilled with gentleness and patience and it is important we give our children much attention and much encouragement. An attentionseeking child is often an attention needing childand parents cannot give attention if they are absent or pre-occupied with 'more important' issues. Fathers are encouraged not to exasperate theirchildren but to 'bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord'. 12'Bringing up' is an active term and requires us not to neglect our children, nor to idolise and so fail to correct them. We must receive them as a gift and responsibility from God and train them in his ways and remain teachableand subject to God's word ourselves. Discipline is'guiding, educating and supervising a child's choices'. 13 Watching out The society in which our children are growing up is both unstable and stressful for them and theirparents. Civilised societies have in the past relied on an unwritten code of behaviour between children and adults both in and outside the home. Childrenwere expected to behave with respect towards theirelders and in return most adults kept an eye open for children's safety and welfare. Over the last 25 years much of this seems to have evaporated andthe goal posts are still moving; moral relativism makes child rearing very difficult. This increasing disconnection between children and adults is havingfar-reaching effects with experts linking it with young people's increased alcohol and drug abuse, violence and promiscuity. 14 We also need to ask what our own children are watching, playing and hearing in our technologyrich society. The media markets violent games at our little boys and throws tips on dieting and looking sexy at our little girls. Increasingly too, the state is stepping in between children and their parents: the current push for thecompulsory, explicit sex education of young children; and the provision of the morning after pill and abortion to girls under 16 without their parents' knowledge are examples of this. The possibility of achildren's database sharing information about every child in England could be another unwanted intrusion into family life. We must pray for ourchildren's protection in this difficult and ungodly culture, and for their regeneration. Teen troubles Parenting through the teenage years has special challenges of its own. Puberty brings many changesin a young person's life both physically and emotionally and during this time it is normal for thepeer group to assume more importance. This brings many tensions especially for Christian families, asmuch peer influence will not endorse the principles we hold dear and can be downright harmful. It is still important that parents 'hold on with an openhand' and allow a young person gradual and appropriate opportunity to function in a more independent way. Y oung people need to develop theskills to move on with confidence into the world of work or further education. They need to learn to regulate work and recreation and cope with sexualattraction, relationships and their own fertility in a mature and appropriate way. The world is a difficult place for today's teenagers to negotiate. They are faced with an excessivenumber of choices, extreme or permissive experi- ences, pressure to succeed, less protection and less family support than in past years. As ever, goodcommunication and availability are keys to positive relationships between parents and their teenagers. Make sure they know when you are pleased. It maybe necessary to verbalise the conflicts, but do so treating them with dignity and respect; do not 'wound with words'. Love is unconditional.Teenagers need to know that whatever happens,there is always a way back. Christian worldview In a post modern culture where anything goes, weneed to give our children a Christian worldview. Thesuggestion that Christians brainwash their children implies that the society we live in does notdo so: secular society has an agenda of its own. The fatherof our Old Testament scriptures, Abraham, wassingled out by God to 'direct his children and his household after him, to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just'. 15And Jesus, our Lord said, 'The thief comes only to steal and kill anddestroy' but that he had come that we 'may have life and have it to the full'. 16We need to identify the activities of the thief as he seeks to rob our familiesin so many ways. If we resist him he will flee, 17 because 'the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world'. 18 Liz Jones is a Lovewise trustee and a recently retired community paediatrician in Newcastle upon T ynefamily 1.

Children, families and society at large suffer when it goes wrong. Research has demonstrated thatpoor parenting can be improved through education. There are several proven training programmes, each tailored to different circumstances - parents' backgrounds, cultural factors, andwhether or not the children have special needs of any kind. The author, a psychiatrist, also relates her experience of setting up and running programmes within a church setting in TowerHamlets. Parenting is a complex, demanding and vital job for which there are no qualifications, no training, little support and maximum opprobrium when it goes wrong. 1 Hardly a day goes by without a news bulletin about uncontrollable ASBO kids, depressed andself-harming youngsters and violent teenagers. Why are our children in this mess, and what can we do about it? It starts with the parents Parents who form secure attachments with theirinfants will have children who are more sociallycompetent, self-confident, popular, resilient and mature. Sadly the reverse is true of insecurely attached mother-infant pairs. 2When parenting goes wrong, children suffer. Their development goes astray,resulting in emotional and behavioural difficulties. Families characterised by conflict, aggression and cold relationships have children vulnerable topsychosocial problems, substance abuse and problemswith biological stress-response regulatory systems. As well as increased risk for mental health disorders, this impacts on physical health as cardiovascular and immune system responses become over-taxed. Children become hyper-vigilant, unable to read social cues and poor at emotional self-regulation andreflection. 3 Costly mistakes Poor parenting is costly. Conduct disorder in childhoodhas a worldwide prevalence of around five percent andrising. 4,5,6If untreated, as well as being more likely toabuse substances and leave school without qualifica- tions, 40% of such adolescents will be repeatedlyconvicted of crimes. 7As adults they continue offending, have domestic violence problems, pooremployment records and fail to integrate into society. 8 Parents of such children tend to be harsh and incon-sistent, though it is less clear whether this is cause,consequence or due to shared genetic predisposition; 7 they pay attention to unwanted behaviour whilstignoring desirable behaviour. 9 By the age of 28, those who had conduct disorder at age ten were costing society ten times as much(\u00a370,019) as those with no behavioural problems (\u00a37,423) in terms of excess use of public services. 10 Help is at hand V ast amounts of research have been done to look at the effectiveness of parent training programmes in the treatment and prevention of such problems. Dretzke looked at 37 randomised controlled trials of parenting programmes for the treatment of childrenwith conduct disorder and found them to beeffective. 11The resulting review built on a large body of research and earlier reviews done on aspects of the same subject. There was evidence of long term effectiveness on children's behaviour, positive effects on other aspects of children's mental health (eg selfesteem) and on parents' wellbeing, attitudes andbehaviour. There was also some comparison of different types of parenting programme. Behavioural programmeswere most effective in modifying children's behaviour. Other approaches (eg humanistic ones) may haveeducation Sara Kundu shares her experiences PARENT training programmesPhoto: CMF - TH Amends 8/10/07 09:24 Page 8Autumn 07 triple helix 09 important benefits such as on children's self esteem. Group-based trainings were more successful thanindividual approaches. Parent training was found to be cost effective with costs per family ranging from \u00a3629 to \u00a33,839depending on the type of programme and setting. This compares favourably with the cost of dealing with individuals with conduct disorder. There was not yet enough hard evidence to prove that parent training reduces child abuse but there was evidence that it improves some outcomes associated with physically abusive parenting. Some individualstudies report success in this area. 1,12 Which course to use? IThe target group: what ages are the children? What are their diagnoses? Are you aiming toprevent or treat?

We also adapted Family Caring Trust's optional session on children's spiritual development to suit our own approach and found it an excellent opportunity toengage in respectful discussion about spiritual matters with parents who were interested. Eight years on, we now receive referrals from local GPs and health visitors and have developed a workingrelationship with the local Sure Start Centre. We now also use the Incredible Years programme for families with more severe needs. We have seen remarkablechanges in the lives of many families: parent-child relationships have blossomed, children's behaviour has improved and parents have said how much lessstressed they feel. In some, we have also seen spiritual change and growth. For us, these are very good recommendations for any church or other organisationwishing to serve its local community.

The church can and should welcome child sexual abusers who become Christians. They should be helped to control their addiction and grow in faith, but leaders shouldbe realistic about the difficulty offenders have changing their sexual beliefs. Practical tips are given and in particular, a written contract should be signed to help the offender and protect the church and its children.John is a 45 year old man recently released from prison after beingconvicted of a child sex offence. He says he has become a Christian in prison. Y our church leader asks you to consider joining agroup to help support him practically and spiritually.How can John be shown fellowship without causing uproar in the church and neighbourhood? Characteristics of child sex offenders1,2 IThere are 28,994 registered child sex offenders in England and Wales.3 IThese people have a sexual preference forchildren, usually of prepubertal or early pubertal age. IMost abusers are men. IOne in sixty men in the population over the ageof 40 has been convicted of a sexual offence. IMost victims are already known to their abusers.4 IMany child sex offenders were themselvesabused as children and experienced emotional problems. 5 IThey are often lonely people who have low self-esteem and find it hard to build adultrelationships. ISex offending is addictive; fantasy and masturbation are frequently used; cure isunlikely so it is best to aim for control. ISex offenders have entrenched, distorted belief systems that allow them to think what they do is acceptable. IThey often minimise the extent of theiroffending or may deny it entirely. IThey may blame others - for example, their ownparents, their victims' perceived promiscuity or thebehaviour of the police - to justify their actions. ISex offenders come from all backgrounds,classes and professions. ISex offenders use a process of grooming totarget their victims and may work together withother sex offenders. ISex offenders often move around from job to job and place to place, so that their activities are not easily monitored. ISex offenders are known for their resistance to change. Treatment programmes may helpcontrol their activities, but changing beliefs is much harder. ISex offenders, especially those who have served a prison sentence, may have had a conversionexperience and embraced the Christian faith. They may state wholeheartedly that they have been cured and unrealistically claim that theywill never re-offend. IThose who have embraced the Christian faithlike people to believe they are nice guys andmay try to impress others with the depth of their Christian commitment. Public protection from sex offenders John will have been placed on the Sex Offender Register as required by the Sex Offenders Act 1997paedophilia Dominic Beer reviews the evidence and makesrecommendations forrehabilitation Not my church? child 8/10/07 09:24 Page 10Autumn 07 triple helix 11 and he will have a probation officer. Offenders who pose the highest risk (2152 in 2004) are referred to a Multi-Agency Public Protection Panel (MAPPP);their cases are regularly scrutinised by senior representatives of local police, probation, prisons, housing, health and social services. In 2004, 26 mensubject to a MAPPP were charged with a further serious sexual or violent offence. 6 Sex Offender Treatment Programmes (SOTP) John will have probably have completed a Sex Offender Treatment Programme in prison. If he hasbeen assessed as having strong impulsive urges then he may also have agreed to take anti-libidinal medication such as cyproterone acetate. The standard treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). A meta-analysis of about 500 sex offenders found that CBT in groups may help reduce re-offending at twelve months. 7CBT challenges cognitive distor- tions such as 'I am fond of children; they like me; they need to know about sex; it's part of normalgrowing up to learn about sex; if I don't then someone else will; it's okay to do it if the child doesn't say no'. In CBT the therapist seeks to: 4 Ibreak down person's of the offence; Idevelop victim Ichallenge the abuser's self justification for his actions; Iaddress lifestyle issues and try to lower fears of adult intimacy so as to increase self-esteem; Imodify deviant sexual fantasies (these denote a poor prognosis); Iprevent relapse by helping abusers recognisesituations of temptation and their concomitant moods, feelings and thoughts so they candevelop preventive strategies. How can the church help rehabilitate child sex offenders? Because sex offending is addictive, John will need much encouragement to motivate him in his resolve not to offend again. The Rt Rev Richard Harrieswrote, 'the instinct of Christian compassion is to be generous, but this proper spirit needs to be tempered by the risk sex offenders pose and themanipulative strategies they use'. 2 The single most important factor predicting a successful outcome of treatment is the patient's motivation and willingness to enter into a therapeuticcontract. Motivation is always a complex mixture of the threat of external sanction from the law, the wish not to return to prison, a wish to placate a spouse or partner,an insurance policy should re-offending occur, and a genuine wish to change, both to control the fantasies and, rarely, to relinquish the fantasies in favour of a more socially acceptable sexual structure. 8 It is important to get the balance between offering fellowship and maintaining explicit bound- aries. Jesus did not condemn the woman found inadultery, but nor did he condone her behaviour. He said: 'Go now and leave your life of sin'. 9Church leaders \u2014 what to do IDraw up a contract between yourselves and John, which must be signed and enforced rigidly. It should address the following: Johnmust never work with children; must never be alone with children; must sit apart from children; must stay away from areas of thebuilding where children meet; must declinehospitality where there are children; must attenda home group where there are no children; mustattend designated meetings only. 10If the contract is broken, John should be banned from church and other church leaders, the probationofficer and the child protection officers should then be informed. See reference one for a sample contract. IEnsure, preferably through one nominatedperson, that you maintain close links with theprobation officer, with MAPPP (if appropriate),and with the local child protection officers. It is best to obtain written consent from John for this interchange, but information can be sharedwithout it. John's offending pattern, convictions, type of victim and grooming pattern all need to be known. IConsider whether to tell the church and the reaction that may occur if you do. How to manage people's anger is important, because sexoffenders are perceived as monsters. Jesus was angry at sin. 11,12Christians can be angry at sin but Paul says 'in your anger do not sin'.13 We should not condone sin but that does not mean that we cannot forgive. IProvide close practical support with accommo-dation and employment, and pastoral care to improve self-esteem and help John understandhow God views him. This might include setting up a small group to befriend and keep John accountable for his behaviour. Some find Circlesof Support, a national community support system for sex offenders, very helpful. 14,15 IImportantly, understand how John's faith is functioning. An immature faith can be a way of deflecting offenders from the reality of their offending. As his faith matures it can challenge him to face up to the responsibility of addressing his problems in a way that recognises the distress his actions cause. Conclusion Child sexual abuse is an addiction. Treatment is rarely curative. Child sexual abusers who become Christians should be helped to control theiraddiction and grow in faith. Selected people in the local church should extend the hand of fellowship to offer practical and spiritual support. A writtencontract should be signed in order to help the offender and protect the church and its children.

She describes recent scientific evidence for neuro-plasticity, and explains how the genetic blueprint (nature) interacts with the psychosocial imprint(nurture) to form the personality. Attachment failures, compounded in lone parent families, can place the young child on the pathway todelinquency. Adolescence offers a chance for recovery but structure and supervision are essential. Fatherinvolvement is a key protectivefactor. Changes in families are reviewed, the tax structure and legal framework are criticised, and thelargely negative influence of the media is considered. Properly lived out, the Christian model formarriage and family is the ideal one.How important is the family? Is there compelling scientific evidencedemonstrating its importance for mental public health? Is youth crime related to family breakdown? This article weaves together three strands of evidence. First is the research on imprinting of the psychosocial environment in the neurological devel- opment of the brain. 1Second is the data on family breakdown and the consequent impact on mentalhealth set out in the recent Social Justice Policy Group report. 2The third strand gives the perspective of a Christian child psychiatrist usingSystems Theory (the basis of family therapy) to understand how the moral values of society hold the family together and determine the welfare ofthe next generation. This thesis is set out in theCMF book Mad, Bad or Sad? 3 The Christian faith, which has shaped our family life for centuries, is no longer the dominantinfluence. The media nowadays dictates our moral code in the form of 'political correctness'. Neuroplasticity The nature/nurture debate has moved on. The genetic blueprint (nature) interacts with thepsychosocial imprint (nurture) to form the personality. The infant brain has few connections. It is like a highly sensitive photographic film. Whatever comes in repeatedly from thepsychosocial environment through the five senses gets imprinted. This process is called neuroplasticity. It 'wires up' the brain by repeated passage ofincoming stimuli 'treading out' new circuits. In infancy it programmes in the basic functions. In adolescence it remodels the brain to produce thecomplex cerebral networks for the higher cognitive functions of the adult brain. Brain imaging techniques have mapped out the components. First comes a massive overgrowth ofneurones just before and after birth, and again during puberty. This is followed by drastic pruning on a 'use it or lose it' basis. 'Neurones that fire, wire.'Unstimulated neurones die. Appropriate stimuli are expected by certain sensitive areas during specific critical periods. Some periods are very short, such as those for vision and hearing. The time scales for important psychological functions such as attachment formation and emotional regulation are longer - three years. In the first year the pre-frontal cortex 'expects' the essential psychosocial stimuli related to bonding. These come from the relationship with the mother.Breast feeding provides the right environmentfamily Elizabeth Guinness considers the complexcauses of youth crime Amends 8/10/07 12Autumn 07 triple helix 13 without any contrivance - through frequent and lengthy closeness, warmth, and eye contact. The mother picks up the baby's cues, initiating thebeginnings of communication. She responds to him joyfully, interpreting to him that it is good to be human. John Bowlby, founder of AttachmentTheory, said that a baby needs 'a besotted caretaker'. The quality of this primary attachment largely determines emotional health and future capacity to form relationships. What can go wrong? The attachment figure does not have to be the biological mother but must be a consistent one. Frequent changes of carer, such as in extensivecr\u00e8che rearing of infants, can disturb attachment. 4 The steep learning curve continues as the parents begin to socialise the child. Both warmth and authority are needed, with the setting of limits andwith harmonious family dynamics. The father's role becomes increasingly important. Consistency is vital when 'the rules for living' are being imprinted uponthe brain. Family breakdown imperils this. Lone parents find it hard to provide everything necessary single handed. Divorce tears attachments apart.Step families must forge a new family system.Multiply reconstituted families, in which the ground rules of the family keep changing, give a very confused imprint. Good genetic endowment can protect. However, in the development of criminality, genetic vulnera- bility can be exacerbated by an adverse rearingenvironment. 5For example, there is a high rate of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) in the prison population but ADD per se does not produce crimi- nality, but only when it is combined with harsh and inconsistent parenting. Good parenting with routine and structure can minimise the impact of ADD. Attachment disorder The most severe form of attachment disorder results from global stimulus neglect when the infant is left alone in a cot 24 hours a day, such as in badly runorphanages or with drug abusing mothers. The brain cannot develop properly. The Maudsley Romanian orphanage follow up study has exploredthe extent of this. However, the commonest cause of attachment disorder is maternal depression. The withdrawnmiserable mother cannot respond intuitively to her infant's cues. A severe impact can actually be demonstrated in the child's brain structure. The right frontal cortex, which is responsible forwithdrawal and aggressive reactions, becomes overdeveloped compared with the left, which deals with positive social advances. The late result of maternal depression is a well recognised preventable child psychiatric disorder, Hostile Avoidant Attachment Disorder. It places the childon the pathway to delinquency. There are now many health visitor programmes for the early detection of maternal depression. A supportive father is vital for minimising the effect on the infant. Single parents are inevitably more vulnerable. In chaotic dysfunctional families theproblem can be compounded by domestic violence.Chronic stress to the young child during the firstthree years of maximum neuroplasticity producesphysical damage to the brain from high cortisol levels as well as an imprint of trauma and confusion. This scenario is common on the bigdysfunctional inner city estates with their high crime rates. A chance to put things right Adolescence can be a chance to put things rightbecause of the second phase of intense neuroplas- ticity, when the brain is remodelled into adult form. 6 However, the time frame involved indicates the need for structure and supervision of teenagers. The initial surge in the part of the brain responsible forindependence, social bonding and sexuality occurs at the start of puberty, around the age of twelve to thirteen. The adolescent has to cope with thesestrong feelings without the cognitive controls which develop three years later in the frontal cortex. These are vital for the mature adult personality. Theyinclude the ability to inhibit inappropriatebehaviour, to perceive a situation from another person's perspective, to plan ahead, organise, contextualise, prioritise, and make judgments anddecisions. Adverse psychosocial environments can jeopardise this vital development. Confused youth takes refuge in drugs and alcohol. Father involvement is a key protective factor, giving authoritative parenting with warmth and boundaries. Gone are the customs which formerlystructured adolescence. Negotiating modern youth culture is a hazardous passage. Local communities can help by creating a subculture with more positive values with which teenagers can identify(for example, a church youth group). Changes in family structure Clearly the family is a vital part of the 'human ecosystem'. It creates the psychosocial environment to be imprinted. Yet in the UK there has been asteady erosion of family life over the past 60 years. Births outside marriage have increased from 1.5 percent in 1960 to an astonishing 43 percent in2005. Both cohabitation and solo mothering are increasing. T wenty-six percent of British children live in single parent households. Such children risktwice the rate of mental health problems comparedwith those in nuclear families. There used to be a painful stigma in illegitimacy but it had the same function as does bodily pain: it prevented furtherharm. Many factors have contributed to these changes in families: demographic shifts, birth control, socialmobility, the status of women, changes in sexualmorality and the devaluing of motherhood.However, it is disconcerting to find that both the taxstructure and the legal framework for family lawfamily 1.

Moreover, the welfare state has actually made it possible to be a single mother: the unemployed lone parent is the family model that maximises state benefits. An interesting study on marriage in men's lives finds a difference in commitment between men and women (in terms of long term view of the relationship, and willingness to sacrifice). 7 Women commit on attachment; men need formalcommitment before witnesses. Yet outcome for the children reflects involvement of the father and 40percent of cohabiting partners split up before the child is five years old. The decline in marriage suggests reluctance by men to accept this rite ofpassage to full responsible adulthood. Yet married men are healthier, happier, earn more and are less antisocial. Marriage is a support system. There are many studies into the vexed question of divorce. The legacy for the children is impaired psychological well being, reduced educational attainment, and less marital success. Although highlevels of marital conflict also harm children, surpris- ingly the harm has been found to be just as great when a low conflict partnership breaks up. 8 Media influence on social sanctions In traditional cultures religion delineated and enforced the responsibilities of family life. The World Health Organisation has warned how loss of thesesocial safeguards in rapidly changing societies imperils mental health. 9 Systems Theory is the best way of understanding how the media (among other factors) is altering the ground rules of society. Political correctness hasbecome our new morality, replacing religion. It can be defined as the unacknowledged beliefs of the suprasystem. As such it dictates what we think and what is allowed. Yet who controls it? The boundaries of socially acceptable behaviour are being pushed further awayfrom former norms in the interests of advertise-ments and drama which exploit human passions. Television scripts for soaps do not have a high moral tone; that would not be politically correct. Childrenwatch too much television and imbibe its values; indeed, a senior child psychotherapist has describedit as 'an open sewer running through the sitting room'. Browne has shown how screen violencepromotes violent behaviour in young people who have already been sensitised to violence by chaotic family backgrounds. 10Ironically, teenage violence then causes media hype! Thus the media has a twofold impact in contributing to youth crime. First it erodes family life; secondly it models violent behaviour. Moreover, the media message in general is often the opposite from that required to readjust the dysfunctional system. The bad guys win, sexualappetites are titillated, authority is questioned, and children are vaunted above parents. There needs tobe a systemic re-evaluation of the place of the media in safeguarding the human ecosystem. This will be difficult. Morality is not popular and market forces are powerful. The Christian model Consider the Christian blueprint for family life. The Ten Commandments have two family related commands: 'Honour your father and your mother'11 and 'Y ou shall not commit adultery'.12These set out the mutual responsibility between the generations and between husband and wife. The biblicalstricture limiting sex to the marriage relationship harnesses the power of the sexual instinct to energise the family. Man and wife are tocomplement each other rather than compete. This enshrines the innate differences in temperament between men and women that equip them forfamily life. Thus women are the emotionalcaregivers and men are the defenders and providers. The husband is to be the head of the family but husbands are to 'love your wives, just as Christ lovedthe church and gave himself up for her'. 13This is a high ideal that gives no place for a dictatorial husband. Indeed, his leadership must cherish andempower his wife. A woman who gives out emotionally must be replenished by her husband. Moreover, in 'systems terms' a healthy familyrequires clear leadership, not disputed power. The children need a combination of warmth and authority. The headship of the father represents the authority of society. It teaches self-control and respect.

So, instead, I will start by repeating myself1- whether or not you now have an ST number, God is still in control. That said, it is difficultto know how to respond to all that has happened over the last few months with MTAS and MMC. While we all hoped that some long lasting solution would bynow be in sight, this does not seem to be the case. Round two and beyond Round two runs until the end of October. The government will then release 1000 more training jobs: to be eligible for these, you must have beeninterviewed in round two but notappointed. Next year's application process is now being looked at by the Department of Health and a number of keyrepresentative bodies. Professor Sir John Tooke is leading an independent inquiry into MMC, to which CMF has made a corporate submission. The MMCEngland Programme Board will be making recom-mendations on MMC from 2008 onwards. These interventions should take on board the problems encountered so far. But without post expansions,particularly of ST3 numbers, it seems inevitable that many talented doctors will still find themselves out of a training career in medicine. Planning ahead All those looking to apply into next year's process need to ensure that they are attaining competencies within the jobs they are doing for the specialties theyhope to apply to. It is possible to create those oppor- tunities: one of the F1s on my team is looking to doten-day 'mini-electives' in his specialty of choice. Do you have a Plan B? Now is the time to be talking to family, friends and seniors about realistic options in and out of medicine, in and out of the UK. Not all consultants are fully up to date with the situation, so it is important to seek out wise andinformed advice. Educational supervisors, college tutors and deanery staff are good information sources. Don't give up easily on what you think you want to do but, on the other hand, don't be too inflexible. Our response CMF's Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) does not want to add to the masses of data being thrown at you. Instead we want to be a source of encour-agement. As you know, we recently attempted by email to gauge MMC's effects on you. Using the information gathered, we hope to tailor ourresponse further to meet the needs of all affected CMF juniors. At our November conference, Hope in the Midst of Mayhem, we'll be seeking encouragement fromPeter's first letter to another set of Christians under pressure, the early church. 2One of the conference seminars will be specifically looking at MMC issues and ways in which we can respond, corporately and individually. In the midst of big battles, individuals can get left by the wayside. So please, if you are in need of support and guidance, do get in touch with us. 3 We are here for you.

Despite the increasing technical skills ofmodern medicine, or maybe because of them, thereis a powerful movement from patients and profes- sionals alike to safeguard and develop this person-centred, holistic patient care. But what does it mean to help patients recognise they have 'existential' or 'spiritual' characteristicswhich are profoundly important to them as people, and may be relevant to how they handle disease and suffering?

Who is referred? Anyone, regardless of faith! The patients I see often come fromthe GPs, some from the nurses or counsellors, andabout 25 percent are self-referrals. The reasons vary. Working with the bereaved and dying is important and significant, and I see people coming to terms withchange, illness, trauma, loss, or difficult decisions. Some patients come with 'spiritual' issues - guilt, forgiveness, wanting to find God, or looking formeaning. Patients of different faiths, who already have a faith structure, are often open to receiving strength from God in different ways. What can the chaplain offer?

Many patients do not have a social network where they can be listened to and under-stood. I can offer a place of safety to be listened to without being judged or hurried. Discerning the signs of life Many come with feelings of depression, anxiety and low self worth. I encourage some patients to 'reviewthe day' - to look back over it and pick out one small moment of pleasure. Initially some report that nothing in their grey lives brought any glimmer ofjoy. Yet over a period, they may describe walking inthe park, listening to music, or cooking a meal made them aware of stirrings of life for which they could begin to give thanks. Recognising the signs of life emerging out of despondent situations, and giving thanks, is an important key to health and points to the Giver and Creator. Bringing hope It is challenging to sit with people when there areno easy answers or quick fixes. Some patients canonly understand God as cruel or, at best, disinter-ested.

These spiritual concerns included a need for love, for feeling worthwhile, andfor meaning and purpose. The GP describes extending the primary health care team to include a chaplain. Despite fundingdifficulties, the community has benefited, the primary care team and counsellors value it, andpatients appreciate it. With short histories the chaplain illustrates how she can offer listening, discern 'signs of life',bring hope, and provide significant ritual and healing prayer. She concludes that practice chaplaincyis demanding but rewarding.Photo: PA Photos22398 CMF - TH Amends 8/10/07 09:24 Page 16Autumn 07 triple helix 17 who did not protect them from being raped. I must stand with each of them in their 'Easter Saturday', atime that seems helpless and hopeless, for as long as it takes. Yet I do not do this without hope, for I believe in resurrection and new life. Over time, I have seen patients take small yet courageous steps out of despair towards healing and forgiveness. A nun commented to me once: 'God can take the s**t of our lives and turn it into manure!' I quoted this to a patient who had suffered bitter betrayal. She said, 'Y ou mean the roses can grow again!' They did. Ritual Ritual is important as a means of acting out andmaking sense of events. One Ugandan asylum seekerhad not been able to attend the funeral of her two children. I held a short service in which she said her goodbyes and this enabled her to move on in her grief. Another man, a Muslim consumed with guilt after adultery, found making his confession enabled him to move on. I encourage some to write a letter expressing their anguish to someone who has wronged them,and then to burn it. Patients describe this symbol of letting go as a significant turning point.Prayer I always ask permission to pray, explaining what I mean. Only one patient out of hundreds has declined,and she asked if I would pray for her in her absence. I pray with the 'laying on of hands', and explain this is a sign that, although we cannot see him, God is closeto us and embraces us as we are. In prayer I declare each patient's value and worth to God. So many carry negative beliefs about themselves and it is important for them to hear thetruth spoken. I often observe tears spring to their eyes at this point. I then bring their requests before God. These may be for comfort in sorrow, peace inanxiety, light in darkness, or healing in their situation. Some patients ask, when they come for a further appointment, 'Y ou will pray at the end again?' Conclusion I have found practice chaplaincy challenging,demanding and immensely rewarding. I hope therewill be many more such appointments in other practices. Anne Hughes is lay chaplain at Karis Medical Centre in Birminghamvation, for nearly 20 years. Our practice has aimed at whole person healthcare delivered by a largeprimary health care team. Having seen the teamdevelop to include practice and district nurses,health visitors, counsellors, family therapists, and aphysiotherapist, chiropodist and dietician, there was some sense of reaching this goal. However, we were aware that patients were still presenting with issueswe were not adequately addressing. Spiritual needs There existed in their lives a wide spectrum of needs,sometimes hard to define, including loneliness, loss ofconnection with any meaningful community, low self worth, and absence of a sense of purpose. Only sometimes would patients volunteer they werelooking for some spiritual answer to life's complexity,but often they felt estranged from any previous religious community. Although some of these issues could be dismissed as 'social problems', they wereclearly relevant to the patient's health and we found it helpful to use the term 'spiritual needs'. These included a need to be loved, a need to feel worthwhile, and aneed for meaning and purpose. The then primary health care team could not fully address these needs and we thought we might bedoing patients a disservice by raising awarenesswithout possessing resources to respond appropri- ately. So in 1996 the concept of extending the primary health care team to include a chaplain cameinto being. Some years on \u2014 what is the reality? IHealth service managers support but don't fundThere is clear evidence favouring professionalsseeking to be holistic, and the NHS has committeditself to addressing spiritual needs of patients and staff, so there are no grounds for resisting expanding a primary health care team to include a chaplain.However, NHS funding will always be in short supply. Initially we funded the post through fund- holding savings, later through efficiency savings, andcurrently there is no funding stream. IThe community has benefitedThe chaplain initially formed a group of localclergy who wanted to work together to address unmet needs. They established a registered charity, which has worked with the elderly,asylum seekers and families with young children.It formed a partnership with numerous community organisations allowing the birth of aSure Start programme, where it was lead body for several years. The chaplain remains closely involved with the charity and together they hold regular lunchtime meetings for Christian workersto meet and pray together. IThe primary care team and counsellors value itAll sections of the team refer patients, and there isclose liaison between counsellors and chaplain, who sometimes refer patients to each other. Patients understand that the chaplain is not there to counsel,but is able to give time to listen, reflect and offersupport for as long as is appropriate. IPatients appreciate itThe most important criterion of 'success' has to bethe experience of the individuals who have risked revealing their personal and often painful experi- ences to someone they may not have expected tofind at the doctor's surgery!

He spoke these words soon after being stoned and left for dead. Perhaps the main hardship some doctors have facedrecently (apart from MTAS) will have been the interest rate rises and higher mortgage repayments. Even as Christian doctors we may rely more on our salaries than on God. We are called to sufferhardships for the kingdom of God but we rarely do so. The day after studying this passage I was at a medical charity discussing a missionary who was struggling as the only doctor runninga Christian hospital in a Muslim area in Africa. Someone said, 'Surelypeople in CMF could go to help?' The next day the BMJ arrived with two challenging articles. The first was by Professor Chris Lavy, Ten years in Malawi: was it worth it? 1He described how, having just become a consultant and started up private practice in orthopaedics, he gave it up to go to Malawi, a country withthe same population as London but no orthopaedic surgeon. He mentioned the difficulties of reintegrating into an NHS that does not recognise work abroad. The second article, by another CMF memberworking in Afghanistan, described possible future problems in the NHS if he could not do a face-to-face appraisal. He therefore would not be able to work as a locum in the UK when on leave. 2 I was able to relate to these articles. Three years ago I returned from running a mission hospital in Uganda. I did a GP returner scheme, forwhich there is now no funding locally. It was a useful reintroduction in a safe environment to UK life. Had I returned any later I would have had to sit exams. Post-Shipman, it seems there is a knee jerk reaction to check up on everyone, even those whose time out of the NHS wasspent doing medicine. What can CMF members do? Fill gaps First, we can fill the gaps in other health systems. Statistics show the need for this.3 We might think we have staffing problems in the UK but we are still 150 times better off than Malawi. There are supposedly many unemployed junior doctors: some must be Christians who could usethis time profitably serving abroad. It would be easier health-wise for ayounger person, rather than a retired doctor, to work near the Sahara.The experience would be invaluable. A surgeon does more operating ina mission hospital than on a training scheme. This is one of the hardships we need to consider if we call ourselves Christians - to get off the career ladder and get stuck into the developing world. Do wewant to make money or make a difference? We have bought too much into the lifestyle aspirations of the western world. Lobby Secondly, we can lobby for change. Are there CMF members in highplaces in the medical establishment? I would hope so. Are they speaking up for those who work abroad or who would like to? I do notknow. Are they pushing the Royal Colleges to recognise experience abroad? And recommending doctors gain it? Can we foresee a time when CVs will be rejected if candidates have not spent time in thedeveloping world? But maybe those suggestions make us feel uncom- fortable because they mean we would have to go ourselves? Use our leave Thirdly, we can think about using our leave to do appraisals abroad,or to help a single-handed doctor get leave or administration time. As Chris Lavy wrote, this could help doctors become global citizens:'I recommend that all UK doctors spend some time in the devel- oping world so that they can ground themselves in the realities of what is happening on our planet'. Give Fourthly, if for career reasons we do not go, then instead we can always give financially. Jesus said, 'From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrustedwith much, much more will be asked'. 4When it comes to suffering hardships for the Kingdom of God, this may be the hardest. Are we willing to live simply so that others may simply live? How counter-cultural is our way of life among our affluent peers? Could we have stepped in? One day we will enter heaven and worship with every tribe, nation, colour and tongue. The people dying now because we neither went nor gave are in areas of the world where the majority would callthemselves Christian. One day we will have to look them in the face. Could we have stepped into their suffering, relieving their hardships by increasing ours just a little?

( BMJ 2007; 335:167-8) The book of Job The BMJ has a series on 'Medical Classics' and recently ran an article on the book of Job. John Launer, senior clinical lecturer atthe Tavistock Clinic, writes: 'A friend of mine, a Catholic priest, once described to me how he had to perform the funeral of a small child. He told me that there was only one way that it was possiblefor him to do it with any degree of honesty or authenticity: to offerno explanations, no pretence of understanding, no defence of his faith. Good doctors, and good counsellors, do likewise. The God of the book of Job is not the reasonable, bland God of wishfulliberals, nor the vengeful and punishing God of fundamentalists. He is as he is. That is what makes this book possibly the most challenging in the whole Bible, and the most enduring handbookfor any of us who have to deal professionally with tragedy, loss and despair.' ( BMJ 2007; 335:453) Prophets Paying tribute in the British Journal of General Practice to a deceased GP hero, Peter Toon suggests he was a 'prophet'. Thisrole he describes as 'prophesying not in the Harry Potter sense of predicting the future with uncertain accuracy, but as in the Old Testament, whose prophets denounce injustice and wrongdoing,and whose lives, speech, and writings transformed their society'.Good stuff, as is the following description of Amos, but Eutychus is less sure that ' Jeremiah's bizarre public behaviour and ranting would these days undoubtedly gain the attention of the localmental health team' and disagrees with 'we don't know what substances Ezekiel took, but they must have been pretty powerful, judging from his visions'.

( The Courier-Mail 2007; 26 July. www.news.com.au/couriermail /) Adult stem cell success By contrast, The Independent champions research led by the famous heart transplant surgeon, Professor Magdi Yacoub, wherethere are good results from stem cells taken from bone marrowbeing used to grow heart valves and muscle in the laboratory.

( The Independent 3 2007; September: www.news.independent.co.uk/health/article2921880.ece ) O tempora, o mores Eutychus can remember qualified colleagues being sent away from ward rounds for being improperly dr essed, never mind medical students, so was saddened to read in an excellent article about school students getting work experience in medicine that 'Students are advised about appropriate dress: no plungingnecklines, bare midriffs, or jeans. This area has been the source ofmore resistance and adverse comment about the scheme than any other'. And when they arrive: 'We supply ties to those who come dressed too casually and occasionally show them how to tie them'.(BMJ Careers 2007; 1 September:GP88) Care of Catholic patients A new website has been launched which aims to promote the Catholic ethos of care and to give guidance to doctors treatingCatholic patients.

( Psychosomatic This book explores the distinctives thatChristians bring to their professional practice.Starting with theological perspectives on nursing practice,personhood, health and healing, the authors explore the values and interpersonal ethics thatunderpin a consistent Christian ethic of nursing. They go on to look at how these values are worked out in practice in mental health, community and acute nursing.Vignettes explore the practicaloutworking of the theoretical sections and the authors seek to show how biblical faith shouldact as a springboard to treating patients and colleagues in adistinctively Christian manner. This is a useful book to start a serious exploration of how faith and practice intersect. However,this book raises more questions than it answers. It eschews a didactic approach for one thatexplores issues through illus-trative narratives and reflective questioning. This may be frustrating for some, but can bevery helpful in enabling us to think around the issues. While this book is squarely aimed at American nurses, it asks questions highly relevant to non- American doctors and medicalstudents as well.

Can it be me? is her autobiography, detailing alife spent serving God as a medical missionary in India and Nepal and later as apsychiatrist. Marjory stepped out in faith as a young woman fresh frommedical school and let God lead her overseas. She travelled to India and began working as anobstetrician and gynaecologist.As a female doctor, she was a rare breed on the mission field and her skills were desperatelyneeded as many women would rather die than be treated by a male doctor. Her hours werelong but she was sustained through regular prayer and continual communication withGod and other Christians. She recounts many anecdotal stories of the operations she performedand the unusual conditions thatwere rife in her population. God then called her from India to Nepal. Initially this wasdifficult for her to accept, but she went on to establish vital medical infrastructure in thecountry and was instrumental in the building of a new hospital. Her work was gruelling and there was little time for rest. During her time overseas, she became clinically depressed.Later she began to recognise the inherent stressors for Christians working in cross-cultural mission. She returned to the UK and successfully obtained her diploma inpsychiatry, a fore-runner to the modern-day MRCPsych. At the time, there wasn't any psychi-atric provision for Christian workers in India so Marjory pioneered and later directed the Nur Manzil ChristianPsychiatric Centre in Lucknow. Marjory's stamina is phenomenal. After retiring from conventional medical mission work aged 60, she stillcontinues to travel and establish mental health services for missionaries. This book isrelevant to every Christian, medical missionary or not, as it is packed full of reminders thatGod is faithful if we entrust ourlives to him. Marjory writes beautifully and Can it be me? contains many humorous stories of herexperiences. She traces thechange in mission from theforties where women had to dress in long skirts with hats to the more liberal shorts and T-shirts of the sixties andseventies! There are also many personal photographs, spanning 40 years, of the people whoselives she has touched and the places she has influenced. I was extremely encouraged byMarjory's constant praying and the delight she takes in Scripture through all adversity.Can it be me? is a lesson to us all when we face trials in our earthly lives. Liz Croton is a GP Registrar in Birmingham 'Human life beginswhen a man's spermfertilises a woman's ovum.' This is the starting point for John Ling's elegant,thoroughly researched but hardhitting book on the morning after pill (MAP). Ling reviews MAP's history and social/personal impact. Then he demonstrates how society has been brainwashed into acceptinga 'new biology' that states that, since life begins post-fertilisation, drugs such as the MAP arecontraceptives not abortifacients.Ling provides extremely useful pointers from Scripture and simple logic to refute this newbiology and the counterargu- ments that are used to defend the MAP . Finally, he suggestswhat our Christian response should be. Not everyone will like this book. Ling writes with a passionthat may be construed as confrontational. Some Christians will not agree with his definitionof the beginning of life whilstothers see the MAP as the 'lesser evil' in the abortion debate. However, this accessible bookhas a usefulness that goes beyond its subject matter and could be used as a handbook for anyone wishing to apply Christian ethics in a firm but loving manner. I stronglyrecommend it.

The British were not the first to start this outrage, but they were the first to end it. Abolition is a well presented book. Richard Reddie describes three types of African slavery:Trans-Saharan slavery, Africanindigenous Chattel slavery, and the infamous Transatlantic Triangular slave trade. Inaddition to Wilberforce, he pays tribute to the Quakers, Thomas Clarkson and Olaudah Equiano,John Newton and John Wesley. Bristol, Liverpool and London were the main Britishprofiteering seaports. Surprisingly, famousElizabethans such as Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins(who transported 1200 slaves) profited from the slave trade, asdid Queen Elizabeth I herself. The Transatlantic slave trade started in earnest under Charles II around 1662 with the devel-opment of the West Indian Colonies. Crucial dates are 1807 (the ending of transatlantic slavery),1833 (the total abolition of colonial slavery) and 1838 (final freedom from the deceptiveapprenticeship system). The book is full of little known facts and makes fascinating reading.

He was a truly great Christian, usinghis immense wealth and power to achieve his life-long mission statement: 'God has set beforeme two great objects, thesuppression of the Slave Trade and the Reformation of Manners'. Stephen Tomkinsreveals fascinating details about Wilberforce's upbringing, exposure to Methodism andeducation, and political career. I was moved by the account of his conversion and discovery of God's call on his life. His momentous perseverance - theabolition of slavery took up the rest of his life - made particularlysobering reading. Tomkins has been particularly fair whenweighing up conflicting literary evidence - Wilberforce's sons' huge biography of their father disagrees in places with otherabolitionists' accounts. This is a middleweight biography - meatier than Piper's spirituallyorientated Amazing Grace in the Life of William Wilberforce , yet lighter than Hague's incredibly referenced William Wilberforce .

Liz Walker is a GP in Farnborough Losing a parent as a teenager is devastating and these books deal sensitively with this difficult subject. They tell the story of Tony, a fifteen year old boywhose mother is dying from multiple sclerosis. His father is the local vicar and Tony has tojuggle schoolwork with nursinghis mum and fending off questions about her from concerned friends and teachers. On Eagles' Wings is set in the final weeks of his mother's life and Patterns in the Sand picks up the story one year after her death so ideally they are best read in succession.

Brought up as aChristian, he burns with anger towards the God who has taken his mum from him. Happilythough he eventually redis- covers faith. The Christian thread through both books is thoughtfully written and so would be ideal for non-Christians to read. I wouldhappily recommend them, whenappropriate, to my patients.

Working Abroad A new edition of our Short Term Mission Handbook (renamed Working Abroad ) is about to be published as hard copy and is already up on the overseas website, www.healthserve.org/pubs/ Sometimes I am asked, 'Is it safe to go abroad'? This handbook considers some of the answers to this question: There is a telling contrast between the attitudes of society today \u2014 with its emphasis on health and safety, caution and desire to have everything under control \u2014 and the attitudes of those whowent overseas in the 19th and much of the 20th century. We face risks wherever we go, it would be wrong to ignore them, but any healthcare worker overseas who wishes to identify with the peoplewho he/she serves should recognise that too much attention to their personal security could hinder their relationships. Working with refugees in a conflict zone Neil Fletcher is one such person who has just stepped out of hiscomfort zone into a dangerous and difficult situation. He has sent us his first impressions: Chad is one of the poorest countries in the world, ranked as 167th out of 176 countries in the UN Human Development Report.My mission here, working with MSF, is to bring primary medical care to the inhabitants of a refugee camp in Goz Beida, Eastern Chad. Armed conflict and insecurity in the area have hamperedrelief efforts. The camp contains thousands of internally displaced Chadians and refugees from Darfur who have fled the murderous Janjaweed of Western Sudan. These patients are amongst the most poverty stricken and disease ridden people on earth. A hundred years ago they were inaccessible as our neighbours but now, in this global village ofcyberspace, satellites and jumbo jets, they are our neighbours. And as such we must love them as we do ourselves. That doesn't just mean feeling some sentimental emotion towards them \u2014 it means helping them out of disease, poverty and suffering in whatever way we can. Mean life expectancy here is 44 years and childhood mortality is close to 25 percent. Most of these deaths are from diseases thatare simply, easily and cheaply preventable and treatable \u2014 malaria, diarrhoea, measles, malnutrition and pneumonia. The global scale of such problems equates to a death toll the size of September 11thevery two hours of every day of every year, year in, year out. Andthat is just the kids! Bin Laden may be guilty of causing death by commission. If I ignore these people then I am guilty of allowing death by omission. My role as a doctor here will have several different components. The focus of my work will be primary care and nutrition. A lot of my work will involve teaching and training the Chadian nationalstaff. I'll spend a lot of time seeing and treating patients \u2014 generally those clinical cases that are too sick or too complicated for the national staff to manage safely.
