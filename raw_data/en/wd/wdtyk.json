Incidence by episode date decreased in Interior Health and Vancouver Coastal , but increased in all other regions. From weeks 33 to 34 : Fraser Health: increased from 57 to 62 per 100K Vancouver Coastal: decrea sed from 63 to 54 per 100K Interior Health: decreased from 213 to 177 per 100K Island Health: increased from 38 to 44 per 100K Northern Health: increased from 76 to 107 per 100K Age-specific incidences are either increasing or showing early signs of stabiliz ation, except for the 10 -14-year -olds which have continued to increase since w eek 27 (3 per 100K) reaching 95 per 100K in week 34. By week 34 , the single -dose vaccination coverage in el igible 12+ year -olds was at 84% , and 76 % were fully vaccinated. Testing of MSP -funde d specimens has increased to ~53 K specimens in week 34 . Positivity of MSP -funded specimens has recently declined starting week 32 (from 9.3% to 8.9%). The weekly number of hospital admissions has been increasing from week 28 to 34, from 16 to 175 admissions. ICU admissions have decreased from week s 33 to 34 , from 54 to 43 per week . Deaths were comparable in week s 33 and 34 at 17 and 16, respectively. By case of earliest onset date, 4 new outbreaks were repo rted in care settings in week 34 . BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Wee k 34 Page 2 of 10 BELOW ARE IMPORTANT NOTES relevant to the interpretation of data displayed in this bulletin: Episode date s are defined by dates of illness onset. When those dates are unavailable, earliest laboratory date is used (collection or result date); if also unavailable, then public health care report date is used . Analyses based on episode date (or illness onset date) may better represent the timing of epidemic evolution. Episode -based tallies for r ecent weeks are expected to increase as case data, in particular onset dates, are more complete . The weekly tally by surveillance date (result date, if unavailable then report date) includes cases with illness onset date in preceding weeks. Episode dates for hospital admission, ICU, and death are defined by admission and death dates. When unavailable, surveillance date is used. As of June 15, 2021, per capita rates/incidences for year 2020 are based on Population Estimates 2020 (n= 5,139,568 for BC overal l) and for year 2021 are based on PEOPLE 2020 estimates (n= 5,197,224 for BC overall). Laboratory data include Medical Service Plan (MSP) funded (e.g. clinical diagnostic tests) and non -MSP funded (e.g. screening tests) specimens. Data sources include: health authority case line list data, laboratory PLOVER data , PHSA Provincial Immunization Registry (PIR), and hospital data (PHSA Provincial COVID19 Monitoring Solution (PCMS)). Case data were extracted on September 7 , 2021 , laboratory data on September 3, 2021 , PIR vaccine coverage date on September 3 , 2021, and PCMS hospitalization data on September 7 , 2021 . A. COVID -19 case counts and epidemic curve s Up to week 34 , 2021, there have been 166,287 cases for a cumulative incidence of 3,195 per 100K (Table 1 , Figure 1 ). The provincial incidence by episode date was 78 per 100K in week 34 , similar to weeks 32 -33. As shown by the higher incidence using surveillance date, incidence by episode date will likely increase as data become more complete. As shown in Figure 2 , incidence increased from week 33 to 34 in: Northern Health (NH) from 76 to 107 per 100K , Vancouver Island (VIHA ) from 38 to 44 per 100K , and Fraser Heath (FH) from 57 to 62 per 100K . Interior Health (IH) and Vancouver Coastal (VCH) have decreased by episode date (213 to 17 7 per 100K and 63 to 54 per 100k, respectively), but may increa se as data become more complete . Incidence increased mainly in in Northeast and Northern Interior, Fraser East , and South Vancouver Island Health Service Delivery Area s. Table 1.

Likely sources of infection As shown in Table 2 and Figure 3 , domestic contact with a known case or cluster has been the most commonly reported source of infection across the pandemic to date .

Test rates and percent positive As shown by the darker -colored bars in Figure 4 , testing of MSP -funded specimens increased from ~ 38K specimens in week 32 to ~53K specim ens in week 34 . Positivity of MSP -funded specimens declined slightly during this time (from 9.3% to 8.9%) . As shown in Figure 5 , the per capita testing rates (Panel A) and percent positivity (Panel B) for MSP -only specimens have both increased since week 32 in all HAs, with the exception of percent positivity in IH wh ich decreased from 17.5% to 15.4% from week 32 to week 34 . Most notably, percent positivity in NHA increased from 16.9 % in week 32 to 20.2% in week 34 . Figure 4.

Age profile - Testing and cases Testing rates and percent positivity by age group As shown by the bars in Figure 6 , testing rates in all ag e groups increased since week 30 , with the exception of the 80+ year - olds in which it was stable since week 32. In week 34 , the highest testing rate by far was in the 20 -39 year -olds. As shown by the black dots in Figure 6 , the percent positivity has been increasing i n all age groups since weeks 29 -32, except in the 15 -19 year -olds where it declined since week 31 . The h ighest percent positivity has consistently been in the 10 -14 year - olds, since week 32 . Case distribution and weekly incidence by age group As shown in Figure 7 , the contribution of adults 2 0-39 year -olds decreased from 63 % in week 29 to 45% of cases in week 34, while the 4 0-59 year olds increased by 8 % and the <14 years of age increased by 5% during the same period. As shown in Figure 8, age-specific incidences are either increasing or showing early si gns of stabilisation across all age groups , except for the 10 -14-year -olds which have continued to increase since week 27 (3 per 100K) reaching 95 per 100K in week 34 . In week 34 , the highest age -specific incidence ( 143 per 100K) was in 20 -29 year -olds by the 15-19-year -olds and -olds ( both at 108 per 100K ). The lowest incidence rates were in the 60+ year -olds ranging from 29 to 37 per 100K . Age-specific incidences may increase as data become more complete. Figure 6.

The 70+ year -olds were eligible between weeks 10 and 14, the 40 to 69 year - olds started in weeks 15 -19, the 20 to 39 year -olds started in weeks 19 -20, and children 12 -19 years of age started in week 20. As vaccination coverage increases, an impact on case counts is expected a few weeks later (Figure 9 ). By week 34 , the overall single -dose vaccination coverage in the e ligible 12+ year -olds reached 84% and 76 % were fully vaccinated. The single -dose coverage for age gr oups 50+ years ranged from 84 -91%, and two-dose coverage ranged from 78 - 88%, with 849 cases reported fo r those age groups combined. For younger adults, single -dose coverage in the 20 -49 year -olds was between 81-84%, and two -dose coverage ranged between 67 -76%, with 2,356 cases reported for those age groups combined.

Severe outcome counts and epi -curve The weekly number of hospital admissions has been increasing from week 28 to 34, from 16 to 175 admissions (Table 3 , Figure 10). ICU admissions have decreased from weeks 33 to 34, from 54 to 43 per week. Deaths were comparable in weeks 33 and 34 at 17 and 16, respectively. Cumulatively, there have been 17 confirmed cases of Multi -system Inflammatory Syndrome in children and adolescents (MIS - C) in BC from January 1, 2020 to week 34 in 2021, with no new cases reported since the last report. The median age of these cases is 8 (range 1 -15) years. Table 3.

Age profile, severe outcomes Table 4 displays the distribution of cases and severe outcomes. In week 34 , median age of hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths was 54 years, 54 years and 87 years, respectively, based on health authority case line lists only (data not shown). As shown in Figure 11 , death counts have been increasing in the 80+ age group from 1 death to 10 deaths reported in week s 31 to 34. Since week 23, there has been a weekly average of two deaths in the 60-69 and 80+ year -olds, and one death in the 50-59 and 70 -79-year -olds. There was a weekly average of <1 death in the entire 0 -49-year -old group since week 23.

Care facility outbreaks As shown in Table 5 and Figure 12 , 358 care facility (acute and long -term care setting) outbreaks were reported in total in BC to the end of week 34 . Since week 31, there have been 4 to 7 weekly outbreaks. In week 34 , one outbreak was declared in a long -term care facility and three in acute ca re facilit ies.
