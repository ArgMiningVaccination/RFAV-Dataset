This system is based on a natural, holistic approach to physical and mental health. Contrary to Western medical beliefs, Ayurveda practitioners believe every person is made of five basic elements found in the universe: space, air, fire, water, and earth. These elements combine in the human body to form three life forces or energies, called doshas, which control how your body works. Ayurvedic treatment includes natural products, diet, exercise, and lifestyle.Introduction to Homeopathy Homeopathy is a system of medicine based on two theories. The first is \"like cures like.\" This means that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people. The second is \"law of minimum dose.\" This is the idea that the lower the dose of the medication, the greater its effectiveness. Homeopathic products come from plants, minerals, or animals. Remedies are often made as sugar pellets to be placed under the tongue, but are also found as ointments, gels, drops, creams, and tablets. 06 Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) began in ancient China, evolving over thousands of years. TCM is based on concepts radically different from Western medicine. The most important concept is that our bodies have a vital energy flowing throughout - called Qi - and the uninterrupted movement of this energy is critical to health. TCM includes many different practices, including: Principles of Acupuncture Acupuncture, a key element of Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been widely adopted in the United States. According to a National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), over 14 million Americans had tried acupuncture as of 2017. Acupuncture involves the insertion of needles at specific points on the body, also called acupoints or meridian points. The practice helps improve the flow of Qi (life force energy) for the treatment of ailments and general well-being. Acupuncture Moxibustion (burning an herb to apply heat to acupuncture points)Chinese herbal medicine Tui na (Chinese therapeutic massage) Dietary therapyTai chi and Qi gong (Specific movements or postures, coordinated breathing, and mental focus). 07Reflexology Although reflexology does not fall under the umbrella of Traditional Chinese Medicine, it does have some similarities. Reflexologists believe there are certain points or \"reflex areas\" on the feet and hands that connect to specific organs and body parts through energy channels. By applying pressure to reflex areas, practitioners remove energy blockages and promote health in the related body area. Massage Therapy Massage therapy is another form of manual treatment. The therapist uses pressure and movement to manipulate soft tissues \u2014 muscle, connective tissue, tendons, ligaments, and skin. There are numerous forms of massage therapy, each with its own therapeutic goal. For example, cranial-sacral therapy focuses on the bones of the skull, spinal column, and sacrum. This can help alleviate the pain of TMJ (jaw pain), migraines, and back or neck pain. Nutrition and Aging Aging is a natural and beautiful process, and there are alternative medicine practices that are proven to work when it comes to aging in a healthy way, with nutrition being one of them. Through understanding the aging process, the basics of nutrition, and how they intertwine, one can better understand nutrition-related diseases, and create solutions and plans for individuals to improve their wellbeing and lead a better quality of life.Acupressure Acupressure also originated from Traditional Chinese Medicine and is based on the same principles of stimulating Qi throughout the body for health. The difference is that acupressure uses massage and firm pressure to stimulate the meridian points, whereas acupuncture uses thin needles. Although acupuncture has more applications and can treat a broader range of ailments, acupressure can be taught to clients, giving them an immediate way to manage their illness. 08Introduction to Chiropractic The Alternative Medicine program at Everglades also provides a background in chiropractic. According to the American Chiropractic Association , \"Chiropractic is a health care profession that focuses on disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the nervous system, and the effects of these disorders on general health.\" They use manual techniques called spinal manipulations or adjustments. Chiropractors most often treat neuromusculoskeletal complaints, such as back pain, neck pain, pain in the joints of the arms or legs, and headaches. The Herbal Medicine Chest As there is a growing demand for alternatives to pharmaceuticals when treating common ailments, herbal medicine has risen in popularity. An herb is a plant or a part of a plant that's used for the flavor it gives or for its therapeutic properties. Herbal medicine can come in many forms, ranging from tea to pills to topical creams. You'll learn about different types of herbs, their properties, and how they can be used to heal and provide relief from a variety of ailments. 09Detoxification and Healing Detoxification involves removing toxic substances from an individual's body. These toxins can lead to ailments and slow down a person's energy, among a variety of different effects to a person's physical and emotional wellbeing. By removing these toxins, an individual can restore their energy levels, improve digestion, and experience healthy weight loss. Through this course you'll gain an understanding about what these toxins are and how they do harm to the body, along with a variety of methods and safe solutions for detoxification. Antioxidants Antioxidants are substances that work to slow down or prevent cell damage that's caused by free radicals (which can develop as a result of inflammation, radiation, smoking, pollution, and more factors). Through a healthy diet and lifestyle, you can supply your body with antioxidants through a variety of foods, especially plant-based foods, like fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and more.
