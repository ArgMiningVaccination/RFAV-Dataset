Notes: Caveats: VAERS accepts reports of adv erse ev ents and reactions that occur following v accination. Healthcare pro viders, v accine manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to V AERS . While v ery important in monitoring v accine safet y, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a v accine caused or contributed to an adv erse ev ent or illness. The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccur ate, coincidental, or un verifiable. Most reports to V AERS are voluntary , which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically . Data from V AERS reports should alw ays be interpreted with these limitations in mind. The strengths of V AERS are that it is national in scope and can quickly pro vide an early w arning of a safet y problem with a v accine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to post -licensure v accine safet y monitoring, V AERS is designed to r apidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adv erse ev ents, also known as \"safet y signals.\" If a safet y signal is found in V AERS , further studies can be done in safet y systems such as the CDC's V accine Safet y Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safet y Assessment (CIS A) project. These systems do not ha ve the same limitations as VAERS , and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adv erse ev ents and a v accine. Key consider and limitations of V AERS data: Vaccine pro viders are encour aged to report an y clinically significant health problem following v accination to VAERS , whether or not they believ e the v accine w as the cause. Reports ma y include incomplete, inaccur ate, coincidental and un verified information. The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, sev erity, frequency , or rates of problems associated with v accines. VAERS data are limited to v accine adv erse ev ent reports receiv ed between 1990 and the most recent date for which data are a vailable. VAERS data do not represent all known safet y information for a v accine and should be interpreted in the context of other scientific information. Some items ma y have more than 1 occurrence in an y single ev ent report, such as S ymptoms, V accine Products, Manufacturers, and Ev ent Categories. If data are grouped b y any of these items, then the number in the Ev ents Reported column ma y exceed the total number of unique ev ents. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique ev ent reports will ex ceed 100% in such cases. For example, the number of S ymptoms mentioned is lik ely to ex ceed the number of ev ents reported, because man y reports include more than 1 S ymptom. When more than 1 S ymptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of S ymptoms to unique ev ents is more than 100%. More information.

About COVID19 v accines: For more information on how man y persons ha ve been v accinated in the US for COVID19 to date, see https://co vid.cdc.go v/covid-data-tr acker/#v accinations/ (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations/). One report ma y state that the patient receiv ed more than one br and of COVID-19 v accine on the same visit. This is a reporting error , but explains wh y the total number of reports ma y not equal the total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses. Help: See The V accine erse S for more information.
