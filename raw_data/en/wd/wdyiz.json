While individuals who identify as Black/African American, Latinx/Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific Islander comprise roughly 30% of the U.S. population, they are less than 15% of physicians, making them underrepresented in medicine - or URM. In fact, as the U.S. population grows more diverse, the racial and ethnic demographic gap between patients and physicians, including pediatricians, is worsening. In a bold effort to bridge that gap, a team of physicians (medical educators, advocates, and researchers) at Nationwide Children's Hospital developed a plan. The plan and its results are now published in Pediatrics.

Researchers at Nationwide Children's Hospital have recently demonstrated that an endogenous human microRNA, miR-675, inhibits DUX4 expression and protects muscles from DUX4-mediated cell death in a mouse model when administered via gene therapy. They also showed that the small molecule-based treatments that upregulate miR-675 inhibited DUX4 mRNA patients with FSHD.
