SUZANNE Spot Remover is biodegradable, non-toxic, non-hazardous, non-corrosive, non-caustic, non-flammable, hypoallergenic, and made 100% from plants and vegetables. Incredible Before and After Pictures Utilizing the Power of Nanotechnology Collodial Micelle Particles While other cleaners merely lift oils and fats off of surfaces, SUZANNE All Purpose Cleaner penetrates into dirt and oils by releasing billions of molecules that act like sand blasters, breaking these molecules into literally billions of nano-particles. These activated molecular particles penetrate and permanently break apart sticky and highly viscous materials, stopping their ability to reconnect. By keeping them from reattaching, it allows the molecular particles to further break down until they are converted into non toxic nano-emulsion. The byproduct is so harmless, it can be flushed directly into the water system without any adverse effect on the ecosystem. In fact, the size of these molecular particles qualifies as a non-hazardous zero (\"0\") U.S. Government rating.
