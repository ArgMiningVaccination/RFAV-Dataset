The working group is continually re-evaluating and refining the protocol and dosing schedule. The Foundational Supplement protocol includes: MitoCore (Ortho Molecular Products): a comprehensive multivitamin that also Manganese, and Zinc. The working group recommends 2 caps, twice daily for 90 days. OmegaGenics (Metagenics), a concentrated Omega-3 product containing 710 mg EPA and 290 mg DHA; 1,000 mg twice daily for 90 days. Magnesium Glycinate, 200 mg twice daily for 90 days Co-Enzyme Q10, 200 mg per day, for 90 days Quercetin, 500 mg, twice daily for 90 days Vitamin K2 with D3: Up to 10,000 IU daily, with specific dosing based on each patient's serum levels. If the serum level is below 40 ng/ml, use 10,000 IU. If it's within 40-60 ng/ml, use 5,000IU. If above 60 ng/ml, the patient does not need supplementation. The Specialty Supplement protocol consists of: Arterosil (Calroy Health Sciences): The main constituent in Arterosil is Rhamnan sulfate, a sulfated polysaccharide from two marine algae (Monostroma Latissium and Monostroma Nitidum). Rhamnan sulfate has a similar structure to glycosaminoglycans found in the human endothelial glycocalyx\u2014the thin gel-like layer that coats the luminal surfaces of healthy blood vessels. Glycocalyx damage is one of the earliest steps in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, and it is a common consequence of Covid. \"In order to have any hope of repairing tissue damage, we need optimized blood flow and optimized vessel health. Arterosil targets the regeneration and repair of the endothelial glycocalyx,\" said Kristine Burke, MD, a co-chair of the PVRP Working Group, during a webinar outlining the protocols. ITIS (Return Healthy): This product is a complex of anti-inflammatory Burke noted that Scutellaria produces a compound called Baikalin that is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, making the product useful for mitigating the cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and \"brain fog\" that many Long Covid patients experience. That's in addition to the product's capacity to reduce systemic inflammation, one of the main drivers of the post-viral syndrome. Tollovid (Todos Medical): This unique substance is derived from an herb called Lithospermum erthythrorhizon, known colloquially in English as Gromwell root, or Zicao in Traditional Chinese Medicine. \"Tollovid addresses persistent viral infections by blocking viral replication capacity,\" explained Dr. Burke. It does this by binding tightly to the 3CL protease, an enzyme that coronaviruses use to cleave the long polypeptide chains produced from their mRNA during the replication process. Tollovid is among a number of 3CL inhibitors being explored in the Covid context. Essentially, it shuts down the replication process. MegaSporeBiotic (Microbiome Labs): This probiotic product delivers spores from five strains of Bacillus subtilis. PVRP Working Group members believe it is ideally suited to address the marked microbiome alterations associated with Covid and sometimes, Covid vaccination. \"We want to recondition the gut and bring back a healthier microbiome, especially facilitating the resurgence of those species that are important in immune regulation,\" Burke said. Rather than \"seeding\" the gut with exogenous probiotic organisms, the goal of treatment with a spore-based product like this is to shift the microbial ecology so that it favors growth and flourishing of a patient's own endogenous bacterial species. MegaPre (Microbiome Labs): A prebiotic product containing three different types of non-digestible oligosaccharides derived from kiwi fruit, nonGMO corn cobs, and rBST-free cow's milk. Supplementation with this combination increases GI microbial diversity and selectively feeds beneficial organisms like Akkermansia muciniphilia, Faecalibacterium prauznitzii, and various species of Bifidbacteria which, Dr. Burke noted, are often decimated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. \"We found ourselves needing a curated suite of nutritional product solutions that were targeted at the five main drivers of Long Covid: ACE2 mediated microbiome/dysbiosis.\" -Kristine Burke, MD For the first 30 days, in addition to the full array of Foundational supplements, patients should take: Arterosil, 2 caps twice daily; ITIS, 2 caps thrice daily; Tollovid 3 caps 4 times per day; and MegaSpore alone (the prebiotic is added later), 1 cap daily for the first 7 days, and then 2 caps daily until the bottle is finished. From Day 30 to Day 90, patients can cut the doses to: Arterosil 1 cap twice daily; and Tollovid 1 cap twice daily for 30 days. They should eliminate the MegaSpore probiotic, replacing it with the MegaPre oligosaccharide formula, 3 caps per day. All products in the protocols are available as a bundle from Fullscript. Practitioners with Fullscript accounts can prescribe the complete protocols for patients, and Fullscript will deliver the full product suite to their homes, along with detailed implementation instructions. Dr. Burke and members of the Working Group stress that the current protocols, though based on a scientific review of hundreds of potential candidate products, are still a work in progress. The team has established a standardized registry to track outcomes in hundreds of patients now on the protocols, and they will use the data to revise the protocols if necessary. She added that these regimens are flexible. \"There may be some patients for whom we want to add some other tools not on the protocol list. You may choose to add or subtract products. But this is the broadest and simplest set of products and processes that we could develop. We're not promoting specific brands necessarily. But the ones on the list, we found data to support the use of each of them to target one or more of the five key drivers of long Covid.\" Disclosure: ANDHealth and Calroy Health Sciences are clients of OvationLab. Repair of the endothelial glycocalyx is a vital element in the restoration of cardiovascular health, according to Mark Houston, MD, director of the Hypertension Institute at Saint Thomas West Hospital, Nashville. The endothelial glycocalyx (EGX) \u2014literally \"sugar coating\" in Greek\u2014is a very thin gel-like layer that lines the luminal surface of the blood vessels. It is a carbohydrate-rich mesh of membrane-bound and soluble glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans, which create a non-adherent shield. Damage to this sensitive, bioactive layer is one of the earliest steps in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, Dr. Houston said at the 2022 Integrative Healthcare Symposium. \"Endothelial dysfunction is the starting point of CVD, and the EGX is the primary protector of the endothelium. Therefore, maintaining a healthy EGX may be one of the most important intervention targets for prevention of CVD.\" A \"SMART\" Barrier To understand the importance of the EGX keep in mind that the vascular endothelium is not passive. It actively controls passage of nutrients, oxygen, and hormones into and out of the bloodstream. It is also a key player in immunity and inflammation. Through production of nitric oxide, it regulates blood pressure. \"The endothelium affects the structure and function of every other organ system,\" Houston explained. \"Whatever the glycocalyx does, the endothelium does as well.\" According to Dr. Houston, the glycocalyx is a \"SMART\" barrier: Selective: It is selectively permeable, preventing cholesterol, platelets, leukocytes, and other circulating blood components from sticking to vessel walls, but allowing passage of nutrients, dissolved gases, and signaling molecules. Micro-thin: The thickness of the EGX varies with the thickness of the arteries it coats. It is generally in the range of 2-3 um in small vessels, and up to 4.5 um in larger ones like the carotids. Even at its thickest, it is still quite thin. It would take roughly 1,000 layers of EGX to equal the thickness of one sheet of paper. Antioxidant: The EGX harbors the antioxidative enzyme, reduces oxidative stress, nitric oxide (NO) available to the vasculature. Regulator: It regulates vascular permeability, inflammation, coagulation, and fluid The EGX contains brush-like structures in the 150-400 nm range, comprised of glycoprotein and proteoglycan chains. These sense the shear stress of blood flow, and signal the endothelium to produce nitric oxide when needed to regulate vascular tone. It also responds to chemokines, cytokines, and other molecular signals involved in vascular homeostasis. One of its primary functions is to protect the endothelium from thrombus formation. It blocks the binding of sticky leukocytes, activated platelets, and lipoproteins-especially LDL. It also contains anti-thrombin III, tissue factor pathway inhibitors, lipoprotein lipase, vascular endothelial growth factor, superoxide dismutase, and hyaluronic acid, all of which mitigate inflammation and resist thrombus formation. Negatively charged glycosaminoglycans within the EGX bind and inactivate sodium, rendering it non-osmotic and preventing it from accumulating in the endothelium. Thus, the EGX buffers against salt-induced arterial stiffness. Hyperglycemia & EGX Damage Damage to the EGX is a direct consequence of persistent hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress. It precedes all the vascular complications of diabetes. \"Endothelial dysfunction is the starting point of CVD, and the EGX is the primary protector of the endothelium. Therefore, maintaining a healthy EGX may be one of the most important intervention targets for prevention of CVD.\" Mark Houston, MD, Director, Hypertension Institute at Saint Thomas West Hospital, Nashville \"High blood glucose causes damage to glycocalyx, even in the so-called \"normal\" range. You want fasting blood sugars down to 75, and the A1c down to 5. Anything above that will increase risk because that's when the glycocalyx damage starts,\" Houston told IHS attendees. Many other things also contribute to glycocalyx degradation, including elevated TNF-a, hypervolemia, low fluid sheer stress, hyaluronidase, matrix metalloproteinases, atrial natriuretic peptide, and bacterial endotoxins. There's a clear and simple correlation between reduced EGX thickness and predisposition to lesion formation. Houston noted that in \"atheroprone\" regions of the vasculature-such as vessel branches, bifurcations, and curvatures\u2014the EGX is typically very thin. Restoring the Glycocalyx A number of treatments and factors can help to restore, regenerate, or maintain a healthy EGX, including: Hydrocortisone Calcium channel blockers Glycemic control via Metformin Sulodexide\u2014a highly purified mixture of glycosaminoglycans composed of low molecular weight heparin (80%) and dermatan (20%) Statins Reduction (SSP), and protein C But Dr. Houston holds that the single most effective and convenient option is Rhamnan sulfate (RS), a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from two types of marine algae (Monostroma Latissium and Monostroma Nitidum). These polysaccharides have similar glycosaminoglycans found in the human EGX. Rhamnan Sulfate: Safe & Effective Early in vitro experiments showed clearly that rhamnan sulfate can repair EGX damage caused by excessive glucose exposure. Animal experiments show that it prevents leukocyte adhesion, suggesting that it might prevent endothelial inflammation at its earliest stages. Rhamnan sulfate is available as a dietary supplement called Arterosil. This product also contains grape seed extract, green tea extract, and concentrated extracts from a host of heart-healthy fruits and vegetables. Supplementation with rhamnan sulfate can markedly increase arterial elasticity, a good indicator of endothelial function. In a study of 19 healthy humans at Baylor College of Medicine, daily supplementation with Arterosil increased carotid arterial elasticity by an average of 89.6% over baseline, within two hours of ingestion. \"Arteries are arteries. If it does this in the carotids, my guess is that it does it everywhere,\" said Dr. Houston. \"If you give a glycocalyx promotor, you can get increases of vascular compliance very quickly, and the functional changes beget structural changes.\" He added that he is now recommending Arterosil and other glycocalyx-promoting treatments to 100% of the patients in his clinic. \"The average increase in arterial elasticity is almost 90%, very significant improvements.\" Plaque Reversal Houston contends that conventional medicine's myopic obsession with lipids has blinded many physicians to the myriad other factors that drive vascular pathology. \"Even if you use statins and drive down LDL to 40, still 50% of patients will have events. Lipids are not the only problem in CAD. There are many other steps.\" That said, new evidence indicates that rhamnan sulfate can reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation, at least in mice. Notably, the plaque-reducing and anti-inflammatory effects were stronger in female versus male animals. Dr. Houston reported early data from an ongoing human pilot study of rhamnan sulfate in patients with vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, as confirmed by MRI-PlaqueView imaging. PlaqueView is the only FDA-approved software system for carotid plaque analysis. He pointed out that stenotic plaques account for less than 50% of all \"culprit\" lesions, whereas 75% of all events are attributable to ruptured non-stenotic plaques that trigger thrombus formation. Daily supplementation with a rhamnan sulfate product for two months led to a mean 64% regression of lipid-rich necrotic plaque\u2014the most dangerous type of plaque\u2014in the female participants, and a 47% regression in the males. There were also significant increases in vessel lumen diameter, suggesting a reduction of carotid stenosis\u2014a finding that has not been observed in statin studies. \"Rhamnan sulfate changes the morphology of plaques, making them more stable. These are very significant changes. Nothing else does this. No drug can do this. Statins reduce lipid-rich necrotic plaques by about 25%, which is meaningful, but not even close to what you get with the Rhamnan sulfate.\" These preliminary findings from China, have prompted a larger US-based study which is now underway. Houston stressed that plaque reversal is a gradual process. Typically, it takes about 6 months of twice-daily dosing to see reversal of carotid plaques. \"For really bad cases, you can take two caps, twice daily. The key is to split the doses, ideally 12 hours apart. It works better that way.\" \"Rhamnan sulfate changes the morphology of plaques, making them more stable. These are very significant changes. Nothing else does this. No drug can do this. Statins reduce lipid-rich necrotic plaques by about 25%, which is meaningful, but not even close to what you get with the Rhamnan sulfate.\" Mark Houston, MD, Director, Hypertension Institute at Saint Thomas West Hospital, Nashville Rhamnan sulfate does not break up plaques and cause fragments to float away. Rather it promotes resorption of the lipid core while simultaneously blocking deposition of lipids. It does this without actually affecting serum lipid levels. According to Dr. Houston, Aterosil is safe, and unlikely to interact adversely with medications. In fact, it is likely to be synergistic with Rosuvastatin (Crestor) and other statins. \"There are zero drug interactions with this. In combination with nearly everything we use, the interactions are generally good. If anything, it makes the drugs more effective.\" Impact on Blood Pressure Houston and his colleagues at the St. Thomas West Hospital studied Arterosil in a cohort of ten patients with uncontrolled hypertension. After three months of twice-daily dosing, the patients showed a decrease in mean systolic pressure from 151.5 mmHg at baseline, down to 147.5 at the three-month point. Diastolic pressure dropped from a baseline mean of 93.2 down to 82.3 mmHg. His team is currently looking at the impact of this product on diabetic neuropathy in a cohort of 20 patients. He says \"preliminary results are very promising.\" Potential Role in Covid Care The glycocalyx and its restoration has implications in the context of Covid-19. A healthy EGX may reduce susceptibility to viral infection, as well as the risk of severe Covid symptoms if one does get infected. Conversely, the Covid disease process can damage the glycocalyx, Dr. Houston explained. Early on in the pandemic, investigators at the Lawson Health Research Institute, Ontario, reported that ICU patients infected with the then-novel virus showed marked glycocalyx degradation compared with ICU patients who were virus-negative. This correlated with increases in thrombosis, depressed nitric oxide production, and increased platelet adhesion (Fraser DD, et al. Crit Care Explor. 2020). \"A therapeutic strategy based on glycocalyx protection would be effective for Covid-19 patients with both early and severe (e.g., ARDS) disease.\" Hideshi Okada, MD, Gifu University, Japan A team at the Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland showed that in human pulmonary arteries, the intact EGX strongly binds viral spike protein, \"but screens its interaction with ACE2.\" When the glycocalyx is reduced, ACE2 receptors on the surface of the endothelial cells are exposed, enabling the spike proteins to bind. The Krakow group concluded that susceptibility to Covid-19 may depend on the condition of the glycocalyx. A Greek research team showed strong correlations between reduced EGX thickness, oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and impaired cardiac performance in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Dr. Houston noted that \"even in mild cases of COVID-19, EGX damage can persist for up to four months, and has been correlated with a 10-fold elevation in oxidative stress compared to controls. If the ACE2 enzyme is low to begin with, something like Covid, which depletes ACE2, will cause big, big problems. This is what happens in very bad cases.\" It is notable that people on ACE2-sparing drugs tend to have milder Covid cases. \"You can increase the effects of ACE2 with a glycocalyx promoter,\" Houston says. In their excellent review of vascular injury in Covid-19, Dr. Hideshi Okada and colleagues at the Gifu University, Japan, point out that the endothelial glycocalyx is already very thin in pulmonary capillaries. Further degradation following an inflammatory cascade could be a major factor in acute and long-term Covid (Okada H, et al. Microcirculation. 2020). \"A therapeutic strategy based on glycocalyx protection would be effective for Covid-19 patients with both early and severe (e.g., ARDS) disease,\" writes Okada. \"A patient with comorbidity such as diabetes or hypertension would most likely exhibit an impaired glycocalyx function. Accordingly, their endothelial cells would not be fully protected and would be more susceptible to external (or internal) pathogens. In other words, the prevention of endothelial glycocalyx injury represents a useful means of systemic defense against infection.\" Blocking Viral Entry Researchers at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute showed in cell culture experiments that rhamnan sulfate binds the spike protein binding domains on SARS-CoV-2, inhibiting interaction with ACE2 and heparan sulfate on endothelial cell surfaces. The effect of the seaweed extract was stronger than that of heparin or of pseudoviral particles being tested as potential Covid treatments. Animal experiments at Chubu University in Japan suggest that rhamnan sulfate can directly inhibit influenza virus infection, while also promoting antibody production (Terasawa M, et al. Mar Drugs. 2020). They conclude that it is a potential candidate for the treatment of influenza virus infections Emerging research is challenging the long-held belief that tissue damage following myocardial infarction is permanent and irreversible. For decades, the conventional medical view has been that damaged myocardium cannot regenerate, owing to the fact that heart cells are not as readily replaced as are other cells in the body. Several research teams around the world, including a group based at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Heart Institute, are studying the mechanisms that put the brake on myocyte regeneration. This line of inquiry suggests that the myocardium might, in fact, have regenerative capacities, opening up a whole new world of treatment approaches. That's good news, given that CVD is the still the number one cause of death in North America. Every year, over 800,000 people in the US have heart attacks. Though 90%, at least initially, long-term sequelae can be debilitating. CVD prevalence will continue to rise if present trends continue. In a recent report from the Bogalusa Heart Study, nearly one-third of young adults (32%) in their 20s and 30s already show arterial plaque formation (Razavi AC, et al. JAHA. 2021). Much of the blame for that lies with unhealthy diet and lifestyle. COVID-19 can also cause myocardial damage. Many infected people suffer from rapidly-developing blood clots, endothelial inflammation, pericarditis, and myocarditis. Inflammation of the myocardium can lead to cardiomegaly, scarring, and death. Emerging research is challenging the long-held belief that tissue damage following myocardial infarction is permanent and irreversible. This line of inquiry suggests that the myocardium might, in fact, have regenerative capacities, opening up a whole new world of treatment approaches. There are also a small but significant number of myocarditis cases\u2014usually transient\u2014in people who have received the Pfizer or Moderna COVID vaccines. This seems to be most prevalent with 18-39 year-old males, and tends to occur after the second dose. According to a recent report by Steven Gundry, MD, in the journal Circulation, the vaccines can trigger a rise in inflammation markers like IL-16, soluble Fas, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Gundry S. Circulation. 2021). COVID long-haul patients are also drawing renewed attention to the issue of myocardial damage, since so many experience chronic heart problems. After treating long COVID sufferers for over fifteen months, it became clear to me that while most could achieve a general recovery from COVID via intensive nutrition and lifestyle-based protocols, roughly 50% need extra help resolving the cardiovascular problems. As I dug deeper into the medical literature I discovered research about nutraceuticals that show promise for helping COVID long-haulers to recover faster and better. Many of these nutrients and herbs may also help regenerate myocardium and improve cardiovascular function in people with non-COVID myocardial damage. Vitamin C: Vitamin C is crucial to the production of collagens, the most abundant proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM), and therefore the most abundant proteins in the body. The ECM has a fibrillar structure that provides a framework for tissue/organ morphogenesis, as well as for regeneration after injury. Vitamin C impacts ECM homeostasis by regulating collagen synthesis and maturation. It is also an antioxidant, able to prevent damage caused by free radicals. In the cardiovascular context, vitamin C's antioxidant capacity may mitigate endothelial damage following a heart attack or a viral infection such as COVID-19. Vitamin C is also influential as a co-factor in many enzymatic reactions that determine how stem cells differentiate during tissue repair. It therefore plays an important role in both the production of myocardial cells, and in cellular repair and replacement (D'Aniello C, et al. Stem Cells Intl. 2017). Vitamin D3:The roles of vitamin D3 in bone health, genetic expression, antiviral protection, and cancer prevention/treatment are well known. Less well known is the impact it has on cellular repair, especially cells in the heart and circulatory system. The endothelium is an active organ, not simply an inert lining which allowed water and electrolytes to pass through. One of its key functions is the maintenance of nitric oxide levels. Vitamin D3 plays a central role in that process, by increasing cytoprotective nitric oxide (NO) while reducing peroxynitrite\u2014an unstable nitrate isomer that can cause considerable oxidative damage. This favorable rebalancing allows endothelial cells to be repaired more rapidly. Experiments using human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures showed that vitamin D3 could effectively restore healthy NO/peroxynitrite balance in tissue perturbed by angiotensin-II. The authors conclude that \"vitamin D3-stimulated improvement of endothelial function may directly benefit the treatment of the dysfunction of the cardiovascular system.\" (Khan A, et al. Intl J Nanomedicine. 2017). Vitamin E: Vitamin E is particularly effective in protecting and repairing cell membranes due to its strong anti-oxidant properties. The benefits of vitamin E\u2014and tocotrienols in particular-in the treatment of heart disease, vascular disease, brain disorders, and fatty liver disease are well-documented. Vitamin E is also an efficient scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically targeting lipid oxidation. It can prevent oxidized fats from damaging DNA. Vitamin E also helps to extend the antioxidant neutralizing capacity of vitamin C, making these nutrients a powerful one-two punch . Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP): Citrus pectin is a naturally-occurring soluble fiber in the cell walls of citrus fruit peels. It is rich in beneficial -galactoside. However, pectin's long-chain polysaccharides are too large to be digested and absorbed into the bloodstream. So, the benefits of ordinary citrus pectin are limited to the GI tract. It is possible to shorten the pectin fibers enzymatically, and through controlled changes in pH and heat. This enhances absorption, hence the term \"modified citrus pectin.\" Another step called de-esterification decreases the cross-linkages and gelling effects seen with unmodified pectin. It also renders the fiber ends more available to bind and inhibit Galectin-3, an adhesive cell surface protein that is a strong predictive marker for CVD and other inflammatory conditions. The Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease (PREVEND) study showed that elevated serum Gal-3 correlated with a three-fold increase of all-cause mortality in a cohort of nearly 8,000 general population subjects followed for a median of 10 years (DeBoer RA, et al. J Intern Med. 2012). Data from nearly 3,000 patients in the Framingham Heart Study showed that elevated circulating Gal-3 correlates strongly with abdominal adiposity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and other indicators of CVD (Nayor M, J Am Heart Assoc. 2016). MCP has a specific and very high binding affinity for human Gal-3. Researchers at the Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, showed that MCP ameliorated cardiac dysfunction, decreased myocardial injury and reduced collagen deposition in a rodent model of myocardial fibrosis. The MCP downregulated a host of pathogenic biomarkers related to inflammation and fibrosis. The data, though preclinical, do support the notion that Gal-3 is a therapeutic target in post-infarction myocardial fibrosis, and that MCP may help to reduce the damage (Xu GR, et al. Biomed & Pharmacotherapy. 2020). CoEnzyme Q10: This valuable nutraceutical has a proven track record for the prevention and the treatment of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, MI, heart failure, viral myocarditis, cardiomyopathies, dyslipidemia, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and other cardiometabolic conditions. CoQ10 can significantly improve cardiomyopathy related to genetic or acquired dysfunctions in the left ventricle or mitral valve. A daily dose of 200 mg ameliorated fatigue and dyspnea, reduced posterior wall thickness, and improved mitral valve function. In viral myocarditis, it is able to quell inflammation. It also exhibited strong anti-inflammatory properties during various heart surgery procedures, and during recovery, as measured by C-reactive protein levels. CoQ10 reduces the negative side effects\u2014especially myopathy\u2014of statin drugs. It helps to both prevent and treat heart failure by improving the heart's contractile force and increasing cellular oxygen levels. It also improves myocardial cell survival during ischemic events, and limits post-infarction myocardial remodeling (Zozina V, et al. Current Cardiol Rev. 2018). Magnesium: Severe magnesium deficiency can lead to heart attacks. Magnesium deficiency also sensitizes the myocardium to the toxic effects of various drugs, as well as to hypoxia. Long term magnesium deficiency may also lead to chronic electrical instability of the myocardium, by affecting the sodium and calcium flow into the cells. Extracellular magnesium ions exert a profound beneficial influence on the flexibility and structure of the arteries, arterioles, and veins. Most importantly, it is the transport agent that delivers glucose and oxygen to cell membranes and to the mitochondria for energy production. Several studies have shown that anywhere from 40% to 50% of all patients hospitalized for CVD-related events are magnesium deficient (DiNicvolantonio JJ, et al. OpenHeart. 2018). Supplementation has significant potential cardioprotective benefits. But one of the challenges is that while supplemental magnesium may cross cell membranes and enter into target cells, it does not always reach the mitochondria. The addition of berberine along with magnesium can help. Berberine: Berberine is a natural compound found in plants such as European barberry enhances cellular energy production via interactions with the Glut-4 molecule to transport glucose and oxygen from the inside of the cellular membrane to the mitochondria. By increasing the efficiency of glucose delivery, it lowers the levels of circulating glucose that can cause oxidative damage to the cardiovascular system Berberine possesses a variety of pharmacological and biological properties that can potentially enhance cardiovascular performance: it reduces myocardial apoptosis and necrosis; it is a agent that can mitigate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury; and also lowers serum cholesterol and LDL (Yu L, et al. Oxidative Med Cell Longevity. 2016) Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs): The ultimate goal of cardiac repair is to regenerate functionally viable myocardium, to prevent cardiac death. SPMs have unique properties that can play a big role in the repair process. SPMs are a subtype of Omega-3 fatty and maresins. Physiologically, SPMs signal the immune system to stop generating pro-inflammatory signals, and instead to accelerate the return to homeostasis. They play a unique role in helping the body to shut down the immune response, to minimize additional inflammation, to clear away damaged tissue, and to promote tissue remodeling. The degree of post-MI inflammatory damage is a major determinant of both the subsequent healing process and the long-term prognosis. Cardiomyocyte death leads to wall thinning, ventricular dilatation, fibrosis, and ultimately to ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. In the wake of an MI, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes contribute to the clearance of dead cells, while activating reparative pathways. SPMs act on specific receptors to regulate the activity of these various leukocytes. SPMs also blunt the release of inflammatory mediators, and endothelial cell Soehnlei Front Pharmacol. 2018). Astaxanthin: Astaxanthin is a red carotenoid pigment naturally produced by a type of microalgae called Haematococcus pluvialis and by some forms of yeast. It is well known for its ability to scavenge free radicals. Astaxanthin is itself able to capture free radicals, and it also stimulates production of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and it IL-1, also apoptosis, and modulates autophagy. In the context of CVD, there are several animal studies showing cardiac muscle preservation when astaxanthin is given either orally or intravenously prior to the induction of ischemia. The evidence is promising, though not yet confirmed in human studies (Fassett RG, Coombes JS. Molecules. 2012). Several recent review articles propose a role for astaxanthin in mitigating the cardiovascular and respiratory damage caused by the COVID-19 cytokine storm. Given its myriad anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, this is a reasonable hypothesis though again, there are not yet any clinical trials to prove efficacy. L-Taurine: Taurine is a unique sulfur-containing amino acid that influences many cellular functions including osmoregulation, antioxidation, ion movement modulation, and conjugation of bile acids. It is found in high concentrations in seaweed, shellfish, and fish, and to a lesser degree in beef, lamb, pork, and poultry. Taurine is much more than simply a building block for proteins. It is anti-inflammatory, and there's some evidence that it can benefit the cardiovascular system, possibly by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system. Following ischemia induced by coronary artery occlusion, taurine resulted in significantly smaller myocardial infarct size. It also elevated superoxide dismutase levels, and decreased interleukin and TNF-. In patients with heart failure, taurine improved tolerance and recovery during increased exercise. In a study of obese women, supplementation with 3 grams of taurine per day for eight weeks, resulted in meaningful weight loss and also significant drops in systemic inflammation (Rosa TC, et al. Eur J Nutr. 2014) In another study, continued supplementation with taurine corrected cardiomyopathy by restoring mitochondrial function and improving cardiac energy metabolism (Qaradakhi T, et al. Nutrients 2020). Arterosil: This innovative product is a supplemental form of rhamnan sulfate, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from two types of sea algae (Monostroma and Monostroma Nitidum). Rhamnan also anti-inflammatory agent (Okamoto T. J Natural Med. 2019). Arterosil is particularly effective in repairing damage to the endothelial glycocalyx, the gel-like glycoprotein layer that coats the inner surfaces of blood vessels. The glycocalyx is, essentially, the first line of endothelial defense, preventing the penetration of harmful substances like oxidized LDL, cholesterol, fats, inflammatory compounds and clotting factors. Glycocalyx damage is one of the first steps in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and it correlates strongly with many biochemical markers of CVD. Arterosil has myriad cardiovascular benefits. A Baylor University study showed that within hours of ingestion, arterial elasticity increased by an average of 89.6%. MRI studies of men and women with high-risk carotid artery plaques, showed average plaque regressions of 46.8% in men and 64% in women who took Arterosil for 3 months. There was also a 56% average reduction of the lipid core size in the carotid plaques, indicating a shift away from unstable plaques prone to rupture. In addition to the above list, the following nutraceuticals also deserve honorable mention in the context of preventing Lumbrokinase, and Hawthorn berry. END Charles K.
