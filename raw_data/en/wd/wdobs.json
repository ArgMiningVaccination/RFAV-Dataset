Researchers analyzed the medical records from more than 900 babies from six hospitals and clinics in the western US between 2003 and 2013. They compared 193 infants who had come down with \"non-vaccine-targeted infections,\" like upper and lower respiratory infections and gastrointestinal infections that weren't covered by vaccines, with 741 babies who didn't get sick. The study's authors found that there was no link between giving kids vaccines at 23 months or younger and them coming down with other diseases down the road between the ages of 2 and 4 years old.
