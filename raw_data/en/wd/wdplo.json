The Department of Surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) is committed to fostering innovation and discovery by providing a research environment that nurtures intellectual diversity, embraces individual freedom, encourages flexibility, and promotes spontaneity and originality. By embracing these values, we are able to further our mission to develop more effective approaches to promoting health, preventing illness, and treating or curing disease. The 2020 issue of our Surgery Research Report highlights research that spans from bench to bedside. Our robust research platform has more than $21 million in funding from the NIH and other federal sources, major philanthropic organizations, and private industry. We conduct laboratory-based investigations that define the molecular basis of disease; develop novel surgical approaches, tools, and devices; and evaluate the effectiveness of clinical interventions on large populations of patients. We also carry out studies that shed light on disparities in the delivery of surgical care or access to treatment for our most vulnerable citizens. This research has international impact. Our faculty and residents have published hundreds of papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Many of our faculty also serve as editors and reviewers for high-impact journals such as JAMA, The New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, Science , and Nature , among others. In addition, they participate in leading medical and scientific organizations, many in leadership roles. We are also committed to training and mentoring the next generation of surgeon- investigators\u2014master-surgeons who will change the practice of medicine. We offer exceptional clinical training in surgery and novel educational opportunities that promote innovation in identifying and solving our most pressing clinical problems. The individuals whose research is highlighted in this report represent the very best of our department and medical center. They are dedicated to fulfilling our mission, serving our communities, improving health through innovation and discovery, and preparing future leaders in American medicine. Elliot L. Chaikof, MD, PhD Johnson and Johnson Professor of Surgery Chair, Department of Surgery Surgeon-in-Chief 5 2020 Surgery Research Report Overview of Surgical Research October 1, 2019 - September 30, 2020 (FY20) Introduction In addition to delivering outstanding patient care and preparing future leaders in surgery, translational and clinical research constitutes one of the cornerstones of the Department of Surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). Our research programs are focused on six thematic areas: Cancer biology Glycobiology Health services and surgical outcomes research Innate and adaptive immunity Nutrition and metabolism Regenerative medicine Important cross-cutting platforms in the Department of Surgery include the Center for Drug Discovery, the Harvard Surgical Program in Innovation (SPIN), Surgical Informatics, and the FIRST (Facilitating Innovative Research and Surgical Trials) Program, which supports clinical research and surgical trials. All divisions and nearly all faculty members participate in translational or clinical research programs. In FY20, 34 faculty members had funded research programs with dedicated research space, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and surgical residents. Many of these programs also include undergraduate and medical students pursuing research electives and fellowships. Additionally, numerous research nurses, clinical coordinators, and biostatisticians support these research efforts. Our research initiatives include clinical trials focused on the development and assessment of new drugs and surgical technologies, health services research focused on the development of effective clinical-decision tools, addressing challenges in health inequities and global health, and novel applications of machine learning and recent innovations in the field of data science. Our faculty members are principal investigators of more than 411 open clinical research protocols. All of the research projects share in common the drive to advance scientific discovery and foster the translation of research into clinical practice to improve the health and well-being of patients. In the process, the Department of Surgery has expanded its clinical research mentorship program for faculty, research fellows, and surgical residents. Our goal\u2014to prepare future leaders in American surgery who excel as master clinicians, \"own\" an important question, and embrace lifelong scholarship\u2014remains a core mission of the Department of Surgery. Leadership In FY20, research programs in the Department of Surgery were led by Richard D. Cummings, PhD, Vice Chair of Basic and Translational Research; James R. Rodrigue, PhD, Vice Chair of Clinical Research; and Benjamin C. James, MD, MS, Director of Resident Research. Richard D. Cummings, PhD, Vice Chair, Basic and Translational Research Dr. Cummings is the S. Daniel Abraham Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School in the field of Nutrition Medicine, Director of the NIH-funded National Center for Functional Glycomics, and Director of the Harvard Medical School Center for Glycoscience, all based in the Department of Surgery. In his roles as the Vice-Chair of Basic and Translational Research, Chair of the Research Council, and Associate Director for Drug Discovery and Translational Research, Dr. Cummings works with faculty to initiate research projects, identify laboratory space and collaborative research resources to assist faculty in their research, and mentor faculty and their fellows in research and advancement at Harvard Medical School. As Chair of the Surgery Research Council, Dr. Cummings helps lead faculty in promoting research initiatives and identifying ways in which the department and BIDMC can facilitate basic and translational science. Dr. Cummings works closely with Surgery Chair Elliot Chaikof, MD, PhD, in regularly meeting with faculty, discussing their career and research directions, and helping identify ways to promote faculty development. Dr. Cummings also leads the Feihe Nutrition Laboratory at BIDMC and is Director of the Cancer Glycomics Program within the Cancer Research Institute at BIDMC. 6 bidmc.org/surgery James R.

He also serves as Director of the Clinical Scholarship Program, a structured faculty-mentored clinical research experience for all first-year general surgery residents. In addition, he also serves as Chair of the Academic Promotions Committee in the Department of Surgery. Benjamin C. James, MD, MS, Director, Resident Research Dr. James is an Assistant Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, Section Chief of Endocrine Surgery in the Division of Surgical Oncology at BIDMC, and Associate Surgery Clerkship Director in the Department of Surgery. In his role as Director of Resident Research, Dr. James oversees resident pre-research advising, resident research mentorship and career development, and the resident and fellow research community. Research Infrastructure In FY20, research in the Department of Surgery occupied 24,957 square feet of space, including wet labs, special purpose rooms (cold rooms, tissue culture rooms, microscope rooms, shared equipment rooms), clinical research space, and office space. Research labs and offices are located throughout the BIDMC campus, with wet labs on the eighth floor of the Dana/Research West building on the East Campus, the Center for Life Sciences, Research North, and Stoneman building. Space for clinical research is located in the Deaconess and Sherman buildings. The overall dollar density for research space in FY20 was not calculated due to the COVID-19-related research shutdown in 2020. Research Funding Investigators in the Department of Surgery hold numerous federal awards from the National Institutes of Health including 13 R01 grants, 5 R01 are also four other large federal research project grants: from the Department of Defense (U.S. Army), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and DHHS Health Resources and Service Administration. Surgery investigators also hold numerous grants from non-profit agencies and industry. Total research funding in FY20 was more than $21 million (Figure 1) , which is approximately the same level of funding awarded in FY19. Grant awards showed a broad distribution among divisions within the Department of Surgery (Table 1) . FIGURE 1: Total (federal and non-federal) research dollars awarded per year during fiscal years (FY) 2016-2020. TABLE 1.

LoGerfo, MD) and an NIH T35-funded program directed at providing summer research opportunities for medical students (PI: Frank W. LoGerfo, MD). Investigators in Surgery also participated in the GI Surgery Research Training Grant, which is a joint NIH-funded T32 training grant among the three Harvard Medical School teaching hospitals (PI: Richard Hodin, MD, Massachusetts General Hospital). In addition to T32/T35 training grants, the Department of Surgery offers up to five research training grants for residents via the Sandra and Richard Cummings Resident Research Fellowship in Surgery. This fellowship provides a minimum of $25,000 of annual funding to residents in support of an approved research project. In FY20, recipients of these training awards were Jordan Broekhuis, MD, Gabrielle Dombek, MD, Lumeng Jenny Yu, MD, and Anirudh Penumaka, MD, MSc. The Department of Surgery was also awarded two Mentored Clinical Scientist awards (NIH-K12) to assist clinical fellows with their transition to becoming independent research investigators. These highly competitive grants were awarded to Jiaxuan Chen, PhD (PI: Elliot Chaikof, MD, PhD) and Kathryn Stackhouse, MD (PI: Richard D. Cummings, PhD). Surgical Residents, Postdoctoral Fellows, and Research Clinical Scholarship Program Our Clinical Scholarship Program, directed by James R. Rodrigue, PhD, pairs all first-year categorical general surgery residents with a faculty research mentor who guides the residents throughout the year as they acquire the skills to develop and implement a clinical research project. Residents are given one month of protected time during the second half of the first year in which to complete their project. In 2020, Harvard Medical School recognized the Clinical Scholarship Program with its annual Program Award for a Culture of Excellence in Mentoring. The objectives of the Clinical Scholarship Program are to provide residents with a robust foundation for scholarship early in their training, promote additional clinical mentorship opportunities, and enhance the opportunity to engage in efforts that will ultimately change the way we care for surgical patients. By providing this experience early in the training program, our goal is to facilitate residents' interests in scholarship, research, and an academic career. Within the structure of the Clinical Scholarship Program, residents meet regularly with research mentor(s), participate in research laboratory meetings, receive informal and formal feedback from faculty on project proposals, and are provided with readings. They also attend presentations on core topics such as clinical study design, biostatistics, communicating about research, ethics and regulatory issues, and grant writing. Residents are expected to prepare, submit, and present their research at the Department of Surgery's annual George H. A. Clowes, MD Surgery Research Symposium and the annual Harvard Medical School Surgery Research Day. In addition, residents are expected to submit abstracts for presentations at conferences, and manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Residents' Research Rotation Nearly all of our residents pursue a two- or three-year research fellowship in translational or clinical research as part of their surgical training, typically after their second or third clinical years. The residents perform research in basic science laboratories or conduct clinical outcomes research. In the last two years, residents on their research electives have produced more than 200 publications and presented their work at more than 100 national meetings. It is also possible for residents to seek advanced degrees in public health, business administration, education, or public policy. We recognize the importance of developing the next generation of surgeon-scientists and are supportive of residents who wish to pursue an advanced professional degree during residency training. An important aspect of a resident's research training is obtaining funding. To assist residents in this effort, the Office for Surgical Research provides a booklet entitled \"Funding Sources for Surgical Residents,\" which describes various funding sources, deadlines, available financial support, and application forms.

A robust clinical research infrastructure is necessary to support the myriad tasks associated with clinical research efforts within a complex regulatory environment, including study design and implementation, data collection, and biostatistics and data analysis. The FIRST (Facilitating Innovative Research and Surgical Trials) Program was established to provide a robust clinical research platform upon which clinical research can be cultivated, nourished, and expanded. Moreover, this program provides the framework necessary for supporting and mentoring the next generation of surgeon-investigators focused on patient-centered research. Led by James R. Rodrigue, PhD, Vice Chair for Clinical Research, and Aaron Fleishman, MPH, Associate Director and Associate in Surgery at Harvard Medical School, the FIRST Program is a comprehensive initiative to: Advance scientific discovery and foster the translation of research into clinical practice to improve the lives of patients Provide Department of Surgery faculty, fellows, and residents with robust and comprehensive clinical research support Employ dedicated clinical research staff with extensive experience in all facets of clinical research conducted in the department Consolidate clinical research resources and expertise in the department Provide mentorship and guidance to clinical investigators and research staff Position the Department of Surgery to compete successfully for industry, federal, and private foundation funding Serve as a formal liaison between the department's clinical research programs and regulatory agencies, including the Institutional Review Board, Office of Human Research Protections, Clinical Trials Office, and others The FIRST Program is staffed by clinical trials specialists, clinical research assistants and coordinators, a research nurse, and a biostatistician. The program offers services that are an essential part of most clinical research programs. These include, but are not limited to, research mentorship, protocol guidance and development, regulatory support, industry engagement, biostatistics support, study coordination, data collection and analysis, and grant application preparation and review.

My lab is interested in developing and delivering informatics tools to improve surgical care. The research spans three main domains: development of surgeon-oriented machine learning prediction algorithms leveraging computer vision in the operating room, and surgeon- and patient-focused interfaces to deliver these tools In these domains, we have published extensively on developing better models for post- surgery opioid use, optimizing surgical timing for patients receiving chronic medical care, operative performance analysis and temporal analytics, and better understanding trauma outcomes. I am also the clinical lead for the 4CE Consortium. Founded in March 2020, this consortium of 342 hospitals across eight countries is using novel federated methods to perform international comparisons to better understand COVID-19 and uncover nuances in care associated with differential outcomes. With collaborators at Stanford, our lab has recently developed automated video analysis tools that track surgeon hand and finger movements, tools, and surgical behaviors. These real- time tools enable creation of surgical signatures, evaluation of surgical skill, and are a first step toward understanding the contribution of individual surgeon behaviors to the outcomes of patients.39 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 Clinical lead of the 4CE International COVID Research Consortium Awarded an Blavatnik Pilot Grant for Digital Health Innovation Gave multiple national and international presentations on novel work to develop federated international COVID analytics platform Recipient of 2019-2020 Innovation Grant from BIDMC Center for Healthcare Delivery Science for the BIDMC@Home app to track opioid use and digital phenotypes of pain in surgical patients TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION I am the Associate Director of BMI 741, the \"Health Information and Technology: From Ideation to Implementation\" course at Harvard Medical School. This class applies health information technology and digital health to solve health care problems, teaching the skills to identify health care needs and pain points, design technology-based solutions (new solution, optimize existing system, or purchase vendor solution), and lead successful implementations. I also coordinate fellow research projects and the journal club within the Division of Acute Care Surgery, Trauma, and Surgical Critical Care. As a busy trauma intensivist, I am involved in the ICU journal club and regularly give lectures to residents and medical students.SELECTED RESEARCH SUPPORT Post-Surgical Opioid and Point-of-Care Surgical Decision-Making Tools.

Hauser, MD Lecturer on Surgery RESEARCH GROUP Kiyoshi Itagaki, PhD Hyo In Kim, PhD Jimbong Park, PhDRESEARCH FOCUS Our major research focus is clinical inflammation biology and the mechanisms and management of infection after injury and surgery. Our lab is especially interested in the role of \"Danger\" molecules (aka, \"damage-associated molecular patterns,\" \"DAMPs,\" \"alarmins\") in inflammation and is a world leader in investigating the role of intracellular DAMPs derived from mitochondria. Our original work on this subject ( Nature , March 4, 2010) has been widely cited as a groundbreaking conceptual advance in sepsis and inflammation research. This single paper has been cited more than 3,000 times. Important known mitochondrial DAMPs include mitochondrial DNA, formyl peptides, mitochondrial heme. Our work shows that mitochondrial formyl peptides are potent DAMPs that circulate in plasma after injury. They activate innate immune cells while causing suppression of cell-surface chemoreceptors for leuko-attractants like chemokines and leukotrienes. Thus innate immune chemoattractant-activators and immune modulators. Mitochondrial (mt)DNA is also a potent agonist that targets toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9). We showed mtDNA is also a activator of neutrophil (PMN) extracellular traps (\"NETs\") and TLR-9 activation also results in suppression of chemotaxis. Thus it plays a critical role in sepsis after injury. Mitochondrial formyl peptides (mtFPs) are potent chemoattractants that activate immune responses to injury like phagocytic wound debridement. Thus they also help initiate healing. Conversely, mtFPs compete for the immune system's \"attention\" after major injury. We showed that innate responses to FPs released by injury render the host susceptible to pneumonia by suppressing immune surveillance of the lung. We also showed that only 5/13 native mitochondrial FPs are active at the FP receptors. We have developed antagonists for human and mouse FP receptors (FPRs) and used these tools for therapeutic intervention. We used knockout mice to show post-traumatic pneumonia results from FPR-1 engagement and reversed post-traumatic pneumonia using designer FPR-1 inhibitors ( Critical Care Med , 2020). Our current work centers on balancing the need for inflammation after injury and the susceptibility to infection that inflammation incurs. Molecular aspects of these problems we study (that participants can become expert in) include cell signaling, chemokine biology, cellular calcium signaling, chemotaxis, regulation of permeability, neutrophil NET formation, and microparticle signaling. Our collaborations include studies as diverse as sepsis in injured warfighters and plasma mediator phenotypes in COVID-19. Current collaborations within BIDMC include work with my longtime colleague Kiyoshi Itagaki, PhD, and the laboratories of Leo Otterbein, PhD, Simon Robson, MD, PhD, and Michael Yaffe, MD, PhD. For the last four years we have been funded by the Department of Defense to perform a \"focused program award\" addressing the role of DAMPs in creating susceptibility to infection in wounded warfighters. The labs in this multi-PI grant have grouped together as the Harvard-Longwood Consortium for Translational Biology, or \"HALO\" group. This program uses computational biology to address the role of DAMPs in changes in cellular and humoral immune phenotypes (\"endotypes\") over time and determine how these are permissive of health care- acquired pneumonia. Our currently evolving programs center on: 1) using machine learning and multiplexed plasma mediator phenotyping to distinguish inflammatory syndromes like sepsis, SIRS, and viral illnesses, thus allowing outcomes prediction and directed interventions, and 2) the creation of immunologically active wound dressings that will suppress infection for use in military applications.41 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 Medical Director of Trauma Services, BIDMC Led the Harvard Longwood (HALO) consortium for translational inflammation biology Immediate Past President, Western Trauma Association Visiting Professorships and Invited Presentations Mechanisms and Management of Inflammation in Trauma and Shock.

Hauser, MD Hyo In Kim, PhD Barbora Konen\u00e1, PhD Jinbong Park, PhD Wei Huang, PhDRESEARCH FOCUS We are interested in the prevention and treatment of nosocomial pneumonia after serious injury. We have hypothesized/established a new paradigm that involves release of our own mitochondria from damaged tissues/cells after injury, causing dysfunction of neutrophils upon interaction of formyl peptides contained in mitochondria via formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1). Neutrophils will migrate to the injury sites following mitochondrial formyl peptides to protect the body from bacterial infections or to clean up debris. However, this process causes internalization of chemokine receptors on neutrophils so that neutrophils cannot respond to the help signals from bacteria-infected lungs. This will lead to the development of nosocomial pneumonia, ARDS, and sepsis. We developed two methods that may prevent seriously injured people from developing nosocomial pneumonia. These are: 1) Reduce the number of neutrophils that encounter mitochondrial formyl peptides by FPR1 antagonist so that many neutrophils will remain functional and respond to bacterial infection in the lungs; 2) If only a reduced number of neutrophils can reach bacteria-infected lungs, apply exogenous neutrophils directly to the bacteria-infected lungs. The application of FPR1 antagonist and exogenous neutrophils showed promising effects using mouse injury/lung bacterial infection models. Before we move on to primates and humans, we want to try these methods with pigs, which are the best animal models in which to study infectious diseases because they have immune responses that are very similar to humans. mtDAMPs released after injury induce nosocomial pneumonia43 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 I submitted three R21 grant applications in June 2020.

The title was Mitochondrial DAMPs and Nosocomial Pneumonia. Beginning in March 2020 our productivity was greatly impacted due to COVID-19 and the need to work from home or during limited lab hours. Despite this, I was able to write grants and papers and tried to maintain our lab work by communicating remotely with my fellows. Some fellows had to depart to their home countries to avoid lockdowns, further affecting our productivity. TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION Despite the impact of COVID-19, I was able to engage in frequent online conversations about our experiments with members of the lab.

Junger, PhD Professor of Surgery RESEARCH GROUP Dilan Aytan Carola Ledderose, PhD Yong Shen Christian Slubowski, MD, PhDRESEARCH FOCUS Immune cells release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that induces autocrine signaling mechanisms needed for cell function. In healthy individuals, these autocrine signaling mechanisms coordinate chemotaxis, pathogen recognition, immune cell interactions, antigen processing, and immune cell proliferation. ATP release and the subsequent autocrine feedback mechanisms triggered by ATP are therefore prerequisites for a successful host immune response. We have elucidated a complex system of ATP and adenosine receptors\u2014collectively termed purinergic receptors\u2014that regulate these immune cellular responses. We found that purinergic receptors fine-tune localized calcium influx and downstream signaling pathways that trigger cell activation, organize cytoskeletal rearrangements, and coordinate processes needed for functional cell responses. We further found that these mechanisms are impaired under pathological conditions. Traumatic injuries, cardiopulmonary arrest, and bacterial and viral infections all cause large amounts of ATP to be released from inflamed tissues and damaged cells. The resulting excess amount of extracellular ATP in critically ill patients interferes with the autocrine purinergic signaling mechanisms needed for immune cell functions. As a result, immune dysfunction in these patients causes sepsis, host organ damage, and multiple organ failure syndrome, which are major causes of death in critically ill patients. The focus of our laboratory has been to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to these complications. Our most recent work has shown that metabolic pathways regulate cellular ATP release. We found that mitochondria produce the ATP that cells release in order to fuel their autocrine purinergic signaling mechanisms. We could show that mitochondrial ATP production, intracellular translocation of mitochondria, localized ATP release, and selective stimulation of purinergic receptors on the cell surface represent complex signaling networks that regulate neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and monocytes. Our current focus is on the question of how mitochondrial defects and dysregulated ATP signaling impact immune responses in vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to identify therapeutic strategies to restore purinergic signaling and effective immune defenses in critically ill patients, particularly in pediatric and older patients who are disproportionally impacted by bacterial and viral infections.

Otterbein, PhD Professor of Surgery RESEARCH FOCUS Inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) is in numerous FDA phase trials, based in large part from the research from my laboratory over the past two decades. We continue to maintain a focus on the innate immune response and defense mechanisms in models of trauma, infection, ischemia reperfusion injury, and regenerative responses to tissue damage. The foundation of our work lies in the study of protective genes and in particular those that degrade heme and include heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and biliverdin reductase (BVR). Both genes are intimately involved in the stress response and function in large part by generating CO and bilirubin as endogenous bioactive products. We expanded our research program to include collaborative projects on cancer, neurology, GI disease, and exercise physiology. Each complements and advances our understanding of the acute stress response, tissue injury and repair, and the roles of HO-1/CO as they relate to immunologic and pathophysiologic responses. Ultimately, we are interested in translational research to provide solutions to alleviate human suffering. Role of Heme in Trauma and Infection As Co-Director of a Department of Defense focused research award ($10M), I and my team continue our efforts to identify and characterize deliverables to benefit injured warfighters. We are defining how heme influences recovery from trauma and subsequent susceptibility to bacterial infection. This research involves studies with Drs. Carl Hauser, Daniel Talmor, Simon Robson, and Michael Yaffe of BIDMC and Jim Lederer of BWH. Our data in sepsis models shows that HO-1 and CO are critical determinants in fighting infection and tissue repair after trauma. We are also funded with an NIH SBIR ($250K) to evaluate a novel orally delivered CO solution that can be rapidly consumed for effective CO delivery. As part of a collaborative project funded by a multi-PI R01 with Boston University ($350K), we are studying how noncoding RNA (lncRNA) influences macrophage signaling. Neuroprotection against Concussion with HO-1 Funded by the National Football League ($2.5M), we are studying the effects of CO to reduce the sequelae of mild repetitive concussion in mice as a model of mild repetitive traumatic brain injury (mrTBI). We maintain an active collaboration with Patrick Fuller, PhD (BIDMC, Neurology) in the study of brain injury, where we find that glia-expressed HO-1 are critical in resolution of injury and impact neurotransmission. Inhaled CO enhances recovery, reduces inflammation and cell death, and improves cognitive function. We are studying the effects of mrTBI on arousal and behavior as it relates to athletes who experience multiple concussions. This work is funded with a multi-institutional program grant ($18M) to evaluate the effects of CO to alleviate brain injury. Over the next four years we will study the mechanisms of action and the role of HO-1/CO to limit injury and promote recovery. Exciting preliminary data in mice demonstrate the remarkable role of HO-1 in brain homeostasis. Oral Carbon Monoxide Liquid and Anthracyclin Cardiotoxicity We are funded with an NIH SBIR grant ($300K) to study an innovative oral CO solution in a mouse model of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in collaboration with Hillhurst Biopharmaceuticals. These studies complement and expand on those we have reported on with inhaled CO, which protects against acute and chronic cardiac injury. The oral formulation is simple and is being applied to multiple model systems, including TBI and trauma. Proof of principle has been demonstrated and human testing begins in 2021. Oral Carbon Monoxide Liquid and Experimental Colitis We are funded with an NIH SBIR grant ($300K) to study the innovative oral CO solution in models of colitis in mice, in collaboration with Hillhurst Biopharmaceuticals. These studies complement and expand on those we have reported on with inhaled CO, which protects against inflammation of the GI system. HO-1 in Cancer In collaboration with and funded ($350K) by a company in Cambridge we are studying the role of macrophages in tumor growth, testing the hypothesis that the phenotype of the macrophage and neutrophil regulates its ability to direct T cell function. Using our regulated HO-1 null mice and HO-1/HO-2 regulated knockouts, we find that blockade of HO-1 significantly reduces tumor growth and are now exploring mechanisms of action using CyTOF and scRNAseq. CO Prodrugs in Experimental Colitis CO has been well described as a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, but the challenge is to define novel methods to deliver CO. Through a multi-PI project with Georgia State University, we were funded with an R01 to use medicinal chemistry technology to develop new classes of molecules to influence the host tissue response and the microbiome toward one promoting GI health.

Additionally, preliminary data show that injury leads to changes in cellular glycans, specifically in the neutrophil responding to bacteria. This finding is part of a new collaborative project with Drs. Richard Cummings and Carl Hauser of BIDMC to integrate glycobiological changes that occur in response to injury, comparing human and murine samples. HO-1 and Exercise Metabolism Rodrigo Souza, PhD, was awarded an American Heart Association Career Development Award ($225K) to study how exercise influences HO-1 expression and contributes to skeletal muscle function and cardioprotection. Preliminary findings suggest that exercise metabolism is influenced by heme catabolism and the generation of CO. ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 We continue to be one of the leaders in the area of heme metabolism and the stress response, providing mechanistic insight into the role of HO-1 and its bioactive products carbon monoxide and the bile pigments.

We believe that in response to various types of damage, cells activate a common set of signaling pathways that control damage repair, recruit the innate immune system, and dictate the extent of tissue survival, inflammation and healing, or result in various types of cell death. We study the molecular components of these injury-induced signaling pathways and the manner in which these pathways communicate with each other to control the biological outcome after damage, using a combination of biochemistry, molecular cell biology, and systems-based computational approaches. We are particularly interested in cross-talk between: 1) stress, inflammation, blood clotting and immune function after trauma, 2) stress, inflammation, innate immune function, and cancer, and 3) targeting injury, DNA damage, and cell cycle control pathways for cancer treatment. Our lab has a long-standing interest in inventing new technologies to address these questions. These include novel proteomic methods; high-throughput screens; and novel computational/bioinformatics methods. We use these together with more traditional techniques from cell biology, physical biochemistry, structural biology, and mouse genetic models. Signaling Pathways and Cell Injury Networks That Control the DNA Damage Response, Cell Cycle Progression, and Cancer When cells encounter stress or injury such as DNA damage, they activate complex signaling networks that regulate their ability to recover, repair the damage, and return to a homeostatic equilibrium. These networks must integrate a wide variety of signals from inside and outside the cell, transduced through protein kinase and lipid signaling pathways, to ultimately control cell cycle arrest or progression, coordinately regulate specific patterns of gene expression, and/or initiate senescence or cell death. Mutations in, or dysfunction of, protein kinase signaling pathways that normally respond to cell stress and DNA damage, for example, play critical roles in tumor development and progression. Targeting these pathways increases the ability of DNA-damaging chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy to cure cancer. Our research is directed along two fronts: 1) characterizing the molecular details of the DNA damage response with a focus on protein kinases, phospho-binding domains, RNA-binding proteins, and epigenetic modulation of chromatin at the site of damage, and 2) examining whether cross-talk between stress and injury signaling pathways and the DNA damage response can be manipulated to enhance the response of tumors to DNA damaging agents alone, or in combination with, immunotherapy. We showed, for example, that p53-defective tumor cells become dependent on signaling through the stress-activated p38-MK2 pathway to resist killing by chemotherapy. We have now created a variety of standard and novel conditional MK2 knock-out mice, as well as nanoparticles delivering MK2-targeted RNAi and CRISPR, to target this pathway in vivo in ovarian, lung, and colon cancer models. We are continuing to explore the how the MK2 pathway cross-talks with several DNA repair pathways, as well as performing CRISPR-based screens to look for new modifiers of the DNA damage response that can be therapeutically targeted. This work has led to a new focus on the role of RNA damage and RNA-binding proteins as critical integrators of stress/injury and DNA damage response pathways in the cell. We recently extended this work on DNA damage-induced cell injury to identify novel signaling mechanisms that enhance the response of cancers to immunotherapy, particularly in ovarian cancer. Finally, we discovered that inhibitors of 49 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.Polo-like kinases can synergize with both specific hormonal therapies or anti-microtubule drugs to cause severe mitotic injury and damage in cancer cells, but not in normal cells. This has led to an ongoing clinical trial in prostate cancer at BIDMC, in collaboration with Drs. Steve Balk and David Einstein (Hematology-Oncology, BIDMC) studying Abiraterone in combination with Plk1 inhibition in patients with progressive castrate- resistant prostate cancer. Signaling Pathways and Networks That Control Inflammation, Blood Clotting, and Immune Function in Trauma, Cancer, and COVID-19 Stress and injury-induced activation of neutrophils and macrophages after massive tissue trauma results in an early systemic inflammatory response, inappropriate activation of the blood clotting cascade, and multiple organ failure, and this is partly recapitulated in COVID-19. The molecular basis for these effects is poorly understood but involves dysregulation of key signaling pathways in neutrophils and macrophages that control tissue damage, clot lysis, and inflammation. We have found that signaling through the p38-MK2 pathway is crucial for cytokine control and innate immune function, in part by modulating the phenotypic switch between pro-inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils and immunosuppressive macrophages and neutrophils. Our work has led to an ongoing clinical trial for ovarian cancer in collaboration with Dr. Brahm Segal at Roswell Park Cancer Center, and a multicenter clinical trial using tissue plasminogen activator for critically ill patients with COVID-19 ARDS.

Using group video trainers, we demonstrated for the first time in Surgery that intense skills training improved operative performance. OR team training with simulation advanced patient safety. Simulation/Education Since 2005, we have had continuous NIH funding to support collaborative projects among the Center for Modeling, Simulation and Imaging in Medicine (CeMSIM), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), and the Carl J. Shapiro Simulation and Skills Center, BIDMC. We developed and validated virtual reality (VR) simulators for laparoscopic hernia repair, LapBand, NOTES cholecystectomy, and FLS tasks. The current aim is to develop the Virtual OR Team Experience (VORTex) and within VR operating room avatars respond to crisis (fire, hemorrhage). Bariatric Surgery My research also focuses on clinical outcomes. In collaboration with Christina Wee, MD, MPH (Department of Medicine, BIDMC), we have a large database from which we have published this year on the following topics: expectations for weight loss and willingness to accept risk, quality of life among obese patients, obesity-related stigmata and functional status, patient factors associated with undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and high-risk alcohol use after weight loss surgery. This research is funded by the NIH. In collaboration with Brown University, we are funded by the NIH to better understand how we can use technology to help our bariatric surgery patients with lifestyle changes.

Ginsburg Associate Professor of Surgery Chief, Cardiac Surgery RESEARCH FOCUS The multidisciplinary Valve Research Group primarily investigates the dynamic behavior of heart valves in both normal and pathologic states. Heart valves are complex 3-dimensional (3D) structures that undergo dynamic changes during the cardiac cycle. Investigating this behavior is of critical importance in understanding the pathophysiology of and devising management strategies for valvular disease. Together with Dr. Feroze Mahmood and a multidisciplinary Valve Research Group, normal and abnormal size, shape, and geometric parameters pertaining to the mitral, tricuspid, and aortic valves are being researched. In addition, we are studying the impact different surgical interventions (e.g., aortic valve replacement and mitral annuloplasty) have on native valve function and surrounding anatomy. To accomplish this, we analyze 3D echocardiographic data using commercially available software, including Philips Qlab and TomTec Image Arena. These software programs enable us to dynamically track and measure anatomical changes in a clinically feasible fashion. We are currently in the process of extending similar analyses to normal and pathologic tricuspid valves, leading to a more robust understanding of tricuspid valve behavior. Investigations are also underway to investigate the in vivo effects of different annuloplasty devices on dynamic valve motion and geometry. These data and analyses hold significant potential in furthering the evidence base for valve repair strategies and surgical decision- making toward achieving the best outcomes. The Valve Research Group is involved with multiple national and international universities engaged in devising new methods of interrogating valvular structures using 3D echocardiography. We are continuing our collaboration with Cardiology and Vascular and Endovascular Surgery on multiple projects, including clinical trials: Multi-Center Experience with the Rapid Deployment EDWARDS INTUITY Valve System for Aortic Valve ReplaceMent (TRANSFORM Trial, Protocol Number 2011-02): The purpose of this clinical investigation is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the investigational EDWARDS INTUITY Valve System in subjects with aortic stenosis or stenosis-insufficiency requiring replacement of the native aortic valve. Clinical Trial of the On-X Valve Using Low Dose Anticoagulation: The purpose of this study is to define the lowest level of required antithrombotic therapy for mitral or aortic valve replacement using the On-X Valve. Medtronic Core Valve U.S. Pivotal Trial-Extreme Risk Patients; Medtronic CoreValve\u00ae U.S. Pivotal Trial - High Risk Surgical Patients; Medtronic CoreValve\u00ae U.S. Continued Access Study; Medtronic CoreValve\u00ae U.S. Expanded Use Study; Medtronic CoreValve\u00ae SURTAVI Trial: The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the Medtronic CoreValve\u00ae System in the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis in high-risk and very high-risk subjects who need aortic valve replacement. Early Feasibility Study of the CardiAQ Transcatheter Mitral Valve (TMV) System with Transseptal Delivery System for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Mitral Regurgitation REPRISE III: REpositionable Percutaneous Replacement of Stenotic through Implantation of Lotus Valve System-Randomized Clinical EvaluationRESEARCH GROUP Louis Chu, MD David Liu, MD Feroze-ud-Den Mahmood, MD53 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 Several studies are in progress; those completed so far have shown promising results. The results of one study demonstrate that left-ventricular outflow tract area is signicantly underestimated by two-dimensional (2D) measurements when compared with 3D data. This underestimation of the LVOT area with 2D echocardiography potentially overestimates the degree of aortic stenosis (AS). Such errors in assessing disease severity can have important clinical consequences vis-\u00e0-vis the decision to operate vs. not operate. In another study, we describe the workflow in development and use of a customizable left-sided pulsatile heart model in which patient-specific, 3-dimensionally printed patient valves can be modeled under physiological intracardiac pressures. The model allows for TEE visualization and promotes familiarization of heart anatomy, surgical equipment, and imaging workflow for trainees. We have also successfully demonstrated the use of 3D echocardiography in analyzing mitral valve geometry in patients with functional mitral valve regurgitation (FMR). Previously, the understanding of annular dynamics in FMR was largely limited to information derived from animal models. The Valve Research Group has been recognized and granted the status of a hospital \"core laboratory\" for 3D printing, establishing a state-of-the-art 3D printing laboratory. We have recently begun 3D printing patient-specific mitral valves for creation of silicone replicas to be placed in our state-of-the-art pulse duplicator device, which generates realistic pulsatility and allows for TEE visualization. Additionally, multiple echocardiography simulators serve as a dedicated simulation laboratory.SELECTED PUBLICATIONS O'Gara BP, Mueller A, Gasangwa V, B.

We approach our work by studying the details of gastric barrier function in general and its disruption during Helicobacter pylori infection using genetic, advanced microscopy, and genomic approaches. Our aims have two important goals: one is to understand basic science principles and the other is translational. Although the stomach expresses a specific subset of claudin molecules, which are proteins that confer barrier properties to epithelial cells at the tight junction, one particular claudin is highly expressed in stomach, claudin-18 (CLDN18) . Claudin-18 is a cation-selective tight junction protein that is transcriptionally down-regulated in H. pylori infection in mice as well as in human patients with gastric cancer. Because claudin-18 (protein) and its gene, CLDN18 , are attenuated in disease, we made Cldn18 knockout mice to study its role in mucosal barrier function in general and in gastric cancer pathogenesis in particular. Our recent work demonstrated that claudin-18 is most highly expressed as a basolateral membrane protein and functions as a potent tumor suppressor in the stomach; knockout of Cldn18 promotes gastric cancer development (Gastroenterology, 2018). In the past year, using Ussing chambers to study paracellular flux across the mucosa in ex vivo stomach, we showed that no paracellular permeability defects occur in CLDN18 knockout mice (Figure 1). These unexpected results suggested that cancer pathogenesis in the absence of Cldn18 does not occur because increased mucosal permeability promotes inflammation, mucosa damage, and cancer development. We are now investigating signaling pathways regulated by Cldn18 that affect cancer development in our Cldn18 knockout and conditional knockout mouse models. Metabolism Projects A second project in the lab involves a close collaboration with David Cohen, MD, PhD, Chief of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York and Eric Ortlund, PhD, Professor of Biochemistry at Emory University, to study the role of thioesterase superfamily member 1 (Them1) in hepatic steatosis/NAFDL. We became involved with this project due to our expertise in microscopy. In the past year, we used near super-resolution confocal microscopy and CLEM (Figure 2), bioinformatic, genetic, and metabolic techniques, which required the combined expertise of the three labs, to demonstrate that Them1 in vivo and in vitro forms novel biomolecular condensates (we call \"puncta\") that represent the functionally active form of Them1. Upon stimulation, the Them1- containing puncta disperse via phosphorylation of specific serine residues at the amino terminus. Using LSMS, we demonstrated the position of serine phosphorylation events and showed the role each plays in regulating Them1 function. We are currently working to understand mechanisms that regulate the phase transition required to form puncta and looking at the role Them1 plays in regulating transcriptional events that occur after stimulation. In its diffuse state, Them1 transits to the nucleus, where we believe it is involved in the transcription of metabolic proteins that regulate fatty acid metabolism. FIGURE 1: Published in Cellular and Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology by Tyler Caron, DVM (a previous postdoctoral fellow in the lab) et al, Cldn18 - loss does not affect barrier function but results in changes in ion transport characteristics of the stomach.

FIGURE 2: Images of puncta in cultured brown adipose cells transduced with the Them1 mutant S15-S18-S25D (AAA) whereby all cells contain puncta (P). In A, puncta are labeled with EGFP (green), lipid droplets with perilipin1 in magenta, and the nucleus with Hoechst in blue. In B, cells were transduced with AAA-APEX2 and stained by conventional histochemical techniques so that puncta are brown (arrows or P1, P2, P3). Puncta were typically localized near lipid droplets LD. The images are from Li et al, 2020. ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 Individual Accomplishments The most important accomplishment was that both of our main research grants were renewed in FY20. Our Them1 project renewal was refunded and the HDDC Center grant was refunded. Both grant applications received an outstanding score in peer review.

A large prospective database has been developed and maintained from a robust clinical practice, providing the substrate for our outcomes investigations. In addition, we have utilized national large databases of pancreas cancer patients/outcomes. Areas of emphasis are factors associated with patient-centered decision making and care, as well as care transitions, the transition from inpatient to post-discharge care, and prediction of post-discharge needs. Based on earlier work, we developed a discharge informational tool for patients and evaluated its utility after pancreatectomy. Recent efforts have focused on investigating the means by which patients process information about their pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment options, with a goal of improving patient understanding of, and contribution to, their care. We have assessed the readability, accuracy, and suitability of available online information on pancreatic cancer, the communication between the care team and patients and families, and the use of health literacy assessments. We are now investigating the relationship between preferred language and time to definitive treatment. We are developing a process to assess health literacy and cultural expectations in patients with new pancreas cancer diagnoses in order to evaluate the impact of these factors on patient progression to care. In addition, our group has collaborated with colleagues around the world through our Americas Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (AHPBA) and International Hepato-Pancreato- Biliary Association (IHPBA) networks. Surgical Education Research (Dr. Kent) Our surgical education research effort includes the study of factors influencing resident acquisition of knowledge and skills, as well as development of novel curricula. Recently, we have been studying potential sources of bias in the residency application process. We are also involved in an NIH-funded multi-center study of the impact of a surgical resident curriculum on cultural dexterity.

I am currently focusing on the application of global phosphor profiling to discover signaling proteins/pathways involved in the progression of BE. My past research in the area of molecular biology and genomics laid the seeds for such a project as this. My interest in esophageal and gastric biology fuels my desire to study the fundamental biology of foregut disease, namely BE and gastric cancer using high-throughput technologies such as mass spectrometry as a powerful proteomic tool to interrogate protein machinery in aberrant molecular processes. Currently, I am principal investigator of an IRB approved, pilot study of BE with multi- institutional, international collaborative involvement. BE results from chronic acid reflux and inflammation to the squamous esophageal epithelium lining the esophagus and induces metaplastic changes in cellular architecture that can lead to esophageal cancer (EAC). The majority of patients undergoing endoscopy for BE tolerate the burden of unnecessary, frequent invasive endoscopy and biopsy for surveillance and concern about progression to near fatal EAC. Efforts to reduce this burden have been hindered by the lack of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underly progression as well as the lack of effective diagnostics that can decipher those patients who will progress to EAC from those who will not. Of note, fewer than 1% of patients will progress to the near fatal EAC. The challenge is how to distinguish patients who will benefit from invasive surveillance from those who will not. Our research has set out to interrogate endoscopic biopsy specimens from living patients with and without (controls) BE, and analyze these biopsy specimens using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry analysis to see if there are detectable differences at the molecular level in patients who have BE versus those who do not. Our central hypothesis is that patients with BE who progress to EAC do so via molecular changes that are triggered in the setting of chronic acid reflux. If one can identify the molecular mechanisms General Surgery FIGURE 1: Depictions of the process of (A) sample collection and categorization (BE=Barrett's Esophagus, PAN=paired adjacent normal, PNB=paired non-Barrett's, NB=non-Barrett's) from two cohorts; (B) 26 sample preparation pipeline for LC/MS analysis from biopsy to mass spectrometry analysis; and (C) biosignature discovery from data obtained in B (left); clinical data on the survivability of esophageal cancer patients with proteomic signatures of BE (middle left); pathway level comparative analysis between independent transcriptomic datasets of BE tissue with neighboring unafflicted tissue and the matched samples of our study (middle right); and phospho-proteome pathway analysis of study samples (right).63 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.that underpin these cellular changes, the potential exists for intervention with targeted therapeutics. The goal of this work is to compare and contrast biopsied normal esophageal epithelium to that of Barrett's pathology using quantitative phosphor- proteomic profiling for measuring signalling perturbations when comparing Barrett's epithelium to normal and dysplastic esophageal epithelium. Our aim is to examine the networks and interactions of clinically relevant signalling proteins disrupted during the progression of BE to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that drive its progression. Global phosphor-proteomic profiling offers a powerful means for interrogating critical cancer cell systems on a holistic, cellular scale. In our pilot study, we identified 7,018 proteins and 8,420 phosphosites in the discovery cohort, revealing hundreds of statistically significant (p <0.05, moderated t-test) differences in protein and phospho-site abundance between BE and matched normal esophageal epithelium. We further identified a proteomic signature that classified samples on disease status. To take this one step further, we used projection analysis of the discovery signature against EAC tumor profiles and have found it to be strongly predictive of survival outcomes. Lastly, subsequent comparative analysis with published BE transcriptomic profiles provided independent evidence in support of these results. We have just submitted this work for peer review.

My laboratory has focused on evaluating the effects of bioactive natural compounds on inhibition of growth and progression of certain types of cancer, blood glucose management, alleviation of chronic kidney disease, promotion of gut health, prevention of osteoporosis, improvement of cognition, inhibition of UV-induced skin damage, and investigating the mechanisms of action of bioactive components. In the past year, my laboratory has focused on the following projects. Synergistic Combinations of Tanshinones against Cancer Progression Our studies have shown that tanshinones, which include cryptotanshinone (CT), anti-growth and anti-cancer stem cell (CSC) self-renewal activities against several types of cancer cell lines. We also found that the CT and T1 combination had synergistic effect against prostate cancer in part via downregulation of aurora kinases and c-Myc. Our animal studies further verified that the T1 and CT combination inhibited prostate cancer progression in a synergistical manner. Bioactive Components Delay the Development and Progression of Chronic Kidney Injury and Improve Cognition We have studied the effects of oligo-lactic acid product (LAP) and a fermented soybean product (ImmuBalance, IMB) on chronic kidney disease and associated cognitive impairment in vivo. LAP or IMB delayed the progression of adenine-induced chronic kidney injury in mice by inhibiting inflammation and reducing kidney toxicity via modulation of inflammation biomarkers in blood and kidney samples and alteration of gut microbiota, and could significantly improve cognition. We are investigating the underlying mechanisms of action of these bioactive components on improving cognition. Effects of Bioactive Components on Control of Hyperglycemia and Associated Cognitive Decline In this project, we evaluated the effects of novel dietary ingredients, nostoc and its fiber fraction, on metabolic disorders and associated cognitive decline by applying both the db/db and high-fat diet-induced obesity (DIO)/prediabetic animal models. We found that nostoc components significantly reduced fasting blood glucose levels in both animal models and delayed diabetes-associated cognitive impairment in part via increasing pancreatic beta-cell proliferation. Effects of Epimedium Components on Osteoporosis Prevention In this project, we evaluated the effects of an epimedium flavonoids extract (EFE) and the major component, icariin, on bone metabolism. In vitro studies indicated that EFE and icariin could stimulate osteoblast differentiation, but inhibit osteoclast differentiation. The animal study showed that EFE and icariin reduced osteoporosis. We are in the process of studying underlying mechanisms of action. Effects of Acai Components on Prevention of UV-Induced Skin Damage In this project, we evaluated the effect of acai components on UV-induced skin damage. In vitro studies showed that acai bioactive components inhibited the UV-induced keratinocyte apoptosis and ROS production associated with modulation of oxidative stress and skin damage-related biomarkers. We are conducting an animal study to confirm the efficacy of acai bioactive components in protecting the UV-induced skin damage and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action.General Surgery65 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 Grant Review Activities Review panel, General Research Fund, Research Grant Council, Hong Kong, 2020 Review panel, Faculty Development Scheme, Research Grant Council, Hong Kong, 2020 Special Emphasis Panel, Cancer Drug Development and Therapeutics, ZRG1 OTC-T (10), NCI/NIH, 2020 Review panel, Function and Efficacy of Nutrients Review Panel of National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 2019, 2020 Editorial Roles Editorial board member: Clinical Medicine: Endocrinology and Diabetes; Digital Chinese Medicine; Hepatobiliary Surgery and Nutrition; Journal of Disease and Global Health; Journal of Personalized Medicine; Precision Medical Sciences; Single Cell Biology Associate Editor: Integrative Oncology and Rehabilitation Field Editor: Functional Foods in Health & Disease Editor-in-Chief: Nutrition and Metabolic Insights (2012-present)Invited Presentations Overview of Evidence-Based Platforms for Research and Development of Nutraceuticals.

This has led to major discoveries in molecular mechanisms of leukocyte trafficking in inflammation and homing, and the roles of glycoproteins in autoimmunity, neurobiology, and infectious diseases, as well as fundamental genetic regulation of protein glycosylation in normal biological processes and disease states. We also develop technologies to explore the molecular nature and specificity of protein-glycan interactions and their roles in biology, and how glycans are recognized by glycan-binding proteins (GBPs). My laboratory has been instrumental in developing new technologies associated with the National Center for Functional Glycomics, headquartered in our lab. In addition, my lab has been instrumental as a training site for educating researchers in the field of glycoscience. My laboratory has established the identities and specificities of many glycosyltransferases that regulate protein glycosylation and glycan-binding proteins, including novel antibodies to glycan antigens. In our translational studies, we are exploring glycoimmunology, and the roles of adaptive and innate immune responses to pathogens, as well as human diseases that are both heritable and acquired, and that involve altered glycosylation. We have developed novel techniques in the field for glycan analysis and for exploring the structure/function relationships of glycans using genetic/molecular approaches, biophysical and biochemical strategies, and microarray and glycan bead strategies, including glycan microarrays from natural tissues. We also use a novel sea lamprey system for developing unique antibodies that target glycan structures found on glycoconjugates or specific cells and tissues. These antibodies, termed VLRs, are instrumental in our work to define the human glycome. We are also developing semi-synthetic methods for making glycoconjugates and for isolating, characterizing, and derivatizing glycans, which are revolutionary and growing at a rapid pace. I currently hold 32 patents in the field of glycoscience, and have been the founder or cofounder of three biotechnology companies. My laboratory is the headquarters of the National Center for Functional Glycomics (NCFG), of which I am the Director, and the Protein-Glycan Interaction Resource of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG), of which I am the Chair, and offers glycan microarray services to hundreds of laboratories worldwide. We also have a strong effort in promoting and developing bioinformatics web-based tools and databases related to glycoscience. My laboratory and the NCFG moved to Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in the fall of 2015, where I founded and was appointed Director of the new Harvard Medical School Center for Glycoscience. My research goals are centered on identifying the structures, functions, and biosynthesis of complex glycoconjugates in a variety of normal and pathologic biological processes and in understanding and characterizing the human glycome.

Lijun Sun, PhD Associate Professor of Surgery Director, Center for Drug Discovery and Translational Research RESEARCH FOCUS The Center for Drug Discovery and Translational Research provides a platform and expertise in medicinal chemistry to promote bench-to-bedside translation. My laboratory has studied the optimal integration of molecular simulations into the generation of bioactive molecules. In collaboration with investigators at Harvard Medical School, we have applied this research methodology for the discovery of novel inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between interleukin (IL)-18 and its Leena Pradhan-Nabzdyk, (collaborator: Dr. Bruce Zetter, Boston Children's Hospital), the Dr. J. Ashot Kozak, Wright State University), as well as the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the PSGL-1 mimetics (collaborator: Dr. Elliot Chaikof, BIDMC). Overly activated mast cells are implicated in the pathology of a number of diseases, including diabetic neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcer. Mast cell activation and the release of a spectrum of proinflammatory mediators are controlled by calcium channels. We have synthesized a new class of calcium channel blockers that effectively inhibit channel function and mast cell degranulation. We have demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of diabetic wound healing and the multidisciplinary study led to a publication in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology . Our current focus is to optimize the kinetics of the channel-blocker interactions, which might provide insights for defining their mechanism of action and generating improved pharmacological tool molecules. AHR is a ligand activated transcription factor and controls the expression of IL-22, which plays a critical role in the maintenance and regeneration of barrier tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, and skin. Our computational and SAR studies of a series of novel 3-acylindoles revealed structural attributes important for AHR activation. Orally bioavailable AHR agonists were achieved via improvement of metabolic stability and permeability. We demonstrated in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease that oral administration of the potent AHR agonists significantly reduced disease severity and protected animals from tissue damages in the gut (published in Science Advances ). CLKs are a class of kinases that regulate the alternative splicing of messenger RNA and are considered attractive drug targets for cancer as well as neurodegenerative disorders. We have discovered a class of benzimidazoles as highly selectively CLK inhibitors that we have recently shown inhibit tumor growth in multiple mouse models, including prostate, lung, and colon cancer. 69 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 One of our anticancer projects entered into a licensing option agreement with an emerging biotech company, which might lead to its clinical development as a first-in-class anticancer drug for patients who do not respond to existing anticancer therapies.

These therapies include deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), motor cortex stimulation (MCS), and other related aspects of neural processing. Modeling has included circuitry models of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease and the DBS electrode in a discrete solution; and S1 regions of cortex with cortico-thalamic processing; three-dimensional modeling of the activating function and fibers of passage; and patterns of stimulation and power in tremor control. More recently, we have focused on mechanisms of action to treat chronic pain using high frequency and burst-type spinal cord stimulation as well as work showing how computational models of neural circuitry can be used to help streamline new drug development in major depressive disorder. We have also worked on a new analysis of theoretical changes in information processing in axons of passage through regions using deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease and other disorders. Normally, our work would have been presented at several national and international meetings. This expectation was, of course, quite severely constricted by the COVID-19 pandemic and instead, I gave several webinars or moderated virtual meetings that would have been held in Orlando, Miami, Barcelona, Montreal, and Mumbai. In recent efforts, we have further developed and refined our hypothesis on how high-frequency and other waveforms in stimulation systems modulate axons, both in suppressing or blocking them as well as in stimulating them. We continue to examine the fundamental mechanisms of neuromodulation therapies, an area of rapidly developing technology and innovation. In addition, we have taken on a new project examining more theoretical aspects of neural modeling, and also analysis of health care diagnosis and treatment with an eye toward how artificial intelligence methods might contribute to advancing the field.

We have initiated prospective studies looking at symptomatic improvement with the use of flow diverters, and conducted numerous studies aimed at better dissecting specific aneurysm characteristics and how they would impact treatment outcomes. We have also collaborated with other centers to investigate the utility of flow diversion for the treatment of particular subgroups of aneurysms that usually pose treatment challenges for conventional treatment methods. Cavernous malformations Cavernous malformation are common, yet there is a paucity of data on their natural history or treatment options. We have gathered the largest published cohort of cavernous malformations to date, and have investigated the utility of antiplatelets and statins medication as potential therapeutic options. Management of subdural hematoma We are at the forefront of utilizing embolization techniques to treat subdural hematomas. We are co-leading a number of multi-center trials to determine the safety and efficacy of this novel treatment technique. We have published the largest series in the literature regarding its safety and efficacy, and are investigating this technique in the elderly population and defining the populations that will most benefit from it. Subarachnoid hemorrhage We conduct multiple projects covering many aspects of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Utilizing national databases, we showed that treating unruptured aneurysms leads to a reduction in the risk of aSAH presentation and discovered that treated migraine appears protective for SAH. Our research has identified the importance of maintaining a minimal blood pressure to avoid poor outcomes in SAH. We also initiated imaging studies to determine new biomarkers of SAH complications. Artificial intelligence We have partnered with international AI firms to design new AI-powered algorithms to identify aneurysms with non-invasive imaging and hydrocephalus in neurosurgical patients. Microsimulations Using decision analytic models and Monte Carlo microsimulation studies, we are investigating different cost-effectiveness analysis projects to study the benefits of screening for intracranial aneurysms in different subpopulations with high-risk factors and the optimal screening intervals in these populations. These include female smokers and patients with genetic-predisposing diseases. We are also studying the cost effectiveness of multiple follow-up strategies after flow diversion treatment of intracranial aneurysm. Screening for intracranial aneurysms Our group led an institutional review of the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in women between ages 30-60 who smoke and found that 19.1% have incidental findings of aneurysms, compared to 1.9% in non-smoker counterparts. We led a multi-institutional case control study to validate our findings, confirming the high rate of occurrence of intracranial aneurysms in women who smoke. Our team subsequently performed a decision analytic study documenting the cost effectiveness of screening women who smoke for intracranial aneurysms. 73 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.Basic Laboratory Science We have been exploring the hypothesis that some limitations surrounding neural stem cell transplantation can be overcome by the addition of periventricular endothelial cells (PvECs) from the embryonic brain. This novel concept is the outgrowth of several studies in the area of angiogenesis and neurogenesis, where it is postulated that PvECs migrate in the embryonic brain in a similar manner to neurons, and have a reciprocal relationship in the development of neuronal networks and the vasculature that supports them. We have also been studying the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which has implications from chemotherapy drug administration to traumatic head injury. This work has identified novel mechanisms associated with BBB permeability and will provide the basis for the development of treatments to facilitate and amplify BBB permeability. We have also been studying the underlying molecular alternation in endothelial cells in normal and pathological tissue. We aim to delineate the genetic and molecular signature of these cells as a way to enhance treatment of CNS disease including aneurysms, gliomas, and cerebral metastasis.

San Diego, CA (oral presentation)74 bidmc.org/surgery Neurosurgery Martina of Neurotrauma Neurosurgery Clerkship Director RESEARCH FOCUS My research focuses on triage of complicated mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). As the quality of head CT scans has improved dramatically over the last two decades we now can detect minor brain hemorrhage. However, this leads to the over-triage and over- diagnosis of complicated mild TBI. Routine follow-up head CT has not been shown to improve patient outcome or lead to a change in treatment but is still performed at many institutions. Under the leadership of myself, Carlo Rosen, MD (Emergency Medicine, BIDMC) and Carl Hauser, MD (Acute Care Surgery, Trauma, and Surgical Critical Care, BIDMC) a new protocol has been initiated and is currently being investigated with the goal of avoiding routine follow-up head CTs. Within the first year we could reduce the number of follow-up head CTs in the complicated mild TBI population by 75%. As our society is aging, increasing numbers of elderly people present with TBI. While in this patient population goal-concordant care is very important, it has been shown that few surgeons take the patient's and family's care goals into account. One of my other areas of research is to understand whether training for goal-of-care discussions improves goal- concordant care and also reduces burnout among surgeons.

Arroyo, MD, MPH Associate Professor of Ophthalmology RESEARCH GROUP Efren Gonzalez, Justin WangRESEARCH FOCUS Our research focuses on the development and evaluation of novel ophthalmologic surgical techniques and less invasive treatment options. We also collaborate with a diverse group of scientists who analyze our large ophthalmic tissue repository, develop algorithms predicting visual and anatomical success using retinal imaging, and conduct multi-centered clinical trials for novel therapeutics. Surgical Techniques Much of this past year has been focused on two novel techniques: Endoscopic visualization of the peripheral retina and ciliary body and scleral-fixated intra-ocular lenses. Endoscopic visualization is a valuable tool in vitreoretinal surgery as it provides a unique view that is not limited by media or anterior segment opacities. We recently were invited to author a chapter in the first edition of the Duke Manual for Vitreoretinal Surgery based on this topic and have demonstrated its efficacy in a series of complicated cases. Moreover, we have presented a project comparing a posterior approach to endoscopic photocoagulation (ECP) treatment for glaucoma vs an anterior approach. This project, like many others in our clinic, takes advantage of the supportive and collaborative relationships we share with the other ophthalmologists in our clinic that synthesize our various specialties into the best possible care for our patients. Scleral-fixated intra-ocular lenses are our newest surgical innovation, which aims to reduce the number of subluxed or dislocated artificial lenses. With cataract surgeries continuing to be the most common procedure in the country, methods to deal with their complications are of continuous interest. Our method builds on others' work to better secure the artificial lens in a way that does not expose the intra-ocular space to outside elements. For more detailed information, watch our video: https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=aTeMDZvNDBY. Less-Invasive Treatment Options Most retinal conditions originate from a common source: ischemia. As such, we are currently working on a novel intervention aimed at restoring retinal oxygen levels and combatting the root cause of patients' symptoms. Recently, we have been studying the use of normobaric hyperoxia in patients with diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusions. Our results from short-term three-hour trials show that hyperoxia improves vision and reduces macular edema in these patients. Currently, we are working on expanding our use of normobaric hyperoxia to longer-duration nocturnal trials in these patients. We have also been interested in how supplemental oxygen can improve outcomes in patients with retinal detachments awaiting surgery. In these cases, the photoreceptors are separated from their blood supply and can degenerate due to the hypoxic conditions. We are excited that this treatment has the potential to offer patients an inexpensive and non-invasive option to improve or preserve their vision. 77 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 Presentations Diabetic Macular Edema: When to Treat and When to Observe.

Bouffard, MD Konstantinos Douglas, MD, DVM, MBA Vivian Paraskevi Douglas, MD, DVM, MBA Edsel Ing, MDRESEARCH FOCUS My research in 2020 focused on oculomotor nerve schwannomas (ONS) originating from proliferating nerve sheath cells (Figure 1). These are rare, benign CNS tumors, with a limited number of reports (fewer than 100 cases) in the literature. Unfortunately, very few physicians have sufficient experience in treating non-vestibular schwannomas. The fact that their symptomatology can vary widely, depending on location and size of the lesion, poses an additional challenge. Given the rarity of such non-vestibular, intracranial schwannomas, many physicians may not even consider these lesions when patients present with diplopia. Management options include surgical excision, stereotactically delivered radiation therapy, and symptomatic treatment (strabismus surgery or prisms). There is currently no established management guideline that aids providers in deciding on surgical versus non-surgical management. We, therefore, set out to review the literature on the topic to identify indications for treatment as well as outcome measures (e.g., local control rates and survival rates as well as complication rates) that have been reported as associated with the various treatment modalities. Our collaboration with Tufts Medical Center also yielded four previously unreported cases of ONS that were included in this study (Figure 2). The cohort was divided into one group that had been managed with open microsurgery and a second group that was managed without surgical intervention but with stereotactically delivered radiation therapy (SRS). The data analysis is underway. Our goal is to develop an algorithm for evaluation and treatment of ONS in order to establish consensus on how these tumors should be treated.

I work with single-institution data as well as databases including the National Cancer Database (NCDB) and the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) to provide useful information to both providers and patients. I also conduct translational research at the intersection of surgical simulation, device development, and human performance. I have studied the effects of vibrotactile haptic feedback (and its lack thereof) in robotic surgery on surgical learning in the simulation and live operative room settings. I have also developed technology for the provision of haptic awareness for electrosurgical systems. My current work examines the role of haptic intelligence for surgical performance and learning curves, and I have ongoing collaborations with engineers to develop technologies that can both assess and enhance surgical skill. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted me to apply prior research experience to the development of a simulated cough-generating device for the education of trainees on the risks of aerosol-generating procedures. This device was recognized in a national competition of the American Academy of Otolaryngology. I am also collaborating with Dr. David Edwards at the Harvard John A.

Naples, MD Assistant Professor of Otolaryngology RESEARCH FOCUS History of Otolaryngology Some of my ongoing research involves historical research that aims to understand how medically historical concepts evolved into present day paradigms. I have multiple ongoing research projects looking into the role history played in our understanding of otologic disease. Most recently, I am working to evaluate how theories on sudden hearing loss evolved to create a standard treatment for the disorder today. In addition, I am looking into the historical role of speech-understanding tests as a tool that helped us develop current tests used to evaluate hearing. Cochlear Implant and Cognition One of my ongoing research efforts is to better understand the role of cognition and \"brain function\" in understanding outcomes following cochlear implant surgery for hearing loss. I am currently collaborating with research physicians at Ohio State University to determine if there are cognitive evaluations that perhaps offer insights to how well a patient understands speech after cochlear implant. In conjunction with some of my prior work, the goal of this research is to translate the concept of cognitive testing into the clinical setting as a tool for understanding hearing outcomes.

I am involved in a new multidisciplinary initiative for the management of complex wounds. This program aims to be a center of excellence offering all aspects of wound and burn care, including prevention, acute care, and non-surgical treatments such as laser therapy, hyperbaric therapy, and microsurgical reconstruction. My research interests are in health services, wound and burn surgery, microsurgical outcomes, and the optimization of surgical care in patients at high risk of wound complications. I am the principal investigator on a study of clinical efficacy, cost, and outcomes in sternal reconstruction following cardiac surgery complicated by sternal dehiscence. I have a strong interest in the use of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) in the assessment of surgical efficacy and cost effectiveness. I am leading a study examining PROMs following gender-affirmation surgery at BIDMC\u2014the first time these specific measures have been used in the United States for this purpose. We are using similar PROMs to assess outcomes following common plastic surgery procedures, such as breast reductions and microvascular breast reconstruction, to optimize surgical techniques and postoperative care. Our group is also interested in studying the use of novel imaging technologies to assist in the assessment of wounds and skin flaps used in microsurgical reconstruction. We are studying ways to improve the accuracy of risk stratification in complex wounds by incorporating new technologies such as tissue oxygenation monitoring, ultrasonography, and thermal imaging. With more accurate predictive indices we hope to determine which patients may benefit from earlier surgical intervention to improve long-term outcomes. Deep sternal wound complications following sternotomy represent a complex challenge. Management can involve debridement, flap reconstruction, and rigid fixation. Here we present our novel comprehensive treatment algorithm.89 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 Completed training in the Harvard Combined Plastic Surgery Residency Program Completed fellowship training in Microsurgical Reconstruction at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Achieved board certification in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery from the American Board of Plastic Surgery and in Surgical Critical Care from the American Board of Surgery I am a co-investigator for a recently funded, prospectively randomized study of lymphatic reconstitution and wound healing following free tissue transfer TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION I am strongly engaged in teaching plastic surgery residents in the ambulatory and operative settings. I serve as the primary clinical preceptor for the weekly plastic surgery resident-led clinic at BIDMC and staff most cases planned through the clinic. The goal of the resident clinic is to provide a thorough exposure to pre-operative planning, graded operative autonomy, and post-operative management of both aesthetic and general reconstructive surgery. I am also involved in the weekly journal club and didactics, giving lectures on flap physiology and selection, head and neck reconstruction, maxillofacial trauma, and oral board preparation. In addition, I am mentoring several medical students and general surgery residents who have developed an interest in the field of plastic surgery.

Using two imaging modalities, Fluorescence-Assisted Resection and Exploration (FLARE) system and Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI), we have successfully translated this technology from large animal models to first-in-human clinical trials. In addition, we have collaborated with Dr. Hak Soo Choi (Massachusetts General Hospital) in examining vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) and combining immunohistochemically techniques with our well-developed NIR technologies in order to detect early signs of graft rejection. Other collaborative projects have evaluated near infrared imaging of lymphatic vessels in a large animal model. Our clinical research group is examining outcomes and patient satisfaction after breast cancer and reconstructive surgery. We have also been examining patient access, health literacy, and readability of resources for plastic surgery in collaboration with Dr. Rima Rudd (Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health). Near Infrared Imaging Systems Our most recent studies have focused on using the FLARE system to examine perfusion in large animal models. Using a novel liquid latex- indocyanine green combination in a cadaver swine model, we have delineated the vascular anatomy for composite whole-eye transplantation. This work serves as the basis for future studies examining vascular composite allotransplantation of the eye in a large animal model. Patient Access and Health Literacy in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery In the area of health literacy and patient access, the AMA and NIH guidelines are for patient-directed health literature to be written at a sixth-grade level. Unfortunately, most patient resources are well above this level. Our group has examined online patient resources and their readability for patients not only in the English-speaking population but also in the Spanish-speaking population. We have been working to examine health literacy in OpenNotes and how this impacts health communication. Finally, our group is designing new patient materials and patient apps at the appropriate reading levels for patient education. This extends to patient education through telehealth, which has been extensively used during the COVID-19 pandemic, but not studied.

Comer, MD Samuel M. Manstein, MD Eric Shiah, BA Elizabeth Laikhter, BA RESEARCH FOCUS Over the past year, my focus continues to be on both basic and clinical research across a spectrum of disciplines in plastic and reconstructive surgery. These collaborative projects utilize the expertise of scientists, engineers, and clinicians. Our main collaborators include: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Tufts University, Massachusetts General Hospital/Wellman Center for Photomedicine, and University of California San Diego Bioengineering. Electrochemical Activation and Inhibition of Neuromuscular Systems with Modulation of Ion Concentrations Using Ion-Selective Membranes This project is an ongoing collaborative effort with MIT since 2008. Our pilot data was published in Nature Materials in October 2011. Our primary focus is the development of an electrochemical nerve stimulation and blocking method via local modulation of ion concentrations at the peripheral nerve surface using a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device. Our goal is to fabricate innovative neuroprosthetic devices that can reduce nerve stimulation thresholds to aid in paralysis/paresis and/or block nerve firing, and to reduce pain for conditions such as facial nerve paralysis, chronic pain, and nerve dysfunction syndromes. Use of Silk-Based Orthopedic Devices to Modulate Healing I am co-principal investigator on this R01 funded project, which is a collaborative effort with scientists and engineers at Tufts University. We are developing degradable silk protein-based orthopedic devices (screws and plates). Our pilot data was published in Nature Communications in March 2014 and an updated report was published in Nature Materials in January 2020. These devices may be able to provide immediate surgical stabilization for orthopedic repair, promote active repair, reduce infections by releasing therapeutics, and degrade fully, thereby reducing the need for future removal surgery. Use of Novel Oxygen-Sensing, Paint-On Liquid Bandage for Tissue-Oxygenation Monitoring This project is a collaborative effort with the Massachusetts General Hospital/Wellman Center for Photomedicine in which we are developing a novel oxygen-sensing, paint-on liquid bandage (Figure 1) for use in perioperative tissue-oxygenation monitoring following microvascular free-tissue reconstruction. Our pilot animal model data was published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in July 2017. Results of our first human trial for DIEP flap reconstruction were published in Science Advances in December 2020. This technology may be able to address limitations in current tissue oxygenation monitoring. It has the potential to improve flap failure rates by providing timely and accurate data to guide decision making. 3D Printing in Plastic Surgery We have focused on other applications of 3D printing, e.g. 3D printed surgical tools for use in plastic surgery either through customized implants or surgical planning. Potential applications in regards to our other basic science research include the use of 3D printing for the production of silk screws and plates. Outcomes Research in Plastic Surgery We have an active clinical research group examining outcomes, techniques, and patient satisfaction following reconstructive and aesthetic plastic surgery procedures. Using institutional databases at BIDMC, as well as national databases from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), we have examined risk factors for complications, trends over time, healthcare disparities, and performed cost analysis.

Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Dhruv Singhal, MD Associate Professor of Surgery Co-Director, Boston Lymphatic Center Director, Lymphatic Surgery, BIDMC RESEARCH FOCUS Over the last several years my clinical and basic science research has primarily been focused on the surgical prevention and treatment of lymphedema. Our research program continues to grow with the unparalleled support from the BIDMC FIRST (Facilitating Innovative Research & Surgical Trials) team. As we evaluated our 1000th new patient in the BIDMC Lymphatic Center this past summer, our robust quality improvement database continues to grow. Similarly, our biorepository houses more than 300 samples of healthy and diseased lymphatic tissue. Our clinical research this past year focused on defining anatomic variations of the lymphatic system, especially of the upper extremity. Moreover, we continued our study on immediate lymphatic reconstruction with a cost-effectiveness article published in Annals of Surgery. In the laboratory, we continue to refine our animal model to investigate the physiology of preventing lymphedema surgically at the time of lymphadenectomy. Specifically, we are utilizing unique lymphatic-specific dyes to report real-time changes in lymphatic flow from an extremity.

Giurini, DPM Associate Clinical Professor of Surgery Chief, Division of Podiatric Surgery RESEARCH GROUP Kevin Kevin L. Riemer, DPM Barry DPM Lowell Tong, DPM Aristidis Veves, MD, DSc RESEARCH FOCUS The Division of Podiatric Surgery participates in translational as well as clinical research. Translational (\"bench to bedside\") research focuses on causes of neuropathy and impaired wound healing and is led by Aristidis Veves, MD, DSc, a leading scientist and researcher. Dr. Veves has been the recipient of several NIH grants and works collaboratively with the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering of Harvard University. His work has been published in prestigious journals such as Diabetes, Circulation and The Lancet . The rest of our faculty members are involved in clinical research that largely focuses on diabetes and its complications. They also participate in outcomes research that address surgical and clinical conditions for which there are no clear treatment algorithms. This research draws from our own clinical cases and experience. With the assistance of the Department of Surgery's FIRST program, we have been able to expand our ability to conduct this type of research. A major focus of our clinical research is to involve all of our residents and to instill in them a mentality of research, to ask questions, and to work toward answers. This begins in their first year. In 2020, we initiated three studies examining clinical questions that are encountered every day but do not have clear answers. Two of these studies are being conducted collaboratively with two other departments at BIDMC (Orthopedic Surgery and Anesthesia). During 2020 we are continuing our work on four other studies, which are in various stages of completion. We expect to submit our results for publication for two of these studies in 2021.

My main research field is diabetes and its complications, with the main emphasis on wound healing and cardiovascular disease. Approximately 90 percent of my time is dedicated to research, five percent to teaching, and five percent to administrative and other professional activities. Translational research is a major part of my research activities. My work mainly focuses on the pathogenesis of diabetic foot ulceration and the subsequent impairment of wound healing. This work has been supported by the NIH and nonprofit organizations. I collaborate with investigators from departments throughout BIDMC and investigators from other institutions, such as the Wyss Institute at Harvard University, Joslin Diabetes Center, MIT, Boston University, and Brigham and Women's Hospital. I conduct investigator-initiated research studies that examine the effects of various FDA-approved medications on cardiovascular function. These industry-funded studies have been conceived, designed, and executed by my unit and focus on possible new mechanisms by which these medications exert their beneficial effects. I have also served as the lead investigator and lead author in industry-sponsored multicenter trials that investigated the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions for the management of diabetic foot ulceration. I also run my own basic research laboratory that mainly explores the findings of this translational research and tries to identify mechanisms underlying the observed results. My laboratory works closely with other laboratories at BIDMC and is funded by NIH grants. I also collaborate with Dr. David Mooney's laboratory at the Wyss Institute and the Harvard School of Engineering and Dr. Jonathan Garlick's laboratory at Tufts University School of Medicine. The main aim of our collaboration, which has resulted in NIH funding, is the development of new wound-healing products. The results of my research have been published in prestigious medical journals, including Lancet, Diabetes , and Circulation . According to Google Scholar as of December 2020, my work has resulted in more than 22,300 citations; an h-index of 74 and i10-index of 177. I have also served as Director of the Rongxiang Xu, MD Center for Regenerative Therapeutics since its establishment in 2015. The center was established with a generous donation from the National Rongxiang Xu Foundation to help further its mission to advance the treatment of patients throughout the world with chronic wounds, burns, and other conditions resulting from a failure of tissue repair and regeneration. As part of its mission, the center provides resources for collaborative bench-to-bedside research with investigators worldwide, as well as the education of physicians and scientists internationally. ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 This year we continued to focus on understanding the pathophysiology of impaired diabetic wound healing. To this end, we applied a combined understanding of single cell transcriptome and proteome levels that has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding in an agnostic way regarding the interaction of individual cells in the expression of various genes and production of proteins associated with wound healing. In this project, which is funded by DiaComp, we are comparing single cell transcriptome and proteome profiling of cells from forearm and foot skin biopsies and blood from healthy, non-DM subjects and DM patients with healed and non-healed DFU. We also evaluate 101 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.Aristidis Veves, MD, DSc Rongxiang Xu, MD, Professor of Surgery in the Field of Regenerative Medicine Director, BIDMC Rongxiang Xu, MD Center for Regenerative Therapeuticssingle cell protein expression, mainly the expression of proteins known to be expressed in specific cells and involved in the wound-healing process. In addition, in an agnostic way, we compare the expression of the most highly expressed proteins among the various groups. We have almost completed the study; the first data analysis has provided very interesting insight regarding the role of specific cell types, such as a subgroup of fibroblasts, in promoting wound healing. A patent application is under development. We already performed transcriptomic analysis in a portion of the collected samples and published our results, which showed that there are similarities in the gene expression between the forearm and foot skin specimens of the same subjects. We will conduct additional studies to further investigate the role of various genes in the development of chronic, non-healing wounds. We also continue subject recruitment in another NIH-funded study that aims to investigate the association between dermal macrophage infiltration/polarization and mast cell activation with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular remodeling in elderly diabetic patients. Work is progressing well and we expect the first results soon. We have almost completed data analysis of another NIH-funded project that investigates how the tissue microenvironment modulates the functional activation of inflammatory (M1) or pro-regenerative macrophages (M2) to direct wound healing in 3D, in vitro skin- like tissues, the propensity of immune cells from diabetic mice to polarize to the M1 versus M2 phenotype in vivo , and their impact on diabetic wound healing. This project also aims to develop and test the ability of biomaterials capable of localized, sequential release of factors to recruit macrophages and then direct these cells to the M2 phenotype to enhance diabetic wound healing. Finally, we initiated a new project to develop advanced wound healing products. I am a co-PI of this project, funded by DARPA, which is led by Columbia University and includes investigators from MIT, Virginia University, Northwestern University, and IBM. I also participate in an SBIR grant that evaluates the efficacy of RNA interference in promoting wound healing in diabetes. TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION My teaching responsibilities include participation in the training of podiatry residents, supervision of the fellows and junior faculty in my laboratory, and participation in mentorship committees of junior faculty members from other units. I am also involved in educational activities of the Center for Education at BIDMC, which provides guidance to candidates for NIH K-series awards. Finally, I participated as series editor, book editor, or co-editor and author in numerous textbooks. Currently, I participate as editor in the third edition of the textbooks Diabetic Neuropathy and Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease.SELECTED RESEARCH SUPPORT Skin Inflammatory Phenotypes as Biomarkers of Novel sshRNA-antimiR Combination Therapy for Accelerating Healing of Diabetic Foot Ulcers.

Cummings, PhD Per-Olof Hasselgren, MD, PhD Leo Magrini, BA Michiya Nishino, MD, PhDRESEARCH FOCUS Over the past several decades there has been a substantial increase in the diagnosis and treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer. This rise has largely been attributed to increased detection of nonaggressive and nonlethal thyroid cancers. It has been suggested that this rise has resulted in an epidemic of overtreatment of thyroid cancer. My research has focused on a combination of population-level analysis of thyroid cancer incidence and treatment patterns; an evaluation of the surgical, financial and quality of life impact of surgical treatment of thyroid cancer; and the development of new translational approaches to the evaluation of thyroid nodules. Differential Glycosylation Patterns in Papillary Thyroid Cancer Thyroid nodules are a common clinical encounter, found in as high as 68% of the population by ultrasound detection. When evaluated by fine needle aspiration, roughly 2-5% are diagnosed as malignant and 55-74% are classified as benign. However, the remaining biopsies are reported as cytologically indeterminate. The risk of malignancy in these indeterminate categories can range anywhere from 10-30%. As a result, a large number of patients may be subjected to surgery solely for the purpose of obtaining a diagnosis, which is often benign. The focus of investigations over the past 15 years aimed at delineating cases of indeterminate pathology has revolved almost exclusively around finding clinically relevant molecular markers capable of distinguishing between benign and malignant tissue. These commercially available tests have proven beneficial as rule-out tests. However, their positive predictive value has been as low as 50%, making their clinical utility, when positive, not as useful. Recent research aimed at understanding cancer pathogenesis and progression has focused on the topic of glycosylation, the post-translational process of adding glycan moieties to non-carbohydrate structures such as proteins or lipids. More important is the promise that by understanding differences in glycosylation patterns, glycobiomarkers for human cancers can be identified. Differences in glycosylation have been studied in virtually all types of cancers, including brain and lung; however, this has yet to be systematically studied for papillary thyroid cancer. Our lab has begun to evaluate glycosylation patterns in benign thyroid tissue and papillary thyroid cancer. Preliminary unpublished results of N- and O-glycans suggest a large difference in glycosylation in papillary thyroid cancer compared to benign thyroid tissue. Specifically, markedly elevated levels of unmodified (non-Fuc/ Sia) core-2 (bisected) N-glycans were seen in papillary thyroid cancer. Based on these findings, we will continue to evaluate Financial Burden of Thyroid Cancer Psychological and Financial Hardship of Thyroid Cancer Patients 103 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.these differences by validating our initial findings and expanding our evaluation of the glycosylation profile in cancerous thyroid nodules. Our hope is that over the coming years, we may be able to develop a diagnostic tool that may aid in definitely distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid nodules. Quality of Life and Economic Impact of Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis Cancer care expenditure in the U.S. continues to rise yearly and is projected to surpass $150 billion by 2020. Although thyroid cancer has a generally high survival rate, it is associated with a potential long-term financial and psychological impact, which has not previously been rigorously studied. We aimed to evaluate the comparative prevalence of financial and psychological hardship among U.S. thyroid cancer and non-thyroid cancer survivors. In an evaluation using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), we found that thyroid cancer survivors experience a significantly higher level of both material and psychological financial hardship compared to non-thyroid cancer survivors. These findings suggest that financial hardship may be under-recognized in the medical community and warrants further investigation into the etiology of the financial burden associated with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer ( Surgery 2020). As a result of these findings, we evaluated our own population of thyroid cancer survivors over the past 20 years at BIDMC and found a significant number of survivors report lost income, financial worry, medical stress, and career stress related to their diagnosis. These findings are currently in submission. Treatment Patterns in Thyroid Cancer Over the past 15 years, there has been a growing body of literature suggesting a rising incidence of thyroid cancer without a rise in mortality. As a result, there has been a shift in guidelines to offer less aggressive surgical intervention. These recommendations have come as multiple studies have shown that patients with thyroid cancer may have a similar prognosis when undergoing less aggressive surgical intervention such thyroid lobectomy. Our group hypothesized that despite evidence of equivalent survival with less aggressive treatment, patients are still undergoing aggressive surgeries for the treatment of thyroid cancer regardless of the size of the cancer. Our findings have shown that the incidence of total thyroidectomy has not decreased over the past 15 years despite recommendations encouraging consideration of lobectomy for patients with small papillary thyroid cancers.

The goal is to derive best practices, determine optimal pathways, and develop innovations in care delivery that improve quality for patients with breast cancer. The program integrates health care services research, quality improvement, health care delivery science, and implementation science. Innovations in decision-support, patient care models, and patient education are employed to advance care and outcomes. We use a variety of clinical databases, patient-reported outcomes, and real-world data sources to critically appraise results and establish best practices. Outcomes include traditional clinical metrics in breast cancer (e.g., survival, complications, local recurrence), as well as patient well-being, satisfaction, functional status, and impact on the health-care system. The results then \"translate\" into practice and policy by working with clinicians, professional societies, patients, and health-care system leaders. Outcomes research seeks to understand the end results of particular health-care practices and interventions. By linking the care people get to the outcomes they experience, outcomes research has become the key to developing better ways to monitor and improve the quality of care. * No longer at BIDMC105 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 National Institutes of Health grant funding to support research initiatives National Cancer Database research awards Harvard research awards Invited podium presentations at multiple national surgical research meetings Peer-reviewed publications in high-impact surgical journals TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION Our research fellow completed a Master of Science in Epidemiology degree program, a 42.5 credit program with the goal of training clinicians with the quantitative skills needed for a clinical research career.

As part of the Fibrosis and Endometriosis Research Program (FERP), my laboratory dissects the alterations of immune niche and heme pathway in endometriosis and ovarian carcinoma. Our work has implications for understanding novel targets and potential therapeutics for treatment of cancer and beyond. Below are examples of the ongoing projects in my laboratory: 1. We study the role of labile heme and its scavenger, hemopexin (Hx), in tumor microenvironment as well as a role of heme:G4 complexes in gene regulation. We have recently discovered that sequestration of labile heme by Hx may block heme- driven tumor growth and metastases, suggesting a potential strategy to prevent and/ or arrest cancer dissemination. This work was published in Cell Reports (Canesin, Di Ruscio et al, 2020) and featured on the journal cover ( Figure 2 ). We demonstrated that labile heme promotes tumor growth and metastases in an orthotopic murine model of prostate cancer, with the most aggressive phenotype detected in mice lacking Hx. Mechanistically, labile heme accumulated in the nucleus and modulated specific gene expression via interacting with guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA structures to promote colony growth. In this work we identified c-MYC as an heme:G4-regulated gene and a major player in heme-driven cancer progression. Numerous implications that arise from this study include: 1) the potential use of heme levels as a biomarker for prostate cancer patients; 2) the reclassification of heme (i.e., red meat or treatment with heme arginate) as a DNA intercalating agent able to turn on oncogene expression and metastatic gene expression profile via interaction with G4; 3) the use of Hx and BG4 as clinical biomarkers associated with cancer dissemination in prostate malignancies. 2. Much of our efforts over the years have been directed toward understanding how the enzymes involved in heme degradation (biliverdin reductase/BVR and heme oxygenase-1/HO-1) and the products (carbon monoxide, biliverdin/bilirubin, iron) control metabolism and gene regulation in both immune and cancer cells. We continue work on the role of HO-1 and BVR in tumor microenvironment and its impact on anti-cancer responses to immunotherapy. Our recently published work using BVR conditional knockout mice describes a novel mechanism of BVR in regulating macrophage chemotaxis in response to C5a via a regulatory mechanism involving, in part, C5aR1 signaling. Conditional deletion of BVR in macrophages turns on a specific set of genes associated with chemotaxis, RANTES and IP-10. We have identified BVR as a novel regulator of C5aR in vitro and in vivo . This work provides novel findings that explain, in part, an immunoregulatory function of BVR and the phenotype of mice with deletion of BVR in models of endotoxemia (Wegiel et al, JBC 2009, Wegiel et al, PNAS 2011). 3. We study the role of sterile- and bacteria-induced inflammation in organ injury and cancer. Our prior work showed the role of exogenous CO and HO-1 in models of sterile and bacterial infection (Wegiel et al, JCI 2013). Recently, we discovered that the protective effects of CO and HO-1 in models of sterile or bacteria-induced prostate inflammation are, in part, via induction of the lipid metabolic enzyme, ACSL1. Lipid metabolism is an emerging target during cancer progression and inflammation. Our FIGURE 1 109 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.findings may drive possible development of drugs targeting metabolic reprogramming in context to early inflammatory and proliferative changes in the prostate. The approaches we are currently pursuing in the laboratory include: The role of the heme degradation and heme scavenger pathways in modulating inflammatory responses in sterile and pathogen-induced carcinogenesis and genotoxic stress Metabolic control of inflammation in cancer and the role of HO-1 metabolic pathway in controlling responses to immunotherapy The role of biliverdin reductase and bile pigments in cancer and sterile inflammation- induced organ injury DNA damage, replication, and gene expression regulation by heme and secondary structures of DNA in cancer and diseases Role of heme in endometriosis through the collaborative efforts via FERP across Harvard ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 Ad-hoc reviewer of NIH (Transplant Tolerance Tumor Immunology TTT, special emphasis panels) and DOD Member of American Association for Cancer Research, BIDMC Cancer Research Institute, and Dana-Farber/ Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Editorial Board member, American Journal of Pathology, Gastrointestinal and Liver Biology Guest Associate Editor, special edition: \"Oxidative Stress, Antioxidants, Transcription Factors, and Assimilation in Section Editor-in-Chief of Cancer Immunology Immunotherapy, Cancers (Basel) Honorary Lecturer in Molecular Oncology, Aston University, UKTEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION During the last two years, I have been a supervisor for one PhD student, and one junior faculty member (Instructor).

To date, our department maintains the largest TBM registry in the United States, which has enabled us to develop current guidelines and analyze outcomes for medical, endoscopic, and surgical therapy. Through this analysis, we hope to delineate best care practices through refined patient selection methods and improved medical, endoscopic, and surgical techniques. Our group is keenly interested in understanding the processes that lead to the pathologic laxity in the central airway walls that is a hallmark of TBM. In collaboration with Paul Vanderlaan, MD, PhD, in the Department of Pathology, we analyzed resected tracheal specimens including TBM and different diseases and identified unique pro-remodeling and pro-inflammatory gene expression signatures in those with TBM. Building on this, Dr. Rani Singh has generated a first-in-human TBM transcriptomic signature for TBM (Figure 1) using bulk tissue RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on airway biopsies. Among other differentially expressed genes (+ 2-fold, p<0.05), categories related to epithelium properties proline- rich proteins and keratin (KRT) gene family were enriched. The downregulated genes in TBM suggest their role in the dysregulation of humoral immune response and potassium ion transport, which might influence B-cell development, activation, and differentiation. Further investigation is underway to validate the transcriptomic signature we have obtained using biopsy tissue of TBM and non-TBM subjects. The plan is to confirm the gene expression signatures of candidate genes from RNAseq at mRNA level by using qRT-PCR and at protein level by performing Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry assays on the biopsy tissues and tracheobronchial (TB) wash cells of TBM and non-TBM subjects. In addition, given that the bulk RNA sequencing and pathway analysis results suggest that SPRR and KRT proteins may be the end products rather than components of the initial inflammatory events, we are planning to study whether mRNA-based gene signatures captured in RNAseq are translated and detectable at the protein level and if there are specific upstream pathway regulators in tracheobronchial wash and serum of TBM patients. We continue to collaborate with Lucy Zhang, PhD, at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, to expand the scope of our research in airway flow simulations. This analysis applied computational fluid FIGURE 1: TBP and changes in airflow characteristics using new modeling skills.111 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.dynamics (CFD) in a 3-D computational model of trachea to analyze pre- and post- tracheobronchoplasty (TBP) surgery airflow characteristics. This data provided significant insights on airflow behavior and a better understanding of why and how patients are improving. In the future, we imagine this could lead to a deep understanding of the relationship between TBP and changes in airflow characteristics using new modeling skills. I have been investigating novel methods of treating lung cancer utilizing near-infrared imaging technology. We completed a \"Phase 2, Single-Dose, Open-Label, Exploratory Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of OTL38 Injection for Intraoperative Imaging of Folate Receptor Positive Lung Nodules\" clinical trial in 2019. Patients enrolled in the study were administered a single dose of OTL38, a folate analog ligand conjugated with an indole cyanine-like green dye. During their procedure as indicated by standard of care, an imaging system equipped with near-infrared technology was used to aid in malignancy detection. This phase 2 study has been published and was presented at the 2020 Annual Meeting of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, winning the J. Maxwell Chamberlain Memorial Paper for General Thoracic Surgery. The phase 3 study has just opened at BIDMC.

As part of our collaboration with interventional pulmonology, we continue to build on an existing database so that we can learn more about the etiology, natural disease process with and without intervention, and surgical outcomes\u2014and increase the recognition of this rare disease. We are currently working on developing and validating a quality of life questionnaire for adult tracheobronchomalacia so that we can better follow our patients' outcomes in the future. Lung Cancer Screening I am a member of the Department of Public Health Lung Cancer Screening Work Group and am interested in combating lung cancer screening disparities. There are many opportunities for focus groups; pilot implementation projects; and hospital, state, and national level interventions that could help us better understand and mitigate lung cancer screening disparities.

I am excited to continue this work in collaboration with colleagues at BIDMC and Harvard Medical School and the rich research environment of which they are a part, as well as with my colleagues at UAB. There is an inadequate supply of organs from deceased human donors, which severely limits the number of organ transplants that can be performed each year. Xenotransplantation\u2014using pigs as sources of organs\u2014if successful, would resolve this continuing problem. However, the primate immune response to a pig organ has proven to be rapid and severe, and overcoming this barrier has been the focus of this research group. Progress has been made, largely through the availability of increasingly sophisticated genetically engineered pigs, and the introduction of novel immunosuppressive agents. The basic strategies employed in designing these genetically engineered pigs is the deletion of antigens that are targeted by the immune response and/or the addition of \"protective\" genes.

The number of people waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant continues to rise, far outpacing the number of potential organ donors. Together with colleagues at BIDMC, the New England Donor Services, and several other transplant programs in the United States, we are developing and evaluating novel strategies to increase rates of both living and deceased donation. These strategies address individual and systems barriers we have identified through earlier research that are associated with lower organ donation rates. How Can We Reduce Persistent Racial and Economic Disparities in Transplantation? Some minorities and low-income patients, relative to white patients and those with more financial resources: a) experience more kidney transplant access barriers, b) are more likely to have initiated dialysis at time of transplant referral, c) wait longer for a deceased donor transplant, d) are less likely to receive a live donor kidney transplant, e) have higher mortality rates on the waiting list, and f) have less optimal transplant outcomes. Since the proportion of patients on the kidney transplant waiting list is increasing for racial/ethnic minorities (while declining for whites), the shortage of deceased donor kidneys is likely to exacerbate these transplant disparities in the years ahead. We are conducting studies to better understand the precise causes of these disparities, to evaluate novel strategies for mitigating them, and to examine the impact of policy changes on these disparities. The success of our research program is due largely to the collaborative partnerships we have with federal and state governments; organ procurement organizations; and researchers from diverse professional backgrounds, including behavioral and medical sciences, public health, surgery, bioethics, nursing, and health services.

Crociani, MPH Da David Jiang, MD Allison Kleeman Yu-Chen Liu Andrew Wagner, MD Adrian Waisman, MDRESEARCH FOCUS My research focus is in urologic cancer, and is highly collaborative in nature, most importantly within BIDMC, but also with outside institutions. I work very closely with Andrew Wagner, MD, and together we co-lead the Urology research team and share research personnel. As Director of the BIDMC Prostate Cancer Center, I will describe my research efforts to optimize quality-of-life in prostate cancer patients. I also am very active clinically in the surgical treatment of bladder cancer, and have a more recent research focus on radical cystectomy. Prostate Cancer Quality-of-life assessment in prostate cancer patients At BIDMC, we are committed to giving every patient with prostate cancer a chance to have the best quality of life possible. Unfortunately, prostate cancer treatment can cause significant side effects, and doctors tend to underestimate how bad these are, potentially leaving patients with long-lasting quality of life problems. My research focuses on accurate and objective measurement of prostate cancer quality of life using patient- reported outcome questionnaires. I developed a new questionnaire called \"EPIC for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP),\" designed to be used by clinicians rather than researchers (Chang P et al, J Urol, Sep 2011). I recently showed that EPIC-CP can allow a doctor to estimate the chances of a patient recovering sexual function after prostate cancer surgery (Chipman et al, J Urol, Mar 2014). Due to its development here at BIDMC, our institution is at the forefront of using EPIC-CP as part of prostate cancer care. I published our results on the \"real-world\" use of EPIC-CP in post-surgery patients in the Journal of Urology (Wagner AA et al, J Urol, Jan 2017), and the instrument continues to be used as both a clinical and research tool throughout the nation. Quality-of-life outcomes after prostate cancer treatment I am also interested in finding out what problems patients have after different treatments (surgery, external radiation, radioactive seed implants), and determining whether we can use this information to better guide patients toward optimal treatments. I am the Co-overall Principal Investigator of the PROST-QA study. This is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study that has the most complete and rigorous collection of prostate cancer quality-of-life data in the world. I recently published the results of a study showing that a subset of patients have improvement in their quality of life after prostate cancer treatment, specifically radical prostatectomy (Chang P et al, J Urol, Feb 2017). Helping prostate cancer patients make treatment decisions Unlike other cancers, in which options may be limited after initial diagnosis, prostate cancer patients face a seemingly impossible task of choosing among several treatment options. Working with Donna Berry, PhD, RN (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), I serve as BIDMC site-responsible Principal Investigator for an NIH R01-funded randomized trial called Personal Patient Profile - Prostate (P3P). This unique study investigates the effectiveness of a web-based interactive program that gathers patient characteristics, quality-of-life (using EPIC-CP), personal preferences, and priorities, and uses this information to customize videos that counsel patients on how to discuss these issues with their doctors. We published our results in the Journal of Urology (Berry et al, J Urol, Jul 2017).123 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 Funding from the Martin and Diane Trust Career Development Chair in Surgery helped me complete two research studies on prostate cancer quality of life, both of which resulted in primary author publications in the Journal of Urology in 2017.

Using Observational Data for Comparative Effectiveness Research When Clinical Trial Evidence is Limited Although randomized clinical trials are the preferred study design to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of interventions, there are very few trials comparing surgical treatments within genitourinary oncology, in part due to the difficulty of conducting surgical trials. To address such fundamental evidence gaps, I am interested in the application of two novel observational research methods when clinical trial evidence is limited: emulation of target clinical trials using observational datasets, and transportation of inferences from completed clinical trials to \"real-world\" patient populations. Together with biostatistics collaborators, we are applying the emulation framework to the study of kidney, prostate, and bladder cancer. For example, in one completed study, we emulated a trial of radical nephrectomy with lymph node dissection versus radical nephrectomy alone using the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to evaluate the survival benefit of lymphadenectomy. Concurrently, we are extending inferences from a completed trial of lymph node dissection in kidney cancer, EORTC 30881, to real-world target populations in the NCDB using transportability methods developed by one of my collaborators, Issa Dahabreh, MD, MS, ScD. Additional studies are ongoing to apply emulation and transportability methods to other disease settings. Development of Deep Learning Methods to Improve Diagnosis and Risk-Stratification Deep learning methods have emerged in recent years as a powerful approach to the classification of medical images, including radiologic images and histopathology. In a study with collaborators at Brown University (supported by NIGMS/Advance-CTR, U54GM115677), we developed a deep learning algorithm for the histopathologic diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer core biopsy specimens. The model demonstrated 91.5% accuracy at classification of image patches as benign versus malignant, and 85.4% accuracy at classification of image patches as benign vs. Gleason 3 vs. Gleason 4 vs. Gleason 5\u2014performance that is to the interobserver variability for Gleason grading among pathologists. Additional studies are ongoing to expand applications of such deep learning algorithms.

Our research team works closely with colleagues within BIDMC as well as collaborators at outside institutions. Due to the high prevalence of kidney stones and the increasing costs associated with its management, we examined variations in percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) cost and predictors of high- procedures (Leow et al, Can Urol Assoc J 2018). Additionally, we are examining factors that affect follow-up patterns of patients presenting to the emergency room with renal colic. Our goal is to improve efficiency of care delivery for patients with nephrolithiasis by incorporating clinical variables and artificial intelligence models to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from earlier surgical intervention. We have also initiated a prospective endourologic database that will examine stone characteristics of patients treated at our center. Surgical Education Another area of my clinical investigation focuses on evaluating learning curves for attaining calyceal access utilizing ultrasound guidance in percutaneous renal stone surgery. Incorporation of ultrasound in renal stone surgery has been shown to lower radiation exposure to patients, surgeons, and ancillary health providers when performing PCNL.

LUTS secondary to BPH negatively impact the quality of life of 210 million men globally, accounting for significant life years lost. In our research, we clinically evaluate the mechanisms of resistance to 5 -reductase inhibitor, finasteride, one of the more common drugs used to manage BPH and associated LUTS. Ongoing work in our lab has focused on steroid 5 -reductase 2 (SRD5A2, aka: 5-reductase 2 [5AR2]), the enzyme responsible for prostatic development and growth. Our investigations have revealed that expression of SRD5A2 is variable and, in fact, 30% of men do not express SRD5A2 in prostate tissues. In previous work, we showed that somatic suppression of SRD5A2 during adulthood is dependent on epigenetic changes associated with methylation of the promoter region of the SRD5A2 gene. Our studies indicate that: 1) methylation of the SRD5A2 is regulated by direct binding of the DNA-methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1) protein to methylation of the SRD5A2 promoter region; 3) clinical conditions associated with increased inflammation, age, and obesity are associated with decreased expression of SRD5A via epigenetic modification; 4) in the absence of pathways are blocked, alternate estrogenic pathways are upregulated, leading to an androgenic-to-estrogenic switch in the prostate gland, thus creating alternate pathways for prostatic growth. Therefore, we hypothesize that absence of SRD5A2 as a result of somatic methylation is directly responsible for lack of sensitivity to 5ARI therapy in men with BPH. To demonstrate the clinical significance of epigenetic changes to SRD5A2 and confirm its role in regulating sensitivity to 5ARI treatment, we propose the following aims: Specific Aim 1 : To assess the role of 5-AR2 expression in the development of resistance to 5ARI therapy. Specific Aim 2 : To demonstrate that SRD5A2 methylation turns on estrogen pathways and affects sensitivity to 5ARI therapies in men with BPH. Specific Aim 3 : To determine that prostatic inflammation is associated with methylation of SRD5A2 promoter. Our findings have broad implications for the development of predictive biomarker assays that can be used to evaluate resistance to BPH-related therapies and allow clinicians to select alternate therapies for managing the most common proliferative disorder affecting men worldwide.Aria F.

Rayala, MD, PhD Assistant Professor of Surgery RESEARCH GROUP Alejandro Abello, MD Heather Faulkner, MD Taisha MSc Ketan Sheth, MDRESEARCH FOCUS Cancer Screening Disparities in Health Safety Net Populations In collaboration with colleagues at Cambridge Health Alliance, we identified patient populations within a Health Safety Net health system that were at risk in screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer. Our current work is focused on assessing factors that contribute to reduced screening for colorectal cancer in a Health Safety Net population. We are studying how a patient's \"race\" differs from \"ethnicity,\" and querying whether broadly grouping ethnicities within the small census-defined \"race\" categories can obfuscate important differences. We have found that our non-English-speaking patients have higher colorectal screening rates when compared to their English-speaking counterparts, and are analyzing whether factors such as substance abuse and mental health may contribute to reduced screening in this unique patient population. Impact of Language Barriers on Patient Satisfaction in a Health Safety Net Population We seek to assess patient satisfaction and understanding in our non-English-speaking patients in an ambulatory clinic setting through a text message-based platform. Areas of interest include how language barriers impact a patient's satisfaction with an ambulatory encounter and the patient's assessment of the success of the medical team in communicating the medical plan. Medical Student Education and Early Exposure to Surgical Careers As an instructor for courses and workshops at Harvard Medical School, I have continued to promote surgery as a field of medicine that can provide a supportive and nurturing career path. In my role as Co-Director for Harvard Medical School's Introduction to Suturing, my colleagues and I are now assessing student interest in surgery before and after the workshop to determine whether the workshop has a positive impact on students' interest in the field of surgery. 131 2020 Surgery Research ReportACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 Educational Instruction Course Instructor for the Harvard Medical School Practice of Medicine Introduction to the GU exam Co-Director of the Harvard Medical School Suturing Workshop Other Accomplishments Harvard Medical School Admissions Committee Member Promotion to Assistant Professor of Surgery Boston's Top Doctors, Urology; Castle Connolly and Boston Magazine , 2020 TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION In 2020, I began my role as supervising attending for the resident-run Genitourinary Clinic. In this unique role, I am able to merge my interest in providing the best possible care to underserved patients with my love of teaching. During our busy weekly clinic, I work with the residents to teach methods for smooth clinic flow, clinic documentation, billing, and time management. I support their education on general urology topics that they might not be exposed to in the operating room. Most importantly, I share my joy in caring for these underserved patients. In my private clinics, I offer a longitudinal urology clinic experience for internal medicine residents interested in pursuing primary care. I mentor a rotating series of residents, providing tips and tools for approaching the medical management of common urologic problems.INVITED PRESENTATIONS Medical Management of BPH, Harvard Primary Care Internal Medicine CME Course, Boston, MA Prostate Cancer Screening: System-based Workflows.

We recently published our findings evaluating recovery trends after minimally invasive partial nephrectomy and radical nephrectomy, finding patients routinely require at least six weeks for full recovery. We also presented our multicenter study evaluating the use of aspirin during robotic partial nephrectomy, a surgery notorious for bleeding risk. We found a slightly higher risk of bleeding and complications in these patients, however the continuation of aspirin appeared to be safe. Our team is also interested in non-operative approaches to small renal masses. A collaboration with researchers at Johns Hopkins University and Columbia University, the DISSRM trial (Delayed Intervention and Surveillance for Small Renal Masses) is a multicenter prospective study evaluating the role of surveillance and surgery of small kidney tumors over time. Our 10-year outcomes were recently presented and submitted for publication, demonstrating that 16% of patients initially choosing active surveillance cross over to intervention\u2014usually partial nephrectomy. Therefore over 80% were spared surgery. There was no difference in cancer-specific survival between active surveillance and primary intervention. Bladder Cancer We are the first urology team in Boston to regularly perform radical cystectomy and urinary diversion entirely robotically. Through our membership in the IRCC (International Radical Cystectomy Consortium), we have published on a variety of issues, including the rates of cancer recurrence after robotic cystectomy and the impact of perioperative chemotherapy on survival after robotic cystectomy. We also have recent funding and IRB approval for a randomized trial at BIDMC to evaluate the use of home IV fluids after cystectomy. Bladder cancer patients have a high readmission rate due to dehydration and this study will evaluate the utility of this type of preventive treatment. Prostate Cancer We continue to investigate a novel method of identifying positive margins in real time during robotic prostatectomy using a non-linear microscope (NLM) and have begun a pilot study evaluating prostatectomy specimens immediately after surgery using NLM. Information gained through this IRB-approved pilot study will be used to design a randomized trial to evaluate the ability of NLM to improve our rate of nerve-sparing and reduce final positive margins. We are one of the area's leaders in the field of prostate cancer active surveillance. Our group is the only member of the Canary Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Study (Canary-PASS) in the Northeast. This is the largest prospective multi-center study of active surveillance for prostate cancer, with more than 2,000 patients enrolled. This project was recently awarded an NIH UO1 grant to support research infrastructure for the next five years. As part of our ongoing interest in quality of life after prostatectomy, we evaluated the importance of preoperative pelvic floor physical therapy in our robotic radical prostatectomy database. We found that pelvic sphincter endurance measured preoperatively was predictive of early recovery of continence.

Chaikof, MD, PhD Johnson and Johnson Professor of Surgery Chair, Department of Surgery Surgeon-in-Chief RESEARCH FOCUS Our laboratory (chaikoflab.org) is focused on the discovery of new drugs and the development of tissue-engineered organs based upon the principles of chemistry, biomolecular engineering, and 3-D fabrication technologies. Ongoing research is directed at the following areas. Drug Discovery Identification of new drugs to inhibit inflammation and thrombosis We are currently synthesizing compounds to block inflammatory responses that contribute to deep venous thrombosis, atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer metastasis. A number of these drugs are designed to inhibit selectins, which play an important role in the recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed tissue, as well as nuclear receptors that modulate the immune response. Biomaterials Science Design of anti-thrombogenic surfaces The development of artificial organs remains limited by the propensity of all synthetic surfaces to induce thrombus formation despite systemic anticoagulation. Current studies are designing surfaces that present molecules, including novel synthetic heparins, that resist clotting and whose bioactive surfaces can be \"regenerated\" in situ to extend and improve the clinical performance of blood-contacting devices, such as vascular grafts, heart valves, left ventricular devices, and implantable artificial lungs and kidneys. Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Engineering blood vessels Synthetic blood vessel substitutes for cardiac or vascular surgery do not exist. Ongoing efforts in our group seek to develop bioprinting approaches, which along with new synthetic collagen and elastin analogues can be assembled with vascular wall cells derived from stem cells to engineer a living artery. We use genome editing to generate \"hypoimmunogenic\" stem cells that evade the human immune system. Vascular Biology Targeted therapies to promote vascular wall healing Restenosis remains a major cause of failure after angioplasty and stenting for treatment of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. New approaches are being developed that target thrombotic and inflammatory events at the site of vessel wall injury without disrupting hemostatic mechanisms or increasing the risk of bleeding. Genome Editing Design of delivery systems for in vivo genome editing Genome editing raises the transformative possibility of curing genetic diseases and installing protective alleles. But major challenges limit the clinical translation of this technology, foremost of which is the difficulty of delivering editing agents to somatic cells in vivo . We are developing new delivery technologies to enable selective editing of target cells with high efficiency and DNA specificity. ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 Ongoing collaborations with David Liu, PhD (Broad Institute/Harvard University) have led to a new program directed at the design of delivery systems for in vivo genome editing as part of the NIH Somatic Cell Genome Editing Consortium (SCGE) .

We are a member of an NHLBI Consortium Linking Oncology with Thrombosis (CLOT) to determine the underlying biological mechanisms that increase the risk of venous thromboembolism among patients with cancer, in collaboration with Jeffrey Zwicker, MD, PhD, and Robert Flaumenhaft, MD (Hematology, BIDMC). Likewise, we have an ongoing NIH-funded research program to design a new generation of protein drugs that inhibit thrombosis without impairing hemostasis in an ongoing collaboration with Karlheinz Peter, MD, PhD (University of Melbourne, Australia) along with a new collaboration with Karl E. Griswold, PhD, and Chris Bailey-Kellogg, PhD (Computer Science and Engineering, Dartmouth). We were awarded a $1M Blavatnik Therapeutics Challenge Award from Harvard Medical School to develop selectin inhibitors for prevention of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism.

Ferran, MD, PhD Lewis Thomas Professor of Surgery RESEARCH GROUP Cleide Angolano, PhD Mauricio Contreras, MD Lauren Shah, PhD Maryam Shamloo, PhD Jacqueline Wade, MDRESEARCH FOCUS My laboratory focuses on: Defining the molecular signature of what \"return to homeostasis\" entails in the face of injury, whether inflammatory, immune, infectious, metabolic, or mechanical, i.e. the \"molecular basis of health\" Identifying the culprits that hinder \"return to homeostasis\" and thus result in pathology Validating signature molecules in animal models of human disease for clinical translation as diagnostic, prognostic, and most importantly, therapeutic tools This line of research was triggered by our seminal discovery that up-regulation of the ubiquitin-modulatory protein A20, AKA, TNFAIP3 or Bcl members, A1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in endothelial cells in response to inflammatory stimuli, serves a general \"protective\" function by shutting down inflammation through inhibition of the transcription factor NF- (JBC 1996;271:18068). Subsequent studies confirmed A20 as one of humans' most potent and ubiquitous physiologic anti-inflammatory molecules. A20 not only goes to the NF- heart of inflammation, but also beyond to control Interferon and / signaling, and modulate cell survival and proliferation, with return to homeostasis as the ultimate goal. We established the therapeutic benefits of A20-based therapies in a number of disease models that share inflammation as a central pathogenic component, focusing on the three fields below. Vascular Diseases Our data qualifies A20 as a potent \"atheroprotective\" and \"modulator of angiogenesis\" molecule, evidenced in animal of: neointimal hyperplasia post-balloon angioplasty transplant arteriosclerosis, the pathognomonic feature of chronic allograft rejection accelerated atherosclerosis of diabetes vein graft and prosthetic arterial graft failure proliferative retinopathies, and blinding eye diseases Liver Regeneration and Repair We have extensively documented a potent \"hepatoprotective\" role for A20 in the liver, stemming from combined anti- inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and pro-proliferative functions of A20 in hepatocytes. Accordingly, A20-based therapies protect mice from lethality in models of acute toxic hepatitis, lethal radical hepatectomy where 90% of the liver is resected, prolonged warm liver ischemia, and orthotopic liver transplantation using marginal grafts. We uncovered an unsuspected phenotype in A20 heterozygous mice, whereby a benign 2/3 hepatectomy caused a staggering 50% lethality. These data imply that single nucleotide polymorphisms that negatively impact A20 expression and/or function could inform the risk of extensive liver resections for donation or tumor. We lately discovered that A20 regulates lipid metabolism in a way that improves fatty liver disease in a mouse model of human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Current pre-translational studies in pigs using clinically safe gene therapy platforms to induce A20 expression in the liver are promising and prelude clinical implementation in transplantation and xenotransplantation. Treatment of Diabetes Islet transplantation: A20 retained its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory functions in -cells, thus was an ideal candidate to genetically engineer islet grafts for the treatment of diabetes. Insulin alternatives: We discovered a novel anti-diabetic function of A20, whereby a single injection of a hepatotropic A20 gene therapy vector restored glycemic control in a mouse model of type I diabetes. Remarkably, this effect was long-lasting and insulin independent. We are exploring clinical translation of this finding into a first-in-class anti- diabetic modality.

LoGerfo, MD William McDermott Distinguished Professor of Surgery Leena Pradhan-Nabzdyk, PhD, MBA Assistant Professor of Surgery RESEARCH GROUP Mauricio Contreras, MD Jennifer Li, MD Navneet Momi, PhD Kimberly Piper, MS, MARESEARCH FOCUS Our group has been extensively involved in different areas of vascular biology, diabetes, and neuropeptide research: 1) evaluating mechanisms responsible for the development of intimal hyperplasia (IH) in vein grafts and prosthetic grafts; and 2) developing novel techniques to prevent IH in both vein grafts and prosthetic grafts using bioengineering methodologies. IH is the most common cause of delayed prosthetic arterial graft failure and delayed failure of vein grafts. As graft healing occurs, genes are either up- or down-regulated as compared to a quiescent arterial wall. Our lab studies altered gene expression that results in endothelial cell activation as well as cellular proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix production by smooth muscle cells, leading to vein graft IH and anastomotic IH (AIH). ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 Based on our previous work, the LoGerfo-Pradhan group has identified gene targets that are altered in both vein graft IH and AIH. Current work is focused on understanding the biology of these molecules, including Thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2) and interleukin (IL)-18, and developing techniques to deliver silencing RNA (siRNA) to the vessel wall to silence those targets and thereby mitigate the development of IH. Results from these projects have been presented at several national and international meetings and have led to manuscripts. In collaboration with Drs. Christiane Ferran and Manoj Bhasin of BIDMC, we conducted single cell genomics in a canine model of vein graft IH. This work, which is currently ongoing, will be first such single cell genomics study in the field. Based on these preliminary results, our group successfully renewed its R01 funding for this project. Additionally, the metabolomics results have backed these genomic alterations and efforts made to increase the overall sample size. During the pandemic, a meta-analysis study was conducted on vein graft failure research aiming to discover signature genome targets for IH prevention. The results have been presented at various international and national meetings by postdoctoral fellow Navneet Momi. The prosthetic IH project, being conducted in collaboration with Drs. Christiane Ferran of BIDMC and Dr. David Mooney (Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences), is focused on developing Click-Hydrogels that can be coated on clinically used prosthetic grafts as dacron to deliver siRNA at the anastomotic site in an in vivo rat carotid angioplasty model. The group is also working on designing a double- sided tape to secure the gel for improved siRNA delivery and optimizing its flexibility and impermeable backing in vitro . The results from this project have been presented at national and international meetings by postdoctoral fellows Cindy Hyunh, Patric Liang, and Jennifer Li. Additionally, human aortic thrombus specimens have been collected and biobanked for ongoing aortic aneurysm thrombus evaluation for inflammatory markers and microbiome analysis. Through NIH R21 funding, Dr. Pradhan-Nabzdyk, in close collaboration with Dr. Lijun Sun of BIDMC, has discovered several small molecule inhibitors of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-18. IL-18 is implicated in many chronic conditions including ulcerative colitis, cardiovascular disease, psoriasis, and various cancers. In addition to testing the efficacy 139 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.of these inhibitors in vascular disease models, Drs. Pradhan-Nabzdyk and Sun are collaborating with colleagues in the BIDMC divisions of gastroenterology and colon and rectal surgery to test the efficacy in patient samples of ulcerative colitis. The data from these experiments are extremely promising and have gained special interest from industrial companies regarding inhibitor IC50s. A provisional patent application has been filed for these molecules. TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION We have mentored several students and postdocs in the lab. Additionally, Drs. LoGerfo, Pradhan-Nabzdyk, and Ferran are the Co-program Directors of the NIH T-32 Harvard-Longwood Research Training Program in Vascular Surgery. This two- or three-year research training program is the oldest such program in vascular surgery in the country. Currently there are eight trainees (seven surgical residents and one PhD postdoctoral fellow) mentored in different labs in the Longwood Medical Area. Trainees from around the country apply to this program and, thus far, 87 trainees have graduated from the program. This grant was successfully renewed for years 26-30. In addition, Drs. LoGerfo and Pradhan- Nabzdyk co-direct the NIH T-35 program, the Harvard-Longwood Short-Term Research Training Program in Vascular Surgery. Now in its eighth year, this 10- to 12-week summer program trains medical students in vascular surgery research. Medical students from across the country apply to this program and conduct research in various labs in the Longwood Medical Area. To date, 50 students have graduated from this program.

Zettervall, MDRESEARCH FOCUS My clinical research group has an active interest in vascular surgery outcomes research on a local and national level. As emerging technologies evolve the way we practice medicine, comparative effectiveness research has been instrumental in the identification of best practices from among an increasingly complex set of therapeutic options. Our main interest is to compare outcomes after open surgery and endovascular surgery for a variety of vascular diseases, including aortic aneurysms, carotid disease, and lower extremity arterial disease, in order to help guide patient selection for each type of procedure. We utilize a wide range of observational, registry, and administrative data from real-world settings to better understand the impact of vascular treatments on disease processes. Our experience at BIDMC, boasting the world's largest series of distal bypass and tibial angioplasty procedures, provided rich data from which we have published on the effectiveness of primary endovascular therapy for critical limb-threatening ischemia and the benefits of statin dose intensities. We have used our institutional experience with novel imaging systems to show reduced radiation exposure and contrast dose for patients and providers. Joining other institutions in the region and nationally, we are an active participant in the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) and the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI). These large databases provide detailed procedural and patient-related information from which we have investigated regional differences in patient selection, treatment, and outcomes of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), carotid artery stenosis, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD), among other vascular diseases. We have developed and published work on risk-prediction models that can be used in real-world settings to guide physicians in counseling a patient on his/her individual risk of surgery. Through the VQI as well as other databases such as the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP), we shed light on disparities in presentation, treatment selection, and outcomes across genders and racial groups. In addition, administrative data such as the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a 20% sampling of all inpatient admissions, and the State Ambulatory Surgery Databases (SASD), a database of all ambulatory surgical encounters by state, have been invaluable in addressing population-based clinical questions, including the epidemiologic trends in the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic mesenteric ischemia. Importantly, we have partnered with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) to obtain Medicare data for the study of open versus endovascular AAA management, including a comparison of different endovascular stent grafts for AAA repair. We have also demonstrated that late rupture after endovascular repair is a subsisting concern that merits further research. Finally, we have also combined data from several of these sources to comment on data quality, as in our review of the accuracy of administrative data versus clinical data for assignment of neurologic symptom status in patients undergoing carotid revascularization. We also compared the accuracy of administrative versus quality improvement data for AAA demographics and outcomes. Expertise in the use of these datasets against the backdrop of our busy clinical practice has allowed our group to produce tangible improvements in the management of vascular disease by translating clinical issues into tangible research questions.141 2020 Surgery Research ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 15.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2019-2020 With more than 34 peer-reviewed publications and more than 40 presentations* at national and regional society meetings and international symposia in the last two years, my research group has continued to make significant contributions to vascular surgery in the area of comparative-effectiveness research. This rich clinical activity has facilitated our participation in multi-center clinical trials in the areas of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, best treatment for critical limb-threatening ischemia, and management of carotid artery atherosclerotic disease. Such activity has kept our Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery at the cutting edge of new advances in endovascular surgery and positioned us well to report on the effectiveness of these techniques in the literature. Beyond our institution, I have taken on leadership positions in the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) and the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI), innovative quality- improvement initiatives at the regional and national level, respectively. The VSGNE, a consortium of over 30 regional hospitals, collects granular clinical data across institutions from which participants have published novel insights on the management of vascular diseases. The success of the VSGNE has provided a model for quality-improvement efforts nationally through the formation of the VQI, a cooperative of 18 regional quality groups in the U.S. and Canada, and endorsed by the Society for Vascular Surgery. As a member of the Executive and Research Advisory Committees for both organizations, I have worked with our research group to develop projects utilizing these data, resulting in many peer-reviewed publications. * Society for Vascular Surgery, Vascular Annual Meeting (10 presentations in 2019; 5 presentations in 2020).

TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION Under my mentorship, our research group has welcomed a number of tremendously productive candidates in vascular surgery over the past years. Research fellows have come from our own general surgery residency as well as prestigious residency programs around the country. PhD candidates have come through an exciting international research exchange relationship with the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, now in its ninth year of existence. In addition, we have developed research collaborations with Toronto, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, and Milan. All research fellows receive formal instruction in research methods and statistics through the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and have gone on to present our work at national meetings in vascular surgery.SELECTED RESEARCH SUPPORT Carotid Revascularization Multicenter, Controlled Trial to Compare Best Endovascular Versus Best Surgical Therapy in Patients with Critical Limb Ischemia (BEST-CLI).
