Dr. Horner lives in Northern Kentucky \u2014 about 10 minutes from downtown Cincinnati, Ohio \u2014 and has a deep and abiding interest in alternative approaches to health, especially Maharishi Ayurveda. Q: Welcome to our special series on [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas), Dr. Horner. Would you start by telling our readers something about your background and the work you do? Dr. Horner: I'm a board certified plastic surgeon and worked in private practice in the Greater Cincinnati area since 1991. About 80% of my practice involved surgeries of the breast \u2014 breast reductions, augmentations and reconstructions for breast cancer. In 1999, I began hosting a television news segment teaching people about Maharishi Ayurveda as well as other research-proven forms of complementary and alternative medicine and natural approaches to healing. This segment aired on the local ABC and NBC affiliates from 1999 until the spring of 2002. The Wisdom Television Network picked up the segment last year. This spring I decided to sell my plastic surgery practice to focus on writing books, lecturing and doing longer-format programming (half-hour) for the Wisdom Television Network. The first series of television programs we plan to do for Wisdom will focus on complementary and alternative approaches to the prevention, treatment and recovery from cancer. Q: That is interesting. When did you first hear about ayurveda or Maharishi Ayurveda? Dr. Horner: In 1996. I was working on some legislation to make it mandatory that insurance companies pay for breast reconstruction after mastectomies. In that context I flew to Washington to meet with President Clinton, to talk to him about this legislation on a federal level, and when I got back the local television news crew came out and did an interview with me. The reporter doing the story was Paul Schaefer, who is now my fianc\u00e9. Paul has been a teacher of the [Transcendental Meditation](http://www.tm.org/)\u00ae technique for 30 years. I was very interested in complementary and alternative medicine even prior to meeting him, and I was actually thinking about ways to incorporate some of those techniques and modalities into my practice. Eventually, I planned to create an alternative medicine center and fully integrate my plastic surgery practice. Also, my mother had died of breast cancer in 1994, and I was really concerned for myself because I knew having a mother with breast cancer made my risk substantially higher. So I was looking into alternative medicine to see if there was anything that could help prevent breast cancer, or at least significantly reduce my chances of getting it. The thought of doing nothing more than just getting yearly mammograms and doing self-breast exams and waiting for it to finally happen felt like I was living my life in a terrifying game of Russian roulette \u2014 not something that had a lot of appeal for me. Paul told me when we met that I should really learn how to meditate, and I agreed. So a couple of months after I met him I learned [Transcendental Meditation](http://www.tm.org/)\u00ae. I was absolutely blown away by the effects I felt with it. Then Paul suggested I try [panchakarma](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/panchakarma-for-vitality), the ayurvedic rejuvenation program. I went through the panchakarma program, and that was it for me. Within 48 hours of starting panchakarma I looked 10 years younger, and I had never felt better in my life. That was when I first thought, \"There is really something to this.\" So I just really plunged into it. When I was at [The Raj](http://www.theraj.com/) in Fairfield, Iowa, going through panchakarma, I watched every educational videotape they had. And I've since done the doctors' training course in Maharishi Ayurveda. I've read virtually everything I could get my hands on about this approach to healing. I realized then that people everywhere really need to know about this remarkable science, because too many people are sick and they just don't know what to do to be healthy. For example, there are ways to reduce your risk of getting cancer by 70, 80, 90 and maybe even 100% with some simple lifestyle choices and dietary choices and doing panchakarma regularly. That's when Paul and I decided to create a television show \u2014 a two-minute segment in the local newscast \u2014 to teach people this information. And we really got a tremendous response to it. The time was right for it. People were really hungry for this type of information. Gradually, the more I got into doing the programs on ayurveda and reading about natural approaches to healing, the less I was interested in my conventional practice. And finally the scales tipped this past spring, and I decided to sell my practice. I feel I can make a bigger difference for the world by getting out this programming, which could even be aired internationally and really impact the health of the planet. Q: That sounds wonderful. And you seem to have found the correct way to interpret the traditional knowledge. It's astonishing how you take the knowledge and make it so simple, so easy to understand and apply. No jargon. No highly esoteric language. You present the facts in a straightforward, credible way for people. Dr. Horner: Thank you. Q: When you were actively practicing, were you successful at integrating the two approaches? Dr. Horner: I tried, but with not much success in my specific field. It was actually quite shocking to me. As a plastic surgeon, I would have people that would come in to see me, for example, complaining about chronic pain in their breasts or shooting pains. The reason they were referred to me was because they had exhausted everything in Western medicine and finally they had been sent to a surgeon, who had recommended that they undergo mastectomies to eliminate their pain. They came to me for reconstructions. I said \"No, no, no.\" I tried to tell them that the pains indicated an underlying imbalance, and there were some very simple things such as lifestyle changes that could make a significant difference and quite possibly eliminate the pain without surgery. And, routinely, they weren't interested. I was shocked. Most of them felt they didn't come to see me for advice; they came for surgery \u2014 that was a standard response that patients would give to me whenever I would bring up ayurveda. Only very rarely would I have somebody that would be open to it. I think this was because of the type of practice I had \u2014 that that's just the mentality people had when they came to me. They were ready for surgery and they weren't open to alternative options or in taking responsibility for their health. I had one lady come to see me who had cystic acne. She had even taken Accutane \u2014 a very potent acne drug \u2014 and hadn't had any improvement in her condition. Just looking at her you could tell that she had severe physiological imbalances in Kapha and Pitta, so I said to her, \"You've exhausted all the things that you can do with Western medicine. Why don't you try making these dietary changes to see if they help?\" Her response was, \"I don't believe in alternative approaches; I just came here for you to cut out the cysts.\" Incidents like this finally made me realize that I could not do this anymore. The one area where I did integrate Maharishi Ayurveda very well was when women with breast cancer came to see me. When people get cancer they suddenly are open to different healing approaches. So I always sat down with those patients and went through everything that I knew about ayurveda \u2014 I talked to them about taking [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas) while they were undergoing their chemo treatments and afterwards. And I'd talk to them about other things like an organic vegetarian diet, exercising, eliminating sugar, and eating flax seeds. I always recommended learning to meditate. They were always open \u2014 they listened. Those are the main types of patients that I was able to have some success with. Q: What are the things about ayurveda that excite you? It is a more gentle form of healing, but one that can stay with you life-long in terms of generating good health. The physicians we speak with give us diverse reasons for their interest in this approach to wellness. Dr. Horner: There are many things about ayurveda that excite me. Ayurveda has really been the answer to my prayers. To sum it up, I'd say that the most exciting things to me are its ability to effectively prevent disease, slow aging, and create a profound state of health beyond what most people would think is possible \u2014 really, it's the possibility for enlightenment through profound health and balance. I sure didn't learn that in medical school \u2014 even though I think that at the heart of it, most people go to medical school because they dream of being able to help people in this way but aren't able to articulate it as such. From a personal side, this is why ayurveda answered my prayers: I've always been health conscious. I've run and worked out ever since I was in high school and I've been a vegetarian since I was 14. But I didn't feel good. I would experience energy crashes in the afternoon and I just didn't feel that good. I thought, \"Here I am, 38 years old, and I don't feel that well, even though I'm doing everything that I know I'm supposed to be doing \u2014 and it's just downhill from here.\" And I also had great concerns about getting breast cancer, as I mentioned before. Then I did panchakarma in 1996 for the first time, and it was fabulous: I don't think I've ever felt better in my life. Ever since then I've done panchakarma twice a year, every year, religiously. When I was going through panchakarma the first time, I also learned simple things to help me feel better \u2014 quit drinking coffee, eat my main meal at noon and practice daily meditation and yoga and so on...now I feel great all the time and I'll be very surprised if I develop a chronic illness or cancer. As another side benefit, I also have no sense of any significant aging occurring in my body. And I look younger than I did 10 years ago. Having access to these technologies is something that's totally transformed my relationship with aging \u2014 it's like it doesn't exist. As a plastic surgeon, a large part of my job was to help people try to slow or reverse aging, but it was done artificially \u2014 with chemicals and surgery. It wasn't true reversal of the aging process; it didn't slow aging \u2014 it just camouflaged it. I was really excited to find something that really could truly slow and reverse aging and enhance beauty \u2014 something one could never get from a knife. Ayurveda is also very empowering. Western medicine so often says that we don't know why someone developed the disease an individual has, and we have no idea how to prevent most diseases. It's a pretty helpless way to live. But ayurveda clearly and simply explains the origin of virtually all diseases, and gives you recommendations and surprisingly simple and effective techniques to stay healthy \u2014 and not only do you get to prevent disease by following those recommendations and practicing those techniques, but you also can achieve a profound state of health and consciousness beyond what most people would think possible. It's shocking to me the way we were trained in Western medicine. In medical school, for example, I didn't have a single course on nutrition. When you look at the conventional medical literature, the conclusion of many studies looking at the relationship of diet and cancer is that 70-80% of all cancers, for instance, could be prevented through diet and exercise alone. But then you're not taught any of that in medical school; you're taught only disease treatment. Western medicine has gone down a pharmaceutical disease-treatment tunnel and has blinders on. Some day we are going to wake up and see how shortsighted that approach is. In the Western approach, the individual does not take any responsibility for what he or she does daily, and people are suddenly shocked and horrified when they get sick. Then they think there's some silver bullet out there that's somehow going to make them well. The incredible thing about ayurveda is its understanding of the origin of disease and the promotion of health \u2014 that everything you do affects you. Every thought you think, every aroma you smell, every sound you hear, every food you eat, absolutely everything takes you into balance or out of balance \u2014 just knowing what to do is the key, and ayurveda tells us these things. Therefore you have a great deal of control over the level of your health and well-being, and none of us is really a \"victim.\" Q: So it's a more positive approach, compared to just worrying about what could happen and not taking any measures to really live life? Dr. Horner: Absolutely. Most people are just surviving life. And they're just surviving their bodies, and ayurveda is a system of medicine or a system of health that allows you to get the full monte out of life. Q: You told us you couldn't incorporate ayurveda extensively into your conventional practice because of the nature of your practice, but if a physician wanted to have an integrative approach to medicine in a field where it was possible, do you see any conflict, or do you think that the two systems can co-exist and serve their individual purposes? Dr. Horner: They absolutely can co-exist. I once read a quote that went something like this: \"There is no such thing as alternative medicine. Only techniques that work and techniques that don't.\" There's been a significant increase in the amount of research on \"alternative\" techniques that proves that many of them are safe and effective, especially in Maharishi Ayurveda. For instance, 500-600 articles have been published on [TM](http://www.tm.org/), and so have many studies on [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas) and panchakarma. Most people think there's very little research on alternative therapies or herbs, but there's actually been quite a bit. For instance, did you know there are about 1,300 studies published on the spice [turmeric](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/5-benefits-of-turmeric-ayurveda-s-golden-botanical)? The medical community and the public are beginning to realize the value of health approaches other than pharmaceuticals and surgery. There will always be a place for drugs and surgery \u2014 if I were in a serious car accident I'd want to go to the hospital. But when it comes to preventing disease and gently bringing balance and health back, alternative techniques like ayurveda work better than any Western approach. I really think that is where medicine is going, and the consumer is driving it. If you look at the statistics, the number of individuals who are using alternative therapies, and the amount of money that people are spending on alternative therapies, are rising exponentially. So the demand is out there. I think people are tired of not feeling good and feeling like they have no control over their health. And then if they do get sick, they are subjected to often extremely harsh treatments with lots and lots of side effects. Sometimes the treatment is worse than the disease. I think people are looking for a gentler way, and I think their doctors are having to respond to that request. Ideally, our health care system would be a complete integration of Western medicine and ayurveda. For example, if somebody were diagnosed with cancer, conventional testing would be required, perhaps surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, but in addition to that, ayurvedic techniques and attention to proper diet and digestion would be prescribed to help correct the underlying imbalances that most likely contributed to their disease. While undergoing conventional treatments for cancer, the patient would also be instructed to use ayurvedic techniques and herbal preparations like [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas) to help support the immune system and decrease the side effects of chemotherapy. When the patients complete conventional treatment, then panchakarma would be prescribed to help detoxify their bodies and quickly and powerfully rebuild their immune system and induce balance. Q: How would you introduce someone who is absolutely new to ayurveda to it? And let's talk about the approaches you would take if you were speaking with a patient, with another doctor, or the general public, because you present it currently to all three audiences. Dr. Horner: Yes, I've done all three. That's a pretty big question; I don't know if I can answer it very concisely. When I introduce the general public to it, it's about an hour-and-a-half lecture. So I'll give you just a few starting points I use. I tell people that there is a 5,000-year-old system of healing that originated in the Vedic culture \u2014 what is now India \u2014 and it's called ayurveda. \"Ayur\" means life and \"veda\" means knowledge, so ayurveda literally means the knowledge of life. It tells you how to live life so that you can be healthy, which you can see is very different from Western medicine. I tell people that it's a system of medicine that looks at the laws of nature. What I mean by that is, for example, that you know you have to sleep at night, you know you have to eat, you know you have to drink water or else you don't do very well. These are some fundamental laws of being a human being that you have to abide by in order to stay alive and to maintain health. Ayurveda is a system of medicine where not only are these basic laws recognized but also hundreds and hundreds of other fundamental laws of nature that help to powerfully refine your level of health \u2014 very simple things like eating your main meal at noontime, going to bed by 10:00 p.m. and getting up at 6:00 a.m. \u2014 ayurveda teaches that things like these can have a profound balancing effect on your health. Then I usually go into the five phases of disease, and how keeping the physiology in balance is the best thing you can do to prevent disease from ever taking hold. Everything you do affects you one way or another, and so you really need to think about everything that you do and take responsibility for your well-being instead of ignoring it. I generally conclude by acknowledging that the information can be overwhelming. That they will never achieve health through doing just one thing, but they should start with one thing and then keep adding one thing at a time. One of the best places to start is learning [Transcendental Meditation](http://www.tm.org/)\u00ae. I always recommend the [panchakarma](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/panchakarma-for-vitality) rejuvenation therapy. I think it's a great jump-start and at [The Raj](http://www.theraj.com/) in Fairfield, Iowa, people get a very good practical introduction to ayurveda as well through the educational lectures, tapes and, of course, through their own personal experience \u2014 which generally isn't subtle. I also think it's great for them to experience a community of people all doing the same thing so that it doesn't seem so \"out there, weird or un-doable.\" They get to meet a lot of other \"normal\" people who are using ayurveda and still going to work every day. I also always recommend [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas) . Q: And you tell them about your personal experience with ayurveda? Dr. Horner: Oh yes, of course. Q: You did talk a little bit about this earlier, but maybe you can tell our readers a little more about your experience that people are being more open to alternative healing approaches in general and ayurveda in particular \u2014 more than they would have been a few years ago. Dr. Horner: Yes. It's really quite amazing. I think people are far more open to alternative medicine and ayurveda now than they ever were before. The whole concept of complementary and alternative medicine in all its forms is far more acceptable in our culture than it was before. There's the famous Eisenburg study that shows the number of people using alternative therapies is rising quickly, and now almost 50% of Americans use some form of alternative treatments every year. People are realizing the value of these techniques through their own personal experience, and there is now an increasing body of research proving these techniques do work. Also, people are getting more and more disillusioned with Western pharmaceutical approaches and are looking for something different. The biggest personal measurement of just how open people are to alternative treatments and ayurveda came from the feedback from doing our television news segment. It was sometimes unbelievable. We did a story, for instance, on the health benefits of the ayurvedic herb holy basil. We specifically talked about its ability to reduce anxiety and depression and lower blood sugar levels in diabetics. The weekend we aired that segment, the entire national supply of holy basil sold out in Cincinnati. We also did several segments on [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas), and Maharishi Ayurveda Products has told us that Cincinnati now sells more [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas) than almost any city in the country. Q: Amazing. Dr. Horner: That's just an example of the huge response we got to well-done, research-based informative programs on alternative healing approaches. While the response has been better thus far to things that look a little similar to Western medicine \u2014 for example, taking herbs instead of pills \u2014 individuals are venturing out more and more. I've had quite a few people that have gone to [The Raj](http://www.theraj.com/) in Fairfield, Iowa for panchakarma, and I have had no problem persuading people to take [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas). There's a lot more openness to it now. Definitely. Q: When did you first hear about [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas)? Dr. Horner: In 1996. Q: Do you take it now? Dr. Horner: Yes, I've been taking it ever since then. Q: And what are the benefits that you see in yourself from taking it regularly? Do you take the combination? Dr. Horner: Yes, I take both parts of the formula. It's hard to specify benefits at this point because I've been taking it for so many years. Also, when I started taking it, I changed all sorts of things about my diet and routine all at once. So it's hard for me to say what I can relate directly to taking [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas). I started to meditate, practice yoga, eat my main meal at noon, cut coffee out and a lot of other things \u2014 all that at the same time I started on Amrit. The main thing for me is that I know that I'm getting a lot of protection from chronic disorders like cancer, as well as aging. Q: What about energy level? Does [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas) make a difference in that? Dr. Horner: I've taken it religiously for 6 years now, 7 years almost. And, as I said, I'm not one of these gradual people \u2014 I changed many things at one time. So I can't tell you if what I experienced was due specifically to [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/products/herbal-supplements/immunity-antioxidants/amrit-kalash-products.html) or to the combination of everything else I was doing. I know I felt a million times better as a result of all the changes I made, taken together. I could tell a difference in the appearance of my skin. I looked younger and felt better and my energy levels were better; but again, I learned to meditate, went through panchakarma, started doing yoga and changed my diet all at the same time. Q: How would you present [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/products/herbal-supplements/immunity-antioxidants/amrit-kalash-products.html) to someone who hasn't heard about it before? What would you tell them about it? Dr. Horner: It would depend on what I was seeing them for. For instance, if I was seeing a breast cancer patient, the first thing I would talk to them about would be taking [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas) to help reduce the unpleasant side effects of chemotherapy, improve their quality of life, help prevent recurrences and to support their immune system. I tell them about the research done on Amrit in India on breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy that shows that Amrit did not interfere with the effectiveness of the chemotherapy \u2014 in fact, it may even help a little bit. If I'm talking to people who are generally healthy \u2014 for example, I got my brother to start taking Amrit \u2014 I talk to them about all the research that's been done on it to show that it's the most potent antioxidant that we know of and that it's got properties to help support your immune system and your liver function; it slows aging; inactivates toxins and helps to prevent cancer. The main groups of patients I would talk to about Amrit would either be cancer patients or people who are interested in promoting their health \u2014 I think [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/products/herbal-supplements/immunity-antioxidants/amrit-kalash-products.html) is the best generalized antioxidant and health-promoting herbal preparation anyone can take. Q: What is the feedback that you've received from people whom you've recommended Amrit to? Dr. Horner: The first experience I had with giving [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas) to a patient was with a cancer patient \u2014 she was 35 years old when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was emotionally very difficult for me to see her in that state, because I knew her before she had cancer. She was a very pretty, vivacious woman who looked very young for her age. It was horrifying to me that someone like her could have breast cancer. She had five primary tumors \u2014 or separate cancers \u2014 in one breast, which I've never ever seen before. I just started downloading to her everything that I knew that she could do to help with her chances. At the time, and this was years ago, I told her that she should start taking Amrit and it wasn't because I knew then specifically that it would help with the side effects of chemotherapy. I didn't know that then. But I knew from Dr. Hari Sharma's research that it could help shrink tumors and prevent tumors from even starting. So I told her to start taking Amrit. She had done one course of chemotherapy and had been so sick with it she told me she thought she was going to die. She said she was lying on the bathroom floor for 24 hours and couldn't even get up. She couldn't eat for days. She didn't go to work for a whole week. And she contemplated not doing it again, but she had two little boys and she knew she had to go ahead and go through chemo for them. At that time her Amrit arrived, so she started taking the Amrit. Then she had her next dose of chemotherapy. She said she was coming home from the hospital after having it and she felt completely fine. She was waiting for the sickness to hit her. She came home and she cooked dinner and she kept waiting for it to hit. She went to bed and woke up the next day and she was still feeling okay. She went to work as usual that day and never felt bad. She never had another symptom from her chemotherapy \u2014 ever, and she thought Amrit was just an absolute lifesaver. She said she actually felt better doing chemotherapy on Amrit than she had felt before she got sick. I would usually see my breast reconstruction patients for follow up in the office about every 6 weeks after surgery for at least 6 months. So I would see them several times during their course of chemotherapy. Normally when people are in chemotherapy, they look horrible. I saw this lady right after she had received her second dose of chemotherapy. I opened the door and my jaw just dropped, because not only did she not look sick \u2014 most people are gray and look awful \u2014 but she looked radiant. She said her blood count has never dropped. Her energy levels were better than they had ever been. She had maintained her weight. Her doctors were shocked. She said that she would kill anyone who took her Amrit away from her. Q: That is amazing. Dr. Horner: Yes. There's another patient with an equally amazing story \u2014 she's the wife of a professional hockey player. We were interviewing him for our show, and he told us that his wife had just been diagnosed with breast cancer. Of course, we told him about [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas). She started taking it and she had the same response to it. She was so sick from the chemotherapy that she thought she was going to die. She couldn't sleep. She sat there shaking after her treatment. And as soon as she started taking the Amrit, zero symptoms, energy level was fine, and she felt great. She went on the radio and did a couple of segments on TV with us to tell people about her experience with Amrit. She wanted everyone to know. So the feedback that I've gotten from my patients is that literally Amrit has been the difference between life and death for them. Amrit was the only thing that allowed them to make it through chemotherapy. It changed their experience of chemo from an absolutely horrible experience to something that wasn't that bad. It's basically saved their lives, and they've said those exact words to me many times about Amrit. Q: That's wonderful. What is it about the formulation or about its antioxidant properties that makes [Amrit](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas) so beneficial for a broad spectrum of people? Dr. Horner: I can't say for sure. I think that we can analyze products with the limited tests that we have, and we can come to some conclusions \u2014 for instance, that Amrit has substantial antioxidant properties to it. But that understanding is probably too simplistic. There are probably things going on with the herbs and their interaction with one another, and the intelligence of the herbs interacting with the intelligence of our bodies, that we have no ability to test. There is something beyond antioxidant protection that happens between Amrit and our bodies. Personally I think that the intelligence in these herbs gets imported into the body to help rebalance it and help it operate at a much higher level. Amrit enhances the intelligence of the body. Q: Tell us a little more about this concept of herbs having intelligence \u2014 how would you explain that to someone? Dr. Horner: Very simply put, everything in the universe is composed of the same basic elements and universal intelligence, and we have certain patterns of that universal intelligence within our bodies. Each of the plants or herbs in Amrit is a small package of expression of that intelligence. When our body becomes imbalanced in some way, there is some lack of intelligence in our body. We lose some of our innate intelligence. And the intelligence expressed in the plants and herbs is something that we can bring into our bodies to reestablish that pattern of intelligence that we are lacking. The herbs create the full expression of intelligence in our body once more. Q: You spoke about a couple of cases earlier where you recommended Amrit to cancer patents. Do you have any cases you can tell us about where you recommended it for well-being for other types of patients? Dr. Horner: I recommended Amrit to an individual who had been diagnosed with Hepatitis C, along with milk thistle, which has been shown to reduce liver enzymes. I also told him to stop drinking alcohol. His liver enzymes went way down after he started following these suggestions. He was on Interferon, but stayed on Amrit while he was on Interferon. His enzyme counts are now normal and all his titers for the Hepatitis C virus are negative. Q: Are there any other thoughts on either ayurveda in general or Amrit that you'd like to share with our readers? Dr. Horner: To me, ayurveda is a godsend. It's something that I think will be part of the future of medicine. Integration of the modalities and techniques and principles of ayurveda with Western medicine is already happening. I would like to envision a time in the future where we use predominantly ayurveda to heal people, and only in those rare circumstances where somebody is injured or some disease gets out of control would we use Western medicine. I did in-depth research on the various systems of medicine that are currently in existence on the planet when I was getting ready to do the television show. I read about Shamanism, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Sufism and the traditional system of medicine in Mexico \u2014 everything that I could find to read. After reading all of that material, I concluded that ayurveda is the most complete and comprehensive traditional form of medicine that exists on the planet today. There is no other form of medicine that effectively teaches people how to be healthy and has the profound effects that it does. It never ceases to amaze me when I go through panchakarma \u2014 the power of these gentle therapies is unbelievable. Q: Do you want to share something about your new show with our readers? Dr. Horner: Sure. We're working on doing a series of half-hour programs to be aired on the Wisdom Television Network. Wisdom is a satellite dish network you can pick up anywhere in the United States if you have \"the dish\" and you can get it on cable in the top 17 markets in the country right now. We're planning on focusing our programming initially on evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine and the prevention, treatment and recovery from cancer. We chose to center the information around cancer because cancer is an epidemic that affects everyone. Statistically, in the United States one out of every three women gets cancer, and one out of every two men. People that have cancer really listen \u2014 they're very open and their family members are looking for ways to help protect themselves and help their loved ones too. We thought introducing alternative techniques in relationship to cancer provides a doorway through which many people will walk. And everything that you do to try to prevent cancer is essentially what you do to stay healthy anyway, so it really won't limit the information we want people to know. We're working with the National Foundation of Alternative Medicine, otherwise known as NFAM. They are a non-profit organization that has been in existence for about five years. They have traveled all over the world, to a hundred different clinics in over twenty different countries, looking at what people are doing worldwide to prevent, treat and recover from cancer. They are funding research to evaluate some of these therapies that look most promising, and then distributing that information. Ayurvedic principles and techniques will have a big presence on the show. For example, Amrit will be discussed for its ability to help reduce the side effects of chemotherapy and prevent cancer. [Panchakarma](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/panchakarma-for-vitality) will be recommended for prevention and for detoxification after treatment. [Transcendental Meditation](http://www.tm.org/)\u00ae will be covered as a way to reduce stress and improve overall quality of life. Paul was involved in a study a few years ago here in Cincinnati that looked at the benefits of [Transcendental Meditation](http://www.tm.org/)\u00ae in cancer patients. The cancer patients who were taught [TM](http://www.tm.org/) had a very significant improvement in their quality of life. Ayurveda will also be featured heavily in the prevention of cancer \u2014 because I think the research shows there is nothing more powerful than ayurveda for the prevention of disease and promotion of health. Q: Our readers are sure to find this series informative. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. Dr. Horner: It was my pleasure.
