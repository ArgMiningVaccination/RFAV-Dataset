As a consequence high volumes of plastic single-use products and complex plastic composites are rou- tinely used by the European health sector and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the impact these materials have on human health. We have known for decades that certain hazardous chemicals leach out of medical devices, such as phthalates in plastic tubing. One of Health Care Wit- hout Harm (HCWH) Europe's first campaigns focu- sed on the elimination of DEHP, the most common - ly used phthalate, in intravenous drips. Our work in this area has also highlighted the high exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) of new-borns receiving medical treatment using multiple devices. The endocrine-disrupting properties of these che- micals are now well established; we have seen an increase in endocrine-related diseases such as bre- ast and testicular cancers, thyroid disorders, infer- tility, and diabetes throughout Europe over the last decades. This second edition of Non-toxic Healthcare forms an important part of HCWH Europe's work to rai- se awareness about the presence of hazardous substances in medical devices and the consequent risks to patients. This report also contains a new chapter specifically examining the health impact of plastics in healthcare. HCWH Europe promotes the substitution of harm- ful substances by demonstrating that many alter- natives with safer toxicological profiles are available on the market. We aim to accelerate the shift to- wards substitution within the European healthcare sector, supported by research, evidence, collabo- ration, and greater awareness. Progressive manu - facturers, governments, health systems, hospitals, and health practitioners are starting to come toge- ther to lead this change; many European healthca - re providers have already moved to eliminate PVC, DEHP, and BPA from healthcare practice. HCWH Europe has highlighted a number of examples in recent years, some of which are listed in this report. Importantly, the move towards substitution needs to be further encouraged and supported by strong political and regulatory action, such as in France for example, where tubes and pipes containing DEHP are banned in paediatric, neonatal, and maternity departments in hospitals. The new Medical Devices Regulation introduces provisions that would help phase out endocrine disrupting chemicals, carcino- genic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances, and particularly phthalates in medical devices, if safer alternatives are available and technically feasible. This is a positive step and one that HCWH Europe will continue to follow and support through its im- plementation. Prevention is always better than cure, and this the- me is central to the recommendations laid out in this report. Opting for safer alternatives in health - care to prevent patients (particularly children and other vulnerable groups), from being exposed to to- xic chemicals will help prevent devastating lifelong long-term health consequences in these groups. In doing the healthcare sector will be fulfilling its duty to first do no harm. Will Clark, Executive Director - Health Care Without Harm (HCWH) EuropeFOREWORD Medical devices play a critical role in healthcare but may contain hazardous substances in their com- position that can leach into patients during their use and compromise patient safety. Concerns have been raised by different societal groups including governmental bodies, healthcare professionals, scientists and civil society organisations, regarding the potential health impacts of chemical exposure from medical devices, particularly for vulnerable population groups. In 2017, the European Council adopted the Medical Devices Regulation (MDR), fully applicable to medi- cal devices placed on the EU market as of 26 May 2020. Importantly, some of the provisions within this regulation have the potential to act as an en- gine for substituting medical devices that contain harmful chemicals with safer alternatives. Phthalates and Bisphenol A (BPA) are substances of particular concern that are often found in medical devices. Phthalates are commonly used as plastic softeners in PVC-based medical devices, whilst BPA is used to produce certain plastics such as polycar- bonates and epoxy resins that have applications in the medical device industry. A major concern sur- rounding these substances is that they are known endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which may interfere with the normal functioning of the human endocrine system and therefore present a hazard to different physiological and developmental pro- cesses. EDCs can impact upon the human body at very low concentrations and can combine with other endocrine disruptors to produce additive ef- fects. Despite difficulties to demonstrate a causal link, some associations between EDC exposure and diseases are apparent: evidence shows that foetu - ses, children, and pregnant women are the most vulnerable groups. Awareness of actions to eliminate harmful plastics must be increased within the healthcare sector, highlighting that a high level of patient care and safety can be maintained. Furthermore, as some of the most highly trusted community figures, he- althcare professionals have the capacity and moral obligation to educate the communities they serve and help trigger widespread beneficial behaviour changes in plastic use.Within this report, HCWH Europe examines the health impact of plastics in healthcare, and pre- sents a number of recommendations for policy makers, competent authorities, notified bodies and healthcare providers, to move towards non-toxic healthcare and minimise the risk to patients wit- hout compromising medical care: l European legislation must protect the most vulnerable groups. Consistent technical imple- mentation of Annex I.II.10.4 of the MDR must therefore be ensured. The benefit-risk assess - ment of the presence of hazardous chemicals in certain medical devices should therefore be subject to the most stringent conformity as- sessment procedures by a Notified Body l Devices should be subject to stringent com- pliance assessment of required labelling by a Competent Authority. Information labelled in accordance with the MDR must be accessible to the public via the revamped European Data- base on Medical Devices (EUDAMED) l The market authorisation process for medical devices needs increased transparency l Sustainable procurement guidelines should provide incentives for the substitution of ha- zardous chemicals in medical devices l Funding for research and development of alter- native substances and products and for clinical and epidemiological projects that compare the performance of these alternatives should be prioritised.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 5 4 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)Medical devices are an essential feature of modern healthcare, playing an important role in prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of diseases and disabilities. Hazardous chemicals are often present in medical devices to improve plastic per- formance e.g. plasticisers, flame-retardants, fillers, colourings, impact modifiers, and stabilisers. These harmful chemicals can represent a high percentage of the final product (in some case up to 80%) and can leach out of products and have adverse effects on human health and the environment. Concerns regarding hazardous chemical exposure through medical devices are particularly relevant to groups of vulnerable patients that undergo multip- le medical interventions or are exposed chronically over extended periods, including infants in neona - tal care or dialysis patients. Substances that are commonly found in medical devices and are of particular concern are phthala - tes and Bisphenol A (BPA). These substances have been the subject of intense political debate in re- cent years due to their widespread use in consu- mer products and the risks they pose to human health and the environment. The endocrine-dis- rupting properties of these chemicals are also well established. Hazard of chemicals contained in medical devices Humans are exposed to environmental contami - nants from several sources and exposure pathways, including consumption of contaminated food and water, air and dust inhalation/ingestion, and dermal absorption. Human biomonitoring studies have de- tected hazardous chemicals like phthalates and BPA in almost every individual analysed and in a va- riety of human tissues and fluids such as placental tissue, breast milk, amniotic fluid, urine, blood, cord blood, sperm, and saliva.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The majority of studies show widespread exposure to phthalates in unborn children and infants across Europe. The new European Human Biomonitoring (HBM4EU) Initiativei (2017-2021) aims to coordinate and ad- vance human biomonitoring in Europe. The project represents a joint effort of Members States, the European Environment Agency, and the European Commission. One of the objectives of HBM4EU is to generate scientific evidence on the causal relation- ships between exposure to prioritised chemicals (including phthalates and bisphenols) and the ad- verse health effects and public health implications. One of the major reasons for concern surrounding phthalates and BPA is that they are known endo- crine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that can mimic or otherwise interfere with hormone production or function. EDCs can therefore interfere with organ formation and growth, sexual maturation, stress re- sponse, and behaviour.10 As traditional risk assess - i www.hbm4eu.euINTRODUCTION BOX 1 EU definition of a medical device (Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices1) Any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, implant, reagent, material, or other article inten- ded by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination, for human beings for one or more of the following specific medical purposes: lDiagnosis, prevention, monitoring, predic - tion, prognosis, treatment, or alleviation of disease l Diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, allevia- tion of, or compensation for, an injury or disability l Investigation, replacement or modifica- tion of the anatomy or of a physiological or pathological process or state l Providing information by means of in vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body, including organ, blood, and tissue donations This does not include devices/treatments that achieve the principal intended action by phar- macological, immunological or metabolic me- ans, in or on the human body, but a medical device may be assisted in its function by such means.ment procedures lack integration of endocrinolo- gy concepts, the effects of EDCs in human health and the environment are mostly dismissed in the existing risk assessment framework. In particular, effects from early life, chronic low-dose, and/or multiple simultaneous exposures are not taken into consideration. Increased incidence of diseases and illnesses in humans from neonatal/infancy through to adulthood has been associated with exposure to these substances.4 10 In 2015, the Endocrine Society reviewed the latest science and declared that the evidence for adverse reproductive effects is strong and mounting for effects in areas such as neuroen - docrine, sexual development, obesity, metabolism, thyroid systems, and insulin resistance. Further, the effects may also be transmitted to future generati - ons.11 A European Parliament study reviewed the scienti- fic evidence of endocrine disruption, the extent of EDC exposure, and the associated health effects and consequent costs of treatment. Published in May 2019, the study concluded that after several decades of multidisciplinary research in endocrino- logy, ecotoxicology, toxicology, epidemiology, clini- cal research, epigenetics, environmental sciences and other disciplines, endocrine disruption is now an important and validated scientific concept.12 The evidence therefore justifies classifying EDCs as a specific class of hazard, equivalent to that of car- cinogenic, mutagenic, reprotoxic chemicals (CMRs). Researchers and healthcare practitioners are par- ticularly concerned that exposure to EDCs from medical devices compounds adds to the existing exposure from other sources: EDCs are ubiquitous and the entire population is already exposed. Furt- hermore, vulnerable population groups such as neonates, infants, pregnant and breast-feeding wo- men, and the elderly are not adequately protected from the risk of exposure to these chemicals. The most at risk groups comprises dialysis patients and neonates in intensive care units, as they experien- ce frequent and intimate contact with a number of medical devices containing EDCs. Premature babies and infants are particularly sensitive to phthalate effects, as their reproductive system is still develo- ping and they have much higher relative phthalates intakes. In addition, the unborn and young children are not able to metabolise chemical substances in the same way as adults, due to the on-going de- velopment of their organs and maturation of the different systems (see Box 5). Despite claims that exposure to hazardous chemi- cals through medical devices represents a small proportion of an individual's overall exposure, this exposure can be harmful for patients as they will be primarily from the vulnerable populations and/ or maybe rendered more susceptible to toxic insult through (critical) illness. A precautionary approach and eliminating exposure to hazardous chemicals wherever possible is therefore appropriate in the case of medical devices and recognised under the BOX 2 What are phthalates? Phthalates are a group of chemical substan - ces, primarily used as plasticisers (softeners) in plastics to make them more flexible. Depen- ding on the number of carbon atoms in their alkyl side-chains they are divided into: l High-chain length - with more than six car- bons (e.g. DINP, DIDP, DPHP, and DIUP) l Transitional-chain carbons (e.g. DEHP, DBP, DIBP and BBP) l Low-chain length three car- bons. (e.g. DEP and DMP) Phthalates are abundant in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) medical devices such as blood bags, in- travenous bags, tubing, catheters, respiratory masks, or disposable gloves - approximately 40% of all plastic-based medical devices are made from PVC.13 Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) has for many years been the most commonly used phthala - te ester plasticiser in medical devices. A 2014 survey in the Danish Medical Device Industry found that 95% of products contained DEHP.14 DEHP can contribute up to 40% of weight of intravenous bags and up to 80% of weight in medical tubing.15 Leaching of DEHP from PVC medical devices has been documented since the late 1960s.16 17 18 Use of PVC medical de- vices may lead to a higher exposure to DEHP than everyday sources affecting the general population.19 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 7 6 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)Hazard for human health There is growing evidence that many phthalates and BPA can present a hazard to human health and are recognised in the EU as endocrine-disrupting compounds. Evidence comes from in vitro and ani- mal studies as well as clinical and epidemiological studies encompassing both prenatal and postnatal exposures. The effects of DEHP in animals has been thoroughly reviewed by Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR)19 which concluded that i) the testis toxicity of DEHP is age dependent, with immature animals being more susceptible to testicular toxicity by DEHP than ol- der mature animals; ii) even low-level exposures to DEHP during pregnancy can affect male genital de- velopment.24 A review of human epidemiology studies found a higher risk of male reproductive disorders after prenatal and postnatal exposure to phthalates.25 It has been proven that phthalates can transfer from mothers to foetuses and neonates through placen- ta and breast milk.26 Exposure to DEHP and DBP has been linked with reproductive alteration inclu- ding low sperm concentration, shortened anogeni - tal distances (a measure of feminisation of exter- nal genitalia), endometriosis, hypospadias, shorter pregnancy duration, changes in neurobehaviour in neonates, infants and children, cholestasis, derma- titis, heart disease and perturbations in inflamma - tory responses.27 28 29 30 31 32 A recent comprehensive and critical review addressed the health hazards posed by phthalates on children and adolescents, including reproductive toxicity in women and men, cancer, insulin resistance and type II diabetes, over- weight and obesity, allergy and asthma.6 Growing evidence suggests that prenatal phthalate exposu- res may have neurodevelopmental consequences33 34 35 36 and can affect IQ, attention, hyperactivity, and social communication of children.37 38 Exposures to BPA are associated with many health effects in humans, including reproductive effects (erectile dysfunction, miscarriage), cardiovascular diseases, thyroid, immune and metabolic diseases (diabetes), childhood obesity as well as general/ab - dominal obesity and hypertension, neurodevelop- ment impairments, respiratory conditions and behaviour alterations (anxiousness, hyperactivity, depression).39 40 41 42 43 BPA has recently also been suggested to be an emerging threat to male infer- tility.44 Particularly worrying is the fact that exposure to phthalates and Bisphenol A can lead to cumulative adverse effects on future generations such as neu - ral and immune disorders, infertility, and late-onset complex diseases (cancers and diabetes).45 Exposure through medical devices Exposure to hazardous chemicals through medi- cal devices can be enteral (via the digestive tract), parenteral (intravenously), transcutaneous (via the skin), or through inhalation. Dietary exposure to phthalates and BPA is expected to account for the majority of human exposure. Several studies have described phthalates, (particularly DEHP), leaching from medical devices and recorded levels in uri- ne and blood. The leaching of DEHP from medical plastic devices into body fluids and subsequent mi- gration into human tissues was first reported in the late 1960s.16 Nearly 60 years after this discovery, regulators are still struggling to define and manage BOX 3 What is Bisphenol A? Bisphenol A (4,4-dihydroxy-2,2-diphenylpropa- ne or BPA) is a chemical substance used as a monomer in the production of polymers such as polycarbonate, epoxy resins, polysulfone, and polyacrylate. BPA is also used as an an- tioxidant and inhibitor in the polymerisation of PVC and as a precursor for the synthesis of the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). Up to 1 million tonnes of BPA is ma- nufactured and/or imported in the European Economic Area (EEA) annuallyiii, from which over 95% of BPA is used in the production of polycarbonates and epoxy resins.20 21 BPA has applications in medical devices that have both direct and indirect contact with pa- tients including those made of polycarbonate, polysulfone, and PVC such as medical tubing, catheters, haemodialysers, newborn incuba- tors, syringes and blood oxygenators. BPA has been shown to leach from medical devices into liquids.22 23 European PVC manufacturers informed the Scientific Committee on Emer - ging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCE- NIHR) that they no longer use BPA as stabiliser or antioxidant in PVC production.23 ii https://echa.europa.eu/the potential human health risks posed by DEHP in medical devices. According to the SCENIHR premature neonates in neonatal intensive care units, infants subjected to repeated medical treatment using medical devices, and patients undergoing haemodialysis are at risk of DEHP-induced effects.19 Patients in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are exposed to phthalate mixtures through the complex materials used con- currently in NICU care: respiratory circuits, intrave- nous equipment, enteral feeding supplies, and in- cubators are likely vehicles of phthalate exposure.46 Whilst evidence of BPA leaching into patients is more limited, dialysers, dental materials, circula- tion equipment, neonatal care medical devices, and urinary catheters have demonstrated releases of BPA.23 Length of contact time (duration of expo- sure), temperature and pH, among other parame- ters, has been shown to increase the release of BPA from polycarbonate.23 The SCENIHR opinion on the safety of the use of Bisphenol A in medical devices concluded that there is a risk when BPA is directly available for systemic exposure after non-oral ex- posure routes, especially for neonates in intensive care units, infants undergoing prolonged medical procedures, and for dialysis patients.23 The risk of adverse effects due to BPA may exist in patients un- dergoing dialysis treatment since BPA accumulates in systemic circulation due to reduced renal clea- rance. Although the benefit of medical devices has also to be considered, the SCENIHR recommends that, where practical, medical devices that do not leach BPA should be used.23 With the exception of dialysis patients (for which treatment is repeated over long time periods and can be considered si- milar to chronic exposure), the exposure to BPA via medical devices is generally of limited duration (re- presentative of acute to sub-chronic exposure in a toxicological context). A number of observations from the scientific lite- rature are available, confirming the link between use of plastics in medical devices and exposure of patients to phthalates and/or BPA. A strong asso - ciation was found between the use of DEHP-contai - ning medical devices and urinary concentrations of three DEHP metabolites in infants receiving care in two neonatal intensive care units.47 DEHP leached from endotracheal tubes immediately after use in high-risk neonates.48 Premature neonates receiving treatment through feeding tubes and endotracheal tubes had increased levels of DEHP in their urine.49 Certain vulnerable patients groups such neonates / children are exposed during intense care to mul- tiple invasive medical procedures and therefore to multiple medical devices simultaneously, sequenti - ally, or intermittently.50 51 Neonates in intensive care are exposed to DEHP at much higher levels than existing safe limits, which might contribute to com- mon early and chronic complications of prematu- rity.52 Premature infants in neonatal intensive care units undergoing treatment were also found to have BPA levels 10 times higher than the general population, presumably from BPA leaching from medical devi- ces.53 Infants in neonatal intensive care units using a large number of PVC-containing medical devices had also higher concentrations of urinary BPA (one order of magnitude higher than the median con- centration of the general population in the US).54 Recent clinical studies provide information about the overall significant exposure to BPA during hae - modialysis treatment in patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD).55 A recent study de- monstrated overexposure to BPA and its chlorina- ted derivatives of patients with ESRD during online haemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) due to BPA leaching from different medical devices.56 The materials used in medical devices are also an important factor. In one study, BPA concentrations among infants in one healthcare unit were approxi- mately 17 times higher than another unit.54 Patients undergoing regular continuous ambulatory peri- toneal dialysis using plasticiser-free devices had reduced levels of phthalates in urine and blood.57 Moreover, the level of cholestasis in neonates was reduced from 50% to 13% in neonates fed through a DEHP-free catheter.58 A growing number of studies suggest the link bet- ween exposure of patients to phthalates and/or BPA from medical devices and adverse effects in exposed patients. There is emerging evidence that the use of medical devices containing DEHP is po- tentially harmful for the brain development and function of critically ill children. Belgian clinicians identified a clear link between previously hospita- lised children's long-term neurocognitive test re- sults and their individual exposure to the phthalate DEHP during their stay in intensive care.59 Critically ill children had very high circulating levels of phtha- late metabolites, explained by leaching from medi- cal devices, and these levels were associated with the significant attention-deficit observed four years later. Another recent study highlighted the impact of acu- te mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP, the primary metabolite of DEHP) exposure on cardiac electrop- hysiology in the heart. It concluded that heightened NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 9 8 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)clinical exposure to plasticised medical products might have cardiac safety implications.60 Several clinical observations point to the possible involve- ment of BPA/DEHP exposure in dialysis patients in- creased cardiovascular (CV) mortality and sudden cardiac death (SCD).61 As emphasised by the aut- hors, importantly, BPA/DEHP exposure may be a modifiable risk factor for SCD in dialysis as alternati - ves to BPA and DEHP do exist and could potentially be used as replacements for dialysis procedures. Replacement of BPA- and DEHP-leaching plastics may reduce morbidity and mortality of patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis and of other patients un- dergoing invasive interventions with prolonged ex- posure to plastics (e.g. cardiac surgery). Prospective clinical studies and randomised controlled trials are needed to test this hypothesis. These data strongly support SCENIHR's recommen - dation to use medical devices with low DEHP and BPA release potential, whenever possible. BOX 4 Medical procedures with potential for high exposure to DEHP19 and BPA23 l Exchange transfusion of blood in neon - ates l Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment of neonates and of adults l Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) in neon - ates l Multiple procedures in sick neonates l Haemodialysis l Enteral nutrition in neonates and adults l Heart transplantation or coronary artery bypass graft surgery l Massive blood transfusion of red blood cells and plasma l Peritoneal dialysis Six scenarios considered as representative situations of release of BPA from medical de - vices: 1. External contact with a medical device containing BPA 2. Contact with oral/dental material and/or orthodontic equipment 3. Contact with implants such as valves, pacemakers and insulin dispensers made from polycarbonate 4. Haemodialysis 5. Prolonged surgical procedures such as bypass operations and transplantations 6. Prolonged exposure to different sources of BPA in intensive care units.Hazards for the environment Phthalates and BPA have been detected in aquatic and marine environments, terrestrial ecosystems and in the atmosphere in concentrations that are likely to adversely affect a number of species.62 63 These substances have also been shown to bioac- cumulate in some species of molluscs and crusta- ceans.64 Phthalates have been measured in a range of environmental matrices, including sludge, dust, soil, air, and water, and are ubiquitous contami - nants in the environment. Phthalates and BPA can reach the environment from industrial discharges, sewage, landfill leachates and natural breakdown of plastics in the environment. DEHP (authorisation list)65 and BPA (candidate list)66 are both classified by the European Commission as \"toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects\" and endocrine disrupting chemical for environment. Data collected from wildlife studies, laboratory ex-periments and in vitro studies show that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of BPA have shown detrimental effects in invertebrates and all vertebrate classes.63 Similarly, exposure to different phthalates and/or their metabolites has caused adverse effects at various endpoints in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant ex- posures.67 There are studies that indicate that BPA can especially affect development, reproduction, immune function and metabolism in aquatic speci- es.68 Besides the chemical contamination of a wide range of natural habitats, these compounds also create a waste management problem. The disposal of PVC medical waste can release dioxins and ot- her persistent environmental pollutants, which can have a detrimental impact on human health and the environment. The European legal framework on hazar- dous chemicals in medical devices European medical devices manufacturers have to comply not only with the EU Medical Devices Re- gulation 2017/745 but also with a number of che- mical regulations - the EU Regulation 1907/2006 on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the EU Direc- tive 2011/65/EU on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronical Equipment (RoHS II). The REACH Regulation The REACH regulation makes a distinction between medical devices that are: l Chemical substances, either on their own or as mixtures. Examples of mixtures include lu- bricants, dental filling materials and bone ce- ments. l Articles (that is, objects with a function deter- mined by their shape, surface or design rather than their chemical composition (Article 3.3). Examples include catheters, contact lenses and medical implants. In practice, most medical devices are likely to quali- fy as articles under REACH. A medical device that qualifies as a substance/ mixture is subject to most of the requirements of REACH, including registration. Pursuant to Articles 60(2) and 62(6) of REACH, an application for aut- horisation is not required for a substance used in a medical device. Article 60(2) states that the Com- mission shall not consider the risks to human health BOX 5 Why neonates and children are more vulnerable The levels of exposure to hazardous chemi- cals are of particular concern for unborn chil- dren, neonates, and children. These groups are being exposed to hazardous chemicals at a highly vulnerable moment when important aspects of their development can be altered, perhaps with lifelong consequences. Further- more, their low body weight means the expo- sure can be relatively higher than for adults. Premature babies are subject to an even hig- her risk due to their lower birth weight com- bined with the fact they require many medi- cal interventions. In addition, the unborn and young are not able to metabolise chemical substances in the same way as adults, due to the on-going development of their organs and maturation of the different systems. For exam - ple, the glucuronidation mechanisms that are responsible for the excretion of some phthala - te metabolites are not fully developed before the age of 3 months.3 Finally, expected longer life spans could mean that this group will be exposed for a longer time to these substan - ces. All these factors may put this group at an increased risk of suffering deleterious effects. NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 11 10 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)RoHS II Directive The RoHS II Directive (2011/65/EU) was adopted to limit the concentration of six hazardous substances (including lead, mercury and toxic flame retardants) in electrical and electronic equipment with a view to contributing to the protection of human health and the environment. From July 2014, the RoHS II Directive also applies to electrical and electronic medical devices. In vitro medical devices are cove- red from July 2016 and active implantable medical devices are exempted. Additional exemptions have been added (Annex IV), specific to medical devices and monitoring and control instruments for which a reliable alternative was not available. Directive (EU) 2015/863 (often referred to as \"RoHS 3\") amends Directive 2011/65/EU adding four sub- stances to view of their negati - ve impact on recycling and on human health and the environment during electrical and electronic waste management operations. The longer innova -tion cycles for medical devices and monitoring and control instruments were taken into account while determining the transitional period. Consequently, the restriction of the use of DEHP, BBP, DBP and DIBP applies to medical devices, including in vitro medical devices, and monitoring and control instru- ments, including industrial monitoring and control instruments, from 22 July 2021. The Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) The new MDR aims to create a modernised and more robust EU legislative framework to ensure better protection of public health and patient safety and include, among others, stronger rules on clini- cal and performance evaluation, reinforced desig- nation and oversight processes of Notified Bodies, establishment of a comprehensive EU database on medical devices (EUDAMED) to be made publicly available, and stricter requirements related to the use of hazardous substances. When the MDR takes effect in May 2020, manufacturers will have to com- ply with new rules for almost every kind of product Phthalate CAS number Reason for Toxic for reproduction reproduction 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, linearCAS 84777-06-0 Toxic for reproductionTABLE 1 Phthalates in the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern (REACH)66Phthalate CAS number Reason for inclusion DIPP: Toxic 85-68-7 Toxic for 117-81-7 properties for Endocri- properties for environment 84-74-2 Toxic for reproductionPhthalates in the Authorisation List65 arising from the use of a substance in a medical de- vice regulated by the MDR. Nonetheless, suppliers, distributors or retailers of medical devices have the duty to communicate information about the pre- sence of Substances of Very High Concern - SVHCs if requested by a consumer in 45 days (Article 33). Several phthalates are classified as toxic for repro- duction under the EU Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on the classification, labelling and packaging of sub- stances and mixtures (the CLP Regulation) and are listed on the Candidate List of SVHCs under REACH (see Table 1). Seven of those phthalates had subse - quently been added to the Authorisation List (An- nex XIV of REACH) due to their classification as toxic for reproduction (see Table 1). The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has recent- ly submitted a recommendation to the European Commission to amend Authorisation List entries by adding the endocrine disrupting properties of DEHP, BBP, DBP, and DIBP.69 They were identified as substances of very high concern (SVHCs) due to endocrine disrupting properties with effects on hu- man health. DEHP was also identified for its effects on the environment. One important impact of this is that the REACH authorisation process will be able to address - and work to phase out in the longer term - the use of DEHP in medical devices. The aut- horisation process places significant emphasis on the substitution of affected substances. The actual amendment of the entries including the final deci- sion on the dates, by which companies will need to apply for authorisation to ECHA and on exemptions of uses, will be made by the European Commission in collaboration with the Member States and the European Parliament. In the case of BPA, this has been classified as toxic for reproduction, an EDC for human health and an EDC for environment, and listed on the Candidate List of SVHCs under REACH in 2017. However, Plas- ticsEuropeiiii (the leading pan-European industrial association) brought a case to the EU court against BPA's classification as a SVHC and against the iden- tification of BPA as an endocrine disruptor with im- pact on health. This year, the General Court of the EU dismissed both claims. PlasticsEurope also chal- lenged the identification of BPA as an endocrine disruptor with impact on the environment in a third case (the judgment is expected in November 2019). iii https://www.plasticseurope.org/en NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 13 12 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)in the medical device spectrum. According to the new EU Medical Devices Regula- tion, \"Devices shall be designed and manufactured in such a way as to reduce as far as possible the risks po- sed by substances or particles, including wear debris, degradation products and processing residues, that may be released from the device.\" Annex I.II.10.4 of the MDR introduces provisions that would help phase out endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), carcinogenic, mutagenic and re- protoxic substances (CMRs), and phthalates in me- dical devices if safer alternatives are available and technically feasible. Manufacturers of medical de- vices are required to provide adequate justification (benefit-risk assessment) to the Notified Body for the presence of those substances if they are pre- sent above a certain concentration (see Box 6). The term \"notified body\" refers to the typically private companies charged with evaluating the quality and safety of medical devices in the EU. The Scientific Committee on Health, Environmen - tal and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) of the European Commission prepared the Guidelines on the benefit- risk assessment of the presence of phthalates in certain medical devices covering phthalates, which are carci - nogenic, mutagenic, and toxic to reproduction (CMR) or have endocrine disrupting (ED) properties.70 Before a justification can be accepted as valid, seve - ral steps need to be taken, including giving conside- ration to the possible use of alternative substances, materials, designs, and medical treatments. In ad- dition, the risk in terms of hazards associated with such alternatives should be weighed against the risk of the use of CMR 1A/1B and/or ED identified phthalates covered under MDR Annex I Chapter II point 10.4.1. However, the risk by itself is not the only parameter to consider; an evaluation must also be made of the impact of the possible alter- natives on the functionality, the performance and the overall benefit-risk ratio of the medical device. These Guidelines are intended to be used by the relevant stakeholders, e.g. manufacturers, notified bodies and regulatory bodies. The approach taken in these Guidelines may also be used for a benefit- risk assessment of other CMR/ED substances pre- sent in medical devices. As foreseen by the MDR, adherence to these Guidelines will become man - datory.The presence of hazardous substances (subject to justification) will have to be indicated on the me- dical devices' labelling (in accordance with provisi- ons laid down in Annex I.II.10.4.5). It also specifies that, if such devices are intended to treat children or pregnant or nursing women, the manufacturer should provide information on residual risks for these patient groups and if applicable on appro- priate precautionary measures (see Box 7). Information labelled in accordance with this annex is one of the mandatory Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) data elements to be provided by the manu - facturer to the UDI database. This information on the devices will be accessible to the public via the European Database on Medical Devices (EUDA- MED). EUDAMED's purpose is to strengthen market sur- veillance and transparency in the field of medical devices, by providing national Competent Authori- ties with fast access to information. EUDAMED in current form contains data on medical devices that have been collected and entered by Competent Authorities and the European Commission and is currently only accessible by these parties. The MDR, however, calls for EUDAMED to be revamped: the information will be more comprehensive and ac-BOX 7 Regulation (EU) 2017/745, Annex I.II.10.4 (Substances: 10.4.5.

If the intended use of such devices includes treatment of children or treatment of preg- nant or breastfeeding women or treatment of other patient groups considered particularly vulnerable to such substances and/or materi- als, information on residual risks for those pa- tient groups and, if applicable, on appropriate precautionary measures shall be given in the instructions for use.cess will be extended. The database will not only be used by the Competent Authorities and the Euro- pean Commission, it will also be accessed by the Medical Devices Coordination Group (MDCG), No- tified Bodies, Economic Operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers, sponsors), experts, and the public, including medical instituti- ons. Creating greater transparency will allow for a better understanding of what medical devices are placed on the EU market and who is ultimately responsi- ble for them. The level of access, however, will differ between the types of user. Theoretically, procurers (such as hospitals and Com- petent Authorities) will be able to access, search, and filter the content of EUDAMED to identify safer medical devices for their procurement process. Originally, the new database's launch was suppo- sed to coincide with the date of application for the MDR in May 2020. However, in October 2019, the Commission announced that the launch would be delayed by two years. The Commission plans to have the new database ready when another piece of legislation \u2014 the in vitro diagnostics regulation \u2014 comes into full effect in May 2022.BOX 6 Regulation (EU) 2017/745, Annex I.II.10.4 (Substances: 10.4.1.

Many alternative substances and materials have appeared in recent years for many of the most hazardous chemicals used in medical devices, in- cluding for phthalates and BPA. There is a choice now to be made between safer alternatives or ig- noring the potential dangers to patients. The new European legislation was long in the making, but with the MDR there is a real opportunity to accele- rate the process of phasing-out phthalates and BPA and minimise patients, and in particular vulnerable groups, exposure to these harmful chemicals. We are all exposed to endocrine disrupters from multiple sources, but healthcare should not be one of these. As Kambia and co-authors stated already more than fifteen years ago, when exposures to hazardous chemicals in medical devices can be avoided through careful selection of materials, not doing it is both unprofessional and undesi - rable.71 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 15 14 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)Exposure to phthalates or BPA can be minimised by adopting a precautionary approach and repla- cing medical devices with phthalate-free and BPA- free devices, which can fulfil the same function. The precautionary principle is enshrined in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (EU) and aims to ensure a high level of en- vironmental, consumer and human health protecti- on through preventive decision-making in the case of risk. Nevertheless, the decision whether or not to apply the precautionary principle appears to be poorly defined, with ambiguities inherent in deter- mining what level of uncertainty and significance of hazard justifies invoking it.72 Decision makers prefer to wait until overwhelming scientific evidence is gat- hered, often taking a long time to achieve, and po- tentially delaying action to a point where risks and effects cannot be undone. On the European market, several manufacturers offer products where phthalates/PVC or BPA have been replaced by alternative materials or substan - ces. In the case of the phthalates, phthalate-free or PVC-free medical devices are available for nearly all product categories except blood bags (see Box 8). Many hospitals have already made considerable progress, having adopted phase-out policies and committing to using products that are less harmful for patients. However, most of these initiatives are only happening due to the commitment of indivi- duals and in spite of a lack of political or regulatory impetus. In a project for the European Commission's Direc- torate General Environment, the Swedish Environ- mental Management Council developed a set of EU Green Public Procurement (GPP) criteria with re- gards to electrical and electronic medical devices. In 2014, the creation of Green Public Procurement Criteria about electrical and electronic medical de- vices missed the opportunity to incorporate a crite- rion on phasing out BPA due to insufficient scienti- fic evidence and supply chain transparency. Given the growing amount of data and new tools available to track the presence of substances, updating this policy tool would better support sustainable procu- rement strategies aimed at phasing out hazardous chemicals.CHAPTER 1 BOX 8 PVC-free Blood Bag project The PVC-free Blood Bag Project (www.pvcfree- bloodbag.eu) was a Life+ collaborative initiati- ve between industry and the healthcare sector that aimed to demonstrate that it is possible to produce a blood bag without using PVC. The project, which was completed in 2017, has shown that it is possible to produce a comple- tely PVC-free set of four bags, which can store red blood cells and fulfil the requirement spe- cifications including a gap analysis for CE-mar - king.73 The majority of Swedish healthcare providers and other organisations, including Health Care Without Harm Europe, supported this Initiative, and Karolinska University Hospital is now working towards a PVC-free blood pro- cessing and storage system. Their objective is to identify a partner with the ability to launch PVC-free blood bags on the European market. Demonstrating widespread demand is critical to achieving that goal and other European he- althcare providers are invited to show support for this initiative by signing a Letter of Intent, available here: (https://www.karolinska.se/en/karolinska-univer- sity-hospital/about-karolinska/environment-and- sustainability/pvc-free-blood-bag/ ).Governmental Initiatives Three European countries - Denmark, France and Germany - have taken legislative steps to reduce the use of phthalates and/or BPA. All three count- ries have addressed, to varying degrees, the issue of DEHP-containing medical devices and provide political support to efforts to improve healthcare in this regard. The Nordic Council of Ministers, the official inter-governmental body for cooperation in the Nordic Region also promotes the Swan Ecola- bel, which among other product categories also in- cludes certain healthcare products. As all cases were described in the previous edition of Non-toxic Healthcare report76, and only new in- formation has been included in 2019 edition. Since 1 July 2015 tubing/pipes containing DEHP have been banned for use in paediatric, neonatal, and maternity departments in hospitals in France. This law also paves the way for a future ban on DEHP and other phthalates in all medical devices if alternative materials are available and the equip- ment's safety can be guaranteed. The French National Agency for the Safety of Medi- cines and Health Products (ANSM) tested medical devices on the French market, targeting 3 thera- peutic areas in which PVC devices were presented as DEHP-free: haemodialysis, enteral feeding and infusion.77 During market surveillance ANSM obser- ved that a large number (around 70%) of these de- vices in which DEHP was not added as plasticiser, actually contained residual quantities of DEHP, with however, concentrations lower than 1,000 ppm (0.1%) being observed for most of them. Non-Governmental Initiatives The Safer Medical Devices Database by HCWH Europe One of the issues that hospitals face when start- ing a phase-out programme for phthalates or BPA is knowing what alternatives are available and the impact and effectiveness of the alternative. Enga - gement and communication with manufacturers is therefore essential. To enable healthcare procurers to identify medical devices that do not contain PVC and/or DEHP or BPA, and that are already available on the European market, HCWH Europe launched in 2014 an online listing of DEHP-free, PVC-free or BPA-free medical products available in the Euro- pean market - the Safer Medical Devices Database (safermedicaldevices.org ). Manufacturers, procurers and anyone else working in the healthcare sector that would like to provide information about PVC-, DEHP- or BPA-free medical devices, are invited to do so. The Swedish Substitution List by the Substitution group on chemicals The Swedish regions and counties and the Swedish Environmental Management Council, through the NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 17 16 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)Progress made by the industry Eastman Chemical Company has teamed up with BloodCenter of Wisconsin (BCW) on a cli- nical trial evaluating a new plasticiser for blood bags. The aim of the trial is to evaluate the stability of red blood cells in di-2-ethylhexyl te- rephthalate (DEHT) plasticised containers com- pared phthalate (DEHP) plasticised containers. The trial expan- ded upon the use of DEHT as an alternative to DEHP for bags to store red blood cells in AS-1 and PAGGSM preservative solutions. The trial concluded that DEHT, a non-phthalate gene - ral-purpose plasticizer, is a viable alternative to DEHP. Although structurally and functional - ly similar to DEHP, DEHT (or Eastman 168 SG) is metabolically distinct with a comprehensive and benign toxicology profile.74 \"PVC blood bags without phthalates of concern are just around the corner\" 75Substituting hazardous chemicals in medical devicesnational Substitution Group on chemicals, maintain and regularly update a Substitution List for hazar - dous substances in the healthcare sector, available online.78 The Substitution List compiles information on products available in the Swedish market to help healthcare procurers make healthier and more in- formed choices. Products are organised by product category (use), and possible alternatives of the ha- zardous substances are listed for each product, in- cluding at least one supplier. The Substitution Portal by Kooperations - stelle Hamburg IFE GmbH and partners The Substitution Support Portal - SUBSPORT (http:// www.subsport.eu) - is a Kooperationsstelle Ham- burg IFE GmbH (a consultancy based in Germany), the International Chemical Secretariat - ChemSec (a non-profit organisation based in Sweden), Gront- mij (a consultancy based in Denmark) and the Sindical de Trabajo, Ambiente y Salud - ISTAS (a technical body of one of the Spanish workers unions). The project aims to provide useful informa - tion on substitution and provide resources to tho- se interested in substituting hazardous chemicals in products. The Case Story database in the portal includes the assessment of alternative substances for ten substances or groups of substances of high concern - including BPA - plus several case studies from hospitals. The GreenScreen\u00ae Chemicals Alternative Assessment and the Plastics Scorecard by the Clean Production Action The GreenScreen\u00ae for Safer Chemicals79, developed by the non-profit organisation Clean Production Ac- tion80, employs an open, transparent methodology to perform chemical hazard assessment. A wide range of professionals, governmental and non-go - vernmental bodies and manufacturers use it to assess the hazard of chemicals and their potential effect on human health and the environment. The goal is to push for the substitution of hazardous chemicals by safer alternatives.The ChemSec Marketplace The Marketplace (https://marketplace.chemsec.org/) is a business to business website where buyers and sellers of alternatives to hazardous chemicals can interact. Not only does it provide a unique market opportunity for producers of safer alternatives, but also a one-stop shop for downstream user compa- nies looking to substitute hazardous chemicals in their products. Chemicals substitution by INERIS This website (https://substitution.ineris.fr/en), set up by the French National Institute for Industrial En- vironment and Risks (INERIS) provides support to economic operators engaged in a substitution ap- proach in order to promote the dissemination and sharing of information. The website currently offers information provided by companies on the alterna - tives available for three families of substances: bis- phenols, phthalates and alkylphenol ethoxylates. They are illustrated by concrete applications and include medical devices.Alternative substances for replacing phthalates exist for a number of products, including the ma- jority of applications in medical devices. Several companies already manufacture DEHP-free medi- cal devices, either by using PVC plasticisers other than DEHP or by avoiding the use of PVC material altogether.15 A survey of the Denmark medical industry showed that in 2014, 95% of the manufacturers still used DEHP.81 However, 60% of the companies had also products that do not contain phthalates, and 80% of those using phthalates believed that substitution should not be problematic over a period of 3-5 ye- ars.81 No clinical studies have systematically compared the health outcomes of different substances used in medical devices, particularly comparing DEHP and other phthalates with alternatives. Nonethe - less, a number of studies from manufacturers, regulatory agencies, researchers and NGOs have looked into alternatives for phthalates or PVC in medical devices.19 82 83 In 2014, the Danish Environmental Protection Agency published a report looking at alternative plasticisers in medical devices to DEHP, BBP, DBP and DIBP. The overall purpose of the report was to come up with a list of alternatives to help guide ma- nufacturers of medical devices to substitute these plasticisers.14 The report screened available infor- mation existing in the REACH registration dossiers for a list of substances and found that the values of the \"no effect level\" (DNEL) for the general popula- tion were all higher in comparison with DEHP, mea - ning these substances would in principle be safer than DEHP.14 In the Plastics Scorecard: Evaluating the Chemical Footprint of Plastics report, the plastic footprint of polyolefin and PVC in IV bags was com- pared.83 The results of the comparison showed that the substitution of PVC bags by polyolefin-based polymers greatly reduced the chemical footprint of the products. The plasticisers industry has been investing and developing alternatives to DEHP in medical devi- ces. These alternatives have been included in the European Pharmacopoeia since 2018. Today, ot- being proposed in medical applications, such as medical tubing and blood bags. Tables summarising the applications, advantages, disadvantages, toxicity and main knowledge gaps relating to known alternative plasticisers to phtha- lates or known alternative polymers to PVC were in- cluded in the previous edition of Non-toxic Health- care report.76 These have been moved to the Safer Medical Devices Database (safermedicaldevices.org ) with the intention of keeping them updated as and when appropriate evidence becomes available. A concern that has been raised by a study from Genay et al. (2011).84 and by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Pro- ducts77 is that not all DEHP-free devices are in prac- tice DEHP-free, as DEHP was present in small quan- tities (below 0.1% by weight). These results point to the necessity for manufacturers to verify the purity of raw materials for all plastics used in the compo- sition of the various parts of a medical device and not just PVC.CHAPTER 2 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 19 18 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)Alternatives to phthalatesThe hazardous properties of BPA and those of some of its alternatives have been reviewed in se- veral studies.21 23 The substitution of BPA can be done by replacing BPA with chemical alternatives or by substituting the plastic polymer with another plastic polymer or material. Other bisphenols have been indicated as potential substitutes for BPA. This is the case for bisphenol S, bisphenol F and bisphenol AP. However, existing data shows that due to their similar structure they can have similar or even worse health effects than BPA.21 85 86 87 Therefore, when evaluating the safety of compounds for consumer use, it may be prudent to consider entire classes instead of individual com- pounds.88 The SCENIHR report on BPA in medical devices made only a brief overall note of existing studies on both bisphenol S and bisphenol F toxicity.23 One common conclusion from all the reviews is that because BPA is used ubiquitously, there is no sin- gle replacement for all industrial solutions. Known alternatives to BPA or to the plastic polymer con-taining BPA that are used in medical devices inclu- de many of the alternatives for phthalates such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, silicone and acetylo-nitrile-butadiene-styrene. Other com- mon replacements include ceramic, stainless steel, glass and acrylic. The information available for the alternatives to BPA in medical devices is considerably less than that existing for phthalate alternatives. More specific BPA alternatives have only appeared more recently and information about them is much more sparse and the data gaps much larger. Manufacturers al- ready replacing BPA in their medical devices inclu- de Didactic89, Technoflex90, Mamivac, Nipro Europe. Tables summarising the applications, advantages, disadvantages, toxicity and main knowledge gaps of possible alternatives to BPA in medical devices were printed in the previous edition of Non-toxic Healthcare report76. These have been moved to the Safer Medical Devices Database (safermedicaldevi - ces.org) with the intention to keep them updated as and when appropriate evidence becomes available.CHAPTER 3 Healthcare facilities and professionals play an im- portant role in the substitution of hazardous che- micals. They have both an ethical responsibility to use products that are less hazardous for patients and the purchasing power to push manufacturers towards safer and lower impact products. In Euro- pe, public procurement of goods accounts for 16% of the total European market.91 Hospitals throughout Europe are working to mini- mise the exposure of their patients to hazardous chemicals. The first step of many hospitals has been to identify which products contain substan - ces of concern and develop an internal substitution strategy or policy. Many have launched substitution projects, particularly targeting DEHP and PVC in medical devices. These strategies and policies help hospitals in their purchasing decisions. HCWH Europe's factsheet PVC/DEHP phase-out is possible anywhere in Europe: Model hospitals show how to succeed , shows that already in 2007, hos- pitals across Europe (Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Czech Republic, Slovakia, France, Italy, the Nether- lands) were phasing out PVC medical devices in or- der to protect patients from DEHP and other alter- native plasticisers.92 In 2008, HCWH published a report with information, examples, and guidance for healthcare facilities to improve their purchasing decisions regarding che- micals - Guide to Choosing Safer Products and Chemi- cals: Implementing Chemicals Policy in Health Care.93 In 2018, HCWH Europe published Guidelines for the procurement of safer medical devices .94 In the 2014 edition of this report, HCWH Europe collated information on best practices in Euro- pean hospitals and approaches towards non-toxic healthcare (HCWH 2014). Initiatives taken by the Hospital of Southern Jutland (Denmark), Stockholm County Council (Sweden), the Westfriesgasthuis Hospital (The Netherlands), the Vienna Hospitals Association (Austria) were described. Only new information has been included in 2019 update.CHAPTER 4 Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices PVC-free initiative of Helsinki University Hospital (Finland) One of the environmental objectives at Helsinki Uni- versity Hospital (HUS) is responsible procurement, taking into consideration important ecological and social aspects and giving priority to products that are considered more sustainable. Medical gloves are a product's group completely PVC-free now. HUS aims to radically reduce the use of PVC in all product groups by the end of 2020, where replace- ment is possible, particularly medical tubing, which conventionally contains PVC.95 PVC-free tubing has already been requested in procurement specifica- tions.96 How hospital districts in Finland are ta - king steps to reduce the use of PVC KEINO Competence Centre for sustainable and innovative public procurement (https://www.han- kintakeino.fi/en) and HUS invited hospital districts to a meeting in March 2019, to create a vision of a responsible procurement.97 98 During this meeting, hospitals presented a range of different sustainable procurement objectives. Among these, the reduc- tion of PVC use received a lot of support.98 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 21 20 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)Alternatives to BPA Best practices in European healthcareThe increased global focus on plastics can be ex- plained by the growing awareness of the environ- mental consequences of plastics production and consumption, particularly in relation to plastic was- te generation. The human dependence on plastics in everyday life is reflected in its ubiquitous presen- ce as litter in the environment. Plastic pollution has drawn significant attention from the media, the public, and scientists span- ning diverse fields, including polymer science, eco- logy, and toxicology. To date the impacts of plastic have been primarily studied within marine environ- ments99, and whilst plastic contamination was first reported on nearly 50 years ago, the United Nati- ons Environment Programme only identified plastic debris in the ocean as an emerging issue in 2011.100 More recently, microplastics in freshwater101 and terrestrial102 environments has been become an emerging concern. There is also a new research exploring the impact of plastics on antimicrobial re- sistance.103 104 Single-use plastics and plastic packaging present a substantial part of this problem. Short-term use with long-term environmental consequences, with most plastic waste currently disposed of in landfills or incinerated. Plastics and the chemicals used in their manufacture now contaminate our soils, ri- vers, oceans, air, and increasingly our food supply. This significant societal challenge has stimulated research on plastic uses and its impacts on human health.105 This chapter discusses the state of understanding of medical plastics used in healthcare and their im- pact on health. We aim to present a picture about how plastics are being used in healthcare and the effects of plastics on human health, from produc- tion through to end-of-life. We also ask whether it is possible to reduce plastic use and plastic waste in the healthcare sector and what healthcare insti- tutions are doing to address this emerging global challenge.CHAPTER 5 risation or recycling). Additives can also be used for specific properties defining their application (e.g. hardness, softness, resistance to ultraviolet light, flame formation resistance). A joint project by ECHA and the plastics industry listed over 400 functional additives or pigments currently used in plastics, in- cluding information on the polymers they are most commonly found in and the typical concentration ranges.111Table 2. Two main categories of polymers.110 115 Thermoplastics can be melted and hardened reversiblyThermosets un- dergo a chemical change during hea - ting - they cannot be re-melted and reformed) Common exam - ples Polyethylene te - rephthalate (PET) Polypropylene (PP) Polystyrene (PS) Polyethylene (PE) Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) FluoropolymersCommon exam - ples Polyurethane (PUR) Epoxy resins Unsaturated poly - ester Acrylic resins Silicone Vinyl ester Plastic production and pollution Plastics are used almost everywhere. It has been estimated that a total of 8,300 million metric tonnes of virgin plastic has been produced globally so far, of which only 30% of it is still in use.116 In 2017, glo- bal plastic production reached 348 million tonnes, of which 64.4 million tonnes was in Europe (EU28, Norway, and Switzerland). Packaging and building/ construction accounted for 39.7% and 19.8% of the total plastics respectively, whilst 16.7% of the total plastics produced in 2017 were used to produce medical equipment together with other non-medi - cal uses, such as furniture and technical parts used for mechanical engineering.115 High production volumes of plastic and high de- mand have led to the global problem of plastic pol- lution in the environment. In 2015, there was 6,300 million metric tonnes of plastic waste produced, of which only 9% was recycled.116 With regards to plas- tic packaging, 95% of material value is estimated to be lost (not recycled).117 Globally, plastic production and plastic incineration is estimated to produce 400 BOX 9 Main types of plastics Oxo-degradable plastics include additives which, through oxidation, lead to fragmenta - tion into micro-fragments or to chemical de- composition.106 Biodegradable plastics are capable of decom- posing physically and biologically, ultimately into carbon dioxide (CO2), biomass, and water. In accordance with European standards for pa- ckaging, these plastics are recoverable through composting and anaerobic digestion.106 Bioplastics: (also known as biopolymers) are made from renewable plant feedstocks (e.g. corn, sugar beet, or sugar cane). Bioplastics can consist of mixtures including other plas- tic(s) and are not necessarily biodegradable; however, they do generally present a lower risk to the environment in comparison to con- ventional plastic.105 Polylactic acid (PLA), plant- derived polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) are all bioplastics. Microplastics are not a specific kind of plas- tic but rather any type of plastic solid partic- le smaller than 5mm112. Particles smaller than 0.1mm are defined as nanoplastics113. Primary microplastics are materials deliberately desig- ned and manufactured to be of small size (e.g. cosmetic microbeads), while secondary micro- plastics are unintentionally formed through the wear and tear of larger pieces of plastic, including synthetic textiles, that have undergo- ne fragmentation and weathering, during their use or disposition in the environment.114General background What are plastics? In the EU, plastic is defined as \"a material consisting of a polymer as defined in point 5 of Article 3 of Re- gulation (EC) No 1907/2006, to which additives or ot- her substances may have been added, and which can function as a main structural component of final pro- ducts, with the exception of natural polymers that have not been chemically modified\".106 It is important to understand that plastics are not a single, specific material, although they are often re- ferred to as such. Plastics are a large family of che- micals, composed of a great variety of materials de- signed to meet thousands of very different needs and applications. Over 5,300 polymer formulations are commercially available107 and more than 4,000 known chemicals are associated with plastic packa- ging alone.108 In principle, plastics can be develo- ped with virtually any combination of properties to accommodate almost any application. Plastics are therefore increasingly being used in diverse appli- cations such as packaging, building and construc- tion, mobility and transport, electronics, agriculture, healthcare, sport and leisure, and energy.109 Plastics are chains of molecules (monomers) lin- ked together in chains called polymers. The vast majority of plastics are composed of polymers of carbon and hydrogen, either alone or with oxy- gen, nitrogen, chlorine, fluorine or sulphur.110 Tho- se polymers follow a different production process (e.g. condensation and cross-linking), have different chemical structure (e.g. acrylics, polyesters, polyole- fins, silicones, polyurethanes and halogenated plas- tics), and all have different properties, which make it impractical for different polymers to be recycled together. Generally speaking, plastics can be divi- ded into four key groups: oxo-degradable plastics, biodegradable plastics, bioplastics, and microplas- tics (see Box 9). In addition, two main categories of polymers can be clearly distinguished: thermoplas - tics and thermosets (see Table 2). Plastics can contain various additives to improve their behaviour during manufacturing (lubricants, catalysts, stabilisers, solvents, and aids for polyme- NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 23 22 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)The health impacts of plastics in healthcaremillion tonnes of CO2 a year.118 In Europe, 41.6% of collected plastic (27.1 million tonnes) is used for energy recovery whilst 27.3% ends up in landfill.115 The remaining 31.1% of plastic waste is recycled with 63% of recycling occurring in the EU.115 It is important to recognise that the global trade in waste plastics has seen the movement of significant volumes of plastic waste from developed countries to developing countries, where environmentally un- sound recycling and disposal practices can exacer- bate exposure to toxic compounds. China's decisi- on to ban the import of contaminated plastic waste is predicted to result in the displacement of 111 million metric tonnes of plastic waste by 2030.119 In 2019, human exposure to persistent organic pollutants due to poor management of imported plastics was noted in Ghana with sampling at a 're- cycling site' revealing some of the highest levels of dioxins ever recorded.120 Plastics can enter marine, freshwater, and terres- trial environments, reaching air, soils, rivers and lakes.105 It has been estimated that there are 5.25 trillion particles of plastics in the oceans globally, weighing 268,940 tonnes.121 Of the plastic debris detected in the western North Pacific Ocean 89% came from single-use plastic items.122 In the EU, 80- 85% of marine litter plastic, half of which is single- use plastic. Within the EU, 75,000 - 300,000 tonnes of microplastics end up in the environment annual - ly118, and a 2019 study suggested that atmospheric transportation and deposition of microplastics is contributing to the contamination.123 Single-use plastics are a growing problem, yet whilst biodegradable and compostable plastics were de- signed as a potential solution, these plastics also pose problems to ecosystems.124 Despite the fact that huge amounts of polymers are produced, imported, and used in Europe and there is wide expose, companies currently have no ob- ligation to register these chemicals and therefore provide information on their health and environ- mental hazards. At the time of the REACH regula- tion's adoption in 2007, polymers were considered to be less hazardous than monomers and were therefore exempted. Global initiatives related to mitigation of plastics impact on the environment As the global use of plastics rises, so too do initia- tives to mitigate the environmental and health im- pacts of plastics. Global conventions to tackle plas- tic pollution have been suggested by the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) and their partners125, and Adelphi.126 The United Nations Environment Programme's Glo- bal Plastic Platform, launched in September 2018, seeks to reduce plastic pollution through new com- mitments. The network also promotes the transi- tion to a circular economy in which design, pro- duction, consumption and disposal of plastics are taken into account.127 In October 2018, the New Plastics Economy Glo- bal Commitment was launched, led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation128. As of 2019 this has over 400 signatories including businesses and govern- ments.129 The World Economic Forum (WEF) also launched a platform in 2018 for public-private actions towards a circular economy130, which includes plastics. The partnership's ambition is to prevent plastic pollu- tion reaching the sea by 2025.130 As China reduced imports of nearly a million tons of mixed plastic waste in 2018, waste-exporting na- tions turned to South East Asian countries, which soon became overwhelmed. In May 2019, world go- vernments supported developing countries to refu- se toxic mixed plastic waste shipments through the UN Basel Convention.131 The majority of the world's governments created new regulations requiring waste exporters to declare the content of mixed waste shipments and enable receiving countries to refuse plastic waste imports. The European legal framework The European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Eco- nomy In December 2015, the European Commission ad- opted an EU action plan for the Circular Economy and identified plastics as a priority area. The action plan stated that plastic recycling is necessary in a circular economy.132 In January 2018, the European Commission relea- sed the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy118, which lays out the vision for Europe's new plastics economy. Under the strategy key play- ers should improve the design of plastic products so that at least 50% of plastic waste is recycled by 2030. Modernising and developing markets for recycled products should also be addressed.124 EU Directive (2018/852) on packaging and packaging waste In July 2018, the revised legislative framework on waste entered into force setting recycling rate tar- gets for plastic in packaging waste: 65% by 2025 and 70% by 2030.133 EU Directive (2019/904) on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment In June 2019, the European Commission adopted a Directive on the reduction of the impact of cer- tain plastic products on the environment.134 The Directive lays down market restrictions of single- use plastic products, as well oxo-degradable plastic products, including cotton bud sticks, straws, and food and beverage containers made of expanded polystyrene. Restriction under consideration: Microplastics ECHA has prepared an Annex XV restriction re- port135 on the use of intentionally added microplas- tic particles in consumer or professional use pro- ducts.136 The public consultation on microplastics ran until 20 September 2019.137 Industry initiatives Globally, industry efforts are only focussing on end- of-life plastics, increasing the use of recycled con- tent with the intention of keeping materials in the value chain longer. In practice, this means that ma- terials are being recycled that were never optimised for human and environmental health.138 Polymeric materials such as foam, plastic food packaging and textiles for example can contain flame-retardants, plasticisers, coatings, modifiers, catalysts, and other performance enhancing additives and residuals. When recycled into new products, the output tends to be non-homogeneous and highly contaminated, and therefore not suitable for use in toys, food con- tact materials, and other applications.138 Voluntary actions from the European plastics in- dustry also focus only on recycling and reusing of plastics.139 Whilst important components of working towards a circular economy, other aspects, such as reduction of plastics use (and single-use plastic in particular), and 'detoxification' of plastics need to be addressed as well. The Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW), compri- sing over 35 global companies from different parts of the plastics value chain, has a mission is to \"elimi- nate plastic waste in the environment\".140 Crucially, however, the reduction of single-use plastic is not to be found in the AEPW plans. The Circular Plastics Alliance was launched in De- cember 2018, bringing together public and private stakeholders from the plastics value chain. The all- iance's target is to annually re-use 10 million tonnes of recycled plastics in products and packaging by 2025.141 The declaration of the alliance was adop- ted on 20 September 2019, with more than 100 signatories.141 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 25 24 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)Impact of plastics on human health The presence of toxic or potentially toxic substan - ces in plastic products has a negative impact on the environment and human health, and affects all pha- ses of the life cycle of plastic products. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are used as additives in a large volume of plastic polymers.138 Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (SCCPs) used in PVC and ethy- lene-vinyl acetate (EVA), for example, have already been listed under the Stockholm Convention. Seve- ral other chemicals (e.g., cadmium, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are also used as additives or found as contaminants in plastics. Evidence concerning the health risks posed by plas- tics is mounting. It is important to recognise that plastics can cause risks to human health during their whole lifecycle, through the different expo- sure routes: inhalation, ingestion, and contact with skin. Challenges of the life cycle management of plastics and their impact on health have been re- cently addressed in detail by Center for Internatio - nal Environmental Law.105 Human exposure during the extraction and trans - portation of fossil feedstock required for producing plastic can be linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, and reproductive and developmental toxicity. During the refinement and production of plastic resins and additives, impairment of the nervous system, leuk- aemia, and low birth weight have been reported. In- cineration, co-incineration, gasification, and pyroly- sis cause toxic chemicals to be released into the air, water, and soils. These releases can cause cancers, as well as neurological and immune damage. Du- ring use, consumers can ingest and inhale micro- plastics together with other toxic substances (such as additives), which can potentially cause cancers, diabetes, and developmental toxicity.105 The review of known plastic-associated chemicals and their hazards concluded that of the 906 chemi- cals likely associated with plastic packaging, 63 rank highest for human health hazards and 68 for en- vironmental hazards according to the harmonised hazard classifications assigned by the European Chemicals Agency within the Classification, Label- ling and Packaging (CLP).142 Further, 7 of the 906 substances are classified in the European Union as persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT), or very persistent, very bioaccumulative (vPvB), and 15 as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC). Of the 906 chemicals, 34 are also recognised as EDC or poten- tial EDC in the recent EDC report by the United Nati- ons Environment Programme. The identified hazar - dous chemicals are used in plastic-associated chemicals are not covalent - ly bound to the polymer, so they can be released at all stages of the plastics' lifecycle via migration to liquids or solids or via volatilisation. This can result in a transfer of chemicals from products/packaging to consumer e.g. via food. A recent comprehensive scientific study on the toxicity of chemicals present in plastic products confirmed toxicity of complex chemical content.143 Researchers analysed 34 wide- ly used consumer products made from plastics, in- cluding products coming in contact with food such as refillable water bottles and food wraps. This ana - lysis covers eight major polymer types: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane (PUR), polyethylene terephthalate sity polyethylene (LDPE) and polylactic acid (PLA). Researchers found toxic compounds in a majority of the plastic extracts and proposed a prioritisation of chemicals entering into their composition accor- ding to their toxicity.Findings showed that143: l 74% of the plastic extracts contained chemicals triggering at least one endpoint relevant for as- sessing health impacts l Plastics contain large mixtures of chemicals - many of those are unknown and difficult to identify. l Out of 260 chemicals tentatively identified (in- cluding monomers, additives, and non-inten - tionally added substances,) 27 of were priori - tised based on high in vitro toxicity, including well-known additives such as benzophenones, butylated hydroxytoluene or triethyl phospha- te, as well as less known isomers such as deca- noic acid. l Extracts of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and poly- urethane (PUR) were observed to induce the highest toxicity at most endpoints from the eight polymer types investigated. l All \"bioplastics\" made of polylactic acid (PLA) were also observed to be of toxicity levels simi- lar to that of PVC and PUR. l The toxicities of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polystyrene (PS), and polypropylene (PP) varied depending on the endpoint measu - red. Compared with chemicals used in plastics, even less is known about the toxic effects of plastic par- ticles in the human body.144 A scientific literature review on health impacts and human exposure to plastic through diet and inhalation revealed that microplastics might accumulate and exert localised particle toxicity by inducing or enhancing an immu- ne response.145 If inhaled or ingested, chemical to- xicity could occur due to the localised leaching of component monomers, endogenous additives, and adsorbed environmental pollutants. Chronic exposure is anticipated to be of greater concern due to the accumulative effect that could occur. This is expected to be dose-dependent but a robust evidence-base of exposure levels is current- ly lacking.145 A literature review by Smith et al. (2018) focused on exposure to microplastics through seafood and the potential implications for human health. The authors concluded that the toxicity as- sociated with consuming microplastics is likely de-pendent on size, associated chemicals, and dose. As with the previous study, recommendations for future research are provided.146 In general, micro- plastics to which human are exposed via different routes can potentially cause inflammation, genoto - xicity, oxidative stress and cell necrosis, and over time, these effects could also lead to tissue dama- ge, fibrosis, and cancer.105 A 2019 report by Science Advice for Policy by Euro- pean Academies: Scientific Perspective on Microplas- tics in Nature and Society113 and the report from the World Health Organization Microplastics in drinking water114 concluded that, based on the information currently available, there are no emerging health concerns relating to microplastics. However, both reports outline that further research is needed. Particularly worrying is fact that that plastic par- ticles and plastic associated chemicals are found almost in every human studied. Recent reports suggest that microplastics are entering the human body through drinking water, food, and air. A 2018 study from the Medical University of Vienna and the Environment Agency of Austria analysed stool sam - ples from participants across eight countries and found microplastics and up to nine different types of plastic resins in every sample tested.147 Another study showed alarming levels of plastic in children's bodies. According to a study by the Ger- man Environment Ministry and the Robert Koch Institute, plastic by-products were found in 97% of blood and urine samples from 2,500 children tes- ted between 2014 and 2017.148 Younger children were reported to be the most affected by plastic in- gestion. The study has not yet been published, and the results were made available by the government upon request by a Green Party inquiry into the ef- fects of chemicals on public health.148 It should be broadly understood that toxic additives need to be substituted with non-chemical alterna - tives or non-toxic substances to reduce human ex- posure, as well as to make recycling easier.138 Currently ZonMw, the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development, coordinates 15 short-term projects investigating the effects of micro- and nanoplastics on human health, and fo- cusing in particular on uptake via ingestion and in- halation and effects of, potential translocation to brain and placenta, and potential effects on immu - ne system.149 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 27 26 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)63 rank highest for human health hazards 68 rank highest for environmental hazards according to the harmonised hazard classifications assigned by the European Chemicals Agency within the Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) 7 of the 906 substances are classified in the European Union as persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT), or very persistent, very bioaccu - mulative (vPvB) 15 substances are classified as endocrine dis - rupting chemicals (EDC). 34 substances are recognized as EDC or potential EDC in the recent EDC report by the United Nations Environment Programme 906 chemicals likely associated with plastic packaging 200 300The review of known plastic-associated chemicals and their hazard concluded that: 142 Plastics in healthcare - Medical plastics The market in plastic medical devices and pharma - ceutical packaging continues to grow. A key bene- fit in medicine and public health is the versatility of these materials which, when combined with an extremely low cost, has enabled the mass produc- tion of disposable single-use health care products that are both functional and hygienic. The industry points out that modern healthcare would be im- possible without many plastic-based medical pro- ducts.150 151 Fibres and resins used in medical applications in- clude polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) as well as nylon, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide (PA), polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile butadiene (ABS), polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyurethane (PU). The most widely used plastic material in me- dical applications is PVC followed by PE, PP, PS and PET. PVC is most widely used in pre-sterilised sing- le-use medical applications.151 Traditionally, metals, glass and ceramics were used for medical implants, devices and supports. Ho- wever, polymers are often better suited to certain applications as they offer lighter weight and bet- ter biocompatibility. Plastics are for example key components of modern prosthetic devices offering greater flexibility, comfort and trouble-free mobility. Plastic packaging, with its excellent barrier proper- ties, lightweight, low cost, durability, and transparen- cy, is particularly suitable for medical applications. Today, medical plastics are everywhere, from exa- mination gloves to sterile syringes and IV tubes or heart valves. There is also an array of plastic dispo- sable medical products in use, including bed pans, insulin pens, IV tubes, tube fittings, plastic cups and pitchers, eye patches, surgical and examination glo- ves, inflatable splints, inhalation masks, tubing for dialysis, disposable gowns, wipes and droppers, uri- ne continence and ostomy products. Importantly, innovations in plastics are making more and more new procedures possible. Plastics are now being used as orthopaedic devices, whe- re they align, support or correct deformities. Thin tubes called catheters are used to unblock blood vessels. Synthetic material also plays a vital role for diseased arteries that cannot be helped via vessel support, whereby the affected section of the aorta is removed and the gap bridged by a flexible plas- tic prosthesis. Artificial corneas made from special silicone, flexible and made of biomechanics similar to a natural cornea can restore clear vision again.151Modern healthcare uses many plastic-based me- dical products to provide high quality treatments and solutions. However, this exerts pressure on en- vironment throughout the supply chain, which in- cludes plastic packaging, single-use products made of different (often mixed) plastics and materials fre- quently containing hazardous chemicals. Plastics used in healthcare therefore pose a direct risk to patients and staff, and produces a significant volu- me of waste, which contributes to wider environ- mental harm. There has been a gradual transformation from re- useable non-plastic to disposable plastic products in healthcare over the last 30 years, with most com- mon arguments for this transition being an increa- sed focus on infection prevention and control and cost effectiveness.152 It remains unclear whether what is required is more effective sterilisation pro- cedures, rather than disposable equipment. Use of re-useable devices can often reduce costs in the long run, as well as reducing packaging and clinical waste.152 Further evidence in the form of whole-li- fe costing calculations undertaken during procure- ment exercises is required. In the study of Minoglou et al. (2017)153 healthcare waste generation rates (kg/bed/day) of Euro- are presented: lands: France 3.3, Germany and Greece: 3.6, Norway: 3.9, Italy: 4, and Spain: 4.4. Overall, plastic waste generation in the EU in 2016 reached 17,590,000 tonnes, and healthcare and biological waste generation was 2,020,000 tonnes.iiv Plastic use and waste disposal varies across he- althcare providers in Europe and there is a lack of precise data showing the extent of medical and non- medical plastics use and volumes of waste. Where evidence has been gathered, the need for transfor- mative action is clear. The UK's National Health Ser- vice, for example, recovers only about 5% of plastic waste and pays to dispose of 133,000 tonnes of plas- tic each year, significantly contributing to its \u00a3700m annual waste disposal bill.154 Whilst general public awareness of plastics' harmful impacts is increasing in Europe, the healthcare sector is largely unaware of the impacts from its own plastic consumption and how to go about reducing this. Recent studies have challenged received wisdom concerning the use of single-use plastics in infection prevention and cont- rol, and demonstrate the potential to reduce, reuse, and recycle at a much higher rate.152 The Healthcare Plastics Recycling Council has pre- pared a guidance document to inform and educate iv Eurostat. (2019) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/home? plastics recyclers and processors about the com- mon streams of plastic waste (see Box 10) generated in clinical settings.155 Impacts of medical plastics In the previous chapters of this report, the focus has been on plastic medical devices containing phthalates and BPA and the possible risks they pose to patients during medical treatments. This chapter outlines how toxic chemicals are genera - ted throughout the lifecycle of plastic medical pro- ducts, for example, dioxins generated during PVC production and disposal, which can also pose a risk to human health. Although beyond the scope of this report, it is im- portant to emphasise that the use of plastics in he- althcare is not limited to medical devices and other medical products. Electronics, upholstered furnitu - re, cups and cutlery used in the staff canteen, and PVC coverings in hospitals are entirely or partially made from plastic materials.156 157 158 Medical plastics comprise a diverse and heteroge - neous group of polymers and each product has an individual and complex chemical composition (i.e. one or more polymers, multiple additives such as plasticisers, flame retardants, stabilisers, antioxi- dants - for examples see Box 11). Unfortunately, due to a lack of full transparency in the supply chain and incompleteness of publicly available informa - tion on both the use and amount of numerous sub- stances in medical plastics, our knowledge is cur- rently limited. While hazard, exposure and epidemiological data on a small number of prominent plastic-associated chemicals such as DEHP and BPA is abundant and growing, it remains challenging to form a true as- sessment of the chemical safety of medical plastics, despite this being an important source of patient exposure. At the same time, the breadth of re- search identifying negative human health impacts of many of the plastic additives present in widely used consumer products is conclusive that there BOX 10 The most common recyclable health - care plastic waste streams155: l Polypropylene (PP) (product: sterilisation wraps which are used for surgical instru- ments to prevent contamination) l Homo-polymer PP (product: containers such as pitchers, basins, and cups) l Polypropylene (PP) or high-density poly- ethylene Polyethylene glycol (PETG) or high impact polystyrene (HIPS) (pro- duct: trays) l Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or high- density polyethylene such as Non-Woven and Film Plas- tics)BOX 11 Some examples of devices / additives used in healthcare l PVC medical devices/ Plasticisers: DEHP51 sutures/ Co- lour - um and medical textiles whe- re PTFE is used: PFOA as impurity from manufacturing162 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 29 28 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)are significant risks to human health and a precau- tionary approach is warranted.105 This section describes emerging groups of chemi- cals used in plastic production due to their known impacts on human health. It deals with groups of chemicals rather than individual substances, in or- der to focus on the reduction in the use of entire classes rather than the phasing out of individual problematic chemicals one at a time. Such an ap- proach helps develop coordinated strategies for reducing the production and use of chemicals of concern and prevents regrettable substitutions. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) PFASs contain a wide group of substances164 of which a significant amount have no CAS number (the unique reference number that allows chemical substances to be identified).165 It has been estima - ted that there are nearly 5,000 types of PFAS in the global market with plenty different applications.166 Unfortunately, applications within the healthcare sector are much less well known (see Box 13).165BOX 13 Examples of healthcare applications of PFAS162 165 167 168 l Dental restorative material l Medical devices (e.g. sensors, cardiovascu- lar devices, vascular catheters, protection tubing, implants and orthopaedic devices) l Invasive medical devices (e.g. guide wires, balloon catheters and introducer sheets) l Radiopaque catheters (e.g. catheters for angiography and indwelling needle cathe - ters) l Medical textiles (e.g. surgical gowns and drapes, masks and caps, medical implants, surgical patches) Exposure to PFASs has been associated with hepa- tic, cardiovascular, endocrine, immune, reproducti- ve, and developmental effects.169 One recent study showed that exposure to eight PFAS compounds was associated with altered kidney and thyroid functioning.170 The most known PFASs are perfluo- rooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfo - nic acid (PFOS), extremely persistent (also called 'forever chemicals') and toxic chemicals that beca- me also global contaminants.171 PFOS, PFOA and related substances are included in the Stockholm Convention. A considerable number of adverse health effects have been linked with PFOA exposure in humans: in- creased cholesterol levels, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, cancers, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and reduced birth weight.172 Strong evidence has been found in toxicology and epidemiology studies that humans exposed to PFOA and PFOS are at risk for immunosuppression.173 A literature review sum - marised the epidemiological evidence for the influ- ence that pre- and postnatal exposures to PFASs may have on health outcomes in offspring, with a particular focus on birth outcomes and postnatal growth, immunomodulatory effects and neurode- velopment.174 Studies on health impacts in children found associations with PFAS exposure and dysli- pidemia, vaccine response asthma, renal function, and the onset of menstruation.175 The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) recent-ly set the provisional tolerable weekly intakes for PFOA at 6 nanograms (ng) per kilogram of body weight, lowering it from 1,500 ng daily - a clear acknowledgement that these chemicals are much more damaging to human health than previously thought. A large portion of the EU population alrea- dy exceeds these new safety levels.172 Flame-retardants There are many different types of flame retar- dants, which are used to protect products from burning. In the healthcare sector, polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) are used most diphe- nyl ethers (PCDEs). Halogenated phosphate flame retardants were reported in some applications as well. The PBDEs family contains 209 substances, which are termed congeners. Each is a mixture of brominated substances.176 Because of their toxicity and persistence, the industrial production of some PBDEs (decaBDE, hexaBDE, heptaBDE, tetraBDE, pentaBDE,) is restricted under the Stockholm Con- vention).177 178 179 To date, PBDEs impacts on human health is limi- ted, as most studies have been conducted on an- imals.176 The impact of PBDEs on developing ner- vous and reproductive system, developing and mature endocrine system, and the liver and the male reproductive system, have raised concerns in animal studies.176 PBDEs have been shown to have hormone-disrupting effects, in particular, on oestrogen and thyroid hormones.180 The studies have shown that even a single dose administered to rat during development of the brain can cause permanent changes in behaviour of offspring and permanently impaired spermatogenesis.181 The health hazards of PBDEs have attracted in- creasing scrutiny, and have been shown to reduce fertility in humans at levels found in typical house - holds.182 The studies in humans found effects of (PBDEs) on thyroid regulation during pregnancy183, neurodevelopment effects184, and behavioural velopment in children.185 Moreover, it has been re- ported that memory domains in early adolescence can be affected following prenatal and postnatal exposure to PBDEs.186 Some epidemiological re- sults indicate that PBDEs could act as developmen- tal neurotoxicants.187 In general, more research, in particular epidemiology studies, is needed to obtain greater support for associations between PBDEs and certain health impacts in humans. Recently, the phosphate flame retardant (PFR) me- tabolites were found in urine samples from patients Convention, a treaty to control and phase out major persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Flame-retardants Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are organobromine compounds that are used as flame-retardants. They are structurally similar to the PCBs and other polyhalogenated com- pounds, consisting of two halogenated aro- matic rings. PBDEs are classified according to the average number of bromine atoms in the molecule. Since the 1990s, environmental con- cerns were raised because of the high hydro- phobicity of PBDEs and their high resistance to degradation processes. Swedish scientists first reported substances related to pentaBDE were accumulating in human breast milk.163 Halogenated phosphate flame retardant, Tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) Phosphate (TDCPP) and its blends are used as flame-retardants in the manufacture of polyurethane foam.BOX 12 Perflourinated chemicals Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are group of man-made chemicals that includes PFOA, PFOS, GenX, and many other chemicals. PFAS have been manufactured and used in a variety of industries around the globe, inclu- ding in the United States since the 1940s. The widespread use of PFAS and their ability to remain intact in the environment means that over time PFAS levels from past and current uses can result in increasing levels of environ- mental contamination. PFOA and PFOS have been the most extensi - vely produced and studied of these chemicals. Both chemicals are persistent, bioaccumulati- ve, and toxic substances (PBT). Due to these properties it may cause severe and irreversi- ble adverse effects on the environment and human health. PFOA and a number of PFOA- related substances are found throughout the environment, including remote areas, since they can be transported over long distances via water and air. Based on their PBT and CMR properties, PFOA and its salt (APFO) have been identified as substances of very high concern (SVHC) under REACH. Certain PFAS chemicals are no longer manufactured in the United States as a result of phase-outs including the PFOA Stewardship Program in which eight ma- jor chemical manufacturers agreed to elimina - te the use of PFOA and PFOA-related chemi- cals in their products and as emissions from their facilities. Currently, the use of both PFOS and PFOA is restricted under the Stockholm \u00ea NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 31 30 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)\u00eain intensive care unit the levels of the metabolites were higher in urine samples from intensive care unit (ICU) patients in comparison to urine samples from the control group.159 The results of this study are preliminary (there are no previous studies), but as the highest PFRs levels were found in patients that were in con- tact with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and extracorporeal membrane that PFRs are ori- ginating from indwelling medical devices used in the ICU.159 Further research into the possible toxic effects of these chemicals released from medical devices is urgently needed. Case studies of plastic waste management in European hospitals The following examples describe initiatives already being undertaken to address many plastic material streams in European healthcare providers. Aarhus University Hospital (Denmark) Aarhus University Hospital (AUH) is investigating new approaches to manage plastic packaging was- te through increased recycling and circular econo- my of plastic packaging.188 Through collaboration with industry, focus is put on the development and testing of a value chain model for the creation of environmental and commercial values out of hospi- tal plastic packaging waste.188 189 Preliminary recom- mendations are as follows188: reduce the number of polymers; prioritise use of recyclable polymers, and consider recycling of resources in the design of packaging. Helsinki University Hospital (HUS, Finland) In 2018, waste prevention was addressed in a new group of HUS called Ekologinen ATeK. This group is working towards an operating room model, which is as environmentally sustainable as possible, in dif- ferent areas of activity.96 In a press release in June 2019190, HUS highlighted that most of its plastic waste originates from ope- rating rooms dealing with musculoskeletal surgery. This is because all of the equipment used is packa- ged separately (including individual screws). At the outset, the difficulties in sorting plastics were related to insufficient or unclear labelling on packa- ging.190 The plastics are currently sorted into three containers depending on the following plastic ty- pes: PET-plastic 01, PE-LD-plastic 04, PE-HD-plastic Hospital of Leuven (UZ Leuven, Belgium) Every year Belgian hospitals throw away millions of baby feeding bottles after a single use, creating more than 300 tonnes of high-quality plastic ma- terial which are then incinerated. Sirris, a Belgian non-profit organisation, together with a working group of interested parties, started the 'Baby Bottle Reborn' pilot project in 2013 at the University Hos- pital of Leuven (UZ Leuven).191 The project aimed to recycle this material stream by identifying and solving the legal, technical and logistical obstacles in the way. The result is that the disposable bottles are now sorted at the hospital before being recyc- led into new raw materials. From the experiences gathered in this project, it is hoped that the project can be rolled out to other hospitals.192 Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis Hospital in Ams- terdam (OLVG, The Netherlands) An analysis of the plastic waste stream from OVLG hospital in Amsterdam was conducted by the social enterprise, Circle Economy193 as part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment's Ne- derland Circulair initiative.194 The analysis of nine bags from OVLG's operating room was performed, and concluded that disposables packaging makes up over 50% of plastic waste, and is composed of nearly 15 different types of plastic materials.195 The largest estimated plastic type used in disposables packaging based on weight were Polypropylene (PP), followed by Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Mixed High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) with Coa- ted Medical Grade Paper, and Polyvinyl chloride (PVC).195 In addition, 45% of plastic products were not labelled and nearly 20% of the plastic waste was composed of mixed materials either (different kinds of plastic or plastic combined with other ma- terials such as paper and aluminium).195 Initiatives from the medical devices industry Halyard Health has developed a BLUE RENEW* Sterilization Wrap Recycling Program. The program started in 2010 with the aim of helping healthcare facilities recycle the HALYARD* Sterilization Wrap used in operating rooms. The wrap consists of poly- propylene fabric, which is recyclable. In North Ame- rica there are now nearly 300 healthcare facilities, which together prevent 4 million pounds of wrap ending up in landfills.196 In Australia and New Zealand, Kimberley-Clark has initiated a KIMGUARD* Sterile Wrap recycling pro- gram together with SITA-MediCollect. Used, clean, and uncontaminated KIMGUARD* Sterile Wrap products are collected by SITA MediCollect, which recycles the products into polypropylene pellets. These pellets are then used to make buckets, rain drains and corrugated packaging.197PVCMed Alliance (The European Council of Vinyl Manufacturers) describes challenges and oppor- tunities of PVC plastic recycling in hospitals.198 PVC Recycling in Hospitals estimates that PVC-based medical products are estimated to represent about one-quarter of all plastic waste.199 PVCMed states that medical-grade PVC is a high-quality compound that can be recycled into many new soft PVC appli- cations, however, the presence of DEHP plasticiser may compromise recycling. This will become less of an issue as the use of DEHP is phased out. Current- ly, in the UK, more than 10 hospitals are part of the RecoMed scheme200, funded by the European PVC industry's sustainable development programme Vi- nylPlus\u00ae.201 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 33 32 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)The way forward / The urgency to act on plastics \"Use of plastic goods in the healthcare sector has beco- me 'epidemic' and most of it is being used in the name of low cost and patient safety\".152 Plastics, plasticisers, and other additives to poly- mers are ubiquitous in modern society, however, their increasing use causes environmental harm and poses a clear and defined risk to human health. In the healthcare sector, plastics are used in medi- cal devices and other medical applications because they fulfil number of specific performance and sa- fety requirements. Unfortunately, certain specialist healthcare devices contain plastics made using toxic materials, despite the availability of safer al- ternatives. Further, high volumes of plastic waste, including single-use products, packaging, and com- plex plastic composites (often made from toxic ma- terials), are generated in healthcare facilities. Due to fear of contamination, recycling of medical de- vices has often been considered a \"no-go\" option in the waste industry.202 Further work towards phasing out of hazardous chemicals and substitution with non-toxic alterna - tives should be encouraged and supported, highl- ighting that a high level of patient care and safety must be maintained. Elimination of toxic chemicals is also important in order to encourage a circular economy; to reduce the risk to primary consumers' health in the first instance, but also and to avoid the presence of banned toxic chemicals in products made from of recycled materials, thereby reducing secondary risk to human health and the environ- ment. The success of the plastics circular economy in Eu- rope does not rely on recycling and reuse only and there is a need to reduce the unnecessary use of plastics, particularly in healthcare. A growing num - ber of hospitals and healthcare providers are ma- king efforts to reduce single-use and non-essential plastics, and increasing recycling wherever possib- le. For those medical devices where it is currently essential to use plastics, safer plastics can often be substituted. Elimination of problematic or unneces - sary plastics should happen through design/rede- sign, innovation, and new delivery models. Proper diversion and recycling are also crucial for plastics use reduction. In the future, all essential plastics should be 100% reusable, recyclable, or compost- able. The European healthcare sector, with 12,990 hos- pitals and over 2.8 million hospital beds, is a major purchaser of goods and services. The sector, the- refore, has the potential to drive transformation in the production and consumption of plastics by le-veraging its combined purchasing power. Through strategic partnerships and collective action, Euro- pean healthcare can stimulate adoption and de- velopment of new products and packaging and lead us out of the current plastics crisis. Awareness about actions to eliminate harmful plas- tics must be raised within the healthcare sector, highlighting that a high level of patient care and sa- fety can be maintained. Furthermore, as some of the most highly trusted figures in society, healthca - re professionals have the capacity and moral obli- gation to educate the communities they serve and trigger widespread beneficial behaviour changes in plastic use. We recommend the following immedia- te actions for European healthcare providers: l Educate staff and patients about environmen - tal and health hazards of plastic usage. l Undertake baseline assessments to improve understanding of the scale of plastic use and waste. l Discourage use of plastic-related material un- less absolutely necessary; encourage the use of reusable instruments and materials hospi- tals (whilst safeguarding patient care), infor- med by whole-life costing evaluations. l Focus on quick-win substitutions. For example, phase-out non-medical single-use plastics and substitute harmful medical plastics with exis- ting safer alternatives. l Facilitate dialogue between manufacturers, suppliers, procurement specialists, clinicians and recyclers to assess the full scope of oppor- tunity across the value chain in healthcare. l Establish an overarching strategy for plastics substitution and reduction using the 5 Rs con- cept (reduce, replace, reuse, recycle, rethink). l Identify how plastics reduction in healthcare can align with work in other sectors and the broader movement. NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 35 34 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)A number of governments, regulatory authorities, healthcare systems, hospitals, healthcare profes - sionals and medical devices manufacturers have endorsed a move towards medical devices that are free from hazardous chemicals, so that patients do not have to be exposed to unnecessary risks when safer alternatives are available. This is even more important when patients' exposure can be minimised without compromising medical care, for example by opting for a safer alternative that performs the same function. The phase-out of hazardous chemicals in medical devices is suppor - ted by international and European organisations representing more than 500 hospitals, medical institutions and healthcare systems and 16 million healthcare professionals.203Conclusions Citizens' exposure to DEHP and BPA during medical procedures contributes to a continuous, long-term, and low-level exposure to a mixture of different hazardous chemicals, which causes or enhances adverse effects on human health and the environ- ment. European manufacturers of medical devices, under some regulatory pressure, have increased the development of alternatives to both phthalates and BPA in medical devices. Most medical devices containing phthalates can be substituted relatively easily with less hazardous alternatives at an affor- dable cost.204 Several companies already manufac - ture DEHP-free medical devices either by using PVC plasticisers other than DEHP or not using PVC ma- terial at all. Since widely available and safer alternative medical devices exist, we can protect foetuses, neonates, pre-pubescent children, and other vulnerable pa- tients from exposure to DEHP by insisting on DEHP- free, PVC-free and BPA-free products. The use of DEHP should not be granted to any medical device when safer alternatives are available. Further development of safer medical devices by manufacturers, along with greater demand by ca- regivers and hospitals, could result in a complete transition away from DEHP and BPA.CHAPTER 6 HCWH Europe's Recommendations l Apply the precautionary principle in EU legis- lation so that hazardous chemicals, such as phthalates and BPA contained in medical de- vices, are phased-out if safer alternatives are available and technically feasible. European legislation must protect the safety of patients and healthcare workers and, in particular, the most vulnerable groups. Consistent technical implementation of Annex I.II.10.4 of the MDR must be ensured, in particular to protect the most vulnerable groups. The benefit- risk assessment of the presence of hazardous che- micals in certain medical devices should therefore be subject to the most stringent conformity assess - ment procedures by a Notified Body. Legislation has a crucial double role in both pro- tecting patients and consumers from exposure to hazardous chemicals and in sparking innovation. The adoption of progressive legislation can be a considerable driver of innovation leading to the de- velopment of safer alternatives.205 206 The inclusion of certain phthalates in the Authorisation List un- der REACH, for example, has led to an increase in the number of patented alternatives.207. The MDR's requirement for manufacturers to provide justifi- cation for the use of hazardous chemicals above certain thresholds in invasive medical devices, in addition to the need for application for authorisa - tion expected in the near future for DEHP, should also ultimately lead to an increase in innovation and substitution in the health technology sector. l Increase transparency of the market authorisa - tion process for medical devices and improve the access to the authorisation data on medi- cal devices. The market authorisation for medical devices needs to be improved to ensure that approved medical devices are both efficient and safe for patients. The expanded labelling of hazardous substances intro- duced in the new MDR should be a driver for subs- titution by raising awareness in the healthcare com- munity about the chemical composition of medical devices. Those devices should be subject to strin- gent compliance assessment of required labelling by a Competent Authority. Information labelled in accordance with the MDR should be publicly availa - ble via the revamped European Database on Medi- cal Devices (EUDAMED), so that procurers, resear- chers and other stakeholders have easy access to data on the devices. Clinical data used to approve devices should also be made publicly available so that healthcare professionals can better evaluate the risks and benefits of the medical products and make informed decisions. Improved disclosure of product ingredients would allow healthcare professionals to better unders- tand where hazardous substances are present and to prioritise their replacement. l Avoid regrettable substitutions. l Implement data requirements for medical de- vices approval and registration in the EUDA- MED. The safety evaluation of medical devices needs to be improved. The substitution of a hazardous che- mical with a structurally similar substance to mini- mise impact on the manufacturing of the product or with a substance for which toxicity data is not available must be avoided.206 The existing data requirements on chemicals used in medical devices (for instance the lack of a requi- rement to provide information about alternatives used in a device) hamper the development of ade- quate data on the use, performance and safety of those alternatives. Furthermore, if a compound has a history of use, then its on-going use is assured. For example, continued use of DEHP is justified on the grounds that it has been used for many years and that it helps in the treatment of patients, re- gardless of its proven negative health impacts. Bet- ter evidence concerning the technical performance of alternatives is needed to guarantee that safer alternatives are adopted. l Standards, certifications and tools similar to the EC GPP, the EU Ecolabel and the Nordic Swan label, among others, should be applied to establish harmonised environmental crite- ria for medical devices and different groups of hazardous chemicals to avoid any gaps and in- consistencies. NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019) 37 36 NON-TOXIC HEALTHCARE - SECOND EDITION (2019)Conclusions and recommendations l Adopt regional and national strategies and tools to phase out hazardous chemicals in me- dical devices, such as the substitution group of chemicals created by the Swedish Environ- mental Management Council and the Swedish County Councils. Sustainable procurement guidelines should pro- vide incentives for the substitution of hazardous chemicals in medical devices. Procurement practi- ces can contribute to a quicker phase-out of certain hazardous chemicals in medical devices by driving manufacturers to develop alternatives to those chemicals/products and by assessing if the availa - ble alternatives are feasible. The healthcare sector is a growing industry with a high demand for equip- ment that can, through responsible purchasing po- licies, drive the market. Hospitals are increasingly demanding products that are free of certain groups of chemicals, thereby driving research, innovation and lowering the market price of the products. The introduction of green procurement criteria at the regional, national and European levels can lead to the phase-out of hazardous chemicals in medical devices. l Make available research funds for clinical and epidemiological studies on chemical exposure, particularly for comparing exposure and out- comes in patients being treated with similar devices but containing different chemicals. l Prioritise research and innovation funding for the development of safer products that redu- ce chemical exposure of all types in the health technology sector. l Provide greater incentives for healthcare facili- ties to consider substitution. Funding for research and development of alterna - tive substances and products and for clinical and epidemiological projects that compare the perfor- mance of these alternatives should be prioritised. Governmental authorities should support the de- velopment of safer alternatives to medical devices containing hazardous chemicals and prioritise fun - ding for the development of those substitutes. The diversion of funding for these alternatives can be complementary to the adoption of stricter regula- tions. 1. European Union.
