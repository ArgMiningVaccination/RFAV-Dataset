The layer by layer removal of the stratum corneum by tape stripp ing enables the quantification of drug amounts penetrated into the stratum corneum over ti me. This dermatopharmacokinetic (DPK) approach has been subject of fervent discussions in the past years, and concern about adequacy and reproducibility of the technique has b een expressed. Yet, the successful performance of reliable and reproducible tape strip ping investigations highly depends on the use of a standardized methodology and suitable anal ytical methods. This thesis proposed a standardized tape stripping protocol in combination with carefully validated analytical methods (Project I). After a proof of concept, the set of m ethods was applied in an in vivo investigation of the influence of different factors on topical bioav ailability. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects ultimately determining the successful therapy outcome were investigated: the effect of dose and application fr equency (Project II), the effect of occlusion (Project III), and the efficacy of a low-dose TACA formulation (Project IV). Concomitantly, the corticosteroid accumulation within the stratum corn eum (reservoir development) was monitored, since a reservoir can considerably affect the thera py outcome and is particularly advantageous to prevent systemic side effects. In Project I, the tape stripping technique was standardized and an HPLC method for TACA quantification on tapes after extraction was valida ted. The standardized tape stripping protocol included the use of a template (ensured the removal of stratum corneum samples from the same skin site) and a hand roller (ensured a consta nt pressure on the tape before stripping), and, most importantly, the removal of the entire st ratum corneum of one skin site to cope with inter- and intra-individual differences in stratum corneum thickness. The HPLC method for TACA quantification was successfully validated and proved to have suitable specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and robustness in the working range. The combination of 1) standardized tape stripping as sampling method, 2) UV/VIS-spectr oscopy for quantification of corneocytes (previously validated), and 3) the new validated HP LC method for quantification of TACA was then applied in a proof of concept with 6 healthy v olunteers. TACA was applied on their forearm skin in either an acetonic solution or an ethanolic gel, and stratum corneum samples were removed by tape stripping after 0.5 h, 3 h, and 24 h. A clear vehicle effect on the TACA penetration could be observed. Whereas TACA deeply penetrated into the stratum corneum after application of the acetonic solution, the pen etration after application of the ethanolic gel was only superficial (development of a skin surface reservoir). The method set proved to be suitable for the investigation of the TACA penetrat ion into stratum corneum and was applied in a pharmacokinetic clinical trial with healthy volunte ers (Projects II and III). Summary Carolina Pellanda Page 3 of 186 University of Base l, 2006 In Project II , the effect of dose and application frequency on t he in vivo penetration of TACA into stratum corneum was investigated in 15 healthy volunteers. Dose and application frequency of topical corticosteroids are recurrently debated topics. Multiple-daily applications are common, although a superior efficacy compared to once-daily applications is not unequivocally proven. In the dose experiment, higher TACA amounts were quant ified within the stratum corneum after application of a high dose (300 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 100 \u00b5g/cm 2; acetonic solution). However, this difference was only significant immediately after a pplication, and no difference was recorded at 4 h and 24 h. The application frequency experiment showed slightly higher TACA amounts within the stratum corneum after multiple applicati on (3x100 \u00b5g/cm 2) than after single application of the total dose (1x300 \u00b5g/cm 2). As a result of multiple applications, the skin w as periodically reloaded with new drug, thus achieving temporary higher amounts within the stratum corneum and redissolving potential TACA cry stals. The still well quantifiable TACA amount retained within the stratum corneum at 24 h was rather due to the slow diffusion through the stratum corneum barrier than to a classical res ervoir formation. The performance of a mass balance showed that a high TACA dose could result i n faster stratum corneum permeation and higher systemic exposure, unwelcome in topical ther apy. Thus, a low dose applied once daily may be preferable to higher doses. In Project III , the effects of occlusion before (pre-occlusion) TACA application 2; acetonic solution) were investigated on the forea rms of 10 healthy volunteers. Occlusion is known to enhance skin hydr ation and can induce the formation of a stratum corneum reservoir. Moreover, occlusion is c linically used to improve the efficacy of topical corticosteroids in severe forms of skin dis eases. Pre-occlusion showed no effect on the TACA penetration into stratum corneum. In contrast, post-occlusion enhanced the TACA penetration by a factor of 2, favoring the developm ent of a 24 h-lasting reservoir. The efficacy of low-dose TACA in the treatment of a topic dermatitis was proved in Project IV , pharma 14 patients. Low-dose TACA was added to a marketed skin care cream (Lichtena \u00ae) in a concentration which was 40 times lower than typical therapeutical corticosteroid concentrations (25 vs. 1000 \u00b5g/g). Twice-daily appl ication of the low-dose TACA formulation reduced the severity of the lesions (assessed by SC ORAD) already after 1 week. In contrast, the cream base alone had no significant influence o n the severity of atopic dermatitis measured for 1 month. These findings indicate that some cort icosteroids may already be effective at much lower concentrations than usually used therapeutica lly, and that marketed corticosteroid formulations may contain a much higher concentratio n than necessary. The investigations described in this thesis show ho w tape stripping, correctly performed, asserts itself as a valuable technique for topical bioavail ability assessment. The DPK approach can be applied for the investigation of topical bioavailab ility of other compounds as well, provided that specific analytical methods for their quantificatio n are developed and validated. Re- implementation of the DPK approach on regulatory le vel could be considered. Aim of the thesis Carolina Pellanda Page 5 of 186 University of Base l, 2006 Aim of the thesis The aim of this thesis was to investigate in vivo the topical bioavailability of a model glucocorticosteroid, triamcinolone acetonide (TACA) , using tape stripping. The layer by layer removal of the stratum corneum by tape stripping en ables the quantification of drug amounts penetrated into the stratum corneum over time. This DPK approach has been subject of fervent discussions in the past years, and concern about ad equacy and reproducibility of the technique has led to the withdrawal of the corresponding FDA draft guidance \"Topical dermatological drug products NDAs and ANDAs - In vivo bioavailability, bioequivalence, in vitro release, and associated studies\" [1]. Currently, no technique is advised at regulatory level for the specific assessment of topical bioavailability. Since the successful performance of reliable and re producible tape stripping investigations highly depends on the techniques used, this thesis proposes a standardized tape stripping protocol in combination with carefully validated an alytical methods (UV/VIS-spectroscopy, HPLC) to possibly rehabilitate the tape stripping t echnique (Project I). After proof of concept with 6 healthy volunteers, the set of methods was a pplied to investigate in vivo different factors which influence percutaneous penetration and which thus, ultimately, influence the successful outcome of a topical therapy. The therapeutical cla ss of corticosteroids was chosen because it is still the gold standard for the therapy of sever al dermatological affections. Among the wide palette of corticosteroids, TACA as a commonly used and moderately potent steroid was chosen as model. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacod ynamic aspects were investigated. The effect of the following pharmacokinetic paramet ers on the TACA penetration into stratum corneum was assessed in a clinical trial with 25 he althy volunteers: dose, application frequency, and occlusion. Dose and application frequency (Proj ect II) of topical corticosteroids are recurrently debated topics. Multiple-daily applicat ions are common, although a superior efficacy compared to once-daily applications is not unequivo cally proven. Occlusion (Project III) is known to enhance the percutaneous penetration of ma ny but not all drugs. Moreover, occlusion can induce the formation of a drug reservoir within the stratum corneum. A skin reservoir is desired in topical therapy, since the drug should r emain for a long time at the site of action, exerting a local and not a systemic action. Finally , the efficacy of a low-dose TACA formulation was assessed in a pharmacodynamic clinical trial wi th 14 patients suffering from atopic dermatitis (Project IV). This thesis is structured into a theoretical and an experimental section. The theoretical section gives an overview of: anatomy and physiology of the skin (Chapter 1); principles of percutaneous absorption and topical bioavailability (Chapter 2); techniques for the assessment of topical bioavailability and regulatory requireme nts (Chapter 3); skin reservoir (Chapter 4); and topical corticosteroids (Chapter 5). In this last c hapter, both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic aspects of dose, application freque ncy, and occlusion are reviewed. The experimental section describes the validation of th e methodology (Project I) and the results of the in vivo investigations (Projects II-IV), submitted for pub lication in different scientific journals. THEORETICAL SECTION 1. Human skin Carolina Pellanda Page 9 of 186 University of Base l, 2006 1. Human skin 1.1. Skin anatomy and physiology The human skin (integumentum commune) is the barrie r between the organism's internal environment and its surroundings. With an area of 1 .5-1.8 m2, it is our biggest organ. The following vital functions are ensured by the skin: mechanical and chemical protection, protection against UV radiation and micro-organisms, thermoreg ulation, and sensory perception. Anatomically, the skin can be divided into subcutis and cutis (Fig.1-1). The subcutis (tela subcutanea) fat (pannic ulus adiposus) separated by septa of connective tissue. The fat is responsible for therm o-insulation, and the connective tissue incorporates lymph and blood vessels reaching into the dermis. The cutis is divided into dermis (corium) and epidermis, which are firmly bound toge ther in the dermo-epidermal junction by hemidesmosomes on the epidermal side and by on the dermal side [2]. Fig.1-1: Schematic representation of the different skin layers (from [2]). The dermis is about 1-3 mm thick, and consists of cells (fibro blasts, inflammatory cells) and fibers (collagen, elastic, reticular) embedded in a n amorphous matrix consisting of mucopolysaccharides produced by the fibroblasts. Al so present in the dermis are: blood and lymph vessels, free nerves endings for the percepti on of temperature, itching and pain, encapsulated nerve endings such as the Vater-Pacini corpuscles (sensitive to pressure and vibration) and the Meissner's corpuscles (sensitive to touch), nerves for the vegetative innervation, and muscles (M. arrector pili, mimetic muscles). Skin appendages (hair, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, nails) originate in the dermi s or in the upper subcutis (sweat glands). Cutis Subcutis Sweat gland 1. Human skin Carolina Pellanda Page 10 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Structurally, the dermis comprises the deeper situa ted, thicker stratum reticulare (few cells except fibroblasts, many fibers) and the stratum pa pillare (many cells, capillaries, nerves), located just below the epidermis [2]. The epidermis is the outermost skin layer and is a vessel-free, nerve-free, stratified, squamous epithelium with a water content of 70%. It is nouri shed by the underlying capillary loops of the stratum papillare. The thickness of the epidermis v aries depending on the anatomical region, with mean values of 77 \u00b5m at the forearm [3], minim al values of 30 \u00b5m at the eye lid and maximal values of 1.6 mm at the plantar region. Two kinds of cells make up the epidermis. First, the keratinocytes (90%), which are responsible for keratin production and are kept together by desmosomes. Second, the dendritic cells (10%): mela nocytes and Merkel's cells (respon sible for the perception). The following layers characterize the epidermis: the stratum basa le (basal layer) with one cell layer, the stratum spinosum (prickle cell layer) with 2-5 cell layers, the stratum granulosum (granular layer) with 1-3 cell layers, the stratum lucidum (i n palmar and plantar skin only), and the stratum corneum (corneal layer) with 10-20 cell layers. In a cycle of about 1 month, new keratinocytes originate in the stratum basale, differentiate in t he stratum spinosum, produce keratohyalin- containing granules and lipid/enzymes-containing la mellar bodies (Odland bodies), which are then exocyted in the stratum granulosum and are fin ally transformed into the stratum corneum [2]. Within the stratum corneum , the thickness and 30-40 \u00b5m [4]. The bottom part of the stratum corneum ( stratum compactum) is very firmly bound together by corneo(desmo)somes and intercellular li pids and has an important protective function. The top part is looser in its structure ( stratum disjunctum) and undergoes desquamation by enzymatic digestion of the corneo(d esmo)somes [5]. The thickness of the stratum corneum depends, like the thickness of epid ermis and dermis, on the anatomical region. Mean values of 15 \u00b5m (16 \u00b1 4 cell layers) were recorded at the flexor forearm and maximal values of 1 mm (86 \u00b1 36 cell layers) at the heel [3, 6-8] . 1. Human skin Carolina Pellanda Page 11 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 1.2. Stratum corneum, the skin barrier The stratum corneum consists of 15% water, 70% prot ca n be bricks and of lipids as mortar. The corneocytes are built out of an insoluble protein complex consi sting of highly organized keratin macrofibrils, and they contain natural moisturizing factors (NMF), low-molecular-weight, water- soluble compounds responsible for water retention. The NMF are mainly derived from the protein filaggrin and are composed of amino acids ( 40%), corneoc yte is encapsulated in an insoluble tough protein shell of 10 nm thickness, the cornified cel l envelope, which is covalently bound to an outer lipid envelope consisting of a layer of long- chain ceramides [12]. The free intercellular lipid bilayers of the stratum corneum have a unique composition co mpared to other epithelial lipid bilayers and consist of ceramides (50%), chol esterol (25%), and acids (10-20%, in linoleic acid). No phospholipids are pr esent in healthy stratum corneum, and more than one third of the lipids have chain lengths lon ger than 22 carbons (vs. 16-18 carbons in other mammalian cell membranes) [13]. Most lipids o f the lamellar bilayer are from the Odland bodies, extruded as phospholipids, sphingoli pids, and plasma membrane constituents at the interface stratum granulosum / stratum corneum and then enzymatically cleaved [14]. It was not until the 1940's that the stratum corneu m clearly emerged as the specific site of the skin barrier for both endogenous and exogenous compounds [15, 1 6]. In the 70's, the intercellular lipids were recognized as the primary site of the barrier [17]. The qualitative and quantitative organization of the intercellular lipi d lamellae is determinant for the barrier function. Several models such as the domain-mosaic [18], the sandwich [19], and the single-gel-phase model [20] have been proposed to explain their mole cular organization [21]. An appropriate moisturization level of the stratum corneum, regula ted by the presence of NMF, is also important for the maintenance of an effective skin barrier [11]. The stratum corneum is very resistant to physical ( mechanical, thermic, actinic) and chemical (acids, to a lesser extent bases) damage. The barri er is more sensitive to organic solvents which can extract the intercellular lipids and to d etergents which can damage the cell membrane [22]. Lipophilic compounds usually pass more easily throu gh the lipophilic stratum corneum barrier than hydrophilic compounds. However, the passage th rough the hydrophilic (epi)dermis may then become the rate limiting step for a lipophilic compound. Furthermore, hydrophilic substances may penetrate the barrier also by follic ular pathways [23]. The topic of percutaneous penetration is extensively discussed i n chapter 2. 1. Human skin Carolina Pellanda Page 12 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 1.3. Skin metabolism The maturation process of the stratum corneum requi res the involvement of different enzymes, for example for the formation of the cornified enve lope (e.g., C -glucocerebrosidase, phospholipase A 2, [24]. These enzymes have been detected even in the upper layers of the stratum corneum, an d their activity shows a high pH- dependence [25]. The presence of a wide spectrum of enzymes outlines the highly metabolic activity of the skin, which comprises both phase-1 and phase-2 metabolism . Among hydrolases (e.g., proteases) have been localized within the sk in. Among the phase-2 enzymes, different transferases needed for conjugation to glucuronic a cid, sulphur, glutathione, and glycine have been detected. The skin activity of the CYP 450 enz ymes can be as high as 1-5% of the liver activity and the one of the transferases even 10% [ 26, 27]. Most of the metabolizing enzymes are located in epi dermis, sebaceous glands, and follicles. The resident (e.g., Stap hylococcus epidermidis) can exert additional metabolic activity. Staphylococcus aureus, for exam ple, is responsible for the metabolization of the steroid ester betamethasone 17-valerate psoriatic and Cutaneous metabolism has been observed metabolism of xenobiotics can lead to the inactivat ion of the compound and/or to the formation of toxic metabolites (irritant, allergenic, or even carcinogenic). Yet, the metabolic activity of the skin can also be profitably commercialized, for exa mple with the design of inactive compounds undergoing metabolic transformation in the skin to form the active drug ( prodrug concept ). This can be useful for parent drugs displaying inap propriate lipophilicity, high toxicity, or chemical instability. glucocor ticosteroids (e.g., 17-monoester, 21-monoester, or 17,21-diester) leads to a higher lipophilicity a nd consequently to an enhanced penetration rate and a prolonged dermal retention. By contrast, the antedrug concept is defined by the design of locally highly potent drugs undergoing ra pid metabolic deactivation as soon as the systemic circulation is reached (also known as \"sof t drugs\"). Systemic side effects are minimized and the safety profile is improved. A sin gle compound can consist of a combination of both concepts ( pro-antedrugs ski n to the pharmacologically active prednisolone 17-ester and further metabolized to the less active prednisolone in the systemic circulation. 2. Percutaneous absorption and topical bioavailabil ity Carolina Pellanda Page 13 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 2. Percutaneous absorption and topical bioavailabil ity 2.1. Definitions The EMEA (European Agency for the Evaluation of Med icinal Products) defines the term bioavailability as the \"rate and extent to which the active substan ce or active moiety is absorbed from a pharmaceutical form and becomes ava ilable at the site of action\" [30]. The \"absence of a significant difference in the rate an d extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceuti cal alternatives 1 becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same m olar dose under similar conditions in an appropriate designed study\" is termed bioequivalence [31]. Topical dermatological drug products belong to the class of locally acting drug products [32]. In this case, the site of pharmacological action is th e skin. Stratum corneum and skin surface are considered to be the compartments of invasion, wher eas the blood system represents the compartment of excretion [33]. Therefore, two diffe rent types of bioavailability have to be distinguished for topical application. The topical bioavailability reflects the rate and extent to which the active moiety becomes available at the si te of action, i.e. the skin. The systemic bioavailability , instead, may not properly reflect the cutaneous b ioavailability for medications intended to treat local skin disorders but becomes important for the toxicological evaluation of the body burden and for transdermal therapeutic sys tems (TTSs) [34]. Percutaneous absorption is the uptake of a compound into the systemic circulation after topical application and describes the movement through the various layers of the skin wit h respect to both rate and extent (Fig. 2-1). The percutaneous a bsorption process can be divided into the following 3 steps [ 35]. Penetration is the entry of a substance into a particular laye r. Permeation is the passage through one layer into another layer. Absorption is the uptake of a substance into the vascular system (blood and/or lymph vessel), which acts as the central compartment, and reflects the systemic bioa vailability. Fig. 2-1: Different compartments that a compound has to pass through during percutaneous absorption. 1 Drug products are pharmaceutical equivalents if they contain the same amount of the same active substance(s) in the same dosage forms that meet the same or compara ble standards and pharmaceutical alternatives if they contain the same active moiety but differ in chemical form (salt, ester, etc) or in dosage form or strength [3 0].

Routes of penetration into the skin There are 3 potential routes of penetration from th e skin surface into the epidermis (Fig. 2-2) [36]: 1) the intercellular route, 2) the transcellu lar route, and 3) the transappendageal route through either the eccrine (sweat) glands or the ha ir follicles with their associated sebaceous glands. Fig. 2-2: The 3 possible routes of penetration into the stratum corneum: 1) intercellular, 2) transcel lular, 3) transappendageal route. The stratum corneum d according to the brick-and-mortar model [9, the corneocytes represent the bricks, the intercell ular lipids represent the mortar. Under normal circumstances, the predominant is the intercellular route , which consists of a tortuous route along the cornified envelope-armored corneocytes through the structured intercellular lipid bilayers [37, 38]. The tortuous diffusional path length has been estimated to be as long as 300-500 \u00b5m [39, 40] in contrast to a mean stratum corneum th ickness of just 20 \u00b5m. The transport process involves sequential diffusion and partitioning between the polar head group regions and the long alkyl chains of the lipi ds [41]. The transcellular route is possible for small hydrophilic substances like water [38]. Waibl er observed an in vivo intracellular distribution of hydrophilic dyes (patent blue, sodi um fluoresceine) applied in water, and a prevalent intercellular distribution of the lipophi lic dye curcumin applied in liquid paraffin [42]. The transappendageal route was, in the past, considered to play a subordinate role during percutaneous penetration, since the skin surface of the appendages yields only a maximal of 0.1% of the total skin surface 2. The contribution of the appendages was regarded a s an initial \"shunt\" diffusion, whereas the main \"bulk\" diffusio n took place through the stratum corneum [33]. Yet, the transappendageal route can be releva nt for polar steroids showing a low diffusion through the stratum corneum [44, 45] as well as for lipophilic compounds [43]. A higher impact of the transappendageal route on percutaneous absor ption has to be expected on the forehead, where the follicle density is very high (292 follic les/cm 2 vs. 14-22 /cm 2 in other skin regions) [46]. 2 De facto , the actual area for potential transfollicular abs orption is much higher than the mere skin surface a rea because the hair follicle is an invagination of the epidermis extending absorption and topical bioavailabil ity Carolina Pellanda Page 15 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 2.3. Mathematical models 2.3.1. Fick's laws of diffusion After application of a topical formulation, the act ive compound has to be released from the vehicle, partition between vehicle and stratum corn eum, and diffuse through (and partition between) the different layers of the skin before it can exert its pharmacological action, finally being \"excreted\" into the systemic circulation (Fig . 2-3). Diffusion is a passive kinetic process taking place along a concentration gradient from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. The diffusion through the skin can be described by Fick's first law : Adt dm dx dc DJ1== (Equation 1) where J is the steady state flux of the compound ma ss (m) through the stratum corneum per unit area (A) and unit time (t) ( \u00b5g/cm 2s), D is the diffusion coefficient of the compound in the stratum corneum (cm 2/s), c is the drug concentration, and x is the posi tion [47]. The solution of the equation with the appropriate boundary conditio ns gives: ckchDKJp== (Equation 2) where K is the partition coefficient of the compoun d between vehicle and stratum corneum, h is the diffusional pathlength (cm), k p is the permeability coefficient, and c (= cappl - crec ) is the concentration difference ( \u00b5g/cm 2) across the stratum corneum between applied concen tration (c appl) and concentration below the stratum corneum ( in vivo ) or in vitro , crec ) [36, 48]. Under normal circumstances, the applied concentration (c appl) is much larger than the concentration in deeper skin layers, and c can be replaced with c appl. The real diffusional pathlength (h) is the tortuous pathway along the in tercellular lipids, which is longer than the mere stratum corneum thickness. However, the stratu m corneum thickness is mostly used, since it is easily measurable. If the steady state is not attained, the diffusiona l flux can be explained by Fick's second law , which describes the concentration change over time at a definite position x within the membrane [47]: 2)(2 ),( )( xcDtc xJx tx x Different solutions of this equation with appropria te boundary conditions have been proposed [49-51]. 2. Percutaneous absorption and topical bioavailabil ity Carolina Pellanda Page 16 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Fig. 2-3: Schematic depiction of percutaneous absor ption (modified from [52]). 2.3.2. Solubility The concentration difference of the compound across the skin or the membrane (concentration gradient c) is the driving force for diffusion. A balance ha s to be found between good solubility within the vehicle and good release from the vehicl e [48]. The maximal stable concentration is achieved at saturation solubility (thermodynamic ac tivity or leaving potential = 1) [48]. Particles suspended within the vehicle do not directly contri bute to the concentration gradient but constitute a reservoir maintaining saturation condi tions in the vehicle for a prolonged time. 2.3.3. Partition coefficient (K) The partition coefficient is a thermodynamic, time- independent factor and displays the relative preference of a compound to stay either within the vehicle or within the membrane. The degree of partitioning is dependent on the relative solubi lity (affinity) of the compound in both vehicle and membrane. A hostile vehicle environment, and th us a higher affinity to the membrane, favors partitioning [48]. 2.3.4. Diffusion coefficient (D) The degree of diffusion within a specific medium (v ehicle, membrane) is described by the diffusion coefficient. The diffusion coefficient de pends on: the physicochemical properties of both the diffusing compound (size, radius) and the diffusional medium (viscosity), temperature, and pressure. The Einstein diffusion equation points out the dependency on these factors [47]: Stratum corneum (lipophilic) Viableepidermis Percutaneous absorption and topical bioavailabil ity Carolina Pellanda Page 17 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 r6TBk r6ANTRD= = (Equation 4) where 2.3.5. Permeability coefficient (k p) The permeability coefficient is a heterogeneous rat e constant characteristic for a membrane and a compound and is expressed as depth of diffusion p er unit time (cm/h): hDKkp= (Equation 5) This constant can be calculated from experimental r esults by dividing the flux J with the concentration difference c (see Equation 2), whereas it is more difficult to calculate the terms K and D separately [41]. Permeability is influenced to a greater extent by v ariation of the partition coefficient than by variation of the diffusion coefficient. This can be observed in the analysis of a homologous series (e.g., of n-alkanols), where partition coeff icient and permeability coefficient increase with increasing chain length, whereas the diffusion coef ficient remains more or less constant (Table 2-1) [35]. Table 2-1: Average permeability data for n-alkanols .

Percutaneous absorption and topical bioavailabil ity Carolina Pellanda Page 18 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 2.4. Factors affecting percutaneous absorption 2.4.1. Overview Factors affecting percutaneous absorption and topic al bioavailability of topically applied compounds are: - the physicochemical characteristics of the compound - the physicochemical characteristics of the vehicle - the application conditions - the skin conditions. 2.4.2. Physicochemical characteristics of the compo und Molecular weight (size), degree of ionization (char ge), and lipophilicity are important factors determining the partition and diffusion coefficient s [35, 53]. The molecular weight is inversely proportional to percutaneous absorption and seems t o particularly influence the diffusion coefficient. Molecules larger than 500 Daltons have usually more difficulty to pass through the healthy stratum corneum [54]. It is a common presum ption that only non-ionized compounds are able to diffuse through the lipophilic intercellula r regions of the stratum corneum. Yet, ionized compounds have been reported to permeate through hu man skin through the intracellular and transappendageal pathway, albeit at a slower rate [ 35]. Moreover, the formation of ion pairs between compound ions and ions present in the skin can lead to neutral compounds [41]. As most drugs are either weak acids or weak bases, the pH of aqueous vehicles determines the ionization state (compare chapter 2.4.3) [48, 55]. The best percutaneous absorption would be achieved by an amphiphilic compound showing both high solubility in the lipophilic stratum corn eum (maximal input into the stratum corneum) and high aqueous solubility in the hydrophilic viab le epidermis (maximal output into deeper layers). In general, compounds with a log K octanol/water of about 1-3 have optimum partition behavior [56]. High penetration into the stratum co rneum but limited penetration into the viable epidermis (observed for very lipophilic compounds) may induce a reservoir into the stratum corneum (see chapter 4). The same can occur for com pounds with small diffusivity in the stratum corneum and for compounds binding to specif ic tissue components [35]. 2. Percutaneous absorption and topical bioavailabil ity Carolina Pellanda Page 19 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 2.4.3. Physicochemical characteristics of the vehic le The vehicle can both influence drug release as well as alter the stratum corneum structure. Drug release is affected by the viscosity of the ve hicle (alteration of diffusion coefficient) and by the solubility of the compound in the vehicle. Alte ration of the stratum corneum structure includes extraction of intercellular skin lipids an d occlusive effects. The pH of the vehicle, the state of the compound in the vehicle (dissolved, su spended), the concentration of the compound, and the presence of cosolvents (e.g., pro pylene glycol), penetration enhancers (e.g., urea, DMSO 3), and surfactants are all factors influencing perc utaneous absorption. Among the penetration enhancers, two types can be d istinguished: those influencing diffusion (e.g., Azone \u00ae4, oleic acid, surfactants) and those influencing pa rtitioning (most solvents, e.g., propylene glycol) [41]. After application of a topical formulation to the s kin, the vehicle undergoes important structural changes also known as \"metamorphosis of the vehicle \". The partitioning between vehicle and stratum corneum, and thus the penetration into stra tum corneum, is different for each component of the formulation. In addition, evaporat ion of the different ingredients is possible. After application of a compound in a volatile vehic le (e.g., ethanol, acetone), the rapid evaporation of the vehicle subsequently increases t he concentration and the saturation degree of the compound, thus altering the driving force of diffusion (enhanced thermodynamic activity). The maximum drug penetration into the skin is known to take place when the drug is in a saturated state [57]. In some cases, supersaturatio n can occur and thus further enhance percutaneous penetration [58]. After complete evaporation of the solvent, the remn ant drug precipitates onto the skin as \"solvent deposited solid\". In this case, percutaneo us penetration becomes a dissolution rate limited process [59, 60]. Percutaneous absorption f ollowing application in a volatile vehicle is quite different than percutaneous absorption from n on-volatile vehicles and is not a steady-state process [61]. Akther et al. observed, after applica tion of flurbiprofen and ibuprofen in acetone, an initially low percutaneous penetration which the n increased as soon as evaporation of the vehicle took place [60]. Different mathematical mod els of percutaneous absorption kinetics after application of finite vehicle volumes and solvent d eposited solids have been [49]. and topical bioavailabil ity Carolina Pellanda Page 20 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 2.4.4. Application conditions Dosing technique, dose, and application under occlu sion are the most important application conditions affecting percutaneous absorption. Two main dosing techniques are known - the infinite and the finite. The infinite dose technique concerns the application of an amount of material m uch higher than is expected to penetrate into the skin. The surplus of material forms a surf ace reservoir which appears to be \"infinite\". The steady-state flux after application of an infin ite dose follows Fick's first law of diffusion (described in chapter 2.3.1). The finite dose technique is more closely related to clinical settings. A definite, low amount of material is app lied. With time, the amount of material on the skin surface is depleted and the flux into the skin decreases. No steady-state flux can be observed. In this case, the diffusion has to be exp lained with an appropriate solution of Fick's second law (chapter 2.3.1), and several models have been proposed [62-64]. A special case at the boundary between finite and infinite dosing is observed after finite application of poorly absorbed compounds (e.g., corticosteroids). In this case, the amount recovered on the skin surface after penetration is usually high (ca. 60-9 5% of the dose applied) and forms a not completely depleted (i.e. infinite) surface reservo ir. Table 2-2 outlines the different dosing techniques 2-2: Dosing for topical drug cation (modified from [65]). Dosing technique Loading Estimated bioavailability Comment Infinite dose high (> 10 mg/cm 2) < 5% (typically 1-2%) Mostly for experimental setti ngs Finite/Infinite dose clinical use (0.5-5 mg/cm 2) < 5% (typically 1-2%) Poorly absorbed molecules in clinical situations (e.g., corticosteroids) Finite dose clinical use (0.5-5 mg/cm 2) > 10% (typically 25-50%) Well absorbed molecules in clinical situations (e.g., nitroglycerin) After application of a single dose , the following parameters have been shown to influ ence percutaneous absorption: concentration of the dose, applied film thickness, area on which the dose is applied, and duration of the application. T he effect of concentration on the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is explained in detail in chapter 5.2. Other effects have been reviewed by Surber and Davis [65]. Occlusion is defined as the external insulation of the skin w ith a water evaporation limiting barrier [66] and can be performed either by coverin g the skin with an impermeable wrap (e.g., plastic film, tape or wound wrap, gloves, impermeab le textiles, diapers) or by applying topical vehicles containing fats or oils (e.g., petrolatum or paraffin). Because of the inhibition of the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) from the skin surf ace by occlusion, the normal water content of the stratum corneum (10-20%) can be increased by up to 50%. Even short-time occlusion 2. Percutaneous absorption and topical bioavailabil ity Carolina Pellanda Page 21 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 (e.g., 30 min) results in a overhydration of the sk in [67, 68]. Water has been shown to accumulate either within the corneocytes, inducing their swelling 5 [69], or within the intercellular lipids, forming intercellular water pools [70]. Mor eover, occlusion has an effect on: skin surface temperature (increase from 32\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C), blood flo w, composition of epidermal lipids, DNA synthesis, epidermal morphology and turnover, compo sition of the microbial skin flora, pH, and activity of sweat glands and Langerhans cells. In g eneral, the barrier function of the stratum corneum is reduced occlusion [67, 71]. The incre ased stratum corneum hydration and increased temperature can positively alter the part itioning of applied compounds between vehicle, stratum corneum, and viable epidermis, thu s enhancing percutaneous absorption in a simple manner. After occlusion, the hydrated stratu m corneum and the viable epidermis appears more similar (facilitated partitioning), wi th a greater effect for lipophilic compounds [72, 73]. The specific effect of occlusion on the penetr ation of topically applied compounds with a focus on corticosteroids is described in chapter 5. 4. 5 The swelling of the corneocytes is more pronounced in the thickness: 25-30% increase in thickness and 3-5% increase in length have been observed after occlusion [69]. 2. Percutaneous absorption and topical bioavailabil ity Carolina Pellanda Page 22 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 2.4.5. Skin conditions The main skin conditions affecting percutaneous abs orption are: the anatomic site, the temperature, the blood flow, and the health state. Minor factors are: age, skin type, race, gender, and the circadian rhythm of the barrier fun ction. Percutaneous absorption in man varies depending on the anatomic site (reviewed in Wester and Maibach [74]). Experiments with hydrocortisone resulted in the following rank order of penetration: scrotum > forehead > scalp > back > fo rearm > palm > plantar skin [75]. There are 3 main theories which attempt to explain the region al differences in percutaneous absorption: first, the variation of stratum corneum thickness a nd especially the lipid composition [76]; second, the different distribution of skin appendag es acting as shunts; third, the differences in cutaneous blood flow [23]. Increased blood flow and skin hydration can be caused by an increased skin temperature and occlusion. A higher skin temperature increases the compound solubility and diffusion within vehicle and stratum corneum, thus enhancing percutaneous absorption [65]. Physical (weather, sunlight, occlusion), chemical ( solvents, detergents, acids, alkalis), and pathological factors (mechanical damage, skin disea ses) all influence the state of the skin . Many skin disorders (e.g., atopic dermatitis, psori asis, ichthyosis, xerosis) are characterized by an imbalance of the lipid composition and structure , especially of the stratum corneum ceramides. In addition, a diminished water-binding property, a lack of NMF, an incomplete maturation of the cornified envelope, and a defecti ve corneocyte cohesion and desquamation have been reported [14]. The impaired barrier funct ion of atopic and psoriatic skin is reflected by the increased TEWL [77]. The penetration into disea sed or experimentally disrupted skin (e.g., by phonophoresis, electroporation, or tape strippin g) can significantly differ from the penetration into healthy skin, even allowing the penetration of larger molecules, which would normally not penetrate (Fig. 2-4) [54]. Fig. 2-4: Influence of the molecular weight and the state of the skin on human skin penetration. Norma l human skin (NS), atopic dermatitis skin (AD), mucosa (M), and ultrasound treated skin (US) [54]. 100 Penetration [%] 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 MW [Dalton] NS AD M US 0 2. Percutaneous absorption and topical bioavailabil ity Carolina Pellanda Page 23 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Turpeinen et al. observed a statistically significa nt enhanced percutaneous absorption after application of hydrocortisone cream in children [78 , 79] and from atopic dermatitis. percutaneous absorption correlated with the severity of the dermatitis, and diminished with the restoration of the skin. With p atients suffering from psoriasis, Schaefer et al. observed an enhanced TACA penetration after applica tion of ointment and cream preparations. TACA concentrations 3-10 times higher than in healt hy skin were quantified within epidermis and dermis [81]. Yet, Wester el al. observed simila r hydrocortisone absorption in stable psoriatic plaques and healthy skin [82]. Age seems to exert a minor effect on percutaneous abso rption. Whereas the stratum corneum barrier of premature infants is not completely matu re, the skin of term infants seems to possess barrier properties already comparable to that of ad ult skin, and a similar percutaneous absorption can be expected [83]. Reports of drug to xicity after topical drug applications in children are mainly due to the higher surface area- to-weight ratio [84]. With increasing age, the skin undergoes important morphological, physiologic al, and biochemical changes. The number of dermal capillary loops, the skin lipid content, and the hydration status of stratum corneum decrease, and the dermis undergoes atrophy [85]. Th is leads to a decreased percutaneous absorption, particularly observed for hydrophilic c ompounds [86]. Racial differences in skin properties have been reported. Black skin has higher TEWL, variable blood vessel reactivity, decreased skin surface pH, and larger mast cell granules compared to white skin. The results about Asian and Hispanic sk in are inconclusive [87]. Reed et al. observed that the skin type is a more relevant determinant of barrier function than race itself. Despite a comparable stratum corneum thickness, dar kly pigmented skin (type V/VI) requires more tape strips to remove the stratum corneum by t ape stripping, showing a superior barrier capacity. The permeability barrier function in skin type II/III does not seem to be affected by race or gender [88]. Also independent of gender are stratum corne um thickness, sebum rate, hydration status, and TEWL [7, 89], and a similar p ercutaneous absorption can be expected in men and women. In conclusion, percutaneous absorpti on seems to be more influenced by inter- individual differences than by racial or gender rel ated differences. The reported circadian rhythm in TEWL (highest in the night), skin surface pH (hi ghest in the afternoon), and skin temperature (highest in the ni ght) suggest higher skin permeability in the evening and the night [90]. Moreover, many endogeno us compounds follow a circadian rhythm. In the specific case of corticosteroids, the time p eriod with the lowest circulating concentration of endogenous cortisol is between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m. Consideration of this factor could be critical for bioequivalence assessment of topical c orticosteroids using the vasoconstriction assay (see chapter 3.1), since the vasoconstrictive effect of the endogenous cortisol could interfere with the effect of the topically applied steroid [91]. 3. Assessment of topical bioavailability Carolina Pellanda Page 24 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 3. Assessment of topical bioavailability 3.1. Regulatory requirements In the US, the following general approaches, listed in order of preference, are regarded as acceptable by the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) of the FDA for bioavailability and/or bioequivalence assessment: 1) pharmacokinetic appro ach based on measurements of the concentration of the active moiety and/or metabolit es in blood, plasma, serum, or other appropriate biological fluid as a function of time; 2) pharmacokinetic approach based on the measurement of the urinary excretion of the active moiety and/or metabolites as a function of time (only appropriate if urinary excretion is a si gnificant mechanism of elimination); 3) pharmacodynamic approach based on the measuremen t of an appropriate acute pharmacological effect of the active moiety and/or metabolites (particularly appropriate to dosage forms not intended to deliver the active moi ety to the bloodstream for systemic distribution); 4) comparative clinical trials; and 5) in vitro studies (21CFR320.24). For drug products that are not intended to be absorbed into the bloodstream, bioavailability may be assessed by measurements intended to reflect the ra te and extent to which the active moiety becomes available at the site of action (21CFR320.2 3) [31]. In the EU, the \"Note for guidance on investigation of bioavailability and bioequivalence\" released by the EMEA states that for products for l ocal use (after oral, nasal, inhalative, ocular, dermal, rectal, vaginal administration) intended to act without systemic absorption, the approach to determine bioequivalence based on systemic measu rements is not applicable and pharmacodynamic or comparative clinical trials are required. The determination of the systemic exposure resulting from locally applied products is only relevant if there is a risk of systemic adverse reactions [30]. Comparative clinical efficacy trials are relatively insensitive, highly variable, time consuming, costly, and need a high number of volunteers. Pharm acodynamic investigations can only be performed if the topically applied compound produce s a measurable pharmacodynamic response, and this is not always the case. Neverthe less, there are two outstanding examples. Corticosteroids induce a vasoconstriction, and the degree of skin blanching can be correlated with the efficacy and potency of the steroid. A rel evant guidance (\"Topical dermatological corticosteroids: in vivo bioequivalence\") by FDA [92] . Furthermore, retinoids induce an enhanced TEWL, which can be use d as pharmacodynamic measure for bioavailability assessment. An explicit approach for measurements intended to r eflect the rate and extent to which the active moiety becomes available at the site of acti on is still missing in the regulatory specifications. It was against this background that the FDA proposed in 1998 a draft guidance for the bioavailability assessment of topical derma tological drug products (\"Topical products NDAs and ANDAs - In vivo bioavailability, bioequivalence, in vitro 3. Assessment of topical bioavailability Carolina Pellanda Page 25 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 release, and associated studies\") [1]. The guidance focused on the DPK approach, which is based on the measurement of the active moiety in th e stratum corneum. The DPK approach is comparable to a blood, plasma, or urine pharmacokin etic approach applied to the stratum corneum. Generally, DPK studies are performed in he althy volunteers, since diseased skin is highly variable and changes over time. Among differ ent models, tape stripping showed the highest potential for the DPK characterization of t opically applied drugs, since the percutaneous penetration was assessable without invasive procedu res. Yet, the draft guidance was withdrawn in 2002 because of the following two reasons 6. The first concern considered the adequacy of the DPK method to assess the bioequivalence of topi cal dermatological drug products, because the products are used to treat a variety of disease s in different part of the skin, not just the stratum corneum. Yet, despite the fact that the tar get site for topical dermatological drug products may not always be the stratum corneum, the drug must still pass through the stratum corneum barrier to reach deeper sites of action. In certain cases, the stratum corneum itself is the site of action (e.g., for antimykotika). For an tiacne drug products, the target sites are the hair follicles and the sebaceous glands, and it has been shown that there is a positive correlation between stratum corneum and follicular concentratio ns. The second concern considered the reproducibility of the DPK method between laborator ies. The detailed presentation of the tape stripping technique in the next chapter will provid e a better understanding of this second concern. 3.2. Tape stripping Tape stripping is a technique which enables the rem oval of the stratum corneum layer by layer. Adhesive tapes are sequentially pressed onto the sa me skin region, and then stripped off [93]. Using a standardized technique, Jacobi et al. showe d that 66% of the stratum corneum is removed with 20 tapes (using Tesa \u00ae Multi-Film Crystal-Clear tape), and nearly the com plete corneum (95%) is removed with 50 tapes [94] . Yet, depending on the adhesive tapes used, up to 100 tapes may be required to remove the entire stratum corneum from one skin site [95] (Fig. 3-1). With the tapes, corneocytes and su bstances previously applied on the skin are removed and can be quantified with an appropriate a nalytical method (e.g., HPLC, spectroscopy, scintillation counting).

Assessment of topical bioavailability Carolina Pellanda Page 26 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 The tape stripping technique was introduced in the early 40's by Wolf. He investigated the topography of the skin by removing layers of corneo cytes with transparent adhesive tapes and by examining them microscopically [96, 97]. In the 50's, Pinkus applied the new technique to investigate the epidermal regeneration process. By taking punch biopsies of stripped skin sites, he observed that tape stripping stimulated the mito tic rate in the stratum basale [98, 99]. The mitotic rate was maximal after 3 days, and a couple of weeks were required for complete skin renewing. Further studies investigating the epiderm al growth kinetic after standardized injury of healthy [100-102] and atopic dermatitis skin [103] by tape stripping were performed. Recently, Choi et al. showed that tape stripping induces the production of cytokines such as interleukins, tumor necrosis factor , and -interferon [104], enhances the enzymatic activity, and increases the ceramides synthesis [105]. The artificial remov al of the stratum corneum barrier by tape stripping has become a frequently used model for si mulating diseased skin [106], and for assessing the efficacy of skin care products in res toring the barrier [107, 108]. Moreover, a percutaneous penetration enhancement of macromolecu les like peptides and oligonucleotides, which usually do not penetrate healthy skin, was ob served after removal of the stratum corneum, thus opening the possibility of topical va ccinations [104, 109]. In the 80's, the methodology was standardized by Du puis et al. [110, 111], making of tape stripping a method widely used in dermatological re search to non-invasively investigate the topical bioavailability and percutaneous penetratio n of topically applied substances. The investigation of the topical activity of antivirali a [112, 113] and antimykotika vehicle effects [116, 117], barrie r function and reservoir formation within the stratum corneum [118-120], and the investigation of the percutaneous penetration and absorption of topical corticosteroids [91, 121-123] are some important examples of application areas. Furthermore, tape stripping has been used to investigate stratum corneum lipids [124] and epidermal enzymes [125]. A prerequisite for making the tape stripping techni que a capable, robust, accurate, and reproducible method to investigate the bioavailabil ity of topically applied drugs is the strict standardization and a clear definition of the strip ping parameters. The technique is susceptible to numerous confounding factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Among the intrinsic factors, the anatomical site, the hydration status of the skin, the cohesion of the corneocytes (influenced as well by the vehicle used [126]), and the presence o f furrows have to be mentioned [127]. Van der Molen observed that topically applied titanium dioxide could still be detected after removal of 40 tapes because of an accumulation in superfici al skin furrows, thus falsifying the results [128]. In addition, interseasonal differences have been observed [129]. Among the extrinsic factors, the type of tape used (e.g., cellophane, p olyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, rayon) [130, 131], the pressure with which the tape is app lied onto the skin, the duration of the pressure, and the force of removal (slow/quick) inf luence the stratum corneum removal [127]. These are the parameters which can and must be stan dardized. Surber et al. outlined a standard protocol for tape stripping experiments [9 3]. The protocol implies the use of a template 3. Assessment of topical bioavailability Carolina Pellanda Page 27 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 to delineate the stripping area, and the exertion o f a definite pressure (e.g., with a roller [132]) on each tape before removal. The use of a roller ha s been shown to prevent artifacts due to furrows and wrinkles [133]. Because of inter-indivi dual differences in stratum corneum thickness, the complete stratum corneum of one skin site should be stripped. In newer investigations, Weigmann et al. used the tape strip ping method to calculate horny layer profiles, in which the amount of drug penetrated is correlate d not only to the tape number stripped but also to the depth of the stratum corneum. This corr elation enables the localization of the drug within the stratum corneum layers. For this purpose , the removal of the entire stratum corneum and the quantification of both corneocytes and drug on the tapes are required [134]. Recently, Jacobi et al. reported a procedure for the estimati on of the removed stratum corneum amount on each tape, thus providing a possibility to avoid the complete removal of the stratum corneum [94]. After a review of all the influencing and confoundi ng factors affecting the tape stripping technique, the withdrawal of the DPK draft guidelin e for the bioavailability assessment of topical dermatological drug products [1] becomes more compr ehensible. The concern of inadequate reproducibility between laboratories is not at all amazing. The FDA draft guidance recommended the application of the test formulation on 8 skin sites on each forearm, with tape stripping performed at incremental times after application. Only 12 tapes, without specification of the type of tape to be used, had t o be stripped. Moreover, the first 2 tapes were discarded from evaluation and the remaining 10 tape s pooled and extracted together. The protocol described in the draft guidance was not ye t mature and did not satisfy the regulatory requirements for bioavailability/bioequivalence ass essment at the time of withdrawal. In the future, the proposal of a more realistic and elabor ated protocol could ensure a successful regulatory basis for a promising and already widely used DPK method like tape stripping. 3. Assessment of topical bioavailability Carolina Pellanda Page 28 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 3.3. Further techniques Other approaches for the assessment of the drug con centration profile in the skin following topical application do exist (reviewed in [65]). Th e most invasive method is represented by the direct excision of skin tissue. The punch biopsy is performed with round disposable knives (diameter 2-10 mm), and the biopsy contains epiderm is, dermis, and part of the subcutis. The shave biopsy is more superficial, contains epidermis and part o f the dermis, and is usually performed with a razor blade [135]. The skin scraping (curettage) technique usually removes the superficial stratum corneum with a dermal curet te, but deeper parts of the epidermis can be sampled as well with a more vigorous scraping [136] . The skin surface biopsy uses quick drying cyanoacrylate glue to remove the stratum cor neum in few samplings. The glue is applied to a glass slide, pressed onto the skin surface, an d then removed after polymerization of the glue [137]. Cutaneous microdialysis enables the real-time assessment of cutaneous drug delivery in a minimally invasive manner. A probe, consisting of a semipermeable dialysis membrane tube and simulating a blood vessel, is inserted into the dermis and perfused by a physiological solution, which equilibrates with the extracellular fluid of the surrounding tissue. Topically applied compounds can thus be determined in the der mal extracellular water [138]. The suction blister technique is usually performed to assess drug level s in the skin after systemic administration. Intra-epidermal blisters a re artificially produced by placing a chamber with several holes onto the skin and applying a vac uum. The suction blister fluid displays approximately the same composition of the interstit ial fluid [139]. In addition to these invasive techniques, several i maging methods have been applied to the skin in the last years. The most promising optical metho ds seem to be the confocal scanning and the confocal Raman microspectroscopy [141, 142]. These new techniques allow to focus a beam to a given depth w ithin the skin and to determine the concentration of the topically applied compound at this level in an absolutely non-invasive manner. 4. Stratum corneum reservoir Carolina Pellanda Page 29 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 4. Stratum corneum reservoir 4.1. Definition The term \"reservoir\" referred to the skin can be de fined as an accumulation of a topically applied compound within the skin or within a partic ular skin layer for a longer time period. This accumulation can be due to: 1) temporary sequestrat ion of compound because of binding to specific structures of the skin (e.g., to keratin, proteins, amino acids [143], collagen fibers [144], stratum corneum lipids [145]); or 2) high partition ing into a specific skin layer (e.g., into the intercellular lipids of the stratum corneum) and re latively slow release into the next layer. The consequence is either a hindered diffusion to deepe r skin layers in the first case, or a low diffusional flux of minimal amounts into deeper tis sues in the second case [53, 146]. In both cases, the reservoir is not a time-stable state, an d the factors rate and extent have to be considered [42]. The formation and the duration of a reservoir can a ffect the topical application in terms of dose and application frequency and should be considered when assessing DPK. During topical therapy with corticosteroids, it is desiderable tha t the drug remains for a long time at the site of action, i.e. within the skin, and that it exerts a local and not a systemic action. In this case, the formation of a stratum corneum reservoir and a slow drug release to deeper skin tissues over a longer time period is advantageous and desired. 4.2. Localization of the reservoir The ability of the skin to store topically applied drugs was already suggested in the 50's, when Malkinson and Ferguson detected 14 C-hydrocortisone in the urine of 2 volunteers 7 day s after topical application [147]. Possible localizations o f the reservoir were: the upper dermis, the viable epidermis, the stratum corneum, the skin app endages, or a drug film on the skin surface. In 1963, Vickers demonstrated the existence of a re servoir for corticosteroids within the stratum corneum of healthy volunteers [148]. After applicat ion of fluocinolone acetonide and TACA in 16 h-occlusion, he observed the typ ical blanching effect due to the vasoconstrictive property on the dermal blood vesse ls. After simple re-occlusion, the vasoconstriction could be observed for 14 days. Vic kers concluded that a depot of corticosteroid was present within the skin and that it could be re -activated by occlusion. Tape stripping experiments demonstrated that it was not possible t o induce a reservoir on stripped skin, and that a reservoir induced on intact skin could be el iminated by tape stripping the stratum corneum [149]. The participation of the drug film o n the skin surface could be excluded by washing the skin with several methods (soap and wat er, ether, 95% ethanol) [148, 150, 151]. Vicker's reservoir was confirmed and quantified in 1966 by Carr and Wieland with 14 C-labeled TACA applied in 95% ethanol under occlusion. More t han 75% of the steroid was detected in the upper stratum corneum [152]. Schaefer et al. sh owed that less than 5% of topically applied 4. Stratum corneum reservoir Carolina Pellanda Page 30 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 TACA (in both an ointment and cream vehicle) was sy stemically absorbed. The healthy stratum corneum was able to retain up to 30% of the steroid as a reservoir, and 70-90% remained on the skin surface [81]. McKenzie and Stoughton excluded the participation o f the dermis to the reservoir development by intradermally injecting TACA in one arm and topi cally applying under occlusion a comparable amount on the contralateral arm of 12 volunteers [1 53]. Initially, a vasoconstriction was observed on both arms, but the vasoconstriction on the \"intradermal-injection-arm\" faded after a couple of hours and did not reappear, whereas a re- occlusion of the \"topical-application-arm\" still developed a vasoconstriction. Yet, the participation of epidermis, dermis, and un derlying tissues to a reservoir formation has recently been revised [146]. Binding to specific sk in structures as well as high partitioning in one skin layer and low release to the next layer is not only possible for the stratum corneum, but also for epidermis and dermis. A high binding to de rmal tissue has been observed for diclofenac in the Wistar rat [154]. Cross et al. observed with human skin in vitro a decreased dermal permeation for the more lipophilic alcohols of a ho mologous series (C2-C10), which resulted in an (epi-)dermal accumulation. They postulated that the dermis may represent a more lipophilic compartment than originally believed [53]. In an in vitro investigation of the fate of dihydroxyacetone (DHA) in human and rat skin, Youri ck et al. observed that 24 h after application of a realistic DHA dose, 22% of the app lied dose was still within the whole skin, with half the amount residing within the stratum corneum and half within the viable epidermis/dermis. Approximately 5% of the DHA was covalently bound to proteins, and the majority of DHA was probably noncovalently bound to free amino acids [1 55]. Jacobi et al. measured high amounts of flufenamic acid, which remained constantly high for 21 h, in porcine dermis in vitro after infinite dosing in wool alcohol ointment [156]. An accumulation of dexamethasone and hydrocortisone was observed in dermis, deeper epide rmis, glycol monoethyl ether) containing veh icle on human and rat skin in vitro [144, 157]. In newer studies, the participation of skin appendages, especially the follicles, to the reservoir formation was also reconsidered [1 58, 159]. A higher lipophilicity of the applied compound [155, 160] as well as the application in p olar vehicles like propylene glycol [161] and ethanol [162] seem to improve the follicular target ing. The formation of a follicular reservoir can become relevant in skin regions with high follicula r density like the forehead [46]. In conclusion, the accumulation of topically applie d compounds within the skin and thus the formation of a reservoir is possible for both lipop hilic and hydrophilic compounds. The reservoir is usually located within the stratum corneum, but can sometimes occur also in viable epidermis, dermis, and follicles. Though the reserv oir formation was initially studied with corticosteroids, it is not restricted to this drug class. A stratum corneum reservoir has been observed for several other compounds, for example a ntimicrobials (hexachlorophene [151], fusidic [171]. 4. Stratum corneum reservoir Carolina Pellanda Page 31 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 4.3. Factors influencing the reservoir The factors promoting a reservoir formation are sub stantially the same as those influencing their percutaneous penetration (see chapter 2.4) [172]. Among the physicochemical properties of the drug , a high lipophilicity and protein affinity is favorable for a reservoir development in the stratu m corneum [53, 173]. A minimal, defined amount of drug has to be applied to induce a reservoir. C larys observed the formation of a 5- day-lasting halcinonide reservoir after application in an oil-in-water vehicle, but only for the highest tested concentration (0.2% vs. 0.05% and 0. 005%) [174]. Carr and Tarnowsky obtained similar findings with TACA ointments (0.1% vs. 0.01 %) [175]. The ability to develop a reservoir is highly depend ent on the vehicle . Vickers observed in vivo that the application of steroids in alcoholic solut ions always induced a reservoir (lasting 9.6 days), hydrophilic creams induced a reservoir in 92 % of the volunteers (lasting 7.4 days), and ointments induced a reservoir in 68% of the volunte ers (lasting 4.6 days). Presumably, the intercellular lipids of the stratum corneum were pa rtly damaged by the alcoholic solvent, thus facilitating drug penetration [149]. In contrast, w ith fluocinolone acetonide in vitro , Munro observed the highest stratum corneum retention afte r application in white petrolatum [172]. Particularly, the presence been shown to promote a reservoir formation. Stoughton observed that the ad dition of 40% DMSO to different formulations could induce an accumulation of 15-100 % more steroid (hydrocortisone, fluocinolone acetonide) within the stratum corneum compared to a DMSO-free vehicle. Even without the need of an application under occlusion, a 16-day-lasting reservoir was formed [150]. The addition of urea to an oil-in water vehicle ind uced a 5-day-lasting reservoir after application of low amounts of halcinonide (0.005%). This was no t observed after application of the urea- free formulation [174]. The addition of Transcutol to a gel vehicle increased the penetration of hydrocortisone into rat skin, decreased its permeat ion across the skin, and induced a skin depot lasting 7 days after a single infinite application under occlusion [144]. As already described in chapter 4.2, a reservoir is often induced after application under occlusion . The enhanced hydration can considerably change th e affinity of the applied compound to the stratum corneum and its partitionin g between the different skin layers (stratum corneum, epidermis, dermis) [153]. The duration of occlusion seems to play an important role: an occlusion 8 hours does not induce a reservoir or induces a r eservoir of short duration [149]. 4. Stratum corneum reservoir Carolina Pellanda Page 32 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 4.4. Relevance of the reservoir The therapeutical and physiological relevance of th e reservoir formation has been the subject of discussions since its discovery. In 1966, Carr and Tarnovsky doubted its relevance. They observed that the percutaneous absorption out of th e stratum corneum reservoir after application of a TACA ointment on the whole body un der occlusion was not sufficient to suppress the pituitary-adrenal axis [175]. Yet, the suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis is not really a phenomenon which can be correlated with th e topical clinical effect. In a therapeutically more relevant study, Stoughton showed that the indu ction of a hexachlorophene reservoir after application of a DMAC-containing formulation increa sed and prolonged the bacteriostatic efficacy of hexachlorophene compared to a commercia l formulation [151]. The main problem during the investigation of topica l bioavailability or percutaneous absorption of topically applied compounds is the application o n usually healthy skin, whereas clinically the compounds are usually applied on diseased skin. In atopic dermatitis, eczema, or psoriasis, the skin displays an impaired stratum corneum barrier a nd a different composition of the stratum corneum lipids. An enhanced penetration and systemi c absorption have to be expected if an intact stratum corneum barrier is not guaranteed. T he induction of a reservoir in diseased skin was not successful in several experiments, for exam ple with volunteers displaying psoriasis or Lichen simplex [149]. Sch\u00e4fer et al. measured higher TACA concentration in psoriatic epidermis and dermis after application of TACA in ointment and cream formulations, and a marked higher systemic absorption compared to healthy skin [81]. Yet, in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, a hydrocortisone reservoir could be formed, and the steroid could be released from the reservoir after 12 h by application of a propylene glycol-containing moisturizer [177]. During therapy with corticosteroids, the reservoir formation seems to have a more preventive than therapeutical relevance [149]. For the formati on of a long-lasting reservoir, a more or less intact stratum corneum is required, and this is in contradiction with the acute therapeutical indication for topical corticosteroids. Nevertheles s, already after a partial regeneration of the stratum corneum, the development of a reservoir bec omes relevant again. Several established application regimens of corticosteroids take advant age of the fact that \"stored\" steroids can be remobilized out of the reservoir by a simple applic ation of moisturizing cream (compare the interval and tandem therapy outlined in chapter 5.1 , \"Application regimen\"). 5. Topical glucocorticosteroids Carolina Pellanda Page 33 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 5. Topical glucocorticosteroids 5.1. Overview Classification Topical corticosteroids are classified according to their efficacy into four potency classes 7 where class I represents mildly potent, class II moderate ly potent, class III potent, and class IV very potent corticosteroids. The same drug can be classi fied into a different potency class depending on the concentration and the vehicle (Table 5-1). T his classification is based upon the vasoconstrictive properties of the corticosteroids, macroscopically visible as a the Niedner [180]). Corticosteroid mild (class I) moderately strong (class II) strong (class III) very strong (class topica l corticosteroids can be classified into four generations. Starting from hydrocortisone and predn isolone (1 st generation), several chemical modifications have been performed to enhance the de sired pharmacological effects (e.g., anti- inflammatory, anti-proliferative effects) and to re duce the adverse effects (e.g., the mineralocorticoid effect). The halogenation of the compounds led to a higher efficacy but also to a higher rate of side effects (2 nd and 3 rd generation). The design of ester prodrugs led to h ighly effective compounds with a better side effect profi le [180]. 7 In the Anglo-American region, the potency classifi cation includes 7 classes, where class 1 represents the superpotent, and class 7 the mildly potent corticosteroids [178] . 5. Topical glucocorticosteroids Carolina Pellanda Page 34 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Glucocorticoid effects and indications The antiphlogistic, immunosuppressive, and antiprur iginous effects of corticosteroids are used for the treatment of the atopic dermatitis, of the seborrhoeic, nummular, and allergic contact dermatitis, as well as of the dishydrotic eczema. M ore potent corticosteroids additionally exerting an antiproliferative effect are used in th e treatment of molecular effects result by of the cort icosteroid to the intracellular gluco- corticosteroid receptor. After molecular transforma tion, the complex is translocated into the nucleus, where it represses or activates the expres sion of various genes. Moreover, non- genomic effects result by binding of the steroid to membrane-associated receptors [182, 183]. Table 5-2 summarizes the effects observable at the cellular level. Table 5-2: Cellular effects of topical glucocortico steroids [184]. Cell type Cellular effect Keratinocytes Inhibition of proliferation and norma lization of the hornification process Fibroblasts Inhibition of the synthesis of collagen e and mucopolysaccharides Lymphocytes, granulocytes Inhibition of immigration and proliferation Mast cells, basophils Inhibition of the release of inflammatory mediators Langerhans cells Inhibition of proliferation and fu nction Melanocytes Inhibition of pigment formation Adipocytes Inhibition of proliferation Blood vessels Vasoconstriction Adverse effects and contraindications The antiproliferative effect of potent corticostero ids can lead to local effects such as atrophy of epidermis and dermis. This has been reported with v ery potent steroids, after a long treatment period, and after application under occlusion. The atrophogenic potential of the very potent corticosteroids is clinically used for the treatmen t of keloids, where the steroid is directly injecte d into the skin. Furthermore, the a disturbed wound healing are possible. Skin infections can occur because of the immunosuppressive effect. Allergy to the steroid or to the vehicle has been reported, as wel l as the development of glaucoma if potent corticosteroids (class 3 and 4) are applied near th e eye. Tachyphylaxis and rebound phenomena have been described after prolonged thera py and abrupt discontinuing of the therapy. Therefore, a short-term therapy and a grad ual withdrawal of the steroid are indicated. Systemic side effects are possible if the percutane ous penetration of the topical corticosteroid is enhanced, e.g. by occlusion, in intertriginous skin regions, or during acute skin affection where the skin barrier is highly damaged. The worst case can result in an adrenocortical suppression and in a cushing-syndrome, which, however, is very rare and has been reported only with very potent corticosteroids [185]. Contraindications for a therapy with rosacea, perioral dermatitis, urticaria , corticosteroid pregnancy, and breast feeding. 5.

The compound is almost insoluble in water and more easily soluble in organic solvents. Table 5-3 displays its chemical structure and the solubility in different solvents [188]. Table 5-3: Chemical structure of TACA (C 24 H31 FO 6) solubility Triamcinolone acetonide (TACA) Solubility [mg/ml] 0.04 25 chloroform 40 isopropyl alcohol 50 95% ethanol 90 acetone MW 434.5 250 dimethylformami de The acetonide group protects oxidative degradation by epidermal enzymes [189]. Absorbed TACA is extensively metabolized in the er (6 -hydroxy-TACA, 21-carboxy-6 - hydroxy-TACA, 21-carboxy-TACA) by the kidney (85% as metabolites, 15% unchanged) and, to a minor extent, by the bile [190]. Application regimen The efficacy of corticosteroids depends on several factors. The most relevant are: the concentration of the applied formulation (and simul taneously the applied dose), the frequency of application, the potency of the corticosteroid, the properties of the vehicle (e.g., occlusive, emollient, drying, volatile), the application condi tions (e.g., under occlusion or extreme rubbing), the contact time, and the skin disease [191]. The e ffect of concentration, application frequency, and occlusion on the percutaneous penetration and t he efficacy of low dose topical corticosteroids are outlined in detail in chapters 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4, and were investigated experimentally in Projects II, III, and IV. First, an overview of different application regimens is given. In current dermatopharmacotherapy, a step-down therapy is generally advised (Fig. 5-1). The treatment of an acute dermatosis should begin with a potent corticosteroid (class III, occasionally class IV) until a good clinical respon se is observed. Then, the potent corticosteroid can be replaced with a moderately potent (class II) one, and finally a mildly potent (class I) can be used. This procedure prevents local side effects and rebound [192]. OCH3CH3 OHOH OO CH3CH3O F5. Topical glucocorticosteroids Carolina Pellanda Page 36 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Fig. 5-1: Therapy scheme of topical corticosteroids . Step-down and interval therapy (modified from Hat z [192]). A valuable alternative is the interval therapy (Fig. 5-1). Instead of abruptly stopping the therapy, corticosteroid-free intervals during which only the cream base is used are alternated with the corticosteroid applications [192]. The dur ation of the corticosteroid-free intervals can be quite variable, and every-other-day (alternate-day) , twice-weekly, or weekend-only (pulse therapy) [193]. In a double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, bilateral-paired h 32 psoriatic patients treated with betamethasone dipropionate cream, Singh did not obs erved any significant difference between alternate-day vs. once-daily corticosteroid applica tions. On the contrary, the application every third day or weekly was less effective than the onc e-daily application [194]. In patients suffering twice-weekly applicatio n of fluticasone propionate combined with the daily emollient significantly reduced the risk of a relapse, and was thus paradoxically steroid sparing [195]. Corticosteroid applications often follow a tandem therapy : the corticosteroid is alternated with the cream base, for example the corticosteroid is a pplied in the evening, the cream base in the morning. The adjunctive skin care with the cream ba se is of extreme importance in most dermatoses. Moreover, the intermittent steroid appl ication has proved useful in preventing tachyphylaxis, observed after prolonged and intensi ve therapy, especially after multiple-daily applications [196, 197]. A more specific treatment regimen is the topical rotational therapy [198], known especially from the psoriasis treatment: corticosteroid applic ations are alternated with applications of other topical agents (e.g., calcipotriol, tazarotene). Th is offers certain advantages, since monotherapy with topical corticosteroids for psoriasis generall y results in a limited total clearance of the lesions (4-36%) [199]. Singh et al observed that th e use of betamethasone and calcipotriol on alternate weeks was more effective than the daily a pplication of the corticosteroid alone. This new treatment strategy seems to prevent or minimize tachyphylaxis [198]. weeks IV III II I STEP -DOWN THERAPY INTERVAL THERAPY Potency class 5. Topical glucocorticosteroids Carolina Pellanda Page 37 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 5.2. Concentration and dose Pharmacodynamic aspect Potency and efficacy of corticosteroids are usually assessed using the skin blanching assay, which estimates the potency based on the skin white ning side effect due to vasoconstriction [153]. The blanching assay is suited for bioequival ence testing of different proprietary formulations and for efficacy testing of different concentrations of the same glucocorticosteroids in the same vehicle [92]. The dose-response curves obtained by blanching asse ssment of topically applied corticosteroids can usually be divided into 2 parts (Fig. 5-2). The first part displays a relatively steep dose-response relationship where small change s in concentration lead to a high potency increase. The second part displays a rather flat do se-response relationship where large increases in concentration lead only to small chang es in potency. The typical concentration of proprietary corticosteroid formulations usually res ides in the flat, second part of the dose- response curve, and often a 10-to-20-fold dilution is needed to achieve a detectable change in potency [191]. In the case of TACA, the 4-fold dilu tion of different proprietary formulations (0.5%-0.025%) not its efficacy significa ntly [200]. Fig. 5-2 : AUC / concentration curve for a betamethasone valerate ointment. The AUC scores are a measure of the vasoconstrictive potency, and were obtained from blanching response profiles from 7 to 24 h after application of the formulation [191]. For this reason, it could be assumed that marketed corticosteroid formulations contain much more drug than necessary for their efficacy. Actual ly, in clinical practice, proprietary formulations are often diluted with the cream base to decrease t he corticosteroid concentration. The topic concerning the efficacy of low-dose corti costeroid formulations as well as advantages and risks of dilution has been investigated and dis cussed in the experimental section (Project IV: Efficacy of low-dose corticosteroids in atopic dermatitis). 5. Topical glucocorticosteroids Carolina Pellanda Page 38 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Pharmacokinetic aspect Increasing the concentration of the active compound in a topical formulation does increase its percutaneous penetration, provided that the compoun d is dissolved. The relationship between dose applied and absolute absorption can be defined as roughly linear, but only over a finite range. After surpassing the threshold, a surplus of the compound may not be absorbed from the skin because of skin saturation or because of compo und precipitation. In case of skin saturation, the compound diffusion through the skin is not expected to follow Fick's law of diffusion [201, 202]. Wester and hydrocortisone, testosterone, benzoic acid, and nitroglycerine in a wide concentration range (Table 5-4) [203]. After application of a 10-fold increased concentrat ion of hydrocortisone (4 vs. 40 \u00b5g/cm 2), only a 4-fold increase in hydrocortisone absorption was ob served. After application of increasing concentrations of nitroglycerin, the absolute percu taneous absorption increased roughly linearly in the concentration range of 10-7000 \u00b5g/cm 2, but then decreased abruptly at 10000 \u00b5g/cm 2. As shown in Table 5-4, the application of high drug co ncentrations always results in a decreased relative absorption [204]. In contrast, low-dose fo rmulations are absorbed more efficiently (higher relative absorption). Moreover, the saturat ion degree of the drug within the formulation plays a determinant role [196] Table 5-4: Percutaneous absorption of different doses hydrocortisone, testosterone, benzoic acid, and nitroglycerin in the rhesus monkey model and in human volunteers (data for hydrocortisone, testost erone, and benzoic from [205]).

Topical glucocorticosteroids Carolina Pellanda Page 39 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 5.3. Application frequency Pharmacodynamic aspect The application frequency of topical corticosteroid s is a recurrently debated topic. Traditionally, the application of topical corticosteroids followed a multiple-daily scheme, with the application of the product up to 3-4 times a day. Yet, this habit had no scientific basis [206]. Newer guidelines usually recommend once- or twice-daily applications [193], and most clinicians follow the twice- daily application schedule until a clinical respons e is obtained and then reduce the application frequency [179]. Two systematic reviews of atopic dermatitis treatme nt revealed a similar clinical efficacy of once-daily vs. more frequent applications. There wa s no clear evidence to support the multiple- daily corticosteroid use [207, 208]. In a review in volving both atopic dermatitis and psoriasis patients, Lagos et al. found no significant differe nce in the treatment response of once vs. twice daily applications with very potent corticosteroids , and no difference or only a slight difference with potent or moderately potent corticosteroids [2 09]. The once-daily application may also be preferable to minimize the risk of side effects and tachyphylaxis [196, 197], to improve patient compliance, and to reduce the therapy costs. The individual circumstances have always to be cons idered to ensure an optimal therapy. Relevant factors determining the choice of applicat ion frequency are: the severity, localization, and type of the dermatosis, as well as the potency and type of the corticosteroid. Whereas once-daily applications may be sufficient to cure m ild or moderate skin affections, a more frequent application might be needed in severe form s to achieve a higher total clearance of the lesions [210] and an accelerated onset of action [2 11-213]. Severe psoriasis, for example, may require a more frequent application compared to ato pic dermatitis [214]. For very potent corticosteroids, once-daily applications are usuall y recommended, and the \"once-daily\" preparations. Table 5-5 gives an overview of the most important p harmacodynamic studies comparing the treatment efficacy of once-daily and multiple-daily applications of the same corticosteroid formulation. The once-daily application schedule al ways followed the tandem therapy (see chapter 5.1), with applications of the corticostero id in the evening alternating with applications of an emollient in the morning and in the afternoon. O n the whole, the results show that a once- daily application can be as effective as multiple-d aily applications, but that a twice- or thrice- daily application may accelerate the onset of actio n. The adjunctive skin care with emollients increases the efficacy of the treatment and has ste roid-sparing quality [199, 219]. 5. Topical glucocorticosteroids Carolina Pellanda Page 40 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Table 5-5: Overview of the pharmacodynamic studies investigating the efficacy of once-daily vs. multip le-daily topical corticosteroid applications.

Topical glucocorticosteroids Carolina Pellanda Page 41 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Pharmacokinetic aspect Only few pharmacokinetic studies investigating mult iple applications have been performed. Most of these studies draw their conclusions from d ata derived from drug concentration determination in plasma [222, 223] and urine [224, 225]. This means that percutaneous absorption and thus systemic, not topical bioavaila bility, is measured. Melendres et al. investigated the effect of applica tion frequency on the percutaneous absorption of 14 C-labeled hydrocortisone applied in acetone in huma n volunteers. The study compared a single low dose (1x13.3 \u00b5g/cm 2) to a threefold higher dose, applied either as a s ingle dose (1x40 \u00b5g/cm 2) or as multiple doses (3x13.3 \u00b5g/cm 2). Percutaneous absorption was assessed by measurement of the urinary excretion over 7 days. A 3-fold increase in dose was supposed to yield a 3-fold increase in absorption. This turned out to be correct for application of the single high dose (1x40 \u00b5g/cm 2). Yet, the multiple application (3x13.3 \u00b5g/cm 2) resulted in a percutaneous absorption much higher than expected ( Fig. 5-3), as well as in higher drug amounts within the stratum corneum [225]. A similar trend was obtained after hydrocortisone a pplication in a cream vehicle. The application of the single high dose (1x40 \u00b5g/cm 2) resulted, as expected, in a percutaneous absorpti on 3 times higher compared to the single low dose (1x13. 3 \u00b5g/cm 2). Again, the multiple application (3x13.3 \u00b5g/cm 2) resulted in an unexpected higher percutaneous abs orption (Fig. 5-3) [226]. Fig. 5-3: Effect of application frequency on the percutaneous absorption of hydro- cortisone applied on the forearm of human volunteers as an acetonic solution (data from [225]) and a cream (data from [226]. The percutaneous absorption was assessed as the total amount excreted in the urine over 7 days. Investigations on the percutaneous absorption of hy drocortisone [224], testosterone, not consi stent with human in vivo studies performed with the same design. Therefore, in some cases, the extrapolation of results obtained from animal studies to estimate percutaneous penetration in humans may be inappropriate. The effect of application frequency on the in vivo penetration of TACA into stratum corneum was investigated in human volunteers in the experim ental section, Project II: Effect of dose and application frequency.

Occlusion Pharmacodynamic aspect Occlusion is a simple method for enhancing the effi cacy of topically applied drugs in clinical practice. The general effects of occlusion on the s kin and on percutaneous absorption have already been described in chapter 2.4.4. An increas ed clinical efficacy of topical drugs under occlusion was first documented in 1960 by Garb with podophyllin (applied for the treatment of the naevus verrucosus) [228]. An enhanced efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of psoriasis was then observed for fluocinolone aceton ide [229, 230] and hydrocortisone [231] applied under The combination of topical ly applied calcipotriol plus occlusion for the treatment of psoriasis resulted as well in a signif icantly higher improvement of the lesion compared to calcipotriol or occlusion alone [232]. Interestingly, occlusion alone (without application of any topical formulation) also induce d a significant improvement of psoriatic lesions which was comparable with the effect of flu ocinolone acetonide [230]. The introduction of the McKenzie-Stoughton vasocons triction enabled the correlation of a pharmacodynamic endpoint (the vasoconstriction) wit h the efficacy of topical corticosteroids, and showed that the application of corticosteroids under occlusion clearly induced a higher vasoconstrictive response compared to non-occluded applications [153]. Pharmacokinetic aspect absorption of different ( estradiol, testosterone, progesterone) after application under occluded and non-occluded conditions was investigated by Bucks et al. [233, 234]. The percutaneous absorp tion was significantly occlusion estradiol, testosterone, and progeste rone but not for hydrocortisone, the most hydrophilic steroid in this experiment. A linear tr end of occlusion-induced absorption- enhancement with increasing compound lipophilicity was observed except for progesterone (the most lipophilic compound in the array). Similar res ults were obtained after application of different phenols: occlusion significantly increase d the percutaneous absorption of some (the more lipophilic) but not of all phenols. The least effect of occlusion was encountered with the more hydrophilic phenols [52]. Treffel et al. inves tigated in percutaneous abso rption of citropten (a lipophilic compound) by a factor of 1.6, whereas the absorptio n of caffeine (an amphiphilic compound) remained unaffected [73]. Thus, occlusion seems to have a higher effect on percutaneous penetration and absorption for lipophilic compounds and less for hydrophilic compounds. The hydration of the normally lipophilic stratum corneu m during occlusion alters the partitioning of the applied compound between stratum corneum and th e hydrophilic viable epidermis. 5. Topical glucocorticosteroids Carolina Pellanda Page 43 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 The absorption enhancement encountered during occlu sion appears to be dependent not only on the compound but also on the vehicle and on the material of the occlusive device. Cross and Roberts observed a clear penetration enhancement of parabens after application in volatile solvents (acetone, ethanol) under occlusion, wherea s the occlusive application of an ointment resulted in a retardation of penetration. Depending on the vehicle, occlusion had significantly different effects on both partitioning and epiderma l diffusivity. Moreover, occlusion of the volatile vehicles prevented their evaporation, and the solve nts may have loosened the barrier of the stratum corneum by extracting intercellular lipids [235]. The material of the occlusive device seems to play a decisive role as well, since differ ent materials display different water vapor permeability (Table 5-6) [68, 236].

As described in chapter 4, the formation, the exten t, and the duration of a reservoir are highly favorized by application of the compound under occl usion [148]. After removal of the occlusive wrap, the hydration level of the stratum corneum ra pidly returns to normal levels, and so does the facilitated partitioning between stratum corneu m (hydrated by occlusion) and epidermis (hydrophilic). Thus, topically applied compounds re main temporarily trapped within the stratum corneum, forming a reservoir. In the case of TACA, Carr and Wieland observed an accumulation of a double amount of 14 C-labeled triamcinolone acetonide within the stratu m corneum after occlusion compared to non-occluded sk in sites [152]. The effect of occlusion on the in vivo penetration of unlabeled TACA into human stratum corneum was investigated in the experimental sectio n, Project III: Effect of occlusion. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 47 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and proof of concept Abstract The aim of the investigations described in this cha pter was to develope and validate a method set for the in vivo quantification of TACA in human stratum corneum by means of: 1) tape stripping as sampling method, 2) UV/VIS-spectroscop y for the quantification of corneocytes, and 3) HPLC for the quantification of TACA. A standardized tape stripping protocol was develope d and included the use of a template (ensures the removal of stratum corneum samples fro m the same skin site) and a hand roller (ensures a constant pressure on the tape before str ipping), and, most importantly, the removal of the entire stratum corneum of one skin site to c ope with inter- and intra-individual differences in stratum corneum thickness. The UV/VIS-spectrosco pical method for quantification of the corneocytes had been previously validated and was a dopted. The HPLC method for TACA quantification was developed and validated accordin g to ICH Guidelines. The analytical challenge consisted in the development of a sensiti ve analytical method capable to quantify low amounts of TACA distributed on single tapes after e xtraction. The HPLC method was successfully validated and proved to have suitable specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and robustness in the working range. The LOQ of 0.1 \u00b5g/ ml enabled the quantification of 27 ng/cm 2 TACA on single tapes. The method set was then applied in a proof of conce pt performed with 6 healthy volunteers. TACA (100 \u00b5g/cm 2) was applied either as an acetonic solution or as an ethanolic gel. Stratum corneum samples were taken 0.5 h, 3h, and 24 h late r by standardized tape stripping. Whereas the TACA penetration from the acetonic solution was high and TACA reached deeper layers of the stratum corneum, the TACA penetration from the ethanolic gel was only superficial, most TACA being retained within the cellulose matrix of the gel after evaporation of the solvent. The proof of concept proved the suitability of the meth ods to distinguish between different penetration patterns of TACA.

Introduction Specific and sensitive analytical methods for the q uantitative evaluation of drugs are decisive for the successful execution of preclinical and clinica l trials. To demonstrate the suitability of a bioanalytical method for the intended use and to en sure reliable and reproducible results, validation of the methodology is required [237, 238 ]. Tape stripping is a sampling method which enables t he removal of the stratum corneum layer by layer [93]. The amount of stratum corneum remove d is influenced by several factors, e.g. the type of tape and the pressure applied on the tape b efore stripping [131], the topical formulation (vehicle effects) [93], and the skin site [6, 127, 239]. Thus, a standardized methodology and a critical evaluation of the results are essential. A fter stratum corneum sampling, the quantification of corneocytes and the quantification of drug adher ing to the tapes are both required to assess the penetration of a drug into the stratum corneum. For the quantification of corneocytes, different me thods have been described [240-243]. The time consuming gravimetric method has been the conv entional method over years. However, the mass of corneocytes is usually overestimated be cause of additional weight caused either by exogenous and endogenous substances like excess of formulation, sebum, and sweat [134] or by interferences caused by electrostatic charge. In addition, this method has to be combined with measurements reflecting the disruption status of the stratum corneum barrier, e.g. by TEWL, and thus indirectly reflecting the stratum co rneum thickness. Recently, TEWL measurements have been shown not to be sensitive en ough for the measurement of small changes in stratum corneum thickness [244]. Moreove r, an estimation of the stratum corneum density is required and usually arbitrarily set at 1 g/cm 3 [131, 243]. Dreher et al. proposed a colorimetric assay (modified Lowry total protein as say) for quantification of the stratum corneum proteins extracted from the tapes, stained, and mea sured spectroscopically at 750 nm. The method was shown to be an accurate and reproducible alternative to the gravimetric method [240, 241]. Nevertheless, the quantification of the stratum corneum proteins directly on the tapes would be simpler and faster. Marttin et al. p roposed a spectroscopic method based on the protein absorption at 278 nm. Unfortunately, this m ethod turned out to be less reliable than the gravimetric method, since the light scattering effe cts caused by the corneocytes on the tape overshadowed the weak absorption of the proteins. E ven an additional protein staining with Brilliant Blue did not improve the quantification [ 242]. Weigmann et al. proposed a novel method based on a spectroscopical measurement of the pseudo-absorption of corneocytes in the visible ran ge. The pseudo-absorption was defined as the decrease in light transmission due to reflectio n, diffraction, and scattering by the corneocytes aggregates. The pseudo-absorption is ne arly independent of the wavelength and was arbitrarily set at 430 nm, whereas all other co mponents on the tapes usually absorb in the UV range [134]. The comparison of the novel spectro scopical method with established methods 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 49 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 has shown that UV/VIS-spectroscopy allows rapid, ac curate, and reproducible quantification of corneocytes removed by tape stripping [245, 246]. For the quantification of drugs, HPLC represents a simple and common analytical method which, nevertheless, requires validation to prove s pecificity, accuracy, precision, and robustness in the working range. The analytical challenge conc erns the development of a method capable of quantifying low drug amounts distributed on seve ral tapes without the necessity of pooling the tapes. The aim of the investigations described in this cha pter is the validation of an HPLC method for the quantification of TACA, a moderately potent cor ticosteroid, on tape strips removed by tape stripping after topical application of a TACA formu lation. The combination of: 1) the standardized tape stripping as sampling method, 2) the UV/VIS-spectroscopical method for quantification of corneocytes validated by Weigmann et al. [245], and 3) the new validated HPLC method for quantification of TACA, is then app lied to a preliminary investigation (proof of concept). For this purpose, the TACA penetration in to human stratum corneum was assessed in vivo after application of TACA in two different vehicle s (acetonic solution, ethanolic gel). 6.2. Materials and methods 6.2.1. Material and formulations Micronized TACA Ph.Eur. was Ph.Eur. from H\u00e4nsel er AG, Herisau, Switzerland. HPLC grade methanol was obtained from Scharlau Chemie S. A., Barcelona, Spain. Water was purified by reverse osmosis (Osmostil LN 4/2 PH - S petron 500 PH, Christ Aqua Ecolife AG, Aesch, Switzerland). Because of the low solubility of TACA in methanol 6 0% (v/v), a stock solution of 2 mg/ml TACA in methanol 100% was prepared. TACA solutions of di fferent concentrations were then diluted from the stock solution with methanol 60% (v/v). For topical application, two TACA formulations were prepared: an acetonic solution (TACA 2 6.

Validation of the HPLC method Chromatographic conditions TACA was quantified by HPLC using a Waters Alliance HPLC System (2690 Separation Module, 996 Photodiode Array Detector, Millenium 32 Software), all Waters Corporation, Millford, Massachusetts, USA. An overview of the chromatograp hic conditions is given in Table 6-1. Table 6-1: Chromatographic conditions of the HPLC m ethod for TACA quantification.

Spec ificity, limit of detection and quantification, linearity and range, accuracy, precision (repeatabi lity and intermediate precision), and robustness were assessed. The method of assessment of each validation parameter is presented together with the definition, results, an d discussion in chapter 6.3. The MVA software (Method Validation in Analytics, Novia Gm bH, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany), specifically designed for the calculation of valida tion data and based on the ICH-guidelines, was used to conduct the statistical tests. Tape spiking and tape extraction Tape spiking was performed to determine specificity and accuracy. A solution volume of 50 \u00b5l was applied with a Hamilton Syringe (250 \u00b5L, 22/2''/2, Supelco, Buchs, Switzerland) on the adhesive side of tape strips (approximate length of 3 cm). After evaporation of the solvent, each tape was individually placed in a scintillation via l (20 ml, glass, metal-foil sealing, polypropylene lock, VWR International AG, Dietikon, Switzerland) and extracted with 1.5 ml 60% methanol during 30 min on a horizontal shaker at 140 rpm (He idolph Unimax 2010, Heidolph, Germany). 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 51 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 6.2.3. Proof of concept Application of the formulations The experiments were conducted on the volar aspect of the forearm of 6 healthy Caucasian volunteers of skin phototype II-III (4 female and 2 male, aged 22-38 years). The volunteers were divided into 2 groups (Table 6-2), and 3 skin sites per volunteer were treated with 100 \u00b5g/cm 2 TACA delivered either from an acetonic solution (gr oup 1) or from an ethanolic gel (group 2). For the acetonic solution, a skin area of 10.5 cm 2 was delineated by a rectangular glass frame glued onto the skin (Sauer \u00ae skin glue, Manfred Sauer GmbH. Lobbach, Germany). A volume of 500 \u00b5l formulation was uniformly applied with a Hamilton\u00ae Syringe (Supelco, Buchs, Switzerland), and the solvent was allowed to evapor ate. For the ethanolic gel, the application area was delineated by an adhesive template (HAWE \u00ae adhesive film, HAWE, Hugentobler AG, Bern, Switzerland) displaying a rectangular apertur e of 10.5 cm 2. A mass of 100 mg gel was applied with a Gilson Microman pipette (Gilson AG, Mettmenstetten, Switzerland) a nd homogeneously distributed with a glass rod. No skin washing was performed to remove excess of formulation. Table 6-2: Overview of application and tape strippi ng procedure during the proof of concept experiment s. The two TACA formulations (acetonic solution, ethanolic gel) were applied on 3 sites per arm (time 0 h, at 9 a.m.). Tape stripping followed at 3 different times (0.5 h , 3 h, 24 h).

In order to remove the skin in a stand ardized way from the same skin area, a laminated paper template (protective film of HAWE \u00ae adhesive film, HAWE, Hugentobler AG, Bern, Switzerland) delineating a constant aperture of 3.3 x 1.7 cm (5.6 cm 2) was fixed onto the application area with adhesive tape. Tape stripping was carried out with Tesa tape (Tesa Multi- Film Crystal-Clear No. 57315, 19 mm width, Tesa, Beiersdorf, Hamburg, Germany). A hand roller supplying a pressure of 140 g/cm 2 was uniformly passed over the tapes 10 times for e ach stripping. Each tape was removed with a rapid, firm movement, and then fixed across a photographic slide frame, the adhering corneocytes being exposed through the frame aperture. 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 52 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 This procedure was repeated with new tapes, alterna ting the direction of tape removal (elbow- to-wrist, wrist-to-elbow). The endpoint of tape stripping (total stratum corne um removal) was determined by UV/VIS- spectroscopy. When the amount of corneocytes adheri ng to the stripped tapes started to decrease macroscopically, the tapes were periodical ly measured as described below. As soon as transmission values 95% (calculated from the absorbance values and def ined as complete removal of the stratum corneum) were attained, tape stripping was stopped. Quantification of corneocytes by UV/VIS-spectroscop y The amount of corneocytes adhering to each tape was quantified by measuring the pseudo- absorbance of the corneocytes at 430 nm as describe d in Weigmann et al. [245]. Each tape was directly measured against a blank tape in a Lam bda 35 spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, \u00dcberlingen, Germany), custom-modified to obtain a r ectangular light beam of 1 cm 2. Blank tapes were sequentially sampled from the stock roll of Tesa tape after every fifth stripping, allowing a continuous correction for any irregulari ties in the optical properties of the tape from the start to the end of the roll. A solid-sample ho lder allowed a direct positioning of the photographic slide frame into the spectrophotometer . Continuous spectra of each tape were recorded between 400-500 nm, and absorbance values at 430 nm were extracted for quantification of the corneocytes. Quantification of TACA by HPLC After quantification of the corneocytes, each tape was individually extracted with 1.5 ml 60% methanol during 30 min on a horizontal shaker at 14 0 rpm (Heidolph Unimax 2010, Heidolph, Germany). TACA concentrations in the extract were q uantified by the validated HPLC method described in chapter 6.2.2. Data analysis Qualitative TACA penetration into stratum corneum: penetration profiles To localize the drug within the stratum corneum, TA CA concentrations quantified on each tape were correlated to the tape number and to the depth of penetration into stratum corneum. Removal of the entire stratum corneum is a prerequi site for the profile calculation, as the total sum of corneocytes-(pseudo-)absorbance on one skin site (cumulative absorbance) represents 100% stratum corneum thickness. Thus, the relative amount of stratum corneum removed by each tape could be calculated from the individual c orneocyte absorbance values as depicted in Fig. 6-1 [126]. To depict the penetration profiles, a Macro was programmed in Microsoft \u00ae Excel. Mean and standard deviation of the number of tapes required to remove the entire stratum corneum were calculated. 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 53 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Fig. 6-1: Calculation of the penetration profiles. The pseudo-absorbance of the corneocytes on each tape is summed up to the cumulative absorbance values. The total cumulated absorbance (3.57 in this example) corresponds to 100% stratum corneum. From this value, the relative stratum corneum thickness can be deducted. After Jacobi et al. [126]. Quantitative TACA penetration into stratum corneum The TACA amount on each tape of one skin site was a dded up to obtain the total TACA amount penetrated into stratum corneum. The total TACA amo unts were then evaluated statistically. The difference between the treatment groups at each stripping time was tested in a 2-sided t- test ( = 0.05). Two different types of evaluation were pe rformed: the evaluation of a) the total TACA amount penetrated into the stratum corneum (su m of TACA amounts on all tapes), and b) the TACA amount without tapes 1-3 (on which formula tion excess, e.g. TACA crystals and a thin gel film, could be located). Statgraphics PLUS 5 software (Manugistic, Inc., Rockville, Maryland, USA) was used to conduct the statistical analysis. Raster-electron-microscopic (REM) recording Selected stripped tapes with adhering corneocytes a nd drug were observed with a Philips XL 30 ESEM scanning electron microscope. Sample preparati on included fixation on a metal cylinder with a carbon adhesive tape and sputtering with gol d (20 nm). 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 54 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 6.3. Validation of the HPLC method 6.3.1. Specificity Definition Specificity is the ability to unequivocally assess the analyte in the presence of components which may be expected to be present. Typically, thi s might include impurities, degradants, and matrix [237]. Method To determine the retention time of TACA, a methanol ic TACA solution (0.5 \u00b5g/ml) was assayed by HPLC (n = 3). Then, all the components which cou ld possibly interact with the TACA peak, namely solvents (methanol 60%, acetone), tape matri x (e.g., polymer, adhesive), and stratum corneum constituents were individually assayed (eac h n = 3). The solvents were directly injected into the HPLC system. To obtain tape matri x samples, tape strips (n=3) were extracted by the standard extraction procedure described in c hapter 6.2.2. To obtain stratum corneum constituents samples, tape strips (n=3) were placed on and peeled off the forearm skin of a healthy volunteer and were then extracted. The rela tive retention times were determined, and the chromatograms were visually searched for peak o verlay of any component with the TACA peak. In addition, tape strips of about 3 cm length were spiked with TACA solution following the standard spiking procedure described in chapter 6.2 .2. A low (15 \u00b5g/ml) and a high (450 \u00b5g/ml) concentrated methanolic TACA solution was used as s piking solution (n=3 for each concentration). The spiking procedure was repeated with tape strips previously peeled off the forearm skin of a healthy volunteer (n=3 for each c oncentration). After evaporation of the solvent, the tapes were extracted, and the extracts were assayed by HPLC. Results and discussion Fig. 6-2 displays the chromatograms of methanol 60% , TACA solution (0.5 \u00b5g/ml), tape extract, and the extract of a spiked tape. The relative rete ntion time (R t) of TACA was 2.9 min, with the absorption maximum at 243.8 nm. The following addit ional peaks were recorded: methanol at 2.0 min and tape matrix at 1.0 min, 4.8 min, and 5. 4 min. The relative R t of acetone was 1.3 min and did not interfere with the TACA peak. Acetone i s not expected to be present in the extracts, as it evaporates completely after application. The extract of tapes with and without adhering corneocytes resulted in identical chromatograms, in dicating that stratum corneum constituents are not interfering in this wavelength range. No in terference between the TACA peak and any other peak could be observed, assuring the specific ity of the method for TACA. 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 55 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Fig. 6-2: Chromatograms for specificity evaluation: A) Methanol 60% (R t 2.0 min), B) TACA solution 0.5 \u00b5\u00b5 \u00b5\u00b5g/ml (TACA R t 2.9 min), C) Tape extract (tape matrix R t 1.0 min, 4.8 min, 5.4 min), D) extract of a tape w ith corneocytes spiked with TACA solution (15 \u00b5\u00b5 \u00b5\u00b5g/ml). 6.3.2. detection (LOD) and Limit of quanti fication (LOQ) Definitions The limit of detection (LOD) of an analytical procedure is the lowest amount of analyte in a sample which can be detected but not necessarily qu antitated as an exact value. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of an analytical procedure is the lowest amount of analyte in a sample which can be quantitatively determined with suitabl e precision and accuracy [237]. Method LOD and LOQ were assessed by calculating the signal -to-noise ratios from the chromatograms. The signal is defined as the height of the peak of interest (i n this case the TACA peak), and the noise as the height of the baseline. The LOD was determi ned by diluting TACA solutions until a signal-to-noise ratio of 3-to-1 was obtained (n = 6), the LOQ until the sig nal-to-noise ratio was 10-to-1 (n = 6). The deviation of the LOQ signals should not exceed 20%, as described in chapter 6.3.3, Linearity and Range [238]. Results and discussion The following signal-to-noise ratios were achieved for different TACA solutions: 2.8\u00b10.2 to for a TACA for a ion of 0.1 \u00b5g/ml (n=6). Therefore, the LOD was set at 0.035 \u00b5g/ml (corresponding to a TACA amount of 9 ng/cm 2 on the tape) and the LOQ at 0.1 \u00b5g/ml (corresponding to 27 ng/cm 2). The deviation of the LOQ signals calculated with the linear weighted model was < 4%, thus not e xceeding the maximal allowed value of 20% (compare chapter 6.3.3). The accuracy (chapter 6.3. 4) and precision (chapter 6.3.5) achieved at LOQ were considered suitable.

Linearity and Range Definitions The linearity of an analytical procedure is its ability, within a given range, to obtain test results which are directly proportional to the concentratio n or the amount of an analyte in the sample. The range of an analytical procedure is the interval between the upper and lower concentration or amount of analyte in the sample, including those concentrations for which it has been demonstrated that the analytical procedure has a su itable level of precision, accuracy, and linearity [237]. Method Standard TACA solutions 0.1 \u00b5g/ml. Each standard solution was assayed 5 times by HPLC. The measured signals (peak area) w ere plotted as a function of analyte concentration. The procedure was repeated on 3 diff erent days with new standard solutions, yielding a total of 3 calibration curves. To determine the model best describing the obtained calibration curves, the function of the 3 curves was calculated with following regression mod els: a) the linear unweighted model, b) the linear weighted model (weighting factor 1/x, where x = concentration), and c) the nonlinear (quadratic) model. The function, the correlation co efficient, the standard error of the slope (s x0 ), the residual sum of square (SS), the residual stand ard deviation (SD), and the residual variance were calculated for each model [248]. Variance-homogeneity of the signals over the whole working range is a prerequisite for linear regression [249] and was tested in a Cochran test u sing peak-area data. If the signal variances displayed homogeneity, the residual variance of the linear regression models (both unweighted and weighted) could be tested against the non-linea r model in a Mandel test [248, 250]. The best suitable model was chosen for TACA quantificat ion. In addition, an analysis of the residuals was performed separately for each concent ration level, with a maximal accepted deviation of 20% for the lowest concentration (LOQ) and 15% for the other concentrations [238]. Results and discussion The key data of the 3 curves calculated with the di fferent regression models are listed in Table 6-3. The correlation coefficient was good in all th e models, but the evaluation of the simple correlation coefficient is a poor measure of the cu rve-fit quality of the data. The standard error of the slope (s x0 ), representing the standard deviation of the proce dure, displayed lower values with the linear unweighted model compared to the li near weighted model. However, the lowest residual variance was achieved with the linear weig hted model. 6.

Thus, the Mandel test could be performed, and the comparison of the linear models (unweighted/weighted) with the non-li near model resulted in a best fit achieved by the linear regression models. To choose the best model between the linear unweigh ted and the linear weighted model, a residual analysis was performed for each concentrat ion level of the curve. The values are summarized in Table 6-4. The residues displayed a n ormal distribution in all the models and randomly scattered around the zero line. The lowest concentration level (0.1 \u00b5g/m = LOQ) showed the highest residues with maximal values of 25% (linear unweighted model), 18% (non- linear model), and 4% (linear weighted model). The residues of the other concentration levels displayed maximal values of 1.2% (linear weighted m odel), 1.0% (linear unweighted model), and 0.8% (non-linear model). Table 6-4: Mean percentage residual variance of the different concentration levels calculated with the linear unweighted, the linear weighted, and the non-linear model.

The weighting of the ca libration with the reciprocal of concentration (1/x) enables the curve adjustment to the lower con centration levels. The range for TACA quantification was set at 0.1-20.0 \u00b5g/ml. 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 58 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 6.3.4. Accuracy by recovery Definitions The accuracy of an analytical procedure expresses the closeness of agreement between the value which is accepted either as a conventional tr ue value or an accepted reference value, and the experimental value [237]. Methods The accuracy was evaluated in terms of recovery. Fo r this purpose, tapes with adhering corneocytes were spiked with known amounts of TACA, extracted and assayed by HPLC. The measured TACA amount was then compared to the effec tive spiked TACA amount. To obtain tapes with adhering corneocytes, a skin area of 5.6 cm 2 on the forearm of a healthy volunteer was delineated by a template. A total of 18 tapes w as subsequently applied and removed from this skin area. The tapes were then divided into 3 groups of 6 tapes each and spiked with 50 \u00b5l of the following methanolic TACA solutions: tape 1- 6 with 450 \u00b5g/ml (corresponding to a high concentration level of 15 \u00b5g/ml on the calibration curve), tape 7-12 with 150 \u00b5g/ml (middle concentration level of 5 \u00b5g/ml) and tapes 13-18 with 15 \u00b5g/ml (low concentration level of 0.5 \u00b5g/ml). After evaporation of the solvent, each tape was extracted by the standard extraction procedure described in chapter 6.2.2. The extracts were assayed by HPLC and the data processed with the linear weighted (1/x) regression model to obtain recovery values. An accurate method should achieve recoveries of 80-120 % [238]. Results and discussion All the recovery values are displayed in the append ix (Table 11-1). The recovery was very good in the higher and middle calibration range (15 \u00b5g/ml and 5 \u00b5g/ml) with mean recovery values of 97 \u00b1 2% (ranging from 94% to 99%) and 94 \u00b1 (from 91% to 96%), respectively. In the lower calibration range (0.5 \u00b5g/ml), the mean recovery displayed values of 87 \u00b1 4% (from 82% to 92%). The overall experimental recovery ranged from 82% to 99%, thus fulfilling the requirements for accuracy (80-120%). 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 59 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 6.3.5. Precision Definitions The precision of an analytical procedure expresses the closeness of agreement (degree of scatter) between a series of measurements obtained from multiple sampling of the same homogenous sample under the prescribed conditions. Precision may be considered at 3 levels: repeatability, intermediate precision, and reproduc ibility. Repeatability expresses the precision under the same operating conditions over a short in terval of time (intra-assay precision). Intermediate precision expresses within-laboratories variations (e.g., di fferent days, different analysts, or different equipment). Reproducibility expresses the precision between laboratories. The precision of an analytical procedure is usually expressed as the variance, standard deviation and relative standard deviation (coeffici ent of variation) of a series of measurements. A minimum of 3 concentration levels and 3 replicate s each are required to assess repeatability [237]. Methods Repeatability was evaluated together with linearity , using the same data measured for the calculation of the 3 calibration curves. Absolute a nd relative standard deviations of the peak area were calculated for each concentration level o f the calibration curve (n = 5 for each concentration level). A relative standard deviation of 15% was required except for LOQ, for which a relative standard deviation of 20% was accepted [238]. Repeatability and intermediate precision were calcu lated using the normalized peak areas (peak area divided by the respective concentration value) in the range with and without LOQ. The homogeneity of variance was tested in a Cochran test, and a variance analysis (ANOVA) was performed. Repeatability was defined as: s= (Equation 6) sr2 being the intra-serial variance and x being the overall mean. Intermediate precision was defined as: (Equation 7) sR2 being the overall variance (sum of intra- and inter -serial variances). Reproducibility was not assessed, since the method was designed fo r use within the same laboratory on the same HPLC apparatus. 100 x2 RRCV s=6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 60 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Results and discussion The peak area data for the different concentration levels are displayed in Table 6-5 (the complete data set is listed in the appendix, Table 11-2). The relative standard deviation of all the values excluding LOQ was 2% ( 15% required). At LOQ, a standard ( 10%) was measured ( 20% required). Thus, repeatability was defined as good in the range of 0.1-20 \u00b5g/ml.

If LOQ was included in the cal culation, a value of 5.15% was obtained for both precision types, indicating that precision at LOQ was not optimal, but acceptable.

Robustness Definitions The robustness of an analytical procedure is a measure of its cap acity to remain unaffected by small, but deliberate variations in method paramete rs, and provides an indication of its reliability during normal usage [237]. Method To evaluate method robustness, several method param eters were varied: \u00b1 5% methanol 55%, methanol 65%), \u00b1 5% 40\u00b0C) and \u00b1 2 nm variation of the detection wavelength (238 nm, 242 nm). The extr action solutions used for accuracy evaluation were measured under these modified condi tions (n = 6 per concentration). Recovery values of 80%-120% were aimed at [238]. Results and discussion The variation of chromatographic and analytical con ditions resulted in an overall mean recovery (\u00b1 SD) of: 96.0 \u00b1 1.2% in the higher bration curve (15 \u00b5g/ml), 93.0 \u00b1 2.2% range (5 \u00b5g/ml), and 81.9 \u00b1 9.7% in the lower concentration range (0.5 \u00b5g/ml). The mean recoveries obtained after variation of the different method parameters are depicted in Fig. 6-3. In part icular, the variation in the mobile phase composition (methanol 65%) resulted in recoveries b elow 80% (70.2% to 82.2%) in the lower concentration range. Except for these unsatisfactor y values, the recovery for all other parameters in the low range was 81-87%. The robustness of the method was good in the mid an d high concentration range but limited in the lower concentration range. The results were con sidered acceptable provided that the composition of the mobile phase is periodically che cked.

Overview of the validation The HPLC method was successfully validated and prov ed to have suitable specificity, accuracy, precision, and robustness in the linear range of 0. 1-20 \u00b5g/ml. The calibration curves were calculated with the linear weighted regression mode l, weighting factor 1/x (where x = concentration). The LOQ of 0.1 \u00b5g/ml enabled the quantification of corresponding concentrations of 27 ng/cm 2 TACA on each stripped tape, whereas the LOD of 0.03 5 \u00b5g/ml enabled the detection of 9 ng/cm 2 TACA.

Proof of concept 6.4.1. Qualitative TACA penetration into stratum co rneum: penetration profiles Typical profiles of TACA penetration into stratum c orneum over time are depicted in Fig. 6-4 (the entire set of profiles is displayed in the app endix, chapter 11.1.2). A clear vehicle effect can be observed: after application of the acetonic solu tion, TACA quickly penetrated and permeated the stratum corneum, reaching deeper skin layers. I n contrast, the ethanolic gel formed a superficial film in which considerable TACA amounts remained trapped. This film was removed with the first stripped tape.

Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 64 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 The mean tape number required to remove the entire stratum corneum was 56 \u00b1 17 after application of the acetonic solution and 40 \u00b1 5 after application of the alcoholic gel (Table 6- 8). The intra-individual variability in the number of t apes used to remove the stratum corneum was low, but inter-individual differences were high. Th is is not unusual and has to be taken into account when drug penetration into stratum corneum is investigated.

Quantitative TACA penetration into stratum c orneum A high amount of TACA was always recovered on the f irst stripped tapes, which also removed a large amount of corneocytes. On the skin surface no t only corneocytes but also TACA crystals (in case of the acetonic solution) and a thin gel f ilm (in case of the ethanolic gel) could be discerned. The TACA amounts penetrated into stratum corneum af ter application of the two different formulations are displayed in Fig. 6-5, and the ind ividual data are listed in the appendix (Table 11-3). If all tapes were considered, a significantl y higher TACA amount was recovered within the stratum corneum after application of the ethano lic gel compared to the acetonic solution (94 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 24 \u00b5g/cm 2 at 0.5 h; p < 0.01). Over time, the amount recover ed within the stratum corneum decreased with both formulations. A t 3 h, mean TACA amounts of 84 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 13 \u00b5g/cm 2 (p < 0.01) were recovered after application of the ethanolic gel and the acetonic solution, and at 24 h still 7 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 0.8 \u00b5g/cm 2 (p > 0.05). By excluding tapes 1-3, a statistically higher TACA amount was observed at 0.5 h after application of the acetonic solution (13 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 4 \u00b5g/cm 2; p < 0.01). This inversion of the results, i.e. higher penetration with the ethanolic gel (if all tapes were considered) vs. higher penetration with the acetonic solution (if tapes 1- 3 were discarded), shows that a high TACA amount remained on tapes 1-3. Especially after appl ication of the ethanolic gel, a high TACA amount remained bound to the gel matrix on the skin surface. Thus, the gel can be regarded as 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 65 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 a slow release formulation with a superficial drug reservoir. At 3 h, the penetrated TACA amount after application of the acetonic solution decrease d, whereas the amount was unchanged after application of the ethanolic gel (6 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 4 \u00b5g/cm 2; p > 0.05). At 24 h, TACA amounts of 0.5 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 1.6 \u00b5g/cm 2 (p > 0.05) were measured after application of the a cetonic solution and the ethanolic gel.

The double asterisk (**) denotes a hig hly significant difference (p < 0.01, 2-sided t-test) b etween the formulations at the specified stripping time. 6.4.3. Raster-electron-microscopic (REM) recording Tape stripping does not remove single, homogeneous layers of stratum corneum but rather skin frazzles. This is shown in Fig. 6-6 (A). The use of a hand roller to stretch the skin before stripping the tape from the skin also allowed remov al of the stratum corneum of furrows (Fig. 6-6 B). Single, flat corneocytes can easily b e discerned at higher magnifications, as well as their overlapping (\"imbricated\") arrangement (Fig. 6-6 C, D). TACA crystals precipitated on the skin surface after application of the acetonic solu tion could be observed on some tapes (Fig. 6-6 E, F).

Discussion The set of methods In a first step, the HPLC method for the quantifica tion of TACA on tapes removed by tape stripping was successfully validated. In a second s tep, the whole set of methods, i.e.: 1) the standardized tape stripping technique for stratum c orneum sampling, 2) the UV/VIS-spectrosco- pical method for quantification of corneocytes on t he tapes, and 3) the HPLC method for quantification of TACA on the tapes had to be teste d. The preliminary tape stripping experiments described in this chapter should theref ore be regarded as a proof of concept rather than an in-depth investigation of vehicle effects. The number of volunteers was small, and there was no intra-individual (contra-lateral) comparison of the 2 different formulations. The amount of corneocytes removed by tape stripping is influenced by several factors (described in extenso in chapter 3.2). Therefore, a standardization of t he tape stripping procedure is indispensable to obtain reproducible r esults. Our standardization included: a) the use of a template which ensured the removal of stra tum corneum from the same skin area; b) the application of a constant pressure on the ta pe before stripping by the use of a hand roller; c) the removal of each tape with a rapid, firm move ment; d) the alternation of tape removal (elbow-to-wrist, wrist-to-elbow); and e) the defini tion of a stripping (measured spectrosco-pically). The quantification of corneocytes by UV/VIS-spectro scopy is based on the measurement of the pseudo-absorption of the corneocytes. In contrast t o a real absorption (e.g. shown by sunscreen agents), the corneocytes aggregates, as particles, decrease the intensity of the transmitted light by reflection, scattering, and diffraction [134]. T his happens nearly independently of the wavelength. Therefore, any wavelength which is undi sturbed by other components, e.g. by the applied drug, could be used for quantification of t he corneocytes. In our experiments, the corneocytes were quantified at 430 nm, as already d escribed in the literature [134]. On the skin surface, the corneocyte cohesion is low, and large amounts of corneocytes were removed with the first tapes, displaying high pseudo-absorbance values. In the deeper stratum corneum, the measured pseudo-absorbance decreased, reflecting th e decreasing amount of corneocytes. The UV/VIS-spectroscopical method offers the advant age of a simultaneous quantification of both corneocytes and drug directly on the tape [251 ]. However, this is only possible if the drug has an absorption maximum which is not masked by th e matrix of the tape, i.e. an absorption maximum > 300 nm in the case of Tesa Multi-Film Cry stal-Clear \u00ae (compare Fig. 11-2 of the appendix for a UV/VIS-spectrum of a blank tape). Si nce the absorption maximum of corticosteroids is approximately at 240 nm, the sim ultaneous quantification of corneocytes and corticosteroids is not feasible. Thus, TACA has to be quantified with other methods, e.g. by the HPLC method successfully validated in this chapter. 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 68 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 The validated HPLC method was able to detect TACA o n each stripped tape. Yet, on some of the last stripped tapes (deeper stratum corneum) an d especially 24 h after application, TACA could be detected but not always quantified. In add ition, the sampling of up to 82 tapes to remove the entire stratum corneum in some volunteer s implied a higher TACA \"dilution\" compared to a lower tape number, and the probabilit y to surpass the LOQ was higher. Formulation and vehicle The composition of the applied formulation plays a decisive role on the penetration of drugs into the stratum corneum. The application of a finite am ount of drug was desired, and therefore 2 volatile formulations were compounded: a simple sol ution in acetone as a good solvent for TACA and a lesser volatile ethanolic gel. Acetone d oes not represent a vehicle normally used in dermatology. Yet, the investigation of the penetrat ion of topical corticosteroids applied in acetone is known in the literature, since a volatil e vehicle allows the application of a finite amount of drug [49, 59], and since organic solvents can play a relevant role in occupational skin exposure [61]. Comparisons with older investigation s are possible. Both acetone and ethanol are lipid solvents. The pr operty of dissolving skin lipids, thus causing damage to the normal skin structure, has been descr ibed especially for acetone. In our study, skin damage is improbable, since the applied volume was low and the contact time short (about 30 seconds). At worst, only a superficial skin dama ge due to extraction of skin surface lipids is expected to occurr, whereas the stratum corneum str ucture would remain intact [252, 253]. Skin washing Some authors are used to washing the skin after a d efinite application time to remove eventual excesses of formulation. Yet, different solvents wa sh the skin more or less successfully, and the washing procedure has been related to an enhanced p enetration of the drug into deeper skin layers [224, 225] because of a remobilization of th e drug through the solvent. Moreover, the washing procedure can affect the barrier function o f the skin [254]. To minimalise any additional exogenous influence, no skin washing was performed in these experiments. Tape evaluation The number of tapes required to completely remove t he stratum corneum is dependent on the cohesion of the corneocytes (depending on the volun teer and on the anatomical site), and on the vehicle, which can loosen the structure of the stratum corneum. According to the withdrawn draft guidance \"Topical dermatological drug products NDAs and ANDAs - In vivo bioavailability, bioequivalence, in vitro release, and associated studies\" of the FDA (compare chapter 3.1) [1], some researchers are used to discarding the upper stripped tape from the evaluation, claiming that it contains excess formulation. Yet, discarding tapes is always a precarious and arbitrary procedure, and it is not well defined how many tapes are 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 69 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 sufficient to really eliminate potential formulatio n excesses. Furthermore, drug adhering to the skin can form a surface reservoir, from which the d rug can be released at a later stage if re- dissolved. Instead of discarding tapes, it was preferred for e valuation of the current experiments to present two different types of data. First, the total TACA amount calculated including all the tapes, which gives information about how much drug is in the ent ire stratum corneum, including the drug on the skin surface (e.g. as crystals or bound to the gel matrix). Second, the TACA amount calculated without the tapes 1-3 (usually up to 3 t apes were required to remove TACA crystals), which gives information about the TACA fraction pen etrated into the stratum corneum that is not going to be removed by skin exfoliation and/or fric tion with clothes. TACA penetration into stratum corneum After application of the two different formulations , the vehicles rapidly changed their composition (metamorphosis of the vehicle) [255]. Acetone evapo rated very quickly, and TACA partially precipitated on the skin as a solvent-deposited sol id [49, 59]. After application of the ethanolic gel, the ethanol evaporated as well, but more slowl y. A thin film of gel matrix (mainly cellulose) was macroscopically visible on the skin surface aft er evaporation of the ethanol. Since most TACA was bound within the cellulose matrix, the TAC A penetration into stratum corneum after application of the ethanolic gel formulation was sl ow. The ethanolic gel resulted to be a slow release formulation, forming a superficial drug res ervoir. Therefore, it was important to leave the cellulose film on the skin until tape stripping and not to remove any excess of formulation. The existence of a surface TACA reservoir after app lication of the ethanolic gel is reflected by the high total TACA amount recovered at both 0.5 h (94%) and 3 h (84%). The lower TACA amount recovered at 24 h (7%) can be explained by t he removal of the surface reservoir by textile friction and corneocyte desquamation. Never theless, after 24 h the total TACA amount recovered after application of the ethanolic gel is still higher than the TACA amount after application of the acetonic solution (1%). The acetonic solution displayed a low total penetra ted TACA amount (24%) already at 0.5 h, shortly after application. There are two possible e xplanations: either the acetonic vehicle enhanced the penetration of TACA to such an extent that the drug rapidly permeated through the stratum corneum into deeper, living skin layers (enhanced vertical diffusion), or TACA spread laterally (horizontal diffusion). A 5-fold e nhanced penetration of cortisone after application in an acetonic solution compared to aqu eous solutions was observed by Scheuplein and Ross [59], supporting the enhanced-vertical-pen etration theory. Yet, horizontal diffusion has also been observed in experiments with clobetasol p ropionate applied in different vehicles [123], and the vehicle played a crucial role in inducing l ateral diffusion. Thus, both explanations are possible, although the vertical diffusion was proba bly the predominant route of penetration. 6. Project I: Validation of the methodology and pro of of concept Carolina Pellanda Page 70 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 6.6. Conclusions An HPLC method for quantification of TACA on tapes obtained by tape stripping was validated. The combination of standardized tape stripping as s ampling method and UV/VIS-spectroscopy and HPLC as validated analytical methods enabled th e quantification of the penetration of TACA into human stratum corneum in vivo . This was successfully proven in a preliminary experiment investigating the vehicle effect on the TACA penetration into stratum corneum. The set of methods allowed a clear distinction of the p enetration pattern of TACA after application in an acetonic solution and an ethanolic gel. The etha nolic gel resulted to be a slow-release formulation forming a surface TACA reservoir, where as the acetonic solution displayed a good penetration into the stratum corneum. 7.

Arch Derm Res. The original publication is available at www.springerlink.com. Abstract The application frequency of topical corticosteroid s is a recurrently debated topic. Multiple-daily applications are common, although a superior effica cy compared to a once-daily application is not unequivocally proven. Only few pharmacokinetic studies investigating application frequency exist. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of dose (experiment 1) and application frequency (experiment 2) on the penetration of tria mcinolone acetonide (TACA) into human stratum corneum in vivo . The experiments were conducted on the forearms of 15 healthy volunteers. In experiment 1, single TACA doses (300 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 100 \u00b5g/cm 2) were applied on 3 sites per arm. In experiment 2, single (1x300 \u00b5g/cm 2) and multiple (3x100 \u00b5g/cm 2) TACA doses were similarly applied. Stratum corneum sampl es were harvested by tape stripping after 0.5, 4, 24 h (experiment 1) and after 4, 8, 24 h (e xperiment 2). Corneocytes and TACA were quantified by UV/VIS-spectroscopy and HPLC, respect ively. The amounts of TACA penetrated into stratum corneum were statistically evaluated b y a paired-sample t-test. In experiment 1, TACA amounts within stratum corneum after applicati on of 1x300 \u00b5g/cm 2 compared to 1x100 \u00b5g/cm 2 were only significantly different directly after a pplication and similar at 4 and 24 h. In experiment 2, multiple applications of 3x100 \u00b5g/cm 2 yielded higher TACA amounts compared to a single application of 1x300 \u00b5g/cm 2 at 4 and 8 h. At 24 h, no difference was observed. In conclusion, considerable TACA amounts were retained within the stratum corneum independently of dose and application frequency. A low TACA dose applied once should be preferred to a high dose, which may promote higher systemic exposure.

Project II: Effect of dose and application frequ ency Carolina Pellanda Page 72 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 7.1. Introduction In current dermato-pharmacotherapy, the application frequency of topical corticosteroids is a recurrently debated topic. Several studies have bee n performed to propose recommendations for optimal therapy. Once- or twice-daily applicati ons are common [193], and many dermatologists usually follow twice-daily applicati ons, although a superior efficacy of a multiple- daily application is not unequivocally proven. Rece ntly, a systematic review reported a similar efficacy of once-daily versus multiple-daily applic ations of atopic dermatitis [208]. In addition to pharmacodynamic investigations, only few pharmacokinetic studies investigating application f requency exist (reviewed in [256]). Unfortunately, these studies make their statements on data derived from drug concentration determination in plasma [222, 223] and urine [224, 225]. This information is incomplete because these data document systemic bioavailability and not topical bioavailability. Topical bioavailability can be estimated from the d rug concentration within the stratum corneum, which is expected to be related to the drug concent ration at the target site (i.e. viable epidermis or dermis) since the stratum corneum is the rate li miting barrier for percutaneous absorption. Similarly to the determination of the drug concentr ation in blood and/or urine as surrogate for the real concentration in the target tissue, the de termination of the drug concentration in the stratum corneum is a surrogate for the concentratio n in the viable (epi-)dermis [257]. A useful dermato-pharmacokinetic technique for the assessmen t of drug amounts in stratum corneum as a function of time is tape stripping, which enables removal of the stratum corneum layer by layer [93]. Human stratum corneum has the property to store pre viously applied drugs depending on the drug, the formulation, the application procedure, a nd the state of the skin [146]. Drug accumulation in the skin forms a reservoir, from wh ich minor amounts are released during a prolonged time period. The existence of a reservoir within the stratum corneum has been documented for several xenobiotics [146], particula rly for topical corticosteroids [148]. This is a welcome phenomenon for topical corticosteroids and affects the choice of application frequency and dose. Our investigation is focused on topical bioavailabi lity. We determined the in vivo penetration of triamcinolone acetonide (TACA), a moderately potent corticosteroid often used in dermatology, into human stratum corneum after different applicat ion modes. The investigation was divided into two parts. In experiment 1, the influence of t he dose was investigated by comparing the TACA penetration into stratum corneum after applica tion of a high (1x300 \u00b5g/cm 2) and a low (1x100 \u00b5g/cm 2) TACA dose. In experiment 2, the influence of appl ication frequency was investigated by comparing TACA penetration after a once-daily application of a high TACA dose (1x300 \u00b5g/cm 2) to TACA penetration after a applicat ion of a low TACA dose (3x100 \u00b5g/cm 2). 7.

Solutions of 4.2 mg/ml (for the application of 100 \u00b5g/cm 2) and 12.6 mg/ml (application of 300 \u00b5g/cm 2) TACA in acetone were prepared following current GMP guidelines. 7.2.2. Subjects and study design A total of 15 healthy adult volunteers with skin ph ototype II-III (Caucasian) and with minor hairiness of the volar aspect of the forearm were r ecruited and underwent a preliminary dermatological examination one week prior to study- start. The experiments were conducted on the volar aspect of the forearms during 2 days as a n open study with half-side intra-individual comparison. Experiment 1 (influence of dose) was re garded as explorative, whereas experiment 2 (influence of application frequency) w as the main investigation. TACA in acetone was applied on selected skin sites, from which the stratum corneum was harvested afterwards by tape stripping at 3 different time points accord ing to the protocol described below. No skin treatments were allowed during 24 h before study-st art, and volunteers were not allowed to shower or practise sports during the 2-day experime nt. Within 1 month after tape stripping, the wound healing was evaluated in a second dermatologi cal examination 8. Fig. 7-1 displays the flow chart of the study. The study was conducted ac cording to the ethical rules stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the loc al ethical committee and the national authorities (Swissmedic). The volunteers signed wri tten consent for participation. Fig. 7-1: Flow chart of the study: from recruitment to dismissal of the volunteers. The effect of dose (experiment 1) and application frequency (experimen t 2) was investigated. 8 The forms of the dermatological pre- and post-exam ination are displayed in the appendix 11.2 .1 Recruitment (n=15) Dermatological Pre-Examination - Assessment foreligibility -Written consent Entered EXPERIMENT 1 (n=5) - 3 women / 2 men - 23-37 years (mean 30) Entered EXPERIMENT 2 (n=10) -5 women / 5 men -20-44 years (mean 26) ARM 1 Application 1 x 300 \u00b5g/cm2 at 9 a.m. (on 3 different skin sites) Tape Stripping 0.5h / 4h / 24 h after application ARM 2 Application 1 x 100 \u00b5g/cm2 at 9 a.m. (on 3 different skin sites) Tape Stripping 0.5h / 4h / 24 h after application ARM 1 Application 1 x 300 \u00b5g/cm2 at 9 a.m. (on 3 different skin sites) Tape Stripping 4h / 8 h / 24 h afterapplication ARM 2 Application 3 x 100 \u00b5g/cm2 at 9 a.m. / 1 p.m. / 5 p.m. (on 3 different skin sites) Tape Stripping 4h / 8 h / 24 h after(first) application Dermatological Post-Examination (n=15) -Wound-healing application frequ ency Carolina Pellanda Page 74 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 7.2.3. Application of the formulations Three skin sites per arm were treated (total of 6 s kin sites per volunteer). The application area was delineated by a rectangular glass frame (10.5 c m 2) glued onto the skin (Sauer skin glue, Manfred Sauer GmbH, Lobbach, Germany). A volume of 250 \u00b5l formulation was uniformly applied with a Hamilton Syringe (Supelco, Buchs, Sw itzerland), and the vehicle was allowed to evaporate. In experiment 1, the high TACA dose (300 \u00b5g/cm 2) and the low TACA dose (100 \u00b5g/cm 2) were applied all at the same time (time 0 h, at 9 a.m.) on 3 different sites per arm. In experiment 2, the high TACA dose was applied at once on one arm (at 9 a.m.), whereas the low TACA dose was applied thrice on the other arm ( at 9 a.m., 1 p.m., 5 p.m.) Details of application and tape stripping procedure are given in Table 7-1. Skin sites not stripped within 0.5 h after application were covered with non-occlu sive cotton gauzes until tape stripping. No skin washing was performed to remove potential exce ss of formulation, because washing procedures have been correlated with an enhanced pe rcutaneous absorption [258].

When tape stripping f ollowed just after dosing (D T), a time span of 0.5 h was maintained b etween dosing and tape stripping to ensure an initi al penetration of TACA into the stratum corneum. (*) Note that in exp eriment 2 just 2 doses were applied at 4 h (skin si te 4); following the multiple application design, the total dose of 3 x 100 was not applied before 8 h. 7. Project II: Effect of dose and application frequ ency Carolina Pellanda Page 75 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 7.2.4. Skin sampling by tape stripping Stratum corneum tape stripping was performed after the following time intervals: in experiment 1 at 0.5 h, 4 h, and 24 h after applicat ion; in experiment 2 at 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h after (first) application (Table 7-1). To remove the stra tum corneum in a standardized manner from the exact same skin area, a template delineating a constant aperture of 3.3 x 1.7 cm (5.6 cm 2) was fixed on the skin. An adhesive tape (Tesa Multi -Film Crystal-Clear 57315, 19 mm width, Tesa, Beiersdorf, Hamburg, Germany) was placed on t his skin site, and a hand roller supplying a pressure of 140 g/cm 2 was passed over the tape 10 times. The tape was re moved with a rapid, firm movement and fixed across a photographi c slide frame. This procedure was repeated with new tapes until total removal of the stratum corneum, which was defined as light transmission through the tape 95%, measured by UV/VIS-spectroscopy (see next sec tion). Tape stripping of one skin site lasted about 15 min . No significant further drug diffusion into deeper skin layers is expected during the tape stri pping time, since the highest amount of drug is removed with the first tapes [259]. 7.2.5. Quantification of corneocytes The amount of corneocytes adhering to each tape was quantified by measuring the pseudo- absorbance of the corneocytes at 430 nm as describe d by Weigmann et al. [245]. The slide frames on which the tapes had been fixed were inser ted in the sample holder of a Lambda 35 spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, \u00dcberlingen, German y, custom-modified to obtain a rectangular light beam of 1 cm 2), and each tape was directly measured against a bl ank tape. 7.2.6. Quantification of TACA After quantification of the corneocytes, each tape was disassembled from the frame and extracted with 1.5 ml 60% methanol during 30 min on a horizontal shaker at 140 rpm (Heidolph Unimax 2010, Heidolph, Germany). To allow the calcu lation of a mass balance, the gauzes used to cover the treated skin sites were extracted similarly with 10 ml 60% methanol. TACA amounts in the extracts were quantified by an ICH-v alidated [237] HPLC method using a Symmetry Shield TM RP18 column (2.1 x 100 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m particle size) and a Waters Alliance HPLC System (2690 Separation Module, 996 Photodiode Array Detector), all Waters Corporation, Millford, Massachusetts, USA. The mobi le phase consisted of methanol 60% in water (v/v) with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Sample aliquots of 20 \u00b5l were injected, and quantification occurred at 240 nm. The limit of qua ntification (LOQ) was 100 ng/ml (corresponding to 27 ng/cm 2), the limit of detection (LOD) 35 ng/ml (9 ng/cm 2). 7. Project II: Effect of dose and application frequ ency Carolina Pellanda Page 76 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 7.2.7. Data analysis Sample size The method deviation (intra-individual standard dev iation) had been determined previously and was \u00b1 40%. To provide a power of 80% in detecting a 50% difference between the 2 treatments groups at the 5% significance level, a total of 10 volunteers are needed according to the two- sided t-test nomogram for paired values after logar ithmic transformation [260], and were thus enrolled in the main experiment 2. For the explorat ive experiment 1, a power of 50% was accepted, implicating the enrolment of 5 volunteers . Qualitative TACA penetration into stratum corneum ( penetration profiles) To graphically visualize the drug distribution with in the stratum corneum, TACA amounts quantified on each tape were correlated with tape n umber and depth of penetration into stratum corneum. Removal of the entire stratum corneum is a prerequisite for the profile calculation, since the sum of corneocytes (pseudo-)absorbance on one skin site represents 100% stratum corneum. Thus, the relative amount of stratum corne um removed by each tape can be calculated from the individual absorbance values as fully described in Jacobi et al. [126, 251]. Quantitative TACA penetration into stratum corneum The TACA amounts on each tape (area 5.6 cm 2) of each skin site were added up to the total TACA amount penetrated into stratum corneum, which was evaluated statistically. The significance of differences between the treatment g roups at each time was tested in a 2-sided paired-sample t-test after logarithmic transformati on. Two different types of evaluation were performed: the evaluation of a) the total TACA amou nt within stratum corneum (sum of TACA amounts on all tapes) and of b) the TACA amount wit hout tapes 1 to 3 (on which formulation excess, e.g. TACA crystals, could be located). Stat graphics PLUS 5 software (Manugistic, Inc., Rockville, Maryland, USA) was used to conduct the a nalysis of the trial. Mass balance To gain further information on the fate of TACA, a mass balance was performed. The following TACA amounts were calculated: a) TACA in the gauzes used to protect the application sites until tape stripping; b) TACA in tapes 1-3; c) TACA in the stratum corneum (without tapes 1-3); and d) TACA not recovered and presumably penetrated into deeper skin layers or diffused laterally. 7. Project II: Effect of dose and application frequ ency Carolina Pellanda Page 77 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 7.3. Results 7.3.1. Demographics of the subjects A total of 15 healthy adult volunteers (7 male and 8 female) aged 20-44 years (mean 27) were recruited and finished the study. Five volunteers w ere assigned to experiment 1 and ten volunteers to experiment 2 (Fig. 7-1). The tape str ipping experiments were conducted from March 2004 to July 2004 at the University Hospital Basel. The stripped skin sites displayed a good wound healing and no scarring at the final der matological investigation. Slight hyperpigmentation was observed in some volunteers. 7.3.2. Qualitative TACA penetration into stratum co rneum (penetration profiles) The depiction of the results as penetration profile s visualizes the localization of TACA within the stratum corneum. The typical penetration profile di splayed large TACA amounts in the upper stratum corneum and lower TACA amounts in the deepe r stratum corneum, indicating TACA permeation through the stratum corneum and penetrat ion into deeper tissues. In both experiments, similar penetration profiles of TACA o ver time were achieved, apart from a higher TACA amount usually located on the first stripped t ape after application of the higher dose (300 \u00b5g/cm 2) in experiment 1 or after multiple application (3x 100 \u00b5g/cm 2) in experiment 2. The penetration profiles obtained after the different a pplications of experiment 2 in one volunteer are displayed in Fig. 7-29. The mean number of tapes required to remove the ent ire stratum corneum in both experiments was 55, with a minimum of 29 tapes and a maximum of 80 (independently of gender and age). 9 The penetration profiles for each volunteer are di splayed in the appendix (chapter 11.2.1 for experim ent 1 and chapter 11.2.6 for experiment 2). 7.

At 0.5 h, almost the entire TACA dose applied was quantified within the stratum corneum: 245 \u00b1 78 \u00b5g/cm 2 after application of 300 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 101 \u00b1 17 \u00b5g/cm 2 after application of 100 \u00b5g/cm 2. At 4 h, lower TACA amounts of 80 \u00b1 19 \u00b5g/cm 2 (after application of 300 \u00b5g/cm 2) and 52 \u00b1 13 \u00b5g/cm 2 (after application of 100 \u00b5g/cm 2) were observed, and after 24 h still 46 \u00b1 18 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 33 \u00b119 \u00b5g/cm 2 were quantified. By excluding tapes 1-3, a dramatically lower amount was measured at 0.5 h within the stratum corneum, with TACA amounts of 74 \u00b1 12 \u00b5g/cm 2 (after application of 300 \u00b5g/cm 2) vs. 55 \u00b114 \u00b5g/cm 2 (after application of 100 \u00b5g/cm 2). No difference in the TACA amounts recovered after application of the two different doses was ob served at later time points: 31 \u00b1 15 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 30 \u00b1 16 \u00b5g/cm 2 at 4 h, and 27 \u00b1 13 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 23 \u00b1 14 \u00b5g/cm 2 at 24 h after application of 300 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 100 \u00b5g/cm 2, respectively. The extremely lower TACA amount obt ained by exclusion of tapes 1-3 showed that considerable amo unts are retained on the skin surface. Fig. 7-3: Total TACA amounts penetrated into the st ratum corneum in experiment 1 and experiment 2. Mea n and standard deviation calculated with all tapes (inclu ding tapes 1-3) are displayed. The double asterisk (**) denotes a highly significant difference (p < 0.01, 2-sided paired-sample t-test) between the pair differences at the specified time. Statistical evaluation of the corresponding pair di fferences yielded a highly significant difference of the TACA amounts quantified at 0.5 h when all ta pes were considered (p < 0.01) but no significance when tapes 1-3 were excluded (p > 0.05 ). At 4 h and 24 h, no statistically significant difference was observed for both evaluations (all t apes / without tapes 1-3). 10 The data table as well as the statistical evaluati on are displayed in the appendix (chapter 11.2.4 an d 11.2.5).

This slight difference became inexistent after di scarding the first 3 tapes (33 \u00b1 12 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 35 \u00b1 11 \u00b5g/cm 2, respectively). The pair difference was statistically not significant in both cases (p > 0. 05). Note that this time point displays a different totally applied dose (300 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 200 \u00b5g/cm 2). Taking this into account, the amount observed after multiple application was quite high: despite the application of a lower total dose, a similar TACA amount was quantified within the stratum corne um. At 8 h, TACA within the stratum corneum amounted to 44 \u00b1 29 \u00b5g/cm 2 (after application of 1x300 \u00b5g/cm 2) vs. 98 \u00b1 45 \u00b5g/cm 2 (after application of 3x100 \u00b5g/cm 2). This difference was highly significant (p < 0.01) when all tapes were c onsidered, but only a slight trend was seen after discarding tapes 1-3 (20 \u00b1 8 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 29 \u00b1 15 \u00b5g/cm 2 after application of 1x300 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 3x100 \u00b5g/cm 2, respectively, p = 0.06). At 24 h, similar total TACA amounts were quantified within the stratum corneum: 39 \u00b1 31 \u00b5g/cm 2 after application of 1x300 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 38 \u00b1 16 \u00b5g/cm 2 after 3x100 \u00b5g/cm 2 (24 \u00b1 14 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 23 \u00b1 9 \u00b5g/cm 2, respectively, after discarding tapes 1-3). These values showed no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). 7.3.4. Mass balance The application of a finite TACA dose permits the p erformance of a mass balance. For each treated skin site, 4 different values of recovered TACA amount were determined: 1) in the gauze; 2) in tapes 1-3; 3) in the stratum corneum w ithout tapes 1-3 and; 4) the remnant amount not recovered and presumably penetrated into deeper tissues or diffused laterally. The results of the mass balance are presented in Fig. 7-4 (expe riment 1) and Fig. 7-5 (experiment 2). The evaluation of both experiments showed that: a) TACA amounts of 10-23 \u00b5g/cm 2 did not penetrate into the stratum corneum and adhered to t he gauze (corresponding to 5-12% of the applied TACA dose). b) About half the amount recove red in the entire stratum corneum persisted within the upper stratum corneum and was found in tapes 1-3 (up to 57% of the applied TACA dose). c) TACA amounts recovered in th e stratum corneum without tapes 1-3 were not significantly different between the differ ent application modes. d) TACA seemed to permeate the stratum corneum more rapidly after a s ingle application of the high TACA dose (300 \u00b5g/cm 2), since the TACA amounts not recovered (and presum ably penetrated into deeper tissues) were already observed after 0.5 h (experim ent 1) and were high after 4 h (in both experiments 1 and 2). 11 The data table as well as the statistical evaluati on are displayed in the appendix (chapter 11.2.7 an d 11.2.8). 7.

Discussion A prerequisite for investigating topical products i s the stringent differentiation between topical and systemic bioavailability determination. In previous investi gations on percutaneous absorption of corticosteroids applied in acetone [2 24, 225], conclusions for topical therapy were drawn from data obtained by urinary excretion. Yet, data yielded from urinary excretion measure systemic bioavailability (of the topical application) and n ot topical bioavailability (of the topical application). Measurements of drug concentration in urine and/or blood are only a means for bioavailability evaluation when the pharmacological response is correlated to a systemic parameter or when the body burden is of interest. F urthermore, systemic drug concentrations after topical application do not represent drug con centrations at the target site in the skin but purely drug concentrations after permeation through the target site. Thus, the mere assessment of systemic bioavailability does not properly refle ct topical bioavailability for the treatment of local skin diseases [34, 261]. This trial has been performed to assess the topical bioavailability of TACA in a simple vehicle after different application modes. Acetone does not represent a vehicle normally used in dermatology, but has often been used as a vehicle f or investigational purposes [224, 225, 262]. TACA displays a very good solubility in acetone, an d the volatile vehicle allows the application of a finite, solvent-deposited drug amount [49, 59] . Therefore, an acetonic vehicle is appropriate for the purpose of this study. Especially after app lication of the high TACA dose, some drug crystallized on the skin surface because of the rap id vehicle evaporation. On the one hand, the crystals can get lost due to friction with clothes or due to normal desquamation (this amount was retained and quantified in the protective gauze during our experiments). On the other hand, drug crystals can also become bioavailable at later stages if redissolved, either physiologically by humid micro environmental conditions on the skin surface or by fresh vehicle in case of multiple applications [61]. This was one reason for not washing the skin during our experiments, assuming that the protective gauze would retain the superficial, unbound TACA. Moreover, washing procedures have been shown to enhance percu taneous penetration of topically applied compounds [258]. A frequently debated question arising from tape str ipping experiments is the inclusion or exclusion of the first tapes into the evaluation. T he answer depends on the study design. In our case, the drug was solvent-deposited on the skin, a nd the mass balance required the consideration of all the tapes. Thus, a separate ev aluation with and without tapes 1-3 was chosen. In our experiments, the topical bioavailability of TACA was described by the TACA penetration into stratum corneum over time. This is possible be cause the stratum corneum is the rate limiting barrier to percutaneous absorption, and th us the amount of drug in the stratum corneum may be considered to reflect to the amount of drug at the target site [257]. Experiment 1 displayed higher TACA amounts within the stratum co rneum after application of a high TACA 7. Project II: Effect of dose and application frequ ency Carolina Pellanda Page 83 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 dose (300 \u00b5g/cm 2) compared to a lower TACA dose (100 \u00b5g/cm 2). However, this difference was only significant immediately after application, whe n almost the entire TACA dose applied was recovered within the stratum corneum, whereas simil ar TACA amounts were found after discarding tapes 1-3. Usually, increasing the appli ed drug dose leads to a higher absolute (but a lower relative) percutaneous penetration, provided that the drug is dissolved [203]. In our experiment, after application of the higher TACA do se, the immediate evaporation of acetone led to the precipitation of a high TACA amount on t he skin surface and on the external layers of the stratum corneum. Experiment 2 showed slightly higher TACA amounts wi thin the stratum corneum after multiple application of a lower TACA dose (3x100 \u00b5g/cm 2) compared to the single application of the high TACA dose (1x300 \u00b5g/cm 2). As a result of multiple applications, the skin w as periodically reloaded with new drug, thus achieving temporary hi gher amounts within the stratum corneum. In order to characterize this temporary trend, the stripping times after application of the second (at 4 h) and third (at 8 h) dose in case of multipl e application were deliberately chosen. The highest drug amount was always localized within the upper stratum corneum layers and by excluding tapes 1-3 only insignificant differences between the TACA amounts recovered after the different application modes were observed (in b oth experiments). At 24 h, still well quantifiable TACA amounts were retained within the stratum corneum independently of dose and application frequency. Ye t, these TACA amounts were rather due to the slow diffusion through the stratum corneum barr ier than to a \"classical\" reservoir formation. This was underlined by the slow but existent diffus ion of TACA into deeper tissues. A similar topical bioavailability within the stratum corneum does no t necessarily imply a similar systemic bioavailability, not desired in topical therapy wit h corticosteroids. TACA amounts not quantified within the stratum corneum have presumab ly penetrated vertically into the viable epidermis and into the dermis, reaching the systemi c blood circulation. In addition, a horizontal, lateral diffusion into adjacent stratum corneum has also been observed in the past [123]. Both penetration routes may have played a role in our ex periments, but the vertical penetration usually represents the preferred route. The mass balance was performed to estimate the exte nt of the systemic exposure. After application of a total TACA dose of 300 \u00b5g/cm 2 (either as a single dose or divided into multiple doses), a high TACA amount was not recovered and se emed to have penetrated into deeper tissues. At 24 h, the extent of percutaneous absorp tion and thus the extent of systemic bioavailability seemed independent of the applicati on mode, but the release rate out of the stratum corneum into deeper tissues was lower after application of the multiple doses. On the contrary, after application of a total dose of 100 \u00b5g/cm 2, both extent and release of the drug out of the stratum corneum into deeper tissues was lowe r. Thus, a low TACA dose applied once may be preferable to a higher total TACA dose (appl ied once or thrice daily). This agrees with pharmacodynamic investigations [208], which showed that multiple-daily applications usually have no superiority. 7. Project II: Effect of dose and application frequ ency Carolina Pellanda Page 84 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 7.5. Conclusions In the present study, the effect of dose and applic ation frequency on the topical (cutaneous) bioavailability of TACA was determined by standardi zed tape stripping in human volunteers. Actual drug amounts were measured directly within t he stratum corneum, a layer preceding the target site. Independently of the dose and the application frequ ency, considerable TACA amounts were retained for 24 h within the stratum corneum (reser voir formation). A difference between the TACA amounts penetrated into the stratum corneum af ter the different application modes was observed immediately after application and was main ly due to a different TACA amount in the first 3 tapes. No major differences were observed a t later time points. Yet, a faster permeation through the stratum corneum and thus a higher syste mic exposure, not welcome in topical therapy, may be promoted by application of a high T ACA dose. Thus, a low TACA dose applied once may be preferable to a high TACA dose. 8. Project III: Effect of occlusion Carolina Pellanda Page 85 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 8. Project III: Effect of occlusion The findings of this project have been accepted for publication: Pellanda C, Strub C, Figueiredo Skin original pub lication is available at www.karger.com/spp. Abstract Occlusion by covering the skin with an impermeable wrap enhances skin hydration, affects drug absorption, and can induce the formation of a drug reservoir within the stratum corneum. This is desired in local therapy with topical corticosteroi ds. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of occlusion before (pre-occlusion, experime nt 1) and after (post-occlusion, experiment 2) application on the penetration of triamcinolone ace tonide (TACA) into the stratum corneum. The experiments were conducted on the forearms of 1 0 healthy volunteers. In experiment 1, a dose of 100 \u00b5g/cm 2 TACA was applied on 3 sites per arm, one arm having been pre-occluded for 16 h. In experiment 2, the same dose was applie d on 2 sites per arm, and one arm was occluded after application until skin sampling. Str atum corneum samples were removed by tape stripping at 0.5, 4, 24 h (experiment 1) and 4, 24 h (experiment 2) after application. Corneocytes and TACA were quantified by UV/VIS-spectroscopy and HPLC, respectively. The total TACA amount penetrated into stratum corneum was evaluate d by multifactor ANOVA. TACA penetration into stratum corneum with and with out pre-occlusion (experiment 1) showed no significant difference and decreased with time. Occlusion after application (experiment 2) produced a marked TACA accumulation within the stra tum corneum, which persisted for 24 h. In conclusion, pre-occlusion showed no effect on th e topical bioavailability of TACA in stratum corneum. Contrariwise, post-occlusion enhanced the penetration by a factor of 2, favoring the development of a drug reservoir. Keywords Occlusion Reservoir Tape stripping Topical bioavailability Triamcinolone acetonide 8. Project III: Effect of occlusion Carolina Pellanda Page 86 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 8.1. Introduction Occlusion by covering the skin with an impermeable wrap inhibits the physiological water loss through the skin and increases the skin temperature [67]. The enhanced skin hydration can induce morphological changes of the stratum corneum such as swelling of the corneocytes [69], water uptake into intercellular lipid domains [70], and deepening of skin furrows [68]. Such changes considerably affect the percutaneous a bsorption of topically applied drugs. Vickers observed in the early 60's that the applica tion of corticosteroids under occlusion promoted the formation of a long-lasting drug reser voir within the stratum corneum [148]. This is a welcome effect in local therapy with topical cort icosteroids. The longer the active drug is present within the skin, the longer a therapeutic e ffect can be expected. Occlusion does not enhance the percutaneous absorpt ion of all drugs [52, 233]. The enhancement appears to be compound and vehicle depe ndent [73]. Volatile solvents such as acetone and ethanol seem to induce a clear penetrat ion enhancement after application under occlusion [235]. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of occlusion on the in vivo penetration of triamcinolone acetonide (TACA), a moderately potent corticosteroid, into stratum corneum. In experiment 1, the effect of occlusion prior to topi cal application of TACA in acetone (pre- occlusion) was investigated. In experiment 2, the e ffect of occlusion after TACA application (post-occlusion) was investigated. 8.2. Subjects and methods 8.2.1. Material and formulation A solution of 4.2 mg/ml micronized (H\u00e4nseler AG, Herisau, Switzerland) was prepared following current GMP guidelines. 8. Project III: Effect of occlusion Carolina Pellanda Page 87 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 8.2.2. Subjects and study design A total of 10 healthy adult volunteers with skin ph ototype II-III (Caucasian) without excessive hairiness of the inner forearm were recruited and u nderwent a dermatological examination one week prior to study-start. The experiments were con ducted on the volar aspect of the forearms during 2 days as an open, explorative study with ha lf-side intra-individual comparison. In experiment 1, one arm was pre-occluded prior to TAC A application by wrapping it for 16 h in polypropylene film (Tangan \u00ae wrap). In experiment 2, occlusion of one arm follo wed TACA application, and the occlusive wrap was not removed until tape stripping. In both experiments, the contralateral arm served as control and was not occluded. Finite single doses (100 \u00b5g/cm 2) of TACA solution were applied on selected skin area s, which were afterwards sampled by tape stripping at different times following the protocol described below. Within 1 month after tape stripping, the wound healing was evaluated in a fin al dermatological examination 12 . Fig. 8-1 displays the flow chart of the study. The study was conducted according to the ethical ru les stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethical committee and the national authorities (Swissmedic). The volunteers signed written consent for participation . Fig. 8-1: Flow chart of the study: from recruitment to dismissal of the volunteers. The effect of pre- occlusion (experiment 1) and post-occlusion (experiment 2) on the TACA penetration into stratum corneum was investigated. 12 The forms of the dermatological pre- and post-exam ination are displayed in the women / 2 men -24-29 years (mean 25) Tape Stripping 0.5h / 4h / 24h afterapplication Pre-Occlusion women / 2 men -24-29 years (mean 25) Tape Stripping 0.5h / 4h / 24h afterapplication Pre-Occlusion of occlusion Carolina Pellanda Page 88 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 8.2.3. Application of the formulation In experiment 1, 3 skin sites per arm were treated (total of 6 skin sites per volunteer). In experiment 2, 2 skin sites per arm were treated (to tal of 4 skin sites per volunteer) 13 . The application area was delineated by a rectangular gl ass frame (10.5 cm 2) glued onto the skin (Sauer \u00ae skin glue, Manfred Sauer GmbH, Lobbach, Germany). A volume of 250 \u00b5l formulation, corresponding to a TACA dose of 100 \u00b5g/cm 2, was uniformly applied on the delineated area with a Hamilton Syringe (Supelco, Buchs, Switzerlan d). The vehicle was allowed to evaporate. Skin sites not stripped within 0.5 h after applicat ion were protected with non-occlusive cotton gauzes until tape stripping. No skin washing was pe rformed to remove excess of formulation, and the volunteers were not allowed to shower durin g the 2-day experiment. 8.2.4. Skin sampling by tape stripping Stratum corneum samples were removed by standardize d tape stripping [93] with Tesa tape (Tesa Multi-Film Crystal-Clear 57315, 19 mm width, Beiersdorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 0.5 h, 4 h, 24 h (experiment 1) and at 4 h, 24 h (experime nt 2) after application (Fig. 8-1). A template delineating an area of 5.6 cm 2 was fixed onto the skin. Tapes were successively pl aced onto this area and stripped off with a rapid movement until t he entire stratum corneum had been removed. A hand roller supplying a constant pressur e of 140 g/cm 2 was passed 10 times over each tape before removal. Total stratum corneum rem oval was defined as light transmission through the tape 95%, measured by UV/VIS-spectroscopy as described below. 8.2.5. Analytics The amount of corneocytes adhering to each tape was spectroscopically quantified directly on the tapes at 430 nm using a spectrophotometer (Lamb da 35, Perkin Elmer, \u00dcberlingen, Germany), custom-modified to obtain a rectangular l ight beam of 1 cm 2, as described in Weigmann et al. [245]. The quantification of the co rneocytes is required for the calculation of penetration profiles. The amounts of TACA adhering to each tape were quan tified by an ICH-validated [237] HPLC method after extraction with 1.5 ml 60% methanol on a horizontal shaker (30 min, 140 rpm, Heidolph Unimax 2010, Heidolph, Germany). The prote ctive gauzes were similarly extracted with 10 ml 60% methanol. A Symmetry Shield TM RP18 column and a Waters Alliance HPLC System (2690 Separation Module, 996 Photodiode Arra y Detector), all Waters Corporation, Millford, Massachusetts, USA, were used. Methanol 6 0% (v/v) with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min was the mobile phase, and the injection volume of the s amples was 20 \u00b5l. Quantification of TACA occurred at 240 nm. The limit of quantification (LO Q) was 100 ng/ml (corresponding to 27 ng/cm 2), the limit of detection (LOD) 35 ng/ml (9 ng/cm 2). 13 The detailed protocol of application, tape strippi ng, and occlusion is displayed in the appendix (cha 11.3.1). 8. Project III: Effect of occlusion Carolina Pellanda Page 89 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 8.2.6. Data analysis Sample size The method deviation (intra-individual standard dev iation) had been determined previously and was \u00b1 40%. To provide a power of 50% in detecting a 50% difference between the 2 treatments groups at the 5% significance level, a total of 5 v olunteers were needed according to the two- sided t-test nomogram for paired values after logar ithmic transformation [260], and were thus enrolled in each experiment. Quantitative TACA penetration into stratum corneum The TACA amounts on each tape (area 5.6 cm 2) of each skin site were added up to the total TACA amount penetrated into stratum corneum, which was evaluated statistically. The significance of differences between the treatment g roups at each time was tested after logarithmic transformation in a multifactor varianc e analysis (ANOVA) [30] with the following factors: volunteer, time, application and the inter action time/application. For the factors displaying a statistical significance in ANOVA (p < 0.05), a post-hoc comparison was performed with the least significance difference test (LSD te st). Two different types of evaluation were performed: the evaluation of a) the total TACA amou nt within stratum corneum (sum of TACA amounts on all tapes) and of b) the TACA amount wit hout tapes 1 to 3 (on which formulation excess, e.g. TACA crystals, could be located). Stat graphics PLUS 5 software (Manugistic, Inc., Rockville, Maryland, USA) was used to conduct the a nalysis of the trial. Qualitative TACA penetration into stratum corneum: penetration profiles and photographic recording To visualize the drug distribution within the strat um corneum, TACA amounts quantified on each tape were correlated to the tape number and to the depth of penetration into the stratum corneum. Removal of the entire stratum corneum is a prerequisite for the profile calculation, since the sum of corneocyte (pseudo-)absorbance on one skin site represents 100% stratum corneum. Thus, the relative amount of stratum corne um removed by each tape can be calculated from the individual absorbance values as fully described in Jacobi et al. [126, 251]. The stratum corneum removal pattern was photographi cally documented. All photographs were taken at a standard camera-object distance. 8. Project III: Effect of occlusion Carolina Pellanda Page 90 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 8.3. Results 8.3.1. Demographics of the subjects A total of 10 healthy adult volunteers (5 male and 5 female) aged 23-30 years (mean 25) were recruited and finished the study. Five volunteers w ere assigned to each experiment (Fig. 8-1). The tape stripping experiments were conducted from April 2004 to July 2004 in Basel. No skin damage was observed at the final dermatological inv estigation. 8.3.2. Quantitative TACA penetration into stratum c orneum Experiment 1: Effect of Pre-Occlusion Pre-occlusion showed no effect on the TACA penetrat ion into the stratum corneum (Fig. 8-2, left side) 14 . The penetrated TACA amount decreased significantl y with time after both application modes, with and without pre-occlusion (p < 0.001). At 0.5 h, mean TACA amounts of 66 \u00b1 28 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 67 \u00b1 37 \u00b5g/cm 2 were quantified within the stratum corneum of norm al and pre-occluded skin, respectively. At 4 h, mean value s of 48 \u00b1 17 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 43 \u00b1 10 \u00b5g/cm 2 were recovered on normal and pre-occluded skin, and at 24 h values of 29 \u00b1 12 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 18 \u00b1 10 \u00b5g/cm 2, respectively. By excluding tapes 1-3, the TACA amounts were appro ximately halved: at 0.5 h, mean values of 30 \u00b1 12 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 35 \u00b1 16 \u00b5g/cm 2 were obtained on normal and pre-occluded skin, respectively; at 4 h 25 \u00b1 8 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 24 \u00b1 8 \u00b5g/cm 2; and at 24 h 20 \u00b1 9 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 12 \u00b1 7 \u00b5g/cm 2. Independently of the application mode (with/without pre-occlusion), 8-13% of the applied TACA amount was recovered in the gauzes used to protect the treated skin sites 15 . Statistical evaluation by ANOVA displayed a signifi cant difference only for the factor time (p < 0.001), whereas the factors volunteer, applica tion, and the interaction time/application showed no influence. 14 The data table as well as the statistical evaluati on are displayed in the appendix (chapter 11.3.3 an d 11.3.4). 15 The mass balance of experiment 1 is displayed in t he appendix (chapter 11.3.8). 8. Project III: Effect of occlusion Carolina Pellanda Page 91 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Experiment 2: Effect of Post-Occlusion Post-occlusion induced a marked accumulation of TAC A within the stratum corneum. The amount of TACA recovered in the stratum corneum in case of post-occlusion showed a highly significant difference (p < 0.01) compared to non-o ccluded skin (Fig. 8-2, right side) 16 . Over time, the TACA amount within the stratum corne um remained constant after both application modes: after normal application (withou t occlusion), the values amounted to 40 \u00b1 28 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 42 \u00b1 14 \u00b5g/cm 2 at 4 h and 24 h, respectively. In case of post-occ lusion, a twofold higher TACA amount was quantified within th e stratum corneum, with values amounting to 80 \u00b1 32 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 79 \u00b1 33 \u00b5g/cm 2 at 4 h and 24 h, respectively. A similar trend was also seen after discarding tape s 1-3: after normal application, TACA amounts of 21 \u00b1 12 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 24 \u00b1 11 \u00b5g/cm 2 were quantified at 4 h and 24 h, vs. TACA amounts of 37 \u00b1 13 \u00b5g/cm 2 and 42 \u00b1 28 \u00b5g/cm 2 after application followed by post-occlusion. The TACA amount extracted from the gauzes displayed values of 11% of the applied dose after normal application and 3-7% after application under occlusion 17 .

Qualitative TACA penetration into stratum co rneum: penetration profiles and photographic recording Two exemplar penetration profiles of TACA into the stratum corneum at 24 h after normal and post-occluded application are depicted in Fig. 8-318 . The profiles show that TACA permeated the stratum corneum and reached deeper tissues. The higher TACA amount retained within the stratum corneum after application under post-occlus ion is clearly visible. The increased hydration of the skin due to occlusio n caused a decreased corneocyte cohesion. Fewer tapes were required to remove the entire stra tum corneum of occluded skin sites, since larger amounts of corneocytes were removed on singl e tapes. This happened in both experiments 1 and 2 after long-time occlusion and t ape stripping following within 0.5 h after removal of the occlusive wrap. The removal of large r amounts of corneocytes mostly occurred between tapes no. 5 and 10 (Fig. 8-4). Fig. 8-3: Typical penetration profiles of TACA into the stratum corneum 24 h after normal application and after application followed by occlusion in the same volun teer. TACA amounts on each tape (horizontal grey or black bars) are correlated to the tape number (right scal e) and to the depth of penetration into the stratum corneum, displayed as percentage of the total stratum corneu m thickness (left scale). 18 The penetration profiles for each volunteer are di splayed in the appendix (chapter 11.3.2 for experim ent 1 and chapter 11.3.5 for experiment 2). 8. Project III: Effect of occlusion Carolina Pellanda Page 93 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Fig. 8-4: Photographs of stripped tapes. Long-time occlusion induced a loosening of the stratum corneu m structure. Larger amounts of corneocytes (skin shee ts) were removed on single tapes. (A) 23 rd tape stripped from a non-occluded skin site: a \"normal\", homogeno us amount of skin is removed. (B) 4 th to 6 th tape stripped from a skin site occluded for 24 h: larger amounts of corneocytes are removed as sheets on single tape s. This artifact due to occlusion does not disturb the asse ssment of topical bioavailability provided that the entire stratum corneum of one skin site is sampled. 8.4. Discussion In the present experiments, the topical bioavailabi lity of TACA was described by the TACA penetration into stratum corneum over time. Because the stratum corneum is the rate limiting barrier of the skin, the TACA amount within the str atum corneum can be directly correlated to the amount of drug at the target site (viable epide rmis, dermis). Two different modes of occlusion (pre-occlusion) investigated the appli cation on occluded and thus more hydrated skin, as it is the case after an extensive bath. Pr e-occlusion did not show any effect on the TACA penetration into stratum corneum compared to n ormal application. Agner and Serup observed that the effect of occlusion on the stratu m corneum hydration is transitory, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) returning to basel ine values within 0.5-1 h after removal of the occlusive device [263]. Accordingly, in our exp eriment 1, larger amounts of corneocytes (skin sheets) due to the increased skin hydration a nd to the disruption of the stratum corneum were only observed at the first stripping time (0.5 h), when the occlusive wrap had just been removed. At later times (4 h and 24 h), the corneoc yte amount removed by the tapes was homogeneous. The disruptive effect of water on the stratum corne um structure was especially increased after about 5-10 tapes, whereas the outer and the innermo st stratum corneum seemed to be less affected. Accordingly, swelling of corneocytes and formation of water pools between the cells in the middle stratum corneum could be observed micros copically by Bouwstra et al. after 24 h hydration of stratum corneum isolated from dermatom ed skin #6 Project III: Effect of occlusion Carolina Pellanda Page 94 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Experiment 2 (post-occlusion) investigated the appl ication followed by occlusion, which can be clinically useful to improve the effect of topical corticosteroids in severe forms of skin diseases. A \"physiological\" occlusion is possible as well in intertriginous skin areas, and also certain vehicles (e.g., ointments) can be occlusive. Post-o cclusion enhanced the TACA retention into the stratum corneum by a factor of 2, favoring the development of a drug reservoir. The TACA amount retained by the stratum corneum remained con stant between 4 h and 24 h and still amounted to 80% of the applied dose after 24 h post -occlusion. The amount of drug quantified in the gauze used to protect the treated sites unti l tape stripping was slightly lower after occlusion, showing that occlusion probably promoted the dissolution of drug crystals located on the skin surface and drug penetration into the skin . The post-occlusion results obtained in our investig ations agree with preliminary observations of Carr and Wieland [152]. They investigated the percu taneous penetration of 14 C-labeled TACA applied in 95% ethanol on a single male volunteer. After one day, 81% of the applied dose was found within the stratum corneum after occlusion vs . 38% without occlusion. Our trial performed with a larger number of volunteers and a different volatile vehicle yielded similar results. The extent of the topical bioavailability of TACA was s ignificantly enhanced by post-occlusion, whereas the release rate from the stratum corneum w as delayed because of the temporary accumulation of TACA within the hydrated stratum co rneum (reservoir formation). The standardized tape stripping technique in combin ation with the quantification of corneocytes by VIS-spectroscopy and the quantification of TACA by HPLC has shown to be adequate for the quantification of TACA within the stratum corneum. This technique is not influenced by artifacts due to occlusion, and does not require radiolabelin g of the drug. 8.5. Conclusions Pre-occlusion showed no effect on the topical bioav ailability of TACA in stratum corneum. Contrariwise, occlusion after application enhanced the TACA penetration into stratum corneum by a factor of 2, favoring the development of a dru g reservoir. 9. Project IV: Efficacy of low-dose corticosteroids in atopic dermatitis Carolina Pellanda Page 95 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 9. Project IV: Efficacy of low-dose corticosteroids in atopic derm atitis An abbreviated version of the findings of this proj ect has been published: Pellanda C, Weber M, Bircher de in the phytocosmetic Lichtena atitis. Dermatology 2005; at www.karger .com/drm. Abstract Background: Previously, we reported the efficacy of Lichtena \u00ae - a phytocosmetic cream product - (AD). Later, fraudul ent triamcinolone acetonide (TACA) was detected at low doses (16 to 40 \u00b5g/g) in Lichtena \u00ae. This suggested that TACA may be effective at much lower concentrations than used in commercia l products (1000 \u00b5g/g). Objectives: To investigate the efficacy in AD of low-dose in Lichtena \u00ae compared to plain Lichtena \u00ae. Methods: Fourteen patients presenting symmetrical lesions of AD were treated for one month with Lichtena \u00ae plus 25 \u00b5g/g TACA (=verum) and plain Lichtena \u00ae (=placebo). The severity of the lesions was assessed by SCORAD on day 0 (=baseline) , 7, 14, and 28. Results: Already after 1 week treatment, significant SCORAD differences to baseline were observed comparing verum and placebo treated areas. No improvement was observed using plain Lichtena \u00ae. Conclusions: TACA displayed a significant improvement of AD at d oses up to 40 times lower than in commercial products. Keywords Atopic dermatitis Extemporaneous compounding atopic dermatitis Carolina Pellanda Page 96 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 9.1. Introduction Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory pruriti c skin disease that is often associated with elevated serum IgE levels and a personal or familia l history of type I allergies, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. The relapsing course of atopic dermatit is requires both preventive and therapeutical measures. In the last years, new ther apeutical approaches have been described, but topical corticosteroid therapy still remains th e standard to which other treatments are compared [264, 265]. Concern and almost phobic fear about the side effec t risk of corticosteroids, their chronic use, relapses after corticosteroid withdrawal, and lack of information leave more and more patients disappointed by steroid therapy [266, 267]. Alterna tive therapies such as phytotherapy [268, chinese herbal medicine [270], or complementary therapies [271] are often appreciated by patients because of their natural in gredients or the presumed absence of adverse effects. Yet, it has been repeatedly shown that some of these alternatives may also show potential adverse effects [272]. Cases are kno wn where remedies marketed as \"natural\" were adulterated with non-declared corticosteroids, thus creating a more critical situation because of the unawareness of corticosteroid presen ce [273-279]. Previously, we have studied the apparent benefit of Lichtena \u00ae, a phytocosmetic cream marketed as a skin care product in some European countries a nd extensively used for its putative anti- inflammatory activity for different types of skin d isorders including atopic dermatitis in children [280]. In a placebo controlled double-blind study i ncluding 21 patients (age 2 to 56 years) with symmetrical atopic eczema on the extremities, a mar ked reduction on the verum side was observed [281]. Later, triamcinolone acetonide (TAC A), a moderately potent corticosteroid, was identified in Lichtena \u00ae at low concentrations ranging from 16 to 40 \u00b5g/g ( mean 27) [282], whereas commercial TACA preparations typically cont ain 1000 \u00b5g/g. Meanwhile, measures have been established to control the correct compos ition of Lichtena \u00ae, which has been cleared of any corticosteroids (Table 9-1). The reported efficacy of the adulterated Lichtena \u00ae cream leads to the presumption that commercially available corticosteroid formulations may be overdosed and would be effective at lower concentrations. We therefore performed a seco nd study, described in this paper, with the aim to investigate the effect of a low-dose TACA ad dition in atopic dermatitis Carolina Pellanda Page 97 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 Table 9-1: Ingredients of Lichtena \u00ae, their function, and PA: irritative ag ent.

Subjects and methods 9.2.1. Subjects Patients were recruited at the Allergological and D ermatological outpatient clinic of the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland. A total of 14 patients (9 females and 5 males) aged 3 to 41 years (median 20), who presented symmetrical lesions of subacute or chronic atopic dermatitis of the extremities were enrolled in the study. Atopic skin diathesis was diagnosed according to Hanifin and Rajka [283] 19 and ranged from 7 to 23 (median 16). Exclusion cri teria were allergy to Lichtena \u00ae or TACA, treatment with systemic corticosteroids, long-term treatment with topical steroids, immunosuppression, severe se condary diseases, pregnancy, or breast feeding. 9.2.2. Study design A double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized expl orative study with half-side comparison was performed. The study was approved by the local ethi cal committee and the patients signed a written consent for participation. The patients und erwent a one-week run-in phase without specific therapy, and were then treated twice a day for one month at the corresponding symmetrical locations with a) Lichtena to which 25 \u00b5g/g of TACA had been added (= verum), and b) Lichtena \u00ae without any supplement (= placebo). The creams wer e randomly allocated to the left or right side in a double-blinded manner. The randomization was performed at the Hospital Pharmacy, Basel, Switzerland using a rando m number generator, and the number sequence was concealed until the end of the study. The Lichtena cream (placebo) was purchased from UCB Pharma, Italy. The Lichtena cream with added TACA (verum) was prepared at the Hospital Pharmacy, Basel, Switzerla nd according to GMP-Guidelines. Both preparations were filled in identical tubes and bli nded. The patients were examined on day 0, 7, 14 and 28 ( \u00b1 2 days) after beginning of the therapy. The severity of the lesions was assessed on each sy mmetrical body side separately by SCORAD [284] at each medical examination 20 and photographs of the lesions were taken. SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) is a score that combines A) the extent of the lesions; B) the intensity of six clinical signs: erythema, edem a/papules, oozing/crusts, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness, ranging from 0 to 3 ( 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe); and C) the subjective symptoms pruritu s and sleep loss ranging from 0 to 10 on a visual analogue scale. The total score is defined a s: SCORAD = (A/5) + (7 B/2) + C. 19 The criteria for atopic skin diathesis assessment are displayed in the appendix (chapter 11.4.1). 20 The form for SCORAD assessment is displayed in the appendix (chapter 11.4.2). 9. Project IV: Efficacy of low-dose corticosteroids in atopic dermatitis Carolina Pellanda Page 99 of 186 University of Bas el, 2006 In addition, the patients had to record in a diary the daily use of cream (assessed as finger tip units FTU [285]), the efficacy of the creams (asses sed as itching, erythema/papules, exudation), adverse effects (prickling/pricking, erythema after application, others), overall troubles (insomnia, well-being, subjective improvement of th e skin), and the use of rescue medication. Rescue medication against itching consisted of ceti rizine 10 mg (Zyrtec drops or tablets). In case of aggravation of the skin lesions, a 0.25% pr ednicarbate cream (Prednitop Cream) could be applied after medical consultation. To assess th e allergenic potential of the cream, a patch test with the European series of contact allergens and a specific array of all Lichtena ingredients was performed 2-4 weeks after the end o f the study 21 . 9.2.3. Comparison of the efficacy of the two differ ent treatments (verum/placebo) The assessment of the efficacy of the different tre atments (verum, placebo) over time was defined as primary outcome of the study. SCORAD dif ferences at day 7, 14, and 28 to the baseline (= day 0) were calculated for verum and pl acebo separately and evaluated statistically using the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank sum te st at the 5% level of significance (2-sided analysis). In addition, a modified objective SCORAD was calculated omitting the subjective symptoms C: SCORAD objective = (A/5) + (7 B/2), which was evaluated likewise wit h the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank sum test. Statgraphics PLUS 5 software (Manugistic, Inc., Rockville, Maryland, USA) was used to conduct the a nalysis of the trial. 9.2.4. Efficacy within one treatment arm after one month therapy (verum/placebo separately) As a secondary outcome, to assess the efficacy of t he one-month treatment compared to the baseline for verum and placebo separately, the SCOR AD of day 28 was compared to the SCORAD of day 0 in a Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank sum test (5% level of significance). The same analysis was carried out with SCORAD objective . 9.2.5. Intensity criteria and pruritus The intensity of the six clinical signs erythema, e dema/papules, oozing/crusts, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness as well as the subject ive symptom pruritus were plotted in individual score-time curves. Significant influence of the one -month therapy on the different criteria was tested for verum and placebo separately in a Wilcox on matched pairs signed rank sum test (5% level of significance) using the score pairs of day 28 / day 0. 21 The patch-test ingredients are listed in the appen dix (chapter 11.4.3). 9.

Demographics of the subjects Of the 14 patients enrolled, 12 finished the study. Two drop outs (one male aged 3 years, one female aged 18) were recorded because of irregular attending the medical examinations and their data were excluded in the analysis. The medic al examinations began in February and ended in July. In addition to atopic dermatitis, 4 patients were s uffering from asthma and 8 relatives were likewise atopic, suffering from atopic dermatitis, eczema, asthma, or allergic rhinitis. Clinical severity of atopic dermatitis, expressed by SCORAD, ranged from 5 to 69 on the verum side and from 12 to 77 on the placebo side during the wh ole study. The data are summarized in Table 9-2 22 . Table 9-2: Summary of total SCORAD recorded during the investigation period, SCORAD differences of eac h treatment day to the baseline, SCORAD objective , and SCORAD objective -differences.

Comparison of the efficacy of the two differ ent treatments (verum/placebo) SCORAD at day 0 (baseline) was comparable and rangi ng from 25 to 69 for the two treatment arms (verum, placebo). After beginning the therapy, the SCORAD values of the verum-treated side constantly decreased (median SCORAD at day 0 / 7 / 14 / 28 displaying values of 40 / 30 / 26 / 22 respectively). Contrariwise, the SCORAD val ues on the placebo-treated side persisted near the baseline and were slightly increased at th e end of the therapy (median SCORAD ranging from 39 to 42 during the whole month). Stat istical analyses of SCORAD differences to baseline resulted in a significant difference betwe en the side treated with Lichtena \u00ae plus TACA (verum) compared to plain Lichtena \u00ae (placebo) already after 1 week treatment (median difference of 9, p = 0.04). This significant differ ence persisted at day 14 (median 11, p = 0.02) and became highly significant at the end of the the rapy (median 16 at day 28, p = 0.01) (Fig. 9-1, left diagram). By omitting the criterion \"subjective symptoms\" in the calculation of SCORAD (= SCORAD objective ), it is possible to evaluate the mere objective cr iteria. The evaluation of SCORAD objective yielded similar results: the difference between pl acebo and verum treatment became statistically different at day 7 (p = 0.04), stayed significant at day 14 (p = 0.02), and became highly significant at day 28 (p < 0.01).

Intensity criteria and pruritus The time response of the individual intensity facto rs erythema, edema/papules, oozing/crusts, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness as well a s the subjective symptom pruritus are depicted in Fig. 9-3 and Fig. 9-4. The intensity factors sco res range from 0 to 3 (0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe), and the pruritus score r anges from 0 to 10 (0 = absent; 10 = severe). The analysis of the intensity factors separately sh owed as well a superiority of the verum treatment. On the verum-treated side, the one-month therapy resulted in a significant decrease of the score for the following criteria: erythema ( p = 0.02), lichenification (p = 0.02), and dryness (p < 0.01), when day 28 was compared to day 0. The severity of the criterion edema/papules did not show any statistically significant decrease (p > 0.1), and the decrease in the severity of excoriation just showed a non-significant trend (p = 0.06). The criterion oozing/crusts was not present in our patients. No improvement was recorde d on the placebo-treated side (p > 0.9). The criteria erythema and edema/papules even showed a temporary impairment during the therapy. Similarly, a highly significant decrease of the pru ritus intensity was recorded on the verum- treated side (p = 0.008), whereas no difference was reported on the placebo side (p > 0.1). The score showed an initial median value of 6 at day 0 and a lower median value of 1 (verum) and 4.5 (placebo) at day 28.

Rescue medication The use of additional topical corticosteroids (pred nicarbate) in case of aggravation of the skin lesions was low: three patients applied prednicarba te 2-3 times and one patient 7 times during the whole month on both extremities. The use of cet irizine in case of itching was higher: two patients took 1 tablet once a day during the whole month, seven patients took it occasionally (a total of 3-15 tablets over the whole month), and th ree patients did not use cetirizine at all. 9.3.6. Adverse effects and subjective evaluation Both formulations were well tolerated and no advers e effects were recorded. The qualities of quick skin penetration, good consistency, and smoot hness of the creams were reported by the patients. Slight burning after application was reco rded by 3 patients (for both placebo and verum). The duration of hydration and lipidization of the lesions was reported to be 1-8 h (mean 6 h). The amount of cream used was expressed as fin ger tip unit (FTU). The same amount of cream was applied on each side (1-2 FTU, depending on the extension of the lesions). 9.3.7.

Discussion Plain Lichtena \u00ae had no significant influence on the severity of at opic dermatitis measured by SCORAD. Contrariwise, the addition of TACA in a con centration which is 40 times lower than typical therapeutical corticosteroid concentrations (25 \u00b5g/g vs. 1000 \u00b5g/g) reduced the severity of the lesions. Particularly, the signs indicating subacute or chro nic inflammation displayed a marked improvement. These included erythema, lichenificati on, and dryness (Fig. 9-3a, e, f). Criteria representing acute lesions such as oozing and crust s were not present in our patients (Fig. 9-3c). While the decrease of the factors edem a/papules and excoriation was not significant, complete remission indicated by a zero score at day 28 was recorded for their median score (Fig. 9-3b, d) as well as for the fact or erythema (verum-treated side). For the factor edema/papules this may indicate that the ini tial score was already quite low (median score at day 0 = 1 = mild disorders), the following reduction being not large enough to result in a statistically significant decrease. Subjective symp toms like pruritus were as well successfully improved with the verum treatment (Fig. 9-4), thus contributing to an increased well-being of the patients. The use of rescue medication as a marker of unsucce ssful therapy was quite low, especially the use of the additional topical corticosteroid predni carbate. The consequent intake of cetirizine once a day by two patients indicates that its relat ive high use may be due to additional troubles like allergic rhinitis, and not to pruritus alone. The additional use of emollients and skin care prod ucts is considered to be standard therapy for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, but only few st udies have tried to assess the effects of emollients alone on the severity of atopic dermatit is [286-288]. Interestingly, even the score \"dryness\" does not show a significant reduction aft er treatment with plain Lichtena \u00ae. During an acute episode, the simple use of an emollient does not seem to be sufficient to treat the lesions. A more aggressive therapy is required, emollients p laying a decisive role later on in the skin care, particularly to prevent relapses. The presence of several allergens in Lichtena \u00ae represents an additional exposure of the already affected skin to unnecessary irritations. In the pa tch test, two patients showed a positive reaction to Fudge perfume, EDTA, and Apifil, all in gredients of Lichtena \u00ae. Our trial confirms that Lichtena \u00ae alone has no anti-inflammatory activity after topi cal application on atopic dermatitis lesions. However, the addition of TACA in a concentration which is 40 times lower than typical therapeutic corticosteroid conce ntrations reduces inflammation in mild to moderate eczema. These findings would justify the u se of much lower corticosteroid concentrations than typically marketed and used tod ay, particularly in subacute and chronic eczema and in children. This is sometimes overcome by dispensing brand corticosteroids which are \"diluted\" by the addition of vehicle or other a gents. This extemporaneous dilution of topical corticosteroid formulations is intended to reduce t he risk of adverse effects while maintaining 9. Project IV: Efficacy of low-dose corticosteroids in atopic dermatitis Carolina Pellanda Page 106 of 186 University of Ba sel, 2006 efficacy. However, improper dilution may compromise several factors such as stability (chemical and microbiological), rheology, and bioavailability , thus diminishing or even completely deactivating the therapeutical activity of the form ulation (compare Table 9-3) [289-292]. Table 9-3: Consequences and risks due to improper d ilution of drug formulations. Factors that are affected by dilution of drug formu lations Bioavailability Concentration, state of solution/di spersion of the drug in the vehicle, diffusion coefficient, and partition coefficient all influenc e the optimum release of a drug out of the formulation. Change in any of these factors may lead to an ineffective formulation. Chemical stability Change of pH, as well as dilutio n of antioxidants and preservatives may lead to chemical instability and enhance chemical degradati on. Toxicology and safety Drug degradation can lead to toxic degradation products. Interactions Drug-drug interactions but also drug-a djuvant interactions lead to chemical instability and can affect the efficacy of the form ulation (both increase and decrease of the effect possible). Microbiological quality Dilution of preservatives b elow the effective concentration can lead to microbiological contamination, which leads to chemi cal degradation and iatrogenic contamination of the treated skin sides. Rheology Change of the composition of a formulation changes the rheology of the product and its cosmetic elegance. Economic aspects Extemporaneous compounding is gene rally expensive and leads to a higher price of the therapy. Yet, the popularity of diluted corticosteroid formu lations reveals the desire and the need for properly manufactured corticosteroid formulations t o be available in much lower concentrations for some clinical situations, particularly for chro nic skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis. Our trial shows that topical preparations of corticoste roids are possibly overdosed to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Therefore, dose-finding studies should be an integral and important part of the clinical evaluation of topical therapeu tics. 9.5. Conclusions This study showed no anti-inflammatory properties o f Lichtena \u00ae, a phytocosmetic cream marketed as a skin care product and extensively use d for its putative anti-inflammatory activity for different types of skin disorders including ato pic dermatitis in children. However, the addition of a low dose (40 times lower than in typical thera peutical concentrations) of the corticosteroid TACA to Lichtena \u00ae induced an improvement of the eczematous lesions. These findings indicate that some corticosteroids m ay already be effective at much lower concentrations than usually used therapeutically, a nd that marketed formulations may contain a much higher concentration of corticosteroids than n ecessary. 10. Final conclusions and perspectives Carolina Pellanda Page 107 of 186 University of Ba sel, 2006 10. Final conclusions and perspectives The present thesis shows that the investigation of the topical bioavailability of TACA as model corticosteroid can successfully be performed using the DPK approach. The basic principle is the quantification of drug amounts penetrated into the stratum corneum over time. The analysis of the stratum corneum usually requires its removal, a nd tape stripping is a useful technique for this. The layer by layer removal and analysis of th e stratum corneum enables the visualization of the penetration pattern of the topically applied drug. Even though the target site may not always be the stratum corneum, the drug must pass t hrough the stratum corneum barrier to reach deeper sites of action. Moreover, the removal of this layer does not induce permanent skin damage. The combination of following techniques was applied in this thesis for the investigation of topical bioavailability: 1) tape stripping for stratum corn eum sampling, 2) UV/VIS-spectroscopy for quantification of corneocytes, and 3) HPLC for quan tification of TACA as model corticosteroid. Since tape stripping is susceptible to numerous con founding factors, the technique requires an accurately standardized protocol, which was develop ed in Project I. The tape stripping protocol included a) the use of a template to ensure the rem oval of stratum corneum samples from the same skin site, b) the use of a hand roller to ensu re a constant pressure on the tape before stripping, c) the removal of each tape with a rapid firm movement, d) the alternation of the tape removal (elbow-to-wrist, wrist-to-elbow) to ensure a homogenous removal and to minimize skin irritation, e) the removal of the entire stratum co rneum of one skin site to cope with the inter- and intra-individual differences of stratum corneum thickness. The UV/VIS-spectroscopical method for quantification of the corneocytes had be en validated by Weigmann et al. [245] and was adopted. The HPLC method for TACA quantificatio n had to be developed and validated. The analytical challenge consisted in the developme nt of a sensitive analytical method, capable to quantify low amounts of TACA distributed on sing le tapes. Therefore, a low limit of quantification (LOQ) was aimed at. The HPLC method was successfully validated and proved to have suitable specificity, linearity, accuracy, pre cision, and robustness in the working range. The LOQ of 0.1 \u00b5g/ml enables the quantification of 27 ng/cm 2 TACA on single tapes. The proof of concept proved that the set of method is suitabl e to distinguish between the different penetration pattern of TACA applied in different fo rmulations (acetonic solution, ethanolic gel). Whereas the TACA penetration from the acetonic solu tion was high and TACA reached deeper layers of the stratum corneum, the TACA penetration from the ethanolic gel was only superficial, most TACA being retained within the cellulose-matri x of the gel after evaporation of the solvent. After the proof of concept, the method set was read y to be applied for the investigation of different factors determining the pharmacotherapy w ith topical corticosteroids. Despite being a relative old drug class, topical co rticosteroids are still the gold standard for the treatment of several dermatological affections, e.g . atopic dermatitis. A sufficient dose of steroid has to be provided in a suitable vehicle with an op timum application frequency to ensure an 10. Final conclusions and perspectives Carolina Pellanda Page 108 of 186 University of Ba sel, 2006 adequate penetration into the affected skin areas a nd to finally ensure efficacy. Moreover, the accumulation of topically applied drug as a skin re servoir can considerably affect the therapy pattern in term of dose and application frequency. Particularly in case of corticosteroids, the formation of a stratum corneum reservoir and a slow drug release to deeper skin tissues over a longer time period is advantageous and desired to p revent systemic side effects. To ensure an optimized pharmacotherapy, both pharma cokinetic and pharmacodynamic investigations are required and were performed in t his thesis. Project II describes a pharmacokinetic clinical trial investigating the in fluence of dose and application frequency on the percutaneous penetration of TACA applied in an acetonic vehicle to 15 healthy human volunteers. In the dose experiment, higher TACA amo unts were quantified within the stratum corneum after application of the high dose (300 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 100 \u00b5g/cm 2), as intuitively expected. However, this difference was only significant immed iately after application. A high TACA amount crystallized on the skin surface after evapo ration of the vehicle. The TACA crystals were mainly quantified on tapes 1-3, and are not su pposed to be bioavailable unless additional solvent is applied or unless the hydration status o f the skin is raised, e.g. by occlusion. The application frequency experiment showed slightly hi gher TACA amounts within the stratum corneum after multiple application (3x100 \u00b5g/cm 2) compared to the application of the total TACA dose at once (1x300 \u00b5g/cm 2). As a result of multiple applications, the skin w as periodically reloaded with new drug, thus achieving temporary hi gher amounts within the stratum corneum, and re-solving eventual TACA crystals on the skin s urface. The highest drug amount was always localized in the upper stratum corneum layer s, and by excluding tapes 1-3, only minor differences between the TACA amounts after the diff erent application modes were observed in both experiments. The performance of a mass balance showed that a high TACA dose may promote a faster permeation through the stratum cor neum and thus a possibly higher systemic exposure, unwelcome in topical therapy. Thus, a low dose applied once daily may be preferable to a higher dose. These findings are in agreement w ith pharmacodynamic investigations, which have shown that usually multiple-daily applications have no superiority to a once-daily regimen. The efficacy of low-dose TACA in the treatment of a topic dermatitis was proved by Project IV . In a pharmacodynamic clinical trial with 14 patient s suffering from atopic dermatitis, the addition of low-dose TACA to a marketed skin care cream form ulation (Lichtena \u00ae), applied twice-daily, induced a significant improvement of the eczematous lesions, whereas the application of the cream base alone did not. These findings indicate t hat some corticosteroids may already be effective at much lower concentrations than usually used therapeutically, and that marketed corticosteroid formulations may contain a much high er concentration than necessary. A further factor enhancing the percutaneous penetra tion of topically applied compounds is occlusion, which increases skin hydration and tempe rature. We can distinguish between: 1) application on occluded skin (pre-occlusion), as it can be the case if a topical formulation is applied on thoroughly hydrated skin (e.g. after a b ath), and 2) occlusion after application (post- occlusion), as is sometimes performed in clinical p ractice to improve the effect of topical 10. Final conclusions and perspectives Carolina Pellanda Page 109 of 186 University of Ba sel, 2006 corticosteroids in severe forms of skin diseases. T he effects of pre- and post-occlusion were investigated in a pharmacokinetic clinical trial wi th 10 healthy volunteers, described in Project III . Pre-occlusion did not show any effect on the perc utaneous penetration of TACA into stratum corneum over time. On the contrary, post-oc clusion showed a clear enhancement of the TACA penetration and an accumulation of a double TA CA amount within the stratum corneum. The choice of TACA as relative lipophilic compound (logP 2.3) and acetone as volatile vehicle was advantageous for the investigation of the effec t of occlusion, since the occlusion-induced penetration enhancement and reservoir formation app ear to be compound and vehicle dependent. A higher effect is observed with lipophi lic compounds and volatile vehicles. During the pharmacokinetic investigations performed in this thesis, different types of reservoir could be discerned. Post-occlusion (Project III) in duced a long-term TACA accumulation in the stratum corneum (\"classical\" reservoir). The TACA d iffusion into deeper tissues was inhibited at least for 24 h. After application without occlusion (Project II), independently of dose and application frequency, considerable TACA amounts we re still measured within the stratum corneum. Yet, these high TACA amounts were rather d ue to the slow diffusion through the stratum corneum barrier than to a \"classical\" reser voir formation. This was underlined by the slow but existent diffusion of TACA into deeper tis sues. In Project I, not a stratum corneum reservoir, but a skin surface reservoir was induced after application of the gel formulation. The DPK methodology described in this thesis can be applied for the bioavailability investigation of other compounds as well, provided that a specifi c analytical method for their quantification is developed and validated. Determinant for successful investigations using tape stripping is the awareness that a fixed number of tapes does never r emove the same amount of stratum corneum. Endogenous (inter- and intra-individual va riations) and exogenous factors (e.g., vehicle effects, occlusion) can change the stratum corneum amount removed by a single tape, as was demonstrated in Project III. The overhydrati on of the skin after occlusion induced a reduced cohesion of the corneocytes, and only half the number of tapes was required to remove the entire stratum corneum compared to non-occluded sites. The removal of a fixed tape number (e.g., 20 tapes) would have led to incorrect results. The most correct approach is without doubt the removal of the entire stratum cor neum, as was performed in this thesis. Yet, the removal of up to 80 tapes for one test site is correlated to the time-consuming analytical analysis of each tape. In a recent investigation, J acobi et al. developed a promising mathematical model for the prediction of the stratu m corneum amount removed without the need of its complete removal. They observed that th e pseudo-absorption, measured to quantify the corneocytes, correlates linearly to the cell la yers removed, and that a pseudo-absorption of 0.25 reflects one single corneocyte layer [244]. The draft guidance \"Topical dermatological drug pro ducts NDAs and ANDAs - In vivo bioavailability, bioequivalence, in vitro release, and associated studies\" released in 1998 by the FDA already proposed tape stripping as DPK approach for the assessment of bioavailability and bioequivalence of topically applied compounds. The withdrawal of the draft guidance in 2002 10. Final conclusions and perspectives Carolina Pellanda Page 110 of 186 University of Ba sel, 2006 showed that not the technique itself, but the propo sed protocol (e.g., removal of a fixed number of 12 tapes, discarding of the first 2 tapes) was n ot yet mature for bioavailability and bioequivalence testing. The investigations describe d in this thesis show how tape stripping, correctly performed, asserts itself as a valuable t echnique for bioavailability assessment. Additional bioequivalence investigations with the p roposed set of methods could lead to the reconsideration of tape stripping also on a regulat ory level. 11.

T his film was removed with the first stripped tape and interfered with the spectroscopical quanti fication of the corneocytes. Therefore, a normalization of the corneocyte amount adhering on the first tape was necessary, and the profiles are depicted with normalized tape 1 (left side). Because the TACA amount on tape 1 was very large, the TACA concentration scale differ s by a factor of 10 compared to the scale of the penetration profiles after application of the a cetonic solution (50 \u00b5g/cm 2 vs. 5 \u00b5g/cm 2). Thus, to facilitate the comparison between the 2 formulat ions, the penetration profiles after application of the ethanolic gel are additionally depicted with out tape 1 (right side, scale 5 \u00b5g/cm 2). 11.
