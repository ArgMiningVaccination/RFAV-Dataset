It replaces the Hospice Visits When Death is Imminent measure. Learn more about the [measure development process](/medicare/hospice-quality-reporting-program/quality-measure-development). Compliance What's the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing Program? CMS created the [Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program](/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Improper-Payment-Measurement-Programs/CERT) to measure the rate of improper Fee-for-Service payments. The error rate measures payments that didn't meet Medicare requirements; it doesn't indicate fraud. How does the CERT program work? The CERT contractor reviews a sample of processed claims. If a claim doesn't meet Medicare's coverage, coding, and billing rules, or the provider fails to submit medical records, it's counted as a total or partial improper payment. [Medicare Administrative Contractors](/Medicare/Medicare-Contracting/Medicare-Administrative-Contractors/What-is-a-MAC) analyze CERT error rates to reduce improper payments by updating their internal processes and educating providers.
