The standard detox program is 5-weeks long, which consists of 1-week preparation stage, 2-weeks fasting with detox herbal juice stage, and 2-weeks recovery stage. Our detox program is sought by individuals with a variety of needs including weight loss, allergies, infertility , PCOS, skin issues, and metabolic syndromes. At Acupia, we specifically tailor the program with personal nutrition and exercise consultations designed to help each client best meet their goals. For each client, our trained professionals provide extensive care. With our Reset Detox program, a client schedules an appointment with our acupuncturists twice a week. At each appointment, we help track a client's progress with our In-Body Technology, a cutting-edge tool that accurately analyzes body composition with tactile electrode systems. Our In-Body Technology allows us to measure the composition of water, fat, and muscles, and thereby accurately determine how body composition is transforming during the program. For instance, we can directly measure if our clients' weight loss is due to burning fat or losing water and muscles. In addition, we provide fire cupping, lymphatic drainage technique, VST acupuncture, heat therapy throughout the ten appointments to maximize fat burn and removal of toxins. Many weight loss programs focus on the sheer number of pounds lost measured by a weight scale and do not have the professional technology to accurately measure the changes in body composition. Often times, with limited measuring technology and water weight loss, individuals experience the \"yo-yo effect,\" which is when one quickly gains regains weight. But Acupia's Reset Detox targets to transform our client's metabolism and lifestyle during the program to better maintain the results gained at the end. We also offer an additional extension maintenance program with weekly appointments. "}
