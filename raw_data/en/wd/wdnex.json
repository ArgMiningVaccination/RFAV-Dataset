Definitions Cognitive impairment: A cognitive impairment in the LTCFS is defined as a permanent impairment of thought due to a severe and persistent mental illness, dementia, brain injury, intellectual/developmental disability, or other organic brain disorder. - A cognitive impairment does not include temporary impairment due to medications and/or substance use intoxication. - A cognitive impairment does not include temporary impairment due to a temporary medical condition such as infection, electrolyte imbalance, or dehydration. Declining the task: A person declines a task when that person decides not to complete one or more health-related services or tasks included on the HRS Table or in the IADL Medication Management and Medication Administration. Refer to the General Guidance section in this module for specific details to consider when a task has been declined. Need for assistance: A need for assistance in the LTCFS is the NEED for \"help from another person,\" which is defined as supervision, cueing, and/or hands-on assistance (partial or complete). Refer to the General Guidance section in this module for specific details about need for assistance. Memory loss: An unverified diagnosis of Memory Loss can only be selected on the Diagnoses Table and, therefore, as a primary or secondary diagnosis, if the Animal Naming Tool is administered and the score is less than 14 and the Mini-cog is administered with results of 0, 1, or 2. While these results are not verification of diagnosis of memory loss, they are acceptable evidence of memory loss and the screener may select Memory Loss based on these results. Refer to Module 4.3 Completing the Diagnoses Table. Safely: Means without significant risk of harm to oneself or others. Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7 DHS 10.33(1)(d). Significant, negative health outcome: A significant, negative health outcome has occurred when a person experiences any of the following symptoms: shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, exhaustion, falls, incontinence, or debilitating pain to the point where the individual is unsafe and another person should be present to help with some or all of the components of a task. Requiring additional time to complete a task is not a significant, negative health outcome in and of itself. 5.1 General Guidance for ADLs/IADLs A determination that an individual is limited in his or her capacity to perform an ADL or IADL task should always equate with a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment. - The screener should select the level of assistance needed based on the level of help needed from another person. - The screener should indicate the amount of help the person currently needs from another person, no matter who is providing the help. When a person is in the process of changing their residence, the screener should estimate what assistance the person might need in his/her new residence. - Screeners should select the level of assistance needed based on need and not solely on a diagnosis. - When a screener identifies a level of help needed in an ADL or IADL, the screener will select the diagnosis that correlates to the deficit. - If an individual has never performed or is not performing an activity or a task, a screener should not assume that the individual is physically or cognitively capable or incapable of doing so. - A lack of experience is not the same as the inability to perform a task due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment. - Although an individual may be currently receiving assistance with a task, they may be able to perform the activity independently or with limited assistance if given the opportunity and training. - For a person living in a residential facility, screeners should assess the person's actual need for assistance. Screeners should not select the level of help needed based on the services or equipment available as part of the residential facility package. NEED for Assistance To reflect a person's NEED for assistance, the screener should select the most accurate answer that most closely describes the person's NEED for \"help from another person,\" whether the person is actually receiving that assistance or not. Help from another person is defined as supervision, cueing, and/or hands-on assistance (partial or complete). - If a person has an identified need but is not receiving assistance (this includes declining the assistance and a significant, negative health outcome occurs), the screener should still capture the need for the assistance from another person to complete the task. - If a person has an identified need but they have declined assistance and there is no significant negative health outcome, the screener is to select Independent. - If a person has a legal guardian, an activated power of attorney for health care, or is currently involved with adult protective services, that person may be considered not able to perceive and recognize potential risks or negative health outcomes and the selection of a need might be appropriate. Declining a Task For the IADL Medication Administration and Medication Management, if the individual has declined the task of taking medications itself, and is able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should select \"NA - Has no medications\" for the IADL Medication Administration and Medication Management. In this situation, the person has no need for Medication Administration or Medication Management because it is not occurring. For example, if an individual able to perceive potential risk or negative outcome chooses not to take any prescribed medications, the person has no need for medication administration and medication management assistance because no medications are being taken (the task itself is not being done). - If the person is not able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should select the frequency of need. - If a person has a legal guardian, an activated power of attorney for health care, or is currently involved with adult protective services, that person may be considered not able to perceive and recognize potential risks or negative health outcomes, and the selection of a need might be appropriate. If a person can complete a task independently, but it takes him/her a very long time, a screener should consider if the person needs any help with that task to complete it safely. - If it takes so much time for the person to complete a task independently and that results in a significant, negative health outcome, then it would be justified to indicate the person has a need for help completing the task. - If an identified need is due to a significant, negative health outcome, the screener should write a note describing the significant, negative health outcome. When an individual's conditions and abilities fluctuate over time, reference Module 1.11 Screening Limitations and Strategies to Mitigate Limitations, Abilities Fluctuate, for assistance on how to complete the LTCFS. An individual's need for assistance with personal hygiene, such as grooming and mouth care, is not captured on the LTCFS. This information, as well as hygienic conditions of the home, can be captured in the notes section. It is not uncommon for an individual to underrate his or her need for help or overstate his or her independence. Screeners should use the following steps when assessing an individual's level of help needed: - Select the level of assistance required based on need and not solely on the report of the individual. - Seek more details and consider asking for a demonstration on how a task is completed. - Seek collateral informants, other people you could ask for additional information. - Use your professional judgment and assessment skills to select the best answer. Follow the definitions and instructions for the screen. Example: Bert tells you he does not need any help with bathing. He lives alone. He is unkempt and has body odor. He walks very unsteadily with a cane and is bent over. It is quite clear to you that he is not able to safely get in and out of his bathtub and that he, in fact, has not bathed for many weeks. - Step 1: Seek more details: You ask him if you can see his bathroom, where you notice he has a claw-foot bathtub with sides about two feet high off the floor (with no grab bars, bench, or non-slip mats). You observe his ambulation and ask him to lift his foot high for you. He lifts it about four inches. You ask him for details on how he gets in and out of the bathtub. - Step 2: Seek collateral informants: Bert's daughter referred him to the ADRC and is present during the screen interview. With Bert's approval, you speak to her privately on the way out to get her perspective on her dad's functioning. She says he is lying now because he is afraid, but he has admitted to her that he is unable to get into the bathtub. - Step 3: Use your professional judgment to select the best answer: You can see from Bert's general body movement that he would need help with all aspects of bathing and would require his helper to be present throughout the entire task. For Bathing, select box 2, \"Helper needs to be present throughout the task.\" 5.2 Communal Living Situations A screener may encounter a person living in a communal living situation or congregate living arrangement, like a dormitory, convent, or monastery. This person may lack experience performing certain tasks. Socioeconomic barriers, religious beliefs, or cultural norms may be factors that result in this person having fewer opportunities to perform select IADLs (e.g., making phone calls, managing a checkbook, driving, or food preparation). In a communal living situation, activities are often centralized and tasks assigned to certain individuals for the convenience of the community or setting. When a person resides in a communal living situation, do not presume ADL and IADL tasks cannot be performed by the person unless a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment is evident. Assume the person can be independent when the opportunity and training are provided to learn new tasks. When a person is receiving assistance with an ADL/IADL task, or has no experience performing the task, the screener must: - Ascertain whether a communal living situation, socioeconomic barriers, religious beliefs, or cultural norm factors result in the individual receiving assistance or lacking experience with a task. - Determine (if such factors are evident) whether there is a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment limiting the person's capacity to perform the task. Examples: - A college student living in a dormitory who has relied on his parents to manage his financial matters. Do not assume this student is unable to manage money and pay bills unless he has a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment limiting his ability to do so. - A nun has taken a vow of poverty and has spent her adult life in a convent. Financial resources have always been pooled and bills paid centrally. Money available to her has been limited to a small stipend. Do not assume this nun is unable to manage money and pay bills unless she has a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment limiting her ability to do so. - A large farm cooperative is managed by a religious order of monks living at the farm in a monastery. The monks have experience with farming tasks but not driving, shopping, or food preparation. When determining a monk's ability to perform these IADL tasks, assess for any functional or cognitive limitations that may diminish his capacity to perform these IADL tasks, not the inexperience or lack of training opportunities. 5.3 Coding for Who Will Help in the Next Eight Weeks The LTCFS requires screeners to indicate who will help in the next eight weeks for each ADL and most of the IADLs. The codes for this section are below. Screeners should check all that apply. - U: Current UNPAID caregiver will continue - PF: Current PUBLICLY FUNDED paid caregiver will continue - PP: Current PRIVATELY PAID caregiver will continue - N: Need to find new or additional caregiver(s) If the level of assistance needed for a particular ADL/IADL task is selected as \"0 - Independent\" or \"NA - Has no medications,\" the boxes for \"Who Will Help in the Next 8 Weeks?\" should be left blank. If it is determined that the person needs assistance with a task, it is mandatory to complete the \"Who Will Help in the Next 8 Weeks?\" category. In other words, if the \"Level of Help Needed\" is indicated for an ADL or IADL task as \"1\" or greater, the screener must select at least one of the \"Who Will Help in the Next 8 Weeks?\" boxes. \"PP - Current PRIVATELY PAID caregiver will continue\" means non-public funding, including the person's own money, that of a family member or friend, etc., private insurance (including long-term care insurance benefits), or a trust fund. \"PF - Currently Publicly Funded paid caregiver will continue\" means funded with public program assistance including but not limited to services funded by Medicare, Medicaid, waiver programs, Veterans Affairs, and any other federal, state, or county funding sources. Nursing Home or Hospital Resident If a person resides in a nursing home or hospital and discharge is not expected in the next eight weeks, indicate how the nursing home is being paid (Privately Paid or Publicly Funded). If the person is expected to be discharged within the next eight weeks, try to be as accurate as possible with the \"Who Will Help in the Next 8 Weeks?\" boxes. Record the help the person will need once at home. Many individuals are discharged to their own homes with a mixture of public, private, and unpaid care giving services. 5.4 Identifying Primary and Secondary Diagnoses To be selected as a primary or secondary diagnosis that causes a need for assistance or support from another person, the need must be due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment, with one exception as outlined in the section titled \"Exception to Physical, Cognitive, or Memory Loss Impairment Requirement.\" For each need or additional support, including some selections of adaptive equipment, identified in the LTCFS, the diagnoses that cause the need or necessary support must be selected from options prepopulated in a drop-down menu. Only diagnoses that were previously identified on the Diagnoses Table will be prepopulated in the drop-down menus. FSIA will use these diagnoses to assign the correct target group(s) for each individual who is being screened. Primary and secondary diagnoses carry equal weight in regard to assignment of target group by FSIA. One diagnosis must be selected from the drop-down menu under primary diagnosis for each need or support identified on the screen. Under secondary diagnosis, a selection must be made from the drop-down menu. If there is no secondary diagnosis contributing to the need for assistance, the screener must select \"None.\" When determining which diagnosis to select from the primary or secondary diagnosis drop-down menu, the screener is to be thoughtful and consistent. The diagnosis selected should justify and explain the need for assistance from another person. If there is only one diagnosis that affects the need for assistance, the screener would select \"None\" from the drop-down menu under secondary diagnosis. If a person has more than one diagnosis that corresponds to the person's need, the screener could choose one of the other diagnoses as the secondary diagnosis. However, if both diagnoses are clearly related to a single target group it is not necessary to list both of them on the functional screen. For example, a 74-year-old man needs assistance with getting into the shower due to right-sided weakness after a cerebral vascular accident (CVA). The diagnosis that corresponds to why he needs assistance is a CVA. If he also has a diagnosis of right hemiparesis (right-sided weakness) due to the CVA, while the diagnosis of right hemiparesis could be selected as secondary, it is not required because it is actually caused by the identified primary diagnosis and it clearly relates to the same target group. If the need for assistance is due to multiple diagnoses that are related to different target groups, the screener should select diagnoses from different categories on the Diagnoses Table. This is important for accurate assignment of target group(s). For example, a 43-year-old woman needs hands-on assistance with bathing due to obesity (B8) and cueing with bathing due to intellectual disability (A1). In this example, both the obesity and intellectual disability diagnoses should be selected; one from the drop-down menu under primary diagnosis and one from the drop-down menu under secondary diagnosis. The diagnosis of obesity is relevant to the Physical Disability target group and the diagnosis of intellectual disability is relevant to the Intellectual/Developmental Disability target group. A review of Module 2 Target Groups can provide some guidance as to what factors into each target group. Mental Health Diagnoses: For a mental illness to be selected as a primary or secondary diagnosis that causes a need for assistance or support from another person, the person must have a permanent impairment of thought due to a severe and persistent mental illness. A screener should always consider if the diagnosis creates a permanent cognitive impairment that cannot be controlled by medications or therapy, is not situational, or varying to the degree that the person can complete the task another time. In the notes, the screener should clearly state what it is about the diagnosis that makes it permanent and not able to be overcome to complete the task. A cognitive impairment in the LTCFS is defined as a permanent impairment of thought due to a severe and persistent mental illness, dementia, brain injury, intellectual/developmental disability, or other organic brain disorder. - A cognitive impairment does not include temporary impairment due to medications and/or substance use intoxication. - A cognitive impairment does not include temporary impairment due to a temporary medical condition such as infection, electrolyte imbalance, or dehydration. Exception to Physical, Cognitive, or Memory Loss Impairment requirement There are occasions when the need for assistance is not due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment. This is relevant only to certain skilled tasks captured on the HRS Table (Module 7) and IADL Medication Administration and Medication Management (Module 5.14). These skilled tasks may include Medication Administration, Medication Management, Ostomy-related Skilled Services, Oxygen and/or Respiratory Treatments, Dialysis, Transfusions, Tracheostomy care, Ulcer care, Urinary Catheter-related skilled tasks, Other Wound Cares, Ventilator-related interventions, RNAI, and Skilled Therapies. In these cases, the screener should determine why a primary or secondary diagnosis is selected even though it may not be the cause of a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment requiring assistance from another person. The screener must document this in the Notes section. Examples include (this is not an all-inclusive list): - A person who is paralyzed from the waist down has a stage 4 ulcer on their coccyx region requiring dressing changes every three days. He has no physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment preventing him from performing the wound care, but due to the location of the ulcer, he is unable to complete the needed care. In addition, due to the depth of the wound, the physician has ordered a wound care nurse to complete the wound care. The screener would select K4: Wound/Burn/Bedsore/Pressure Ulcer as the primary diagnosis for Ulcer - Stage 3 or 4 on the HRS Table and explain in the Notes section why this selection was made. - A person has a verified diagnosis of chronic pain treated with a Fentanyl patch. The patch is placed on her back, near the scapula, and the site is changed every three days. She does not have a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment, but cannot reach the site, and she requests assistance to place and remove the patch. The screener needs to confirm with the person or her medical professional if the patch must be placed in a location that she cannot reach, or if an alternate, accessible, location is possible. If the location of the patch does indeed need to be in an inaccessible spot, the screener would select D12: Other Chronic Pain or Fatigue as the primary diagnosis for Medication Administration and explain in the Notes section why this selection was made. - A person has a verified diagnosis of end-stage kidney disease and receives hemodialysis three times a week at a dialysis center. His need for assistance at a dialysis center is not due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment. The screener would select G1: Renal Failure, other Kidney Disease as the primary diagnosis for Dialysis on the HRS Table and explain in the Notes section why this selection was made. [](#top) 5.5 Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) The six ADLs include: - Bathing - Dressing - Eating - Mobility in Home - Toileting - Transferring ADL Coding for Level of Help Needed All of the ADLs have the same rating system for \"Coding for Level of Help Needed to Complete the Task Safely.\" When recording the level of help an individual needs to safely complete an ADL, a screener should select only one rating of \"Level of Help Needed\" with each ADL. The rating system used for ADLs in the LTCFS is below. - 0: Person is independent in completing the activity safely. - 1: Help is needed to complete the task safely but helper DOES NOT have to be physically present throughout the task. \"Help\" can be supervision, cueing, or hands-on assistance. - 2: Help is needed to complete the task safely and helper DOES need to be physically present throughout the task. \"Help\" can be supervision, cueing, and/or partial or complete hands-on assistance. ADL Adaptive Equipment Guidance Adaptive equipment is defined as specific types of equipment captured on the LTCFS that an individual may use to safely complete an ADL. Four of the ADLs (Bathing, Mobility in Home, Toileting, and Transferring) have some adaptive equipment options. Screeners should select only equipment the person currently needs, has, and is using. The only exception to \"need, have, and use\" is prosthesis in 5.9 Mobility in Home. Prosthesis should be selected if the person has a prosthesis; regular use or use only in the home are not requirements. Do not select one of the equipment options if a person uses an improvised or homemade item as a substitute for the equipment on the list. For example, a person may use a sturdy object to sit on during bathing instead of a tub bench. In this instance, you would not select \"Uses tub bench\" in the Bathing equipment box, because the object is a substitute for a tub bench. 5.6 Bathing LTCFS ITEM DEFINITION: Bathing: The ability to safely shower, bathe, or take a sponge bath for the purpose of maintaining adequate hygiene. The task of Bathing consists of the following components: - Getting in and out of the bathtub or shower. - Physically turning on and off the faucets and adjusting the water temperature as desired. - Determining the proper water temperature. (This component pertains only to people with a cognitive impairment.) - Washing and drying self. - Shampooing hair. The need for assistance with transferring to bathe is included in this task. If a person needs assistance with only accessing the bathroom, this need is captured in Module 5.9 Mobility in Home, not the Bathing task. CODING FOR LEVEL OF HELP NEEDED - 0: Person is independent in completing the activity safely. - 1: Help is needed to complete the task safely but helper DOES NOT have to be physically present throughout the task. \"Help\" can be supervision, cueing, and/or hands-on assistance. - 2: Help is needed to complete the task safely and helper DOES need to be present throughout the task. \"Help\" can be supervision, cueing, and/or partial or complete hands-on assistance. ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT Adaptive equipment is defined as specific types of equipment captured on the LTCFS that an individual may use to safely complete an ADL. Screeners should only select the adaptive equipment the person currently needs, has, and is using. Adaptive equipment options for Bathing include: - Uses Grab Bar(s) - Uses Shower Chair - Uses Bathtub Bench - Uses Mechanical Lift Do not select one of the equipment options if a person uses an improvised or homemade item as a substitute for the equipment on the list. For example, a person may use an object to sit on during bathing instead of a bathtub bench. In this instance, you would not select \"Uses Bathtub Bench\" in the Bathing equipment box, because the object is a substitute for a bathtub bench. BATHING-SPECIFIC RESPONSE GUIDANCE: The \"Check 0, 1, 2\" list contains common, illustrative examples. This list is not an all-inclusive list of examples. Check \"0\" (\"Person is independent in completing the activity safely\") for a person who: - Has no physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairments affecting his or her ability to complete the task of Bathing independently. - Bathes independently with the use of adaptive equipment. - Bathes independently with the use of simple, reasonable adaptations such as a hand-held washing aid, hand-held shower attachment, or a shampoo dispenser. - Is able to maintain adequate hygiene by bathing on good days. - Bathes independently but it takes additional time to do so and there are NO significant, negative health outcomes. - Uses an improvised or homemade item and without it, he or she would NOT need assistance from another person to complete the task. Do not check the use of any adaptive equipment if an improvised or homemade item is being used, since this is not considered adaptive equipment. - Requires assistance with grooming only (such as shaving, brushing hair, mouth care, nail care). Grooming is not considered an ADL on the LTCFS. - Prefers a sponge bath and can do so independently and maintains adequate hygiene. - Bathes independently but is unable to wash and/or dry his or her back. - Bathes independently but chooses not to do so unless a family member or staff is present somewhere in the home, \"just in case.\" - Bathes independently but needs toiletries (such as shampoo, soap, towels) retrieved and/or laid out for him or her. These needs are captured in Module 5.16 Laundry and/or Chores. - Has a seizure disorder with no seizures in the last three months and there is no intervention needed; however, family or staff is present \"just in case.\" Check \"1\" (\"Help is needed to complete the task safely but helper DOES NOT have to be physically present throughout the task\") for a person who: - Due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment requires supervision, cueing, and/or hands-on assistance with at least one but not all of the components of Bathing. - Bathes independently but doing so results in a significant, negative health outcome and another person should be present to help with SOME of the components of the task. - Uses an improvised or homemade item and without it, he or she would need assistance from another person to complete at least one but not all of the components of Bathing. Do not check the use of any adaptive equipment if an improvised or homemade item is being used, since this is not considered adaptive equipment. - Bathes independently but, due to a cognitive impairment, regularly requires cueing or else he or she would not initiate the task of bathing. - Prefers to sponge bathe but does not maintain adequate hygiene due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment. Check \"2\" (\"Help is needed to complete the task safely and helper DOES need to be present throughout the task\") for a person who: - Due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment requires supervision, cueing, and/or partial or complete hands-on assistance with ALL of the above components of Bathing. - Bathes independently but doing so results in a significant, negative health outcome and another person should be present to help with ALL of the components of the task. - Uses an improvised or homemade item and without it, he or she would need assistance from another person to complete ALL of the components of Bathing. Do not check the use of any adaptive equipment if an improvised or homemade item is being used, since this is not considered adaptive equipment. - Requires assistance with ALL of the components of Bathing but he or she can be left alone to soak in the bathtub (without negative health and/or safety concerns). Soaking in the bathtub is not a component of the Bathing ADL. - Requires supervision due to having an uncontrolled seizure disorder, evidenced by one or more seizures in the last three months AND requires standby assistance* during the entire task of Bathing. *Standby assistance for seizure is defined as the need for a person to be next to the individual (within arm's length) in order to be readily available to help the individual in the event he or she experiences a seizure. 5.7 Dressing LTCFS ITEM DEFINITION: Dressing: The ability to safely dress and undress as necessary. The task of Dressing consists of the following components: - Dressing/undressing the top half of body (includes putting on undergarments) - Dressing/undressing the bottom half of body (includes putting on undergarments) - Getting shoes and socks on and off - Putting on or removing prostheses, orthotic devices, anti-embolism hose (TED hose), compression products or devices (stockings, bandages, pumps), and/or pressure relieving devices, if applicable. - Choosing the appropriate clothing to maintain health and safety for the environment and setting. (This component pertains only to people with a cognitive impairment.) CODING FOR LEVEL OF HELP NEEDED - 0: Person is independent in completing the activity safely. - 1: Help is needed to complete the task safely but helper DOES NOT have to be physically present throughout the task. \"Help\" can be supervision, cueing, and/or hands-on assistance. - 2: Help is needed to complete the task safely and helper DOES need to be present throughout the task. \"Help\" can be supervision, cueing, and/or partial or complete hands-on assistance. ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT This is not applicable for this ADL. There are no adaptive equipment options listed under \"Dressing.\" DRESSING-SPECIFIC RESPONSE GUIDANCE: The \"Check 0, 1, 2\" list contains common, illustrative examples.

Examples include: - Pain medicine that is ordered PRN but taken every four to six hours, every day. - Skin cream that is ordered PRN but applied every week. - A medication to relieve menstrual symptoms, such as Midol, that is ordered PRN but used once every month. - Sliding scale insulin (where the exact dosage is adjusted according to the blood glucose level) can be treated as a regularly scheduled medication, because it is regularly given, with the dose merely adjusted to blood glucose level. The following are not considered medications on the LTCFS: - PRN medications that do not meet the definition of a medication. - Vitamin (unless injected, such as vitamin B-12 injections), mineral, supplement, and alternative or complementary medicines, even if prescribed by a Medicaid-recognized prescriber. - Non-vitamin, non-mineral natural substances such as omega 3 or fish oil, glucosamine, ginkgo, anti-oxidants, ginseng, echinacea, chondroitin, coenzyme seed, milk thistle, lutein, barkwater, or shark cartilage, even if prescribed by a Medicaid-recognized prescriber. - Other complementary or alternative medicines such as a homeopathic, naturopathic, or herbal therapy; or other treatment such as aromatherapy, flower remedies, crystal or magnet therapy, chelation, bowel cleansing, detoxifier, acupuncture, or acupressure. - Other dietary supplements with calories, minerals, vitamins, and/or other additives. In the IADLs, Medication Administration and Medication Management are coded together. This differs from the HRS Table where Medication Administration and Medication Management are coded separately. The LTCFS application will check to ensure that the level of help indicated in the IADL Medication Administration and Medication Management correlates with the Medication Administration and Medication Management tasks on the HRS Table. If the level of help does not correlate between that IADL task and the Medication Administration and Medication Management tasks on the HRS Table, the screener will receive an error message to prompt review. LTCFS ITEM DEFINITION: Medication Administration: A person's need for assistance from another person to take or be given a medication by any route except intravenously (IV). This could be by mouth, under the tongue, injection, onto or into the body, rectally, vaginally, by feeding tube, or by inhaler. Common forms of medication include but are not limited to tablet, capsule, liquid, drops, and skin preparations. The person's need for assistance from another person in order to use a prescribed medication that is regularly scheduled and used should be captured here. The preparation of medications, such as crushing a tablet to be diluted or measuring to fill a syringe or dosage cup, may be considered Medication Administration when it is prepared within one hour of when the dose is to be taken. Excluded are: - IV medications. This need is captured in Module 7.13 IV Medications, Fluids, or Line Flushes - Topical medications used for ulcer, wound care. This need is captured in Modules 7.24 Ulcer-Stage 2, 7.25 Ulcer-Stage 3 or 4, or 7.27 Other Wound Cares - Medications used for nebulizer treatments. This need is captured in Module 7.18 Oxygen and/or Respiratory Treatments LTCFS ITEM DEFINITION: Medication Management: A person's need for assistance from another person to set up or monitor his or her prescribed and regularly scheduled and used medications. The two components of Medication Management include: 1.) Medication Set-Up: To separate out the proper dosage and set it aside for later use by the individual. Medication set-up is completed for several reasons. One reason is to ensure the proper medication, at the proper dosage is selected when the individual is unable to select it due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment. Another reason is to arrange the medications to help the person remember to take them at proper times and to make it easier to tell that medications were or were not taken. Examples of medication set-ups: - Medication boxes with compartments labeled for different times and each day of the week, into which pills are placed. - Any other \"set-up\" system in which medications and dosages are preselected by another person, such as a bubble pack. - Automated medication dispensers, such as a CompuMed, that can be programmed (often weekly) to dispense pills. - Prefilling of syringes, such as insulin syringes. Medication set-ups are commonly used for convenience in organizing and remembering one's medications, even by people with no physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairments. When a person uses a medication set-up, the screener needs to determine whether due to a physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment the person needs to use the medication set-up, and/or needs the assistance of another person to fill it. The preparation of medications, such as crushing a tablet to be diluted or measuring to fill a syringe or dosage cup, may be considered Medication Management when it is NOT prepared within one hour of when the dose is to be taken. 2.) Medication Monitoring Medication monitoring includes the following components: - Due to a memory loss or cognitive impairment, oversight is required for monitoring of effects, side effects, or adjustments. This oversight is captured at a frequency of one to three times per month. - The need to collect medication-related data, as ordered by the prescriber, prior to administering a medication, such as blood glucose level, blood pressure, or heart rate, and that the data collection is occurring. - The need to collect medication-related data, as ordered by the prescriber, such as vital signs, weights, seizure activity or in-home assistance to draw blood for a lab test, and that the data collection is occurring and reported to a health care provider. Common reasons for a need for assistance with Medication Monitoring (this is not an all-inclusive list of examples): - Uncontrolled Seizure Disorder. An individual's need for assistance in his or her residence from another person when the individual has an uncontrolled seizure disorder, evidenced by one or more seizures in the last three months, and medication is frequently adjusted. - Pain Management. An individual's need for assistance from another person to adjust his or her medications, in the individual's residence, in order to manage pain. This does not include care at a pain clinic or any other setting outside the person's residence. This also does not include prescription or OTC PRN medications that do not meet the definition of a Medication as described at the beginning of this module. - Blood Levels. A person's need for assistance from another person to draw blood samples, in his or her residence, for laboratory tests. The majority of these tasks are related to medications such as Pro-Times to regulate Coumadin administration or potassium levels for a person on diuretics. Blood levels also include \"finger-sticks\" for capillary blood to test blood glucose levels. If the person's condition is unstable and medication is frequently adjusted, then the need for medication monitoring may be several times per week or even daily. The condition or treatment may stabilize over time and then the frequency of medication monitoring would decrease. A rescreen should be completed when a person's condition stabilizes to reflect this and any other changes. CODING FOR LEVEL OF HELP NEEDED - N/A: Has no medications - 0: Independent - 1: Needs help 1 to 2 days a week or less often - 2a: Needs help at least once a day 3-7 days per week\u2014CAN direct the task - 2b: Needs help at least once a day 3-7 days per week\u2014CANNOT direct the task Considering \"can direct the task\" versus \"cannot direct the task\" As listed on the LTCFS, the distinction between \"can direct the task\" and \"cannot direct the task\" applies only if the person needs help at the higher frequency of \"at least once a day 3-7 days per week.\" If the person needs help less often than 3-7 days per week, the screener does not need to make a determination about the person's ability to direct the task of taking or withholding his or her medications. A person cannot direct the task of managing his or her medication if, due to a cognitive or memory loss impairment, the person needs a cue to take his or her medication. To code cueing assistance for a medication, the cue must be done within an hour of when the dose is to be taken. In addition, not every person with a cognitive impairment will be unable to direct the task of managing his or her medication. Some individuals with a cognitive limitation can independently take his or her medication as prescribed, without misuse or error, once the medication is set up. For such a person, the selection of \"1: Needs some help 1-2 days per week or less often,\" would be applicable. MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION and MEDICATION MANAGEMENT-SPECIFIC RESPONSE GUIDANCE: The \"Check NA, 0, 1, 2a, 2b\" list contains common, illustrative examples. This list is not an all-inclusive list of examples. Check \"N/A\" (Has no medications) for a person who: - Has no medications. - Does not take regularly scheduled medication but needs assistance from another person with an infrequently taken prescription PRN medication (taken less than once a month every month). Such a PRN medication does not meet the LTCFS definition of a medication. Refer to the PRN Medication definition. - Chooses not to take any medications (the person is declining the task of taking medications itself). If the individual has declined the task of taking medications itself, and is able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should select \"NA-Has no medications.\" In this situation, the person has no need for Medication Administration or Medication Management because it is not occurring. For example, if an individual able to perceive potential risk or negative outcome chooses not to take any prescribed medications, the person has no need for medication administration and medication management assistance because no medications are being taken (the task itself is not being done). - If the person is not able to perceive and recognize the potential risk or negative health outcome that could result from declining the task, the screener should select the frequency of need. - If a person has a legal guardian, an activated power of attorney for health care, or is currently involved with adult protective services, that person may be considered not able to perceive and recognize potential risks or negative health outcomes, and the selection of a need might be appropriate. Check \"0\" (Independent) for a person who: - Has no physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment affecting his or her ability to complete the task of Medication Administration and Medication Management independently. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management with the use of simple, reasonable adaptations, such as large-print or Braille labels, \"talking\" glucometer, easy-open pill bottles. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management and uses an alarm on their watch, clock, or phone as a reminder to take medications. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management and uses an automated pill dispenser such as, CompuMed. - Has no physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment affecting his or her ability to complete the task of Medication Administration and Medication Management independently, but: - Prefers assistance with Medication Administration and Medication Management due only to a gender, age, or cultural norm. - Needs assistance with Medication Administration and Medication Management due only to a language barrier. - Needs assistance with Medication Administration and Medication Management due only to illiteracy. - Requires Medication Administration and Medication Management assistance less often than monthly. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management as prescribed, and receives services outside his or her residence, such as: - Has medication monitoring, including blood draws, done outside the person's residence, such as at the physician's office, clinic, pharmacy, or health care facility. - Receives injections, such as vitamin B-12 or Depo-Provera, outside his or her residence, such as at a clinic. - Takes medication through an intrathecal drug pump, also known as a pain pump or internal morphine pump, that requires only intermittent refills and maintenance in the clinic setting, but does not require monitoring in their residence. - Has a drug delivery implant, such as the birth control implant, Implanon. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management, takes medication as prescribed, is able to contact the prescriber with concerns, and understands the prescriber's recommendations. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management, takes medication as prescribed, and is able to independently collect medication-related data, such as blood glucose levels, blood pressure, weights, or pulse. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management and independently sets up and uses his or her medication box. - Is independent with Medication Administration Medication Management and uses a medication box as a convenience. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management and has an unorthodox system of organizing medications, but has no history of medication misuse or errors. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management; however, a lock box is used: - Due to the policy of their provider agency (such as a hospice agency or personal care provider agency). - To prevent another person or a pet from having access to the medication. - Solely due to suicidal ideations or substance use issues. - Due to taking their medication other than as prescribed. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management; however, needs assistance to prevent someone else, including a pet from having access to the medication. - Is independent with Medication Administration and Medication Management but needs assistance reordering or obtaining medication refills.

Medication boxes are typically filled at the \"1 to 3 times/month\" frequency, since two or more medication boxes can be prefilled at one time. If this usual method does not work well for an individual due to their physical, cognitive, or memory loss impairment, more frequent medication set-up may be necessary. - Only requires assistance with prefilling insulin syringes as they can typically be completed weekly, since prefilled syringes can be stored in the refrigerator for a week. This task should be indicated at the \"Weekly\" frequency on the HRS Table. - Only requires assistance with measuring medication from a larger container to a smaller dosage cup as this can typically be completed weekly. This task should be indicated at the \"Weekly\" frequency on the HRS Table. - Has a cognitive or memory loss impairment but takes medication as prescribed, without misuse or error, once the medication is set up. - Only requires oversight due to a memory loss or cognitive impairment for monitoring of effects, side effects, or adjustments.

The task of Money Management consists of the following components: - Having a basic understanding of a monetary transaction; for example, an individual knows they need money to complete a transaction at a store and they know they have enough money to complete the transaction (this component pertains only to people with a cognitive or memory loss impairment). - Having an understanding of how to allocate or budget money to pay bills needed for meeting the basic necessities of food, shelter, and clothing (this component pertains only to people with a cognitive or memory loss impairment). - Having the physical ability to complete a transaction and pay bills (this component pertains only to people with a physical impairment). Money Management does not include when a person without a cognitive impairment makes money management choices consistent with his or her lifestyle, values, and goals, even if those choices do not align with the screener's or other persons' values or goals. Examples include a person who spends a majority of their money on gambling, drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes. A screener must review a person's ability to manage money even if a person has formal or informal supports who assist the individual with money management; for example, do not assume a person cannot manage their money even if they have a representative payee, durable power of attorney, power of attorney, authorized representative, activated power of attorney for health care decisions, designated power of attorney for health care decisions, conservatorship, guardian of the person, or guardian of estate.
