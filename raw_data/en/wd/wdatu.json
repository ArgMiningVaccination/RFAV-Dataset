Willow Domestic Violence Center President Meaghan de Chateauvieux is among those who had an allergic reaction to her first dose. While side effects to vaccines are normal, Rochester Regional's lead physician of allergy and immunology tells Spectrum News only two to four people per million have a true allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine. Allergists there have been able to give them their second doses in what's called a graded fashion, spreading the dose across several shots in two hours. \"You're always surprised a little bit in medicine. We think it'll be just as effective to give it in five doses versus one, but we can't be sure of it. But we are going to for our two patients, out of an abundance of caution check for some antibody response to see if they still responded as we would expect. There's no reason to think that they wouldn't,\" said Dr. S. Shahzad Mustafa. \"We don't really know how to handle COVID and we still don't have a strong understanding of it as a medical community. So the fear of an allergic reaction was far less than the fear of catching this virus or spreading it,\" added de Chateauvieux. Dr. Mustafa says that, as far as he knows, this is the first time that's been done with the COVID-19 vaccine, and they have submitted their work for publication. "}
