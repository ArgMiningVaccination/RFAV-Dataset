The HSE Spring Booster Vaccination Pro gramme is now underway in line with National Immunisation Guidance Committee (NIAC) recommendations. The following groups should get a Spring booster dose if they have not had a COVID -19 vaccine or COVID -19 infection in the last 6 months: those aged 70 ye ars and older. those living in long term care facilities for older adults. those aged 5 years and older with immunocompromise associated with a suboptimal response to vaccination *. *Note: Described in public communications as those with a 'weak immune syst em' and listed in more detail on the HSE -system -list. Please also refer to section 2.1 of the Clinical Guidance (page s 8-9). Eligible individuals can be offered the Spring booster at a 3 months interval after their last COVID -19 vaccine or infection to ensure they get their Spring booster before the end of May. If they had a booster since 1 March 2023, they have had their spring booste r. While the Spring booster programme is aimed for completion by the end of May, it is recognised that in some cases, given the timeframe, vaccinations may run into June. Ideally all spring boosters should be completed by 16th June so that there is an adeq uate interval before their Autumn booster. If eligible patients from the groups listed above come forward for a Spring booster after 16th June, then clinical discretion should be used to assess the risk, benefit and impact on Autumn booster timing before administering a Spring booster. Outside of the Spring booster programme, certain cohorts can get their COVID -19 vaccine at any time of the year. These include: those who are due any COVID -19 vaccine during pregnancy, including primary courses and any boost er individuals getting their primary course, additional dose or first booster For full NIAC guidance, please refer to tion/hcpinfo/covid19vaccineinfo4hps/ For any clinical queries please contact immunisation@hse.ie . I would like once again to express my sincere gratitude to Pharmacists and their teams for the efficient manner in which the COVID -19 Vaccination Programme has been delivered to date. I would also like to wish you and your pharmacy team every success in delivering the Spring booster vaccinations. Please be assured of the HSE's continued support at this time.
