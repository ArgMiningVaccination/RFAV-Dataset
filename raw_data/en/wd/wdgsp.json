The guided meditations were fabulous! I'd highly recommend this workshop for anyone looking for a couple of hours escape - I arrived exhausted and left energised and rejuvenated!\" ABOUT THE COURSE A progressive series of nature-led meditation workshops, each with an individual flavour. Jonathon will guide you gently through meditations and natural connection practices designed to restore your connection with nature and to bring healing to yourself and to the land to which we belong. Take some time in our peaceful woods to find calmness and connections with the landscape. It would be beneficial to attend all four evenings to deepen your learning experience, but you can just attend a single workshop. May Workshop - The Inner Landscape This evening will be spent exploring nature and connecting with the local landscape. Finding a calm place of support with your own natural affinities in life is a building block in discovering a personal practice that works for you. We shall connect with an inner landscape and animals as guides to create a meaningful relationship between nature and yourself. June Workshop - A Connection to Nature Discover the indigenous beliefs of the ancestors of the land which surrounds you, an awareness of Mother Nature and the relevance of seeing nature as a living entity. In this session we will draw from the culture of the British landscape to foster that deep connection with the earth. July Workshop - Woodland Folklore and Plant Allies A simple tree or plant has an ability to awaken a joy within us, there is no need to go on retreat or live in the wilds on nuts and berries, you simply need to be and create that space to experience that one pure moment that can infiltrate your entire life. In this session we will explore our innate connection to the plant world and explore tree folklore through ancient nature traditions borne from the local landscape. September Workshop - The Power of Story The final session of the year will bring together the key practices of Nature connection by exploring the ancient stories that encourage a deep connection to the land and the common thread that unites our humanity. Jonathon will be drawing from the Irish tradition and how it resonates with the challenges facing the natural world today. Nurturing a spiritual connection can help steady us in a changing world.
