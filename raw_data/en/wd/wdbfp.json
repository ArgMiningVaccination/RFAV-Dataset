My pricing is divided under 2 categories: Naturopathic medicine or Acupuncture. When I see client's under the Naturopathic umbrella, I spend a bit more time up front in order to understand how the person before me arrived at the state of health they are in today. I often order additional testing and the approach I use to treatment typically includes dietary and lifestyle changes and a variety of herbal, homeopathic and nutritional supplements to restore balance. The first visit is $220 and takes about 1-1.5 hours; the first follow up is included in this fee. Supplements and testing are in addition to the initial visit fee. Future visits are based on the amount of time we spend and vary from $40-$120. Under the Acupuncture pricing- The first visit is $80 and subsequent visits are $60. The first visit takes about an hour. The intake is taken based on the traditional Chinese medicine model of diagnosis. I then perform acupuncture, cupping, infrared heat therapy and/or electrical stimulation if indicated. Often, a Chinese herbal formula is prescribed to take in-between acupuncture visits to help restore balance. Herbal formulas are an additional cost and range between $20-$30 for a 10 day supply. Dietary recommendations and lifestyle changes are often recommended if it appears that during the intake, these patterns will prevent the person from restoring health. - What is your typical process for working with a new customer? I request that all patients fill out their initial intake paperwork online via my electronic health record system. Once we have established a first appointment date and time, I will enroll them in the EHR system using their name, date of birth, zip code and email address. The questionnaire(s) take(s) about 20-30 minutes to fill out depending on the complexity of the medical history. It is completed online and can be filled out on most smart phones. - What education and/or training do you have that relates to your work? I have a doctorate degree in Naturopathic Medicine and a master's degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine. I also have a bachelor's degree in Psychology and associate degree in Respiratory Therapy. "}
