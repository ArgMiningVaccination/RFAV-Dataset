This prominent site was part of the 2015 PanAm/ParaPanAm Games Athletes' Village, and is adjacent to the thriving Distillery District, the new Cherry Streetcar line and near the popular Corktown Common. The new Anishnawbe Health Toronto building will be the first project on the site of a new Indigenous Community Hub for the city at this location. Anishnawbe Health Foundation is mounting a campaign to fund the building and to support programs at the new Centre. Storytelling & Traditional Teachings Join Anishnawbe Health Toronto for a series of storytelling presentations on enduring troubling times, surviving challenges, keeping families strong, and emerging stronger for it all.
