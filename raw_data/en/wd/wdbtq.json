P | 3 Hach\u00e9 Protocol Immune Boosting Plan If anyone could be the poster child for the effectiveness of natural pain resolution and microcurrent therapy, it would be Rob Vanbergen. As a child, Rob suffered from both debilitating anxiety and extensive scoliosis issues. Neither holistic nor conventional medical remedies brought relief. But when Rob's parents, Drs. John and Lorry Hache, developed the Hache Protocol for Pain Resolution and had him follow it, his issues were resolved. He now enjoys vibrant and lasting physical and mental health. Rob has also found the Protocol to be invaluable in parenting his autistic son, James. He has found that James readily accepts the gentle procedures introduced by these therapies, which help bring on a state of relaxed calm that eases the stresses of everyday life. Rob also used it when an incident in James' life resulted in a broken foot. After just two weeks of microcurrent therapy his foot had healed completely. Doctors agreed that it was a near-miraculous recovery.After experiencing the healing properties of The Hache Protocol, Rob joined his parents - Dr. John and Dr. Lorry Hache - at Pacific Health Options. He obtained his Bachelors in Holistic Health Sciences from Quantum University in Hawaii in 2019. In addition to his knowledge and certification in Microcurrent Therapy, Rob is a Certified HHP (Holistic Healthcare Practitioner) with training in Biofeedback, Neurofeedback, Hypnotherapy, Homeopathy, Aromatherapy, Auriculotherapy, and Counseling. He is currently pursuing his PhD in Natural Medicine. A veteran instructor on the use of the Hache Protocol for Pain Resolution Rob has devoted his professional life to educating people about the effectiveness of natural pain management methods in relieving pain and anxiety and initiating healing in the body. Rob Vanbergen, HHP She is also a certified biofeedback specialist. In 1999, Dr. Lorry was introduced to Microcurrent Therapy. She was soon sought out by a Russian device company to run and organize the British and European sector for the sales, marketing, distribution and training of these devices. Two years later, Dr. Lorry participated in the creation of an Electro Dermal Evaluation medical device known as the \"BioEnergoMetre,\" and founded Pacific Health Options with her Life Partner, Dr. John Hach\u00e9 . Dr. Lorry Hach\u00e9 is the founder of the \"Cellular Makeover\" protocol, the first venture into using the field of microcurrent to repair the body at a \"Cellular Level\" and reverse the ravages of aging. Her book, Cellular Makeover, has been used by clients and professionals in the cosmetic industry to manage the effects of aging. Along with her life partner, Dr. John Hach\u00e9 , Dr. Lorry Hach\u00e9 has been involved with clinical studies as well as lecturing at many organizations worldwide, and works to create custom protocols for the clinics' patients using The Hach\u00e9 Protocol for Pain Resolution.P | 4 Hach\u00e9 Protocol Immune Boosting Plan With increasing concern growing worldwide due to the widespread nature of COVID-19, we developed the Hache Protocol Immune Boosting Plan to help support you in maintaining optimal immune function. These simple-to-follow instructions will protect you year-round. Nutrition Nutrition is a fundamental element to any healthy body. When your focus is boosting the immune system, we suggest including these vital nutritional elements in your diet: Eat a balanced, healthy diet: What does it mean to eat a healthy diet? It's a diet that includes clean, whole foods and a variety of fruits and vegetables, and avoids ingredients that compromise the immune system (such as refined sugar and oils, white flour, and artificial ingredients). Vitamin D: Vitamin D has been shown to reduce the severity and length of many illnesses. 10,000 IU of vitamin D taken daily is what we recommend for home treatment for acute immune system protection. If you find yourself sick that amount can be increased all the way up to 150,000 IU per day. The best-absorbing type of Vitamin D-3 we have found is the Spray For Life \u00ae NanoSyzed Vitamin D-3 spray. Vitamin C: Currently, vitamin C is being used intravenously in China to treat patients with COVID-19. As an alternative for preventive use, we suggest using the Spray for Life \u00ae NanoSyzed formulation because it provides rapid and more complete absorption, and also includes zinc, a powerful immune supporting mineral. 240 mg per day (split up into several doses throughout the day) will be an efficient dosage when using Spray for Life \u00ae NanoSyzed formulation. When using other forms of vitamin C supplements, we suggest taking up to 4000 mg daily, because your body can't as readily absorb it - split this into FOUR 1000mg doses taken throughout the day. Homeopathic medicine as a preventative measure: Antimonium Tartaricum 30 CH is a homeopathic medicine that supports respiratory health. As a preventative measure, you can start taking 3 tablets once a week to aid in supporting lungs and airways. Increased protein intake: You can build a proper immune response by eating more protein than sugar. Sugar is like gasoline on a fire for inflammation and should be avoided. You can find protein in meat, eggs, cheese, legumes, tofu, and soy products. The most important measure you can take today in protecting yourself from all forms of illness is to promote a healthy immune system. Think of your immune system as a shield; it guards you against bacteria and viruses, keeping you safe and healthy.CREATING YOUR IMMUNITY SHIELDP | 5 Hach\u00e9 Protocol Immune Boosting Plan Minimizing Stress Your body does not repair itself when you are in fight or flight mode. When you are stressed, your immune system and adrenals take a nosedive, leading to a weakened immune response. This makes your body more susceptible to contracting an illness. If you are feeling stressed, try calming yourself through methods such as yoga, mindfulness, or breathing exercises, and set boundaries on how much of your mental space you are willing to dedicate to stressful situations. If you have an Avazzia Evolution or Pro Sport III microcurrent device and the Alpha Ear Clips attachment, you can use this protocol to help reduce stress: There is no downside to this therapy, and many people opt to do it throughout the day. If you are an easily stressed individual, then we strongly recommend treating for at least an hour a day. Exercise Whether it be practicing yoga, following an online workout, or going for a walk around your neighborhood, it's essential to keep the blood moving. Regular exercise boosts the immune system and keeps your body in optimum shape to fight off illness. 1. Attach the ear clips and set the device to a mode that operates between 7-12 Hz.2. Adjust the power to a comfortable level and treat for as long as you like. A Note from Dr. Hach\u00e9 About 5G Are you EMF Sensitive? 5G has already rolled out worldwide. Over the course of 2019, EMF sensitivity sky rocketed with the rollout of 5G networks. This is a huge topic in itself, and we have covered it extensively in our article 5G Effects on Health: Should You be Concerned? The big concern here is that EMFs have a DRAMATIC impact on the strength of our immune system which is thrown into disarray by the signals, and constantly depleted of its resources. We recently partnered with Dr. Keith Scott-Mumby to host an extensive webinar on 5G and its impact on our immune systems, for those interested in this, and the solution we recommend, check out the video here: W atch: Mystery Illness, EMFs, 5G, and Beyond P | 6 Hach\u00e9 Protocol Immune Boosting Plan You have now completed a \"circuit.\" You will want to perform 5 circuits in each microcurrent therapy session. We recommend using the Bell Electrodes when performing this protocol for an easier glide, and an easier time dodging the Thyroid. Y-Electrode With the Y-Electrode attachment, start vertically at the paraspinal on the side of complaint and move the device horizontally around the neck. Once you reach the thyroid gland, gently switch the Y- Electrode to the horizontal position to avoid tracking over the thyroid then right the device to a vertical position once again stopping at the paraspinal area with the electrode righted vertically. Reverse the movement around the neck in the opposite direction, once again avoiding the thyroid. Pay attention to stickiness or drag against the electrode. If this does happen, you may want to pause and paint the area a bit, then resume treatment. Continue around the neck ending once again para-spinally.Comprehensive Immune Booster Protocol PART 1: PIROGOV'S RING Pirogov's Ring is a gentle protocol that works on the throat and mucus membranes. It is used to treat respiratory infections such as rhinitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, and other symptoms involving the mouth, teeth, and parotid gland. INSTRUCTIONS: This protocol can be executed with the following microcurrent devices set to the indicated frequencies:Avazzia Pro-Sport III- AVA 90 HzAvazzia Life Evolution- 77Hz Microcurrent Therapy If you're wondering if microcurrent therapy can aid in keeping your body healthy and immune system functioning correctly, the answer is yes! We would like to share with you a protocol that is particularly helpful in supporting immune health. Comprehensive Immune Booster Protocol This microcurrent protocol consists of three parts to work on three important elements of the human immune system: throat and mucus membranes; white blood cells; and immune supporting organs (thymus, liver, and spleen). P | 7 Hach\u00e9 Protocol Immune Boosting Plan Comprehensive Immune Booster Protocol PART 2: BUILDING NEW WHITE BLOOD CELLS This part of the protocol works to boost the immune response, accelerate healing, and combat infections by building new white blood cells. It works by treating the epiphysis of the bones, which houses the immune system. This protocol is useful in many cases involving viruses and bacteria. Start at your left heel; bring it to dose. Behind the left knee, bring it to dose. Now focus on the left hip joint, bring it to dose. Then focus on the right shoulder blade, bring it to dose, then the right elbow, bring it to dose, right wrist, bring it to dose. Start at right hip joint and work down to behind the right knee, then the right heel, then the left heel, then the left knee, then the left hip joint. Start at right hip joint and work down to behind the right knee, then the right heel, then the left heel, then the left knee, then the left hip joint. On day three, you will make two patterns of treatment: Left wrist, left elbow, left shoulder, right shoulder, right elbow, then right wrist. Start at the left heel, left knee, left hip joint, left shoulder, left elbow, then left wrist. Then do the same order on the right side for maximum results. Day 1 Day 2Day 3 Day 4INSTRUCTIONS: This protocol is performed over several days. You can use any of the following microcurrent devices on the indicated setting:Avazzia Pro-Sport III Relax Assess Avazzia Life Evolution 60 Hz Avazzia Med-Sport Relax P | 8 Hach\u00e9 Protocol Immune Boosting Plan Outline of enlarged spleen The thymus is where white blood cells we have created when we have treated the long bones, are stored and waiting to be released. Move from the suprasternal notch downwards to the bottom of the ribcage. Make sure to clear sticky spots, 30 seconds should be sufficient. Liver SpleenComprehensive Immune Booster Protocol PART 3: OPTIMIZING When conducting the Comprehensive Immune Booster Protocol, this step will need to be completed each day after each step of the previous protocol. Part 3 is important because it optimizes your thymus, liver, and spleen. These organs are integral support systems to your immune system, and you want to make sure they are clear and functioning properly. INSTRUCTIONS: For treating the thymus, liver, or spleen set your device to the following settings:Avazzia Pro-Sport III AVA 90 Hz Avazzia Life Evolution 77Hz Thymus The liver works to clear out the lymph and flushes out the viruses and bacteria the lymph catches. Paint over the entire surface of the liver to remove active zones and cleanse the area, making sure your system can flush out toxins. The spleen is where tumor necrosing factors are created. Paint over the surface of the spleen to remove active zones and ensure this critical facet of the immune system is working optimally.P | 9 Hach\u00e9 Protocol Immune Boosting Plan Comprehensive Immune Booster Protocol PART 4: CHARGE YOUR CELLS TO PRODUCE HYPOCHLORUS ACID! Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is the perfect weapon to fight germs. It hits hard against dangerous pathogens, but this powerful weapon is 100% safe for humans, chemical free, non-toxic and all-natural. That's an impressive combination. HOCl is a weak acid that occurs naturally in our body. White blood cells release this natural oxidant to fight invading pathogens. It has been used in the medical field for over a century. Before antibiotics were available, it was used to irrigate and disinfect wounds in World War I. Today, HOCl is commonly used in everyday settings including daycare centers, hospitals, and even produce sections in grocery stores. How does the body use HOCl to kill germs? Neutrophils are white blood cells that are the first to arrive on site when an invading pathogen is detected. A neutrophil will chase down and engulf a pathogen through phagocytosis, a process by which the neutrophil ingests the pathogen by surrounding it with its plasma membrane. Upon contact, neutrophils release a burst of bactericidal chemicals including its most powerful oxidizing agent, HOCl. This kills the pathogen by tearing down the cell membranes and proteins. How is HOCl produced in the body? Your body makes HOCI from its plentiful endogenous supply of biochemicals. Salt, Water and an electrical charge is all that is needed to produce the most powerful antibacterial, antifungal compound yet known to science. If any of the needed ingredients are missing, the body's defences quickly depreciate. One of these elements is electricity. A drop in electrical charge and you have a drop in the capacity to produce phagocytosis or the engulfing of harmful pathogens. Harnessing Your Body's Immune Response with Microcurrent Fortunately, we can use microcurrent to assist the body in manufacturing this important element of the immune system. This process will provide the final component that the body needs in order to create Hypochlorus Acid! The body is already mostly made up of water. It also contains salt. When an electrical charge passes through the cells, it activates this process and the acid is formed. This acid is a highly effective antimicrobial solution that fights infection: bacterial, viral, and fungal. Step 1 Set one conductive pad on the sole of each foot, and the palm of each hand *Step 2 Set your device to Blue Stimulate Step 3 Run the device for 20 minutes *Please note that you will need the 2x R/B Leadwire to accomplish this. If you do not have it, you can do one hand and one foot at a time.P | 10 Hach\u00e9 Protocol Immune Boosting Plan In today's global environment, preventive health care has never been more important. By eating a healthy and balanced diet, supplementing with vitamin C and vitamin D, and utilizing the Comprehensive Immune Booster Protocol with your microcurrent device, you can know that you are taking the necessary steps to optimize immune system function and stay healthy naturally.TAKE IMMUNITY INTO YOUR OWN HANDS For Continued Support... to help you live a healthy, pain-free life\u2014including access to our most up-to-date information regarding any global public health situations that may arise\u2014 click here to join our free Pain Free for Life Support Group on Facebook.
