Tobacco is the second major cause of death in the world. It is currently responsible for the death of one in ten adults worldwide. Every 6 .5 seconds one tobacco user dies from a tobacco -related disease somewhere in the world . One third of the Indian population consumes some form of tobacco. This addiction is deep rooted and presents differently across the cou ntry. Evidence from GATS -2 Surve y presents 55.4% Smokers and 49.7% Smokeless tobacco users are interested or planning to quit the addiction. India has been in the forefront of tobacco control activities and played a leadership role in bringing region spec ific issues like smokeless tobac co into the fray . Government of India has made tremendous strides in tobacco control efforts by implementing various initiatives from Advocacy leading to the signing and ratification of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacc o Control (FCTC) in 2004; conduc ting the Global Youth and Adult Tobacco Surveys. The recognition of associations between tobacco use and oral health, as well as the benefits of tobacco cessation on oral health outcomes makes it imperative for national ora l health programmes to actively support tobacco control efforts at both the clinical and community levels. The National Oral Health Program (NOHP) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare , Govt. of India reinitiated its activities in 2014 and has ma de rapid developments in promoti ng oral health across the country and strengthened systems. In order to generate evidence that could be translated to policies the NOHP proposed and now is developing National Resource Centres across the country by partnerin g with imminent Dental Instituti ons who could support and translate evidence to policies. Further building resource capacities at national level is another important goal of National Resource Centres. The National Resource Centre for Oral Health & Tobacco Cessation was established by at MAIDS with support from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare , Government of India and Department of Health and Family Welfare Government of Delhi. NRC for Oral Health and Tobacco Cessation envisions being a single poi nt of contact in developing, imp lementing and advancing the scope of dental health professionals in tobacco cessation for addressing patient care, research and capacity building along with integration in dental education. The National Resource Centre has now developed this tobacco cessat ion m anual for dental professionals with the help of 18 Technical experts from various medical and dental specialties working in imminent institutions, who have provided their valuable as well as practical inputs in making t his manual relevant to Indian Co ntext. As we are aware that d ental health care providers have several roles to play in tobacco control, including preventing non -tobacco users from starting to use, assisting tobacco users in quitting, and protecting non -tobacco users from exposure to tob acco smoke. The manual focuses on equipping dental professionals with knowledge, skills and confidence for applying best evidence for tobacco cessation. Despite the evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of tob acco cessation interventions pro vided by the dental professionals, more than 50% of them, especially those in low - and middle -income countries, do not routinely deliver these interventions. The lack of knowledge and skills about tobacco and tobacco contro l is a major barrier to the provision of tobacco cessation interventions. The literature evidence has also shown that dental professionals have a desire to receive formal t raining in patient counselling. The manual is based on current empirical evidence, best practices and extensive cli nical experience. The document aims to serve as a quick reference guide to help oral health care providers deliver tobacco cessation as part of their routine practice. This guideline provides information on the various form s of cessation support from brie f intervention to the more detailed pharmacological interventions. The efforts are an attempt towards making the community tobacco free. It gives me immense pleasure in introducing the manual titl ed \"Tobacco Cessation in Dental Settings - Reference Manual for Dental Professionals \" which is developed by National Resource Centre for Oral Health and Tobacco Cessation under National Oral Health Programme at Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences, New Delhi. Convergence of sincere efforts made by multiple healthcare professionals f or tobacco cessation is really commendable. As a signatory to FCTC 2004, India is abide to develop her own guidelines to prevent develop accessible, affordable, and effectiv e cessation programs in a variety of settings such as educational institutions, hea lthcare facilities, workplaces, and sporting activities. Use of tobacco -containing products has been associated with both immediate and long-term adverse oral and systemic effects. Tobacco use lead to tobacco depend ence. It is critically important that pr evention and cessation programs should be available to help people break their tobacco addiction for good. The document will serve as a guideline and develop greater confide nce for dental professionals in imparting evidence based tobacco cessation services . On the release of this manual, I extend my good wishes and hope that manual will also be a guide for technical training of dental professionals. Tobacco use is a major public health chal lenge and requires collaboration among different healthcare professionals to address its impact holistically . The adverse effects of tobacco use on oral health are quite evident and dental professionals are in an ideal position to advice users about tobacc o cessation. Sensitization and structured training of Dental healthcare professionals in Tobacco Cessation can play a vital role in strengthening those services . Tobacco Cessation in Dental Settings - Reference Manual for Dental Professionals is intended f or providing evidence based cessation services at all the levels of healthcare. It has been developed to enhance the competence and skills in scaling up the challenging task o f tobacco cessation in dental settings , across the country . To achieve the goal of expanding tobacco cessation services in India, this manual has to be widely disseminated to reach all relevant stakeholders. I convey my best wishes to the Core Committee of the technical experts, National Resourc e Centre for Oral He alth and Tobacco Cessation at MAIDS, Delhi and N ational Oral Health Program Division for the release of the reference manual and wish them all the success i n their future endeavors . Tobacco use is the world's most significant scourage that is responsible for numerous preventable morbidity, most of which have the potential to kill its consumers prematurely. While Medical Professional deal with a variety of systemic disorders related to tobacco in virtually every fie ld, including internal medicine, surgery, and otorhinolaryngology, dental professionals find themselves in a unique position whereby, they can have an access to the ill effe cts of tobacco us at an early stage as their outreach to a large number of tobacco user with a considerable potential in terms of persuading the user to quit tobacco use (both by oral intake and smoking). The development of the Manual has followed an iterative process of drafting, review and discuss ion and is based on recent scientific evidence and best practices from around the world. I hope that the Manual will help to further strengthen tobacco cessation services through providing interventions tailored to local needs in Indian context. I congratu late National Resource Centre for Oral Health & Tobacco Cessation a nd National Oral Health Programme for developing this document and look to their implementation at all levels of healthcare across country. I wish that this manual becomes an important link in tobacco cessation. It would be in order that this manual is available in a PDF format on the mobile phones of users for ready reference as required. MESSAGE Tobacco e pidemic in India and the South E ast Asia regio n differs from other developed countries. Tobacco use in India is prevalent among 28.6% of tobacco users with higher prevalence among males (42.4%) and (14.2% ) in females. Many tobacco users are willing to quit tobacco bu t remain unsuccessful due to l ack o f professional support . Dental healthcare professionals are an integral part of the human resource in the healthcare delivery system in the country . Dental Professionals can reform the delivery of structured tobacco cess ation services to all its patients who consume tobacco. The content of the manual are evidence based, practical and designed for effective tailor made interventions for tobacco users in dental settings . I am confident that this document will be valuable for improving the quality of tobacc o cessation services and reducing the burden of tobacco use in India. I would like to acknowledge the efforts put by National Resource Centre for Oral Health and Tobacco Cessation at Maulana Azad Institute of Den tal Sciences in preparing the document. Greetings to All Tobacco Cessation is an integral part of Tobacco Control strategy . Dental Healthcare Professionals have been identif ied as key stakeholder in imparting tobacco cessation services within the practices as well as commu nities. Tobacco Cessation in dental set up should not be elective but should be available to all tobacco user s. Dental Council of India (D CI) has always env isioned Dental Institutions as potential available resource for promotion of oral health and delivering cess ation services to all. To further upscale the Tobacco Cessation Services, National Oral Health Program, MoHFW, GoI & D ental Counci l of India release d the Operational Guideline s for \"Establishment of Tobacco Cessation Center at Dental Institutions in India\" . The Dental Council has strongly recommended implementation of TCCs across Dental Institutions. The National Resource Center for Oral Health and To bacco Cessation (NRC OH -TC) is the nodal center for establishment of TCC, capacity building of dental profes sionals & Research for tobacco cessation. The structured Training Module will enable standardized capacity building of the dental professional acros s the country and effective implementation of TCC services in India. Dr. Vikrant Mohanty (Dr. Dib yendu ) Professor & Head MAIDS, New Delhi Email: vikrantmohanty@gmail.com MESSAGE Tobacco use and impact on Oral diseas es pose a major health burden in India. There is adequate evidence which confirms or suggests that tobacco u se has a causal relationship with many oral diseases and conditions including oral cancers and other mucosal lesions, periodontal diseases, dental c aries, an d premature tooth loss. Further dental treatment outcomes remain affected gravely. The current manu al augments the efforts to integrate the existing guidelines which are best su ited for dental settings. This manual has been put together with the e fforts of technical experts from various esteemed organizations with vast experience in tobacco cessation in multiple settings. This manual will serve as handy technical guide for enabli ng dental professionals to expand the tobacco cessation services. I co ngratulat e the Core Committee and Team NRC at the Institute and hope that this manual will promote structure d training of dental professionals while improving treatment outcomes across t he country. Tobacco Cessation should be universally available to all t obacco us ers.

Article 14 of WHO FCTC: Tobacco dependence and cessation Requires Parties to dev elop accessibl e, affordable, and effective cessat ion programs in a variety of settings such as educ ational institutions, healthcare facilities, workplac es, and sporting activ ities. Cessation activities include diagnosis and treatment of toba cco dependence, as well as counselling services. Tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that frequently necess itates professional intervention. Various health care profes sionals are involved in tobacco control and cessation activities world -wide. Dental settings pro vide an excellent site for providin g tobacco intervention services since 1970s. In developed countri es, more than 60% of tobacco users see their dentist or dental hygienist annually. Evidence from the Cochrane database has proven that professi onal interven tion for tobacco cessation conducte d by dental health professionals increase the odds of tobacco abs tinence rates by 1.71 (95% CI = 1.44-2.03) among toba cco use rs. Tobacco epidemic in India and South East Asia region differs from other develop ed countries. Tobacco use in India is prevalent among 28.6% of tobacco users with higher prevalence among males (42.4%) and 14.2% in females. Smokeless form of tobacc o is mo re prevalent in developing countries LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the professi onals should be able to understand the Scope of Tobacco Cessation in Dental settin gs Role of dental health professionals in tobacco cessation Approach to provide tobac co cessat ion interv ention in dental settings 1. ROLE OF DENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN TOBACCO CESSATION 1 0 2 like India. Khaini is used most commonly (11.2 %) followed by bidi (7.7%), gutka (6.8%) and b etel quid with tobacco (5.8%) Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS -2) was conducted in the year 2016 -17 and covered 30 sta tes an d 02 Union Territories of India . The nationally representative survey revealed tha t 52% of toba cco users are willing to quit tobac co. However the penetration of different methods to suppor t cessation by health professionals remains low. Most users are attempting to quit, but without any support. Most users who are attempting to quit are unsuccessful to sustain the quit status for ev en a month. A small proportion of smokers (4.1%) even make the wrong choice of switching to smokeless tobacco as an approach to quitting. Tobacco users who had been advised by a health care provider during the past 12 months has 1.11 odds of quitting tobac co compared to those who were not advised by health care p rovider . SCOPE OF TOBACCO CESSATION IN DENTAL SETTINGS Denta l professionals are in the unique position in helping tobacco users as they can reach large numbers of tobacco users and have considerab le potential in persuading them to quit. Dental patient s are particularly receptive to health messages at periodic check-ups, and oral effects of tobacco use provide visible evidence and a strong motivation fo r tobacco u sers to quit. Oral manifestations can assist customize interventions and boost their effect iveness, especially among young users in the early stages of tob acco initiation. One unique aspect of dentistry is that some of the adverse health effects of tobacc o use are clinically apparent in th e oral cavity at an even relatively early stages of use. Further dentist spend chair side time diagnosing and treating patients which can be utilized as \"Teachable Moments\" for bringing about health behaviour change effec tively. As emph asized in the World Oral Health Report 2003, there are also ethical, moral and practical reasons why oral health professionals can play an important role in helping tobacco users to quit: They are especially concerned about the adverse effects caused by tobacco use in the oral cavity. They typically have access to children, young peopl e and their caregivers, thus providing opportunities to influence individuals to quit or neve r begin usi ng tobacco. They often have more time with patients than many other health professionals, providing opportuni ties to integrate tobacco cessation interve ntions into their clinic al practice. They often treat women of childbearing age, and are thus able to explain the potential harm to babies from tobacco use. They can build their patient's interest in discontinuing tobacco use by showing actual effects of tobacco in the mouth. They are as effective as other health professionals in helping tobacco users quit. Fig. 1.1: Oral Health examination 3 In addition to h elping current users quit in clinical settings, dental healt h care professionals can play a vital role in providing comm unity -based tobacco cessation services, building capacity and creating relevant information regarding tobacco use and its ill -effects. At the community level, local dental societies and dentists can become involved in local tobacco control coalitions, whic h funct ion to mobilize and empower the community to make the changes that support non -use of tob acco. Community -based programs may inclu de activities such as educating the public on the health hazards of environmental tobacco smoke, promoting smoke -free re stauran ts, and encouraging policies and programs that support prevention and cessation of tobacc o use. APPROACHES TO PROVIDE TOBACCO CES SATION INTERVENTION BY DENTAL PROFESSIONALS Tobacco intervention must be viewed as an integral part of quality dental care. Ma ny tobacco users visit a dental office every year, so it is important that dentists b e prepar ed to provide effective and structu red interventions. Dental health professionals can as sist their patients in a number of ways using the evidence -based a pproache s in the form of brief interventions and pharmacotherapy to quit tobacco use. With re ference to the brief i ntervention, to those who are willing to quit, the five major steps (\"5 As\") in the dental care setting plays an important role. It is import ant for the dental care provider to Ask the patient if he or she uses tobacco, Advise him or her to q uit, Assess willingness to make a q uit attempt, Assist the patient in making a quit attempt and Arrange for follow -up contacts to prevent relapse. The strategies a re designed to be brief, requiring three minutes or less of direct clinician time. For those who are not r eady to make a quit attempt, may respond to a motivational intervention built around the \"5Rs\"; Relevance, Risks, Rewards, Roadblock s and Rep etition. Dental Professionals should inform about the Relevance of quitting tobacco, Risk of continui ng tobacco use, Rewards of quitting tobacco, Identify Roadblocks in quitting habit, Repetition at every visit. Pharmacotherapy for tobacco depen dence treat ment is safe and effective and significantly increases the chance for long-term tobacco abstinence compared with quit attempts unaided by pharmacotherapy. Interventions that combine pharmacotherapy and behavioral support increase tobacco cess ation success rates c ompared to single intervention. Use of lifestyle modifications by including Fig. 1.2: 5A 's (Five M ajor Steps Help Patient to Quit ) Fig. 1.3: 5R's (Five Majo r Steps: - Incre ase Motivati on to Quit) 4 yoga, e xercises, healthy sleep practices and dietary habits modifications under supervision by trained health professionals would yield better treatment outcom es CONCLUSION If all dental care providers routinely ask about tobacco use and advise tobacco users to quit, they have the potential to reach more than 80% of all tobacco users per year, trigger 40% of cases to make a quit attempt; and help 2-3% of those receiving brief advice quit successfully. Helping patients quit tobacco as a part of routine practice ta kes only th ree to five m inutes which is feasib le, effective and efficient. All dental healthcare professionals should also promote tobacco -free workplace strategies. Dental h ealth professionals can fulfill to become a role model in many ways in quitting t obacco from being an adv ocate of change, resear cher, health educator and clin ician, which will not only help individuals but also change communit y health behaviour. Do's and Don't s for Tobacco Cessation Couns elling DO'S DON'T S 1. Ask about tobacco use to every individual 2. Clear and strong advice to quit for the tobacco -user 3. Active Listen ing 4. Providing the needed guidance and support 5. Plan follow -up and educate the famil y/friends about second hand smoke and to maintain social support 1. Judge the patient o r label a person 2. Give moralistic advice 3. False assurance or promises 4. Provide incorrect information 5. Focus on the negatives Table -1.1: Tobacco Cessation Counseling for the De ntal Professionals -Do's & Don'ts PROFE SSIONAL INSI GHT Oral health professionals should routinely offer three -to-five-minute brief tobacco interventions to all tobacco users in primary care throu gh the 5 As and 5Rs models - WHO KEY TAKEAWAY One uniqu e aspec t of dent istry is that so me of the adverse health effects of tobacco use are clinical ly appa rent in the oral cavity in even relatively early stages of use. Dental pr ofession als are in the unique position in helping tobacco users as they can reach them out in large numbers and have considerable potential to pursue and motivate them to quit. 5 INTROD UCTION Tobacco use is the world's mos t significant single cause of preve ntable deaths and illness, which kills half of its consumers prematurely. According to the World Health Organization (WH O), although there is a decline in many high-income countries, the epidemic continues to ravage low- and middle -income countries. It has been estimated that between 2005 and 2030, 175 million people across the globe will die from to bacco -related disease if immedi ate steps aren't taken to curb the epidemic. The tobacco plant was a new world plant. It grew wildly (Nicotiana Rustica), but was also cultivated (Nicotiana Tabacum) by Native Americans. Tobacco cultivation in India was intro duced by the Portuguese in 1605 . Initiall y was grown in K aira and Mehsana distr icts of Gujarat and later spread to ot her areas of the country. Wild Toba cco was used by Shamans for religious, or spiritual, purposes. It naturally contains nicotine co ntent of up to 9%; this is abou t 3 to 9 t imes more nicotine than cultivated tobacco, which contains about 1% to 3% nicotine content. The leaves of c ultivated tobacco are typically processed into tobacco products (e.g., cigars, cigarettes, etc.) LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the profe ssionals will be able to understand the Different forms of tobacco products Epidemi ology of tobacco use in India 2. INTROD UCTION, EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TOBACCO USE IN INDIA AND TYPES OF TOBA CCO PRODUCTS 2 0 6 E-Cigarettes ENDS ENNDS Heated Kreteks Sticks OF TOBACCO TYPES OF TOBACCO India is a cultu rally di verse na tion with a huge variety of tobacco products available. It is the second largest consumer of tobacco globally, and accou nts for approximately one-sixth of the world's tobacco - related deaths. The tobacco problem in India is peculiar, with c onsumpti on of a variety of smokeless and smoking forms or dual use of tobacco. A brief summary of the various tobacco products available is mentioned below. Fig. 2.1: Types of Tobacco Products 7 SMOKELESS FORM OF TOBACCO Smokeless tob acco, whether of the chewing variety o r snuff, masher i cont ain several carcinogens o f which tobacco s pecific nitrosamines are the most s ignificant. The major smokeless forms of tobacco available in India are as follows: 1. PAAN Most common form dating back to more than 2000 years. Paan refers to betel leaf (from p iper betel wine). Quid (also called beeda, tambula) contains areca nut which may be used raw, baked or boiled lime obtained from lime stone or sea shells, and according to local customs may include aniseed, catec hu, cardamom, cinnamon, coconut, cloves, su gar and tobacco. 2. MAINPUR I TOBACCO Include s tobacco, slaked lime, finely cut areca nut, camphor and cloves. All this was made into a paste and smeared on betel leaf and chewed. Mainpuri name comes fro m a place in U.P near Agra, where it i s usually chewe d and famous among locals . A high prevalence of oral leukoplakia and oral cancer ha s been found in this place and among these people who regularly chew mainpuri paan. 3. MAWA Mawa is a mixture of thin shavings of areca nut with addition of slaked lime and tobacco. It is usually wrapped in cellophane paper and tied in the shape of a small b all. Commercially available in small ball form packed in a pouch. Before consumption the pouch is vigorously rubbed in the pal m to mix t he contents. Consumed in Gu jarat, Bihar and eastern India. 4. ZARDA Tobacco leaf boile d in water along with lime and spices until evaporation. The residual tobacco is then dried and colored with dyes. Zarda may be chewed by itself, with arecanut or in bete l- quid. Fig. 2.3 Mainpuri Tobac co Fig. 2.5 Zarda Fig. 2.2 : Paan Fig. 2. 4 Mawa 8 5. GUTKHA It is prepare d by crushing betel nut, tobacco and adding some sweet or savory flavor. Gutkha originated in India, but because of its sweet flavor it is taken up by western countries and widely used. 6. PAN MASALA Pan masala comes in attractive foil packets (sachets) and tins, which can be stored and carried conveniently. Carrying a pan masala tin has even beco me a status symbol, and offering pan masala is accepted as implying hospitality and equality. 7. KIWAM Kiwam is a th ick pa ste prepared from tobacco leaf extrac t, spices (e.g., saffron, cardamom, aniseed) , and additives such as musk. Kiwam is placed in the mo uth and chewed or used as an optional tobacco ingredient in betel quid. 8. RED TOOTH POWDER It is a commercia lly availabl e dentifrice tha t toothpowders (dant manjan) lack pictori al which implies that these are disguised as a dentifrice. 9. SNUFF Dry snuff is a finely powdered tobacco that is inhaled through the nose or taken by mouth. Once widely us ed now has de clined. Moist snuf f is a powdered tob acco finely ground, held bet ween cheek and gums. Other parts of moist snuff include khaini, shammahand Naas or naswa. Fig. 2.6 Guthka Fig. 2.7 Pan Masala Fig. 2.8 Kiwam Fig. 2.9 Red Tooth Pow der Fig. 2.10 Snuff 9 10. KHAINI It is powdered slaked lime paste mixture occasi This form is used wides pread in Maharashtra and several sta tes in North India like Uttar Prade sh, Bihar etc. The ingredients are vigorously mixed with thumb to make the mixture alkaline, and are placed in the premo lar region of the mandibular groove . 11. MISHRI Prepare d by roasting tobacco on a hot metal plate until it is uniformly black. It is then powdered and used with catechu. Catechu is a residual extract obtained from soaking b ark of a hard wood tree Acacia Catech u in boiling wat er. Used in Maharashtra especially by women, who cleans their teeth initially, soon apply Mishri several times. 12. GUDHAKHU Tobacco Paste powdered and mixed with molasses and other ingredients. Availab le commercially and is carried in a metal container. Appl ied to the teeth and gums with finger, predominantly by women. In Singh bhum district, Bihar, 1% of the men and 16% of the women use gudhakhu. 13. CREAMY SNUFF It is a tobacco marketed in toothpaste like tubes. This tobacco habit is pop ular among children in Goa. 14. PATTIWALA TOBACCO Sun-cured tobacco leaf used with or without lime. Fig. 2.13 Gudhakhu Fig. 2.1 4 Creamy Snuff Fig. 2.1 5 Pattiwala Tobacco Fig. 2.11 Khai ni Fig. 2.12 Mishri 10 15. BAJJ AR It is dry snuff used commonly in women in Gujarat on the teeth and gums. The materia l is carried in a small metal container, and a twig is dippe d into the snuff and used to apply. 16. GUL Gul is commercially manufactured using very fine tobacco dust. It is an oral tobacco powder which is rubbed over the gum and the teeth. 17. TAIBUR & HIDAKPHU Tuibur an d hidakphu are watery tobacco products made by passi ng tobacco sm oke through water Toba cco water is tobacco -smoke infused eater. It is a unique smokeless product that is liquid. 18. DOHRA Dohr a is a wet mixture of tobacco, slaked lime, areca nut, and other , TOBAC CO 1. BIDI Bidis consists of a small amount of tobacco, hand wrapped in dried temburni leaf and tied with string s. Bidis are widely used throughout South East Asia and mai nly in India. 34% of total production 0.2-0.3gm sun dried tobacco flakes hand rolled in temburni / tendu leaf & tied in thread. Nicotine content - 1.7 to 3mg. Tar content - 45-50mg 2. CIGARETTE Cigarettes consist of shredded or reconstituted tobacco proce ssed with hundreds of chemicals. They are the predominant form of tobacco used worldwid e,1 gram of tobacco cured in the sun or artificial heat is covered with paper. Fig. 2.1 6 Bajjar Fig. 2. 17 Gul Fig. 2.18 Dohra Fig. 2.1 9 Bidi Fig. 2. 20 Cigarette 11 Tobacco is generally treated with sugars, flavoring and aromatic ingredients 1-1.4mg of nicotine and 19-27mg tar 31% of tobacco grown in India is used for manufacture of cigaret tes 3. CHILLUM Chillum is held vertically to prevent tobacco from entering the mouth, a pebble or a stopper is introduced into the chillum. It is a straight, 10-14cm l ong conical clay pipe. Filled with coarsely cut tobacco pieces and a glowing charcoa l is kept on top of tobacco. 4. CHUTTA/CHEROOR It is a cylindrical coarsely prepared cheroot. Cured tobacco is wrapped in a dried tobacco leaf. The name is reported to be derived from a tamil word 'Shruttu ' which means 'to roll'. Most wide spread in Andhara Prades h and Tamil Nadu. It is also called 'cheroor' or 'cigar'. Cigars are made of air cured, fermented tobacco usual ly in modern factories. Cheroors are small cigars made of heavily bodied tobacco. 5. DHUMTI Somewhat conical ch eroots (ci gar with both end s open). I t is made by rolling tobacco inside the leaf of a jackfruit tree, a banana plant, or a local shrub, hansali. Dhumti smoking was practiced exclusively by the Christian community and reverse smoki ng was more common among women. 6. HOOKAH Also called wate r-pipe or hubble -bubble. Used in place with a strong Mughal culture influenc e. Purely of Indian origin, this corresponds with the introduction of tobac co in INDIA. The tobacco smoke is drawn thr ough th e water in the bas e of the hookah whi ch cools and filters the smoke. Fig. 2. 21 Chillum Fig. 2. 24 Hookah Fig. 2. 22 Cherr ot Fig. 2. 23 Dhumti 12 6. HOOKLI Short clay pipe 7-10 cm. with a mouth -piece and bowl. Sometimes, a wooden stem is used, with a detachable clay bowl, presumab ly to reduce the heat. Tobacco is placed i n the b owl, and the smoke is inhaled through the stem. Comm only used in Bhavnagar district of Gujarat . 7. KRETEKS 1. They are indigenous cheroots containing tobacco, clove and cocoa, which give the characteristic flavor and 'honey' taste to the smoke. 2. Krete k smoki ng originated in Indonesia in 1824; the word kretek appe ars to have come from the sound and sparks produced when it is inhaled. 8. STICKS These are made from sun-cured tobacco as brus and wrapped in cigar ette paper. 9. CIGARS Cigars are made up of a ir-cured and ferme nted tobaccos with a tobacco - leaf wrapper. The l ong aging and fermented process produces high concentration of carcinogenic compou nds that are released on combustion . The concentrations o f toxins and irritants in cigars are higher than i n cigarettes REV ERS E SMOKING The habit of smoki ng cigarettes or cigars in reverse fashion, i.e., keeping the b urning end inside the mouth, is reporte d from the Caribbean islands, Colom bia, Panama, Venez uela, Sardinia, the Philippines and India. In India, reverse smokin g is practiced on the east coast, particularly in Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts, Andhra Pradesh (A.P) and to a lesser extent a long the west coast in Goa. In the coastal areas of A.P, a coarsely prepared cigar called chutta is smoked in this fashion, more often by women. The temp erature of the palat al mucosa may go up to 580- degree C. Fig. 2.26 Kretek Fig. 2. 25 Hookli Fig. 2. 27 Stick Fig. 2.29 Reverse Smoking Fig. 2. 28 Cigar 13 OTHER FORMS OF TOBACCO Heated tobacco product s (HTPs) HTPs are like all other tobacco p roducts, inherently toxic and contain carci nogens. HTPs produce aerosols containing nicotine and toxic chemica ls upon heating of t he tobacco, or activation of a device containing the tobacco. They are marketed as \"Heat Not Burn\" products and avail able as iQOS, Ploom, glo and PAX vaporizers. The aer osols a re inhaled by user s during a process of sucking or smoking involving a device. They contain the highly addictive substance nicotine, non-tobacco additives and are often flavored. There is not enoug h eviden ce to suggest that they are less harmful than conv entional cigarette s and their effects of second - hand emission s produc ed by HTPs. E-cigarettes Electronic nicoti ne delivery systems (ENDS) and Electronic Non-Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENNDS), commo nly referred to as e-cigarettes, are devices whic h heat a liquid to create an aerosol which is then inhaled by the user , these may or may n ot contain nicotine. Process of using e -cigarettes is known as Vaping. The main co nstituents of the solution by volum e are propylene glycol, with or without glycerol, and fl avoring agents. All ECs have three basic components: a battery, atomizer, and fluid reservoir, which stores the e -liquid. Wi th time, E - cigarettes have evolved from basic to complex designs with the cig-a-like (first generation), clearomizer (second generatio n), mod (third generation), and Pod Mods (fourth generation) . EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TOBACCO USE IN INDIA Nationally repres entative surveys and community -based studie s have s hown the socio -economic, cultural, d emographic, religion - based correlates of tobacco con sumption. Smoking and smokeless forms of tobacco are signifi cantly higher in the rural areas, among uneducated poor p eople, and the socially disadvantaged popul ation. Global Youth Tobac co Survey, 2 019 rep orts that around 8.5% of 13- 15 years (9.6% of boys and 7.4% of girls) currently used any tobacco product, 7.3% smoked tobacco, and 4.1% respectively smokeless tobacco. As per Global Adult Tobacco Survey -2, 2016 - 17, 19.0% of men, 2.0% of women and 10.7% (99.5 million) of all adults currentl y smoke tobacco. Around 29.6% of men, 12.8% of women and 21.4% (199.4 millio n) of all adults use smokeless tobacco. Around 42.4% of men, 14.2% of women and 28.6% (266.8 millio n) of all adults use any form of tobac co (smoked and/or smokeless tobacco. Khaini (a form of SLT) and beedis are the dominant forms of tobacco consumed in In dia, at 11% and 8%, respectively. Around 55.4% of curren t smokers are planning or thinking of quitt ing smok ing and Fig: 2.31 Generations of E -cigarette Fig. 2.30 Heated Tobacc o Produc t Fig. 2.32 Forms of E-Cigarette 14 PROFESSIO NAL INSIG HT Are Heated Tobacco Products the same as Electronic Cigarettes? No, Heated Tobacco Products heat actual tobacco leaf. By contrast, E -cigaret te's heat liqu ids that typically contain nicotine derived from tobacco, as well as flavourings and other ingredien ts- Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 49.6% of current smoke less t obacco users are planning or thinking of quitting smo keless tobacco use. 48.8% of current smokers were advised by health care providers to quit smoking and 31.7% of curr ent smokeless tobacco users were advised by health care providers to quit use of smokel ess tobacco. CONCLUSION Tobacco -use in India is clea rly a big burden in terms of its magnitude and use in differ ent forms. All forms of tobacco are addictive in natur e due to the presence of nicotine. Dual users are at much higher health risks than t hose who consume the individual tobacco pr oduct. Also, for achieving a higher quit rate, they require longer follow -up. The tobacco control programs need more targeted inte rventions for specific groups in the popula tion. The tobacco users s hould be stron gly encouraged to quit tobacco to eliminate long-term detrim ental effects on their health. KEY TAKE AWAY The tobacco pr oblem in India is peculiar, wit h consumption of a variety of smokeless and smoking forms. In India tobacco is mainly used either in smok ing form like cigarette, beedi, hookah, an d other pipes li ke chillum, chutta, dhumti, cherrot and cigar or in tobacco products a nd E- cigarettes (Vaping) are the newer fo rms of tobacco products used nowadays. According to WHO, people in the region of South East Asia use both smoking and smokeless forms of tobacco. India, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Thailand - are among the top 20 tob acco-producing countries in the world. Ind ia is next to Ch ina in both tobacco production and consumption in the world. Reverse smoking is common in coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh; coarsely prepared cigar called chutta are smoked commonly, more often by wo men. 42.4% of men, 14.2% of women and 28. 6% (266.8 million ) of all adults currently use tobacco (smoked and/or smokeless tobacco) Only 21.5% smok ers and 19.5% users of smokeless tobacco are planning/thin king to qu it in next 12 mont hs; the rest have either decided quit sometime in future but not i n next 12 months or stayed undecided. 15 ASSESSMENT Tick the correct answer: 1.

Toba cco threatens healt h, economic s, and social development. According to the World Heal th Organization (WHO) estim ates, globally, there were 100 million premature deaths due to tobac co in the 20th century, and if the current trends of tobacco use continue, this number is expect ed to rise to 1 billion in the 21st century. Fig 3.1: Interrelationship between tobacco and other risk factor and NCD (Source: Handbook for counsellors : Reducing Risk Factors for Non -Commu nicable Dise ase) LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the prof essionals should be able to understand th e Health, economic and social impact of tob acco use Health, economi c and social benefits of quitting tobacco Various screening techniques for Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders Role of dental health profes sionals in tobacco cessation Approach to provide tobac co cessat ion interv ention in dental settings 3. IMPACT OF TOBACCO ON HEALTH AND ORAL HEALTH 3 0 18 Tobac co use is an important mod ifiable risk fac tor common to major non -communicable diseases (NCDs) -cancer , cardiov ascular diseases, c hronic respiratory diseases and diabetes, causing 1 in 6 of all NCD deaths (Figure 3.1). Toba cco is a risk factor for six of th e eight leading causes of d eath in the world (Figure 3.2) Tobacco kills and disables more people than any other disease-causing age nts. Fig 3.2: Tobacco is a risk factor for six of eight leading causes of death in the world (Source : WHO Brief Intervent ion for Tobacco Cessation , 2014 ) Toba cco-use is currently recognized as a major preventable factor fo r developing and aggravating CVDs a long wi th raised body lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, poor nutrition and excessive alcohol consumption. S mokers have a two to threefold greater risk of suffering sudden cardiac deat h than non -smokers, the risk i ncreasing with increased exposure to cigarette smoke. Fig. 3.3: Adverse Effects Associated With Tobac co-Use 19 I. HEALTH IMPACT OF TOBACCO -USE The professional must be familiar with the health ris ks of toba cco use to be able to relate smokin g to your patient's condition. Many smokers, especially those in developing countries, do not completely understand the dangers of tobacc o smoking du e to tobacco companies' misleading information that dist ort th e true facts about smoking. Tobacco products are made of extremely toxic materials . Tobacco smoke contains more than 7000 chemicals, of which at least 250 are known to be harmful and at least 69 are known to cause cancer. Nicotine is classified as a Class Ib toxin. There is no safe limit for tobacco use, and even for second -hand smoke exposure. Tobacco causes immediate damage to the body, causing many acute medical conditions such as shortness of breath, exacerbation of asthma and respiratory infecti ons, as well as many chronic disea ses including heart disease, strokes, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. A. Health Conditions Caused Due To Tobacco Use 1. Lung cancer: Smokers are t en times more like ly to die from lung cancer than non -smokers, and heavy smok ers are 15 to 25 times more at risk than non -smokers. Thus, the duration and intensity of smoking can influence the risk of developin g lung cancer. Adverse Effects of Tobacco Use Lung cancer Laryngeal cancer Oropharyngeal c ancers Oesophag eal cance r Stomach Pancreati c cancer Urinary tract c ancers Peripheral vascular disease Respiratory Disease Diabetes General ill health Premature aging Sexual dysfunct ion and impaired fertility Tuberculosis Table 3.1 : Healt h Condition due to Tobacc o Use Fig. 3.4: Conten t of Cigare tte 20 2. Laryngeal cancer: Heavy smokers have up to 20 times the risk of devel oping laryn geal Cancers comp ared with non -smokers. The ri sk of developing cancer increases with th e duration of smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked. 3. Oropharyngeal cancers: The average risk fo r developing an oral or pharyngeal cancer is 10 times higher among male smokers and f ive times higher among female smokers than lifetime non- smokers. Oral and pharyngeal tissues come into direct contact with carci nogens present in smoke less tobacco product s and tobacco smoke. 4. Oesophageal cancer: Smokers have up to seven or eight times the risk of developing esophageal cancer than non -smokers. Use of alcohol with tobacco increases the risk of this cancer manifold. 5. Stomach cancer: Smoking may also be related to the development of cancers in ot her sites within the stomach (\"non-cardia gastric cancers\"), possibly by intera ction with the helicobacter pylori infect ion. 6. Pancreatic cancer: Heavy smokers have three to five t imes the risk of develo ping pancreatic cancer than non -smokers. Cancers of the pancreas mos t commonl y arise in the cells that li ne the pancreatic ductules. 7. Urinary tract cancers: Heavy smoking (more than 40 cigarettes a day) doubles the risk of developing kidney and bladder canc ers. 8. Peripheral vasc ular disease: Smoking can both dire ctly cause ch ronic hea rt failure as well as contr ibute to other factors leadin g to it. Lower tar and nicotine cigarettes have not been shown to reduce the incidence of CHD, and t hey do not provide a l ower risk alternative for smokers who cannot or do not w ish to quit. 9. Respirat ory Diseas e: Smoking contrib utes tory illnesses including bronchitis, bronc hiolitis, influenza and pneumonia in individuals who do not already have smoking -related lung disease . It is also associated with chroni c respirator y disease s includin g symptoms such as phlegm production, cough and wheezing, and reduced lung capacity. The Mechanism of Action: Tobacco fumes: Impair ciliary activit y hyper secretion of mucus. Have deleter ious effects on immune cell function. 10. Diab etes: A major review and meta -analysis of published data h as found that curr ent smokers are more like ly to develop Type -2 diabetes than ex-smoke rs and ne ver-smoker s, and that smoker s of 20 or more cigarettes a day are at greater risk than less frequent smo kers. Overall, current smokers are estimated to have a 44% greater risk, and ex-smokers a 23% greater risk of developing Type -2 diabetes than people who have never smoked. Effects on insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and the risk for diabetes from smo keless tobacco use are plausible. 21 The Mechanism of Action: Smoking increases insulin resistance, alt ers insulin secretion . Smoking impairs pancreatic function. 11. General ill health: Smokers also report higher levels of tiredness or fatigue, reduced well-being and satisfaction with life, slightl y lower self -reported measures of mental well -being, and increa sed incidence of psychological symptoms such as depressed mood and anxiety. Smokers are also more likely to experience sleep disturbances, including taking longer to fall asleep, being less lik ely to stay asle ep, and having less total sleep time than non -smokers. Frequency of snoring increases with the amount of tobacco smoked. Chemicals in tobac co smoke produce hyposmia, duodenal reflux and altered producti on of gastric secretions. 12. Premature ag ing: It is postu lated that smoke affects the skin fibroblasts ( cells present in conn ective tissue that form collagen and elastin), thereby accelerating the appearance of aging. Increased wrinkling of the skin and alter ed complexion have been attributed to smoking, as have elastosis and, in men, telangiectasia in women . 13. Sexual dysfunction and impair ed fertility: The use of smo keless tobacco causes reproductiv e and developmental toxicity, and its use during pregnancy incr eases the risks for preeclampsia and premature birth, causes increased placental weight and reduces mean birth weight. Smokeless tobacco use by men causes reduc ed semen volume, reduced sperm co unt, reduced sperm motility and an increased frequency of abnor mal spermatozoa . 14. Tuberculosis: Most of the cases of tuberculosis in the world are to be found in the South-East Asian re gion. This regio n accounts for 50 lakh tuberculosis cases and 5 lakh deaths from Tuberculosis each year. A causal association has been f ound between acti ve and passive tobacco smoking and a range of TB outcomes including infection, devel opment of disease, treatment outcom es, relapse as well as mortality. Current smoking is associated with a doubled risk of developing tuberculosis. TB is ab out 3 times more common among eve r smokers than among never smokers and mortality due to TB is 3 -4 times greate r among s mokers than non - smokers. Mechanism of Action: Damag e to pulmonary mucosa by tobacco smoke makes it more susceptible to infection. Accom panying weight loss and malnutrit ion in smokers. 22 B. Oral Health Conditions Due To Tobacco -Use Tobacco use, includ ing tobacco smoking and smok eless tobacco use, causes a wide spectrum of diseases including oral diseases. The oral conditions include: Oral Health Conditions Due to Tobacco -Use Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders Dental Caries Pre leukopl Change in taste Central papillary atrophy of the tongue Premature tooth loss Oral Candidiasis Smoker's lip Oral Cancer Oral melanosis Oral Potentially Malignant D isorders Oral cancer Table 3.2: Oral Health Conditions due to Tobacco Use and Oral Potentially Malignant Diso rders Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders 1. Pre leukoplakia Initially a \"low -grade\" or mild reaction of the oral mucosa, appearing as a grey or greyish white lesion. It has a slight lobular pattern and an indistinct border blending int o the a djacent muco sa. It lacks the clear -cut margins, elevation and whiteness t hat is characteristic of leukoplakia. About 7% to 15% progress to leukoplakias. 2. Leukoplakia Leukop lakia (white patch) is defined as a raised white patch of the oral mucosa measuring 5 mm or more, which cannot be scrap ed of f or be attributed to any other diagnosable disease. It is the most common precancerous lesion, and it occurs six t imes more commonl y amon g smokers than non - smokers. One subtype of leukoplakia (nodular leukoplakia) has a great risk of progressing to malignancy (20% -46% progress to can cer). Fig. 3.6 Leukoplakia * Fig. 3.5 Pre -Leukoplakia * *Courtesy: Dr. Priya Kumar, Professor, Dept. of Oral Pathology & Microbio logy, MAIDS 23 Fig. 3.7 Erythropla kia* 3. Erythroplakia It is a bright red velvety plaque which cannot be characterize d clinically or pathologically as due to any other condition. In India, its prevalenc e is 0.2% to 5.2 % and the rate of malignant transfo rmation is higher than leukoplakia. 4. Oral submucous fibrosis or OSMF It is a condition characterized by sl owly progres sive chronic fibrotic disease of the oral cavity and oropharynx in w hich the oral mucosa loses its elasticity and develops fibrous bands, which ultimately lead to d ifficulty in opening the mouth. While OSMF is attributed to areca nut chewing an d is most c ommon ly seen in old people, it has shown a recent dramatic increase among the young in I ndia attributed to gutkha and paan masala chewing. Upto 5%-7% of OSMF cases progress to becoming oral cancer. 5. Tobacco quid keratosis In its mildest form, the lesion may just be noted as wrinkles at the site of application. Among t he high consumption w hite an d leathery lesions might develop, w hich s ometimes contain ulcerations. It may be easily scraped off. 6. Smoker's palate The development of a smoker's palate is perhaps the m ost common reaction of the palate to all forms of smo king. It consists of a diffuse white palate w ith numerous excrescen ces ha ving central red dots, correspond ing to the orifices of the minor salivary glands. It may begin as a grayish disco loration. 7. Palata l erythema This lesion consists of diffuse erythem a on the hard palate that occasion ally extends upto the soft palate. It is mainly observed in bidi smokers a nd chewers. 8. Central papillary atrophy of the tongue This consists of a well-defin ed oval, pink area in the center of the dorsum of the tongue, which is devoid of l ingual papillae. A similar lesion (erythematous candid iasis) may also be seen among persons with HIV infection and must be ruled out. This is again most commonly seen in bidi smokers.

Oral Candidiasis The habit of tobacco has been recognized as an impo rtant predisposing fa ctor for Oral Candidiasis because i t provo kes increased keratinization in o ral epithelium, in addition, the smoke constituents increase fungal vir ulence. 10. Oral Cancer India has one of the highest rates of oral cancer in the wo rld, with over 50% attributabl e to smokeless tobacco use mainly c hewing of betel-quid with tobacco. Accor ding to the WHO, cancer has been growing at a rate of 11 perce nt annually in Ind ia due to widespr ead tobacco consumption. Tobacco affects cancer produc tion through its effect on metabolism and en zyme activity. Many o f the m etabolites in tobacco smoke have mutagenic activity and alter the DNA of cells lining the org ans and structures w ith which it come s in contact. Over time the al tered cells replicate themselves leading to tumor form ation. II. ECONOM IC IMPACT OF TOBACCO USE Tobacc o smoking takes away not just the smoker's health but wealth. It is estimated that 5 -15% of a smoker's dispos able income is sp ent on tobacco, which could be an enormous econom ic burden on them and their family . Tobacco a nd poverty - a vicious cyc le: There i s an inextricable relationshi p between tobacco and poverty. Tobacco has social disadv antages, people who are strained financia lly are more likely to consume tobacco and makin g them poorer thus they are neglecte d in socie ty leading to loss of income, produc tivity and death. The cost calculator below can be used to help patients find out how much money they have spent on cigarettes . *Courtesy: Dr. Priya Kumar, Professor, Dept. of Oral Pathology & Microbiolo gy, MAIDS Fig. 3.14 Vicious Cycle of Smoking & Disadvantages Fig. 3.1 2 Oral Candidiasis * Fig. 3.1 3 Oral Cancer 25 Calculation Example (INR) No. of cigarettes (packs) you smoked per day N 20 (1 pack) Mon ey spent on tobacco per day N x Pack price (Rf. 40) 1 X 40 Mone y spent on tobacco per month X 30 1,200 Money spent on tobacco per year X 12 14,400 Amount spent in 10 years X 10 144,00 Amount spent in your lifetime (e.g. 17 years) Per year X 17 years 244,800 Alternatively, the follo wing calculation tables can also be used: The smoke cost calculator (2) Number of Packs you smoke a year X Number of years you have smoke X The average cigarette pack price = How much you have spent on cigarette during your lifetime X X = *For days to years conve rsion, see below tables 1 pack a day 1 \u00bd packs a day 2 packs a day 2\u00bd pack a day 3 pack a day 365 pack a year 548 pack a year 730 pack s a year 913 pack a year 1095 pack a year Table 3 .3: Smokin g Cost Calculator III. SOCIAL CONSEQUEN CES OF TOBACCO USE It is importan t to understand the social context of tobacco use to develop intervention promoting its cessa tion. Community survey and interven tion in India have shown that tobacco use is often learnt f rom parents, other older, an d peers. 26 Studies at work places and in educational institutions have reported similar findings. IV. HEALTH RISKS TO THE FAMILY Passive sm oking or Second Hand Smoke (SHS) is the inhalation of tobacco smoke or e nvironmental tobacco smoke by persons other than the intend ed \"active\" tobacco user. It occurs when tobacco smoke enters an environment, causing its inhalation by people within that environment . Smoking tobacco puts families of tobacco users at risk. Second Hand Smoke (SHS) is the smoke exhaled by a smoke r (Mains tream smok e) or smoke emanating from the burning end of cigarette / bidi/cigar etc. (Side stream smoke). Side stream smoke is known to contribute to 80% of smoke in SHS. Second hand smoke costs d early to India -8.1% o f the total healthcare cost and 0.33% of the GDP o f India. Moreo ver, as the awareness regarding harmful effects of second -hand smoke on health is low, the exposure remains high in the absence of any attempts to remain away or even ask the smokers not to smoke, when others are around them. Smoking puts the smoker's fami ly at risk. Second Hand Smoke exposure increases the risks of having the following diseases. Diseases in Children Diseases in Adults Sudden infant death syndrome Acute respi ratory illnesses Middle ear disease Chronic respiratory symptoms Early childhood caries Gingival pigmentation Coronary heart disease Nasal irritation Lung cancer Repr oductive effects in women (low birth weight and clef t lip and palate ) Periodontal disease Table: 3.4- Diseas es and adverse effects cause d by second hand smoke Dental health professionals should promote smoke -free policies, particularly where dental services are delivered in clinical settings or community -based programs so that patients will not be exposed to secondhand smoke in the health facilit ies. By having a smoke free facility, they can encourage their patients to live in a smoke free home and work in a smoke free workplace, which will help them avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. Third hand tobacco smoke / Residual tobacco smoke/ Aged tobac co smoke It is the tobacco sm oke contamination that remains after Fig. 3.15 Second H and Smoking Fig: 3. 16 Third Hand Sm oking 27 the bidi/cigarette has been extinguished. The residue from tobac co smoke that clings to virtually a ll surfaces long after a bidi/cig arette has extinguish ed could prove to be a poten tial health hazard. The biggest risk i s to young children. Dermal uptake of nicotine through a child's skin is likely to occur when a smok er returns and if nitrous oxide is in the air, which it usually is, then TSA's (Tobacco specific Nitrosamines) will be formed . TSAs are known to be some of the most potent carcinogens. IV. SCREENING METHODS Most Conventional method for examining oral mucosal lesions is visual examination. Visua l inspection of the oral cavity is a simple, acceptabl e, and accurate scree ning test for oral neoplasia . The sensitivity of oral visual inspection to detect lesions varied from 57\u00b77% -61\u00b74% and the specificity ranged from 98\u00b76 to 98\u00b78%. Oral visual screenin g has the potential to pr event at least 37 000 deaths from oral cancer worl dwide e very year. Biopsy remains the gold sta ndard for diagnosis of oral cancer . But the disadvantage of biopsy is th at it is painful, time consum ing, technique sensitive and invasi ve. Many effective diagno stic tools have been develope d with advances in or al canc er resea rch. Some of them have been discussed below. A. Toluidine blue (TB) is a member of the thiazine group of metachromatic dyes, which binds to DNA and is partially soluble both in water and in alcohol. Theoretically, dysplasti c and malignant cells have higher nucleic acid content than normal , and thus, staining of suspicious lesions with this dye can aid recogni tion of mucosal changes. Tolu idine Blue has been used as a vital stain to highlight poten tially malignant oral lesions since the early 1980 s. A po sitive s taining of toluidine blue may appear as a dark royal blue. The Toluidine blue test appears to be highl y sensitive (97.8% - 93.5%) but less specific (92.9% -73.3%), main ly because of high false positive results. Steps of toluidine blue stain applicati on for d etection of oral cancer and oral premalignant lesions. Method of Application 1. The patient is asked to rinse for 20 seconds with 1% acetic acid to clean the area follow ed by plain water for an other 20 seconds. 2. Then 1% aque ous toluidine blue solution is rinse d for 60 seconds followed by 1% acetic acid for another 20 seconds and finally rinsed with water for 20 seconds. 3. Lesions that exhib ited dark blue (or) stippled staini ng were considered as a \"positive\" test. Those that stained faintly (or) not at all were considered as \"negative\" test. B. Chemiluminescence is another method to detect earl y stages of oral cancer. Chemilumine scence for use in oral cavity is available in the mar ket by the names of Vizilite, Vizilite Plus and Fig. 3.17: White lesion on the Tongue * Fig. 3.18: Blue stained lesion after toluidine blue rinse show ing dysplastic changes * . 28 MicroLux DL. While the Vizilite Plus uses a disposable chemiluminescent light packet, the MicroLux unit offers a reusab le, battery powered light source. Th e ViziLite\u00ae (Zila Pharmaceutical s, Phoenix, AZ) was approved as adjunc tive technolo gy by U.S. Food and Drug Adm inistrat ion (FDA) in November 2001. The devi ce emits light in the wavelengths of 430 nm, 530nm and 580 nm . T his improves the visual examination procedure. C. Autofluorescence is another method of scr eening of oral muc osal lesions . Normal oral mucosa appears pale green due to the tissue autofluorescenc e resulting from stimulation with intense blue light excitation at 400-460 nm wavelengths. Due to dysplasia, there are changes in absorption and scatteri ng of light. The m ucosa with d ysplastic changes wi th this procedur e appears dark. Velscope is the marke ted product. D. Magnivisualizer gives a complete white light spect rum (equivalent to daylight 5500 -6000 A\u00b0) and provides magnification with interchangeable lenses, from 1 to 5 dioptre. This instrument not only improved th e detection rate of lesions having a p otential for progression and most of the early cancerous lesion s of the oral cavity. VI. BENEFITS OF QUIT TING TOBACCO A. HEALTH BENE FITS Helpin g your pat ients quit is the best th ing the pr ofessional can do to improve their h ealth. There are immediate and long -term health benefits of quitting for all smokers. The profes sional can extend the patient's life up to 1 0 years by quitting. It is importan t to help your patients quit smokin g as soon as possible so they can achieve these beneficial health changes and can liv e a longer and healthier life. Health risks Cessatio n benefits Oral Cancer Smoking is a leading cause of oral cance r. Smokers are 5 -10 times more likely to develop or al cancer than non-smokers. In South Asia, smokeless tobacco user are 5 times more likely to develop oral cancer 5 years after quitting smoking, the risk of developing oral cancer is cut in half. Leukopla kia Smoki ng and smokeless tobacco conditi on white patches form on the gums and other areas in the mouth. Quitting smoking and smokeless tobacco can reduce the risk of developing leukoplakia lesions. 29 Periodontal disease Smokers are 2-4 times more likely to have periodontit is destru ctive inflammatory disease of periodont al tissue. After treatment for periodontal disease, smoker do not heal as well as nonsmokers Quitt ing smoking reduces the risk of periodontal disease over time and impr ove the treatment outcome. Tooth loss Smok ers are 2 times more likely to lose too th. Accumulation of tooth, if left untreated, may impair quality of later life. Quitting smoking reduces the risk of tooth loss over time. Table 3.5: Benefits of Quitt ing T obacco Fig. 3.19 : Immediate and Long Term Benefits of Quitting 30 Benefits in comparison with those who continued: At about 30: gain almost 10 years of life expectancy . At about 40: gain 9 years of life expectancy. At about 50: gain 6 years of life expectancy . At about 60: gain 3 years of life expectancy. After the onset of life-threatening disease: rap id benefit, people who quit smoking after having a heart attack redu ce their chances of having another heart attack by 50%. B. ECONOMIC BEN EFITS Quitting also has very clear and tangible financial benefits to smokers. You can use the quit & save exercise to help patients understand how much money they can save if they quit . Quite & Save How much money can you save if your quite ?

Table 3.6: Quit & Save! Smoking cost calculator (Sou rce: Tool Ki t for Oral Health Professionals to Deliver Brief Tobacco Intervent ions) 31 C. SOCIAL BENEFITS After quitti ng, patients will feel less isolated - quitting means they can go anywh ere, not just where they can smoke. They will improve their relationship s with their family, friends and employers. They will be more productive - they don't have to keep stoppin g what they are doing to have a smoke. They will be able to expand and improve the quality of their social interact ions (contrary to their beliefs, as they become more social ly acceptable). Many patients also find their mental health improved after quittin g. They find themselves less stress ed than when they smok ed, an d no longer fee l bad about harming or being a nuisan ce to others. When patients quit smoking, their children become less likely to start smok ing and more likely to quit if they al ready smoke. It is us eful t o emphasize to smokers who are parents or gr andpar ents that \"Stop ping smoking may be one of the most i mportant things you can do for your children (or grandchild ren) by being a healthy role m odel\". CONCLUSION Oral Cancer is a bi g public health probl em wit h high prevalence in S outh East Asian countr ies. Effective primar y and secondary prevention strategies are critical in delivering the Wor ld Health Organization's (WHO) resolution that oral ca ncer should be an integral part of nat ional cancer. Tobacco use i s known as a major ris k factor for oral and many o ther cancers. A ll tobacco products, including cigare ttes, cigars, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, and snuff, contain the following: poisonous substances (toxins), cancer -causing agents (carcinoge ns) and Nico tine, an addictive sub stance. 32 KEY -TAKEAW AYS Tobacco use, in cluding tobacco smoking and smokeless tobacco use, causes a wide spectrum of diseases and oral co nditions like Dental caries, t ooth discoloration, ate etc. Tobacco's ha rmful effects are cause d by its 69 known ca rcinogens. Smokeless tobacco contains over 2000 chemicals, five of which have been directly related to causing cancer. Chewing tobacco causes precancerous lesions and conditions like leukoplak ia, erythroplakia, oral sub mucous fibrosis and o ther oral healt h conditions. Tobacco use increases th e risk of second -hand smoke to fami ly and also third hand smoking, especially to young ch ildren. Various screening methods to d etect oral lesions include toluidine blue, chemi luminescence, auto fluoresce nce, and magniv isualizer. The various health benefits of quitting include rapid and long -term benefits , and econ omic and social benefits. When patients quit their tobacco habit, th ey feel more energ ized, hea lthy, increase in appetite and a better way of living. Quitting tobacco is a win -win situation for all concerned, engaged and participati ng stakeholders - Patient s, Dentists (Health workers), Dental (Health) Institutes, State Medi cal Health Departm ent and M inistry of Health and India.\" 33 ASSESSMENT 1.

It is also linked to a detrimental impact on oral health, such as increasi ng risk of periodontal diseases. In addition, dental implant failure is more common among smokers than among non -smokers, and peri -impla ntitis among smoke rs is also more prevalent. Tobac co use contributes to increased tooth mobility and tooth loss occurs. Tooth loss reduces the oral chewing function and quality of life and leads to the subsequent demand for tooth replacement, such as dentu res or implant supported prostheses. Dental treatm ent outcomes may be unpredictable for patients who continue to smoke. The financial burden may be increas ed when a m ore intensive treatment plan is requi red to achieve oral health. Adverse Effects of Tobacc o on Oral Health Increased pl aque accumulation, hi gher in cidence of gingivitis and periodontitis, higher rate of tooth loss, and increased resorption of the alveolar ridge have been found in the oral cavity of tobacco users. Tobacco has adverse effects on oral as well as ge neral healt h of an individual an d it negatively affects the outcome of almost all therapeutic procedur es performed in the oral cavity in the followi ng ways: Dry Socket Implant Failure Delayed Wound healing Non-surgical treatment of gingiv al bleeding Surgic al and non-surgical periodontal therapy Staining and Fracture of Restorations Effect on Distraction osteogenesis Dental pain Progression of oral manifestations of diabetes LEARNING OBJECTIVE S At the end of this chapter, the profess ionals should be able to understand the Impact to tobacco use on de ntal treatment outcome 4. IMPACT OF TOBACCO ON DENTAL TREATMENT OUTCOMES 4 0 36 TOBACCO AND DENTAL TREATMENT OUTCOMES 1. Effect on a Surgical Wound The negative impact of smokin g on the healing sur gical wo und may be related to the deleterious cellular effects of nicoti ne on fibroblasts and polymorphonuc lear leuko cytes. destructive nicotine, has been de tected in the bloodstre am and in the gingiv al crevicu lar fluid. Smoking m ay also cause vasoconstriction of the gingival blood vessels, diminishin g the healing response. Tobacco sm oking redu ces the short -term oxidation -reduction potential of dental plaque, which can enhance the proportion of anaero bic bacter ia. This data makes it evide nt that cigarette smoking adversely affects the clinical outcome of intra-bony defects treated with grafts. Cigarette smoking has long been suspec ted to adversely affect woun d healing. Tobacco affe cts postoperative wound healin g following surgical and non-surgical tooth extractions, routine maxillofacial surgeries, im plants and periodontal therapies. S moking to bacco is also associated with catechola mine release resulting in vasoconstriction and decreased tissue perfusi on. Smokin g is believed to sup press the innate and host -immune responses, affecting the function of ne utrophils, the prime line of defens e against infection. Thus, the association betwe en smoking and delayed heali ng of oral tissues f ollowing surgeries i s evident. 2. Effect On Dental Implants Implant failure rate was higher among smokers, 5.6%, compared to non smokers, 3.5%, p < 0.001. Ther e is a tendency to higher failure rate with the increasing number of cigaret tes per day, 4.3% among smokers of 1-10 cigarettes a day and up to 9.2% among those who smoked 31-40 cigarettes a day, p = 0.059. A significant correlation was found between the i mplant failure rate and the following variables: smoking years, exposure to passive smoking in non-smokers, smoking status and to the number of pack years. Influence of Smoking on Early Implant Survival Early failure rate s, prior to loading, were evaluated by va rious studies, who reported early implant failure was high (6.5% - 31%) in smokers versus (1%-9%) in non -smokers . Effect of smoking on outcomes following immediate Implant placement and delayed implant placement wa s also studied and found that more compli cations were reported in smokers than non - smokers, regardless of the time of implant placement. Smokers have a higher risk of occurrence of Peri-implantitis compared to non -smokers. Studies reporting on the occurre nce of peri -implantitis had a follo w-up ranging from 1 to 14 years. Studies reporti ng marginal supporting b one loss reported a sta tistically significantly greater risk of bone loss over time in patients who smoked when compared to non -smokers. Studies repo rting on marginal bone loss had a f ollow -up time ranging from 1 to 24 years. Tobacc o smoking is a significa nt risk factor for impl ant placement and may lead to failure of implant o sseo-integration. *Picture Courtesy : Dr. Kamal, Senior Resident, Dept. of Pe riodontics & Implantology, MAIDS Fig. 4.1 Implant Failure 37 3. Smoking And Wound Healing Smokers have a higher incidence of infectious and non -infectious healing complications after s urgery compared wit h non -smokers across all s urgical specialties. Fo rmer smokers appear to have a lifetime higher risk of hea ling complic ations compared with patients who never smoked. Smoking cessation for at least 4 weeks before surgery reduces surgical site infections, but not other healing compli cations. Patients shoul d be encouraged to stop smokin g at least 4 weeks b efore s urgery to re duce the risk of surgical site infections. Across cohort studies, necrosis was 4 times more freque nt in smokers than no n-smokers, whereas surgical site infection, dehiscence, healing delay, and lack of fistula and bone healing occurred 2 times more frequen tly in smokers. The following pathophysiological mechanisms for defective healing in smokers appea r to be involved: (1) an acute detrimen tal vasoactive effect of s moking leads to postoper ative necrosis in tissues with fragile blood suppl y, such as reconst ructive tissue f laps and resp onse and impairment of oxidative bacter ial killing mechanisms lea d to surgical site infect ion. (3) delay of the prolife rative healing respo nse and alterati on of collagen metabolism lead to dehiscence and lack of fistula or bone healing. 4. Effect on non-surgical treatment of gingival bleeding The reduction in gingival b leedi ng is significantly l ess pronounced in smokers even after mechanical removal of plaque. The reasons for such a reduced improvement of gingival inflammation after plaque removal in smoker s are not known. Howe ver, since gingiva l bleeding primarily refle cts the vascular reaction s of gingival inflammation, th e suppression of ble eding m ay be attr ibutable to the vascular effects of cigarette smoking. Smoking is known to produce peripheral cut aneous vasoconstricti on. Nicotine has been shown to possess a powerful constrictive effect on gingival vessels, which might be responsible fo r the less eviden t reduction of gingival bleeding. Besides a systemic effect, there might in addition be a direct local influence of smoking on the gingiv al vasculature. Thus, findings suggest that the heal ing response to non -surgical t reatment in terms of gingiv al bleedin g might be suppressed under the influence of smoking. 5. Effects on surgical and non -surgical periodontal therapy Smokers respond less favorably than non-smokers to perio dontal therapy. Patie nts with moderate to advanced periodontitis were treated according to a split-mouth design involving the following treatment modalities: coronal scaling, root planning, modified Widman surgery, and flap with osseous resectional surgery . Data collection of various clinical parameters was done and data analysis demonstrated that smokers exhibited significantly less reduction of probing depth and less gain of probing attachment level when compared to non-smokers immediately follow ing active therapy and durin g each of the 6 years of maint enance (p < 0.05). A greate r loss of horizontal attachment level was evident 38 in smokers at each yearly exam during maintenance therap y (p<0.05). In general, these findings were true for the outcomes follow ing all 4 modalities of therapy and were most prono unced in the deepest probin g depth category (7 mm). The results also concluded a tendency for smokers to have slightly more supra -gingival plaque and bleedin g on probing. 6. EFFECT ON DENTAL RESTORAT IONS: Long term clinical suc cess of dental restorations de pends on various fac tors, including the physical properties of the material ,clinical proficiency of the treating dentist, and proper main tenance and patient c are. Understandi ng whether there is a ch ange in surface roughness is important because \"irregulari ties in surface texture enhance bacteri al adhesion, and roughened materials may suffer from increased staining.\" Increased bacterial adhe sion increases the in cidence of recur rent decay and defective restor ations. A study asse ssing the effect of smokeless tobacco on the surfa ce roughness of den tal restorations showed a significant change in color and clinical roughness existing in all r estorations when viewed clinically. The t hree restorative materia ls stud ied were amalgam, com posite and resin -modified GIC. This study only takes into account the effect a smokeless tobacco mix has on the surface roughness of dental restorations solely fro m a chemical perspective. Although the av erage pH of tobacco is m ore neutral to basic, the la rge amount of sugar, preservat ives, and chemical c arcinog ens of smoke less tobacco have an association with restoration wear. Objectively, smokeless tobacco use has more than just a chemica l effect. The la rgest effect is abrasive in nat ure. The natural stat e of the tobacco is a grainine ss, which contribute s to th e abrasive effects. Recent study done in 2019, has concluded that red wine and Cigarette Smoking cause signifi cant tooth discolorat ion and color mi smatch in enamel and re sin rest orations that are not reversible by whitening treatments. 7. Effect on distraction osteogenes is Nicotine is the main chemical component in tobacco products and its effect on bone heali ng re mains controversial. Distraction oste ogenesis is an endogeno us tissu e engineering techniq ue which provides an excellent platform to study b one healing and rege neration. In an animal -based experimental study, 60-day time release nicotine pellets or pla cebo pellets were implanted in the neck su bcutaneous tissue of the rabbi ts one week before osteotomy was performed. Then a fter distraction ost eogene sis, the animals were sacrificed and subjected to examinations by radiography, micro -computed tomography and hi stological analysis. The significantly lower bone volume and appeara nce of chondrocytes i n the nicotine group indicated that t he bone regen eration of distraction osteogenesis was compromised by nicotine exposure. Fig. 4.2 Dental Pain 39 8. Effect on root coverage procedures Heavy smoking is correlated to failure in ob taining root coverage . Smokers have small root cove rage which is associated with bad vas cularity of p eriod ontal tissues. Th e mechanism by which smoking affects periodontal plastic surgery outcomes remains unclear , but smoking interferes with several physio logical mechanisms an d cellula r functions. The larg e number of tobacco toxins may impair periodontal heali ng. Smoking also decreases periodontal blood flow, compromising graft vascularization and sub epithelial connec tivity issue graft (SCTG ) outcomes. 9. Smoking can cause patients to experience increased pain Wound healing can be achy for any one, but pain gets exacerbated in p atients with smoking habits. The American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society noted th at ci garette -related chemicals have b een shown to negatively impa ct the w ay bodies understand \"pain signals.\" Smoking can also aggravate inflamm ation , which can boost pain and add to the difficulties of the healing process. Since tobacco dependence and c hronic pain represent two highly preva lent conditi ons that indepe ndently generate substantial challenges within the domains of psychology, m edicine, public health, and economi cs, not to mention the personal toll exacted at an individual level, their co -existence will be more detrimental. 10. Tobac co raises blood sugar levels Raised blood sugar lev els have numerous medical cons equences, one of whi ch is a deceleration of the wound h ealing process. According to Wound Care Centers, high blood sugar, which can be caused by smoking, creates arterial stiffness and narrows the b lood vessels. KEY TAKE AWAY Tobacco has adverse effects on oral as well as gen eral health of an individual and it negatively affects the outcome of almost all therapeutic procedures performed in the oral cavity leading to d ry socke t, Implant Failure, Delayed Wound healing, Staining and Fracture of Restorations, Dental pain etc. Tobacco is dead ly in any form either be smoking or smokeless; scientific evidence has proved that to bacco leads to disease, disability, and death. Tobacco smoke contains more than 7000 chemicals, of which at least 69 are known to cause cancer. Smokeless to bacco contains over 3000 chemicals, 250 of which a re toxic an d 30 of these are carcinogens that c ause mainly c ancers of or al cavity, oropharynx, esophagu s, pancreas, urinary bladder and uterine cervix . 40 CONCLUSION Tobacco has a dverse effects on or al as well as general health of an individual and it negatively affects the outcome of almost all therapeutic pro cedu res performed in the oral cavity leading to dry socket, Impla nt Failure, Delayed Wound healing, Staining and Fracture of Restorations, Dent al pain. It is also linked to a detrimental impact on oral health, such as increasing risk of periodontal (gum) diseases. In addition, dental implant failure is mo re common amon g smoke rs than among non - smokers, and peri -implantitis among smokers is also more prevalent. Tobacco use contributes to increased tooth mobility and tooth loss occurs leading to reduced oral chew ing function and quality of life. Dental treatm ent outcom es may be unpredictable for pati ents who continue to smoke tobacco. 41 ASSESSMENT 1. What is the addictive substance in tobacco? a. Tolue ne b. Nicotine c. Arsenic d.

Tobacco leaves are processed into smokeless and smoked products after harvesting and c uring. Nicotine acts on the bra in and other parts of the nervous system. From tobacco smoke the nicotine enters the bloo dstream through the lungs and in smokeless t obacco it pas ses through the mucosal membrane of mouth and nose or the skin. Pulmonary absor ption, which is the most favour ed and perhaps commonest, occurs in a matter of seconds. From the lu ngs, chemicals in the smoke are absorbed into the bod y's systems and ca rried q uickly to different parts of the body. Oral, snuffs and other smokeless tobacco products are absorbed more gradually. After absorption, nicotine travels rapidly and reaches the brain within seven seconds; it readily crosses the bl ood-brain bar rier. Due to action of the resultant release of dopamine from mid -brain and its effect on pr e-frontal cortex, there is sudden r elease of glucose and increase in respiration, heart rate, constriction of arteries and increased alertness. These psycho-active rewar ds occu r quickly and these rewards are highly reinforced. This forms the basis of nicot ine addiction in an individual . Thu s, broadly using b ehavioural perspective, addiction in general can be understood as an impaired ability to inhibit drug seeking in response to environmental information that should normally suppress the behaviour. LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the professionals should be able to understand t he Nature of nicotine as a substance and its effects Neurological mechanism of nicotine addiction Processes that maintain addiction Various screenin g tools used for assessing nicotine depen dence 5. ADDICTION PROCESS AND MEASUREMENT OF NICOTINE D EPENDENCE 5 0 44 Neurob iologically , addiction is link ed to alterations in reward and other circuitry that may precede initial drug use (e.g., genetic risk factors) and/or be caused by chronic drug exposure itself. The role of nicotine as the pharmacologic agent that maintains to bacco addiction is well suppor ted. It is indeed associated with many well -known pleasurable psycho active effects, such as arousal, relaxation, and impr oved mood. Th e fol lowing section will highlight the role of nicotine and the neurobiological mechanism in tobacco dependence. NICOTINE AND ITS EFFECTS Nicotine is derived from the leafy green tobacco plant (Blum, 1984 ). Nicotine is absorbed through the membra nes of the mout h, nose, and lungs (Blum, 1984). Once in the bloodstream, it is metabolized by the live r. The half -life of nic otine is 20 to 30 min. Nicotine exerts its effects on the body by al tering the operation of norepinephrine and acetylchol ine. Nicot ine provides th e pick-me-up feeling to the tobacco -users. A new smoker or tobacco chewer may experienc e nausea and dizziness from first using tobacco. But with repeated use he/she becomes tolerant to these effects. The tobacco user needs to take the \"drug\" repeate dly to maintain the nicotine levels and the \"rewarding\" experience it produces e.g., changing the puff frequency or d egree of inh aling. Fig. 5.1 Mechanism of Action Over time, most people need an increasing level of nicotine to produce the same response, which results in using tobacco more fre quently or changing t o a stronger brand or type of to bacco to fulfil th e addic tion. For these reasons, tobacco experts and recent guidelines must emphasize the reframing of previous percep tions and understan d that tobacco dependence is a chronic disease. In the prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cort ex signals drug-induced cravin gs \"vote\" for drug ingestion The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex interprets the v arious signals, show ing cogn itive flexibility deci des whether to take action of drug ingestion Impulsive choice is signaled to the VTA to release dopamine in the nucleus accumbens Drug Anticipation In turn produce s output to engage in behavior that led to drug ingestion again 45 Fig. 5.2 Effects of Nicotin e NICOTINE ADDICTION Nicotine interacts (42 and stimulates dopaminergic transmission. This in turn sti mulates the reward center and is responsible for the mood elevation and apparent improvem ent in cognitive function. With chronic stimulatio n by nicotine the GABAergic neurons are desens itized and thus lose their inhibitory effect on dopamine. This in turn reinforces the addiction by inducing craving. Nicotine not only caus es damaging effects, it also leads to tolerance to its own action like other dependence producing drugs . NEUROBIOLOG Y OF ADDICTION Drugs of abuse activate brain reward systems; Reward is defined herein as any event that increases the probability of a res ponse with a positive hedonic component. Dopamine neurotransmitter has been assigned the central role and regulates t he reward pathway, the mesolimbic pathway from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens seems to be crucial for reward. The activation caused by drugs of abuse can eventually cause changes in r eward circuitry that are associated with a vic ious cycle of drug preoccupation, craving, addiction, dependence, and withdrawal. There are two mechanisms: that direct the reward system: The reactive reward s ystem comprising of systems such as the VTA, nucle us accumbens and amygdala, are involved in tri ggering the drug -seeking behavior using internal cues such as craving and withdrawal The reflective system receives projections from the orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC) which is involved in regulating impulses, the n projections from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regulating whether an action takes place, projectio ns from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex 46 (VMPFC) involved in regul ating emotions. This system is built and maintained over time based on various influences; including genetics, peer p ressure, learning of social rules etc. Fig. 5.3 Neurological Effects of Nicotine Addiction can be conceptual ized as a three -stage, recurring cycle \u2014binge/intoxication, withdrawa l/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation (craving) \u2014that worsen s over time and involves neuroplastic changes in the brain reward, stress, and e xecutive function System ( Koob et al, 2016). 47 Binge/Intoxication (reward and incentive salience) Steep release to dopamine as a result of drug-use is associated with the subjective feeling of \"so- called high\", which then becomes conditioned and leads to cravings for the substance. Withdraw/Nega tive Affect (As tolerance and withdrawal develop, brain stress system recruited in the extended amygdala and contribute to the development of negative emotiona l states.) Preoccupation/Anticipation This is d riven by the prefrontal cortex (executive funtion s) is heightened by drug cue - induced reward seeki ng impacting functions such as self -regulation and inhi bitory c ontrol leading to craving. 1.

Experimenting with Tobacco Fig. 5.4 Stages of Development of Nicotine Addiction The initiation and d evelopment of tobacco -use progresses in stages: Fig. 5.5 Addiction Cycle 48 Processes that Maintain the Addiction Cycle We have understood the neurobiological bases of addiction and the role of the different neurotransmitters in the addiction process. It is also important to under stand the various psychological mechanisms/process es that maintain the substance taking b ehavior of the individual. When the nicotine is supplied regularly to the brain it starts to yearn for more, this phenomenon is called craving. If the brain does not receive its dose of nicotine while it craves, the body develops withdrawal symptoms. Once the pe rson satisfies his/her brain's urge to have the next fix of nicotine, w ithdrawal symptoms subside temporarily. This cycle continues and thi s is when one is said to be having biolo gical dependence The other important processes that maintain the substa nce-taking behaviour of the individual are called habituation or conditionin g; these are based on the learning principles of Behavioural perspec tive. Tobacco -use is accompanied by certa in activities, which may vary among individuals. These activities often become associated with the act of using the substance and become condition ed- cues as they are repeatedly paired with the act itself. The asso ciation between tobac co-use and other even ts repeated many times causes the environmental situations to become powerful cues for the urge to use tobacco Conditioning develops because of a pairing of the pharmacologic actions of the drug with behaviours and events. Likewise, as pects of the drug -taking process, such as the mani pulation of smoking materials, or the taste, smell, or feel of smoke in the throat, become associated with the pleasu rable effects of substance -use. Even unpleasant moods can become conditioned cues for consuming tobacco. For example, a smoker may learn th at not having a cigarette provokes irritab ility (a common symptom of the nicotine abstinence syndrome) and smoking a cigarette provides relief. 49 Easy availability of tobacco produc t Environm ental Influences Using Tobacco Nicotine Action in the body - Nicotine interacts with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and stimulates the dopaminergic trans mission. This in turn stimulates the reward centr e which leads to mood elevation and improveme nt in cogn itive function. GAB Aergic neurons inhibit effect on dopamine and reinforce the addiction inducing craving Neurocircuitry Reward System regulated by the Dopami ne pathways (VTA). Other neurotransmitters, including Dependence In a nutshell, the process of Nicoti ne Addiction and the underlying mecha nisms can be understood through th e following flowchart: Fig. 5.6 Nicotine Addiction and M echanism 50 DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR TOBACCO USE DISORDER (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition) (DSM -5) Acco rding to the Diagnost ic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (American Psychiatric Association) there are three Criterion with 15 sub features, and four specifiers to dia gnose Tobacco Use disorder: A problematic pattern of tobacco use lea ding to clinically si gnificant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12- month period: A. Larger quantities of tobacco over a longer period than intended are consumed. 1. Unsuccessful efforts to quit or reduce intake of tobacco 2. Inordinate amount of time acquiring or using tobacco pr oducts 3. Cravings for tobacco 4. Failure to attend to responsibilities and obligations due to tobacco use 5. Continu ed use despite adverse social or interpersonal consequences 6. Forfeit ure of social, occupa tional or recreational activities in favor of tobacco use 7. Tobacco use in hazardous situations 8. Continued use despite awareness of physical or psychological problems directly attributed to tobacco use B. Tolerance for nicotine, as indica ted by: 9. Need for increasingly larger doses of nicotine in order to obtain the desire d effect a noticeably diminished effect from using the same amounts of nicotine C. Withdrawal symptoms upon cessation of use as indicated by 10. The onset of typical nicotine a ssociated withdr awal symptoms is present 11. More nicotine or a substitute d drug is taken t o alleviate withdrawal symptoms The clinician may also add the following specifiers: 1. Early remission - No use of Tobacco products for 3 -13 months. 2. Sustained remission - No use of Tobacco products for > 12 mos. 3. On maintenance therapy - e.g., transdermal nicot ine. 4. In a controlled environm ent- e.g., hospital or correctional facility where smoking is forbidd en. Additional specifiers indicate the level of severity of Tobacco use disorder 1. 305.1 (Z72.0) Mild: 2-3 symptoms are present. 2. 305.1 4-5 symptoms are present. 3. 305.1 (F17.200) Severe: 6 or more Symptoms are present. 51 6C4A Disorders due to use of nicotine Disorders due to use of nicotine are charact erized by the patter n and consequences of nicotine use. Nicotine is the active dependence -producing constituent of the tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum. Nicotine is used overwhelmingly through smoking cigarettes. Increasingly, it is also used in electronic cigarettes that vap orize nicotine dissolved in a carrier solvent for i nhalation (i.e., \"va ping\"). Pipe smoking, chewin g tobacco and inhaling snuff are minor forms of use. Nicotine is a hi ghly potent addictive compound and is the third most common psychoac tive substance used worldwide after caffeine and alcohol. Nicotine Depe ndence and Nicotine Withdrawal are well describe d and Nicotine - Induced Mental Disorders are recognized. Diagnostic Categories that Apply to Nicotine Following is a list of specific diagnostic categories of that apply to nicotine: 6C4A.0 Episode of Harm ful Use of Nicotine 6C4A.1 Harmful Pattern of Use Specified Disorder Due to Use of Nicotine 6C4A.Z Disorder Due to Use Nicotine dependence Nicotine dependen ce is a disorder of regulation of nicotine use arising from repeated or continuous use of nicotine. The characteristic feature is a stron g internal drive to u se nicotin e, which is manifested by impaired abili ty to control use, increasing p riority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or neg ative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a sub jective sensation of urge or craving to use nicotine. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, includin g tolerance to the effects of nicotine, withdrawal symptoms followin g cessation or reduction in use of nicotine, or repeated use of nico tine or pharmacologic ally simila r substances to prevent or alleviate wi thdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnos is may be made if nicotine use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 month s. Exclusio ns: Episode of harmful use of nicotin e (6C4A.0) Harmful pattern of use of nicotine (6C4A.1) 6C4A.20 Nicotine dependence, current use Current nicotine nicotine -use within the past month. Exclusions: Episo de of harmful use of nicotine (6C4A.0 ) Harmful pattern of 52 6C4A.21 Nicotine dependen ce, early full remission After a diagnosis of nicotine dependence, and often following a treatment episode or other intervention (including self -help intervention), the individual has b een abstinent from nicotine durin g a period lasting from between 1 and 12 months. Exclusions: Episode of harmful use of nicotine (6C4A.0), Harmful pattern of use of nicotine (6C4A.1) 6C4A.22 Nicotine dependence, sustained partial remiss ion After a diagnosi s of nicotine dependence, and often following a treatment episode or other intervention (including self-help intervention), there is a significant reduction in nicotine consumption for more than 12 months, such that even though intermittent or continuing nicotine use has occurred during this period, the definitional requireme nts for dependence have not been met. Exclusions: Episode of harmful u se of nicotine (6C4A.0) Harmful of use of nicotine (6C4A.1) depe ndence, sustained full remission After a diagnosi s of nicotine dependence, and often following a treatment episode or other intervention (including self-intervention) , the person has been abstinent from nicotine for 12 months or longe r. Exclusions: Episode of harmful use of nicotin e (6C4A.0) Harmful pattern of use of nicotine (6C4A.1) 6C4A.4 Nicotine withdrawal Nicotine withdrawal is a clinically significant cluster of symptoms, behaviours and/or physiological features, varying in d egree o f severity and duration, that occurs upon ce ssation or reduction of use of nicotine (typically used as a constitue nt of tobacco) in individuals who have developed Nicotine dependenc e or have used nicotine for a prolonged period or in large amounts. Present ing features o f Nicotine withdrawal may incl ude dysphoric or dep ressed irritability, anger, anxiet y, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, bradycardia, increased appetite, and craving for tobacco (or other nicotine -containing produ cts. Ot her physical s ymptoms may include increased cough and mouth ulceration. SCREENING FOR NICOTINE DEPEN DENCE Screening or assessment of tobacco -use makes it possible to detect the presence and severity of the same in a cost and time eff icient m anner. It als o provides a baseline assessment along with pe riodic checkpoints as the patient moves in the process of cessation. Th e diagnosis of Nicotine Dependence can be based on diagnostic criteria provided by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manu al (DSM) of the Ameri can Psychiatric Association and the Internatio nal Classification of Disease 10th revision (ICD - 10) from the World He alth Organization (WHO). 53 Additionally, there are several tools that can be helpful in assessing the level of severity , depend ence or tolerance to the substance used. Following are some of the most commonly used tools for screening/assessme nt of substance -use: S.NO . NAME OF THE TEST DESCRIPTION 1. Fage rstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) The Fagerstrom test for nicotin e dependence (FTND) is widely used as a screening test for the physical aspects of nicotine dependence. There are scales for both smoking and smokeless tobacco. Based on the score, the level of addiction can be low (score less than 4), medium (scor e 4- 6) or high (scor e greater than 6). 2. Modified Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence - Smokeless Tobacco (FTND Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence (FTND) for Smokele ss Tobacco consists of 6 items and the total score comes out to be 10. Based on the score , the level of addiction can be low (score less th an 4), medium (score 4 -6) or high (score greater th an 6). 2. Tobacco Depe ndence Screener (TDS) The Tobacco Depende 10-item questionnaire for screening tobacco/ nicotine dependence according to these criteria. 3. Wisconsin Inv entory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM -68) The W isconsin Inventory of Smokin g Dependence Motives (WISDM -68) is a multidimensional measure of dependence based on theoretically grou nded motive s for drug use. The measure has 68 items consisting of 13 domains that identify separate motives for tobacco use. 4. Cigarette Dependence Scale (CDS) The Cigarette Dependence Scale was developed by asking smokers via mail and through a web si te to asses s signs indicating a dependence on cigarettes. There are two types of scale, the CDS -12 and the CDS -5, each of whi ch is rated using a 5-point sc ale. The CDS -12 is a 12 -item inst rument covering the main components of the DSM -IV and ICD -10 and some of the FT ND. 5. The Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS) The Nicotine Depend ence Syndrome Scale (NDSS) is mensional questionnaire based on Edwards's syndromal conceptual ization of dependence. The essential elements of syndrome that Edwar ds proposed are as follows: a narrowing in the repertoire of drug use b ehaviour, an increased salience of drug -seeking behavi our, an increased tolerance to the drug, repeated withdrawal symptoms, repeated relief or avoidance of withdrawal symptoms by furth er drug use , subjecti ve awareness of a compulsion to use the drug, and rapid reinforce ment of the syndrome after relapse. With these concepts applied to nicotine dependence, a 23- item que stionnaire was developed.

Screening or assessment of tob acco-use ma kes it possible to detect the presence and severity of the same in a cost and time efficient ma nner. 55 INTRODUCTION According to GATS -2 (2016 -17), 55% of smokers an d 50% of smokeless tob acco users are planning or thinking of quitting tobacco use. However, quitting is challenging and most smokers make multiple attempt s before successfully quitting . There is significant evidence tha t has highlighted that both behaviou ral therapies and phar macotherap y can help quit, eith er on their own or in combination with one another . Behavioural interventions (BI) in tobacco cessation v ary widely in their content, delivery and availability. Typica lly, they focus on, informing the us er, giving advice to q uit or a c ombination of both, u sing different the oretical models to achieve these aims. BIs can also range from br ief advice to providin g Information Education and Communication (IEC) material, to m ore intensive programmes involving multiple counselling se ssions . Factors that seem to pr ompt quit attempts are typically related to motiva tion, such as concern over the longterm health effects or the financial cost of tobacco -use. The factors associated with longterm success after a quit attempt mostly relate to the strength of the underlying addiction to tobacco. However, most attempts are made without the aid of appro priate behavioural suppo rt. Hence, in order to maintain motivation and improve resilience through the quitting process, various components of BI can play a vital role. Dentists are well suited to engage patients in tobacco cessation counselling because of the relative ease with which they discuss the dental concerns during the interactive chairside communication. LEARNING OBJECTIV ES At the end of this chapter, the professionals should be able to understand the Need for Behavioural Interventions in Tobacco Cessation Basic counselling techniques used for Tobacco Cessation Types of Behavioural Interven tions in Dental Clinical Interv entions (5A's, 5R's, in Behav ioural Inte rventions 6. BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTIONS FOR TOBACCO CESSATION IN DENTAL SETTINGS 6 0 56 Tobacco -use mostly reflects during the oral examination and the time spent during dental care with the dental professional can be used as an effec tive opportunity to prom ote cessation. In an Indigenous study, 44% of interns reported that they had not been taught Tobac co-use Cessation in the institutions. Furthermore, a higher level of oral cancer awareness did not have a positive impact on the perce ption of Tobacco Cessati on Counselling. This enormous demand needs to be catered and the professionals have to be well equ ipped with the techniques of tobacco cessation. NEED FOR BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS 1. Tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that for the majority of tobacco users requires repeated and persistent effort to overcome. Hence, it can be understood as a powerf ul biological and social process that strongly impedes achieving and sustaining cessation. 2. The second is that tobacco dependence is often accompanied by unrea listic fears about treatment as well as the assumption that treatment really is not needed. This is typical across addictions and is sometimes referred to as the \"denial\" or \"rationalization\" factor because of the tendency of addict ed persons to deny that they are truly addicted and need help, and because they may assume that treatment is riskier than the disease. BASIC COUNSELING TECHNIQUES Guidance in counselling focuses on helping people make important choices that affect thei r lives, such as choosin g a preferred lifestyle. According to the 20/20: A Vision for the Future of Counselling consortium, counselling is defined as a professional relationship that empowers diverse individuals, families, and groups to accomplish mental health, wellness, educati on, and career goals. According to the American Counselling Association (ACA), professional counsellin g is the process of building relationships with individuals that empower them to accomplish mental health and wellness, education , and c areer goals. It i s a collaborative relationship between the counsellor and their client. The skills that every counsello r should possess include; communication skills, listening and attending skills, focusing and paraphrasing, validating and encoura ging in a non -judgmental manner. Dental professionals in clinical practice with patients due to the nature of care and communic ate regarding routine dental care and plans with patients. The following explains the characteristics of counselling in detail: 1. Attendin g and Active Listening : Maintain eye contact, have a kind tone to your voice, express interest by leaning forward, noddi ng. During a session with a client, counsellor must also project that they have a vested and genuine interest in the patient's wellbeing . Positive attending behaviours open up communication and encourage free expression. In contrast, negative attendin g behaviours inhibits free expression. Ivey and Ivey (1999) identify four dimensions of simple attending behaviour that have been s tudied, to some extent, cross - culturally. They include: a. Eye contact : eye contact is just one method of making interpersonal contact; it usually does not involve intense scrutiny of pupil dilation PROFESSIONAL INSIGHT Qualities of an Effective Counsellor: 1. Expressing Empathy 2. Keeping Confidentiality 3. Respecting others 4. Maintaining warmth 5. Being non-judgm ental 57 b. Body language: Two aspects of body language are known technically as kinesics and proxemics . Kinesics has to do with variables associated with physical features and physical movement of an y body part, such as eyes, face, head, hands, legs, and shoulders. Proxemics refers to personal space and environmental varia bles such a s the distanc e between two people and whether any objects are between them. c. Vocal qualities: Paralinguistics consis ts of voice loudness, pitch, rate, and fluency. Effective interviewers use vocal qualities to enhance rapport, communicate interes t and empat hy, and empha size specific issues or conflicts. d. Verbal tracking: It is crucial for counsellors to accurately track what clients say. Counsellors also demonstrate they are tracking the content of their clients' speech by occasionally repeating ke y words and phrases. 2. Questioning : Using more open -ended questions (questions that give the person a chance to further explain - for e.g., \"what makes you want to use tobacco?\", \"what happens if you don't chew tobacco after having a meal?\", \"When do you ex perience crav ings the mo st?\"), elicits more relevant information and enhances interviewer control. It also allows the clients to talk or encourage them or to reflect on something specific to the problem. 3. Paraphrasing: it involves restating or rewording ano ther person's verbal com munication. In clinical interviewing, the paraphrase is sometimes referred to as a reflection of content (this refers to the fact that paraphrases reflect the content of what clients are saying, but not process or feelings). A parap hrase or refl ection of c ontent is a statement that accurately reflects or rephrases what the client has said. [For e.g., the pat ient said that when the job becomes overwhelming, I tend to take several smokes, the counsellor rephrased it as, \"When you feel experience stress, you end up taking multiple smokes.\" ] 4. Summarization: Summarization demonstrates accurate listening, enhances client and interviewer recall of major themes, helps clients focus on important issues, and extracts or refines the meaning behin d client mess ages. It sh ould be informal, interactive, and supportive. Instead of saying, \"Here is my summary of what you've said,\" something like this can be said, \"Let's make sure I'm keeping up with the main things you've talked about. 58 Fig. 6.1 Active List ening STRUC TUR E AND STAGES IN TOBACC O CESSATION COUNSELLING Structure in counselling is defined as \"a joint under standi ng between the counsellor and client regarding the characteristics, conditions, procedures, and parameters of counselling\". Structure he lps clarify the counsellor -client re lationship and give it direction; protect the rights, roles, and obligations of both counsellors and clients; and ensure the success of counselling . Counselling progresses through systematic stages starting from the init ial session , which focuses on buildi ng rapport followed by problem identifying and later progressing to the workin g stag e and terminating by emphasising relapse. Fig. Chart -6.2: Stages In Tobacco Cessation Counseling Body Language : lean forward using an attentive Emotionally: Empath ize with th e patient's struggle Ears : Actively pay attention to the information Eyes : Watch a nd obser ve Mouth : speak paraphrasing and clarifying ACTIVE LISTENING 59 TYPES OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS Behavioural interventions take the form of advice, discussion, encouragement, and other activities designed to help quit attempts succeed. Intervent ions generally employ behaviour change techniques, addressing factors such asself -efficacy and motivation (often using motivational interviewing techniques). Brief advice for tobacco cessation from a dental health care profe ssiona l is effective in promotin g cessation. This form of advice, particularly from general practitioners (GPs), leads 1 to 3 out of 100 smoke rs receiving it to stop smoking for at least 6 months. Depending on the time at hand and the structure of interven tion, the two types of Behaviour al interventions are: Fig. 6.3 Brief Intervention These are discussed in more detail below: 1. Very -brief Advice (VBA) - is a simple, person/patient centered approach that dental professionals can deliver effectively i n less than 60 seconds if time pressures are such. When using VBA, professionals are encouraged to ask patients about their tobacco use, acknow ledging that they may have tried to stop many times in the past, and to discuss the options that exist to support a quit attempt, that is, beha vioural support and pharm acotherapy. PROFESSIONAL INSIGHT Most clinicians feel discou raged when patients they are workin g with show resistance or have no desire to quit. It is impor tant to u nderstand why people don't want to change. Foll owing co uld be some of the reasons: Happy/satisfi ed with the current behaviors They feel it is easier to keep using and don't want to face the discomfort They are unaware of the risks and problems associated with their behavior They fe el that the risks and problem s are only limited to few p eople, they ar e not among them. 1. Very Brief Intervention (VBA) It is an evidence -based intervention designed to increase quit attempts among people who smoke. It is designed to deliver effective advice without taking up too much time or harming relationships with patients 2. Brief Interventions (BI) Brief advice/intervention using the 5As approach or the 5R's for the resistant quit. Dentists and other oral health professionals also have an ideal opportunity during dental health checks to ask about their patients' smoking status and provide smoking cessation information and advice. 60 Fig.-6.4: V BA model 2. Brief Interventions - These interventions are delivered in the form of advice which primarily triggers a cessation attempt. Simple advice from a physician has been sh own to increase abstinence rates significantly (by 30%) compared to no advice (Fiore et al., 2000). The Brief Interventions include FRAM ES model, 5A's approach, 5R's: a. Brief interventions aim to identify current or potential problems with tobacco use and motivate those at risk to chang e their tobacco use behav iour. b. Brief interventions in primary care can range from 5 minutes of brief advice to 15- 30 minutes of brief counselling. c. The aim of the intervention is to help the patient understand that their tobacc o use is putting them at risk and to encourage them to reduce or give up their tobacco use. d. Brief interventions should be personalized and offered in a supportive, non-judgmental manner. e. Tobacco cessation interventions by more than one type of healt h profe ssional (including dentists) have the potential to sub stantially increase the cessation rate and promote the readiness to quit in the general population. f. A study reported that incorporation of an oral examination component in the dental clinic or co mmunity setting as part of behaviour al interventions for toba cco cessation conducted by oral health professionals may increase tobacco abstinen ce rates among both cigarette smokers and smokeless tobacco users. g. In another study, brief intervention by denta l profe ssionals, performed by utiliz ing feedback on oral symp toms and dental treatments specifically relevant to smoking, potentially motivated smokers with respect to their attempts to quit smoking; furthermore, it promoted behavioural changes toward quitting. ASK ADVIS E REFER ACT on patient's response: b uild confidence, give information, prescribe Refer the patient to resources that will assist them in quitting: this can be in the form of referral t o a nearby TCC, or educate about other options such as quit lines etc. Advise on the best way o f quitting ( e.g., cold turkey \"stop using tobacco completely immediately\" or tapering in which the tobacco user gradually reduces the tobacco - use) The best appr oach is a combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioural support Ask about Tobacco -use (Is the patient curr ent or past tobacco -user) Record Tobacco -use Status 61 Research into effective bri ef interventions for toba cco use have found that they include a number of consistent features which appear to contribute to their effectiveness. These have been summarized using the acronym FRAMES : F- FEEDBACK The provisi on of p ersonally relevant feedbac k is a key component of b rief intervention and generally follows a thorough assessment of tobacco use and related problems. Feedback can include information about the individual's tobacco -use and problems from a screening i nstrume nt, information about pers onal risks associated wit h current tobacco -use patterns, and general information about tobacco use related ris ks and harms. The patient can be educated about various dental concerns such as staining, loose teeth, bleeding g ums, wh ite patch etc. R- RESPONSI BILITY A key principle of intervention with tobacco users is to acknowledge that they are responsible for their own behaviour and that they can make choices about their tobacco use. The message that \"What you do with your tobacco use is up to you\" and tha t \"Nobody can make you ch ange or decide for you\" enables the patient to retain personal control over their beha viour and its consequences. This sense of control has been found to be an important element in motivation for change and to decrease resistance. A- ADVICE The central component of effective brief interventions is the provision of clear and personalized advice regarding the harms associated with continued use. Patients are often unaware that their current pattern of tobacco use could lead to health or other problems or make existing problems worse. Providing clear advice that cutting down or stopping tobacco use will reduce their risk of future problems will increase their awareness of their personal risk and provide reasons to consider changing their behaviour. M- MENU OF ALTERNATIVE CHANGE OPTIONS Providing alternative strategies to cut down or stop their t obacco use, allows patients to choose the strategy most suitable for their situation and which they feel will be most he lpful. Providing choi ces reinforces the sense of personal control and responsibility for making change and can help to strengthen the patient's motivation for change. These options can include: Keeping a diary of tobacco -use (where, when, how much, who wit h, why) Identifying high-risk situations and strategies to avoid or overcome them Identifying other activities instead of tobacco -use - hobbies, sports etc. Fig. 6.5 FRAMES ( Effectiv e Brief Interventions for Tobacco ) 62 Providing information about other self-help resources, written information and informing about the national Quitline. E- EMPATHY A consistent component of effective brief interventions is a warm, reflective, empathic and understanding approach by the dental professional delivering the intervention. Use of a warm, empathic style is a significant f actor i n the patient's res ponse to the intervention and leads to reduced tobacco use at follow -up. S- SELF -EFFICACY (CONFIDENCE) The final comp onent of effective brief interventions is to encourage patients' confidence that they are able to make changes in their tobacco -use behavi our. It is particularly h elpful to elicit self -efficacy statements from patients such as \"I know I have the strong will to quit tobacco\" \"I know I can manage my desire to use tobacco with adequate help and social support\" and \"I be lieve i t is my inner stre ngth that can help me quit the tobacco habit\". MODES OF DELIVERY The most common and readily available interventions take the form of: Fig. 6.6: Intervention Strategies The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) (The Stages of Chan ge Mode l) Prochaska, DiClemente and Norcross (1992) provide a compre hensive model for concept ualizing patients' motivation for change. In case of tobacco users, they move from being content in consuming tobacco, to thinking about quitting, planning to quit , maint aining cessation or having a relapse. It proposes that people move through various sta ges while making a behavior change and that the whole process can take anywhere from 6 months to 5 years. Behavioural Counselling (face -to-face/ telephonic counselling) Use of Technologies (text -based cessation interventions like mCessation ) Educating using Self-help material Group Behaviour therapy programmes 63 Fig. 6.7: Stages of Change Model by Prochaska and DiClement e' Benefits of Change, Cost of Staying the Same Benef its of Staying the Staying the Same, Costs of Chan ge Temptat ion - Habit/Craving, Social situatio ns, Negative Effect Situations Decisional Balan ce Pros and Cons 2.

Behavioural: Self-liberation, Reinforcement, Helpful Relationships *Action TTM Constructs Fig. 6.8: Schematic View of TTM Constructs Individuals progress through the various stages of change and it is essential that the intervention provided is relevant to the stage of change. The patient may quit after the stage of maintenance or go to the stage of relapse. The specific in terventions for relapse m anagement will be discussed in the following chapter. Below the relevant ways of intervention are mentioned below as per the requirement per stage: 64 Stage 1. PRE -CONTEMPLATION (Not really thinkin g about changing) DESCRIPTION INTER VEN TION Individuals at this stage were \"happy - users\" They do not have any worries about their Tobacco -use of and do not want to change. They don't see it as risky or problematic. Individuals in t his sta ge are unlikely to respond to advice to chang e their behavior. They may be receptive to information about the risks associated with their tobacco -use. Table 6.1 : Stage 1 Pre -Contemplation Stage of TTM Stage 2. CONTEMPLATION (Thinking about cutting down or stopping Tobacco -use) DESCRIPTION INTERVENTION Individuals at this stage are ambivalent about their tobacco use. They can see both the pros and cons of use. They have some awareness of the problem associated with tobacco - use At this stage the focus is on providing information about their tobac co-use related risks, advice to cut down or stop. The aim is to encourage them to talk about the pros and cons. A helpful tool at this stage is to see ambivalence about substance use as a balance Table 6.2 : Stage 2 Contemplation Stage of TTM Stage 3. PREPARATION (Ready to cut down or stop Tobacco -use) DESCRIPTION INTERVENTION These tobacco users are planning to quit in the next 30 days and have usually made a 24- hour quit attemp t in the past year. This group is motiva ted to quit soon and is the group most likely to actually attempt to quit in the near future. This stage is a window of opportunity, which may only open for a short time, and is the group most likely to ask f or help with quitting. The focus should be on developing a quit plan and identifying the possible factors that are the cause of tobacco -use for the individual. Table 6.3: Stage 3 Preparation Stage of TTM 65 Stage 4. ACTION (Doing something abou t changing their behavior) DESCRIPTION INTER VENTION The individual may be abstaining or cutting down, or have decided to change their established behaviour. People in this stage are likely to continue to feel ambivalent about their substance use and to need encouragement and support to maintain their decisio n. Negotiating aims and goals for changing risky behaviors together by suggesting a range of strategies. Identifying high risk situations Discussing the plan of action and emphasizing self-efficacy and self- confidence . Table 6.4: Stage 4 Action Stage of TTM Stage 5. MAINTANENCE (Keeping on with the new behavior) DESCRIPTION INTERVENTION The person is attempting to maintain the behavior changes that have been made. Long -term success means remaining in this stage. Individua ls need affirmation that they are doing a good job and encouragement to continue. Providing praise for successes and reinforcing the patient's strategies for avoiding situations where they are at risk of relapse or helping them to move on after a small lapse. Table 6.5: Stage 5 Maintenance Stage of TTM STEPS IN EVIDENCE -BASED INTERVENTIONS Clinical Practice Guideline concluded that there is a dose -response relationship between the intensity of counselling and quitting success \u2014that is, the greate r the intensity of counselling, the higher the likelihood an individual will quit. Behavioural treatment approaches equip tobacco users with practical strategies to avoid and/or cope with triggers, manage cravings, and reduce withdrawal symptoms . These interventi ons often cover a wide variety of topics \u2014 including advice on quitting smoking; assessment of prior quit attempts and lessons that can be drawn from them; assessment of current motivation to quit; identification of cues and triggers for smoking and ways to avoid or manage them. The most effective intervention can be provided by professionals when they come in contact with the patient in hospital, OPD or community setting in a brief opportunistic and time -limited manner. It is essential that the intervention must be tailor -made as per the needs of the patient. The following diagram is a helpful resource for dental professionals in assessing the treatment needs of the patients as per nicotine addic tion: 66 Fig. 6 .9 Steps in Evidence -Based Interventio ns The standard interventions mentioned below include: The 5A's approach to tobacco cessation The 5R's approach to tobacco cessation for patients not willing to quit Motivational Interviewi ng Intervention I. The 5A's Mode l for Brief Intervention As a framework, the 5A's method is considered the gold standard for delivering a brief tobacco cessation intervention. Implementation of the 5A's by physicians is effective in increasing tobacco cessation and quit attempts among p atients and in increasi ng engag ement among pa tients in other empirically validated cessation treatments (Quinn et al. 2009). Fig. 6.10 5A's Model for Brief Intervention Behavioural Dependence: Breaking the tobacco use finding substitut es Psychological Depe ndence: Managing Cravings, Stress Management, Relaxation, Exercise Psychological Depe ndence: Managing Cravings, Stress Management, Relaxation, Exercise ASK ADVISE ASSESS ASSIST ARRANGE For a patient willing to make a quit attempt, offer medication and behavioural counselling For a patient not willing to quit, introduce interventions such as 5R's or motivational Interviewing Assess the patient's readiness to quit, is the user willing to make a quit attempt at this time? In a clear, strong and personalised manner, urge every tobacco user to quit. Ask, identify and document tobacco -use status for every patient at every visit Arrange for a patient willing to make a quit -attempt with follow -ups, beginning within the first week after the quit date. 67 STEP 1: ASK When to ASK: 1. As part of the vital signs at the beginning of a visit 2. When taking a history Ask always while assessing the personal history 3. During a physical examination Ask ALL Individuals Identify every tobacco user status. Identify the tobacco status of a child's parents/caregiver s for conditions potentially impacted by second -hand smoke. Determine if a person: Does he/she smoke / chew Does smoke/ chew Recently quit (<1 year). Ask, \"Do you currently smoke or use tobacco?\" If no, ask \"Have you quit in the past year?\" Ask adults acc ompanying children, \"Does anyone in your / this child's household smoke?\" Ask children over the age of 10, \"Have you ever smoked a cigarette or do you use any variety of smokeless tobacco [specify] ?\" POSITIVELY REINFORCE non-smoking, particularly with adolescents. ASK about Type, Quantity and History \"What kind of tobacco do you use now?\" \"How often do you smoke / chew?\" \"How many cigarettes (or how much smokeless tobacco) do you use during a typical day?\" Use the Fagerstrom Nicotine Dependence/Tolerance Questionnaire to better quantify severity of tobac co use. ASK about first use and first daily use: Ask non-daily user/identify pattern/ typical day description \"How old were you when you first used tob acco? What kind of tobacco did you use?\" \"How old were you when you first started using tobacco daily?\" Table 6.6: Step 1 Ask Strategy STEP 1: ASK 68 STEP 2: ADVISE Dental Health professionals are in a good position to help users to understand how the general facts about smoking and health apply to them personally and to consider their implic ations. In a clear, strong, and personalized manner, every tobacco user should be urged to quit. Advise those people who use tobacco to QUIT Brief, repetitive, consistent, positive reminders to quit from multi ple providers (or reinforcement of a recent quit attempt) double success rates. Advice and assistance are useful whatever the stage of change a tobacco user is at. Use messages that are clear, strong, personalized, supportive and non -confr ontational . Adap t as per oral diseases Clear \"I think it is important for you to quit smoking and I can help you.\" Strong \"As your doctor, I need you to know that quitting tobacco is the most important thing you can do to protect your health now and in the future. The staff here and I will help you.\" Personalized Tie tobacco -use to current health/illness, significant life events, social and economic costs, motivation level, readiness to quit and/or the impact of second - hand smoke on children and others in the hous ehold. \"I know you're concerned about your bleedin g gums and stains around your teeth while you smile. If you stop chewing and get a dental professional cleaning of your teeth and maintain them, you might be able to maintain your smile. Table 6 .7 Step 2 Advice Strategy STEP 2: ADVIS E 69 (Proc haska's Model) Assess the patients position on the Stages of Behavior Change Cycle The Confidence Ruler \"How conf ident are you that you could cut down or stop your tobacco use if you decided to do it? On a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is not all confident and 10 is extremely confident, how would you rate yours elf? It is not necessary t o actually show the p atient a rule r, but it may be helpful, especially for patients with low literacy and numeracy. For some patient it may be enough to just describe the scale using word like those in the examples given above. The Readiness Ruler The readiness ruler can be used at the beginning of a brief intervention to help target the intervention at the appropriate stage of change or it can be used during the intervention as a way of encouraging the patient to talk about reason of change. \"How import ant is to you to cut down or stop your tobacco use? On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not all importan t, and 10 is extremely important, how wou ld you rate yourself ? Fig. 6.11 Assess Strategy Assess the level of Nicotine Dependence Fagerstrom Nicotine Dependence Scale for smoke or Modified form for smoke less tobacco use STEP 3: ASSESS Assess willingn ess to Quit (For motivated Tobacco-user) Readine ss to Quit Ru ler Confidence to Quit Ruler 70 A) ASSISTING PATIENTS WHO WANT TO QUIT 1. BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING THE MOT IVATION FOR CHANGE: Reinforcing potential benefits o f change (For e.g., better overall health, money will be saved etc.) Build self -efficacy of the patient (For e.g., \"I have the will to refrain from using tobacco) Explore alternative options (For e.g., avoiding tea breaks with tobacco users, engaging in yo ga to manage stressors) Fig. 6.12 : Assisting Patient Who Want to Quit 2. DEVELOPING A \" CHANGE - PLAN\" (Identify what works and what doesn't work , ident ifying triggers) Communicating free choice Information and Advise Consequences of Action and Inaction Managing triggers by substituting activities like; exercise, creative pursuits, meditation/ yoga, journal writing, cooking, chewing gum, eating fruits or vegetables Rewarding desirable behaviour Managi ng environment 3. IDENTIFYING THE APPROACH Option A: Tapering off slowly Progressive reduction: Every day cut down on one or more cigarettes/ bidis /packet than the previous day. Should not extend bey ond 5-7 day s Postpone use: Try putting off the first use of the day by one or two hours. Don't stock . Should not extend beyond a week and the most important dose should be quitted in the last. STEP 3: ASSIST Benefit of change, Cost of staying the same Benefit of staying the staying t he same , Cost of Change 71 Option B: Cold turkey - the abrupt and complete cessation of tobacco -use Set your \"Quit Date\". Before the \"Quit Date\" , make the following changes: Clean up the pl ace! Get rid of reminders of smoking/chewing (Ash trays, empty pockets, etc.). Change your routine. For example, don't smoke/chew during your regular tobacco using times (e.g., the after -lunch beedi or early morning chew) or at regular places (bathrooms, workplace, with friends, etc.). Buy the brand you dislike. Keep a record of the amount and frequency of tobacco used. Decrease the number of puffs while smok ing. Leave large stubs or buy smaller patches Do not inhale deeply or spit away. Note: However, you may also clarify to the patient that the best evidence available is in favour of stopping altogethe r rather than trying to reduce gradually. 4. Summar ize the main steps of the plan and support self -efficacy (Empowering patient to believe in himself/herse lf that they are capable of behaviour change) You may want to suggest that the patient write down the main steps of the plan and both sign it. Give feedbac k, remi nd the person that you are here to help. Table 6.8: Step 3Assist Strategy 72 B) ASSISTING PATI ENTS NOT -WILLING TO QUIT A common situation encountered in the dental practice would be with patients who might not have thought about quitting, or may not be willing to quit. The 5 R's - relevance, risks, rewar ds, roadblocks, and repetition - are the content areas that should be addressed in a motivational counseling intervention applicable in su ch scenarios. 5R'S STRATERGIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPL E RELE VANCE Encourage the patient to indicate how quitting is personally relevant to him or her. Motivatio nal information has the greatest impact if it is relevant to a patient's disease status or risk, family or social situation (e.g., having childre n in the home), health concerns, age, sex, and other important patient characteristics (e.g., prior quitting ex perience, personal barriers to cessation). \"How is quitting most personally relevant to you?\" P: \"I suppose smoking is bad for my health.\" RISK S Encourage the patient to identify potential negative consequence s of tobacco use that are relevant to him or her. Examples of risks are: Acute risks : shortness of breath, exacerbation of asthma, increa sed risk of respiratory infections, harm to pregnanc y, impotenc e, and infertility. Long -term risks : heart attacks and strokes, lung and other cancers (e.g., larynx , oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, osteoporosis, long-term disability, and need for extended care. Environm ental risks: increased risk of lung cancer and heart disease i n spouses; increased risk for low birth -weigh t, sudden infant death syndrome, asthma, middle ear disease, and respiratory infections in ch ildren of smokers. C: \"What do you know about the risks of smok ing To your health? What particularly worries you?\" P: \"I know it causes cancer. That must be awful.\" HCP: \"That's right - the risk of cancer is many times higher among smokers.\" REWARDS Ask the patient to identify potentially relevant benefit s of stoppi ng tobacco use. Examples of rewards could include: Improved oral health; Food will taste better; HCP: \"Do you know how stopping smoking would affect your risk of cancer?\" P: \"I guess it would be more successful if I quit.\" Saving money HCP: \"Yes, and it doesn't 73 Feeling better about oneself Home, car, clothing and breath wi ll smell better Setting a good example for ch ildren and decreasing the likelihood that they will smoke or chew tobacco Feeling better physically Performing better in physical activities Improved app earance, in cluding reduced wrinkling/ ageing of skin and whiter teeth take long for the risk to decrease. But it's important to quit as soon as possible\" ROADBLOCKS Ask the patient to identify barriers or impediments to quitting and provide treatment (problem -solving counselling, medica tion) that could address barriers Typical barriers might include: Withdrawal symptoms Fear of failure Weight gain Lack of support Depression Enjo yment of tobacco Being around other tobacco users Limited knowl edge of effective treatment options DHCP: \"So what would be difficult about quitting for you?\" P: \"Going to the bathroom early in the morning as I suffer from Indigestion.\" DHCP: \"Modifying your diet and regulating your sleep, would help you overcome along with medical support.\" P: \"Wil it really help?\" DHCP: \"We will need to develop a plan, implement and see, this might improve your overall condition.\" REPITITION Repeat assessment of readi ness to quit using the Readiness to quit Ruler . If still not ready to quit, repeat intervention at a later date. The Motivational Interviewing as an intervention should be repeated every time an unmotivated patient visits the clinic setting. HCP: \"So, now we've had a chat, let's see if you feel differently . Can you answer these questions again?\" (Go back to the Assess stage of the 5A's. If ready to quit then proceed with the 5A's. If not ready to quit, end intervention positively by saying \"This is a difficult process but I know you can get through it and I am here to help you\".) *Note: At any point of time duri ng the 5R's, the dental professional must ass ess the willingness to quit and revert back to the 5A's approach for tobacco cessation Table 6.9: Ste p 4 5R'S of Strategies for Implementation for Unwill ing Patient s/ for Patients not willing to quit 74 The follow -ups should be done for patients at 1st, 2nd week , at the end of 1 month and then 3-4 months, 6 months to 1 year for assessments of quit status, for managing cravi ngs and pre venting relapse. More often than not, the process of change may be quite difficult in actual practice. The following ways can be used to address the common questions asked by patients in tobacc o cessation counselling along with relevant response s: S.NO Questions Answers 1. I have been tobacco for many years without any health problems, plus my grandf ather smoked two packs a day and lived to be 90. So how does it matter? There are certainly p eople who smoke for many years without apparent tobacc o-related d iseases. But it's also true that about half the peopl e w ho smoke will die from a tobacco -related illness. It is also a fact that smokers live 6-10 years less than non- smokers. Some people are more sensitive to tobacco than others, and there is no single right answer that will fit everyone. please think if that is any reason to gamble with your health when you know that there is a 50% chance that you will die from a tobacco - related disease?\" 2. If I am going to die 10 years earlier, that's okay . If a non-smoker is likely to live till 80, then that means I'll live to be 70. I think that's fine. Since I am going to die anyway; I might as well have the pleasure of smoking till 70 and then die. I don't mind! \"You are absolutely right! Since we are all going to die someday, it's important to get what we want while we are still alive. But consider this: how we die is also important. Smoking is known to cause a slow, painful death due to rotting lung s brought on by years of smoking. It's not funny to watch someone die from a heart attack or some other life - threateni ng illness. It's a very painful thing for the victim, as well as for the loved ones. STE P 5: ARRANGE 75 3. Query: I only chew tobacco. Since I'm not emittin g smoke, I am not really harming my family or others. \"Maybe not, at least, not directly. But tobacco, whether chewed or smoked, is known to damage health. Chewed tobacco, for example, can cause deadly oral lesions, including cancer. Oral cancers progress rapidly, and can cause a very painful death. Please remem ber, chewed tobacco is NOT a safe alternative to smoked forms . So, while you may be protecting others from lung cancer due to second - hand smoke, you will be exposing them to other losses. The most im portant of such losses is the loss of your health and life, the love and support you can give to your family, and the contribution you can make to society.\" 4. I don't want to quit, but I would like to reduce tobacco use. In such cases, although total ces sation is the goal, any change is welcome. At least it will reduce harm and disability. Help the person set targets, s uch as cutting down on the number of cigarett es smoked, or the amount of tobacco chewed, in a day. Who knows, you might still be able to h elp the person quit totally in future. Take it one step at a tim e. 5. What happens if nothing works? Your patient just doesn't seem to care, and you feel you have reached a blank wall? It's okay! Just say \"I can understand you are not ready yet. If you decide you want some help in the future, or if you just want to talk to us, please call and fix an appointment. We would be glad to help you. Whether or not you decide to quit is a different matter altogether. But I have just given you some food for thought, so promise me that you will think along these lines. Table 6.10: Step 5 Arrange Strategy 76 MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING (MI) Motivational Interviewing intervention \u2014which can be delivered by dental healthcare providers, counselors, or Quitline coaches \u2014aims to help people explore and resolve any ambivale nce abo ut making a behavior change, such as quitting tobacco . Motivatio nal interviewing and its adaptations of this approach make use of a distinct style of Counselling that is directive, patient -centred, no n-confrontational, non -judgmental, and highl y col laborat ive. Motivational Interviewing as an approach is based on the understanding that: Effective treatment assists a natural process of change, Motivation for change occurs in the context of a relationship between the patient and the therapist, and The s tyle an d spirit of an intervention is important in how well it works, i n particular, an empathic style is associated with improved treatment outcomes The spirit of Motivational Interviewing is based on the following key pillars: Partnership Autonomy Compas sion Evocation Relevance of MI: It is especially useful when working with patients in the pre-contemplation and contemplation stages but the principles and skills are important at all stages. It is useful to be used for patients who are not willing to quit, are stuck or are not making any progress. It promotes the basic idea that people are more likely to respond to behaviour change when it is their idea and not something that is forced on them externally . START ING MOTIVA TIONAL INTERVIEWING Listen for Change Words They are indication of the patient's desire for change or a t least contemplating change CHANGE WORDS DESI RE: I want to ABILITY: I think, I can REASON: I will not have a healthy life NEED: My family needs me COMMITMEN T: makes a plan QUESTIONS TO ASK: Why do you want to do this? How do you think you will chang e your tobacco use? Why is this important? What steps can you take today? Professional Sights 77 PRINCIPLES OF MI: 1. Express empathy In the clinical sit uation empathy involves an accepting, non -judgemental approach whic h tries to understand the patient's point of view and avoids the use of labels such a 'tobacco addict'. It is especially important to avoid confrontation and blaming or criticis m of the pat ient. Skilful reflective listening which clarifies and amplifies the person's own experience and meaning is a fundamental part of expressing empathy. 2. Develop discrepancy People are more likely to be m otivated to change their tobacco use use beh aviou r when they see a difference or discrepancy between their current tobacco -use and related problems. MI aims to create and amplify a discrepancy between current behavior and broader goals and values from the patient's point of view. 3. Roll with resistanc e (avoid argument) A key principle of MI is to accept that ambivalence and resi stance to change is normal and to invite the patient to consider new information and perspectives on their tobacco use use. When the patient expresses resistance, the profession al should re frame it or reflect on it rather than opposing it. 4. Support self-efficacy (confidence) As discussed above patient s need to believe that reducing or stopping their tobacco use use is important and be c onfident that they are able to do so. Using negot iation and confidence building to persuade patients that there is something that they can do is an important part of motivational interviewing. SKILLS IN MI Motivational interviewing makes use of five speci fic skills. These skills are used together t o encourage patients to talk, to explore their ambivalence about their tobacco use and to clarify their reasons for reducing or stopping their tobacco use. The first four skills are often known by the acronym OARS - Open ended questions, Affirmation, Reflective lis tening, and Summarizing . The fifth skill is 'eliciting change talk' and involves using the OARS to guide the patient to present the arguments for changing their tobacco -use behaviour: Fig.6.13 Motivationa l Interviewing 78 OARS: The basic skills of Motivational Interviewing Descript ors ASK OPE N-ENDED QUESTIONS The patient does most of the talking. Gives the practitioner the opportunity to learn more about what the patient cares about (e.g., their values and goals). \"Are you concerned about your tobacco use?\" \"I understand you have s ome c oncerns about your tobacco use. Can you tell me about them?\" MAKE AFFIRMATIONS Can take the form of compliments or statements of appreciation and understanding. Helps build rapport and validate and support the patient during the process of change. Most effective when the patient's strengths and efforts for change are noticed and affirmed. \"I appreciate that it took a lot of courage for you to discuss your habit with me today.\" \"You appear to have a lot of resourcefulness to have coped with these difficulties for the past few years.\" \"Thank you for hanging in there with me. I appreciate this is not easy for you to hear.\" USE REFLECTIONS Involves rephrasing a statement to capture the implicit meaning and feeling of a patient's statement. Encourages continua l perso nal exploration and helps people understand their motivations more fully. Can be used to amplify or reinfo rce desire for change. \"You enjoy the effects of tobacco in terms of how it helps you unwind a fter a stressful day at work and helps you intera ct with friends without being too self-conscious.\" \"But you are begi nning to worry about the impact tobacco is ha ving on your health.\" \"In fact, until recently you weren't too worried about how much tobacco you use because you thought you had it under control.\" 79 \"Then you found out your health has been affected and your f amily members and friends said a few things t hat have made you doubt that tobacco is helping you at all.\" USE SUMMARISING Links discussion s and 'checks in' with the patient. Ensure m utual unders tanding of the discussion so far. Point out discrepancies between the person's current situation and futur e goals. Demonstrates listening and understand the patient's perspective. \"If it is okay with you, just let me check that I understand eve rythi ng that we've been discussing so far.\" \"You have been worrying about how much tobacco you've been using in recent months because you recognise that you have experienced some health issues associated with your tobacco intake, and you've had some feedba ck from your family that they aren't happy with the tobacco habit.\" \"But the few times you've tried to stop it have not been easy, and you are worried that you can't stop.\" Table 6.11 Basic Skills of Motivationa l Interviewing CONCLUSION Behavioural inter venti ons in tobacco cessation vary widely in their content, delivery and availability. The skills that every counsello r should possess include; communication skills, listening and attending skills, focusing and p araphrasing, validating and encouraging in a non-judgmen tal manner. The same skills should be used by dental healthca re professionals in providing effective tobac co cessation counselling to tobacco -users. Behavioural Interventions can be divided into two t ypes: very brief and brief interventions dep endin g upon the time available for delivery by the professional. The evid ence- based interventions include the 5A's an d 5R's approach, delivered systematically in a step -by-step manner. Motivational interviewing \u2014which can be delivered by dentists, healthca re providers , counsellors, or Quitline coaches \u2014aims to help people explor e and resolve any ambivalence about making a behaviour change, such as quitting tobacco -use. 80 KEY TAKEAWAY Brief interventions in denta l clinical settings can range from 5 minutes of brief advice to 15- 30 minutes of brief counselling It has been shown th at nurses and healthcare workers have been ef fective in tobacco cessation in cases where simple advice, administered alone, has produced quit rates of 5%- 10% per year The various Br ief interven tions that have been found to be evidence -based include 5A's (Ask, Advice, Assess, Assist, Arrange) , 5R's ( Relevance, Risks, Rewards, Roadblocks, Repetition) and comprehensive approach called FRAMES (Feedback, Responsibility, Advice, Menu of Option s, Empa thy & Self -efficacy) Motivational interviewing is an evidence -based approach which can be used along with 5R's to work with non-resistant patients Effective strategies implemented by dental and other healthcare professionals in a standard manne r can promot e effective outcomes in terms of tobacco cessation. CASE - STU DY ON APPLICATION OF BRIEF INTERVENTIONS FOR TOBACCO CESSATION Patient Mr. H, 42 -year-old male, Hindu, educated up to 10th Standard, working as an auto -rickshaw driver cam e to the hos pital OPD with complaints of bleeding gums. At the OPD screening, he was identified as a chronic tobacco -user, consumi ng 15-20 beedi's in a day and was referred to the Tobacco Cessation Clinic for man agement. Following are the details of the co nsult ation: FIRST VISIT (Time duration: 15-30 mins.) Patient was identified as a toba cco user by initiating the 5A's approach \" ASK \". Patient received behavioral counseling at the TCC in the form of Brief Behavio ral Intervention, along with follow -up visits which were planned along with his Dental treatment. At the first point of contact, the dental professional welcomed the patient, he was made to feel comfortable, and rapport was established. Patient was strongl y ADVISED to discontinue tobacco -use and a clear message was given His willingness to quit was ASSESSED by asking him \"Do you want to quit?\" His position on the Stages of Chan ge model was identified, he was in the PREPARATION stage, which means that he desired to quit in the next 30 days and had a 24-hour quit attempt in the past. He was also assessed on FTND on which he received a s core 6, indicating medium severity of depende nce. 81 Detailed Interview was conducted with the patient using the TCC Performa and the details of tobacco -use, from quantity, durat ion, types was established. Patient was educated regarding the benefits of quitti ng and using motivational interviewing style, he was encouraged to discontinue use. The following Monday was set as his QUIT -DATE and he was told to generate social suppo rt to become abstinent. He was asked to maintain his tobacco -use diary and record his usage, cues and triggers. He was also provide d guidance to manage the same. Next visit was planned after a few days from the quit date. SECOND VISIT ( 15-20 mins.) The patien t came for follow -up. He has quit smoking completely along he reported having unbea rable cravings and headaches. He was praised and reinforced positively for his successful attempt. Patient was educated abou t the withdrawal symptoms of Tobacco -use along with mana ging high-risk situations that can lead to relapse. He was also educated usi ng the 4D's approach (Delay, Distract, Drink Water, Deep breathing) and was asked to practice these strategies. Follow -up would be conducted after 2 weeks Mention follo w-up strateg y. If patients cannot follow -up physically, the follow -up can be done teleph onically. 82 ASSESSMENT I.

To enco urage tobacco cessation, pharmacotherapy, or use of approved drugs, has been widely acc epted as an effective mechanism. It helps in reducing the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and aids in cessation. The use of pharmacotherapy in treating tobacco dependenc e has been shown to double or even triple the cessation rates. A pharmacological treatm ent for tobacco cessation acts in dual ways: blocking the positive reinfo rcing effect of nicotine & preventing the development of withdrawal symptoms. Experienc e of toba cco cessation clinics in India in over 30,000 patients (predominantly smokeless users) adds to the evidence that adding pharma cotherapy improves the likelihood of tobacco cessation. Even with establishe d evidence of its potential, there are a few recognize d barriers that impede the use of pharmacothe rapy in the Indian scenario: 1. Limited avail ability 2. Limited knowledge 3. Little experi ence with using pharmacotherapy 4. Therapeut Tobacco user's hesitation to accep t pharmacotherapy. LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the professionals should be able to understand the Need and scope of pharmacotherapy in tobacco u se cessa tion in de ntal settings Types of pharmacother apeutic agents available Indications, contraindications and side effects of various pharmaco therapeutic agen ts 7.

Smokers with cardio vascular or pulmonary disease : Care should be exercised w ith use of nicotine with patients who have had a recent myocar dial infarction, experience severe or worsening angina, or have erapy are initially preferre d. Indications for Pharmaco therapy All persons with severe dependence i.e., a score of more than 6 on the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Depende nce Scale Past history of multiple failure s without pharmacotherapy Tobacco users who a re unable to abstain with behavioral intervention alone. Using tobacco within the first 30 minut es of waking up Using tobacco pr oduct/s for more than 10 times in 24 hour s or uses tobacco while bed -ridden or suff ering from a life -threatening illness such as MI, Canc er, COPD, etc. (Note: The above -mentioned indications can be correlated with clinical conditions of the patient before prescribing pharmacotherapy) Various Drugs Used Under Pharmacotherapy for Tobacco Cessation Drugs commonly used for tobacco cessation are categorized under First-line drugs and Second-line drugs. Three drugs are currently marketed as first line pharmac otherapy: 1. 3. Varenicline tartrate. First-line treatmen ts have been shown to safe for tobacco cessatio n. Clon idine and nor-triptyline are included as sec ond line pharmacotherapies. Choice of pharmac otherapy should take into account evidence, patient pr eference, patient experience, patient need s, potential adverse effects as well as benefits. Considering many side effects associated with second line pharmac otherapies, it is advantageous to prescribe first line of pharmacotherapies. 85 1. Nicotine pray) The general principle of replacement therapies is to present the patient with a safer and more therapeut ically manageable form of the drug that direc tly alleviates the signs and symptoms of withdrawal and craving. NR T delivers plasma nicotine concent rations that are lower than those in conventional cigare ttes and thereby reducing the behaviourally reinforcin g effect of smoking. NRTs increase the rate of long-term quitting by 50%-70% regardless of the type of behaviora l therapy. NRT users were twice as likely to remain off tobacco compared to NRT non -users four years after treatment. Commonly, NRTs ar e availab le in six forms, used worldwide. All forms of NRT appear to be equally effective; some are even sold as over -the-counter drugs: I. Nicotine chewing gums (short acting) II. Nicotine skin patches (long acting) III. Nicotine lozenges and sublingual tablets (shor t acting) IV. Nicotine inhalers (short acting) V. Nicotine nasal spray (short acting) Currently Nicotin e chewing gums, Nicoti ne Skin patches and Nicotine Lozen ges are available in India and are described in detail in t his chapter. Although the dosage varies clini cally dep ending upon the dependence and requirement of patients, however the present manual has divided dosage on the basis of no. of cigarettes/bids pe r day a nd on the time to first cigarette of the day. I. NICOTI NE CHEWI NG GUM : This is the commonest form of NRT av ailable in India. The principal component of Nicotine Gum is Nicotine Polacrilex. It acts as an oral substitute and provides a constant source of nicotine. The gum is available in different strengths (2mg and 4mg) and can be used either at regular interval s or on an as needed basis. Dosage: For patie nts who smoke around 1 -24 cpd/bpd OR smokes 1st c igarette >30 minut es after waking - 2mg is prescrib ed up to 12 weeks. For patients who smoke >25 cpd/bpd OR smokes 1st cigarette 30 minutes after wakin g -4 mg is prescribed up to 12 weeks. Chewers need about half or a quarter of the dose as prescribed for smokers. (Note: A user can consume up to a maximu m of 24 pieces/day) Fig. 7.1: Nicotine Gums 86 Weeks 1-6: 1 piece every 1-2 hours Weeks 7-9: 1 piece every 2-4 hours Weeks 10-12: 1 piece , every 4-8 hours Fig. 7.2 : Dosage of Nicotine Gums (Adapte d from: National Tobacco Control Programme, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Training manual for Doctors, 2011 ) Usage Method Stop all tobacco products once the nicotine gum is sta rted. The correct use of the gum is to use the \"chew and park\" method. The gum should be chewed until a \"peppery\" or \"flavored\" taste emerges, then park it between the cheek and gum to let the nicotine absorb. When the user can no longer taste the p eppery or flavored taste, chewing should ensue once again . The \"che w and park\" method usually lasts until the taste leaves, which is estimated to take about 30 minutes. Considerations while using Nicotine gum s Don't chew nicotine gum too fast. Don't chew more than one piece of gum at a time. Don't chew one piece too soon after another. Don't chew more than 24 pieces of gum in a day Avoid eating and drinking (especially acidic beverages such as coffee or soft drinks) during and for at least 15-30 minutes after chewing of nicotine gum to prevent reduced absorption of nicotin e. The use of nicotine gum is to be titrated by the patients as per their needs but they may begin reducing the use after a fortnight to a mo nth and stop altogether after 3 months. Rarely, succes sful quitters require it for longer duration.

NICOTINE GUMS ADVANTAGES DISADVANTAGES Might serve as an oral substitute for tobacco Might delay weight gain Can be titrate d to manage withdrawal symptoms Can be used in combination with other agents to manage situational urges Need for frequent dosing can compromise adherence Might be problematic for patients with significant dental work Proper chewing technique is necessary for effectiveness and to minimize adverse effects Gum chewing might not be acceptable or desirable for some patients Table 7.1: Nicotine Gums - Advantages & Disadvantages II. NICOTINE PATCH These are simple to use and are reported with better complianc e rates tha n other NRT products. However, they deliver nicotine more slowly and may not adequately protect against craving. Usage Method The patch is applied once daily to a clean, dry, hairless area. For some persons, wearing the patch at night can disturb sleep an d cause viv id dreams. In such cases the day patch is more suitable. The most common side effects of the patch are a skin rash were applied and sleep disturbance.

NICOTINE LOZENGES These are dissolved under the tongu e. They come in two strengths: a 2-mg and 4-mg dose lozenge. They are easy to use and facilitate rapid nicot ine absorption. Dosage: For patients who smoke around 1-25 cpd/bpd OR smokes 1st cigarette >30 minutes after waking - 2mg is prescribed upto 12 week s For patients who smoke >25 cpd/bpd OR smokes 1st cigarette 30 minutes after waking -4 mg is prescribed upto 12 weeks (Taper as tolerated) Maximum 20 lozenges/day, Duration: up to 12 weeks, Chewers need about half or a quarter of the dose as prescribe d for smokers 90 Week 1 -6: 01 lozenge every 1-2 hours Week 7 -9: 01 lozenge every 2 -4 hours Week 10-12: 01 lozenge every 4 -8 hours Fig. 7.5 Dosage of Nicotine Lonzenges Precautions Recent (2 weeks) myocardial infarction Serious underlying arrhythmias Serious or worsening angina pectoris Pregnancy and breastfeeding Adolescents (<18 years of age) Effect Heartburn, Headache, Flatulence, Insomni a NICOTINE LOZENGES ADVANTAGES DISADVANTAGES Might serve as an oral substitute for tobacco Might delay weight gain Can be titrated to manage withdrawal symptoms Can be used in combination with other agents to manage situational urges Need for frequent dosing can compromise adherence Gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, hiccups, heartburn) might be bothersome Table 7.3: Nicotine Lozenges - Advantages & Disadvantages Fig. 7. 6 Nicotine Lozenge 91 150 m g (BD) Days(1 -3) Days (4-7) 150 mg (OD) Weeks (2 - 12) 150 mg (BD) BUPROPION Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant non-nicotine d rug for treating tobacco dependence commonly marketed as sustained release Bupropion Hydrochloride tablets. Mechanism of Action: Its action is likely mediated through the noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic pathways. Dosage: A quit date is dec ided preferably within 7 to 14 d ays of starting treatment with bupropion. This is because the steady state plasma concentration of bupropion and its active metabolites are achieved in approximately 8 days after initiation of therapy . Begin therapy 1 week prior to quit date Days 1-3: 150 mg OD every morning Days 4-7: 150mg BD Weeks 2-12: 150mg BD after discontinuing smoking (i.e 11 weeks) Note : Do not exceed 300 mg/day Allow at least 8 hours between doses Avoid bedtime dosing to minimize insomnia Dose tapering is not necessary ( May stop ab ruptly) Duration: 7-12 weeks, with maintenance up to 6 months in selected patients Fig. 7.8 Dosage of Bupropion Fig. 7.7 Usag e Method of Bupropion 92 Precautions Concomitant therapy with medications/ conditions known to lower the seizur e threshold Pregnancy (category C) and breastfe eding Adolescents (<18 years of age) Treatment -emergent neuropsychiatric symptoms: Boxed warning removed December 2016 Adverse Effect Insomnia, Dry mouth, Nervousness/ difficulty concentrating, Nausea, Dizzin ess, Constipation, Ra sh, Seizures (risk is 0.1% ), Neuropsychiatric symptoms (rare) BUPROPION ADVANTAGES DISADVANTAGES Twice -daily oral dosing is simple and associated with fewer adherence problems Might delay weight gain Might be beneficial in patie nts with depression Can be used in combination with NRT agents Seizure risk is increased Several contraindications and precautions preclude use in some patients Patients should be monitored for potential neuropsychiatric symptoms Table 7.4 : Bupropion - Advantages & Disadvantages 93 VARENICLINE Varenicline is derived from cystine with an active ingredient as varenicline tartarate. Fig. 7.9 Varenicline Tablet Mechanism of Action Varenicline is a nicotinic receptor partial agonist (i.e., it binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors), which mainta ins moderate levels of dopamine to reduce withdrawal symptoms and the urge to smoke. It also acts as an antagonist by blocking nico tine binding to spec ific receptors, which may reduce the rewarding effects of smoking and reduce reactivity to smoking cues. Dosage Tobacco use may be stopped one week after initiating treatment with Varenicline. The recommended duration of treatment is 12 weeks. In pe rsons with a high risk of relapse, tapering the dose while stopping is recommended. Begin therapy 1 week prior to quit date and total duration should be 12 weeks. Dose tapering is not necessary (May stop abruptly). May reduce smoking over a 12-week period of treatment prior to quitting and continue treatment for an additional 12 weeks Precautions Severe renal impai rment (dosage adjustment is necessary) Pregnancy and breastfeeding Days 4-7 0.5 mg BD Days 1-3 0.5 mg OD every morning Wee ks 2-12 1 mg BD (i.e 11 weeks) Fig. 7.10 Dosage of Varen icline 94 Adolescents (<18 years of age) Patient with history of neuro -psychiatry illnesses and suic idal tendency Adverse Effect Nausea Sleep disturbances (insomnia, abnormal/ vivid dreams) Constipat ion Flatulence Vomiting Neuropsychiatric symptoms (rare) VARENICLINE ADVANTAGES DISADVANTAGES Twice-daily oral dosing is simple and associated with fewer a dherence problems Offers a different mechanism of action for patients who have failed other agents Should be taken with food or a full glass of water to reduce the incidence of nau sea Patients should be monitored for potential neuropsychiatric symptoms Table 7.5: Varenicline - Advantages & Disadvantages Drug Combinations Combining approved medications is one approach to potentially improving cessation outcomes. There is robust evidence that combi ning medications had superior results when compared to single medic ation. Combination of pharmacotherapy should be based on patients' failed attempt with monothe rapy, level of dependence, multiple failed attempts and experiencing nicotine withdr awal etc. Comb ining Therapy Combined behavioral and pharmacological therapies appear to be the best approach for treating tobacco dependence. Because these therapies operat e by different mechanisms, complementary and potentially additive effects may be ex pected. NR T therapy combined with supportive counseling is the most widely used and intensively reached treatment modality. Although self-help strategies alone marginally affect quit rates, individual and combined pharmacotherapies and counseling either alone or in combination can significantly increase cessation. 95 Monitoring and follow-up All patients taking pharmacotherapy should be monitored carefully. The frequency of mon itoring should be determined by: 1. Patient need The top priority for frequency of moni toring should be determined by patient needs. For example, patients with multi ple or difficult quit attempts will likely require more support. 2. Type of pharmacotherapy Some types of pharmacotherapies may require more frequent monitoring, particularly if the re is potential for adverse events (for example, drug interaction, side effect s) Success story in India: In India tobacco cessation services were formally initiated in 2002 by the World Health Organization's Country Office and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, through tobacco cessation clinics. Thirteen clinics were initially started in cancer, cardiology, respiratory, surgical, psychiatry and N GO settings and subsequently expanded. The experience with treating more than 34,000 tobacco users, primarily smokeless users (65%) showed that behavioral forms o f intervention, which included health education, simple tips for quitting and counseling to im prove motivation and prevent relapse, produced good results. Of those who maintained follow-up, nearly one-third had been abstinent at the six-week follow -up and nearly half had reduced tobacco consumption by 50% or more. Less than a third of treatment seekers had received pharmacotherapy and those who received combined pharmacotherapy and counseling did significantly better than those receiving only counseling. CONCLUSION The general principle of replacement therapies is to present the patient with a safer and more therapeutically manageable form of the drug that directly alleviates the s igns and symptoms of withdrawal and craving. NRT delivers nicotine to address physical nicotine dependence without exposing the person who is trying to quit to the toxic constituents generated by combustion or other aadditives . NRT delivers plasma nicotine concentrations that are lower than those in conventional cigarettes and that rise more slowly, thereby reducing the behaviorally reinforcing effect of smoking. 96 ALGO RITHM S elby P. An algorithm for tailoring pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation results from a Delphi Panel of International Experts ) 97 KEY TAKEAWAY NRT is very safe and should be offered to all in proper dose and duration Pharmacotherapy for tobacco dependence treatment is safe and effective and significantly increases the chance for long -term smoking abstinence compared with quit attempts unaided by pharmacotherapy Interventions that combine pharmaco therapy and behavioral support increase tobacco cessation success rates compared to single intervention. Combination of multiple form of NRT (long duration i.e., patch) with short durat ion (gum/spray) increases smoking abstinence Varenicline is the most ef fective agent for tobacco cessation (one and half time more than bupropion and twice more than NRTs) but must be regularly monitored for any neuropsychiatric adverse effects. NRT may be considered in pre gnan cy if the patient is unable to quit without medic ation, but only after the risks and benefits have been carefully explained.

All tobacco users trying to quit except in the presence of special circumstances. Special consideration should be given before using pharmacotherapy with selected populations: those with medic al contraindications, those smoking less tha n 10 cigarettes/day, pregnant, and adolescent smokers. What are the first-line pharma - cotherapies recommended in this guideline? Nicotine gum, Nicotine patch and Nicotine Lozen ges What factors should a clinician consider when choosing among the first- line pharmacotherapies? Because of the lack of sufficient data to rank -order these medications, choice of a specific first -line pharmacotherapy must be guided by factors such as clinicia n fa miliarity with the medications, contrain dications for selected patients, patient preference, previous patient experience with a specific pharmacotherapy (positive or negative), and patient characteristics (e.g., history of de pression, concerns about weight gain). Are pharmacotherapeutic treatme nt appropriate for lighter smokers (e.g., 10 - 15 cigarettes/day)? Pharmacotherapy when used should be given with the basic principle of \"Right Drugs in Right Doses at Right Times\". Toba cco dependence shoul d not b e treated any differently. What second -line pharmacotherapies are recommended in this guideline? Clonidine and nortriptyline. When should second -line agents be used for treating tobacco dependence? Consider prescribing second -line agents for patie nts unable to use first-line medications because of contraindications or for patients for whom first-line medications are not helpful. Monitor patients for the known side effects of second -line agents. Which pharmacotherapi es should be conside red with patients particularly concerned about weig ht gain? Bupropion SR and nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), in particular nicotine gum, have been shown to delay, but not prevent, weight gain. 100 Which pharmacotherapies should be considered with patient s with a history of depression? Bupropion SR and nortriptyline appear to be effective with this population. Should nicotine replacement therapies be avoided in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease? No. Nicotine replaceme nt therapies a re safe and have not been shown to cause adverse cardiova scular effects. However, the safety of these products has not been established for the immediate post -MI period or in patients with severe or unstable angina. May tobacco dependence pharmacotherapie s be use d long- term (e.g., 6 months or more)? Yes. This approach may be helpful with smokers who report persistent withdrawal symptoms during the course of pharmacotherapy or who desire long -term therapy. A minority of individuals who succe ssfully quit s moking use a d libitum NRP medications (gum, nasal spray, inhaler) long -term. The use of these medications long - term does not present a known health risk. Additionally, the use of bupropion SR for a long -term maintenance indication may be eva luated in some cases . May nicotine replacement pharmacotherapies ever be combined? Yes. There is evidence that combining the nicotine patch with either nicotine gum or nicotine lozenge increase long-term abstinence rates over those produced by a single form of NRT.

Nicotine Gums Dose Quantity Duration 103 INTRODUCTION Tobacco dependence is characteri stically a chr onic and relapsing disease. Maintenance of tobacco use is largely due to nicotine, which is the main addictive component found in tobacco. When tobacco - users discontin ue use, an unpleasant withdrawal syndrome occurs in dependent individuals. Additionally, addiction to tobacco use depends not only on the positive reinforcing and hedonic actions of ni cotine, but also on escape from the aversive consequences of nicotine wi thdrawal. Research has indicated that avoida nce of the negative emotional state produced by nicotine withdrawal represents a motivational component that promotes continued tobacco use and relapse after smoking cessation. The nicotine withdrawal syndrome is considered to be one of the major causes of high relapse rate in individu als undergoing smoking cessation (Le Foll and Goldberg 2009). NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME Smoking cessation a fter chronic tobacco use produces a well characterized and defined withd rawal syndrome. The nicotine withdrawal syn drome in abstinent tobacco -users consists of 'physical' or somatic components, cognitive, and 'affective' components. The tobacco users exper ience and increase in blood nicotine levels after every use, which stay for a short duration of time and then drop. When nicotine level in the bl ood falls, the brain triggers \"alarm bells\" that compel the individual to use tobacco again. The unpleasant symptoms that occur when a person suddenly stops use of any psychoactive drug are known as withdrawal symptoms . LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the pro fessionals should be able to unders tand the Nature and mech anism of the Nicotine Withdrawal Syndrome Various techniques to deal with withdrawal symptoms Meaning of relapse, lapse and various triggers for relapse Prevention and relapse through various strategies 8. UNDERSTANDING WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS AND RELAPSE MANAGEMENT 8 0 104 Nicot ine withdrawal symptoms occur within a few h ours of stopping tobacco use, are maximum during the first week and usually last two to four week s. Along with the 7 primary symptoms mentioned by DSM -5 (refer to the ta ble below), The syndrome might also include constipation, dizziness, nightmares, nausea , and sore throat. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -5) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ) Irritability/Anger/Frustration & Anxiety Depres sed Mood Difficulty Concentrating Increased Appetite Insomnia Restlessness Fig. 8.1: For practical understanding the withdrawal symptoms can be classified into three categories 105 COMMON WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS AND WAYS TO COPE WITH THEM S.NO Withdrawal Symptoms Manifestation Timeline of Presentation Managem ent Strategy 1. Craving for tobacco Body's craving for nicotine Most i ntense during first week but can linger for months Wait out the urge; distrac t yourself; take a brisk walk 2. Irritabili ty, Impatience Body's craving for nicotine 2-4 weeks Exercise, take hot bath, use relaxation techniques, avoid caffeine 3. Insomnia Body's craving for nicotine 2-4 weeks Avoid caffeine after 6 p.m.; use relaxati on techniques; exercise 4. Fatigue Body adjusting to lack of stimulation from nicotine 2-4 weeks Take naps; do not push yourself 5. Lack of concentration Body adjusting to lack of stimulation from nicotine A few weeks Reduce workload; avoid stress 6. Hunger Craving for cigarette may be confused with hunger pangs Up to several weeks Drink water or low- calori e drinks; eat low calorie snacks 7. Coughing, Dry throat, nasal drip Body ridding itself of mucus in lungs and airways Several weeks Drink plenty of fluids; use cough drops 8. Constipation, Indigestion, Gas Intestine movement decreases with lack of nicot ine 1-2 weeks Drink plenty of fluids; add fiber to diet; exercise Table 8.1: Common Withdrawal Symptoms and Coping Mechanism 106 STEP -BY-STEP APPROACH FOR MANAGING WITHDRAW AL SYMPTOMS Withdrawal symptoms vary from every tobacco -user to user and hence it is e ssential to identify client specific withdrawal symptoms and manage them accordingly. Every tobacco -user who desires to quit experience phy sical as well as psychological withdrawal sy mptoms and to counter these, a wide array of techniques can be used in a step-by-step manner. 1. Identify and assess the nature of withdrawal sympto ms (e.g., increased cravings, dry mouth, digestive issues etc.) 2. Identify the possible triggers, s pecific time/a ctivities associated with cravings/withdrawal symptoms 3. Manage stressors and triggers (For e.g., avoiding interaction with peers or social influen ces that make abstinence difficult, managing the intake of tea if it is associated with smoking behaviour , keeping healthy food items as an alternative to chewing tobacco) 4. Emphasize an d demonstrate the 7 D's strategy (Delay, Distract, Drink water , Deep Breathing and Discuss with family & friends to take the required soci al support. Additional \"D\" oft en suggests \"Drugs & Diet\" which mean pharmacotherapy and healthy diet at right times. 5. Practice yoga, meditation and relaxation exercises to manage stress. 6. Lifestyle modification is an essential to manage withdrawal symptoms, which includes having a stabl e and consiste nt sleeping pattern, avoid alcohol consumption and consume a healthy and balanced diet. 7. Not all quitters get all symptoms, mostly these are self -limiting and manageable with symptomatic treatment only. And, lastl y, these are not life -threaten ing. 107 RELAPSE PREVENTION Tobacco users have risk of relapse when they are expe riencing situations of wither extreme joy (celebrations, festivals, prom otion in job, new arrival in the family, meeting an old fri end with whom s/he was using tobacco, etc.) or extreme grief (loss in business, attrition from job, death in the family, isolation, etc.). Relapse prevention could be due to internal or external tr iggers, which can be referred to as high -risk stimuli (HRS) (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985). Th ese triggers of ten activate the tobacco -use related belief which can lead to cravings/urges and eventually lead to lapse. INTERNAL TRIGGERS EXTERNAL TRIGGERS Emotiona l factors like, stress, depression, loneliness, anger, frust ration, disappointments and p hysical pain These can be related to situations, places and things related to drug use in some way Table 8.2 Relapse Prevention - Internal Triggers & External Trigger s Hence, it is important to identify the possible HIGH -RISK SITUATIONS/STIMULI. This can be done throug h troubleshooting dialogue between the counselor and the patient: What type of situations remind you of the feeling of wanting tobacco? Let's try to recall the last time you had the urge to use tobacco How do yo u feel when you have a specif ic urge? When do you experience the urge the most? Why is it difficult for you to control in a specific situation? 108 STEP -1 Identify High Risk Situations/Stimuli for the Tobacc o-user (For e.g., seeing someone using tobacco, interacting with tobacco -users or tea breaks) STEP -2 Examine Negative Ideas Related to Tobacco -use (For e.g \"If I don't use tobacco, I will not be able to drive for long hours. ............... I will not be able to concentr ate on my job\") STEP -3 Rehearse or Practice Strategies for Coping with High Risk Situations (For example, resolving conflict with family member, engagi ng in yoga or some recreational tasks to manage stress. Discuss with your dental healthcare provider Change at the thinking level Change in behaviour/ lifestyle Return to tobacco -use Fig. 8.2: Thr ee distinct stages indicating the onset of a relapse Fig. 8.3: Steps To Follow For Relapse Prevention And Its Management Previously stated changes will definitely lead the person back to tobac co use. Since relapse occu rs in these stages, it is possible to recognize and arrest the process at any stage. The key point here is: relapse is preventable if identified and treated early. Person starts relati ng again to the set of tobacco-user peers, places and activities w hich centre around tobacco use. Include meeting with such people; a sense of overconf idence that relapse will never occur. Recovered person gets back to old thought patterns; for example, starts thinking constantly about smo king a beed i/ chewing tobac co, and if it's possible to just take \"one puff\" or \"one chew/dip\". 109 RELAPSE PREVENTION TECHNIQUES TO BE USED Tobacco dependence has a chronic relapsing nature, dent al professionals should provi de brief effect ive relapse prevention treatment. It is essential to reinforce the person's decision to quit, review the benefits of quitting, and assist in resolving any residual problems arising from quitting. Although most re lapses occur early in the qui tting process, some relapse might occur after a few months or even years after the quit date. Therefore, dental professionals mu st engage in relapse prevention interventions even with former tobacco users who no longer consider themselves actively engaged in the quitting process. Relapse prevention interventions are especially important after quitting and can be delivered by means of scheduled dental clinic visits, telephone calls, or at any time the d ental professional encount ers an ex-tobacco use in a pa tient. A system atic, institutionalized mechanism to identify recent quitters and contact them is essential to deliver relapse prevention intervention effectively. S.NO PROBLEMS RESPONSES 1. Strong or prolonged withdrawal symp toms Consider extending the use of an approv ed pharmacotherapy or adjuncts to reduce strong withdrawal symptoms. 2. Negative mood or depression Provide suppor t, prescribe appropriate medications, or refer individual to a specialis t. 3. Lack of support fo r cessation Help the person t o identify sour ces of support within his or her environment. Refer the person to an appropriate organization that offers cessation counselling or support. 4. Flagging motivation/ feeling deprived Reass ure the person that th ese feelings are common. Reco mmend rewarding activities. Emphasize that beginning to smoke (even a puff) will increase urges and make quitting more difficult. 5. Weight gain Reassure the person that some weight gain after quitting is common and appears to be self -limiting. Emphasize the importance of a healthy diet and healthy lifestyle. Table 8.3: Relapse Prevention - Problems & Responses PROFESS IONAL IN SIGHT The ACE MODEL A: AVOID risky situations when pos sible. When avoiding a risky situation is not possible: C: COPE using a variety of behavioural, pharmacological and cognitive strategies. If coping is not working E: ESCAPE the situation by leaving. *This relapse prevent ion strategy is useful for recently quit users as it provides them with a clearly defined set of actions to manage situa tions that ma y lead them back to active tobacco use. 110 If the patient lapses, it is important to acknowledge and realize that a lapse has happened : The tobacco user must acknowledge that they have slipped. That does not mean that they are not tobacco dependent again. The dental professional must help the patient in remembering the positive quit time the patient had. Additionally, the focus should be on strengthening the co ping skills. The following ways can be helpf ul: a) Understand the reason behind the slip : Identify the trigger (Ask relevant questions; understand exactly what was it that made you smoke/use tobacco? On the day of the lapse, what exactly happened? What warnin g signs were present - experi encing anger, i rritability or stress?) b) Make a note of the learning experience : The tobacco -user must note the positive ways that helpe d them from refraining tobacco -use. Seek help immediately or talk to you r family or friends. Follow through with the plan that the patie nt had made along with the dental professional initially when starting treatment. c) Do not discontinue medication without consulting the professional : It is essential that the prescribed medicat ion is tapered as per the physician's advice, otherwise it could lead to relapse among tobacco -users . KEY TAKEAWAY Maintenance of tobacco use is largely due to nicotine, which is the main addictive component found in to bacco Relapse prevention could be due to internal or external triggers, which can be referred to as high-risk stimuli (HRS). High risk situations can be identified by using a identifying the trigger -and assessing dialogue between the patient and the counse lor. Relapse prevention interventio ns are especially important soon after quitting and can be delivered by means of scheduled clinic visits, telephone calls, or any time the clinician encounters an ex-tobacc o user. 111 ASSESSMENTS Q.1 What are the three broad categories of withdrawal symp toms experienced by tobacco users? a) Cognitive, Social, Cultural b) Cognitive , Affective, Physical c) Cognitive, Emotional, Social d) Cognitive, Physical, Emotional Q.2 Which of the following symptoms are NOT part of the Nicotine Withdrawal Syndrome? a) Fatigue b) Craving s c) Disturbed Sleep and Appetite d) Delirium Q.3 Which of the following are the 4D's? a) Delay, Distract, Decline, Deep Sleep b) Delay, Distract, Drink Water, Deep Breathing c) Delay, Decline, Discuss, Deviate d) Delay, Discuss, Drink Water, Decline Q.4 What is the most common re ason for not quitting for Tobacco users? a) It allows them to sleep better b) They enjoy it too much c) The craving is too strong d) It is a good substitute to chewing gum while feeling bored Q.5 How can one prevent a lapse from becoming a relapse? a) Realize that one has slip and reach out to the profe ssional for guidance and supp ort b) Realize that one has slipped, then inducing guilt and continuing to stay in the stressful environment c) Realize that one has slip and ignore the incident altogether d) Realize that one has slip and continue the behavior till the y see some consequences 112 ACTIVITY -I CASE S TUDY DEMONSTRATING TOBACCO CESSATION COUNSELLING FOR RELAPSE MANAGEMENT Patient came to the Dental Clinic/Dental hospital OPD with a relapse of tobacco sm oking. He is a 33 - year-old, male, currently working in the IT sector. He had a history of smoking 15 -20 cigarettes per day. After seeking counselling at the dental clinic, he had been abstinent since the last 2 years. However, due to persistent stress at work he started smoking 6 months ag o. During the follow -up session, the patien t reported that since the lockdown started, he has been working from home and that has led to additional work pressure. The patient also reported that he has been having difficul ty in managing work and personal life. He has difficulty workin g for long hours. He usually experiences the urge to smoke when there are some deadlines to meet and job demands become overwhelming. DETAILS OF THE INTERVENTION Behavioral Counseling for Relap se Prevention After assessing the details of the patient's current use/durati on/frequency/triggers and stressors, FTND was applied, the client obtained a score of 5 indicating moderate dependence. The stressors and triggers reported by the patient were add ressed in the counseling session. The patient was currently i n the preparatio n stage Quit date was set to 1 week from the day of the consultation, along with the same other interventions used to manage stressors. The patient was educated using the 4D's app roac h (Delay, Distract, Drink Wa ter, Deep breathing and discussing with friends and family) to manage urges and cravings. The patient was also educated using motivational interviewing emphasizing self -efficacy for the patient who is capable of remaining ab stinen To address the difficulty faced by patient in managin g work -life, he was asked to follow activity scheduling in which he was asked to engage in recreational tasks and separate family time from work responsibilities Patient was also advised to engage in some physical exercise like brisk walking and yoga to promote better ove rall health. Follow -up to be done after 2 days from the quit date, which could be done with the dental professional in -person or through telephonic consultation. (As per the need a nd comfort of the patient, text message reminders were also sent 2 -4 times a day in a structured manner.) 113 INTRODUCTION The quit line has been recommended as one of the population -wide approaches to support tobacco users in quittin g by the guidelin es for implementation of Article 14 of the WHO Framework Convent ion on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). Tobacco Quitline Services have the potential to reach a large numb er of tobacco users with the sole objective to provide telephone -based, in formation, advice , support, and referrals for tobacco cessation and is available free in most developed countries. India too now joins the international tobacco cessation movement with its own National level Tobacco Quitline Services (NTQLs) (1800 -11-2356) History of NTQL s in India 1980's - Testing of Quitline was started in early 1980s in Europe and the United States. 1985 - Quit Victoria, the first tobacco quit line set up by the A ustralian government in 1985. 1988 -After the good response of Quit Victor ia second tobacco quitline U.K Quit set up by the U.K government in 1988 2009 - Americ an Cancer Society (the ACS) Quitline for Indian Workplaces was launched in WCTOH held at Mumbai. 2011 - 2013 - Population Services International (PSI) India Quitline based out of Chen nai established through technical support of ACS. LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the professionals should be able to understand the Functioning of Quitline services in India The biomarkers used in laboratory investigations for tobacco cessatio n in dental clinical settings 9. TECHNOLOGY INTERVENTIONS AND LA BORATORY INVESTIGATION I N TOBACCO CESSATION 9 0 114 2012 - Nicorette started a helpline at Mumbai on 31st May 2012 to provide information/techniques to help tobacco addict s to quit smoking. However, the service stopped later. 2013 - Quitline thr ough Rajas than State Medical Helpline (Ongoing). 2016 - Government of India rolled out its first National Tobacco Quitline Services on the eve of the \"World No Tobacco Day\". NTQL Services in India The Government has established a National level tobacc o cessation Quitline in Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute (VPCI), New Delhi and the services h ave been expanded to regional satellite centres since 2018 and counseling is now availab le in regional languages at Dr . Bhubaneshwar Borooah Cancer Institute (BBC I), Guwahati; Na tional Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore; and T ata Memorial Centre (TMC), Mumbai. The quitline services Can be accessible from anywhere between 8AM to 8 PM. (except Monday - Holiday) Offers confidential, person alized and tailo red support to motivate the quit attempts in an individual addicted to tobacco . Types of Call in NTQL A national toll -free quitline is a telephone counseling service that can provide both proactive and reactive counseling free of ch arge to the calle r. A reactive quit line provides an immediate response to a call initiated by the tob acco user, but only responds to incoming calls. The reactive call includes the registration, present and past tobacco use history and personal details of the subjects and also ab out counseling session(s) whenever a caller feels the need for help. A proacti ve quit line involves setting up a schedule of follow -up calls to tobacco users to provide ongoing support. The proactive call comprises four outbound calls tailored to provide tobac co cessation service, usually complete within four to eight weeks dependin g upon the caller's tobacco quitting status . 115 Fig. 9.1 Algorithm for Telephonic Tobacco Counselling in NTQL 116 Role of Professional/Counselor in NTQLs The intervention i s provided by a trained tobacco counselor who has been trained especi ally in theoretical and prac tical approaches of motivational interviewing, following the WHO telephone counseling protocols. These include 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist and Arrange); 5Rs (Relevance, Risks, Rewards, Roadblocks, Repetition) in a time per iod of approximately 15 -minute counseling session. The telephonic IVR counseling sessions can be further increased to moderate (30 minutes) and intensive counseling (30 -40 minutes) sessions, depending upon the requirement of the tobacco user. The Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI) is being used to measure the tobacco dependency. Referral information such as nearest tobacco cessation clinic is provided to the interested participants. Tobacco quit pack consisting of tobacco quit calendar and tobacco quit guide are also mailed to the interested caller s by post or e-mail. The quitting status is analyzed on 4th proactive call which is almost after four weeks of follow -up post -tobacco cessation On 1 September 2018, 2 years later the launch of National Tobacco Quitline Services (NTQLS), ne w health warnings on tobacco products packets consisting of NTQLS toll -free number came into effect in India which resulted in 7.7 times calls hit on NTQL's IVR (Interacted Voice Response) . Benefits of Tobacco Quitline Services Can reach a large number of tobacco users in a cost-effective way. Can reduce access -related barriers to treatment. Serves as a gateway to other cessation resources Local health providers can refer tobacco user for quitting. Offers a treatment service that is appealing to a broad s pectrum of people. General Challenges of implementation of Tobacco Cessation in Quitline Services Patient follow up through telephone is difficult due to availabil ity High attrition of tobacco users High footfall of callers Lack of motivation through Telephonic counselling Lack of clinical support services for tobacco cessation. WHO TobLabNet methods WHO TobLabNet methods are laboratory testing methods for tobacco and related products developed by part of WHO's global technical netwo rk on tobacco -produc t regulation. 117 Nation al Tobacco Testing Laboratory In exercise of the powers conferred by section 11 of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Ad vertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (34 of 2003), th e Govt. of India recognizes the following testing laboratories for the purposes of testing the nicotine and tar contents in cigarettes and any other tobacco products, 1. The National Tobacco Testing Laboratory at National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research, 2. The National Tobacco Testing Laboratory at Central Drugs Testing Laboratory, Mumbai 3. The National Tobacco Testing Laboratory at Regio nal Drugs Testing Laboratory, Guwahati, Assam m-Cessation Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, in partnership with World Health Organisation and the International Telecommunications Union, has started an initiative for utilising mobile technology for tobacco cessation. WHO -ITU's 'Be Healthy Be Mobile' initiative, aims to reach out to tobacco users of all categories who want to quit tobacco uses and support them towards successful quitting through constant text messaging on mobile phones. Meet Florence* , WHO's digital health worker Florence is a 24/7 virtual health worker able to provide dig ital counselling services to th ose trying to quit tobacco. She also shares WHO public health messages and recommendations on tobacco and COVID -19. After a short conv ersation via video or text, Florence can help build confidence to quit smoking, make a plan, and recommend toll -free quit lines or apps. II. LAB INVESTIGATIONS Introduction: Nicotine can be measured in various biological specimens including plasma, s aliva and urine. A number of biochemical markers have been used to validate claims of non-smoking, including measures based on thioc yanate, nicotine, cotinine, and carbon monoxide using gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography and immunoas says. They vary in terms of cost and ease of administration, specificit y to tobacco, and ha lf-life. Indications 1. Participants with minimal level of smoking exposure (5 or 10 cigarettes per day) 2. Trials involving switching to alternative tobacco products (e.g., electronic cigarettes) that require biochemical verification of reduced exposure. 118 Biomarkers of Tobacco exposure a) Carbon Monox ide Levels ECO (ppm) COHb (%) Nicotine (ng/ml) Plasma Saliva Urine Plasma Saliva Urine c) Thiocyanate (\u00b5mo l/l) Plasma Saliva Urine Biomarkers of Tobacco exposure Nicotine c an be measured in va rious biological specimens including plasma, saliv a, and urine.. Urine levels correlate fairly well with plasma and saliva nicotine. Because of the short half -life o f nicotine levels are not useful in assessing tobacco use that occurred more than 8 -12 h previously. 1. Cotinine, the major proximate metabol ite of nicotine. However its specificity for tobacco use is limited for persons using nicotine containing medicati ons. Some immunoassays overestimate cotinine concentrations because of cross -reactivity wit h other nicotine metabolites. There is a good corre lation between levels of cotinine in biological fluids with nicotine intake from tobacco. The ratio of cotinine in saliva, compared to plasma, serum, or blood, averages about 1.3, with a range of 1.1 -1.4 in various studies. Saliva cotinine concentra tions a re lower in stimulated compared to unstimulated. The relatively long half-life of cotinine facilitates detection f or a few days after cessation of tobacco use. Plasma or saliva cotinine perform best, with 96-97% sensitivity and 99 -100% specificity, respect ively. The cut -off point widely used world -wide for Plasma or is 15ng/ml and 50ng/ml for urinary cotinine. Cotinine in urine can also be detected qualitatively. The te st is available for commercial uses in Indian market. It is easy , cheap and useful for biochemical confirmation of successful quitting. Advantages a) Highly specific b) Fairly long half-life c) Moderate cost for analysis Disadvantages Not sensitive when patient is on NRT 119 3. Carbon monoxide (CO) can be measured in expired air or in blood and are highly correlated. Instrumentation used for the measurement of expired CO measur es the rate of conversion of CO to CO2 as it passes over a catalyticall y active electrode a nd is measured as (eCO) in parts per million . Blood CO level is estima ted from carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) through spectrophotometric method. CO is reasonably specific for detecting heavy cigarette smoking but is of marginal utility for de tecting light smokin g because CO levels from smoking are low, and there are environmental sources of CO of similar magnitude. Measurement of CO is not applicable to detection of smokele ss tobacco use because CO is a combustion product. Disadvantages: Less sensitive for detec ting light smoking Fig. 9.3 Carbon M onoxide (CO) Instrument 3. Thioc yanate (SCN) can be measured in plasma, saliva, and urine. SCN is highly specific for heavy smoking. It is not applicable to det ection of smokeless tobacco use because it is a metabolite of a combust ion product, hydroge n cyanide. Fig. 9.2 Carbon Monoxide Measurement Scale 120 Disadvantages Specificity is not good for detecting light smoking Not applicable for smokeless tobacco use detection 4. Anabasine and anatabine are two nicotine -related alkaloids present in tobacco. Concentrations in urine can be determined using combined gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and is expensive. These alkaloids are very useful for detecting tobacco use in persons undergoing nicotine replacement therapy since these alkaloids are not present in nicotine - containing medicatio ns. After cessation of smoking, half lives are 16 h for anabasine and 10 h for anatabine. Advantages Useful in patients undergoing NRT Not applicable for smokeless tobacco use detection Cut-off point to differentiate smokers from non-smokers BOX CON TENT Plasma or saliva cotinine - 15 ng/ml; Urinary cotinine - 50 ng/ml; Expired air - CO -10 ppm; Plasma SCN - 78-84 mmol/l.

FIRST CALL QUESTIONS Demo graphics: The caller is a 41-year-old female . A) Tobacco use She smoke s within five minutes o f waking up. She smokes 20 cigarettes per day. B) Motivation and confidence She is motivated to quit because of a cough, her doctor's advice, the expense and the smell . Her confidence is low because she had a difficult time quitting once before. The quit lasted for about two weeks. She did not seek help with quitting or use a tobacco cessation medicine like the nicotine patch or gum. C) Triggers for smoking She smokes after meals, socializing with friends, during work breaks. She doesn't want her children to smoke. Her friends smok e and there are smokers at work. D) How the caller hear d about the quitline She calls the quitline after receiving a pamphlet at the doctor's office. RESPONSE Quitline experience When she calls the quitline the quitli ne counselor is friendly and greets her warmly. The quitline counselor provides an introdu ction to the programme so that the caller knows what to expect. The quitline counselor shar es expectations for the call. The quitline counselor transitions to assessm ent to learn abou t the caller's tobac co use, quit history, motivation to quit, and trigger s for smoking. The quitline counselor asks questions without judging and asks the caller if she has any questions or specific needs. The quitline counselor collaborat es with the caller to plan for quitting, including: Setting a quit date; Helping the caller find coping strategies to avoid smoking after meals, when socializing with friends and during work breaks; Selecting a tobacco cessation medicine; 122 Seeking help from friends and fa mily; Removing tobac co products from her surroundings The quitline counse lor recommends resources (printed material) to support the caller. The quitline counselor closes the call by asking the caller to summa rize action steps she will take to quit. The next call is scheduled. The quitline counselor suggests topics that will be covered in the next call. II. SECOND CALL During the second call the quitline counselor check s on progress, including quit status, urge severity, use of medicines, and stra tegies the ca ller is using to cop e with urges. The quitline counselor reinforces success and helps the caller: 1. By problem -solving the management of urges that she is finding hard to control; 2. To learn about relapse prevention by educating her about avoidin g, coping or escaping when feeling urges (ACE model); 3. By encouraging the caller to continue using her nicotine patch medication since it seem to be helping. Ongoing Calls During ongoing calls, the Quitline counselor follows up on progress, confirms quit s tatus, reinforces success, pr ovides practical problem -solving for any urges the ca ller is still experiencing, and plans for high-risk situations to ensure long -term success. The quitline counselor helps the caller to identify the benefits of being quit and ways to reward herself for s taying quit. KEY TAKEWAY Cotinine is highly spe cific and sensitive fo r tobacco use (in the absence of NRT) and has the advantages of a fairly long half -life and moderate cost for analysis. CO measurement is useful for determini ng smoking status. Its sensitivity is limited by the rapid elimination of C O, such t hat after 1 d ay of not smoking. CO levels are no different than those of non-smok ers. Specificity is limited by endogenous and environmental sources of CO. For this reason, CO may not distinguish light smokers from non -smokers. SCN is not recomm ended as a biomarker f or tobacco use because of inadequate sensitivity and specificity. Anabasine and anatabine are most useful for determining tobacco use in the presence of treatmen t with NRT. A potential limitation is the relatively high expense of the assay . 123 INTRODUCTION Tobacco consu mption is a public health concern in India and its impact is especially devastating among the lower socioeconomic status and rural areas. Th e use of tobacco in India is diverse from smoked or smokeless tobacco (SLT) products to its dual use with the majori ty of people using SLT produc ts. Tobacco dependence is preventable and may be addressed by many ways and Dental Healthcare Professi onals pla y an enor mous role i n rendering these services including individual as well as community -based interventions. Well -planned and targeted community -based programmes developed and implemented based on community health needs could prove to be very successful. Moreover, it is critical that such programmes are socially and culturally acceptable. The various community -based in terventions may be carried ou t are: 1. Addressing tobacco cessation through awareness and health education sessions, using innovative and interactive strategies. 2. Using audio -visual aids and social media platforms for dispersion of health promotive messages on tobacco cessation and contro l. 3. Targeting the vulnerable groups; like youth, children and women through innovative strategies. 4. Targ eting workplaces to raise awareness and promote tobacco -free workplaces. LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the professionals should be able to understan d the Methods to engage with local community stakeholders for promoting health and tobacco control Strategies that can be implemented by the institut ions at the community level for tobacco cessation and control 10. TOBACCO CESSATION IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS 10 0 124 5. Use and promotion of technological intervention s of tobacco cessation such as mCessation, and National Tobacco Quit Lines among the community. 6. Organize training and capacity building programs with community health workers, civil society organizations, local health practitioners etc. ROLE OF HEALTH EDUC ATION AND PROMOTION PROGRAM IN TOB ACCO CESSATION Mass health education using appropriate audiovisual aids and social media is sti ll one of the most effective wa ys of achieving tobacco cessation along with educational material that conveys anti - tobacco messages (both smoking and smokeless and second -hand smoke). Essential considerations for health education materials include: Identi fying the target audience prior to the development of Health Education material Selection of theme/ health message Health education material should be: Simple and reader -friendly style to command and retain the attention of the public needs to be developed . Preferably written in local language Information should be scientific and based on current evidence It must be scientifi cally validated with the feedback of public health experts and target audience following with the incorporation of suggested changes. Planni ng of hea lth educati on and promotion programs should be done in accordance to the proper protocol and adherence at all levels. The evaluation process of health education intervention is equally important. ROLE OF DENTAL COLLEGES, DENTAL CLINICS AND COMMUN ITY BASED HOS PITALS IN COMMUNITY BASED TOBACCO CESSATION INTERVENTIONS: Dental Colleges, Dental clinics and C ommunity based Hospitals have imme nse potential to create an impact in their local communities along with wider impact utilizing simple and cost-effective strategies in tobacco control. 1. Every Dental College and Dental Clinic a) Should understand the community health and dental health needs by carrying out regular health regular surveys. b) They should have detailed information on the patterns of tobacco co nsumption, at titudes 125 towards tobacco use, social and economic environment (daily life activities, use of leisure time, occupations, housing, education and network of social contacts). This would give the Institutes an understanding of what could be the pat terns, socio -cultural determinants and barriers to healthcare. Already lot of information is available throug h GATS 1 & 2, NFHS Surveys, etc. I f necessary, the dental institutes should carry out some need -specific short sample surveys. 2. Utilizing HR of Dent al colleges and Dental clinics in promoting Tobacco cessation: a) One way to accomplish community -level action w ould be to capitalize on the human resources like Dental specialists, General Dentists, Interns, Dental students and support staff availa ble at the Dental Colle ges and Dental clinics to branch out into the communities. b) The Dental Colleges/institutions must initiate structured tobacco use assessment and prevention activities for the Staff and students in the campus/hospital/clinics. This can be follow ed by assessi ng their attitudes towards tobacco use; knowledge about health risks involved. Once a staff memb er is identified with tobacco use, a structured tobacco cessation strategy can be initiated with them. Additionally, workplace -based staff mobilize d from the local communities can be mobilized to connect with the communities and promote tobacco cessation at the grassroot level. They can organize specific dental hospital outreach programmes in collaboration with civil society organizations l ike, local clubs, educa tional institutions, philanthropic organizations, faith-based organizations, professional associ ations and recreational facilities to inform the public about the dangers of tobacco use. 3. Brief and focused programmes on tobacco cessati on can be conducted in different settings like the local banks, bus depots, post offices, schools/colleges, etc. In rural areas such meetings can be held in schools, village panchayat meeting places, local administrative offices, fairs and weekly markets e tc. 4. Motiva ting cancer survivors to sensitize everyone as role models, campaigning on local television or radio channels 5. Organizing and conducting regular community -based awareness campaigns throughout the year. 6. Developing a referral chain for tobacco use, oral preca ncerous lesio n/ cancer and dental treatment needs from the community. 7. The Dental Colleges and Clinics must display the local Tobacco Cessation Clinic's contact details along with timings and National Quitline (1800 -11-2356) at multiple locations of the campus to promot e and mobilize patients. Every dental college, clinic and hospital should adhere to Tobacco Free Educational Institution (TOFEI) g uidelines to make their campus tobacco free with regular monitoring and evaluation. 126 ROLE OF SCHOOLS, CHILD REN AN D YOUTH IN TO BACCO CESSATION Schools remain one of the best organized clusters to target and develop posit ive healthy behaviors early in their life. Childhood and adolescence is the period when peer influence is at its peak and man y habi ts tha t usually l ast for a good part of one's lifetime are initiated. During these years, they are often targeted by tobacco industries through various attractive modalities like freebies, surrogate advertisements and sponsorships etc. Children and y outh should also be tar geted by the healthcare institutions, to promote health, dental health and prevent tobacco use. Tobacco control is a strategic bro ad- based intervention which can be implemented through strong legislation and other measures as suggest ed by the WH O MP OWER po licy package. But meanwhile dental professionals and healthcare institutions, can empower childr en through education which is directed towards the children as well as their parents. Education system can be utilized to spread informat ion, s hape a ttitudes an d strengthen skills relevant to tobacco control, preferably through the Tobacco -Free Educational Institution program (ToFEI). Use of schools and colleges for primary prevention as well as for early case - finding and active cessation efforts in a supp ortiv e manner among those who have already initiated the habit. Fig. 10.1 School Base Inte rvent ion in Toba cco Cessat ion 127 The flowchart below provides an outli ne for designing a School based Health Education Program for tobacco cessation : Fig. 10.2 School based Health Education Program for tobacco cessation 128 Workplace interventions for tobacco cessation: The biggest challenge of a workplace initia tive is employee time \"on floor\". Not many workplaces are willing to share this for the health of the employees. It should be stated alon g with propo sal o f a st rategy to resolve this issue - a statement on return -on- investment (ROI) may help! Most adults spend about a third of their day in their respective workplace environment. Workplaces could have both positive as well as negative impa ct on one's health and oral health. Tobacco use has a strong group behavioral pattern wherein people residing or workin g in common environments influence each other. The workplace is therefore a setting through which large groups of tobacco users can poten tially be reached by health promotion. Workplaces as a setting to prevent tobacco use can be used to great advantage with a targeted approach. The various advantages of workplace -based tobacco cessation strategies are: It provides access to a large number of people w ho make up a relatively stable population. It has the potential for higher participation rates than non-workplace environments. It may encourag e sustained peer-group support and positive peer pressure. It provides a particular opportunity to ta rget young m en, who traditionally have low general practitioner consultation rates and are thus less likely to benefit from opportunistic health promotion activity in primary care. The employee generally is not required to travel to the programme or to ded icate their own personal time to it. Occupational health staff may be on hand to give professional support. Cochrane based evidence suggests worksite -based individual counseling interventions demonstrated a benefit for the counseling programmes, with an O R of 1.96 (95% CI 1.51 to 2.54). Fig. 10.3 Spreading Awareness among Factory Wor kers 129 Fig. 10.4 Workplace based tobacco cessation algorithm Tobacco cessation through Systems Approach (Screen, Treat and Follow -up): In addition to the use of population -level approaches, the use of systems approac h enables al l health facilities and health care workers to deliver Tobacco Cessation to the individuals in a stepwise manner. Strengthening of existing cessati on services at all levels of health care through the Systems approach can be achieved by: Establ ishing suita ble infrast ructu re th at identifies and records tobacco use among all new and follow -up patients attending a ny health facility through WHO ICD - 11 screening for their tobacco use currently or anytime in the past. Coding by and link ing it to their health/ins urance id for any reference in future through a real-time national dashboard. Capacity building among all cadres of in-service healthcare workers, especially doctors, nurses, counselors and pharmacists along with regular CMEs (continued medical education) both in the gove rnmen t and/or private health sector to treat a tobacco using patient optimally and promptly along with his/her primary ailment. Following them up on a regular basis for 6 months to a year to support their effort and to ensure their staying totally abstinen t; at least in the very first month if the resources do not permit a longer follow -up (On 3rd and 7th days and at the end of 1 m onth). 130 CONCLUSION Tobacco use is a public health concern in India, with a negative impact on all, especia lly for the people from lower socio -economic backgrounds and those living in rural areas. Tobacco addiction can be prevented and treated in a number of ways, as we've discussed in this chapter. Dental health professionals can play an important role in prov iding these services to both tobacco users and the general public. Dental colleges and community -based gove rnment dental clinics have enormous potentia l to make a difference in their local communities and beyond by implementing simple and cost- effective t obacco cont rol strategies, especially by delivering tobacco cessation \"at every clinical encounter with a t obacco using patient through Systems Approac h\". In this chapter we've discussed the roles of: (1) Health Education and Promotion Program; and, Schoo ls, Childre n and You th in tobacco control, which are still one of the best places to target and develop pos itive and healthy behaviours in children at a young age. It is undeniable that providing cessation services in community settings and inv olving the community in all aspects of the intervention improves and achieves better cessation outcomes, i.e. a higher quit rate and higher number of former than current users. KEY TAKE AWAY 1. Tobacco use is a huge public health pr oblem in India with specifi c negative effects on the poor or those living in rural areas. 2. The role of Dental Colleges and Dental Healthc are Pro fessionals is critical in to bacco control, especiall y through the delivery of tobacco cessation to \"every tobacco using patient and at every clinical encounter\"; and by elimin ating the myths s/he may have . Displaying the toll -free numb er of National Quitline (1800 -11-2356) can add to their efforts. 3. Through Health Education and Promotion Programs being run in the scho ols such as ToFEI, the Dent ists can outreach the community to contribute significantly in minimizing tobacco initiati on by the children and you th and help them quit if the y are already tobacco users. Also, through oral screening, potential of serious denta l ailments can be averted. 131 INTRODUCTION India is the second largest tobacco consu mer, and third largest tobacco producer, in the world. The current cost of tobacco use in India includes 1 million deaths per year (approximately 1/6 of all tobacco - related deaths worldwide), and crores of direct attributab le health costs. The varie ty of tobacco products used in India is greater than elsewhere, and associ ated with additional complications in cluding a high burden of oral cancers from smoke as well as smokeless tobacco use. The varied socio -cultural histo ry and beliefs also has an impa ct, an d th ere is complicated legislation addressing the various types of tobacco use, enforced to different ext ents at various adminis trative levels across the country. The government has been involved in various initiatives in the form of implementing pol icies and acts to monitor and regulate tobacco related initiatives in the country.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION IN TOBACCO CESSATION 11 0 132 TOBACCO CONTROL INITIATIVES BY GOVERNMENT OF INDIA The Government of India has become increasingly engaged with India's tobacco problem over recent years. Some relatively sm all-scale preventative policies were introduced between 1975 and 2000. Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA): The more comprehensive Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA; addressing tobacco use in pu blic places, tobacco advertising, a nd sal e and packaging regulations) was introduced in 2003. The Framewo rk Convention of Tobacco Control (FCT C) brought into force i n 2005, in which the World Health Organization (WHO) treaty commits signatories for the implemen tation of wide -ranging measure s to l imit demand for tobacco, aid cessation of use, protect minors and non-users, regulate tobacco product s, minimize the contrab and market, and limit the negative influence of the tobacco industry. It promotes various c ontro l strategies including pricing and t axation measures, smoke -free policies, tobacco product legislati on, appropriate labeling of products (including health warni ngs), tobacco related education, prohibition of advertising and other promotion methods, pr ovisi on of cessation programmes, control of illicit tobacco product trade, control of tobacco sale to/by minors, and support for alternative employment strategies fo r tobacco workers. Soon after committing to the FCTC, the Indian Government established the National Tobacco Control Programm e to help achieve its provisions. The programme aims to establish tobacco cessation centres, training pro grammes for teachers, health workers and others, educational interventions for schools and the general population, and mechanisms to monitor enforcemen t of tobac co control legislation, at the district level. State and national -level monitoring of these ini tiatives has also been planned, along with research activities regarding alternative livelihood options, establish ment of tobacco product testing facilities and production of mass -media awareness campaigns. MONITORING OF TOBACCO USE Monitoring systems for tobacco use and exposu re to tobacco smoke are essential components of any tobacco control programme and are criti cal t o understanding and reversing th e toba cco epidemic. Monitoring tobacco control policies is needed fo r better planning and implementation of necessary public health interventions. There are a number of cost-effective policy interventions incorporated into the MPOWER package that build on the de mand -reduction measures contained in the WHO FCTC.

Conside ring the high interest in quitting among tobacco users , the Gove rnment of India launched a countrywide tobacco ces sation programme in January 2016 and National Toll -Free Quit line in May 2016. Almost 40% of tobacco users who called the Quitline and register ed for a cessa tion programme remained abstinent after 3 to 5 weeks, with 9% experiencing nicotine withdrawal sympt oms for which they were referred to cessation clinics. The 2016 GATS fact sheet released by India, further confirms the declining tobacco use prevalence due to adoption of key demand -reduction mea sures. Recognizing the importance of tobacco cessation, the first formal tobacco cessation clini cs were set up in 2002, as a joint initiative of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India and Worl d Health Organization India Country offi ce. Pr incipal investigators from selected tertiary level health facilities were trained in tobac co cessation services in Thailand. Thirteen tobacco cessation clinics (TCC) were set up in psychiatry (3), cancer (5), s urgical (2), cardiology (1), chest disea ses (1 ) as well as in a non -government organizational settin g (1). The TCCs were subsequently ex panded to five more Regi onal Cancer Centers (RCC) in 2005. The objectives of these clinics are to evolve cessation strat egies for smokers and smokeless tobacco users, to generate experience in tobacco cessation intervent ions and find out the feasibility of scaling up these interv ention strategies. Tobacco cessation needs to go beyond the health sector. The recent successful quit tobacco intervention carried out b y teac hers in the Indian State of Bihar is an excellent exam ple of tobacco cessation interventio n outside the health sec tor. The intervention comprised educational efforts, tobacco control policies and cessation supp ort. Among teachers in the intervention group the quit rate of 20 per cent was significantly higher compared to the five per cent in the control group. Tobacco cessation in India needs to be implemented in multiple settings. Incorporating tob acco cessation training in medical and other health pr ofessi onal education, training of health professionals to of fer cessation advice in their routin e health care practice, disease specific counselling sessions in diabetes, TB and selected other specialti es are likely to result in significant quit rates amon g current tobacco users. Effective implementation of the Framework Convention of Tobacco Control is likely to have impac t not only on the prevention of initiation of tobacco use but also on tobacco cessation to a large extent. EVALUATION The effectiveness of tobacco cessation programs depends on the intensity of program effort and the use of multiple interventions. A rule of thumb is that the more programs implemented together as a package or campaign, the more successful the interventions will be. The Dent al setting is an opportune time to help patients quit tobacco. A smoke -free environment and avoiding another advers e medical event can motivate patients to quit. Thus, developing an effective mechanism for evalu ation of such programs is essential to establ ish th eir efficacy and outcomes. Following is an algori thm to be followed in Dental setting s for the effective moni toring and evaluation of tobacco cessation initiatives: 136 I. Key Performance Indicators for the Denta l Colleges and Dental Clinics under NOHP: S. No KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Half -yearly report 1. Number of patients counselled of patients counselled telephonically 3. Number of patients with Quit attempts (Both physic ally & telephonically) 4. Number of patients success ful in Quitting (Both physically & telephonically) 5. Number of patients referred to Reha bilitation Centre 6. Training & Capacity Building Number of training sessions conducted Number of Students/ Faculties trained 7. Number of research conducted related to Tobacco control & cessation Table 11.2 K ey Performance Indicators for Dental Colleges & Dental Clini cs II. Process Measures focus on measuring how services are provided. Examples include the number of: Staff trained Educational sessions held Calls to the Quit-line Partnerships the program has formed with other stakeholder organizations Meetings held with partners to assess progress and make changes Staff trained in program practices Patient s enrolled in and/or served by the program Referrals to other servic es News stories covering tobacco control issues in the target area . III. Outcome Measures focus on measuring the results or overall achievements of the program. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a list of outcome variables for compr ehen sive tobacco control programs . Other examples include: Change in availability of health and social services in the community (for example, locations for tobacco cessation classes, pr oviders regularly counselling patients on tobacco usage) 137 KEY TAKE AWAY The Government of India has become increasing ly engaged with India's tobacco problem over recent years The MPOWER initiative under the WHO, FCTC is major milestone in the process of promoting monitoring and evaluation o f tobac co cessation Major Mileston e in this direction include COTPA Act, formation of the National Oral Health Progra mme and the development of TCC's to promote tobacco cessation Developing an e ffective mechanism for evaluation of programme focusing on tobacco cessation in essential to establish their efficacy and outcomes. Change in hea lth behaviours over time (for ex ample, number of cigarettes smoked i n the last week, or numb er of quit attempts) Change in awareness of health topics (for example, lung cancer, hypertens ion) Change in policies and legislation related to health (for e xample , school policy change to ban/li mit smoking on the property) Return on investment (ROI) in program examining social and healthcare cost savings CONCLUSION Remarkable progress has bee n made in global tobacco control since MPOWER was introduced a decade ago as a tool to help implement the World Health Organizat ion's Framework Conventi on on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). Nearly two thirds of countries (121 of 194) - comprising 63% o f the world's population - have now introduced at least one MPOWER measure at the highest level of achievement (not including Monitoring or Mass media campaigns , which are assessed separately). Tobacco control monitoring includes: monitoring tobacco use in dicators (often understood as the surveillance of tobacco use patterns and trends ); monitoring expos ure to tobacco smoke; and monitoring policies designed to re duce tobacco use or exposure to tobacco smoke. The various initiatives by the Govt. of India in the form of COTPA act and further development of the National Tobacco Contr ol Program have been steps further in the same direction. Additionally, theestablishm ent of Tobacco Cessation Centres has been further implemented to emphasize tobacco cessation in the various settings. Hence, the monitoring and evaluation of these systems is essential for the effective functioning of mechanisms of action. 138 ANSWER KEY CHAPTER 2 Answer a), 4(c), 5(a) 12.

The following scale allows the professio nal to: a) Determin e the strength of the urge, b) Determine the likelihood of use. Listed below are the possible triggering situations. Ask each patient to assign a number according to what they think best applies to the m: 0 1 2 3 4 None Weak Moderate Strong Very Strong S.NO STATEMENTS STRENGTH OF URGES LIKEHOOD OF USING 1. I am in a place where I usually use tobacco 2. I am around people who usually use tobacco 3. I see my co -workers/ family members using it 4. I am thinking of the last I used tobacc o 5. I feel bored or happy 6. I have increased craving, urge or desire in my mouth 7. I am having tea or engaging in a specific activity that I used to do earli er while using tobacco 8. I feel stressed/ anxious or upset 9. I am offered tobac co by a friend 10. I pass by a tobacco vendor/shop 168 ANNEXURE E Myths and Facts Related to the Efficacy of Behavioral Inter ventions MYTHS v/s FACTS ABOUT THE EFFICAC Y OF BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTIONS S.NO MYTH FACT 1. Behavioral interventions don't work because Tobacco Dependence is a physiological phenomenon and hence can only be managed by pharmacotherapy/ medication. Tobacco Dependence is physiological in the sense that nicotine causes the release of certain neurotransmitters which allow for a calming effect and have an addictive nature. However, the cycle of addiction is marked by the principle of habituation and learning, where the act of using tobacco becomes assoc iated to a specific object or situation and leads to cravings and hence mainta ins the vicious cycle of tobacco -use. 2. Behavioral counselling is not as effective as medication. Both Behavioral Counselling and medi cation have a role to play in the process of cessation. On one side where medication is helpful in managing the withdraw al symptoms of substance - use, behavioral counselling on the other focuses on facilitating behavior change by helping the individual to understand the 3. Behavioral Counselling d oesn't work because the Tobacco -user is responsible for own behavi or and hold certain beliefs like; \"I can leave whenever I want to, how can someone help me leave it just by talking\". Tobacco -use consistently leads to the development of a specific habit, w hich then becomes tied to different emotional states (like stress, anxiety, sa d mood) and even certain everyday activities. These situations act as triggers, which need to be managed. The same are the focus of Beha vioral Interventions. 4. Most tobacco users don't like being asked about their substance taking behavior and hence woul d not benefit from behavioral interventions. Patients have a positive view of health care providers who inquire about their smoking stat us; and believe the providers are not fulfilling their duty if they do not inquire. 169 ANNEXURE F Myths Related to Tobacco -use S.NO MYTH FACT 1. Smokeless forms of tobacco are less dangerous Smokeless forms of tobacco are equally carcinogenic and contain around 3000 harmful chemicals causing dea dly damage. Hence, they are equally hazardous. 2. \"If I don't use Hook ah, Chew tobacco and Smoke, I will lose friends.\" Tobacco -use is promoted as a status symbol among the youth. This tactic promoted through soci al media plays a crucial role in emphasizi ng this incorrect belief among the mases. 3. \"If I smoke, I may b e caught, but if I chewed tobacco, no one would know.\" With time, oral tobacco -use stains teeth and gums, causing tell-tale marks that often give th e user away. Even if these are missed, whe n the oral cavity starts succumbing to the devastating impact of t obacco, the deterioration is evident in the form of different oral health conditions such as 'white lesions or tobacco pouch keratosis 4. Bidis, Smokeless tobacco and shisha, etc. are less dangerous These products are a different form of tobacco, and often do not include the same warning labels, or carry the same taxes and other restrictions slapped on standard cigarettes. This causes individuals to wrongly assume they are less dangerous. In fact, bidis produce three times more carbon monoxide and nicotine and five times more tar than regular cigarettes. Thus, like cigarettes, these products are also deadly. 5. Tobacco is good for the teeth, and helps in cleansing them Tobacco is used in var ious forms like tobacco containing powders like Gul and pastes like Gudakhu. These products are advertised locally and by word of mouth. These products target vulnerable populations like women, who 170 arenlow on a wareness and health priority. They are seen using such products to clean their teeth, and tending to hold them in their mouths, as they slowly become addicted to the nicotine content. In fact, manufacturers of tobacco pastes recommend letting the paste linger for a while in the mouthbefore rinsing it out. It goes on to cause oral potentially malignant diseases l ike oral leukoplakia, oral submucous fibrosis etc. 6. Smoking improves sexual performance Smoking damages penile blood vessels, causing impotence. Improved sexual performance is next to impossible, no matter what these tobacco promotion gimmicks convey. 7. Tobacco helps you lose weight, stay slim Tobacco -use damages your taste buds and suppresses your appetite. Then it ravages the body systems, and sooner or later leads to chronic debilitat ion. As a consequence, significant weight reduction would occur bu t at the cost of significant hazard to health. 8. Smoking is doing your own thing, and involves \"breaking the rules\" Glamourizing smoking as an adu lt habit, and an act of rebellion and nonc onformity, is yet another tobacco promotion strategy used by the tobacco industry. It is essential to recognize the same and desensitise the mases about these ideologies. 171 ANNEXURE G GLOSSARY Abstinence A period of being quit, i.e., stopping the us e of cigarettes or other tobacco products. Addiction Unlik e toler ance and dependence, addiction is a disease; but like tolerance and dependence, addiction can result from taking drugs or alcohol repeatedly. If a p erson keeps using a drug and can't stop, d espite negative consequences from using the drug, they have an addiction. Behavioral interventions Interventions designed to affect the actions that individuals take with regard to their health. Biochemical verif ication Also called 'biochemical validatio n' or A procedure for checking a tobac co user's report that he or she has not smoked or used tobacco. It can be measured by testing levels of nicotine or cotinine or other chemicals in b lood, urine, or saliva, or by measuring le vels of carbon monoxide (CO) in exhaled breath or in blood. Cessa tion Also called 'quitting'. The goal of treatment to help people achieve abstinence from smoking or other tobacco use, also used to describe the process of changing the behavior Chewing tobacco Also called Smokeless tobacco. It encompasses all tob acco products that are consumed in an unburned form. Smokeless tobacco can be used orally or nasally. It is placed in the mouth, usually between the cheek and lower lip, and may be chewed. Also cal led spit tobacco. Cold Turkey Quitting abruptly, and/or quitting without behavioural or pharmaceutical support Continuous abstinence Also called 'sustained abstinence'; 'prolonged abstinence'. A measure of cessat ion involving avoidance of all tobacco use since the quit day until the time the assessment is made. The def inition occasionally allows for lapses. This is the most rigorous measure of abstinence. Craving A very intense urge or desire to smoke or chew tob acco Current smoker An adult who has smok ed 100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime and who currently smokes cigarettes. Dependence Dependence means that when a person stops using a drug, their body goes through \"withdrawal\": a group of physical and mental symptoms that can range from mild to life -threatening. Nicotine dependence is indicated by repeated unsuc cessful efforts to stop smoking, experiencing withdrawal symptoms when attempting to stop tobacco use. Many people who 172 take a prescription medicine ev ery day over a long period of time can bec ome dependent; when they go off the drug, they need t o do it gra dually, to avoid withdrawal discomfort. But people who are dependent on a drug or medicine aren't necessarily addicted. Dopamine A neurotransmitter in the brain which regulates mood, attentio n, pleasure, reward, motivation and movement Former smoker An adult who has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime but who had quit smoking at the time of interview. Lapse/ slip Terms sometimes use d for a return to tobacco use after a peri od of abstinence. A lapse or slip might be defined as a puff or two on a cigarette. This may proceed to relapse, or abstinence may be regained. People who lapse are very likely to relapse, but some treatments may h ave their effect by helping people recover from a lapse. Neural nicotinic acetylcholine recept ors(nAChR) Areas in the brain which are thought to respond to nicotine, forming the basis of nicotine addiction by stimulating the overflow of dopamine Never smoker An adult who has never smoked, or who has smoked less than 100 cigarettes in his or her li fetime Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) A tobacco cessation treatment in which nicotine from tobacco is replaced for a limited period by pharmaceutical nicoti ne. This reduces the craving and withdrawa l experienced during the initial period of abstinence while users are learning to be tobacco - free. The nicotine dose can be taken through the skin, using patches, by inhaling a spray, or by mouth using gum or lozen ges. Nicotine An alkaloid derived from to bacco, responsible for the psychoactive and addictive effects of smoking . Nicotine withdrawal It is characterized by a range of effects during abstinence including severe craving for nicotine and/or tobacco, feeli ngs of irritability, anxiety, anger, difficulty in concentrating, restlessness, impatience, increased appe tite, weight gain, and insomnia. Typically, symptoms begin a few hours after . Oral Health Oral health is multi -faceted and includes the ability to speak, smile, smell, taste, touch, chew, sw allow and convey a range of emotions through facial expressions with con fidence and without pain, discomfort and disease of the craniofacial complex (head, face, and oral cavity 173 Pharmacotherapy A treatment using pharmaceutical drugs, e.g. NRT, bupropion, varenicline Point prevalence abstinence (PPA) A measure of cessation ba sed on behaviour at a particular point in time, or during a relatively brief specified period, e.g. 24 hours, 7 days. Prolonged Abstinence A measure of cessation which typically allow s a 'grace period' following the quit date (usually of about two weeks), to allow for slips/lapses during the first few days when the effect of treatment may still be emerging. Quit Attempt A quit attempt was more quantitatively defined as having stopped tobacco use for one day or longer with the intention of quittin g. Relap se A return to regular smoking after a period of abstinence Second Hand Smoke Also called environmental tobacco smoke, involuntary smoking, a nd passive smoking. It is the combination of smoke from the burning end of a cigarette/bidi etc. and the smoke breathed out by smokers Self-efficacy The belief that one will be able to change one's behaviour, e.g., to quit smoking Tapering A gradual decrease in dose at the end of treatment, as an alternative to abruptly stopping treatment Tar The toxic ch emic als found in cigarettes. In solid form, it is the brown, tacky residue visible in a cigarette filter and deposited in the lungs of smokers. Third H and Smoke It is referred to the toxic chem icals built up for weeks and months from second ha nd smoke li ke co ating the surfaces of room and smokers' belongings Tobacco Cessation Tobacco cessation refers to the process of quitting the habit of using tobacco Tolerance Tolerance happens when a perso n no longer responds to a drug in the way they did at first. So, it takes a higher dose of the drug to achieve the same effect as when the person first used it. Nicotine tolerance results when greater nicotine dosages are required to achieve the same magni tude of response. 174 "}
