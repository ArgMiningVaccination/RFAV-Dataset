If you have a glass shower door, also make sure to make a daily habit to use a squeegee after each shower use. Daily Shower Spray is written as part of an ongoing partnership with NOW Foods.

At least not \"deep clean.\" I love keeping things tidy, putting everything away once it's been used, and I love when things ARE clean. But the idea of deep cleaning, especially the bathroom area, just hasn't ever been something to bring a lot of joy for me. Recently, we moved into our new home and our master bath has a glass shower door...suddenly I actually DO care about keeping the shower crisp, white, fresh, clean, and the door streak free. Go figure! Insert the need for a Daily Shower Spray. Now, I am not claiming to be an expert in natural cleaning, but I do my best to attempt to use products with less chemicals when possible. And I kind of enjoy researching the benefits of essential oils and how to make my own cleaning products! After reading through some research articles (here, here, here, here) on the antibacterial and antimicrobial properties of tea tree oil (and a few other essential oils mixed in too) I thought making my own Daily Shower Spray would be simple, fun, and effective...and I was right! Funnel (optional, but makes pouring into the glass bottle a little easier) Daily Shower Spray comes together SO quickly - the process is simply putting the ingredients into the glass bottle (that's where the funnel comes in!), shake and spray! I spray this on my shower door each morning after I shower, then I squeegee the door to remove the water and the spray. It leaves the door streak free! I also spritz the spray on the tile in my shower to help prevent any bacteria from growing. Disclaimer: We have only lived in our house for about 2 months, and I have been using this spray for about a month. So far, it appears to be working (everything still looks sparkling!), but as I mentioned above...I am not a natural cleaning expert I would love to know if you give this daily shower spray a try! Spritz the inside of the shower daily to prevent soap scum and mildew build up. If you have a glass shower door, also make sure to make a daily habit to use a squeegee after each shower use. Ingredients Scale 1 cup water 1 cup white vinegar 15 drops tea tree oil 15 drops of your favorite scented essential oil (I love lemon, peppermint, or lavender) Instructions Combine all ingredients in a blue or amber glass bottle (I use a funnel to help here!). Shake and spritz the inside of your shower daily to prevent soap scum and mildew build up. If you have a glass shower door, spritz this and then squeegee after each shower use. Notes This recipe was inspired by many other shower door spray recipes and a bit of research online. "}
