In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards (Government Auditing Standards) , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial s tatements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a hi gh level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, Deloitte & Touche LLP 50 W 5th Street Suite 200 Cincinnati, OH 45202- www.deloitte.com 2 misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards , we: Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regard ing, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control -related matters that we identified during the audit. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated September 30, 2022 on our consideration of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Company's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 7 (1) Accounting Policies - (a) Basis of Consolidation - Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati Children's), River City Insurance Limited (River City), CHMC Community Health Services Network (CHSN), HealthVine LLC (HealthVine) and other entities with the purpose to hold land for future use, which are under common management, are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are collectively referred to as Cincinnati Children's. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Cincinnati Children's is an Ohio not -for-profit corporation providing pediatric healthcare services, education, and research. River City is a captive insurance company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Children's. CHSN is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Children's whose purp ose is to manage primary care practices in a community setting. Other land holding entities are wholly owned subsidiaries of Cincinnati Children's whose purpose is to hold land for future use. (b) Supporting Organizations - The Children's Hospital (TCH) and Convalescent Hospital Fund for Children (CHFC) are both Ohio not -for-profit corporations that provide financial support to Cincinnati Children's. The TCH and CHFC purpose clauses both specify the support of Cincinnati Children's as the organization's sole purpose. Additionally, certain endowment funds of these supporting organizations are restricted by the donors for specific operating purposes of Cincinnati Children's. As such, the assets of TCH and CHFC are recorded in Cincinnati Children's consolidated financial statements as Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations and as Net Assets with Donor Restrictions. Changes in the fair value of Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations are recorded as a Gain (Loss) in Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. The majority of receipts are from TCH and CHFC donor -restricted endowment funds or are other receipts that are designated by the supporting organizations' Boards of Trustees for specific operating purposes. The receipts are reflected in Gifts and contributions of financial assets and other income with donor restrictions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. Upon spending, such funds are reflected in Other restricted net assets used to support operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. Other receipts from TCH are designated by the supporting organization's Boar d of Trustees to provide general support. The receipts are reflected in Receipts from supporting organizations without donor restrictions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. (c) Support Received from Supporting Organizations - TCH and CHFC provide annual support to Cincinnati Children's through transfers of dividend and interest earnings on investments, net of investment management fees, administrative expenses, and donor -required income reinvestments. The supporting organizations' respective Boards of Trustees may also make certain pledges of principal without donor restriction in support of key projects or initiatives at Cincinnati Children's. In January 2020, CHFC's Board of Trustees made a gift in the amount of $36,000 to support the construction of a new facility at the College Hill Campus and programmatic support of Cincinnati Children's Pursuing our Potential in Mental Health initiative. The agreement has certain criteria that represent donor -imposed conditions that must be overcome before Cincinnati Children's is entitled to the assets promised. Contributions of $6,651 and $1,855 were made for the years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The receipts are reflected in Gifts an d contributions of financial assets and other income with donor restrictions and in Net assets used for purchase of property and equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 8 The following table details transfers betwee n Cincinnati Children's and Supporting Organizations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets: 2022 2021 Transfers of net assets with donor restrictions included in Gifts and contributions of financial assets and other income: Cincinnati Children's from TCH Total $114,710 $109,354 Transfers of net assets without donor restrictions included in Receipts from (Transfers to) supporting organizations: Cincinnati Children's from TCH $ 4,229 $ 3,757 to TCH (1) (82,346) (37,181) Total $(78,117) $(33,424) (1) The purpose of this transfer is to establish funds designated to support divisional activities and strategic priorities. (d) Revenue Recognition - The following revenue streams are subject to the revenue recognition guidance in Accounting Standards Codification No. 606 (ASC 606) \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\": 2022 2021 207,082 $2,562,638 $2,433,772 Net Patient Service Revenue Cincinnati Children's net patient service revenue generally relates to contracts with patients in which the performance obligations are to provide health care services to patients. As patients simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of health care provided by Cincinnati Children's, the performance obligations meet the criteria to be satisfied over time. Net patient service revenue is recorded as services are prov ided. Payment for such services is due between thirty to forty- five days from payer receipt of claim. Consideration for patient service revenue is variable. Agreements with payers typically provide for payments at amounts less than established charges. Effective January 1, 2021, Cincinnati Children's signed an agreement with an Ohio Medicaid managed care company in which performance obligations are to stand- ready to provide care for approximately 130,000 children. The performance obligation to stand -ready is satisfied over time. Cincinnati Children's is reimbursed under a variable capitation methodology for hospital services. All physician and home care services are reimbursed based on provider fee schedules. The hospital services are reimbursed through a variable capitation payment which represents the amount remaining after payment has been made for (a) Cincinnati Children's physician services, (b) Cincinnati Children's home care services, (c) services provided to members by facilities outside the Cinc innati Children's network, and (d) an actuarially determined accrual for incurred but not reported claims (see Note 1h). Under delegation agreements, Cincinnati Children's receives fixed payments to perform the required medical management, care management and care coordination functions. Medicaid managed care organizations retain risk for payments to providers. The amount of net patient service revenue recorded under this arrangement in fiscal year 2022 and 2021 was $174,467 and $103,836, respectively. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 9 Laws and regulations concerning government programs, including Medicaid and Medicare, are complex and subject to varying interpretation. As a result of investigations by governmental agencies, various health care organizations have received requests for information and notices regarding alleged noncompliance with those laws and regulations, which, in some instances, have resulted in organizations entering into significant settlement agreements. Compliance with such laws and regulations may also be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action, including fines, penalties, and potential exclusion from related programs. There can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not challenge Cincinnati Childre n's compliance with these laws and regulations, and it is not possible to determine the impact (if any) such claims or penalties would have upon Cincinnati Children's. In addition, the contracts Cincinnati Children's has with third party payers also provi de for retroactive audit and review of claims. At June 30, 2022, Cincinnati Children's has settled all Medicaid cost reports through 2016 and all Medicare cost reports through 2020. Settlements with third party payers for retroactive adjustments due to au dits, reviews or investigations are considered variable consideration and are included in the determination of estimated transaction price for providing patient care. These settlements are based on the terms of the payment agreement with the payer, corres pondence from the payer, and Cincinnati Children's historical settlement activity, including an assessment to ensure that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Estimated settlements are a djusted in future periods as adjustments become known based on new information or as years are settled and no longer subject to such audits, reviews, and investigations. Adjustments arising from a change in transaction price were not material in fiscal yea rs 2022 and 2021. Generally, patients who are covered by third party payers are responsible for related deductibles and coinsurance, which vary in amount. Cincinnati Children's also provides services to uninsured patients and offers those uninsured patients a discount, either by policy or law, from standard charges. Cincinnati Children's estimates the transaction price for patients with deductibles and coinsurance and from those who are uninsured based on historical experience and current market condition s. The initial estimate of the transaction price is determined by reducing the standard charge by established contractual adjustments, discounts, and implicit price concessions. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are generally rec orded as adjustments to patient service revenue in the period of change. Consistent with Cincinnati Children's mission, care is provided to patients regardless of their ability to pay. Therefore, Cincinnati Children's has determined it has provided implicit price concessions to uninsured patients and patients with other uninsur ed balances. The implicit price concessions included in estimating the transaction price represent the difference between the amounts billed to patients and the amounts Cincinnati Children's expects to collect based on its collection history with those pa tients. Patients who meet Cincinnati Children's criteria for charity care are provided care without charge or at amounts less than established rates. Amounts determined to qualify as charity care are not reported as net patient service revenue. Becau se the majority of its performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year, Cincinnati Children's has elected to apply the optional exemption provided in FASB ASC 606- 10- 50-14(a) and, therefore, is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the fiscal year. The unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations referred to above are primarily r elated to inpatient acute care services at the end of the fiscal year. The performance obligations for these contracts are generally completed when patients are discharged, which generally occurs shortly after the end of the fiscal year. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 10 In both fiscal y ears 2022 and 2021, substantially all of net patient service revenue is derived from third - party payment programs (Medicaid, insurance companies and various managed care agreements). Cincinnati Children's classifies its patients by payer. The following t able disaggregates Cincinnati Children's net patient service revenue by payer categories for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021: 2022 2021 Commercial details the percentage of accounts receivable by payer category as of June 30, 2022 and 2021: 2022 2021 Cincinnati Children's other revenue generally relates to contracts with external organizations in which the performance obligations are to provide research services or other various fee- for-service arrangements outside the scope of healthcare services. Relief funds received as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act are also included in other revenue. See Note 1(s) for further discussion on the COVID -19 Pandemic. Revenue from industry contracts and certain government contracts is earned based on performance obligations to provide research services to the external organizations. License and royalty revenue relates to contracts with other organizations in which our performance obligations are to provide intel lectual property to the organization. Revenue is also earned for various other contracted fee -for-service arrangements where services are performed for external organizations outside the scope of healthcare services for Cincinnati Children's patients. Per formance obligations for industry and government contracts, license and royalty contracts, and various other fee- for-service arrangements are satisfied over time. Consideration is fixed based on contracted price, and there is no significant variable consid eration related to these agreements. (e) Graduate Medical Education - Cincinnati Children's receives Federal graduate medical education funding. Other revenue of $11,762 and $11,188 was recognized for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 1 Specialty contracts are single case agreements or contracts for specialty services, such as transplants. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 11 (f) Tax Exempt Status - Cincinnati Children's, CHSN and HealthVine a re recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code as charitable organizations qualifying under Section 501(c)(3). River City is a captive insurance company and has no income tax obligations. Other land holding entities with the purpose to hold land for future use are limited liability corporations whose income is taxable to Cincinnati Children's. The income tax provisions recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial s tatements are immaterial for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Cincinnati Children's accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic (ASC) 740 \"Income Taxes\". It is Cincinnati Children's policy to classify the e xpense related to interest and penalties, if any, to be paid on underpayments of income taxes within other expenses. There were no material penalties or interest recognized in fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Cincinnati Children's paid $5,227 in income taxes for unrelated business income during the year ended June 30, 2022. Fiscal years 2019 through 2022 are subject to examination by both the Federal and State tax jurisdictions. (g) Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market investments (including money market mutual funds) and demand deposits. Money market investments have maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Cash is held primarily in two financial institutions. (h) Inventories and Prepaid Expenses - Inventories consi st primarily of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals and are valued on an average cost method. As part of Cincinnati Children's variable capitation agreement, reimbursement is reduced by an actuarially determined estimate for incurred but not reported cla ims. Cincinnati Children's recorded incurred but not reported claims of approximately $23,507 and $21,107 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The estimate is recorded as an increase in prepaid expenses and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. (i) Marketable Securities - Cincinnati Children's accounts for its investments under ASC 958 -320 \"Not -for- Profit Entities - Securities\" and ASC 958 -321 \"Not -for-Profit Entities - Investments Equity Securities.\" Cincinnati Children's carries its marketable secu rities at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in net investment return (loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. At both June 30, 2022 and 2021, 19% of Cincinnati Children's marketable secu rities were invested in U.S. Treasury securities. (j) Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight -line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to forty years, as follows: Land Improvements 3-25 years Buildings and Building Improvements 5 -40 years Equipment 3-25 years Cincinnati Children's evaluates long -lived assets under the provisions of ASC 360 \"Property Plant and Equipment.\" During fisca l years 2022 and 2021, Cincinnati Children's did not incur any losses related to impairment of property and equipment. (k) Goodwill - Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of an entity acquired. Cincinnati Childre n's acquired the assets of a pediatric primary care practice, resulting in Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 12 goodwill of $8,583 in fiscal year 2021, and elected to apply the accounting alternatives available for not - for-profit entities. During the year ended June 30, 2022, no amounts were recorded to goodwill. Goodwill is amortized over a 10 -year period and tested for impairment when a triggering event occurs. During fiscal year 2022 and 2021, $858 and $429 of amortization expense and no impairment losses were recognized, respectively. (l) Leases - Cincinnati Children's leases property and equipment under finance and operating leases. Cincinnati Children's determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right -of-use assets and lease obligations are recognized for leases with terms gre ater than 12 months based on the net present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. When readily determinable, Cincinnati Children's uses the interest rate implicit in the lease to determine the present value o f future minimum lease payments. However, most of Cincinnati Children's leases do not have a readily determinable implicit interest rate. For these leases, Cincinnati Children's uses a collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the period and cash payment stream comparable with that of each lease. The right -of-use asset and lease obligations include a value for options to extend a lease if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. The current portion of operating lease obligat ions is included in the current portion of long- term debt and lease obligations and the non- current portion is separately stated as operating lease obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The related right -of-use assets are included in operating lease right -of-use assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight -line basis over the lease term and is included in purchased services in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets. The current portion of finance lease obligations is included in current portion of long- term debt and lease obligations and the non- current portion is separately broken out as finance lease obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The related finan ce lease right -of-use assets are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease right -of-use assets are amortized using the straight -line method over the shorter period of the lease term or the estimated useful li fe of the property or equipment. Such amortization expense is included in depreciation in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets. (m) Costs of Borrowing - Interest incurred on borrowed funds, net of interest earned on restricted bond funds, during the period of construction of capital assets is capitalized as a component of the cost of acquiring those assets. In fiscal years 2022 and 2021, Cincinnati Children's capitalized $4,329 and $11,013 of interest related to construction in progress, respectively. Total cash paid for interest was approximately $35,339 and $33,655 in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Deferred bond issuance costs and issuance premiums are amortized using the effective interest method over the period th e related obligation is outstanding. (n) Interest Rate Swap Agreement - Cincinnati Children's has an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk associated with the variable rate 2018Z and 2018AA bonds. The swap agreement is measured at fair val ue and recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other long- term liabilities. Cincinnati Children's recognizes gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement as non -operating gains and losses within net inves tment return on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. (o) Net Asset Classifications - Cincinnati Children's reports its financial position and activities according to the following net asset classifications: Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 13 Net assets without donor restrictions - Net assets that are not subject to donor -imposed restrictions and may be expended for any purpose in performing the primary objective of the organization are classified as net assets without donor restrictions. These net asset s may be used at the discretion of management of Cincinnati Children's. Net assets with donor restrictions - Net assets subject to stipulations imposed by donors or supporting organizations are classified as net assets with donor restrictions. Some restri ctions are temporary in nature; those restrictions will be met by fulfilling a certain purpose or by the passage of time. Other donor restrictions are perpetual in nature, whereby the donor has stipulated the principal be maintained in perpetuity. Net a ssets with donor restrictions are comprised of the following: 2022 2021 Subject to expenditure for specified purpose: $ 40,342 Research 96,634 35,921 44,831 190,026 195,224 Subject to expenditure for specified purpose, at supporting organizations: Research 14,525 15,507 Education 4,326 4,604 19,926 21,255 Subject to expenditure based on Board discretion of the supporting organization, held at supporting organizations 2,179,232 2,202,814 2,179,232 2,202,814 Investment in perpetuity, the income from which is expendable for specified purpose, held at Cincinnati Children's: Clinical 1,161 917 Research 18,120 17,929 Education Administration and Other 2,990 3,000 23,578 23,198 (Continued on next page) Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 14 Investment in perpetuity, the income from which is expendable for specified purpose, held at supporting organizations: Clinical 53,484 46,872 Research 2,044,408 75,176 81,498 2,261,343 2,319,643 Subject to appropriation and expenditure when a specified event occurs: Upon death of insured party 2,290 1,958 2,290 1,958 Total net assets with donor restrictions $4,676,395 $4,764,092 (p) Revenue and Gains in Excess of Expenses and Losses - The Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets subtotals operating revenues, gains and other support, operating expenses and nonoperating gains as Revenue and gains in excess of expenses and losses. Other changes in net assets without donor restrictions are receipts from and transfers to supporting organizations, pension and post - retirement health liability adjustments, and net assets released from restrictions used for purchase of property and equipment, which are exclud ed from Revenue and gains in excess of expenses and losses. (q) Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (r) New Accounting Pronouncements - In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018 -15, Intangibles \u2014 Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Internal -Use Software. This standard aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal -use software. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Cincinnati Children's adopted ASU 20 18-15 effective July 1, 2021. Adopting this standard had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In September 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020- 07, Not-for-Profit Entities (Topic 958): Presentation and Disclosures by Not -for-Profit Entit ies for Contributed Nonfinancial Assets . This ASU changes the presentation and disclosure requirements for not -for-profit entities to increase transparency about contributed nonfinancial assets. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2021, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after June 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. Cincinnati Children's adopted this standard effective July 1, 2021 and has determined that the impact on the consolidated financial statements is not material. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 15 (s) The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act - The CARES Act was passed by Congress on March 27, 2020 to aid organization and individuals with the economic impacts of COVID - 19. Cincinnati Children's received $22,1 91 and $50,000 in relief funds from the Department of Health and Human Services in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Relief funds are recorded as other revenue in the Operating revenues, gains and other support section of the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. In addition to the distribution of relief funds, the CARES Act also included electable payroll tax credits and deferrals. Cincinnati Children's elected to delay paymen t of the employer portion of the Social Security payroll taxes on wages paid from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020 in the amount of $45,656. Half of the total deferred amount was paid in December 2021 and the remaining portion is due by December 3 1, 2022. At June 30, 2022, deferred payroll taxes of $22,828 are included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At June 30, 2021, deferred payroll taxes of $22,828 were included in Other Long- Term Liabilities, and $2 2,828 were included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Liquidity and Availability - Financial assets available for general expenditure within one year of the balance sheet date consist of the following: 2022 2021 Amounts available for general expenditure Cash and cash equivalents $ 293,360 $ 274,863 Marketable securities 1,259,210 1,352,918 2,275,641 Less: Board -designated assets 100,000 100,000 assets available for general expenditure $2,106,260 $2,175,641 Cincinnati Children's has cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities (more fully described in Note 4), patient receivables and certain other receivables which are liquid and available for general expenditure within one year in the normal course of operations. Accordingly, these assets have been included in the quantitative information above. During fiscal 2021, the Board of Trustees designated $100,000 from net assets without donor restrictions to be used to support Cincinnati Children's community p illar of the Pursuing Our Potential Together strategic plan. Cincinnati Children's has other assets limited to use for professional liability, self -insurance health care and debt service, as well as perpetual endowments with donor restrictions. These assets limited to use, which are more fully described in Notes 4 and 6, are not available for general expenditure within the next year and are not reflected in the amounts above. Cincinnati Children's has $186,302 in outstanding obligations for which liquid funds must be available for payment in the event of a failed remarketing. Cincinnati Children's maintains certain balances in cash and investments and has access to a $100,000 line of credit, as discussed in more detail in Note 9. Additionally, Cincinna ti Children's is required to maintain certain liquidity ratios as outlined in bond covenants. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, Cincinnati Children's was in compliance with all such covenants. Cincinnati Children's forecasts its future cash flows and monitors liquidity on an ongoing basis. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 16 (3) Reconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash - The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2022 and 2021: 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $293,360 $274,863 Restricted cash included in other long-term assets 8,986 8,039 Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows $302,346 $282,902 (4) Fair Value Measurements - Cincinnati Children's accounts for its assets and liabilities under ASC 820 \"Fair Value Measurements.\" As defined in ASC 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1: Quo ted Prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date for assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, markets in which there are a few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3: Unobservable inputs, developed using Cincinnati Children's estimates and assumptions, which reflect those that the market participants would use. Such inputs are used when lit tle or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. Determining where an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy depends on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measuremen t as a whole. In determining fair value, Cincinnati Children's utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and considers counterparty credit risk in the assessm ent of fair value. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 17 The table below includes the major categorization for financial instruments on the basis of the nature and risk of the investments at June 30, 2022. Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Marketable Securities : U.S. Government and agency securities $ - $328,313 $ - $ 328,313 Foreign bonds - 53,936 - 53,936 Municipal bonds - 16,595 - 16,595 Common stock 227,167 - - 227,167 Corporate obligations - 438,485 - 438,485 Bond mutual funds 24,782 - - 24,782 Total marketable securities measured in the fair value hierarchy 251,949 837,329 - 1,089,278 Full discretion fixed income2 - - - 169,932 251,949 837,329 - 1,259,210 Assets Limited As To Use: Money market mutual funds 9,144 - - 9,144 Common stock 23,131 - - 23,131 32,275 - - 32,275 Deferred Compensation Plans (included in Other Receivables and Other Long -term Assets): Common stock 7,779 - - 7,779 Mutual funds: Money market 1,122 - - 1,122 Equity 663 - - 663 International equity 325 - - 325 Bond 732 - - 732 Lifecycle 3,773 - - 3,773 Variable annuities - 73 - 73 Guaranteed insurance contract - - 763 763 14,394 73 763 15,230 Derivative Investments (included in Other -Long -term Assets): Interest rate swap agreement - 4,421 - 4,421 Total investments at fair value $298,618 $841,823 $763 $1,311,136 2 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet . Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 18 The table below includes the major categorization for financial instruments on the basis of the nature and risk of the investments at June 30, 2021. Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Marketable Securities : U.S. Government and agency securities $ - $370,368 $ - $ 370,368 Foreign bonds - 46,067 - 46,067 Municipal bonds - 9,347 - 9,347 Common stock 239,044 - - 239,044 Corporate obligations - 471,451 - 471,451 Bond mutual funds 25,086 - - 25,086 Total marketable securities measured in the fair value hierarchy 264,130 897,233 - 1,161,363 Full discretion fixed income3 - - - 191,555 264,130 897,233 - 1,352,918 Assets Limited As To Use: Money market mutual funds 9,088 - - 9,088 Common stock 22,162 - - 22,162 31,250 - - 31,250 Deferred Compensation Plans (included in Other Receivables and Other Long -term Assets): Common stock 8,116 - - 8,116 Mutual funds: Money market 1,203 - - 1,203 Equity 950 - - 950 International equity 587 - - 587 Bond 972 - - 972 Lifecycle 3,384 - - 3,384 Variable annuities - 208 - 208 Guaranteed insurance contract - - 469 469 15,212 208 469 15,889 Derivative Investments (included in Other -Long -term Liabilities): Interest rate swap agreement - (2,956) - (2,956) Total investments at fair value $310,592 $894,485 $469 $1,397,101 The valuation methods described below may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although management believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in different fair value measurement at the reporting date. The carrying amount and fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value. Cincinnati Children's uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of common stock and mutual f unds; such items are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 3 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts pr esented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet . Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 19 Cincinnati Children's primarily bases fair value for investments in fixed income securities, including U.S. government securities, municipal bonds and corporate obligations on a calc ulation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate). Consideration is also given to the counterparty credit rating. Such items are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hi erarchy. Cincinnati Children's interest rate swap agreement (Note 14) is a derivative instrument valued using the income approach, which uses market inputs to discount future cash flows to a single present amount based on market expectations. Cincinnati Children's investment in Full Discretion Fixed Income is an investment in a limited liability company whose investment objective is to invest in marketable and non- marketable securities with issue and industry diversification. As set forth in the LLC agr eement, the LLC will dissolve on May 22, 2047, but may dissolve earlier under certain conditions. Any Investing Member may elect to withdraw, in whole or in part from the LLC if the Member notifies of intent to withdraw sixty calendar days in advance. The Full Discretion Fixed Income is measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The guaranteed insurance contract is recorded based on discounted cash flows, which is an approximation of fair value, and is classified as Le vel 3 based on time restrictions for redemption. Activity and transfers into and out of Level 3 and the reasons for those transfers are as follows: 2022 Guaranteed Insurance Contracts Purchases $335 Issues - 2021 Guaranteed Insurance Contracts Purchases $132 Issues - Cincinnati Children's policy is to recognize transfers in and out as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no material transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3. (5) Losses on the Provision of Uncompensated Care - In accordance with its mission and purpose, Cincinnati Children's maintains a policy of providing medically necessary services to pediatric patients wit hin its primary service area regardless of ability to pay. This primary service area has been defined to include the four counties in Ohio, three counties in Kentucky and one county in Indiana that geographically surround Cincinnati. Under certain circumst ances, Cincinnati Children's accepts patients from outside the primary service area regardless of their ability to pay. Cincinnati Children's defines uncompensated care as services rendered to patients whose families' annual income or net worth falls belo w certain minimum standards. As such, losses absorbed by Cincinnati Children's in rendering services to patients who are covered under governmental programs which are designed to aid low -income families (primarily the Medicaid program) are considered uncom pensated care. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 20 The following information summarizes uncompensated care provided during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021: CHARGES 2022 2021 Charges under Medicaid and other entitlement programs $2,320,168 $1,982,947 Charity care not eligible for Medicaid assistance, at established charges 23,405 24,580 Other uncollectible self -pay, at established charges 20,295 19,442 Total Medicaid, charity care and other uncollectible self -pay charges $2,363,868 $2,026,969 COSTS/LOSSES Estimated costs to provide uncompensated care $(1,015,752) $(851,532) Reimbursement from Medicaid programs 714,615 611,230 Losses on the provision of uncompensated care (301,137) (240,302) Funds received from HCAP and tax levy 34,068 31,463 Losses on provision of uncompensated care net of HCAP and tax levy $ (267,069) $(208,839) The 2022 and 2021 cost amounts reflected in the tables above are calculated using cost to charge ratios calculated from preliminary cost reports because the current year cost report is not yet available. Management does not believe the use of preliminary data would have a m aterial impact on the amounts calculated above. (6) Funds in Trust - Cincinnati Children's has certain funds, which are invested and held in trust for various specified purposes. Funds are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in net investment return in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. The amounts of such funds, at carrying value, and the specified purposes for which such funds may be used, are set forth below: June 30, 2022 2021 Self-insurance Funds - Professional liability $ 159 $ 159 Employee health and workers' compensation 140 140 Bond interest and principal escrow funds 8,687 7,740 Endowment funds held in perpetual trust 23,289 23,211 $32,275 $31,250 Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 21 (7) Property and Equipment - Property and equipment consists of the following: June 30, 2022 2021 Land $ 42,208 $ 42,158 improvements and building (1,389,988) Property and net $1,432,608 $1,403,713 (8) Professional Liability - Cincinnati Children's insurance program includes a self -insured retention for losses arising out of healthcare professional liability claims. The current self -insured retention for asserted claims is $10,000 ($25,000 in aggregate). Cincinnati Children's re gularly purchases excess healthcare professional liability insurance on a claims made basis at varying levels. The actuarial present value of expected costs (including incurred, but not reported claims) for the healthcare professional liability program of $25,274 and $22,184 for 2022 and 2021, respectively, has been accrued in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued healthcare professional liability losses have been discounted at a rate of 4% at June 30, 2022 and 2021. The costs of Cincinnat i Children's healthcare professional liability program, including premiums paid for excess re -insurance, legal fees, settlements, judgments, and other administrative costs are included in Supplies, Drugs and Other in the accompanying Consolidated Statement s of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. Accrued losses funding levels are actuarially determined based on management's estimation of potential outstanding loss liabilities, payout patterns, and various other assumptions, and then adjusted to reflect its best estimate of the present value of expected costs for the healthcare professional liability claims. Healthcare professional liability expense was $12,278 and $5,359 for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (dollars in thousands) 22 (9) Debt - Debt at June 30, 2022 and 2021 is summarized as follows: 2022 2021 Series 2018BB commercial paper, variable interest at June 30, 2022), taxable $100,000 $100,000 payable: Series 2014S, 3.0% to 5.0% due through 2034, net of unamortized $1,987 2032, of through 2037 33,914 36,012 Series 2018AA*, variable 52,387 55,627 Series 2019CC, 5.0% due 2049, 2022 - 6,000 Total 1,119,519 1,148,747 Less: Current portion of bonds and notes payable (9,125) (20,385) Commercial paper notes (100,000) (100,000) Bonds payable subject to remarketing, net (86,302) (91,640) Bonds payable and notes payable - long-term $924,092 $936,722 *Denotes variable rate bonds subject to remarketing agreements (a) Bonds Payable - Cincinnati Children's has pledged gross revenues to secure the payment 2014T, Children's is bound by certain financial covenants included in the bond indentures, direct placeme nt agreements, and related agreements, including a requirement to maintain a minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio.

If the bonds are not remarketed, Cincinnati Children's must repay the bonds. The 2018Z and 2018AA bonds are classified as current liabilities in bonds payable subject to remarketing, net in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The interest ra tes on the 2018Z and 2018AA variable rate bonds are reset weekly by a rate -setting agent. (b) Commercial Paper - The Series 2018BB taxable commercial paper was issued in the original aggregate principal amount of $100,000 and outstanding at any one time in a principal amount not to exceed $100,000.

The line of credit agreement was amended in June 2021 to extend the maturity date to June 2024. The line of credit bears interest at the greater of the Daily Reset LIBOR Rate or 0.50%, plus 50 basis points. In the event LIBOR is no longer available, the line of credit bears interest at the daily SOFR rate, plus an adjustment spread. There were no draws on the line of credit during fiscal year 2 022 or 2021. (10) Employee Benefit Plans - Cincinnati Children's maintains non -contributory retirement plans covering substantially all employees. Among these plans is a defined benefit plan where benefits are based on a formula which reflects years of service and salary levels. Cincinnati Children's funding policy for its defined benefit plan meets the funding standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Cincinnati Children's investment strategy with respec t to pension assets is designed to achieve a moderate level of overall portfolio risk in keeping with desired risk objective, which is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial condition. Cin cinnati Children's adopted an Investment Policy that adjusts allocations between return- seeking assets and liability -hedging assets based on the funded status of the Plan and prevailing yields. As the funded ratio improves, allocations to liability- hedging assets increase accordingly. Cincinnati Children's seeks to maintain diversified portfolios and has adopted allocation targets within the return- seeking and liability hedging portfolios as follows: Return -Seeking Allocation: Min - Target -Max Global Equity - - 80% Private Equity 5% - 10% 15% Real 5% Multi Credit 0% 10% -Hedging Allocation: Long Credit 50% - 75% - 100% STRIPS (Long Duration Treasury Instruments) 0% - 25% - 50% In order to maintain the portfolio's actual asset allocation in line with the target allocations specified above, rebalancing will occur periodically. As of June 30, 2022, Cincinnati Children's has made $126,400 in funding commitments in eleven investment partnerships of which $106,700 has been funded. Additionally, Cincinnati Children's has made $82,500 in funding commitments in ten real estate investment partnerships of which $78,000 has been funded. It is anticipated that these commitments will be funded from liquid investments of the plan.

The fair value for investments in fixed income securities, including U.S. government securities and corporate obligations, is based on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and considers the counterparty credit rating. Such items are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Investments in partnerships - U.S. equities, real estate, and bonds - are valued using the net asset value reported by the managers of the funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. The investments in investment partnerships generally are associated with liquidation restrictions that may range from 91 days to the life of the fund (up to fifteen years) and may require redemption penalties. Commingled investment funds are private funds for institutional investors valued at net asset value. The commingled funds primarily invest in actively traded equity mutual funds, bond mutual funds, and US Treasury STRIPS w ith daily liquidity and no lockup period. There were no transfers between levels in fiscal year 2022 or fiscal year 2021.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation \u2014 The accompanying Supplemental Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (the \"Schedule\") includes the federal grant activity of Cincinnati Children's under programs of the federal government for the year ended June 30, 2022 and is presented on the accrual basis of accounting. This is consistent with the basis of accounting used in the preparation of the basic consolidated financial statements. The information in this Schedule is presented in accordance with the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Guidance . Because the Schedule presents only a selected portion of the operations of Cincinnati Children's, it is not intended to and does not present the financial position, changes in net assets or cash flows of Cincinnati Children's. Net Asset Balances \u2014 Negative amounts represent grants with deficit balances which were closed during fiscal 2022. 2. DE MINIM IS COST RATE Cincinnati Children's did not elect to use the 10% de minimis indirect cost rate as allowed under the Uniform Guidance. 3. SCOPE OF AUDIT All federal grant operations of Cincinnati Children's are included in the scope of Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) . Single audits under the Uniform Guidance are performed in accordance with the provisions of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)'s Compliance Supplement for Single Audits of Higher Learning Institutions and other Non- Profit Institutions (the \"Compliance Supp lement\"). The Department of Health and Human Services has been designated as Cincinnati Children's cognizant agency for the Single audit. 4. PROVIDER RELIEF FUND TAX IDENTIFCATION NUMBER Cincinnati Children's received COVID -19 Provider Relief funds under the 31- 0833936 tax identification number only. 45 REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT To the Board of Trustees of Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Cincinnati, Ohio We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits containe d in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the consolidated financial statements of Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates (the \"Company\") , which comprise the Company's consolidated statement of financial position as of June 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of activities, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated September 30, 2022. Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the Company's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. Deloitte & Touche LLP 50 W 5th Street Suite 200 Cincinnati, OH 45202- www.deloitte.com 46 Report on Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Company's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be report ed under Government Auditing Standards . Purpose of This Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Govern ment Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose. September 30, 2022 47 REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM; REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AND REPORT ON SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT To the Board of Trustees Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Cincinnati, Ohio Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program Opinion on Each Major Federal Program We have audited Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates (the \"Company's\") compliance with the types of compliance requirements identified as subject to audit in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the Company 's major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2022. The Company's ma jor federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. In our opinion, the Company complied, in all material respects, with the com pliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2022. Basis for Opinion on Each Major Federal Program We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS); the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States ( Government Auditing Standards ); and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Our responsibilities under those standards and the Uniform Guidance are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other eth ical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the Company's compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above. Responsibilities of Management for Compliance Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the Company's federal programs. Deloitte & Touche LLP 50 W 5th Street Suite 200 Cincinnati, OH 45202- 48 Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the Company's compliance based on our audit. Reason able assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards , and the Uniform Guidance will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, inten tional omission s, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material, if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggre gate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the Company's compliance with the requirements of each major federal program as a whole. In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards , and the Uniform Guidance, we: Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the Company's compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Obtain an understanding of the Company's internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit. Report on Internal Control Over Compliance A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compli ance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance sec tion above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not 49 identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weak nesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified. Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

Our audit was performed for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole . The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of the financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such informa tion directly to the underl ying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
