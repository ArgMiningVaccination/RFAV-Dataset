A total of 600 1-d- old male broiler chicks were randomly assigned into 5 treatments with 4 replicate pens per treatment (30 birds/replicate pen) for 4 wk. A corn-soybean meal basal diet (control) was for-mulated, and Chlorella (FLC) were added to the basal diet to form 5 dietary treatments. No significant differences were found among the treatments for feed intake or feed conversion of broiler chickens during the whole experimental period, but the BW gain was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in AGP and Chlo- rella-supplemented groups compared with the control group. The number of white blood cells was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in broilers fed FLC compared with DCP, and the number of lymphocytes was also significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the FLC treatment compared with AGP and DCP treatments; however, supplemental AGP and Chlorella had no effect on other blood leucocytes of broiler chickens. Dietary supplementation of Chlorella significantly (P < 0.05) increased the plasma IgA concentration of chickens compared with AGP and control. In addition, plasma IgM concentration was higher in DCP and FLC treatments than the control treatment, and plasma IgG concentration was also higher in the FLC treatment compared with other treatments. Supplemental AGP and various forms of Chlorella did not affect the Esche-richia coli and Salmonella concentration in the intestinal microflora of broiler chickens, but the population of Lactobacillus was significantly increased (P < 0.05) when birds were fed FLC. It is concluded that dietary supplementation of FLC improves BW gain, immune characteristics, and the production of Lactobacillus bacteria in the intestinal microflora of broiler chickens.

However, there is a growing concern about the potential use of antibiotics in livestock feeds due to increased number of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in human and animals [3, 4]. This concern is also increasing due to the potential misuse of antibiotics in animal feeds. Furthermore, the emergence of antibiotic resis-tance has been suggested to be directly related to the amount of antibiotics in the environment [1]. Because of these circumstances, the inclusion of antibiotics in the diets of animal has been pro-hibited in the EU countries since January 2006. Very recently, a full ban of the use of antibiotic growth promoter (AGP) in animal feed came into effect in Korea in July 2011 to ensure the safety of livestock products for consumers [5]. Therefore, it is necessary to find effective alter - natives to antibiotic feed ingredients as prophy-lactic antibacterial and growth promoters [6, 7], especially after the recent ban of antibiotic use as growth promoters in Korea. The application of a wide range of plant ex- tracts, especially sea plants and other natural substances, to enhance animal health and per - formance has been documented for a long time due to their antiinflammatory, immunomodula - tory [8], antioxidant, and antibacterial activities [10] reported that extract activated the macrophages and increased the proinflammatory cytokine production of labora-tory animals. However, huge numbers of algae species are available that produce novel com-pounds. Among these, Chlorella (Chlorella vul- garis) is an important unicellular green micro - alga that is used for human food, animal feed, bio-fertilizers, bio-fuels, and the development of pharmaceuticals [11, 12]. It provides most of the essential amino acids, minerals, vitamins, chlorophyll, and several bioactive substances [13]. It has been reported that supplementation of Chlorella in human and animal diets per - formed numerous biochemical and physiologi-cal functions, such as growth promotion [14], antioxidant functions [15], and immunomodula-tion [16]. In addition, antimicrobial properties of Chlorella are considered to be an effective alter - native to AGP in the diets to maintain optimum health and productivity of the animal. Research has been conducted to the possibil- ity of using Chlorella in poultry diets [17-20]. The main focus of these studies has been to eval - uate the nutritive values of Chlorella as a source of pigment, protein, and energy for replacement of common feedstuffs. More recently, work has been conducted to study the potential health benefits of Chlorella to improve the growth and productivity of birds by increasing the intestinal microbial population [21]. It is well known that increased beneficial microflora concentration in the intestine of birds may help the host with bet-ter digestion and utilization of feed components. In addition, more beneficial bacterial communi-ties in the intestinal tract are believed to posi-tively affect host welfare, health, and produc-tivity [21, 22]. Thus, we hypothesized that the active substance of Chlorella cell contents may affect the microflora concentration and their ac-tivities in the intestine of birds. Moreover, very limited information is available about the use of Chlorella as an alternative to antibiotic feed supplement to promote growth, immune char - acteristics, and intestinal microbial population of broiler chicken. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the effect of dietary supplementation of Chlorella on the growth per - formance, immune characteristics, and intestinal microflora population of broiler chickens com-pared with an AGP. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chlorella Materials Generally 3 kinds of Chlorella materials are available in the market such as i) dried Chlo- rella powder (DCP), ii) Chlorella growth factor (CGF), and iii) fresh liquid Chlorella (FLC). Chlorella powder is made from pounding dried Chlorella into a fine powder, which makes it easy to use in the feed. The CGF is a nucleotide-peptide complex derived from a hot water ex-tract of fresh Chlorella. It is very rich in nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), amino acids, peptides, vitamins, minerals, polysaccharides, glycopro-teins, and -glucans. The FLC is fresh Chlorella that was directly supplied in the feed from the Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/japr/article-abstract/22/1/100/683164 by guest on 05 March 2019 102 JAPR: Research Report pond without any processing or modification. The DCP, CGF, and FLC were collected from a local company [23], where it had been made with Chlorella vulgaris cultivated using an ad- vanced heterotrophic cultivation method (closed pure tank cultivation). Analyzed nutritional composition of DCP by AOAC International [24] is presented in Table 1. Experimental Design, Birds, and Diets A total of six hundred 1-d-old male broiler chicks (Ross \u00d7 Ross) were randomly assigned into 5 dietary treatments with 4 replicate pens (30 birds/replicate pen). A corn-soybean meal basal diet (control) was formulated, and 0.1% virginiamycin, basal diet to form 5 di-etary treatments. The basal diet was formulated to meet the NRC requirements [25] and was fed during the experiment in 2 phases, wk 0 to 3 and wk 4 to 5 (Table 2). All birds were raised in a rice hull-littered floor pens (0.093 m 2/bird) in an environmentally controlled room. Continuous lighting was provided throughout the experi-mental period. The initial room temperature was 32\u00b0C, and reduced by 3\u00b0C each week until 35 d of age. Birds were allowed free access to feed and water throughout the feeding period. All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Welfare Committee of the National Institute of Animal Science, Rural Development Admin-istration, Republic of Korea. Growth Performance The BW gain and feed intake were measured weekly by pen. Feed conversion was calculat- ed as the feed to gain ratio. The BW gain, feed intake, and feed conversion were corrected for dead birds. Sample Collection At the termination of the feeding trial, 2 birds from each pen, close to the mean BW, were se- lected and killed by cervical dislocation. Imme - Table 1.

The gastrointestinal tract was removed from the carcasses, 10-cm segments of both ceca were dissected, and approximately 1 g of cecal content was aseptically collected into a 2-mL safe-lock Eppendorf tube (PCR clean, colorless, package of 1,000). The cecal contents were im-mediately frozen at 40\u00b0C to use for the mea - surement of microflora population. Analyses of Blood Samples In the hematology laboratory, blood samples were centrifuged at 2,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 20 min to separate the plasma and were stored at 15\u00b0C until measurement of plasma composition. The blood leucocytes were measured using an au-tomatic blood analyzer [27]. The plasma IgA, IgG, and IgM were measured using Chicken Ig ELISA Quantitation Kits [28] as described by Mockett and Rose [29]. Measurement of Intestinal Microflora Population One gram of the composite cecal sample from each pen was diluted with 9 mL of 0.9% saline solution and mixed on a vortex. Viable counts of bacteria in the cecal samples were then conducted by plating serial 10-fold dilutions (in 1% peptone solution) into the Lactobacillus , Escherichia coli , and Salmonella, respectively. The Lactobacilli de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar plates were then incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C under anaerobic conditions. The agar plates and Sallmonella agar plates were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C under aerobic condition. The Lactobacillus , E. coli, and Salmonella colonies were counted im- mediately after removal from the incubator [31]. Statistical Analysis Data were subjected to 1-way ANOV A using the GLM procedure of the Statistical Analysis System [32]. Pen means were used as the ex-perimental units for all variables evaluated. The mean differences were compared using Dun-can's multiple range tests. Significance was de-clared when the probability was less than 5% (P < 0.05). RESULTS Growth Performance No significant differences were found among the treatments for feed intake and feed conver - sion of broiler chickens during the experimental period, but the BW gain was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in AGP- and Chlorella -supplemented groups than those of the control group (Table 3). Blood Analysis The number of white blood cells (WBC) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in broilers fed FLC compared with DCP, and the number of lymphocytes was also significantly higher (P < 0.05) in FLC compared with AGP and DCP; however, supplemental AGP and Chlorella had no effect on other blood leucocytes of broiler chickens (Table 4). Dietary supplementation of Chlorella significantly (P < 0.05) increased the plasma IgA concentration of chicks compared Table 3.

In addition, plasma IgM concentration was higher in DCP and FLC than the control, and plasma IgG concentration was also higher in FLC compared with other treat - ments (Table 5). Microbial Population Supplemental AGP and various forms of Chlorella did not affect the E. coli and Sal- monella population in the cecal microflora of broiler chicks, but the population of Lactobacil-lus was significantly increased (P < 0.05) when birds were fed FLC (Table 6). DISCUSSION Chlorella is an important unicellular green microalga that contains more than 60% protein including most of the essential amino acids and bioactive compounds such as Chlorella growth factor for humans and animals [11, 13]. It also contains several micronutrients, fibers, polyun-saturated fatty acids, and a lot of natural pig-ment. The potential nutritive values of Chlorella have been shown to affect some biochemical and physiological functions, such as enhancing immune function [33, 34] and the growth rate of animals [14]. Peiretti and Meineri [35] reported that final BW, weight gain, and feed efficiency were not affected by dietary supplementation of microalgae at different levels in the rabbit diet. Similar to this report, Takekoshi et al. [36] indi-cated that dietary supplementation of Chlorella (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) did not affect the feed intake and weight gain of mice. In addition, Kotrb\u00e1cek et al. [37] concluded that combination of Chlorella with other biological feed additives did not affect the live weight of broilers. How-ever, dietary Chlorella supplementation signifi- cantly increased the BW gain of broiler chickens in the present study, which is not consistent with the previous reports in rabbits [35], mice [36], and broilers [37]. The increased growth perfor - mance of broiler chickens might be attributed to the high amount and high quality of protein in Table 4.

In addition, supplementing 1% of the diet with Chlorella product contains a huge amount of protein, which will increase the protein content for the group fed Chlorella . On the other hand, it has been documented that virginiamycin is used as an AGP in the livestock feed industry for disease prevention and to ac-celerate the growth of the animals [39, 40]. In the present experiment, we also found that BW gain of broilers was significantly increased when birds were fed AGP compared with the control. The similar improvement in BW gain of broilers observed from Chlorella and from the AGP supplementation indicates that dietary Chlorella can be used as an alternative to AGP in the diets for the normal growth performance of broiler chickens. In the current study, the total blood leucocytes of broiler chickens were not affected by dietary Chlorella supplementation compared with the control. In contrast to our results, An et al. [41] reported that total protein, albumin, glucose, and interferon- were increased in blood serum of mice fed hot water extract of Chlorella . They suggested that this extract may be useful in im-proving the immune function of animals. Simi-larly, Kotrb\u00e1cek et al. [37] reported that 0.5% biomass of fresh water Chlorella significantly enhanced the phagocytic activity of leucocytes and lymphatic tissue development of broiler chickens. Therefore, our blood leucocytes re-sults were not consistent with the report of An et al. [41] and Kotrb\u00e1cek et al. [37]. However, the numbers of WBC and lymphocytes were sig-nificantly higher in broilers fed FLC compared with DCP in the present study, maybe due to the processing technique and the nutritional value of Chlorella forms [42, 43].Many microalgae, particularly B 12, and -glucan, an immunoregulatory polysaccharide component that plays a vital role in the body immune functions and inflammatory processes [44-46]. Gamma-interferon is a pro-tein produced by immune cells and protects the body from infections. Chlorella stimulates the activity of immune cells and macrophages by increasing interferon levels, thus enhancing the ability of the immune system to combat patho-gens and foreign proteins. It has been shown that dietary Chlorella supplementation enhances the immune system in humans and animals [16, 47, 48]. In a human study, Nakano et al. [49] reported that dietary Chlorella supplementation to pregnant women significantly increased IgA concentration in breast milk, which was consid-ered to reduce the risk of infection in nursing infants. In the present experiment, the level of plasma immunoglobulin (IgA, IgM, and IgG) significantly increased when broiler chickens were fed various forms of Chlorella . Previous reports have shown that dietary fiber and veg-etable proteins from plant sources enhance IgA production in the mesenteric lymphocytes [50, 51]. Therefore, it was assumed that the fiber and protein peptides contained in the Chlorella stim- ulate immunoglobulin, producing B cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and increase the IgA, IgM, and IgG concentration in the plasma of broiler chickens. In addition, immurella, a polysaccharide compound in the Chlorella cells, is also an important factor to enhance the im-mune response of broilers fed Chlorella-supple-mental diets [44, 52]. In the current study, it was also found that the plasma IgA concentration of chicks was sig-nificantly higher in the Chlorella supplemental Table 6.

A novel glycoprotein obtained from fresh Chlorella vul-garis showed antimetastatic immunopotentia - tion, maybe a reason for this improvement [53]. In addition, the multicomponent dietary supple-mental action of Chlorella may enhance the mu-cosal immune characteristics of birds fed FLC [54]. Actually, the immune system is exceeding-ly complex, and although many of the measures in our study are relevant, they do not allow us to categorically state that the Chlorella products are effective replacements for AGP. Therefore, further research is warranted in detail relevant to gut immune system by including Chlorella products in the chicken diet. Numerous microalgae products and by prod- ucts have been used as useful natural antimicro - bials due to its potential antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activities [55, 56]. These activi - ties depend upon the technological process, nu-trient concentration in the algal mass, and the production technique [43, 57]. It is well docu-mented that a significant number of beneficial microorganisms in the intestinal tract are help-ful for the host in the digestion and absorption of feed nutrients. Janczyk et al. [21] reported that feeding Chlorella vulgaris significantly increased the lactobacilli diversity in crop and ceca of laying hens with a stronger effect on the cecal bacterial population. In the present experiment, dietary Chlorella supplementation did not affect the E. coli and Salmonella pop- ulation in the ceca of broiler chicks; however, the Lactobacillus population was significantly higher when birds were fed FLC. The higher number of beneficial bacterial communities in the intestinal tract is believed to positively af-fect host welfare and health, which support the immune response of broiler chickens fed FLC in this study (Table 6). The improved response on microbial community of the intestine might be attributed to the high nutrient concentration of cell wall of fresh Chlorella . In addition, a large amount of chlorophyll and fibrous cell walls in Chlorella is an important factor to increase the beneficial lactic acid bacteria in the gut of the broiler chicks. In this study, FLC was provided to the experimental birds without applying any processing techniques. Naturally, FLC contains all nutrients including vitamins, minerals, fiber, chlorophylls, and chlorellin. Chlorellin fights only against pathogenic organisms without de-stroying beneficial microflora in the intestine, which in turn has the ability to improve the health and productivity of broiler chickens [58]. Therefore, the result observed in this study sup-ports the report of Janczyk et al. [21], who noted that increased productivity and egg quality were found in the laying hens fed up to 7.5 g/kg of Chlorella . On the other hand, it was assumed that more microalgal cell components would be released with better destruction of its cell wall by the different processing techniques [59, 60]. In ad-dition, CGF, the most powerful constituent of Chlorella , works as a probiotic that enhances the growth and quality of intestinal microflora life [61]. However, our results are not in agree-ment with these hypotheses because we did not observe any significant change on the microbial community of broiler chicks fed DCP and CGF. Similarly, in a layer study, Janczyk et al. [21] showed no effect of the technological process-ing of microalgae on the microbial diversity of the intestinal tract. Therefore, the nutrient con-centration of the Chlorella cell wall is an impor - tant factor to increase the Lactobacillus popula- tion in the intestinal tract of the broiler chickens. CONCLUSIONS AND APPLICATIONS 1. Dietary supplementation of FLC im- proves BW gain, immune characteris - tics, and the production of Lactobacillus bacteria in the intestinal microflora of broiler chickens. 2. The inclusion of up to 1% of FLC in the conventional diets of young broiler chicks might improve the development of the digestive tract and growth perfor - mance. 3. It may be beneficial to supplement the diets of broiler chickens with FLC in the absence of AGP. REFERENCES AND NOTES 1. Barton, M. D. 2000.
