Evidence exists of this practice as far back as the Ancient Chinese, Egyptians, Greeks, Indians and Romans. These civilisations all used [essential oils](/collections/essential-oils) for their immune systems because they noticed their effectiveness for certain ailments. This type of treatment is once more gaining traction in the modern day, with a global surge in interest occurring because we're rediscovering that Mother Nature usually does know best! Essential oils are made up of many different components, and [researchers are increasingly proving](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309671/) that many immune boost essential oil blends work like our ancestors believed them to. Clinical trials, research and studies have backed this up, so even science says that Mother Nature has the power to boost our immunity! 5 essential oils for an immune system boost If your immune system needs a boost, these are the top 5 essential oils you should try: 1. Eucalyptus [Research has revealed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23570005/) that eucalyptus oil's antimicrobial activity makes it a powerful remedy against Escherichia coli, the bacteria responsible for diarrhoea and urinary tract infections, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus, a common bacteria found on the skin. Studies have also indicated that eucalyptus oil can enhance the [phagocytosis](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2374764/#sec-13title) process whereby immune cells engulf germs, removing them from your system. Eucalyptus oil may also help [purify the air](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6060867/) because of its antifungal properties. Using it in your diffuser will help clear the fungus and mould found in the indoor air coming into your home or office through air vents. Find an immune booster essential oil diffuser recipe that contains eucalyptus oil and you'll be able to enjoy a more hygienic space. Popular for pain relief because of its analgesic properties, [eucalyptus essential oil](/products/eucalyptus-essential-oil) has long been known for its anti-inflammatory effects and its ability to ameliorate respiratory conditions. The oil from this plant is used extensively nowadays, appearing in cleaning products, healing ointments, perfumes, shower gels and vapour rubs. This is why using eucalyptus essential oil for your immune system is so highly recommended. Did you know? Australia's unofficial national anthem, the 1995 folk ballad Waltzing Matilda, references the coolibah tree, also known as eucalyptus. 2. Lemon [Lemon essential oil's](/products/lemon-essential-oil) major constituents include -pinene, d-limonene and -terpinene, all of which make it such a powerful antioxidant. Its other carotenes, coumarins, flavonoids and terpenes may also contribute to this activity. Lemon oil can escalate the [body's production of white blood cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6943609/). These blood cells are how we defend and protect ourselves from infections and foreign substances, so it's a great tool for strengthening your immune system. Lemon oil can also function as a diuretic and antiseptic and may even be able to mitigate the symptoms of depression in some people. Its ability to improve your mood and ability to concentrate and promote emotional balance and mental relaxation are why lemon oil is on this list. Its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial functions make it an excellent option for your skin too. After it's been properly diluted, topical application of lemon essential oil can tackle the bacteria that builds up in our pores, causing breakouts. It may also [inhibit elastase](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17147537/), the enzyme that breaks down your skin elastin and makes you wrinkle as you age! Create an immune boost essential oil blend using [grapefruit essential oil](/products/grapefruit-essential-oil), lemon, tangerine and/or juniper berry. Did you know? It takes 3,000 lemon rinds to produce just over 2 pounds of essential oil through cold pressing. 3. Volant's Immuno-Boost One-Stop Shop We've nicknamed our [Citrus Boost Set](/products/citrus-boost) the 'cocktail of joy' because that's what it's been designed to deliver. It features a range of olfactory favourites including sweet orange, grapefruit and lemon oils, along with our best-selling [Organic Energy Blend](/products/organic-energy). This combines the crisp citrus fragrances of amyris, bergamot, grapefruit and lime. A [2012 clinical study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3521421/) revealed that participants who inhaled citrus essential oils experienced positive results, with lowered blood pressure and stress levels. This bolstered results from [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8646568/) undertaken in 1995 where people with a depressive disorder were exposed to a citrus fragrance created by mingling lemon, orange and bergamot essential oils. It showed that 12 individuals suffering from major depressive disorder required significantly lower doses of antidepressants between 4 and 11 weeks. Since mood and stress are closely related to immune function, enhancing your mood and lowering your stress can help boost your immune system, and that's what the science shows. Did you know? Due to the fresh and zingy scent of citrus, it's often referred to as 'liquid sunshine'. However, sun and citrus don't mix well. People who eat citrus fruits in the sun and get the juices on them can end up with phytophotodermatitis, a skin sensitivity condition that's sun-induced. 4. Rosemary In a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25002023/) that saw scientists administering [rosemary essential oil](/products/organic-rosemary-essential-oil) to mice, evidence emerged of its ability to prevent liver damage. This is due to its high levels of antioxidants, present in the chemical compounds found in rosemary like camphor, 1,8-cineole and -pinene. This same study demonstrated that rosemary oil can also neutralise free radicals, lessening the damage our exposure to them can cause. Liver health is closely linked to immunity because your liver's job is to clean your blood and get rid of toxins. If your system can't properly eliminate the bad, it will get overloaded, compromising your immunity. Using rosemary oil in aromatherapy can help fight fatigue, nervous tension and stress. It can also boost your level of [mental activity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23833718/) while encouraging insight and clarity. It's one of the most popular essential oils in the world for eliminating a negative frame of mind, improving alertness, improving how well we retain information, and enhancing our ability to concentrate. Rosemary oil's scent can also work as an appetite stimulant, and it has been shown to reduce the quantity of [stress hormones](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17291597/) released into the body during tense experiences. And we know that reducing your stress boosts your immunity! Use rosemary alongside basil, [cedarwood essential oil](/products/organic-cedarwood-essential-oil), ginger, lime or mandarin for a powerful immune boost essential oil blend. Did you know? According to Greek mythology, Aphrodite, the goddess of love, rose from the sea draped with rosemary. This is why this plant still plays such a big role in Greek weddings to this day. Brides may wear a wreath containing rosemary, and the newly married couple give each of their guests a sprig. 5. Clove Clove essential oil has proven to have [multiple capabilities](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17380552/) for immune support. These include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities. Phenylpropanoids are one of the main components of clove oil, made up of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, eugenol and thymol. These, along with compounds like flavonoids and terpenes, are excellent for our immune systems. Using clove essential oil for an immune system boost allows it to do its work as an anti-inflammatory, an antiviral and an expectorant, all of which help our immune systems to fight infectious agents. The oil can also help reduce the presence of [respiratory pathogens](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30053847/) in the air when diffused, helping to keep you from getting sick in the first place! From toothache to candida, the high concentration of antioxidants in clove oil means it can be very effective for treating a range of conditions. It's a good remedy for [acne](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28124400/), can lower your risk of catching a cold and help speed up your recovery if you're already sick. Use it as part of essential oil blends for the immune system by mixing it with cassia, fennel, [frankincense essential oil](/products/frankincense-essential-oil), Roman chamomile and wild orange. Did you know? One ounce of clove oil has the same antioxidant power as 48 gallons of beetroot juice, 120 quarts of blueberries and 450 pounds of carrots! How to use essential oils for immune system assistance A good way to decide which oils work best for you is to start small, experimenting with the various ways of using them and taking careful note of how your body reacts to each one. Remember to always [dilute essential oils](/blogs/guides/5-best-tips-for-diluting-your-essential-oils) before they come into contact with your skin. A good ratio is 15 drops of essential oil to 2 tablespoons of [carrier oil](/collections/carrier-oils). Doing this will ensure your skin doesn't get irritated by the potent plant extracts in their concentrated form. Pick from the essential oils we've recommended if you'd like to boost your body's defence, and use them in any of the following ways: Aromatherapy massage For a generalised massage to boost your immune system, massage your diluted essential oil mix into your [pulse points](/blogs/guides/pulse-points-for-essential-oils). This list includes the place behind your ears as well as the points on your chest, neck, temples and wrists. Bathing Dilute 5 drops of essential oil with 2 teaspoons of carrier oil and add the mix to your bath. There are many [essential oil blends](/collections/essential-oil-blends) for immune system health that you can choose from to gain various benefits. Diffusion Use 10 drops of oil per 100 ml of water in your [diffuser](/collections/diffusers) and transform your everyday environment into one that actively supports your immune system. There are many immune booster essential oil diffuser recipes to choose from in this category. Linen mists and room sprays You can create your own mists and sprays using essential oils, witch hazel and distilled water. Pour between 25 and 30 drops of essential oil into your spray bottle, fill it up halfway with witch hazel and then add water. Or, [purchase one](/collections/essential-oil-mists) you like which contains the oils you're looking for. Diffusion or iInhalation Diffusing essential oils is the easiest way to gain the mood-boosting benefits of their health-giving and delicious scents. This in turn affects your stress levels and ultimately your immune system function. This is also the best way to purify the air in your space or home to kill germs floating around in the air. Alternatively, you can use an inhaler to breathe in the scent of essential oils directly or add a few drops to a cotton ball and put these around your room or in your car vents. Just be sure not to let the concentrated oils come into contact with your skin. The benefits of using essential oils for immune system support It's safe to say that, as long as you use them responsibly, essential oils can do a lot for your physical, mental and emotional health. An important fact to remember is that you need to ensure that you only use high quality, all natural, organic essential oils like the ones you can find at [Volant](https://volantaroma.com). Many substances touted as essential oils have been created using artificial or diluted oils and harsh chemicals. Naturally, these will not have the same positive effects as their pure counterparts and may even turn out to be toxic. We are much more aware nowadays of how important good health is and what kinds of risks we run when we jeopardise our immune systems. More people are working to reduce their health risks and improve their conditions, and essential oil blends for the immune system can be a powerful tool in your arsenal. Give your immune system a helping hand As serious as the consequences of having a weakened immune system can be, there is good news! A few basic changes to your lifestyle can make a huge difference, and using essential oils for the immune system can be very effective in restoring your body's balance. Let Volant's essential oils help strengthen your immune system, and you'll enjoy all the benefits of better health in so many ways. "}
