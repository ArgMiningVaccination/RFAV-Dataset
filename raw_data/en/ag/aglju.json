The vaccine will now be marketed to individuals 16 and older under the brand name COMIRNATY (Koe-mir-na-tee).

The analysis studied 20,000 individuals who received the vaccine and 20,000 individuals who received a placebo and found that the vaccine is 91 percent effective in preventing COVID-19. The FDA found the most common side effects to be pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. The FDA did find that the vaccine does present a higher risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in males under the age of 40, the highest risk being for males ages 12 to 17. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is inflammation of the outside lining of the heart. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and a fast-beating heart. Individuals with symptoms should seek medical attention. The FDA is requiring Pfizer to continue post-marketing studies.
