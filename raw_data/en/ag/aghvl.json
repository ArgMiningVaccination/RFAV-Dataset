Dr. Henry Cheng: Homeopathics can be used to complement vaccination. A weekly dose of Influenzinum 9CH and a weekly dose of Thymuline 9CH for 5 weeks may enhance the protection. For people who are concerned about side effects of vaccination, a dose of Sulfur 30CH before and another dose after vaccination may help to minimize the risk of side effects. If side effects do occur, a dose of Thuya 30CH or Antimomium Tart 30CH will alleviate the symptoms.
