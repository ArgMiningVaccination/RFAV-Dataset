If you have received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines and six months or more have passed since your second dose, you are eligible for a booster dose. If you have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and two months or more have passed since your dose, you are eligible for a booster dose. Boosters are recommended for individuals working in educational settings, working in health care settings, or living in congregate living situations (residence halls, housing arrangements with multiple residents in close contact), and other environments common in the USC community. [USC Pharmacies](https://pharmacies.usc.edu/covidvaccine/) offer campus vaccination; [MyTurn](https://myturn.ca.gov/) provides appointments at retailers across California. You may choose to receive any vaccine as your booster.
