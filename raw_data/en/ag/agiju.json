Two years later he founded Zion's Watch Tower and Tract Society, which was incorpo-rated in 1884 in Pennsylvania. Within ten years, asmall Bible study group had evolved into scores ofcongregations. In 1909 the society moved itsheadquarters to Brooklyn, New York, where itremains today. The name Jehovah's Witnesses wasadopted in 1931 (Watch Tower Bible and TractSociety Pennsylvania [hereafter cited as WatchTower Society] 1974: 149-51). Jehovah's Witnesses base their beliefs on the Bible, which they regard as the inspired, inerrant Word ofGod. Their theology includes a doctrine of\"progressive revelation,\" however, which allows theirleaders to change biblical interpretations anddoctrines frequently (Penton 1997: 165-71). Forexample, they long taught that the present \"system ofthings\" would end before all members of the gener-ation alive in 1914 would die. Now, although theyteach that the end, marked by the Battle ofThe Jehovah's Witness Tradition Religious Beliefs and Healthcare Decisions Edited by Edwin R. DuBose Revised by M.

James Penton, Ph.D., is a retired professor of history and religious studies at the University of Lethbridge and a specialist inJehovah's Witnesses.Armageddon, is still imminent, they no longer hold that it must come within the generation of1914 (Penton 1997: 316-17; W atchtower , 1 November 1995, 18, 19). Armageddon will rid the earth of Satan and all his forces. Only Jehovah's Witnesses willsurvive this worldwide conflict, which will resultin a millennium of peace and righteousness,during which billions of dead persons will beresurrected and given a chance to provethemselves worthy of eternal life. During thisperiod an \"anointed\" class of 144,000 saints willrule with Christ in heaven as spiritual beings,while those loyal to Jehovah on earth willgradually regain the perfection had by Adamand Eve before the Fall (Watch Tower Society1995: 182-3). FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS CONCERNING HEALTH CARE In their approach to health, illness, and medical care, Witnesses are determined not to violatewhat they regard as God's standards concerningthe value and meaning of life in all its spiritualand physical aspects (Watch Tower Society 1990:6; Watch Tower Society 1989: 14). From thebeginning of the movement, Witnesses havestressed publishing and preaching above curingphysical and social ills. When the Millenniumarrives, they believe, all problems, includingthose related to health, will be solved. Russell,for example, felt that suffering could beredemptive, that instead of making one rebel-lious, it could refine one's character through the\"blessings of afflictions and sorrows\" and wouldhelp prepare one for the end time (Cumberland1986: 472). Suffering, patiently borne,strengthened character. Russell also believed that disease was a degenerative process that began with Adam's fallfrom grace and would not be reversed until afterArmageddon. He also recognized a psychoso-matic element in illness, asserting that \"one halfof the people in the world are sick because theythink they are.\" In earlier times Witnesses perceived a demonic role in the origin ofdisability and disease (Cumberland 1986: 47-71). In contrast to many Christian denominations, the Witnesses did not create their ownhealthcare institutions. According to the WatchTower Society, they were not to operate hospitalsand clinics; the world's time was \"too short.\"Clayton J. Woodworth, the editor of The Golden Ageand Consolation magazines, was influential in this area: he regarded the American MedicalAssociation as \"an institution founded onignorance, error, and superstition,\" denied thegerm theory of disease, attacked the use ofvaccination as a violation of God's law, andregarded the use of aluminum cookware asdangerous to health (Penton 1997: 66). Sincethe magazines edited by Woodworth were officialWatch Tower publications, most Witnessesbelieved that Woodworth's opinions representedofficial positions of the Society (Cumberland1986: 473). Jehovah's Witnesses no longer holdsuch views, and in recent years they have showna much more positive attitude toward modernscience and the medical profession. Although the Witnesses' rejection of blood transfusions is well known, many healthcareproviders have little knowledge of the widercontext of their views concerning health and illness. The Governing Body of Jehovah'sWitnesses has therefore encouraged the formation of hospital liaison committees inmajor cities with large medical institutions. By 1992, over one hundred committees existedin major cities in the United States to improveunderstanding between providers and theWitness community ( Awake! 22 November 1990, 21; Kingdom Ministry , September 1992, 3-5). In recent years Witnesses have generallysought and accepted qualified professionalhealth care within religious parameters such asrefusal of blood transfusions (Tabbert 1992: 2).The majority rely on biomedical science andtrained medical personnel for their health care(Watch Tower Society 1977: 27). 2 THEJEHOVAH 'SWITNESS TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISION SJehovah's Witnesses are committed to the Bible as a source of ethical values for allhumankind. Scripture is used as a guide for allaspects of life (including, for example, diet andhygiene). It also serves as the source of moralprinciples and ethical norms that have beenpassed down and followed through thecenturies. The way in which people respond tothese principles reveals a fundamental orien-tation to life. Ethical analysis is done throughreading and applying Scripture; because theBible does not comment directly on organ trans-plants, for example, decisions about transplantsare left to the individual Witness ( W atchtower , 15 March 1980, 31), although, curiously, formany years such transplants were regarded as aform of cannibalism Because bonemarrow transplants may contain blood,Witnesses are cautioned that it may be wrong toaccept them ( W atchtower , 15 May 1984, 31). INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE In their organization the Jehovah's Witnesses follow what is said to be the pattern of theChristian congregation of the first century. Sincethe early 1970s, they have been directed by aGoverning Body, which determines doctrinal,legislative and judicial matters for them. TheGoverning Body consists of a small group ofelderly men who hope to join Christ in heavenas members of the 144,000 of Revelationchapters 7 and 14. Members of the GoverningBody do not consider themselves to be infallible,but all Jehovah's Witnesses are expected to obeytheir dictates on pain of excommunication. TheGoverning Body supervises the Society's publi-cations and appoints a Branch Committee ofthree or more men in each of the 111 branchesof the worldwide movement. These committeesappoint congregational elders and ministerialservants and supervise activities in the morethan two hundred countries in which theWitnesses have a presence (Watch Tower Society 1986: 26-27; 1989: 9; 2002). Each local congregation is governed by elders or overseers who supervise it and look after itsneeds. These elders are not clergy; rather, theysupervise the instruction provided through theWatch Tower Society at meetings, lead inpreaching activities, and visit members toencourage them as needed. Elders also haveresponsibility to reprove and administer disci-pline through \"judicial committees\" to any whomay be following a wrong course and whoendanger the spiritual and moral purity andunity of the congregation. Under variouscircumstances Witnesses may be expelled fromtheir congregations as \"unrepentant wrong-doers,\" a practice known as \"disfellowshipping\"(Watch Tower Society, 1991: 90-100), or theymay simply be held to have \"disassociated\"themselves for such things as joining anotherreligious organization or serving in the armedforces (Watch Tower Society, 1991: 101-2). Theelders are assisted by ministerial servants whoare recommended by the elders; both elders andministerial servants serve voluntarily. Allbaptized members are considered ordainedministers, although only a few serve as full-timeadministrators and \"pioneers,\" or full-timeevangelists (Watch Tower Society 1986: 12-13). Usually 18-25 congregations are grouped in a circuit and assemble twice a year for \"circuitassemblies\" or conventions. Once a year, largerdistrict conventions bring together a number ofcircuits in a program based on the spiritualneeds of Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide withrespect to their preaching work and moralconcerns. Worldwide, Witness congregations are organized to cover their local area systematicallywith the preaching of \"the good news of God'sKingdom\" as presented in the ChristianScriptures. So that such witnessing is done in anorderly fashion, the local branch office of theWatch Tower Society assigns an area to everycongregation. The congregation divides that areainto smaller portions, which are then assigned to 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERmembers who take the responsibility of contacting people with the Witnesses' message. Since World War II the movement has grown rapidly. Active door-to-door \"publishers\" orpreachers worldwide numbered 6,035,564 as ofAugust 2001 (Watch Tower Society 2002).Disappointment associated with the failure ofthe predicted Armageddon to arrive and therigid demands imposed on members by their tradition may have accounted for many of thenearly 1,000,000 desertions from the movementthat occurred during the period from 1970 to1999 (Franz 2000: 34). There are nearly1,000,000 active Jehovah's Witnesses in theUnited States today (Watch Tower Society 2002). Generally Jehovah's Witnesses have goodrelations with healthcare providers and support medical work and practice with theexception of blood therapy and, to a lesserextent, psychiatry. With respect to blood therapy,commonly understood notions of an individual'sautonomy play a negligible role in the moralreasoning of Witnesses. The key moral authorityfor them is not the right of self-determination,as claimed in secular bioethics, but rather theGoverning Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, whichis seen as overseeing Jehovah's channel of truthon earth. The chief standard is obedience to thisauthority. Besides seeking guidance in Scriptureand prayer, adherents often seek counsel fromtheir elders about healthcare matters. CLINICAL ISSUES AND PROCEDURES Self-determination and informed consent Although the Witnesses' stand on blood transfu-sions is dictated by their Governing Body, theyalso recognize the principles of informedconsent and self-determination as pivotal in anydiscussion of clinical issues. 1They accept these principles as their own, take them seriously, anduse them to build the case that a competentpatient has the right to refuse treatment.Because of what the Watch Tower Society, actingon behalf of the Governing Body, has dictatedconcerning blood therapy in recent years, it isdifficult for most Jehovah's Witnesses to know what blood particles they may or may not acceptaccording to the teachings of their faith.Furthermore, they may believe that being givena transfusion, which is still prohibited, is spiri-tually detrimental only if it is accepted volun-tarily. Thus, if the transfusion is taken undercourt order, it may not be regarded in this way(Watson 1991: 10). 2 The competent adult's legal right to refuse medical treatment stems from the constitu-tionally guaranteed right to privacy and, in somecases, freedom of religion. Courts have upheldthe right of the competent Jehovah's Witness torefuse transfusion on religious grounds. When apatient is able to consent, refusal to receiveblood transfusions based on religious beliefsgenerally cannot be overridden when the welfareof the state is not in question. 3The rights of competent patients, however, are not absolute.Generally, when a pregnant woman refusesblood transfusion therapy, thereby jeopardizingthe well-being of the fetus, the state may arguefor a compelling interest sufficient to warrantcompulsory care. Also, the presence ofdependent minor children is usually consideredby courts to be a compelling reason fortreatment of a sick parent. 4 Witnesses are willing to sign the American Medical Association release form relievinghospitals of liability for non-acceptance of trans-fusions, provided that their wishes about blood 4 THEJEHOVAH 'SWITNESS TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISION STHE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIPare respected (Dixon and Smalley 1981: 2472; Watch Tower Society 1977). Many Witnessescarry a MedicAlert card instructing that noblood products be administered; the card,prepared with legal and medical consultation, issigned and dated annually. Whether health insti-tutions are bound legally by these instructions isdebatable because state statutes in this area arelacking (Fontanarosa 1989: 1092;Dixon and Smalley arewell advised to discuss their religious beliefsregarding blood with their regular physiciansand thoroughly document their views in advanceof a clinical situation. Clinicians treatingJehovah's Witnesses should discuss in detail thetypes of blood products and the specific proce-dures with which the individual Witness iscomfortable. Telling the truth and confidentiality The obligations to tell the truth and maintainconfidentiality are commonly seen as integral tothe patient-caregiver relationship. \"The superiordemands of divine law,\" however, might require aJehovah's Witness healthcare worker to breachthe requirements of patient confidentiality topreserve the purity of a Witness congregation byreporting to local elders for discipline a fellowWitness who had broken some Governing Bodyrule. A W atchtower article observes that the Witness healthcare worker may aid an \"apparentsinner\" by taking such action, but also acknowl-edges that employers have a right to expectemployees to preserve confidentiality(W atchtower , 1 September 1987, 12-15). Thus,prior to accepting employment that requires confidentiality, a Witness should consider howallegiance to Scripture might conflict with profes-sional, institutional, and legal requirements. Proxy decision-making and advance directives In cases involving the possibility of blood trans- fusion for a Jehovah's Witness patientconsidered incompetent, a surrogate decisionmaker who best understands the wishes of thepatient should be identified or appointed(Awake! 8 September 1986). The courts have generally applied the doctrine of \"substitutedjudgment\" to determine the appropriate medicaltreatment for incompetent patients: a surrogatedecision maker, focusing on the particulardesires of the patient involved, judges what thepatient would have wanted if he or she hadbeen competent to make the decision(Fontanarosa and Giorgio 1989: 1093). Theadvance medical directive or release commonlyused by Witnesses includes a clause naming andauthorizing a surrogate decision maker.Although no specific Governing Body statementwas found, it seems clear that Jehovah'sWitnesses strongly support proxy decision-making in clinical issues. 5 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERJehovah's Witnesses strongly emphasize tradi- tional family and moral values. Because of the nearness of Armageddon and the desire fortotal commitment to the cause, however, WatchTower leaders for years discouraged membersfrom marrying and, if they did marry, fromhaving children (Penton 1997: 265). In 1951 theGoverning Body changed its position, with someambivalence, to approval of marriages amongWitnesses (Cumberland 1986: 480). Basing theirviews on Scripture, Witnesses believe that ahusband should treat his wife with respect,understanding, and concern, \"giving her specialattention.\" A wife should be a helper to herhusband, \"supporting his decisions and cooper-ating with him to achieve family goals\" (WatchTower Society 1992: 5-6). Although Witness writings commonly assign women to positions subordinate to their husbands,women are encouraged to exercise a degree ofautonomy over their bodies by such means asgiving birth at home, breast-feeding, and usingcontraceptives (Cumberland 1986: 480). Parents should give time, attention, and disci- pline to their children, teaching them rightprinciples according to Scripture. Children areto obey their parents (Watch Tower Society1992: 5-6). In the matter of sexual ethics, the Witnesses agree with the traditional Christian view thatlimits sexual activity to marriage. In addition, theyhold that oral and anal sexual intercourse arewrong, even within marriage. Homosexuality isdenounced in the strongest terms as ungodly andunhealthful ( W atchtower , 15 March 1983, 31).CLINICAL ISSUES AND PROCEDURES Contraception Because birth control is a personal matter, the Governing Body permits with some reservationthe use of contraceptives. Regarding the use ofintrauterine devices, which may cause abortions,each concerned married couple is instructed tomake a conscientious decision in light of aBible-based respect for the sanctity of life andthe Witness opposition to abortion ( W atchtower , 15 May 1979, 31). Sterilization For years the Watch Tower Society opposedvoluntary sterilization, arguing that it violatedthe natural procreative powers provided byJehovah and threatened marital harmony if onemarriage partner later desired a family. In the1980s, in response to the possibility ofsuccessful reversals of sterilization procedures,the Society began treating the issue as a privateand personal matter, arguing that preaching wasmore important than having children(W atchtower , 1 May 1985, 31). More recently, however, the Society seems to have reverted toits earlier stance, holding that individuals whoseek voluntary sterilization (except when a wife'slife may be endangered by pregnancy) may bedenied privileges in Witness congregations(W atchtower , 15 June 1999, 27-28). Abortion and the status of the fetus Abortion is not permitted even when the mother's life is in danger or birth defects seemlikely. For Witnesses life begins at conception;therefore, the age of the embryo or the issue ofa woman's rights is never a factor in deter-mining the morality of abortion ( Awake! 22 August 1975; 8 November 1986; 8 October1990). Abortion is never the answer to the needfor population control or birth control ( Awake! 8 April 1988). 6 THEJEHOVAH 'SWITNESS TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISION SFAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATIONArtificial insemination Artificial insemination by anonymous donor (AID) is viewed as a form of adultery(W atchtower , 15 August 1984, 26). No position on artificial insemination by husband (AIH) was found. Gamete intrauterine fallopian transfer (GIFT) No statement was found on gamete intrauterine fallopian transfer. In vitro fertilization (IVF) A brief discussion that relegates IVF to therealm of personal conscience appeared in a1981 W atchtower article (15 June, 31). Other statements in Watch Tower literature (mostly inAwake! ) suggest a negative attitude toward the procedure. If it is performed to implant anembryo in a prospective surrogate mother, it ismorally wrong according to a 1993 article inAwake! (8 March, 26). Surrogate motherhood Surrogate motherhood is condemned, whether the surrogate mother is impregnated by artificialinsemination or an embryo of a married couple is implanted in her uterus for gestation.According to a 1993 Awake! article, both proce- dures are regarded as a \"violation of themarriage bed\" (8 March, 26). Disease treatment of pregnant women No statement on disease treatment of pregnantwomen was found. The sanction against bloodtransfusions, however, applies to the treatmentof pregnant women. Prenatal diagnosis and treatment No positions were found on prenatal diagnosisand treatment. Care of severely handicapped newborns No position was found on the care of severelyhandicapped newborns. Given the Witnesses'views on the sanctity of human life, however,one may conclude that the tradition would favorcare and support for severely handicappednewborns and their parents. 7 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERGENETICS While recognizing the promise that genetic research holds, Witnesses are concerned about the goals of this research: \"It containsgreat potential for good in the form of betterdrugs, better medical care, and improved under-standing of how living things work,\" but Godhas \"the ultimate authority to decide the geneticblueprints for all living things . . .\" ( Awake! 22 July 1989, 13).CLINICAL ISSUES No explicit positions were found on the issues ofgenetic screening and counseling, sex selection,selective abortion, or gene therapy. Given thetradition's beliefs about the sanctity of life andopposition to abortion, however, one couldconclude that Jehovah's Witnesses opposeselective abortion.MENTAL HEALTH Witness tradition recognizes that physical and psychological pressures are the causes of mental distress ( W atchtower , 1 March 1990, 3-4). Fearful that non-Christian therapistsmay trace the roots of emotional problems totheir patients' peculiar faith, however, leaders ofthe movement at times discouraged Witnessesfrom seeking professional help for mental healthconcerns. They argued that relief fromdepression and anxiety could be found inregular Bible study and congregational meetings,an approach to mental distress that is stillfollowed. In this view, elders in a congregationprovide support for the person throughcounseling that stresses willpower, reassurance,and prayer ( W atchtower , 1 March 1990, 5-9). Leaders now state that when severe distresspersists, elders and family members shouldencourage the person to seek medical attention,particularly from physicians and therapists whounderstand and respect the beliefs of Jehovah'sWitnesses ( W atchtower , 15 October 1988).CLINICAL ISSUES Involuntary commitment No statement was found on involuntary commitment. Psychotherapy and behavior modification Accepting treatment from a psychiatrist orpsychologist is a personal decision to be made with due caution. Some well-intentionedpractitioners fail to understand Christianprinciples and give \"advice that flatly contradicts the Bible\" ( W atchtower , 15 October 1988, 29). Psychopharmacology Witnesses recognize that medically superviseduse of some medications may permit severely illpeople to function normally. Although some\"well-intentioned brothers\" have discouragedpatients from taking prescribed medication,fearing that it will be harmful or addictive,others note that many psychiatric drugs servemerely to correct chemical imbalances in thebrain and that such drug therapy can be viewed 8 THEJEHOVAH 'SWITNESS TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISION SORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATION Witnesses do not believe that the Bible comments directly on organ transplants; hence, decisions about cornea, kidney, or othertransplants must be made by the individualWitness ( W atchtower 15 March Smalley 1981: 2471). The W atchtower has cautioned Witnesses to make sure that bonemarrow transplants do not contain blood(W atchtower , 15 May 1984, 31).CLINICAL ISSUES Issues concerning recipients Because of the potential for HIV infection, organs and tissue from people with AIDS should not be used for transplants ( Awake! 22 November 1986). Issues concerning donors No positions were found on the procurement oforgans or tissue from cadaveric or living donors,or from anencephalic newborns or humanfetuses.9 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERin much the same way as a diabetic's use of insulin. Also, in the face of slow-acting therapiesor those with unpleasant side effects, patientsand families are encouraged to be patient andsupportive and to cooperate with qualifiedmedical personnel ( W atchtowe r, 15 October 1988, 28-29).Electroshock and stimulation Jehovah's Witnesses do not endorseelectroshock, but there is some evidence thatthey would leave decisions about electro-convulsive therapies to individuals ( Awake! 8 September 1986, 8). DEATH AND DYINGMEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND RESEARCH For Jehovah's Witnesses, death means only thetermination of conscious existence. Hell is not eternal torment. Thus, those people who diebefore Armageddon will experience death assleep, lasting until Jehovah's call to arise fromthe tomb. A final testing will follow theMillennium, at which time the righteous will begiven eternal life. Although death is consideredan enemy, it is not something to be feared by theloyal Witness whose hope lies in the resurrection(Watch Tower Society 1995: 82). CLINICAL ISSUES Determining death No position on determining when death occurswas found. Pain control and palliative care No statement on pain control and palliative carewas found.Forgoing life-sustaining treatment Where death is clearly imminent or unavoidable,the Bible does not require the artificial length-ening of the dying process. Allowing death totake its course under such circumstances doesnot violate any law of God ( Awake! 8 September 1986, 20-21). Suicide, assisted suicide, and active euthanasia Jehovah's Witnesses reject suicide. Life is a gift from God, not something to be abused or to endby one's own hand ( Awake! 8 September 1990). 5 In addition, the Christian has dedicated his life to God. Therefore it is not his own to dispose ofas he wishes. The Witnesses reject active euthanasia for several reasons. First, it violates thecommandment prohibiting murder (Exodus20:13). Second, it violates the biblical commandthat Christians \"hold a good conscience\" (1 Peter 3:16). This phrase is interpreted to referto the medical profession's general revulsion forNo information was found on the subject ofmedical experimentation. The injunction against blood transfusion for Witnesses wouldhold with any medical research or experiment.As a result of their interest in the transfusion issue, Witnesses appear to support medicalresearch on alternative blood therapies.taking active measures to hasten a patient's death. Finally, Christians are required to \"be insubjection to superior authorities\" (Romans13:1) and to obey the laws of the land.Therefore, in Jehovah's Witness thinking, active euthanasia is murder. Because [Witnesses] respect God's view ofthe sanctity of life, out of regard for their ownconsciences and in obedience to governmental laws,those desiring to conform their lives to Bibleprinciples would never resort to positive euthanasia. 6 Jehovah's Witnesses do not, however, oppose passive euthanasia: Where there is clear evidence that death is imminent and unavoidable, the Scriptures do notrequire that extraordinary (and perhaps costly)means be employed to stretch out the dyingprocess. In such a case, allowing death to take itscourse uninhibited would not violate any law ofGod. However, there is need for caution beforepeople decide that a patient is beyond all hope ofrecovery. (Larue 1985: 117) Although no reference to assisted suicide was found, assisting in suicide would be consideredmurder.Autopsy and postmortem care The Bible does not directly comment on autopsy,and Witnesses are encouraged to make decisionsin light of relevant biblical texts and the partic-ulars of the given situation. For example, giventhe tradition's respect for the dead body and itsviews on blood transfusion, some Witnesses feelthat unless there is a compelling reason, thebody of a relative should not be subjected to apostmortem dissection, especially one in whichblood is taken from the cadaver and used fortransfusion or some other purpose, of which theywould want no part. When the law mandates anautopsy, however, Christians should bear in mindthe counsel \"to be in subjection to the superiorauthorities\" ( W atchtower , 1 April 1987). Last rites, burial, and mourning customs There is no biblical command for or against either burial or cremation. Nor does burialinstead of cremation help distinguish \"true\"Christians from pagans. The dead should bedealt with in a dignified, respectful way, butwhether a family, for emotional, economic, orother reasons, has someone cremated is apersonal matter ( Awake! 8 August 1976). 10 THEJEHOVAH 'SWITNESS TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISION SSPECIAL CONCERNS ATTITUDES TOWARD BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS AND BLOOD THERAPY Although contemporary Witnesses readily seek medical assistance from non-Witness medical establishments, their rejection of bloodtransfusions frequently brings them into conflictwith physicians and the state (Cumberland1986: 470, 472). The Witnesses' objection to using or receiving blood has evolved over several decades.Accepting transfusion was finally banned in1945 after concern over the widespread use ofblood during World War II. The prohibition isbased on three biblical passages: Genesis 9:3, 4; Leviticus 17:10; and Acts 15:28-29. 7Witnesses do not view these passages as relating merely todietary or ritual laws. By treating blood asspecial, people in the Old Testament showedtheir dependence on God for life itself. Theyrefrained from ingesting blood because bloodhad special meaning for God, not becauseingesting it was unhealthful. The biblical lawapplies to blood transfusions just as it did tooral ingestion of blood. Violation of the prohi-bition portends dire consequences to Witnesses:receiving blood products is a sin and results inseverance of the relationship with God,forfeiture of the chance for eternal life, and separation from their congregation. Because ofthese concerns, the scriptural prohibition onblood is not to be ignored even in emergencysituations. Jehovah's Witnesses will refuse transfusion of whole blood, packed red cells, white blood cells,plasma, and platelets (Dixon and Smalley 1981:2471). Many will allow the use of heart-lung,dialysis, or similar equipment as well as intra-operative blood salvage where the extra-corporeal circulation is uninterrupted. Witnesses'religious understanding does not absolutelyprohibit the use of components such as albumin,immune globulins, and hemophiliac prepara-tions; each Witness must decide individuallywhether he or she can accept these ( W atchtower , 1 March 1989, 31). Witnesses do accept non-blood replacement fluids and volume expanders,including 2471). Unfortunately, since Watch Tower Society policy has tended to change in recent years, andhas become both more liberal and more incon-sistent with respect to the use of blood products,it is difficult for either Jehovah's Witnesses orphysicians to know exactly which blood productsWitnesses are allowed to take and which theyare not. For example, in a \"Question fromReaders\" article ( W atchtower , 15 June 2000, 29), the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnessesreaffirmed its stand against the taking of what itconsiders \"primary blood components\": redcells, white cells, platelets, and plasma (serum).Curiously, however, later in the same article (p.30), it was stated: Just as blood plasma can be a source of various fractions, other primary components (red cells,white cells, platelets) can be processed to isolatesmaller parts. For example, white cells may be asource of interferons and interleukins, used totreat some viral infections and cancers. Plateletscan be processed to extract a wound-healingfactor. And other medicines are coming along thatinvolve (at least initially) extracts from blood components. Such therapies are not transfusionsof these primary components; they usually involveparts or fractions thereof. Should Christians acceptthese fractions in medical treatment? We cannotsay. The Bible does not give details, so a Christianmust make his own conscientious decision beforeGod. In addition to the changes described above, the Watch Tower Society has stopped disfellow-shipping Jehovah's Witnesses who take bloodtransfusions voluntarily. However, this is achange without meaning because the Societynow simply regards such persons as \"disasso-ciated\" (Muramoto 2001: 37-9) from the Witnesscommunity and therefore to be shunned. Medical personnel need not be concerned about liability when Witnesses refuse transfu-sions, for Witnesses take adequate legal steps torelieve them of liability in such circumstances.For example, most Witnesses carry a MedicAlertcard, prepared in consultation with medical andlegal authorities, which is personally filled outand witnessed annually (Dixon and Smalley1981: 2472). Usually, though not always,Witnesses have made arrangements for proxy orsurrogate decision makers. Practitioners shouldbe careful to consult with the individual Witnessto learn what his or her conscience dictates. Witnesses who are married to non-Witnesses are urged to discuss their beliefs about bloodtransfusion in advance of any possible conflictsituation (Vinicky et al. 1990: 69). Care of minors presents the greatest concern to caregivers and often results in legal actionagainst parents under child-neglect statutes.Such actions are questioned by Jehovah'sWitnesses, who do seek good medical care fortheir children while claiming that considerationshould be given to their family's religious tenets.\"In the case of minor children, parents have theGod-given duty and legal right to decide fortheir offspring\" ( Awake! 8 September 1986, 21; Kingdom Ministry , September 1992, 4). When parents are confronted with the risk-benefit 11 THEPARKRIDGE CENTER12 THEJEHOVAH 'SWITNESS TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISION Spotential of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, Witnesses argue that therapies can be used thatare not religiously prohibited (Dixon andSmalley 1981: 2472). Although Witnesses agreewith laws or court actions to prevent child abuseor neglect, the Governing Body cites the viewthat the law's concept of family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks inmaturity, experience, and capacity for judgmentrequired for making life's difficult decisions. . . .Simply because the decision of a parent [on amedical matter] involves risks does not automati-cally transfer the power to make that decision tosome agency or officer of the state. 8 Often, large medical centers around the country that have experience with Witnesses will accept patient transfers from institutionsunwilling to treat Witnesses, even in pediatriccases (Dixon and Smalley 1981: 2472). Additionally, a number of local hospital liaison committees have been established toassist physicians in caring for the needs ofJehovah's Witnesses. Also, a network ofconsultants has been organized to assist physicians seeking alternatives to traditionalblood transfusion therapy. Further informationon alternative non-blood management or thetelephone number of the nearest hospital liaison committee is available from the worldheadquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,Department of Hospital Information Services([718] 560-5000).ATTITUDES TOWARD THE USE OF TOBACCO , ALCOHOL , AND DRUGS After years of discouraging but tolerating the use of tobacco, in 1973 the Governing Bodyinstructed Witnesses to stop smoking within sixmonths or face being disfellowshipped. Tobacco,it was argued, defiled and spirit,\"causing disease and damaging morals(W atchtower , 1 June 1973). Medically, smoking is a calamity for public health; but religiously,the taking of nicotine into the lungs and thebloodstream ignores God's standards for a pureand healthy body ( Awake! 8 November 1989). It is also considered \"druggery,\" which theWatch Tower Society regards as connected withdemonism ( W atchtower , 15 March 1973, 181; 1 June 1973, 339; 1 October 1988, 29). The consumption of alcohol escaped such condemnation. The Society spoke out againstdrunkenness, but church literature presentsalcohol as a gift from God to be used in moder-ation ( Awake! 8 May 1987). Witnesses who abuse alcohol are encouraged to seek counselfrom the elders; if they persist in their abuse,they may be disfellowshipped (Cumberland1986: 481; W atchtower , 1 May 1983). The use of such drugs as marijuana, cocaine, crack (a form of cocaine), heroin, ampheta-mines, and barbiturates is considered extremelyharmful to the body and is condemned for itscontribution to such social ills as crime,violence, and accidental or premature death.According to biblical principles, Witnessesclearly regard drug abuse as unacceptablebehavior ( Awake! 8 November 1990). The Watch Tower Society teaches that with strongmotivation, reliance on God, and social support,drug habits can be broken ( Awake! 8 December 1988, 12). Therefore, persons attempting toovercome drug addiction are sternly instructednot to use methadone ( W atchtower , 1 June 1973, 336).DIETARY CONCERNS According to Charles Russell, the Bible allows complete freedom in matters of diet(Cumberland 1986: 479). According to modernWatch Tower thinking, Jehovah's Witnesses are to use food and drink in moderation(W atchtower , 15 September 1987, 18). RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES Jehovah's Witnesses do not celebrate birthdays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Lent, or Easter. Nor dothey celebrate national holidays. In fact, theyhave only one holy day, the Memorial of theLord's Supper or, as they call it, the Lord'sEvening Meal, which they celebrate on 14 Nisanof the Jewish calendar. Thereby, they pay specialattention to the significance of Jesus' death.PATRIOTIC EXERCISES Jehovah's Witnesses do not vote or engageactively in politics, and because of theircommitment to their community and preachingwork, they tend not to be involved in non-religious activities of any kind. They respectgovernment officials as \"superior authorities\"and generally have the reputation of being law-abiding citizens; however, they consider suchpatriotic exercises or acts as saluting the flag ofany country or standing for national anthems asidolatrous state worship and contrary toScripture (Watch Tower Society 1995: 123-4). 13 THEPARKRIDGE CENTER1.

Increasingly, health-care workers face the challenge of providingappropriate care and services to people of differentreligious backgrounds. Unfortunately, manyhealthcare workers are unfamiliar with the reli-gious beliefs and moral positions of traditionsother than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practicalinformation about the values and beliefs of differ-ent religious traditions. It should assist nurses,physicians, chaplains, social workers, and adminis-trators in their decision making and care giving. Itcan also serve as a reference for believers whodesire to learn more about their own traditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the his- tory of the tradition, including its perspectives onhealth and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Final-ly, each booklet offers information on specialconcerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated byauthorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral deci-sions about clinical issues to individualconscience. We would therefore caution the read-er against generalizing too readily. The guidelines in these booklets should not substitute for discussion of patients' own reli-gious views on clinical issues. Rather, theyshould be used to supplement information com- ing directly from patients and families, and usedas a primary source only when such firsthandinformation is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practi- tioners see that religious backgrounds and beliefsplay a part in the way patients deal with pain, ill-ness, and the decisions that arise in the course oftreatment. Greater understanding of religious tra-ditions on the part of care providers, we believe,will increase the quality of care received by thepatient.
