Inunaki Sense the power of nature and feel reborn through Shugendo The KIX Senshu Tourism Bureau Evolved during the seventh century, the Shugendo religion is a joining of beliefs and traditions stemming from local folk practices, Shinto, Taoism and Buddhist worship. Journey to Mt. Inunaki in Osaka Prefecture, a stunning natural spot and Japanese heritage site where you can take part in these ancient practices. Home to the 1,300-year-old Shippo-Ryuji Temple and the headquarters of the Inunaki School of Shugendo, here you will experience spiritual healing through the natural elements of earth, water, fire, wind and air, as well as through practices such cliff climbing and waterfall training. Be guided by a local sendatsu (lit 'the one who has gone before'), a spiritual mountain leader who will mentor you to reconsider your behaviours and life. Historically women were not allowed to participate in ascetic training at sacred mountains, but here they are welcome. How to get there About 1 hour from Kansai Airport by Nankai train and Nankai Wing Bus. Transfer at Izumisano station from train to bus. "}
