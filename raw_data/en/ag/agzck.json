The Health - Based MCL is based on a study of developmental effects in which pregnant mice were exposed to PFNA for 16 days. The Health -based MCL is further supported by data on effects in the offspring in the same study , and on increased liver weight and other effects in additional rodent studies from the same and other laboratories. Benchmark dose modeling was performed on PFNA levels in blood serum that caused increased maternal liver weight in the pregnant mice. Appropriate uncertainty factors were applied to protect sensitive human subpopulations, account for differences between human and experimental animals, protect for chronic exposure, and account for the incomplete toxicology database for PFNA. Based on available toxicokinetic data from animal and humans, a rati o of 200:1 was used to estimate the increase in PFNA in human blood serum from ongoing exposure to a given concentration of PFNA in drinking water. A chemical specific Relative Source Contribution factor of 50% was developed based on the most recent NHANES data for the 95th percentile PFNA serum levels in the U.S. general population. Using this infor mation, a Health -based MCL protective for chronic drinking water exposure of 13 ng/L (0.01 3 \u00b5g/L) was derived. INTRODUCTION Development of Health -based MCLs b y New Jersey Drinking Water Quality Institute The New Jersey Drinking Water Quality Institute (DWQI), established by the 1984 amendments to the New Jersey Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) at N.J.S.A. 58:12A - 20, is charged with developing standards (Maximum Contaminant Levels ; MCLs) for hazardous contaminants in drinking water and for recommending those standards to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP ). The Health Effects Subcommittee (formerly \"Lists and Levels Subcommittee\" ) of the DWQI is responsible for recommending health -based drinking water levels (Health -based MCLs) as part of the development of MCLs (NJDWQI, 1987; 1994; 2009). Health -based MCLs are based on the goals specified in the 1984 Amendments to the NJ SDWA. For carc inogens, it is generally assumed that any level of exposure results in some level of cancer risk, and a one in one million (10-6) risk level from lifetime exposure is specified in the statute. Health -based MCLs for carcinogens are thus set at levels that a re not expected to result in cancer in more than one in one million persons ingesting the contaminant for a lifetime. For non -carcinogenic effects, it is generally assumed that exposure below a threshold level will not result in adverse effects . As specifi ed in the statue, H ealth -based MCLs are set at levels which are not expected to result in in \"any adverse physiological effects from ingestion\" for a lifetime. Other factors such as analytical quantitation limits and availability of treatment removal te chnology are also considered in the final MCL recommendation. For carcinogens, the 1984 Amendments to the NJ SDWA require that MCLs are set as close to the one in one million lifetime risk goal as possible \"within the limits of medical, scientific and tech nological feasibility.\" For non - carcinogens, MCLs are set as close to the goal of no adverse effects as possible \"within the limits of practicability and feasibility.\" 2 On March 21, 2014, the Commissioner Bob Martin of the NJDEP requested that DWQI recomme nd an MCL for perfluorononanoic (PFNA, C9). To support the development of an MCL recommendation by the DWQI, the Health Effects Subcommittee has developed a Health -based Maximum Contaminant Level for PFNA. As specified in the Amendments to the NJ S DWA, this Health -based MCL is intended to be protective for chronic (lifetime) drinking water exposure. Document development process The Subcommittee conducted a literature search of the PubMed and Toxline databases for potentially relevant information . Additional references were identified through backward searching. In total , approximately 455 references were identified (Appendix 1). All of these references were screened by title, abstract and/or full text. Based on this screening, 169 references rele vant to human health effects, human biomonitoring, animal toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and in vitro studies were designated for \"further consideration\" while 292 other references not relevant to these areas were excluded. Some references that were exclude d as irrelevant to these topics were used to inform supporting sections of this assessment, such as the \"Background Information\" and \"Environmental Sources, Fate, and Occurrence\" sections. In May 201 4, the DWQI posted a request for public input regarding data or technical information about the toxicology, epidemiology, toxicokinetics, or other health effects topics related to PFNA that should be considered in developing an MCL. The Health Effects Subcommittee received and considered comments relevant to t hese topics that were submitted by the public NJDEP has recently developed a draft Interim Specific Ground Water criterion for PFNA. Like Health -based MCLs, NJ Interim Specific Ground Water Criteria are intended to be protective for chronic (life time) dri nking water exposure. The Health Effects Subcommittee reviewed the Draft Technical Support Document for the Interim Specific Ground Water Cri terion for PFNA (NJDEP, 2014). Some sections of the Health -based MCL Support Document were developed de novo by the Health Effects Subcommittee, while other sections are based on updates of relevant information from the Draft Technical Support Document. In 2014, NJDEP solicited public comments on the Draft Technical Support Document for the Interim Specific Ground Wat er Criterion for PFNA. The Health Effects Subcommittee reviewed these comments and NJDEP's draft responses. In April 201 5, the DWQI posted the Draft Health -based MCL Support Document for public comment. All comments relevant to the Support Document were reviewed by the Health Effects Subcommittee . Revisions, where appropriate , are incorporated into this updated version . BACKGROUND IN FORMATION Perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) are a class of anthropogenic chemicals with structures consisting of a totall y fluorinated carbon chain of varying length and a charged functional group, such as carboxylic or sulfonic acid (Lindstrom et al., 2011). The eight carbon compounds, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS ) have been the most intensively studied PFCs in the past. R ecent research has focused on a wider range of PFCs including PFNA, the nine carbon perfluorinated carboxyl ic acid, which is the subject of this document. Because PFOA and PFNA are closely related and share similar p roperties, some of the discussions to follow include comparison s with information on PFOA as a part of the basis for evaluation of PFNA. 3 Physical and Chemical Properties (ATSDR, 2009; ALS 65-68 oC Boiling Point: 218 oC at 740 mm Hg Vapor Pressure: No data Water Solubility 9.5 g/L at 25 oC Log octanol/water partition coefficient: Not applicable Taste Threshold (water): No data Odor Threshold (water): No data Odor Threshold (air): No data PFNA is a fully fluorinated carboxylic acid. Because carbon -fluorine bonds are among the strongest found in organic chemistry, PFNA and other PFCs are extremely stable and resistant to chemical reactions (Post et al., 2013). PFNA and other PFCs contain a long perfluorocarbon tail that is both hydrophobic and oleophobic (repels both water and oil) and a charged functional group that is hydrophilic. Because they form a separate layer when mixed with hydrocarbons and water, measur ement of the octanol:water partition coefficient is not practical (Prevedou ros et al., 2006). PFNA is manufactured as its ammonium salt, ammonium perfluorononanoate (APFN), which dissociates in water. At the pH range found in drinking water (6.5-8.5), PFNA is present almost totally in the non-volatile anionic form, the perfluorononanoate anion (Goss, 2008; Rayne and Forest, 2010). Production and Use The production, industrial uses, and environ mental fate of PFNA were reviewed by Prevedouros et al. (2006). Production of PFNA b egan in 1975; it was made primarily in Japan. It is produced as the linear isomer of its ammonium salt (ammonium perfluorononanoate, APFN). It was esti mated that 10% of the APFN that was produced was released to air and water at the production facility, resulting in global emissions of 70,000 to 200,000 kg PFNA between 1975 and 2004. PFNA is the primary component of Surflon S -111 (CAS # 72968 -3-88), a commercial mixture of linear perfl uorinated carboxylic acids. Prevedouros et al. (2006) report the Surflon S-111 by weight as 0.1%. The primary historic use of PFNA w as as a proce ssing aid in the emulsion process used to make 4 fluoropolyme rs, mainly polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), s imilar to the use of PFOA as a processing aid in the production of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). PFNA is used to make PVDF (Prevedouros et al., 2006). Preve douros et al. (2006) lists the 2002 p roduction capacities of major producers of PVDF by the emulsion process which uses PFNA/Surflon S -111. The two highest capacity facilit ies using the emulsion process in 2002 were located in Calvert City, KY (8.4 x 106 kg/yr) and Thorofare (West Deptford), NJ (7.7 x 106 kg/yr), with lower capacity sites in France and Japan. PVDF is resistant to high temperatures and is chemically non-reactive. Uses of PVDF include: in tanks, valves, pipes, and other components which come into contact with reactive chemicals; as insulation for wire and printed circuit boards; as a coating in pressure and thermal optic sensor s; as a binder for electrodes on lit hium ion batteries; in artificial membranes used for bio medical applications, for monofila ment fishing lines; and in architectu ral coatings (TOEFCO, 2014). PFNA is not an intended component of PVDF and is prese nt only at trace levels (100-200 ppm) in the PVDF fluoropoly mer used in commercial and industrial products that is produced with PFNA (Prevedouros et al., 2006). It is estimated that 60% of the PFNA used in PVDF manufacturing world wide was released to the environ ment, resulting in global emissions of 400,000 to 1,400,000 kg from 1975 -2004 (Prevedouros et al., 2006). Data provided to NJDEP about PFC use at the PVDF manufacturing facility located in Thorofare (West Deptford), NJ indicate that 86.6% of the 125,069 kg of the Surflon S -111 PFC mixture (primarily PFNA) used between 1991 -2010 was released to the environ ment (air and water) (Roux Associates Inc., 2013). The environ mental fate of PFNA is discussed below. The manufacture and use of PFOA, PFNA, and other long-chain perfluorinated carboxylates is currently being phased out by eight major manufacturers through a voluntary stewardship agree ment with USEPA, with the intent to reduce global facility emissions and product content of these chemicals by 95% by 2010, and with the ultimate goal of eli minating emissions and product content by 2015 (USEPA, 2010, 2012a). The manufacturer of PVDF at the facility located in Thorofare is a participa nt in the voluntary stewardship agree ment. However, other manufacturers of long -chain PFCs that are not participants in the voluntary stewardship agree ment continue to manufacture these compounds, in the U.S. and particularly overseas (USEPA, 2009; Lindstrom et al., 2011). It is not known if PFNA is produced by manufacturers that are not part of the voluntary stewards hip agree ment with USEPA. Data provided to NJDEP show that Surflon S -111, the PFC mixture consisting primarily of PFNA, was not used in 2011 -2012 at the PVDF manufacturing facility located in Thorofare, NJ (Roux Associates Inc., 2013). In 2010, only 171 kg were used, co mpared to 6,341 -8,467 kg/year in each of the previous 10 years . Evaluations by other government agencies No health -based guidance values or standards have been developed for PFNA by U.S. federal agencies including USEPA, U.S. sta tes, or other nations. The European Chemical Agency (ECHA) Risk Assessment Committee fi nalized its harmonized classification and labeling opinion (CLH) for PFNA in September 2014 (ECHA, 2014). The ECHA classifications are related to hazard identification and 5 qualitative weight of evidence for various endpoints and do not include dose -respon se, quantitative risk assessment, or criteria development. ECHA concluded that PFNA is a presumed human reproductive toxicant for damage to the unborn child; a suspected human reproductive toxicant for fertility effects; a suspected human carcinogen; cause s specific target organ toxicity to liver, thymus, and spleen after prolonged or repeated exposure; and causes harm to the breast -fed child through effects on or via lactation. These conclusions are based on data on PFNA itself, as well as supporting infor mation from PFOA, to which it is closely related. The background document for the ECHA classification of PFNA was prepared by the Swedish Environmental Agency (Swedish Environmental Agency, 2013). ENVIRONMENTAL SOURCES, FATE, AND OCCURRENCE Because of the extre me stability of their carbonfluorine bonds, PFCs are extremely persistent in the environ ment. PFCs are highly water -soluble in comparison with other well-studied persistent and bioacc umulative organic pollutants which have much lower water solubili ties, such as polychl orinated dioxins and PCBs (Post et al., 2013). Although the production and use of PFNA is being phased out by major U.S. manufacturers, environ mental conta mination and human exposure to PFNA are anticipated to conti nue for the foreseea ble future due to its persistence, formation from precursor compounds (discussed below), and the potential for continued production by other manufacturers in the U.S. and/or overseas (USEPA, 2009; Lindstrom et al., 2011). PFCs including PFNA are found in environ mental media, including wildlife, in worldwide locations including remote polar regions. In addition to release from industrial facilities where it is made or used, an additio nal possible source of PFNA in the environ ment is its formation under some conditions from precursor compounds such as fluorotelo mer alcoho ls (FTOH), used industrially and in consu mer products (Butt et al., 2010; Buck et al., 2011). The fluorotelo mer alcohol 8:2 FTOH [CF3(CF2)7CH2CH2OH] is converted to some extent to both PFNA and PFOA through non-biological chemical reactions in the atmosph ere (Ellis et al., 2004) and through metabolic rea ctions in soil bacteria, under some conditions, and in fish (Butt et al., 2014). Polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid diesters such as diPAPs 8 :2 (larger molecules found in grease proof food contact papers, wastewater treatment plant sludge, and paper fibers from paper mills; D'eon et al., 2009) release FTOH that can degrade to PFCs. Fluoroacrylate polymers, used in commercial products, may also degrade in soil to release FTOH (Russell et al., 2008; Washington et al., 2009). Since PFNA and other PFCs do not degrade appreciably, environ mental PFC levels could be increased by even a small rate of conversion of the precursors to the terminal PFC product. Two major pathways have been proposed for long-range transport of PFCs such as PFNA to remote locations world wide (Lau et al., 2007; Butt et al., 2010). The relative contribution of each of the se pathways is not known. The first pathway involves the atmospheric transport of volatile precursors, such as FTOH, followed by oxidation to PFCs (e.g. PFOA and PFNA) whi ch are then deposited onto the land or the water. The second pathway involves long-range aqueous transport of perfluorinated carboxylates such as PFOA and PFNA in their anionic forms to remote locations by currents on the ocean's surface. 6 Drinking Water As discussed above, large amounts of PFNA w ere discharged to air, soil, and surface water at facilities where it was used as a processing aid in the production of the fluoropoly mer PVDF (Prevedouros et al., 2006; Roux Associates Inc., 2013). Like other ground water conta minants, PFCs that are released to the enviro nment can reach drinking water wells via the well-established pathways of migration of a ground water plume that has been conta minated either directly from surface spills and/or by conta minated surface water mixing with ground water drawn in by pumping wells. Air e mission has also been established as a pathway for ground water contam ination by the related compound, PFOA. In an industrial facility where PFOA was used as a processing aid in fluoropoly mer production, ground water used for drinking water was conta minated up to 20 miles or more from the emission source (Shin et al., 2011) . A pathway for this contamination was deposition from air onto soil, followed by migration through the soil to ground water (Davis et al., 2007). PFNA emitted to air from PVDF production facilities may reach ground water through the same pathway. This pathway, discussed further below, is being investigated as a possible source of PFNA in drinking water wells in the vicinity of a New Jersey PVDF production facility that emitted PFNA to air and water for about 25 years (Integral, 2013). In addition to indust rial releases, sources of PFCs found in ground water or surface water include: discharge from wastewater treatment plants that treat domestic and/or industrial waste; street - and storm water runoff; release of aqueous firefighting foams; and land applicati on of biosolids or conta minated industrial waste (Post et al., 2013). Another source of PFCs in the environ ment is the biodegradation in soil, sludg e, and wastewater of precursor compounds such as fluorotelo mer alcohols (FTOH), as discussed above. PFCs, i ncluding PFNA, have been found in raw a nd finished public drinking water from both ground and surface water sources in the U.S. and worldwide (Post et al., 2013; USEPA, 201 5a). Available information indicates that PFCs, inc luding PFNA, are not removed from drinking water by conventional treatment processes, but may be removed by granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis, and possibly ion exchange treatment syste ms designed for this purpose (Rah man et al., 2013). PFNA has been found less frequently and at lower concentrations than PFOA and PFOS in drinking water studies from the U.S. and around the world. Co mparison of occurrence frequencies for PFNA among drinking water studies is complicated by the fact that the reporting levels in these studies vary wide ly. In a literature review of drinking water occurrence studies worldwide (Post et al., 2013), the highest repor ted concentration of PFNA outside of Gloucester County, NJ was 58 ng/L in Catalonia, Spain (Ericson et al., 2009). Post et al. (2013) reported on a study of the occurrence of PFCs in raw water from 31 NJ public water supplies (29 sa mpled by NJDEP in 2009, and two sa mpled by a water company in 2010 -2013 using the same laboratory and method). In this study, PFNA was found in three NJ ground water sources at concentrations (72-96 ng/L) higher than the highest raw or f inished drinking water level (58 ng/L) reported elsewhere in the studies located in the literature. At these three NJ sites, PFNA was the sole or predo minant PFC detected, whereas PFNA w as a minor component of a mixture of PFCs when it was reported in drinking water at locations elsewhere in the world. The highest PFNA con centration (96 ng/L) reported in the 2009 NJDEP drinking water study was at a public water supply well (Paulsboro Water Depart ment) in southern NJ about 2 miles from the 7 West Deptford, NJ facility that used and dischar ged PFNA from 1985 until 2010 (Post et al., 2013). In follow -up sampling of this well in 2013, PFNA was found at 140 ng/L in raw water and 150 ng/L in finished water (Post et al., 2013). This well is currently not in use, and installation of treatment to remove PFCs from this well is planned. PFNA levels in another recently constructed well of this public water supply were lower (< 20 ng/L) in September 2013 testing. PFNA data are not available from two other wells of this water system which were used only on a limited basis until May 2012 and are not currently in use. PFNA was also detected at up to 72 ng/L in wells of a second public water supply (NJ A merican Logan -Birch Creek) located about 10 miles from the industrial facility (Post et al., 2013). The presence of PFNA (80 ng/L) reported at a third site by Post et al. (2013), located in northern NJ, was not confir med in follow -up sampling in 2013. In further public water supply sampling reported to NJDEP through March 2014, P FNA was also found in a public water supply well in West Deptford, within the same township as the industrial facility , at up to 48 ng/L in 2013, and in wells of 5 other Gloucester County public water supplies at up to 50 ng/L. Under the USEPA Unr egulated Conta minant Monitoring Rule 3 (UCMR3; USEPA, 2012b), nationwide monitoring of finished water for 30 unregulated conta minants, including PFNA and 5 other PFCs, is being conducted in 20132015 by all U.S. public water supplies serving more than 10,000 people and 800 representative PWS serving less than 10,000 people. Comparison of the UCMR3 PFC oc currence data with other PFC occurrence studies is complicated by the fact that the Reporting Level for UCMR3 monitoring of PFNA ( 20 ng/L) is much higher than the R eporting Levels in the NJDEP studies and other monitoring data reported to NJDEP and in the drinking water occurrence studies reported in the literature (generally < 5 ng/L, revie wed by Post et al., 2013). In initial UCMR3 data from 3483 public water supplies outside of New Jersey reported to USEPA through January 2015 , PFNA (20 ng/L or above) was found in only six public water systems outside of New Jersey (USEPA, 201 5a; Table 1 ). As of January 22, 2015, PFNA was found in UCMR3 monitoring in three public water supplies sites in Gloucester County, NJ (Woodbury City Water Depart ment, up to 56 ng/L; Monroe Township MUA, up to 28 ng/L; West Deptford Township Water Department, 30 ng/L ) including one public water supply (Monroe Township MUA) which had not previously reported detections of PFNA to NJDEP . In all but two of the non - NJ public water supplies reporting PFNA in UCMR3, other PFCs were also present, while PFNA was the only PFC r eported at the three Gloucester County, NJ, sites. Table 1. New Jersey versus national PFNA detections (20 ng/L) in public water supplies in initial UCMR3 results New Jersey (as of 1/22/15) National ( other than NJ) (as of January 2015) Number of PWS % of private well testin g results reported to NJDEP as of July 18, 2014, PFNA (at > 2.5 ng/L) was detected in wells at 26 of 94 (28%) of residences tested in the vicinity of the West Deptford industrial facility. Fifteen of the wells had PFNA levels above 20 ng/L, and the highest concentration found was 1,500 ng/L. Point of entry treatment systems (POETS) have been installed on those wells with PFNA levels of 20 ng/L that are currently used for potable purposes. 8 Ambient Surface Water In 200709, PFNA was found in the Delaware River water at up to 976 ng/L starting near and downstream of the discharge location of the above -mentioned indust rial facility; this is higher than the surface water concentratio ns elsewhere in the U.S. and worldwide in studies located in the literature. Elevated levels of PFUnDA (C11), a co mponent of the Surflon S -111 mixture used at the facility, were also found in the Delaware River at these sa me locations (DRBC, 2012). Wildlife PFCs with eight or more fluorinated carbons (PFNA and longer chain carboxylates, PFOS and longer sulfonates) are bioaccumulative in fish, while shorter chain-length PFCs are not (Conder et al., 2008). PFNA and other PFCs are found in biota, including marine mammals and other species, worldwide including in remote Arctic and Antarctic regions. The presence of PFCs in these species is believed to result from exposure both to these compounds and to precursors that are metabolized to PFCs (Houde et al., 2011). In a study of PFC levels in blood taken in 2003 from bottlenose dolphins in Bermuda, the East and West coasts of Florida, Charleston, SC, and Delaware Bay, NJ, the mean PFNA level in Delaware Bay dolphins (326 ng/g) was much higher than at the other sites (13-63 ng/g) (Houde et al., 2005). These higher levels in Delaware Bay may have resulted from discharges of PFNA from local industrial sources. In 2004 -07, PFNA and PFUnDA levels were elevate d in fillets from white perch and channel catfish from the same Delaware River locations where elevated levels were found in surface water in 2007200 9 (DRBC, 2009). In more recent data from 2010 and 2012 at these Delaware River locations, PFNA was not detected ( > 0.25 ng/ g, 2010; > 0.5 ng/ g, 2012) (DRBC, personal communication). Liver and serum were not analyzed in these studies. HUMAN BIOMONITO RING Human Serum PFNA is detected in the serum of greater than 99% of a represe ntative sample of the U.S. popu lation in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANE S) conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Kato et al., 2011 ; CDC, 2015); PFCs are also ubiquitous in the serum of populations worldwide (reviewed in Lau, 2012; Post et al., 2012). These four PFCs are biologically persi stent, with human half-lives of several years, as discussed in detail in the Toxicokinetics section below. In the U.S population as a whole, serum levels of PFNA are generally lower than for the other three ubiquitous PFCs. In the most recent NHANES data from 2011 -12 (CDC, 2015), geometric mean Based on the infrequent occurrence of PFNA report ed in U.S. public drinking water supplies in UCMR3 and other studies (discu ssed above), it is unlikely that the mean and median PFNA serum levels found in the U.S. general population in NHANES are influenced by drinking water exposures. To further verify this conclusion, local health officers from several counties reporting PFNA in UCMR3 through July 2014 were contacted by the Health Effects Subcommittee. Several of these counties reported that they had no information indicating that 9 their location participated in NHANES in 2011 -12, while one county was not contacted because it did not have a health department . Table 2.

Median PFNA serum levels in the epide miology studies of the general population from around the world that are reviewed in the Human Studies section below ranged from 0.3 ng/ ml to 2.36 ng/ ml. As discussed below, the lower median values are from studies of European populations, and the two highest median values (2.3 and 2.36 ng/ ml) are from Taiwanese studies. A number of other studies of general population human serum levels of PFNA from locations worldwide, which did not assess associations with health endpoints, are not reviewed herein. In data from 2001 -02 NHAN ES (Kato et al., 2009), PFN A and other PFCs in pooled serum samples from male and female children, age 3-5 and 6-11 years , of non -Hispanic white, non- Hispanic black, and Mexican -American ethnicity were gener ally similar in both age categories and both genders, with some differences among racial and ethnic groups. Human Breast Milk PFNA and other PFCs have been found in human breast milk in the general population of the U.S. and other nations. Fujii et al. (2012) sa mpled breast milk from 90 wo men (30 each from Japan, Korea, and China ) and compiled these results, as well as data from other studies conducted worldwide that had been reported in the literature. Detection frequencies and concentrati on ranges for PFNA in these studies varied widely, with some studies finding no sa mples with PFNA above a detection limit of 8.8 ng/L while other studies reported maximum levels of >100 ng/L. In the only study conducted in the U.S. (Tao et al., 2008 a), PFNA was found at >5.2 ng/L in 13 of 45 (29%) of breast milk samples collected in Massachusett s in 2004, with a mean of 7.26 ng/L, a median of 6.97 ng/L, and a maximum of 18.4 ng/L. Human Seminal Fluid PFNA and other PFCs were found in human seminal fluid in a study of Sri Lankans . The mean and median concentrations were 0.007 and 0.005 ng/ml, res pectively, and concentrations were significantly correlated with serum PFNA concentrations (Guruge et al., 2005). 10 SOURCES OF HUMAN EXPOSURE Sources of hu man exposure to PFCs include drinking water, food, food packaging, carpets, upholstery, and clothing treated for water and stain resistance, house dust, protective sprays and waxes, and indoor and outdoor air. Since PFNA bioaccu mulates in fish, consumption of conta minated fish in locations where PFNA has been discharged into surface waters is a potential exposure route. The primary use of PFNA is as a processing aid in the production of PVDF, a material which is not used as widely in consu mer products as the materials made with some other PFCs. Humans may also be exposed to PFCs including PFNA that are formed from fluoro telomer alcohols in environ mental media (discussed above) and by metabolism of fluoro telomer alcohols in the human body (Henderson and Smith, 2007; Nilsson et al., 2010; reviewed by Butt et al., 2014). Fluorot elomer alcohols and their precursors, such as polyfluoroalkylphosphoric acid diesters (diPAPs), have been used in consu mer products such as g reaseproof food pa ckaging paper. In contrast to other persistent and bioaccumulative organic compounds that are not water -soluble, ingestion of co ntaminated drinking water can be an important source of human exposure to PFCs. Elevated serum levels of PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS have been found in communities with conta minated private wells and/or public water supplies. However, no studies of serum levels in communities exposed to PFNA in drinking water have been conducted. Because of their long half - lives in the body, ongoing exposure to even relatively low d rinking water concentrations of biologically persistent PFCs sub stantially increases total human exposure. For example, ongoing drinking water exposure to PFOA increases PFOA serum levels with a serum:drinking water ratio of 100:1 or greater (Emmet t et al., 2006; Post et al., 2012; discussed in detail below). Consistent with their higher daily water consumption rate (ml/kg/day), serum levels are generally higher in young children than in adults exposed to the same PFC concentration in drinking water (Emmett et al., 2006; Mondal et al., 2012). Because PFNA exists in drinking water in its non-volatile anionic form, inhalation exposure is not expected from non-ingestion uses of d rinking water such as showering, bathing, laundry, and dishwashing . In contrast, t hese are important exposure routes for volatile drinking water conta minants. Similarly, dermal abso rption of PFNA during showering and bathing is insignificant compared to exposure through ingestion (NJDOH, 2014). The evaluation was based on skin permeability data for PFOA (Franko et al., 201 2), a compound which is expected to have a slightly higher pot ential for dermal absorption than PFNA. Com mercially available infant formula products does not appear to be a major source of exposure to PFNA or other PFCs in the U.S. Tao et al. (2008 b) evaluated PFCs in 21 sa mples of 5 brands of infant formula repre senting >99% of the U.S. market. Products tested included milk-, organic -, and soy-based formula, packed in cans, glass, or plastic, in liquid, powdered, and concentrated liquid forms. PFNA was not detected (<2.2 ng/L) in any sample. Other PFCs (for which detection levels varied) were also not detected (PFOA, PFBS, PFHpA) or were infrequently found ng/L; PFHxS -two detections at up to 3.59 ng/L). In this study, PFCs were also analyzed in 12 sa mples of 11 brands of dairy milk pur chased in Albany, NY in 2008, with only one detection of PFHxS at 3.83 ng/L. 11 TOXICOKINETICS Absorption PFCs, including PFOA which differs from PFNA by only one fluorinated carbon, are generally well absorbed orally (Lau, 2012; Post et al., 2012). While oral absorption of PFNA h as not been quantitatively evaluated, oral absorption occurs rapidly as indicated by its presence in serum in rodents soon after oral administration (Tatu m-Gibbs et al., 2011). Ammonium perfluorononanoate, the ammonium salt of PFNA , was absorbed by inhalation when generated as a dust, as demonstrated by its acute toxicity in rats exposed by this route (Kinney et al., 1989). No info rmation on the extent of der mal absorption of PFNA was located. PFOA penetrated rat and human skin in an in vitro system (Fasano et al., 2005), and caused liver toxicity in rats (Kennedy, 1985) and immune effects in mice (Fairley et al., 2007), aft er dermal exposure. estimated as 8.8 x 10-5 cm/hr (Fasano et al., 2005). The permeability coefficient of PFNA is expected to be close to, but slightly less than that of PFOA (F. Frasch, personal communication). Distribution and Metabolism Like other PFCs, PFNA is chemically non-reactive and is not metabolized (Lau et al., 2012). PFNA is primarily distributed to serum, kidney, and liver. After repeated administration to mice and rats, liver concentrations are higher than serum concentrations, while concentrations in the kidney are lower than in the serum (Tatu m-Gibbs et al., 2011). PFCs in general have an affinity for binding to proteins. Available infor mation indicates that PFNA, like other PFCs, is almost totally bound to albumin and other proteins in the serum (Lau, 2012 ). PFNA was found to bind (>98%) to plasma proteins in vitro (Ohmori et al., 2003). Excretion PFCs, including PFNA, are excreted in urine and feces, with the rate of excretion generally decreasing with increasing carbon chain length (Lau, 2012). Rode nts The toxicokinetics of PFNA and PFOA have been studied in mice and rats, and half-lives in these species are shown in Table 1. PFNA is excreted several -fold more slowly than PFOA in both genders of both of these rodent species . Both PFOA and PFNA are slowly excreted in both male and female mice and in male rats, with much more rapid excretion for both PFCs in female rats. In these species and genders, estimates of PFNA half -lives were 2 to 30 -fold longer than for PFOA. Rates of fecal elimination are slow, and are similar in male and female rats (Kudo et al., 2001). The differe nces in excretion rates between genders are belie ved to result from gender differences in renal organic anion transporters (OATs) that control urinary excretion rates. These proteins are responsible for the active transport (secretion or reabsorption) of many organic anions into and out of the kidney and other organs (Han et al., 2012; Weaver et al., 2010). In rats administered 20 mg/kg/day by intraperitoneal injection for 5 days, castration reduced the levels of PFNA in the liver, while PFNA levels in the livers were not decreased in castrated rats that were treated with testosterone (Kudo et al., 2000). These results 12 suggest that the rapid excretion of PFNA in male rats is depen dent on testosterone. In pharmacokinetic studies of linear ( n-) and branched ( iso-) PFNA after a single -dose (male rats only; Benskin et al., 2009) and with subchronic dosing (males and females dosed for 12 weeks; De Silva et al., 2009), the linear form w as excreted somewhat more slowly than the branched form. Half -lives were similar to those in the studies shown in Table 3. The half -lives in male rats were 41 -48 days for linear PFNA and 21 -32 days for branched PFNA, while the half -lives in females were 2. 1 days for linear and 0.82 days for branched PFNA. In the male rats in these studies, the half -lives of PFNA were 3 -5 times longer than for PFOA, based on comparison of groups treated with the same isomer for the same time period. PFNA has been measure d in urine and feces in several of the rat pharmacokinetic studies (Kudo et al., 2001; Benskin et al., 2009; De Silva et al., 2009; Mertens et al., 2010). Because urinary excretion of PFNA is very slow in male rats (discussed above), fecal excretion become s proportionally more significant as compared to female rats in which urinary excretion is rapid. In male rats, a large percentage (65 -68%; Benskin et al., 2009) is excreted in the feces (Kudo et al., 2001; Benskin et al., 2009). Table 3.

(2005) Humans Data on the human half-life of PFNA are extre PFBA) estimated from data on de clines in serum levels after occupational or drinking water exposures ended (summarized in Lau et al., 2012 and Post et al., 2012). For PFNA, no such data are available. Zhang et al. (2013 a) esti mated the human half-lives of a series of PFCs, including PFOA and PFNA, based on re nal cleara nce estimates. In women less than 50 years old, modeled excretion through menstrual blood loss was also considered. The study included 86 adults (age 21-88 years) from the Chinese general population. The median serum PFN A concentration in the subjects was 0.37 ng/ ml, which was about two -fold lower than the median of 0.86 ng/ml in the 2011-12 NHANES ( CDC, 2015 ). Renal clearance estimates for each PFC in each participant were based on paired urine and blood or serum measure ments. The PFNA half -life estimates in males and older females for PFNA (n=50) ranging from 0.34 to 20 years, while for PFOA (n=66), the range was 0.059 to 14 years. In younger females, the range for PFNA (n=16) was 0.38 to 7.7 years and for PFOA (n=20) wa s 0.19 to 5.2 years. Available data indicate that blood loss (e.g. through menstruation, blood donation, or 13 venesection) is an excretion route for PFCs (Harada and Koizumi, Taylor et al., 2014; Lorber al., 2015; MDH, 2013). The estimates of PFNA half-life in women under 50 years of age are based on modeling of this pathway and are considered more uncertain than the estimates for men and older women. Although children were not included in this study, the increased excretion rate due to menstrual blood loss is not applicable to children. Similarly, the additional clearance through menstrual blood loss is not relevant to pregnant women. Other potential clearance pathways, such as fecal excretion, were not considered by Zhang et al. (2013 a), but were believ ed by the researchers to be less significant than eli mination through urine and menstrual blood. Median and geometric mean values represent estimates of the 50th percentile value and are less affected by outliers than mean values. As shown in Table 4, the ratios of esti mated half -lives for PFNA and PFOA in men and older women, based on medians and geometric means, are 2.06 and 2.67 years, respectively. For younger women for whom menstrual clearance was modeled, the estimated ratios are closer to 1. As noted above, the estimates for younger wo men are more uncertain than the estimates for men and older women. In sum mary, while the half-lives estimated by urinary cleara nce are less definitive than those based on serum level declines, these results supp ort the conclusion that PFNA is more persistent in hu mans than PFOA. A longer human half-life of PFNA as compared to PFOA is consistent with the toxicokinetic data from rodents. Table 4.

Fetal exposure - Maternal and cord blood serum levels Fetal exposures to PFNA are important because develop mental effects are among the most sensitive toxicological endpoints for PFNA in animals (see Toxicology section below). PFNA, like other PFCs, is transferred from the mother to the fetus in animal studies (Das et al., 201 5; Wolf et al., 2010). Like other PFCs, PFNA is found in human umbilical cord blood (reviewed below), placenta, and amniotic fluid (Stein et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013 b), ther eby demonstrating that maternal -fetal transfer also occurs in humans. 14 In human studies, PFNA levels in fetal cord blood serum generally correlate with maternal serum levels. In nine studies in which both maternal and cord blood PFNA levels were measured, the mean cord blood seru m:maternal serum (or plas ma) ratios ranged from about 0.3 to about 1, with a median value of about 0.5 (Monroy et al., 2008 ; From me et al., 2010; Beesoon et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2011a; Liu et al., 2011 a; Needham et al., 2011 ; Gutzkow et al., 2011 ; Ode et al, 2013; Zhang et al., 2013b ). Infant Exposure - Distribution to Human Breast Milk Infants drink much more fluid (breast milk or formula which may be prepared with drinking water) on a body weight basis than older children and adults, and the intake rate is highest in the youngest infants. For exa mple, the mean drinking water intakes in infants who consu me drinking water are 137 ml/kg/day from birth to 1 month of age, and 53 ml/kg/day from 6-12 months of age (USEPA, 2008). F or breast fed infants, mean breast milk intakes in these age groups are 150 ml/kg/day from birth to 1 month of age and 83 ml/kg/day from 6-12 months of age (USEPA, 2008). In contrast, the mean daily drinking water intake is 13 ml/kg/day for children 11 or more years of age and adults (USEPA, 2008) and 26 ml/kg/day for lactating wom en (USEPA , 2011). Thus, infants who con sume formula prepared with conta minated drinking water receive a higher dose of the conta minant than older children and adults. Breast -fed infants will also receive higher exposures t han older children and adults for contaminants that are transferred to breast milk at concentrations even several -fold below the concentration in the drinking water source. As discussed in Human Biomonitoring above, PFNA is found in human breast milk. The importance of breast milk as a route of exposure of PFNA and other PFCs is illustrated by the data of From me et al. (2010 ; Table 5). Maternal and cord blood serum PFNA concentrations were studied in 53 Ger man mothers at birth and in their breast -fed infants. Although mean and median infant (cord blood) serum levels were less than in maternal serum at birth, serum PFNA increased at 6 months to levels higher than in maternal serum, presu mably from exposure through breast milk. At age 19 months, a time point at which breast feeding had stopped or was decreased, serum levels had decrea sed to close to maternal levels, presu mably due to decreased exposure on a body weight basis, c ombined with dilution due to rapid growth. Si milar findings would be expected in infants who are fed with formula prepared with drinking water contaminated with PFNA rather than with breast milk, assuming that the PFC concentrations in the drinking water are the same as in the breast milk.

In communiti es with drinking water supplies conta minated by PFOA and other persistent PFCs (PFOS and PFHxS), mean and median serum PFC levels were elevated above means and medians in the general population (reviewed in Post et al., 2013). For persistent compounds in general, the relationship between daily intake (as expressed either as a dose ( ng/kg/day) or a concentration in drinking water (ng/L)) and body burden is propo rtional to the compound's half-life (USEPA, 2003). Since blood serum (along with liver and kidney) is a major site of distribution for PFCs, serum levels are an indicator of body burden for these compounds. Thus, the seru m:drinking water ratio for persistent PFCs is expected to be proportional to their half- lives, p rovided that a constant fraction of total intake is distributed to serum. PFOA The relationship between drinking water conce ntration and serum concentration has been extensively evaluated for PFOA. It is well established that ongoing human exposure to PFOA in drinking water increases serum levels, on average, by >100 times the drinking water concentration. As discussed below, this ratio is supported by data from several studies of popu lations whose public water supplies or private wells were conta minated with a wide range of PFOA concentrations (60 ng/L to 13,300 ng/L), as well as three toxicokinetic modeling efforts (Emmett et al., 2006; Ho ffman et al., 2011; Clewell, 2006, 2009 ; Post et al., 2009a, 2009b, 2012 ; Worley and Fisher, 2015 ). Although upper percentile exposure factors are typically used in risk assess ment, 100:1 represents a central tendency (or lower) estimate for the ratio in exposed populations. The ratio can be higher or lower among individuals due to differences in daily water consump tion rates and physiological parameters related to excretion rate. Emmett et al. (2006) reported a median ratio of 105:1 in residents of Little Hocking, Ohio age 6 years or older who were exposed to 3,550 ng/L (3.55 \u00b5g/L) in their drinking water, with a 25%- 75% interquartile range of 62:1 -162:1. For six individuals with private wells included in this study, the ratios ranged from 142:1 to 855:1 (Emmett et al., 2006). Post et al. (2009 a) evaluated five other Ohio and West Virginia communiti es with lower drinking water concentrations (> 60 ng/L) in the sa me vicinity and found ratios of 100:1 to 330:1 in the four c ommunities for which reliable estimates can be made based on a relatively narrow range of reported PFOA drinking water concentrations. A ratio of >100:1 is also supported by data from several other studies. In 108 users of conta minated private wells with mean and maximum PFOA levels of 200 ng/L and 13,300 ng/L in the same Ohio/ West Virginia region discussed above (Hoffman et al., 2011), the estimated ratio was 141:1 (95% CI: 135:1 -148:1) based on regression modeling, based on a one-compartment toxicokinetic model. The 100:1 ratio is also consistent with observations in 98 Minnesota residents tested 34 months after exposure to contaminated drinking water ended if the expected post- exposure decline in serum levels is considered (M DH, 2009). A lower serum:drinking water ratio of approximately 50:1 was observed in a German community whose drin king water source was c ontaminated with PFOA and other PFCs (H\u00f6lzer et al., 2008). Possible reasons for this difference are the use of bottled water by some partici pants who were aware of the conta mination for up to 6 months before their blood was sa mpled, 16 uncertainty about the duration and time course of the water conta mination, or differ ences in drinking water consu mption patterns between German and U.S. residents. Clew ell (2006, 2009) developed a factor, 0.127 (ng/kg/day)/(ng/ ml), that relates intake of PFOA (ng/kg/day) and human serum level (ng/ml). The factor was derived from a pharmacokinetic model and was validated with data from the exposed community in Little Hock ing, Ohio. Using average daily water intake recommended by USEPA ( 2011 ) of 16 ml/kg/day, application of this factor predicts a serum:drinking water ratio of 126:1. This observed serum:drinking water ratio of app roximately 100:1 is also in agree ment with a one-compartment model (Harada et al., 2005) which predicts that ingestion of 0.0017 g/kg/day would result in serum levels of 13 g/L (ng/ml) in males and 8 g/L (ng/ml) in females, or a mean of 10.5 g/L (ng/ml) . Assu ming a drinking water intake of 16 ml/kg/day (USEPA, 20 11), a dose of 0.001 6 g/kg/day would result from a water concentration of 0.1 06 g/L. The ratio between a serum concentration of 10.5 g/L and this water concentration of 0.1 06 g/L is 99:1, very close to the median ratio reported by E mmett et al. (2006) . Finally, a serum:drinking water of approximately 100:1 is predicted by a recently developed physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that relates PFOA drinking water concentration to serum level. This model considers urinar y clearance rates and partition coefficients in humans for fat, liver, and kidney reported in the literature, as well as the most current drinking water exposure parameters (Worley and Fisher, 2015). PFNA The toxicokinetic studies discussed above indicate that rodent half -lives for PFNA are 2 to 30 -fold longer than for PFOA (Table 3), and that the median and geometric mean half-life of PFNA in humans (except in women of childbearing age) for PFNA is at least twice that of PFOA ( Table 4). (PFC half -life estimates in women of childbearing age in this study include a modeling component and are more uncertain.) These animal and human data support an estimated half-life of PFNA at least twice that of PFOA. Additionally, as discussed above, a 100:1 ratio for PFOA likely underesti mates the median value for this parameter . Taken together, this information indicates that an estimated serum:drink ing water ratio of 200:1 for PFNA is not overly stringent . Based on an assu med daily drinking water intake of 16 ml/kg/day (USEPA, 2011 ), the corresponding increase in daily dose of PFNA (ng/kg/day) that results in a 1 ng/ml increase in PFNA in blood serum is 0.08 ng/kg/day/(ng/ ml). This value is derived as follows: 200 ng/ml PFNA i n blood serum __________________ (1 ng/ ml PFNA in drinking water) x (16 ml/kg/day drinking water ingested) = 12.5 ng/ml PFNA ml) ng/kg/day PF NA the estimated daily dose of PFOA esti mated to result in a 1 ng/ ml increase in serum level (0.127 ng/kg/day/(ng/ ml); Clewell (2006, 2009) is associated with a serum:drinking water ratio of 1 26:1. This estimated daily dose is 1.49 ti mes the daily PFNA dose (0.08 ng/kg/day) estimated to increase the serum level by 1 ng/ ml. Based on the above toxicokinetic considerati ons, ongoing exposure to drinking water with 150 ng/L 17 PFNA (the highest concentration reported in public drinking water in New Jersey or elsewhere) is estimated to increase PFNA serum levels, on average, by 30 ng/ml ( \u00b5g/L ; ppb) in serum. This represents about a 34-fold increase from the general populat ion geometric mean serum value of 0.88 ng/ml (CDC, 2015 ). HEALTH EFFECTS Human Studies Overview In total, 44 human epidemiology studies evaluating associations of PFNA with health endpoints were reviewed and are discussed below. An individual table summarizing the design , study populations, outcomes and exposures, results, and limitations of each of these studies is found in Appendix 2. All of these studies, with the exception of one study of occupationally exposed workers evaluated the general population, and none of them were conducted in communiti es known to have drinking water contamination with PFNA. The epidemiology studies evaluated associations of PFNA with serum lipids; metabolic parameters including diabetes; effects on the immune system, thyroid, and reproductive system; liver enzymes; birth outcomes; and several other endpoints. Associations of cancer with PFNA have been investigated in one study. The studies were conducted on populations in the U.S. as well as several Asian nations, several European nations, and Canada. Populations from different studies may not be comparable due to differences in age, pregnancy status, basis for enrollment, and PFNA exposure ranges (see below), as well as nationality. Summary tables for some health outcome categories are included below (Table 6A-G). The range of serum levels in the general population studies that evaluated these effects is lower than those which may result from exposure to drinking water contaminated from PFOA. Although exposure to workers was higher, the occupational study is limited in its ability to detect associations for reasons discussed above. Therefore, the available data are not sufficient to evaluate the potential for PFNA to impact these parameters at higher exposures such as may occur from ingestion of contaminated drinking water. PFCs other than PFNA, including PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS, are ubiquitously present in the serum of the general population at concentrations generally higher than PFNA (Lau et al., 2012). A general issue in interpretation of epidemiology studies of PFN A is co -exposure to other PFCs, which in some instances were highly correlated with PFNA. Although some of the studies controlled for co -exposure to other PFCs when evaluating associations with PFNA, many studies did not include this adjustment, limiting t heir ability to determine the independent impact of PFNA. General Population Studies A strength of the general population studies is their use of PFNA serum levels as the basis for exposure assessment. Because of the long human half -life of PFNA, serum levels at a single time do not rapidly fluctuate with short term variations in exposure and reflect long -term exposures ( see Toxicokinetics section above). Serum levels thus provide an accurate measure of internal exposure for each study participant, an advantage over studies based on external exposure metrics such as drinking water concentrations. 18 Of the general population studies, 28 were cross -sectional and one included a cross -sectional component. A general limitation of cross -sectional studies i s that they evaluate information on both exposure and outcome at the same point in time, limiting their ability to establish temporality. Occupational Studies Occupational studies are often considered useful for evaluating effects of environmental contaminants because exposure levels are generally higher than in the general population or in communities exposed through site -specific environmental contamination. However, the sole occupational study of PFNA has several important limitations (Mundt et al., 2007) . Importantly, Mundt et al. (2007) used work history rather than serum PFNA data for exposure classification. Potentially relevant to the evaluation of this study, PFOA serum levels in the least exposed groups of workers in some occupational studies of PFOA production workers were well above the general population range (reviewed in Post et al., 2012); this may also have been the case for PFNA exposures in the group classified as having no exposure by Mundt et al. (2007). Associations of PFOA, as well as PFOS, with some clinical parameters, including cholesterol and liver enzymes, exhibit a steep dose -response curve in the lower exposure range found in the general population with a plateau at higher exposures such as those found occupationally. For dos e-response curves of this type, even the least exposed workers may have exposure levels that fall on the plateau portion of the dose -response curve. Thus, workers at a facility who are assumed to be non -exposed may not necessarily represent an appropriate group for comparison with more highly exposed groups of workers within a facility (Post et al., 2012). Other limitations of this study are discussed as relevant to specific endpoints, below. Studies in Exposed Communit ies To our knowledge, there have been no stud ies of populations exposed to PFNA through conta minated drinking water or other environ mental media. It is relevant to note that extensive infor mation from communities with drinking water conta minated with the closely related co mpound PFOA is available from the C8 Health Project. This is a community health study of approxi mately 70,000 Ohio and West Virginia residents with at least one year of exposure to drinking water conta minated with PFOA at <50 ng/L to over (Frisbee et al., 2009; C8 Science Panel, 2014; reviewed in Post et al., 2012).This study is notable because of its large size, the wide range of exposure levels, and the large number of para meters evaluated. Associations of PFOA serum concentrations were reported for a number of health endpoints, some of which have not been evaluated for PFNA in humans, including two types of cancer (Barry et al., 2013; Vieira et al., 2013). For other health endpoints, no associations were found in the C8 Health Project population.

General populations studied included the general U.S. population (Lin et al., 2009; Nelson et al., 2010), a random selection of health clinic attendees in China (Fu et al., 2014), individuals with abnormal urinalys is results in Taiwan (Lin et al., 2013 a), and pregnant women in Norway (Starling et al., 2014). In these general population studies, median or geometric means for PFNA serum levels ranged from 0.37 ng/L to 1. 68 ng/L; PFNA serum level data was not provided in the occupational study (Mundt et al., 2007). Parameters evaluated in one or more of these studies were total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), non-HDL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and triglycerides. Study details are provided in the tables for individual studies (Appendix 2) and the summary table for serum lipids above (Table 6A). Three of four cross -sectional studies evaluating total cholesterol found evidence of a positive association with PFNA (Fu et al., 2014; N elson et al., 2010; Mundt et al., 2007) while the fourth study, in pregnant women, found no significant association (Starling et al., 2014). In the two cross -sectional studies that reported positive associations and provided PFNA serum data, there was an i ncreasing trend of serum PFNA with total cholesterol (Fu et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 2010). The occupational study additionally included a component employing a retrospective cohort design that evaluated men only but found no association with total choles terol (Mundt et al., 2007) . The results of six studies evaluating high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and PFNA were inconsistent; one study found a positive association among adolescents but not among adults (Lin et al., 2009), one found a positi ve association in pregnant women (Starling et al., 2014 a) and four others found no association (Nelson et al., 2010; and Mundt et al., 2007). HDL was the only lipid-related endpoint that was analyzed in both studies of the general U.S. population, and both studies consistently found no association of PFNA and HDL among adults (Lin et al., 2009; Nelson et al., 2010). The results of six studies evaluating triglycerides and PFNA all found no evidence of an association (Fu et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2013a; Mundt et al., 2007; and Starling et al., 2014 a). Four of five studies evaluating low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and PFNA did not find associations (Lin et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2010; Starling et al., 2014 a; and Mundt et al., 2007), while one study found a positive association (Fu et al., 2014). Selection bias may be an issue in Fu et al. (2014 ) since the study includ ed only individuals attending a health clinic check -up such that individuals concerned with e xisting health issues may be more likely to be included. This may also be true in Lin et al. (2013 a), which included individuals with an abnormal urinalysis from a population -based screening program in which the final study population was made up of 246 ( 37%) individuals with elevated blood pressure. Information bias is unlikely to have an impact in the general population studies which relied on serum concentrations and clinical biomarkers. In contrast, Mundt et al. (2007) relied on medical 30 record abstract ion of clinical parameters and work histories for exposure classification. Other limitations of Mundt et al. (2007) include small sample size that may limit power to detect associations, possibility of healthy worker effect, and the possibility that expos ure in the least exposed groups may be well above the population exposure range in occupationally exposed individuals. The epidemiologic data provide evidence of consistency, specificity, and exposure -response for PFNA and increased total cholesterol , although data on temporal relationship and strength of an association are limited. The possibility that PFNA causes increased cholesterol is further supported by evidence from epidemiology studies of PFOA, a closely related compound with similar toxicologica l effects. The epidemiology database for PFOA includes multiple studies of different designs in the general population, communities with drinking water exposure, and workers with occupational exposure, and suggests that a causal relationship may exist betw een PFOA and increased cholesterol (reviewed by Post et al., 2012; ECHA, 2014b). The available epidemiological evidence does not support an association with PFNA and other serum lipid outcomes including HDL, LDL, and triglycerides. Mode of action stud ies relevant to effects of PFNA on cholesterol and other lipid endpoints are discussed in the Mode of Action section (below). Metabolic Parameters Four cross -sectional studies (Lin et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2011; Lind et al., 201 4; and Nelson et al., 2010) evaluated the association of PFNA with one or more metabolic parameters : glucose, insulin, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA), clinically diagnosed diabetes, and BMI. The study populations evaluated in these studies may not be comparable since t hese four studies differed in the ages, nationalities, and enrollment basis for their study populations; the ranges of serum PFNA levels; and the endpoints evaluated. Serum PFNA levels were similar in two studies of the general U.S. popu lation (Lin et al., 2009; Nelson et al., 2010) and elderly individuals in the general Swedish population (Lind et al., 2013), and were relatively higher in a Taiwanese study participants with abnormal urinalysis results (Lin et al., 2013). Serum levels of maternal participants in a Danish prospective birth -cohort of mother -offspring pairs were several -fold lower than in the other studies (Halldorsson et al., 2012) . Study details are provided in the tables for individual studies ( Appendix 2) and summary tab le for metabolic endpoints (Table 6B). Statistically significant results in the four cross sectional studies included a negative association with insulin and PFNA among 12 - 20 year olds (but not among those greater than 20 years of age) in the U.S. genera l population (Lin et al., 2009), and a positive association with diabetes and PFNA among the elderly in Sweden when the outcome was treated as a quadratic term, but not when treated linearly (Lind et al., 201 4). The association of insulin with PFNA had a l inear coefficient of small magnitude (Lin et al., 2009), and the association with diabetes had a small effect estimate with a wide confidence range (OR=1.25, 95% CI 1.08 -1.44; Lind et al., 201 4). As summarized in Table 6B, no associations were found for in sulin in two other cross -sectional 31 studies, or for glucose in any of the three cross -sectional studies in which it was evaluated; diabetes was not assessed in any of the other studies. Three studies evaluated the relationship of PFNA and BMI. A cross -sectional study of the U.S. general population found no evidence of an association with this endpoint (Nelson et al., 2010) and a Danish prospective birth cohort study, based on maternal PFNA serum levels for subjects evaluated in young adulthood, found an i nconsistent positive association (Halldorsson et al., 2012) , and a study of young adults with abnormal urinalysis results found no association (Lin et al., 2013a). In Halldorsson et al. ( 2012 ), PFNA serum levels were several -fold lower than in the other studies of metabolic effects and fell within a narrow range, and PFNA was correlated with PFOA, which was found at much higher levels in serum. When PFOA was controlled for in an analysis of BMI and PFNA, the association became insignificant (Halldorsson e t al., 2012). Five studies evaluated the relationship of PFNA and HOMA and found no association; all were cross - sectional (Lin et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2013a; Lind et al., 201 4; and Nelson et al., 2010). Selection bias may be an issue i n Lin et al. (2011) which included individuals with an abnormal urinalysis from a population -based screening program. Also losses due to follow -up in Halldorsson et al. (2012), a prospective birth cohort , may present bias. Information bias in unlikely to h ave an impact in these studies which relied mostly on serum concentrations and clinical biomarkers. The small number of studies that evaluated concurrent exposure to PFNA and metabolic effects provide only limited evidence of associations of PFNA with the se endpoints. The sole study that evaluated prenatal exposure suggested a potential association with PFNA and metabolic effects, but limitations in this study impact the ability to determine the independent impact of PFNA. The results of this study are no t sufficient to develop conclusions about the potential for early life exposure to PFNA to cause these effects in adulthood. Parameters related to glucose metabolism were affected by PFNA in mice (Fang , 2012 a). These studies are discussed in the Animal Toxicology and Mode of Action sections below. Immune System Outcomes Information on the effects of PFNA on immune system outcomes in human observational studies comes from a case -control study (Dong et al., 2013), two prospective birth cohorts (Gran um et al., 2013 and Wan g et al., 2011) and a cross -sectional study (Humblet et al., 2014). Study details are provided in the tables of individual studies (Appendix 2) and summary table of immune system outcomes above (Table 6C). Epidemiologic information on the effects of PFNA on human immune system outcomes is limited. Three studies evaluated PFNA and asthma among adolescents; a case -control study in Taiwan which found a positive significant association (Dong et al., 2013) , a small (n=55 to 99) prospecti ve birth cohort which found no association (Granum et al., 2013), and a larger cross - sectional study of the general U.S. population which found no association (Humblet et al., 2014). Two studies assessed wheeze and found no association (Granum et al., 2013 and Humblet et al., 32 2014). The Taiwanese case -control study additionally assessed immunological markers and found a positive association , while a prospective birth cohort of children of pregnant women in Taiwan found no association with either immunologic al markers or atopic dermatitis ( Dong et al., 2013 and Wang et al., 2011 , respectively ). Granum et al. ( 2013 ) also found no association with atopic eczema . The results of these studies do not provide evidence of associations with PFNA and the outcomes eva luated. Although some studies found significant associations, findings from additional studies were inconsistent. A prospective birth cohort study in Norway found evidence of decreased response to rubella vaccine but not three other vaccines, inconsistent evidence of positive association with the common cold depending on which age period was evaluated, and no association with gastrointestinal illness (Granum et al., 2013). In this study, the association with decreased vaccine response was stronger for PFNA than for three other PFCs (PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS); serum levels of PFOS and PFOA were 4 to 14 fold higher than PFNA. Other studies that have found associations with other PFCs and decreased vaccine response in children (Grandjean et al., 2012) and adults (Looker et al., 2013) did not evaluate PFNA. Information from the single study that evaluated PFNA is not sufficient to conclude whether or there is an association of PFNA and vaccine response. Selection bias may influence estimates in Dong et al. ( 2013 ) case-control study. Losses due to follow -up may also influence findings in prospective birth cohorts (Granum et al., 2013; and Wang et al., 2011). Information bias may be present due to parental response to questionnaire - based outcome assessments. PFNA and other biologically persistent PFCs, including PFOA and PFOS, cause immunotoxicity in animal toxicology studies (Lau et al., 2012). The studies which evaluated PFNA are discussed in the Animal Toxicology and Mode of Action sections below. Thyroid hor mones and other related outcomes Studies of thyroid hormones and related outcomes including hypo - and hyperthyroidism and thyroid disease include seven general population cross -sectional studies (Bloom et al., 2010; Jain, 2013; Ji et al., 2012; Lin et al. , 2013 b; Lopez -Espinosa et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013; and Wen et al., 2013), two prospective birth cohort studies (Kim et al., 2011 b and Webster et al., 2014), one study which presents findings from a cross -sectional and prospective birth cohort study d esigns (Wang et al., 2014), and one occupational cross -sectional study (Mundt et al., 2007). These four studies differed in the age, nationality, and enrollment basis for their study populations; their ranges of serum PFNA levels; and the endpoints evaluat ed. Study details are provided in the tables of individual studies ( Appendix 2) and the summary table for thyroid effects and other related outcomes (Table 6D). All 11 studies evaluated associations with an increase of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Only one study found limited evidence of a positive association with TSH (Webster et al., 2014) while the 10 other studies found no evidence of an association. Of the eight studies that evaluated total thyroxine (TT4), six found no association (Jain, 2013; Ji et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2011 b; Mundt et al., 2007; and Webster et al., 2014), one found a negative association (Wang et 33 al., 2014 a), and one found a positive association (Lopez -Espinosa et al., 2012). Five studies found no association with free thyr oxine (FT4) (Bloom et al., 2010; Jain, 2013; Mundt et al., 2007; and Webster et al., 2014), one study found a positive association (Lin et al., 2013 b), and in a report which included two separate studies, no association was found among neonates in a prospe ctive cohort study and a negative association was found in pregnant women in a cross - sectional analysis (Wang et al., 2014). Hypothyroidism was evaluated in three of the 11 studies, and additional endpoints (free triiodothyronine, thyroglobulin, hyperthyro idism, and unspecified thyroid disease) were each evaluated in only one study; no associations were found for any of these endpoints. Selection bias may be an issue in Lin et al. (2013 b) which included individuals with an abnormal urinalysis from a popul ation -based screening program. Information bias is unlikely to have an impact in these studies which relied mostly on serum concentrations of exposure and outcomes. Although, serum thyroid measures are collected at a single time point in many studies, the measures are maintained over time. Also reliance on recall for studies assessing thyroid disease, hypo -, and hyperthyroidism may bias results (Lopez -Espinosa et al., 2012). Small sample sizes in some studies may have limited their power to detect associati ons (Bloom et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011 b; Mundt et al., 2007; Webster et al., 2014). In summary, the results of the available epidemiologic studies generally do not provide evidence of associations with PFNA and thyroid hormones. The limited evidence from epidemiological studies of PFNA and thyroid disease does not support associations with these endpoints. An in vitro study that evaluated the effects of PFNA on thyroid -related endpoints ( Long et al., 2014 ) is discussed in the Mode of Action section , below. Reproductive Outcomes Although a variety of reproductive outcomes have been evaluated in epidemiology studies of PFNA, data for each of these outcomes is very limited. Only one epidemiology study evaluated each of the following endpoints: age at m enarche (Christensen et al., 2011), menopausal status (Taylor et al., 201 4), hysterectomy (Taylor et al., 201 4), preeclampsia (Starling et al., 2014 b), endometriosis (Louis et al., 2012), sperm methylation (Leter et al., 2014), and sperm DNA damage (Specht et al., 2012). Semen quality parameters were the only outcome assessed in two studies ( Louis et al., 2015 ; Toft et al., 2012). Study details are provided in the tables summarizing individual studies (Appendix 2) and summary table for reproductive outcomes (Table 6E). There was a positive association for menopause and hysterectomy in a cross -sectional study of the U.S. population (Taylor et al., 201 4) and minimal and inconsistent evidence of an association with endometriosis in a case -control study in two U.S. cities (Louis et al., 2012). As discussed in the Excretion subsection of the Toxicokinetics section (above), blood loss is an excretion route for PFNA and other PFCs. Because higher PFCs were associated with both natural menopause and hysterectomy, th e authors conclude that the increased serum levels of PFNA with earlier menopause may be a result of reverse causality since menstruation is no longer an excretion pathway for PFNA. 34 Information bias is unlikely to have an impact in these studies which re lied mostly on serum concentrations of exposure and outcomes. As above, the range of serum levels in the general population studies assessing these reproductive endpoints is lower than exposure ranges which may result from exposure to drinking water cont aminated from PFNA, limiting ability to assess potential associations with reproductive outcomes occurring at higher exposures ranges of PFNA. In summary, the database for PFNA and each individual reproductive effect is very limited. Except for a minima l and inconsistent association with endometriosis in one study and an association with menopause likely due to reverse causality in another study, no associations with PFNA were found for the reproductive endpoints that were evaluated. Studies that eval uated reproductive effects of PFNA in animals are discussed in the Animal Toxicology section (below). Neurobehavioral Outcomes Studies providing epidemiologic evidence of associations of PFNA with neurobehavioral outcomes include a cross -sectional study a nd a matched case -control study of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Hoffman et al., 2010; Ode et al., 2014), a cross -sectional study of impaired response inhibition (Gump et al., 2011), two cross -sectional studies of memory impairment (Gall o et al., 201 3; Power et al., 2013), and a prospective birth cohort study of autistic behaviors (Braun et al., 2014). Study details are provided in the tables for individual studies (Appendix 2) and summary table for neurobehavioral outcomes above (Table 6F). Neither a matched case -control study in Sweden (Ode at el., 2014) nor a cross -sectional study in the U.S. general population (Hoffman et al., 2010) found evidence of an association with PFNA and ADHD. A cross -sectional study assessed impaired respons e inhibition and found a negative association with total PFC serum concentration and certain other PFCs but findings for the effect of PFNA alone were inconsistent (Gump et al., 2011) . There is no further evidence of an association with memory impairment i n two cross -sectional studies (Gallo et al., 201 3 and Power et al., 2013), or autistic behaviors in a prospective birth cohort (Braun et al., 2014). Information bias is possible in some studies due to self -reporting errors or parental report on outcome c lassification (Gallo et al., 2013; Hoffman et al., 2010; Power et al., 2013). Small sample sizes in some studies may limit the power of some studies to detect an association (Braun et al., 2014; Gump et al. 2011; Ode et al., 2014). The limited epidemiolog ic evidence provides minimal evidence of associations of PFNA and neurobehavioral outcomes. The potential for PFNA to cause neurobehavioral effects in animals has not been thoroughly evaluated, particularly as related to effects resulting from prenatal o r early life exposures (see Discussion of Uncertainties , below). 35 Birth Outcomes Evidence describing the associations of PFNA with birth outcomes is available from three prospective birth cohort studies. A nested prospective birth cohort (Monroy et al., 200 8) evaluated birth weight, and gestational length. A prospective birth cohort study (Chen et al., 2012) assessed gestational age, birth weight, birth length, head circumference, ponderal index, preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age and another prospective birth cohort study (Kim et al., 2011 b) evaluated birth weight. Serum PFNA concentrations varied over a 5-fold range among the study populations in the three studies, with geometric mean in cord blood of 2.36 ng/mL in Chen et al. (2 012), and medians in cord blood of 0.94 ng/mL in Monroy et al. (2008) and 0.45 ng/ml in Kim et al. (2011 b). Additional study details are provided in the tables summarizing individual studies (Appendix 2). The three studies which evaluated PFNA and birt h outcomes did not find associations with birth weight. It is relevant to note that these three studies also did not find associations of PFOA and decreased birth weight, inconsistent with the general body of data on this issue, suggesting that their abili ty to detect associations with PFCs may have been limited. Two recent syste matic reviews evaluated the numerous studies of associations of serum PFOA and fetal growth, as indic ated by birth weight and other para meters (Johnson et al., 2014; Bach et al. 201 5). Both reviews found that PFOA was associated with decreased average birth weight in most studies, and Johnson et al. (2014) concluded that the overall body of data from human studies is sufficient to conclude that decreased fetal growth is associated with PFOA exposure. The only study that evaluated birth length and decreased ponderal index found small but significant increases (Chen et al., 2012). Small sample sizes in these studies limited the ability to form conclusions on the impacts of PFNA and oth er PFCs. PFNA causes adverse effects on developmental endpoints, including neonatal mortality and postnatal growth and development, in animals. These studies and data relevant to potential modes of action for these effects are discussed in the Animal Toxi cology and Mode of Action sections, below. Liver Enzymes and Bilirubin Three cross -sectional epidemiologic studies evaluated the association of PFNA and liver enzymes and/or bilirubin. Lin et al. (2010) assessed the associations of PFNA in the general U.S . population with the liver enzymes, ALT and GGT, and total bilirubin and found a positive association only with total bilirubin. Gleason et al. (2015) assessed the same parameters as Lin et al. (201 0) as well as the enzymes, AST and ALP, also in the U.S. general population, and found a positive association with PFNA and ALT and limited evidence of an association with GGT. Mundt et al. (2007) evaluated AST, ALT, bilirubin, GGT, and ALP and found evidence of a positive association with ALT among occupational ly exposed study participants. Serum PFNA concentrations in the two studies of the U.S. general population differed (Lin et al., 2010: median=0.7 ng/ml while Mundt et al. (2007) did not provide information on serum concentrations. Additional study details are provided in the tables summarizing individual studies (Appendix 2) and summary table of findings (Table 6G) . 36 These results provide limited evidence of an association with ALT and PFNA. Associations of the clos ely related compound, PFOA, and ALT were also found in the U.S. general population, communities with drinking water exposure, and occupationally exposed workers (reviewed in Post et al., 2012). The limited epidemiological information that is available did not find associations for PFNA and AST, bilirubin (total), GGT, or ALP. Information bias is unlikely to have an impact in the general population studies which relied on serum concentrations and clinical biomarkers. In contrast, Mundt et al. (2007) relied on medical record abstraction of clinical parameters and work histories for exposure classification. Other limitations of Mundt et al. (2007) include small sample size that may limit power to detect associations, possibility of healthy worker effect, and t he possibility that exposure in the least exposed groups may be well above the population exposure range in occupationally exposed individuals. The hepatic toxicity of PFNA and other PFCs in animals is well established (Lau et al., 2012). Hepatic toxic ity of PFNA in animals and potential modes of action for these effects are discussed in the Animal Toxicity and Mode of Action sections, below. Other outcomes Cross -sectional studies evaluating associations of PFNA with several additional outcomes have been reported. Study details are provided in the tables for individual studies (Appendix 2). Uric acid Three studies evaluated PFNA and uric acid. There was evidence of a positive association of PFNA with a small increase in uric acid in a cross -sectional study of the U.S. general population (Gleason et al., 2015), but no such association was found in an occupational study (Mundt et al., 2007) or in a cross -sectional study of a Taiwanese study group with previously abnormal urinalysis results (Lin et a l., 2013 a). Elevated levels of uric acid are associated with a variety of health outcomes, and increased uric acid has been associated with PFOA (Gleason et al., 2015). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) Watkins et al. (2013) found an assoc iation of PFNA and estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR), a measure of kidney function, in a cross -sectional study of children from a community with elevated PFOA exposures from contaminated drinking water. This association likely results, at least in part, from reverse causality since PFNA is excreted by the kidney, so its elimination is slower when kidney function is impaired. Carotid artery intima -media thickness A cross -sectional study in a Taiwanese population with abnormal urinalysis results did not find an association with PFNA and carotid artery intima -media thickness (CIMT) a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis (Lin et al., 2013 a). Selection bias may be present in this study which included individuals with an abnormal urinalysis from a p opulation -based screening program in and which the final study population was made up of 246 (37%) individuals with elevated blood pressure. 37 LINE -1 DNA methylation LINE -1 DNA methylation A cross -sectional study of U.S. adults from a community with elev ated PFOA exposures from contaminated drinking water found no association of PFNA with % LINE -1 DNA methylation in leukocytes (Watkins et al., 2014) . This endpoint has been linked to genomic instability, risk of cancer, cerebrovascular outcomes, and serum lipids. Cancer Epidemiologic evidence of PFNA and cancer is available from only one case -control study of prostate cancer (Hardell et al., 2014). This study found no association of PFNA and prostate cancer. Details are provided in the table for this stud y in Appendix 2. As discussed in the Animal Toxicology and Discussion of Uncertainty sections (below), the carcinogenic potential of PFNA has not been evaluated in animals. Summary of epidemiological information Of the endpoints evaluated in the studies reviewed above, the evidence for association with PFNA is strongest for serum cholesterol and ALT. These associations with PFNA are consistent with similar associations for these parameters in most, but not all studies, of PFOA and PFOS - two PFCs that hav e been more widely studied than PFNA. Causality cannot be proven for the associations that were reported since they primarily come from cross -sectional studies. Therefore, human data were not used as the basis for the quantitative risk assessment. Becaus e human epidemiology data were not used as the primary basis for risk assessment, a formal weight of evidence evaluation of causality for the human studies was not conducted. For many of the other endpoints that were evaluated, minimal or no evidence was found for associations with PFNA. For many of these endpoints, the epidemiological data are limited to one or very few studies and are not sufficient to make general conclusions about potential effects of PFNA. For other endpoints such as thyroid hormones, a larger number of studies are available. Some of the endpoints for which no associations were found for PFNA have been associated with other PFCs, including PFOA and PFOS (reviewed by Lau et al., 2012; Post et al., 2012; Gleason et al., 2015) . Results of animal studies and mode of action studies for these PFCs suggest that they cause similar toxicological effects as PFNA. In evaluating the differing results for PFNA and other PFCs, a potentially important consideration is that serum levels of PFNA are lower than for PFOA and PFOS in the general population studies. Additionally, as discussed above, the range of serum PFNA levels in the general population studies is lower than those which would result from exposure to drinking water contaminated from PFOA. There is no information on the potential for PFNA to impact these health endpoints in communities with higher exposures from contaminated drinking water. The health effects of prenatal and early life exposures to environmental contaminants in adulthood a re a current focus of environmental health research (Heindel and Vandenberg, 2015). Only one epidemiology study in which PFNA serum levels were low and fell within a small range, investigated effects of prenatal exposure to PFNA on metabolic effects in ea rly adulthood. Additional research is needed to evaluate the potential of developmental exposures to PFNA to impact health later in life. 38 Animal Toxicology Overview Peer-reviewed toxicology studies of oral or inhalation exposure to PFNA include ten sho rt term (14 day) oral studies, four oral reproductive/developmental studies, and one oral subchronic study, all conducted in rodents, and an acute inhalation study in rats (Kinney et al., 1989). Each of these studies, with the exception of two that asses s only mode of action endpoints (Fang, 2012b, c), is summarized in a separate table in Appendix 3. Summary tables of information on those endpoints of toxicity for which there is sufficient information are included below (Tables 7A-F). The 14 day studies include seven in male rats (Fang et al., 2009; 2010; 2012 a, b, c; Feng et al. , 2009 , 2010 ), two in male mice (Fang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 201 5) and one in both sexes of mice (Kennedy et al., 1987). These short term studies focused on specific endpoi nts of toxicity (e.g. liver, immune system, or testicular), and many of them include mechanistic components intended to elucidate the mode (s) of action for the observed effects. The rat subchronic study (Mertens et al., 2010) used Surflon S -111, a mixture of PFCs consisting primarily of PFNA (see below). The reproductive /developmental studies include a two -generation study in rats dosed with Surflon S -111 (Stump et al., 2008), and studies of gestational exposure to PFNA in CD -1 mice (Das et al., 201 5), wild type and PPAR -alpha knockout mice (Wolf et al., 2010), and rats (Rogers et al., 2014). Other PFNA toxicology studies include five rodent studies using dosing via intraperitoneal injection (Goecke -Flora and Reo, 1996; Kudo et al., 2000, 2001, 2003, 2006; Rockwell et al., 2013), and a 7 day mouse oral gavage study which is available as an abstract (Das et al., 2013). Additionally, results of an unpublished study of Surflon S -111 that included a higher dose than the published studies (Wolterbeek, 2004 ) are discussed by Stump et al. (2008) and Mertens et al. (2010). These studies add to the body of knowledge of effects of PFNA and are discussed in the text. However, they were not considered for use as the basis for the risk assessment because the route of administration is not relevant to environmental exposure or because they were not published in peer reviewed form . For this reason, they are not included in individual study tables (Appendix 3) or the summary tables (Table 7). Importance of serum PF NA data in interpretation of toxicology studies Because the half-life of long -chain PFCs such as PFNA is much longer in humans (several years) than in rats and mice (days to weeks) , a given administered dose ( mg/kg/day) results in a much greater body burde n (as indicated by serum level) in humans than in these animal species. Therefore, comparisons between effect levels in ani mal studies and human exposures are made on the basis of serum levels rather than ad ministered dose. Most of the PFNA toxicology s tudies do not provide serum PFNA data. PFNA serum levels were measured at the same time point as when endpoints of toxicity were assessed in two mouse studies, the developmental study of Das et al. (201 5) and the 14 day study of Wang et al. (201 5). In Da s et al. (201 5) the serum data are presented graphically, and the numerical 39 data used to generate the graphs, including statistical parameters, were provided to the Health Effects Subcommittee. Wang et al. (201 5) provides numerical serum PFNA data but does not include statistical parameters for these data. The only other toxicology studies in which serum PFNA data were reported are the developmental toxicity study in wild type (WT) and PPAR -alpha knockout (KO) mice (Wolf et al., 2010) and the studies of the Surflon S -111 PFC mixture consisting primarily of PFNA (Stump et al., 2008; Mertens et al., 2010). In Wolf et al. (2010), serum PFNA levels were measured 23 days after dosing ended. At this time point, a considerable portion of the PFNA had been excret ed, with additi onal loss of PFNA through transfer to breast milk in the lactating dams. Since these serum levels were not taken at the end of the dosing period, they are not indicative of the maximum exposure levels which may have caused toxicity. Merte ns et al. (2010) present serum PFC levels over time in each dosed gr oup in graphs but do not provi de the numerical data that are needed for dose -respo nse modeling. Additionally, the data for the lower serum levels cann ot be accurately estimated due to the sc ale of the graphs . Stump et al. (2008) provides only area under the curve graphs for serum levels of the Surflon S-111 mixture, and no serum data is presented for individual PFCs. Nu merical serum PFNA data from these studies has been requested from the sponsors of these studies but has not been provided to date . Issues related to interpretation of Surflon S -111 studies The oral subchronic rat study (Mertens et al., 2010) and two-generation oral rat study (Stu mp et al., 2008), used Surflon S -111 (CAS # 7296 8-38-8), a commercial mixture linear perfluori nated carbox ylic acids containing primarily PFNA. These two studies are the only available studies with dosing for more than 18 days. Estimation of PFNA doses The specific composition of the Surflon S -111 used in these studies is not reported; this infor mation has been requested but not provided from the study sponsors to date . The composition of Surflon S -111 by weight was reported by Prevedouros et acid (C12), 0.1%. This composition is assumed in the evaluation of the two studies. In these two studies, the daily doses of PFNA i n the Surflon S -111 were 0.025, 0.125, or 0.6 mg/kg/day. Based on the assumed percentages of PFCs in Surflon S -111 give n above, the doses of PFNA are estimated as 0.019, 0.09, and 0.44 mg/kg/day. For perfluoroundecanoic acid (C11), the next most abundant PFC in the mixture, the doses are estimated as 0.005, 0.025, and 0.12 mg/kg/day, and the PFOA doses are estimated to be about 1% of the PFNA doses (about 0.0002, 0.0009, and 0.004 mg/kg/day). Evaluation of the contribution of PFNA to toxicity of Surflo n S-111 PFC mixture 40 An important issue in interpretation of the two Surflon S -111 studies is whether the toxic effects resulted primarily from PFNA, the major component of Surflon S -111, or from the other PFC(s) present at lower concentration s in the Surfl on S-111 mixture. Information on the relationship between toxicity and the relative ser um levels of PFNA and the other PFCs in the Surflon S -111 mixture in these studies is key to the evaluation of this issue. As discussed above, serum levels of PFOA, PF NA, C11, and C13 in males and females in each dose group over time were presented graphically by Mertens et al. (2010). However, it is not possible to accurately estimate the serum values at lower dose levels from the graphs due to their scale. The nu merical serum data have been requested from the study sponsors but have not been provided to date . Although the serum PFC data presented cannot be completely and precisely interpreted, several important general conclusions can be made from the serum PFC gra phs and the toxicity results. These data suggest that the effects of Sur flon S-111 in Mertens et al. (2010) are, at least primarily, due to PFNA, rather than C11 or the other PFCs prese nt in even lower conce ntrations. Consistent with other pharmacokinetic studies in rats (discussed above), serum PFNA levels in male rats were much higher than in female rats given the same administered dose. In contrast, serum levels of C11 were similar, and generally somewhat higher, in females than in males at the same administered dose. Effects common to both genders (including changes in clinical chemistry parameters, increased liver weight, and increased hepatic beta -oxidation) occurred at lower administered doses in males than females, and some effects (including live r histopatholog y) occurred in males but not in females. The LOAELs and NOAELs for Surflon S and 0.125 mg/kg/day (females) 7 and Appendix 3). At these LOAELs, PFNA serum levels were similar in males and females, while C11 serum levels were about 10 -fold higher in females than in males (at the end of the 90 day study). The PFNA serum levels at the NOAELS are also similar in males and females, based on very rough estimates from the graphs provided. If C11 were a major contributor to the toxicity of Surflon S -111, effects would be expected in 0.125 mg/kg/day females, and a greater response would be expected in 0.6 mg/kg/day fe males than in 0.125 mg/kg/day males. These data suggest that effects of Surflon S -111 are primarily due to PFNA, not C11, assuming that males and females are equally susceptible to the toxicity of these PFCs. In agreement with these conclusions, Mundt et al. (2007) also attribute the greater toxicity of Surflon S -111 in male rats than female rats in the unpublished reports (WIL Research Laboratories, 2006) of the subchronic study (Mertens et al., 2010) to the higher serum PFNA levels in males as compared t o female rats. In the two -generation study (Stump et al., 2008), data on serum levels of PFNA and the other PFCs in the Surflon S -111 mixture are not presented. This information has been reques ted from the study sponsors but has not been provided to date . As was seen in 41 Mertens et al. (2010), effects common to both genders (increased liver and kidney weight, hepatocellular hypertrophy, renal tubule cell hypertrophy) occurred at lower administered doses in males than in females, and other effects (decreas ed body weight, hepatocellular necrosis) occurred only in males. Further more, a recent 7 week oral reproductive/developmental study of C11 in rats (Takahashi et al., 2014) supports the conclusion that C11 is not primarily responsible for the toxicity of the Surflon S -111 mixture. Takahashi et al. (2014) identified 0.1 mg/kg/day as the NOA EL and 0.3 mg/kg/day as the LOAEL for repeated dose toxicity of C11 in males and females, based on the occurrence of centrilo bular hypertrophy of hepatocytes. LOAEL for C11 were identified as 0.3 mg/kg/day and 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, based on decreased body weight at birth and decreased body weight gain at PND 4. As discussed above, the doses of C11 are estimated as 0.005, 0.025, and 0.12 mg/kg/day in the 0.025 mg/kg/day, 0.125 mg/kg/day and 0.6 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111 groups (respectively) in Mertens et al. (2010) and Stump et al. (2008). Although serum levels of C11 were not measured by Takahashi et al. (2014), it is notable that the dose of C11 (0.025 mg/kg/day) at the LOAEL in males in Mertens et al. (2010) is about 10-fold lower than the LOAEL (0.3 mg/kg/day) for systemic toxicity identified by Takah ashi et al. (2014). Similarly, the highest C11 dose in Stump et al. (2008), 0.12 mg/kg/day, was well below the NOAEL for reproductive/developmental toxicity of 0.3 mg/kg/day identi fied by Takahashi et al. (2014). These observations are even more significant because the duration of exposure in Stump et al. (2008) an d Mertens et al. (2010) was several fold longer than in Takahashi et al. (2014). Finally, C11 and C13 were less p otent than PFNA as in vitro activators of PPAR -alpha, a nuclear receptor believed to be involved in many effects of PFCs (discussed in Mode of Action section, below). Based on the information reviewed above, it is concluded that PFNA is likely the primary contributor to the toxicity of Surflon S -111 reported by Stump et al. (2008) and Mertens et al. (2010). 42 Table 7A. Summary of decreased bo dy weight after oral administration of PFNA Citation Species /strain Administered Dose (mg/kg/day) Duration et al.

For some endpoints, there were dose -related trends that included non -statistically significant changes at lower doses. 50 Acute toxicity No studies that determined the acute oral LD 50 of pure PFNA were located. However, Mertens e t al. (2010) state that the \"approximate lethal dose\" (unpublished data, calculated herein as 65 mg/kg) in rats for the Surflon S -111 mixture of PFCs consisting primarily of PFNA (see below) was 2.9 -fold lower than the acute LD50 for PFOA of 198 mg/kg iden tified by Olson and Anderson (1983). The inhalation LC50 in male rats (5 or 6 per group) exposed for 4 hours to six concentrations ranging from 67 to 4600 mg/m3 of ammonium perfluorononanoate (the ammonium salt of PFNA) as a dust was 820 mg/m3; the lowest dose that caused death was 590 mg/m3. Animals were observed for 5 -14 days after exposure and deaths occurred earlier with increas ing dose (Kinney et al., 1989). As has been observed in animals acutely exposed to PFOA (reviewed in Lau et al., 2007; Post et al., 2012) , severe body weight loss occurred in surviving rats of all but the lowest dose group. Mortality Mortality occurred in mice at PFNA doses of 10 mg/kg/day or higher in two 14 day mouse studies. In a 14 day dietary CD-1 mouse study (Kennedy, 198 7), all animals in the 300 and 3000 ppm groups died. The doses at these dietary concentrations are estimated as 45 and 450 mg/kg/day (Appendix 3) . The next lowest dose group, 30 ppm (estimated as 4.5 mg/kg/day) caused weight loss and generalized weakness. Consistent with these results, mortality occurred in 50% of male Balb/C mice dosed with 10 mg/kg/day PFNA for 14 days (Fang et al., 2008). Body weight Effects of PFNA on body weight in mice and rats are summarized in Table 7A. In the rat studies, the d ecreased body weight was not attributable to decreased food consumption, while food consumption was not evaluated in the mouse studies. Weight loss occurred in mice exposed to PFNA at >3 mg/kg/day for 14 days (Kennedy et al., 1987; Wang et al., 201 5; Fang et al., 2008; Fang et al., 2009). In an unpublished study of longer term exposure to Surflon S -111 in rats discussed in Stump et al. (2008) , all males dosed with 2 mg/kg/day for 23 days were euthanized on day 23 due to severe clinical findings (no detail s provided) and severe body weight loss (Wolterbeek, 2004). Decreased body weight gain also occurred in male (but not female) rats with longer exposures to 0.6 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111/0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA (Mertens et al., 2010; Stump et al., 2008). Body weight in rats exposed to this dose remained decreased 60 days after subchronic (90 day) exposure ended (Mertens et al., 2010). Hepatic Toxicity Toxicology data on hepatic effects of PFNA are summarized in Table 7B. Liver enlargement Liver enlarge ment is a well-established effect of PFCs including PFNA (Lau, 2012). PFNA has been evaluated for increased liver weight only in rodents (Table 7B), while PFOA is known to cause this effect in non -human primates as well as rodents (reviewed in Post et al., 2012). As discussed in detail in the Mode of Action section (below), the increased liver weight caused by 51 PFNA in rodents has both P PAR-alpha dependent and PPAR -alpha independent components (Wolf et al., 2010; Rosen et al., 2010). Hepatic beta -oxidation, a marker of PPAR -alpha activation, was significantly increased in male and female rats at the same PFNA doses at which liver weight was increased (Mertens et al., 2010) . The magnitude of increased liver weight was si milar in male and female mice given the same dose (Kennedy, 1987). Since the half-lives of PFNA in male and female mice are similar (see above), these results suggest that male and female mice are equally susceptible to the liver weight increases induced by PFNA. Statistically significant in creases in liver weight occurred at doses as low as 0.2 mg/kg/day in mice in a 14 day study (Wang et al., 201 5) and 0.09 mg/kg/day (0.125 mg/kg/day Surflon S - 111) in rats after 13 week exposure (Mertens et al., 2010). Increased liver weight also occurred in fetuses after in utero exposure and in pups exposed prenatally and through breast milk (Das et al., 201 5; Wolf et al., 2010, discussed in Reproductive/Developmental Toxicity , below). Increased liver weight persists after dosing with PFNA has ended. In male rats dosed for 90 days, increased liver weight persisted at 0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA/0.6 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111 for at least days (about two half -lives for PFNA ; Mertens et al., 2010). In CD -1 mice exposed during pregnancy, dose -related increases in absolute and relative liver weight persisted at 3 and 5 mg/kg/day on PND 28, 4 weeks after the last dose (Das et al., 201 5). Absolute and relative liver weights were also increased on PND 21, 23 days after the last dose, in both WT and PPAR -alpha KO mice gestationally exposed to lower doses of PFOA than those used in the CD-1 mouse study (Wolf et al., 2010). Relative liver weights were increased at all doses (0.83 to 2 mg/kg/day) in non -pregnant WT and PPAR -alpha KO females, with significance in all groups except the lowest dose (0.83 mg/kg /day) PPAR - alpha KO. In mice that had given birth, relative liver weight was significantly increased at all doses in WT, but was not increased in PPAPR -alpha KO at any dose. In interpreting these results, it is importan t to note that in mice that had given birth, PFNA serum levels in the KO mice were much lower than in the WT mice for reason(s) that were not determined. The NOAELs and LOAELs for increased liver weight are consistent in the WT and KO mice on a serum level basis, suggesting that the differences in response is likely due to kinetic differences unrelated to PPAR -alpha status. Serum levels of liver enzymes Increased s erum liver enzymes AST and ALT , an indication of hepatic toxicity, were observed in male mice exposed to 5 mg/kg/day PFNA for 14 days (Wang et al., 201 5). In contrast, these two liver enzymes and GGT were not affected in the 90 day rat study of Surflon S -111 which used lower doses of PFNA (up to 0.44 mg/kg/day; Mertens et al., 2010). Histo pathology Quantitative liver histopathology data (frequency and severity) were reported only for the 90 day subchronic and two -generation studies of Surflon S -111 (Mertens et al., 2010; Stump et al., 2008). Microscopic evaluation of the liver was not perf ormed in other shorter term studies which generally used higher doses, with the exception of the 14 day rat study conducted by Fang et al. (2012 b). Fang et al. ( 2012 b) did not perform a systematic quantitative evaluation for this endpoint and provide only a brief summary of their observations using different 52 terminology to describe the histopathological changes than that used in the Surflon S -111 rat studies. In both the 13 week and two -generation (18 -21 week) rat studies, there were dose -related increa ses in frequency and severity of histopathological changes in liver (Mertens et al., 2010; Stump et al., 2008). These effects occurred at lower doses in the 18 -21 week study (0.019 mg/kg/day PFNA/0.025 mg/kg/day Surflon) than in the 09 mg/kg/day PFNA/0. 125 mg/kg/day Surflon), and a NOAEL was not identified in the longer 18 -21 week study. These results suggest that these effects occur at lower doses when exposure duration is increased from 13 weeks to 18 -21 weeks. Histopathological changes in the liver, including necrosis, occurred in males in the two - generation rat study (Stump et al., 2008) at a dose (Surflon S -111, 0.025 mg/kg/day; PFNA, 0.019 mg/kg/day) below the doses that caused increased liver weight in the same study. Thus, histopat hological changes, including necrosis, were a more sensitive endpoint than increased liver weight in this study. It is important to note that some of the histopathological changes in the liver reported by Fang et al. ( 2012 b), Stump et al. (2008), and Merte ns et al. (2010) are not typically associated with PPAR -alpha activation (peroxisome proliferation and increased smooth endoplasmic reticulum), suggesting that PFNA caused liver toxicity that was independent of PPAR -alpha in these studies. Hepatocellula r hypertrophy occurred at high frequency in both the 13 week study and the 18 -21 week study ( Mertens et al. , 2010 ; Stump et al., 2008). In the 13 week study, the incidence in male rats was 60% at 0.09 mg/kg/day PFNA (0.125 PFNA (0.6 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111) both at the end of dosing and 60 days after exposure ended. In the longer duration (18 -21 week) study, hepatocellular hypertrophy in F 0 and F 1 males occurred at lower doses and higher incidence than in the subchronic (13 week) study (77% doses, 0.09 and 0.4 4 mg/kg/day PFNA (0.125 and 0.6 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111). This effect was not seen in females in the subchronic stud y, but occurred in F 0 females in the longer two-generation study. Hepatocellular hypertrophy was also evident in the photomicrographs of livers from rats treated with PFNA presented by Fang et al. (2012 b), although the authors did not use this term to des cribe their findings (K. Cooper, personal communication). Hepatocellular necrosis occurred only in high dose males in the 13 week study, but was found in all dose groups, with dose -related increases in frequency and severity, in both the F0 and F1 males after longer (18 -21 week) exposure (Mertens et al., 2010; Stump et al., 2008). Other histological changes including infl ammation, clear cell foci, and vacuolation, were also seen in all dosed groups of F0 and F1 males in the two -generation study, with severity and/or incidence increasing with dose. Hepatic and serum glucose/glycogen and lipids Summaries of key findings are shown in Table 7B. Lau (2012) reported that PFOA cause s hepatic lipid accumulation and decreased serum lipids in rodents , and sim ilar effects have been observed in rodents treated with PFNA. In male mice 53 exposed to PFNA for 14 days, triglycerides and total cholesterol were increased in the liver at 0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day, but not at a higher dose, 5 mg/kg/day . In contrast , serum triglycerides and total cholesterol were decreased at 5 mg/kg/day but not at lower doses (Wang et al., 201 5). Serum cholesterol was also decreased in all groups of male rats treated with > 0.1 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111 for 14 days in an unpublished study (Wolterb eek et al., 2004) cited by Mertens et al. (2010). In a study presented in poster/abstract form, hepatic triglyceride levels and lipid accumulation were increased in both SV129 wild type (WT) and PPAR -alpha null (knockout, KO) mice given 10 mg/kg/day PFNA for 7 days (Das et al., 2013). In male rats, there was lipid accumulation in livers at 5 mg/kg/day, but not lower doses (Fang et al ., 2012 b). Potential mode s of action for these effects is discussed in the Mode of Action section (below). In contrast, t otal serum cholesterol was not affected in the 90 day study of Surflon S -111 in rats exposed to lower doses of PFNA (up to 0.44 mg/kg/day) ; serum triglycerides were not measured (Mertens et al., 2010). PFNA caused a dose -related increase in serum glucose, as well as a dose -related decrease in both serum HDL and a decrease in the serum HDL/LDL ratio in male rats dosed with 0.2 -5 mg/kg/day PFNA for 14 days (Fang et al., 2012 a). The authors note that a decreased serum HDL/LDL ratio often accompanies hyperglyce mia. Liver glycogen content was increased in a dose-related manner, and the increase was significant at 5 mg/kg/day. In contrast, no effect on serum glucose was reported in the longer duration (subchronic) rat study at up to 0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA (Mertens et al., 2010). Renal Effects : Kidney weight and histopathology were evaluated in the 13 week and two -generation (18 -21 week) studies of Surflon S -111 in rats (Mertens et al., 2010; Stump et al., 2008). In these studies, renal effects occurred after 18 -21 weeks of exposure, but not after 1 3 weeks of exposure to the same doses. These results suggest that a longer exposure duration is needed to produce renal effects. Renal endpoints were also evaluated in newborn rats exposed during gestation (Rogers et al., 2014; see Reproductive/Developmental section) (Table 7C). In the two -generation study with 18 -21 week exposure (Stump et al., 2008), dose -related increases in kidney weight occurred in F0 and F1 males, and F 0 females. Dose -related increases in renal tubule cell hyper trophy were also found in F 0 and F 1 males in this study. This effect occurred in in 93 -100% of high dose (0.6 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111/0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA) F0 and F 1 at -dose (0.025 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111/0.019 mg/kg/day PFNA) males, an d severity increa sed with dose in the F0 males. Other histopathological effects (renal inflam mation, brown pig ment, and capsular fibrosis) also occurred in a few treated F0 males. Renal tubule cell hypert rophy was also observed in 27% of high dose F0 females. In contrast, there were no effects on kidney weight or renal histopathology in the subchronic (13 week) study. This study us ed the same doses as the two -generation (18 -21 week) study (Mertens et al., 2010). Immune system effects Toxicity to the immune system occurred in three 14 day oral gavage studies using PFNA doses 54 of 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg/day (one in male mice , Fang et a l., 2008 ; and two in male rats , Fang et al., 2009; Fang et al., 2010 ; Table 7D) . Rockwell et al. (2013) also reported immune system toxicity in male and female mice 14 days after a single high intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of PFNA (0.1 mM/kg, calculated as 4 6.4 mg/kg). The longer duration rat studies (Mertens et al., 2010; Stump et al., 2008 ) found no effects on thymus and spleen weight at up to 0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA, but did not evaluate other parameters of immune function (Table 7D). PFNA caused dose -relate d decreases in spleen and/or thymus weights (absolute and relative) in all three 14 day studies. Apoptosis was increased in a dose -related manner in spleens of mice and rats, and in thymus of mice (not evaluated in rats; Fang et al., 2008, 2010). Serum le vels of hormones that suppress the immune system (cortisol in mice and rats; ACTH in rats) were increased by PFNA, and serum levels of cytokines involved with immune system function were affected by PFNA in both species (Fang et al., 2008, 2009). The most sensitive endpoints for immune system toxicity in mice were impairment of cell cycle progression, decreases in specific types of innate immune cells, and decreased interleukin -4 secretion in the spleen (Fang et al., 2008). These three splenic effects occ urred at 1 mg/kg/day, and a NOAEL was not identified. In the rat, the most sensitive endpoints were decreased absolute and relative thymus weight and decreased absolute spleen weight. The LOAEL for these effects was also 1 mg/kg/day with no NOAEL identif ied (Fang et al., 2009; Fang et al., 2010). Other components of these studies related to the modes of action for these effects are discussed in the Mode of Action section (below). In male and female C57Bl /6 mice 14 days after a single i.p. dose of 46.4 mg/kg PFNA, the number of red blood cells and leukocytes in the spleen was reduced by 87.5 -95% and thymocyte viablility was decreased significa ntly. Additionally, other parameters of immune function in the spleen and thymus were affected. This dose caused su bstantial body weight loss (31% in males, 38% in females), an approxi mate 3-fold increase in liver weight/body weight ratio, and a 60-70% decrease in spleen weight/body weight ratio (Rockwell et al., 2013). Male reproductive system effects Three studies in rats found effects of PFNA on the male reproductive syste m at doses < 1 mg/kg/day. PFNA cause d toxicity to the male reproductive system in two 14 day oral gavage studies using dose levels of 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg/day (Feng et al., 2009; Feng et al., 2010 ). Some endpoints related to the male reproductive system were also affected in the two -generation study of Surflon S -111 (Table 7E). Sensitive changes Sertoli cell secretions, reduced sperm motility, and decreased epididymis weight and sperm concentration. PFNA caused dose -related disruption of spermatogenesis and increases in apoptosis in testicular cells of male rats (Feng et al., 2009). Hormones related to reproductive function were also affected. Serum estradiol increased at 5 mg/kg/day, while testosterone was increased at 1 mg/kg/day and decreased at 5 mg/kg/day. These hormones are also affected by other PFCs ; testosterone was decreased in ra ts treated with perfluorodecanoic acid (C10; Bookstaff et al., 1990) and perfluorododecanoic acid (C12; Shi et al., 2009), and estradiol was increased in male rates exposed to PFOA for 1 -12 months in a two year dietary study (Biegel et al., 2001). 55 PFNA also caused ultrastructural changes and effects on multiple functions of Sertoli cells, testicular cells that play a key role in spermatogenesis (Feng et al., 2010). In this study, l evels of four proteins secreted by Sertoli cells in testes or serum were affected by 1 mg/kg/day PFNA, with no NOAEL identified. These include increases in Mullerian inhibiting substance and Wilms tumor protein (both involved with regulation of testosterone production and spermatogenesis ), and decreases in transferrin (deliver s iron needed for sperm production ), and the glycoprotein inhibin B (modulates FSH secretion ) which is considered to be a marker of testicular toxicity in rodents . Effects on the male reproductive system were also reported in rats after 18 -21 weeks of e xposure to Surflon S -111 in the two -generation study (Stump et al., 2008). S -111) F1 males. Although it is stated that this effect is not test related because reproductive organ weights were not affected, the data tables show significa ntly decreased left epididy mis weight in F 0 and F1 males, and significantly decreased left epididy mis sperm concentration in F0 males, . Reproductive/developmental studies of reproductive and developmental effects of PFNA have been conducted (Table 7F). A study of CD -1 mice with gestational exposure to PFNA (1 -10 mg/kg/day) evaluated reproductive outcomes, fetal abnormalities, and postnatal development (Das et al, 201 5; previously reported as Lau et al., 2009). Since PPAR -alpha is known to mediate some of the developmental effects of the related compound PFOA, a second study in wild typ e (WT) and PPAR -alpha null (\"knockout\", KO) strains of mice was undertaken to elucidate the role of PPAR -alpha in develop mental toxicity of PFNA (0.83 to 2 mg/kg/day ; Wolf et al., 2010) . The designs of these two mouse studies were similar to the analogous studies of PFOA at higher doses in CD -1 mice (1 -40 mg/kg/day) and WT and KO mice (0.1 -20 mg/kg/day) from the same laboratory (Lau et al., 2006; Abbott et al., 2007). A two -generation study of Surflon S - 111 (0.019 -0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA) assessed reproductive parameters and postnatal development in rats (Stump et al., 2008). Finally, a study using only one dose level of PFNA (5 mg/kg/day) in rats exposed on GD 1 -20 focused on endpoints related to elevated blood pressure in offspring ( blood pressure, nephron e ndowment, renal glucocorticoid receptor mRNA level; Rogers et al., 2014). As discussed below, several developmental endpoints affected by PFNA in mice were not impacted by PFNA in rats (Stump et al., 2008; Wolf et al., 2010; Das et al., 201 5). As is the case for PFOA, PFNA is excreted much more quickly in female rats than in female mice or male rats (see Toxicokinetics , above). Thus, the rat may not be the most appropriate model for evaluation of develop mental effects of PFNA because the developing rat fetus receives a much lower dose than the developing mouse fetus at the same maternally administered dose. PFNA in serum and liver in reproductive/developmental studies As discussed above, comparisons between effect levels among ani mal studies of PFNA are most appropriately made on the basis of serum levels rather than ad ministered dose. PFNA 56 levels in serum and liver are reported in the two mouse studies (Das et al., 201 5; Wolf et al., 2010), but were not reported in the rat studies (Stump et al., 200 8; Rogers et al., 2014). Das et al. (201 5) measured PFNA levels in liver and serum in adult females and in fetal livers on GD 17 (one day after dosing ended), in adult females sacrificed on PND 28 (four weeks after dosing ended), and in pups on PND 1, 10, 24, 42, and 70. In Wolf et al. (2010), serum PFNA was measured in adult females and in two pups per litter only on PND 21 ( 23 days a fter the last dose). While PFNA was not measured in breast milk in the mouse studies, the transfer of PFOA to milk in mic e and the presence of PFCs including PFNA in human breast milk (discussed above) are well established (reviewed in White et al., 2011; Post et al., 2012). Exposure to PFNA in pups is therefore assumed to result from both in utero exposure to the PFNA ad ministe red to the mothers during pregnancy and from PFNA that was trans ferred to the breast milk after maternal dosing had ended. The maternal serum data from GD 17 (one day after dosing ended) in CD -1 mice (Das et al., 2015) are valuable for quantitative risk assessment (see below) because they provide information on the maximum internal PFNA exposure to these mice at a time point when an endpoint for toxicity (maternal liver weight) was assessed. On GD 17, PFNA levels increased with dose in both serum and liver from pregnant and non -pregnant adult females , and in fetal livers. Serum levels were higher in non -pregnant than in pregnant adult female mice, with the lower levels in the pregnant mice presumably due to transfer to the fetal compartment. On PND 28 (post -weaning, four weeks after dosing ended ), serum levels were lower in dams that had nursed than in pregnant mice on GD 17 at 1 and 3 mg/kg/day, but were similar in pregnant GD17 versus post -weaning adult females at 5 mg/kg/day (Das et al., 201 5). Although these PND 28 data do not reflect the maximum internal PFNA exposures which may have caused toxicity, they do provide information on the time course of internal exposure and the persistence of PFNA in these mice. PFNA concentrations in liver gene rally paralleled serum levels in pregnant, non -pregnant, and post -weaning (PND 28) female adults and were several fold higher than serum PFNA levels in the same animals (Das et al., 201 5). The PFNA levels in fetal livers on GD 17 were similar to the mater nal serum levels at the same time point. Serum levels in offspring soon after birth (PND 1) were close to or higher than maternal serum levels at a similar time point (GD 17). In offspring, PFNA levels in serum and liver decreased over time, with a sl ower decline in liver than in serum. At PND 1, PFNA levels in liver were about 3 -fold higher than in serum. By PND 70, PFNA in serum had decreased to about 4 -7% of PND 1 levels, while liver PFNA concentrations on PND 70 were about 12 -18% of PND 1 levels. PFNA persisted at low levels in liver and serum of treated offspring until 43 weeks (10 months), the last time point assessed. In male offspring at age 10 months, PFNA in serum was about 1% of PND 1 levels, while levels in liver were about 2 -4% of PND 1 levels; liver and serum levels in female offspring were lower than in males at this time point. (Numerical 57 data obtained from C. Lau). In the study of WT and PPAR -alpha KO mice (Wolf et al., 2010), serum PFNA was measured in adult females and in two pups per litter on PND 21 ( 23 days a fter the last dose). The serum levels measured at this time point in the adult females would be considerably lower than at the end of the dosing period. This decrease reflects excretion of PFNA in all adult females (preg nant and non -pregnant), as well as transfer to breast milk in those adult females which had delivered and nursed live pups. These serum levels thus do not reflect the maximum internal PFNA exposure s which may have resulted in the observed toxicity and are not appropriate for use in quantitative risk assessment. However, these data are useful for comparison of the dose - response for toxicity in the two strains of mice (WT and PPAR -alpha KO) on the basis of internal, rather than external dose. Notably, in mi ce that had given birth, PFNA serum levels in the KO strain were much lower than in the WT strain given the same dose of PFNA, for reason(s) that were not determined. Maternal weight gain and pregnancy outcome In CD -1 mice, PFNA at 10 mg/kg/day cause d substantial maternal weight loss and 100 % full litter resorptions (Das et al., 201 5). At lower doses ( <5 mg/kg/day), maternal body weight gain was not affected, and there were no significant effects on reproductive parameters ( full litter resorptions, the number of implants, number or percent live fetuses, prenatal liver loss, or fetal weight; Das et al, 201 5). The study of WT and PPAR -alpha KO mice suggests that PFNA caused both PPAR dependent and PPAR -alpha independent reproductive effects. PFNA ( < 2 mg/kg/day) did not affect maternal weight gain, number of uterine implants, or nu mber of live plus dead pups per litter in either strain of mice . In WT mice, t he number of live pups at birth was decreased at all doses (significant at some doses ), and p ercent litter loss was increased at the highest PFNA dose, although this change was not significant (Wolf et al., 2010). Pregnancy rate was significantly (p<0.001) reduced in the PPAR -alpha KO mice, but was not affected in WT mice, suggesting that PFNA affects implantation in the absence of functioning PPAR -alpha (Wolf et al., 2010). In the two -generation rat study of Surflon S -111, the fertility index was significant ly decreased only in the low dose (0.025 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111/ 0.019 mg/kg/day P FNA) F0 males and females. No effects were seen on other reproductive parameters in F0 or F 1 rats. There were no effects on maternal weight gain or other para meters such as nu mber of pups born and live litter size at any dose (Stump et al., 2008). Matern al weight gain was significantly decreased in rats given a higher dose of PFNA, 5 mg/kg/day , on GD 1 -20 (Rogers et al., 2014). Fetal abnormalities Exposure to PFNA did not increase fetal skeletal or visceral abnormalities in fetuses in CD -1 mice (Das et al., 201 5). These endpoints were not evaluated in the other reproductive/developmental studies. 58 Neonatal and postnatal mortality PFNA caused neonatal mortality in gestationally exposed mouse pups , and this effect appears to be dependent on PPAR -alpha. In CD -1 mice, pup survival was severely affected at 5 mg/kg/day , while this dose did not affect maternal weight gain, cause overt maternal toxicity, or impact pregnancy outcome (Das et al., 2015). Fewer than 20% of the 5 mg/kg/day pups survived to PND 21, compared to greater than 80% of the controls. The neonatal mortality in the 5 mg/kg/day offspring was gradual, with a sharp increase in pup deaths throughout the first 10 days of life. These pups were weak and failed to thrive, although lack of ma ternal care was not observed. Furthermore, milk was present in the stomachs of the pups after death, indicating that they had been able to suckle and swallow (C. Lau, personal communication). Das et al. (201 5) contrast the neonatal mortality from 5 mg/k g/day PFNA on PND 2 -10 to the findings in similar studies with PFOA and PFOS conducted in the same laboratory ( Lau et al., 2003; Lau et al., 2006). These other PFCs caused neonatal mortality in mice in the first two days of life at higher doses (10 -20 mg/ kg/day), but mortality did not continue to occur at later time points. Das et al. (201 5) suggest that the neonatal deaths in the 5 mg/kg/day PFNA pups may be due to effects on intermediary metabolism (i.e. the utilization of nutrients to produce energy needed for growth through glycolysis and other metabolic pathways). This conclusion is supported by studies showing that PFNA is more potent than PFOA or PFOS as an activator of PPAR -alpha, a receptor that is involved with regulation of intermediary metab olism (discussed in the Mode of Action section below). In the study of WT and PPAR -alpha KO mice (Wolf et al., 2010), the number of live pups at birth and pup survival from birth to weaning was reduced in a dose-related fashion at all PFNA doses in WT groups ; these decreases were significa nt at the two highest doses. Most pup deaths occurred within the first few post natal days, and WT pup survival at PND 21 was reduced to 36% at 1.5 mg/kg/day and 31% at 2 mg/kg/day. These parameters were not affected by PFNA in the PPAR -alpha KO mice. There were no effects on postnatal survival in F1 or F2 pups in the two -generation rat study that used doses up to 0.44 mg/kg/day (Stump et al., 2008), and this endpoint was not assessed in the study of rats exposed to 5 m g/kg/day during pregnancy (Rogers et al., 2014). Pup Body Weight Body weights of CD -1 mouse pups on PND 1 -24 were decreased by PFNA in a dose-related fashion at all doses, with statistical significance at 3 and 5 mg/kg/day (Das et al., 201 5). At weani ng, body weight decreases were substantial (27% and 50% lower than in controls at 3 and 5 mg/kg/day , respectively). These statistically significant body weight decrements persisted in both male and female offspring after weaning, and remained statisticall y significant in males until PND 287 (9 months of age) when most of the PFNA had been eliminated. It is the opinion of the study authors that the body weight decrements at 9 months of age are unlikely to be attributable to the low concentrations of PFNA re maining in the body at this time point (C. Lau, personal 59 communication). These persist ent delays in growth f rom PFNA are in contrast to the findings in a PFOA study of similar design in CD -1 mice in the same laboratory (Lau et al., 2006). In the PFOA stu dy, body weights of pups from mothers dosed with 3 or 5 mg/kg/day during gestation were 25-30% lower than controls at weaning, but recovered and reached contr ol levels by age 6.5 weeks in males and 13 weeks in females. Pup weight at birth was not affected by PFNA ( < 2 mg/kg/day) in WT or KO mice (Wolf et al., 2010). Weight gain from birth until weaning was reduced in male and female WT pups at 2 mg/kg/day, but not at lower doses in WT or at any dose in PPAR -alpha KO pups. In rats, there were no effects on body weight through weaning in F1 or F2 pups in the two -generation study at doses up to 0.44 mg/kg/day (Stump et al., 2008) or at PND 21 through 56 weeks of age in offspring exposed gestat ionally to a higher dose, 5 mg/kg/day (Rogers et al., 2014). Developmental Delays Markers of postnatal development were evaluated in three reproductive/developmental studies (Das et al., 201 5; Wolf et al., 2010; Stump et al., 2008) , but were not evaluated by Rogers et al. (2014). In CD -1 mice, PFNA caused dose -dependent delays in day of eye open ing, day of vaginal opening, and day of preputial separation, with statistically significant delays for all three endpoi nts in the 3 and 5 mg/kg/day PFNA groups (Das et al., 201 5). The magnitude of these delays at 3 mg/kg/ day PFNA were similar to those at the highest dose (20 mg/kg/day) in the analogous PFOA study (Lau et al., 2006), while 5 mg/kg/day PFNA caused much greater delays than 20 mg/kg/day PFOA (Table 8). Table 8. Comparison of developmental delays in CD -1 mice from PFNA and PFOA Endpoint PFNA (Das et al., 201 5) PFOA (Lau et al., 2006) 3 mg/kg/day 5 mg/kg/day 20 mg/kg/day Eye opening 2 days 5 days ~3 days Vaginal opening 3 days 7 days ~3 days Preputial Separation 2 days 5 days ~1 day Day of eye openin g was also significantly delayed at 2 mg/kg/day PFNA in WT pups , but was not affected at lower doses in WT pups or at any dose in PPAR -alpha KO pups (Wolf et al., 2010). The other developmental endpoints evaluated by Das et al. (201 5) were not assessed by Wolfe et al. (2010) . In the two -generation rat study (Stump et al., 2008), day of preputial separation and vaginal opening were not affected in F1 pups at doses up to 0.44 mg/kg/day . These endpoints were not assessed in F2 pups, and day of eye opening w as not evaluated. 60 Effects on liver weight in adults, fetuses, and offspring Adult females Effects on liver weight in adult females in the three reproductive/developmental studies are summarized in the section on Hepatic Toxicity and Table 7B (above ). They are discussed in more detail below because this endpoint is the basis for the quantitative risk assessment for PFNA (below). Liver weight was not assessed by Rogers et al. (2014). Absolute and relative liver weights were statistically significan tly increased in a dose -related fashion at all doses in pregnant and non -pregnant female CD -1 mice on GD 17 (Das et al, 201 5). Maternal serum levels were also measured at this time point (discussed above). Dose -related statistically significant increases in absolute and relative liver weight persisted at the two higher doses (3 and 5 mg/kg/day) in dams on PND 28 (4 weeks after dosing ended). Absolute and relative liver weights were increased by PFNA on PND 21 (23 days after the last dose) in both WT and PPAR -alpha KO mice (Wolf et al., 2010). Relative liver weights were increased at all doses in non -pregnant WT and PPAR -alpha KO mice, with significance in all groups except the lowest dose PPAR -alpha KO. In mice that had given birth, relative liver weigh t was significantly increased at all doses in WT, but was not increased in PPAPR -alpha KO at any dose. In interpreting these results, it is important to note that in mice that had given birth, PFNA serum levels in the KO mice were much lower than in the WT mice for reason(s) that were not determined. The NOAELs and LOAELs for increased liver weight based on serum levels are consistent in the se WT and KO mice, suggesting that the differences in response is likely due to kinetic differences unrelated to PPAR -alpha status. Absolute and relative liver weights were also increased in F 0 and F 1 females exposed to 0.6 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111 (0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA) for 18 -21 weeks at post -weaning sacrifice (Stump et al., 2014). Lower dose groups were not evaluated. Fetal liver weights In CD -1 mice, absolute and relative fetal liver weights were significantly increased at all doses of PFNA, except that the increase in absolute liver weight was not significant at 5 mg/kg/day. The magnitude of the increases in l iver weight was similar in all dose groups (Das et al., 201 5). This endpoint was not evaluated in the other t hree reproductive/developmental studies. Pup liver weights Pup liver weight was evaluated at PND 1, 10, 24, 42, and 70 in CD -1 mice (Das et al ., 201 5), on PND 21 in WT and PPAR -alpha KO mice (Wolf et al., 2010), and on PND 21in F1 and F2 rats (Stump et al, 2008). This endpoint was not assessed by Rogers et al. (2014). In CD -1 mouse pups, relative liver weights were increased in a dose-related fashion on PND 1 through PND 70. These increases were significant at all doses (1, 3, and 5 mg/kg/day) on PND 1 and 24, and at 3 and 5 mg/kg/day on PND 42 (Das et al., 2015). In the study of WT and KO mice , relative liver weight on PND 21 was increased at all doses ( > 0.83 mg/kg/day) in WT mice but only at the highest dose (2 mg/kg/day) in PPAR -alpha KO mice (Wolf et al., 2010). 61 In rats in the two generation study, relative liver weights on PND 21 were significantly increased at > 0.125 mg/kg/day Surflo n S-111 (0.09 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111 (0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA) in F 2 pups. Elevated blood pressure in offspring This endpoint was evaluated only by Rogers et al. (2014). Systolic blood pressure was significantly inc reased on PND 10 in male and female rat pups after gestational exposure to 5 mg/kg/day PFNA. Blood pressure was not increased at later time points (PND 26 and 56). In male pups, nephron endowment (number of functioning nephrons present at birth) in renal glomeruli was significantly decreased when evaluated on PND 22; no effect was observed in female pups. These changes in nephron endowment were not associated with changes in body weight or kidney weight. Summary of reproductive/developmental effects In both mouse studies, PFNA caused dose -dependent maternal and developmental effects including postnatal mortality, decreased pup weight gain, and delays in reaching markers of development (Das et al., 2015; Wolf et al., 2010). It is notable that decreased growth from developmental exposure persisted well into adulthood (age 9 months), long after PFNA had been eliminated from the serum (Das et al., 201 5). Both Das et al. (201 5) and Wolf et al. (2010) conclude that PFNA is more potent than PFOA as a develop mental toxicant, based on studies of PFOA in the same strains of mice used in the PFNA studies (Lau et al., 2006 ; Abbott et al., 2007). The greater toxicity of PFNA as compared to PFOA is likely related to both its greater intrinsic potency and longer pers istence in the body. As discussed in the Mode of Action section below, PPAR -alpha is considered to have an important role in human reproduction and development (Abbott, 2009). Develop mental parameters (number of live pups per litter, pup survival, day of eye opening, pup weight gain) were adversely affected by PFNA only in the WT mice (Wolf et al., 2010). Based on higher serum levels in PPAR -alpha KO pups than WT pups, the authors conclude that the lack of effects in PPAR -alpha KO pups is not attributable to lower PFNA levels in their serum. The develop mental effects of PFNA seen in this study thus appear to be dependent on PPAR -alpha. In contrast, pregnancy rate was significantly affected by PFNA in the PPAR -alpha KO but not the WT strain, suggesting that the presence of functioning PPAR -alpha prevents this effect. Decreased maternal body weight gain, decreased neonatal weight, and delayed development of pups (reduced body weight gain, delayed age of markers development) were not observed in the rat two -generation study (Stump et al., 2008), although a higher dose of PFNA (5 mg/kg/day) caused decreased maternal weight gain and decreased pup weight at birth in rats (Rogers et al., 2014). Relevant to this point, the highest dose used in the rat two-generati on study (0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA) was lower than the lowest doses in the mouse studies (0.83 and 1 mg/kg/day) and PFNA serum data are not available for this study. These results from develop mental studies of PFNA in rats and mice are consistent with results in mice and rats for the related compound, PFOA (reviewed in Post et al., 2012). As is the case for PFOA, the rat may not be an appropriate model for assess ment of develop mental effects of PFNA bec ause it is eliminated much more rapidly in female rats than in female mice (see Toxicokinetics , above). For this reason, the developing rat fetus receives a much lower dose than the developing mouse 62 fetus at the same maternally administered dose. Additional considerations related to developmental toxicity The potential for PFNA to cause the specific low-dose develop mental effects seen in mice given 0.01 mg/kg/day of the closely related compound, PFOA, including delayed mammary gland develop ment and histopathological effects on fe male reproductive system (review ed in Post et al., 2012; Tucker et al., 2014), has not been evaluated. Other long chain PFCs, including PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS, caused neurobehavioral effects in mice after developmental exposures (Johansson et al., 2008: Viberg et al., 2013), but PFNA has not been tested for these effects. Additional systemic endpoints In the subchronic and the two -generation studies of Surflon S -111 in rats (Mertens et al., 2010; Stump et al., 2008), effects were reported on several endpoints that were not included in ot her toxicology studies. Hematology In the subchronic study (Mertens et al., 2010), several hematological parameters were affected in the high dose (0.6 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111; 0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA) males at the end of the 13 week dosing and/or after the recovery period at week 21. These include increased prothro mbin time and lymphocytes, and decreased red cells, he moglobin, and hematocrit, and reticulocytes. No effects were seen in females. Clinic al Chemistry In the high dose (0.6 mg/kg/day Surflon S-111/0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA ) (Mertens et al., 2010), serum protein and globulin were decreased, while bilirubin, BUN, chloride (data not shown), and alkaline phosphatase were increased. In S -111/0.09 PFNA) females, only increased alkaline phosphatase and decreased globulin were observed. The effects on these clinical chemistry para meters were more pronounced in males than females. In an unpublished study of Surflon S -111 in male rats (Wolterbeek, 2004), serum phospholipids, cholesterol, and calcium were decreased in male rats in all dose groups (0.1, 0.5, and 2 mg/kg/day) after 14 days of exposure. Calcium and cholesterol were not affected in the 90 day study and phospholipids were not measured (Mertens et al., 2010). Gastroint estinal Effects Inflam mation, ulceration, erosion, and hyperplasia occurred in the duodenum and stomach of some males in the 0.6 mg/ kg/day Surflon S -111 (0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA) group. Mini mal stomach erosion persist ed in one male in the recovery group. In females, only the control and high dose (0.6 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111, 0.44 mg/kg/day PFNA) were evaluated, and these effects were not seen. Histopathological examination of the gastrointestinal organs was not performed in the rat two generation study of Surflon S -111 (Stump et al., 2010). Chronic effects and carcino genicity Chronic studies, including studies designed to detect carcinog enicity have not been conducted 63 for PFNA. PFOA and PFOS, the two long -chain biologically persistent PFCs for which chronic studies have been conducted, caused tumors in rats (Sibinski, 1987; Biegel et al., 2001; Thomford, 2002). Summary of toxicity in e xperimental ani mals PFNA and/or Surflon S -111 (a mixture of PFCs consisting primarily of PFNA) caused multiple toxic effects in rats and mice. Detailed evaluation of the results of the Surflon S -111 studies support the conclusion that its toxicity is prima rily caused by PFNA. Effects of PFNA (and/or Surflon S -111) in rodents include body weight loss, increased liver weight and histopathological changes in the liver including necrosis, increased kidney weight and histopathological changes in the kidney, atr ophy of spleen and thymus and changes in immune cell populations in these organs, histopathological changes and other effects in the testes, decreased pregnancy rate, maternal weight loss and full litter resorptions, neonatal and postnatal mortality, decre ased weight gain persisting into adulthood in offspring, and delays in reaching markers of postnatal development. Reproductive/developmental studies of both PFNA and the closely related compound, PFOA, have been conducted in CD -1 mice and in WT and PPA R-alpha KO mice. Comparison of the results of the studies of these two compounds indicates that PFNA is more toxic to reproduction and development than PFOA. Similarly, authors of the subchronic and two generation rat studies of Surflon S -111 concluded t hat Surflon S -111 is more toxic than PFOA, based on comparison with similar studies of PFOA in rats (Mertens et al., 2010; Stump et al., 2008). Notably, similar decreases in body weight in males occurred from 0.6 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111 (0.44 mg/kg/day PF NA) and 30 mg/kg/day PFOA in two generation studies (Stump et al., 2008). The greater toxicity of PFNA as compared to PFOA is likely due to both its longer persistence in the body and its higher intrinsic potency. PFNA causes both PPAR -alpha dependent and PPAR -alpha toxicity , as is also true for PFOA. PFNA caused increased liver weight (adult, fetal, and pup) in both WT and PPAR - alpha KO mice. Some developmental/reproductive effects (number of live pups per litter, pup survival, day of eye opening, pup weight gain) occurred only in WT mice. Based on knowledge of the role of PPAR -alpha in human reproduction and development, these PPAR -alpha dependent effects are considered relevant to humans. In contrast, pregnancy rate was decreased by PFNA only in PPAR -alpha KO mice. Additionally, PFNA caused hepatic necrosis, an effect not typically associated with PPAR -alpha activation, at a dose which did not increase liver weight in rats exposed for 18 -21 weeks. Some endpoints of toxicity, including inc reased kidney weight and histopathological changes in the kidney, occurred after 18 -21 weeks of exposure in the two -generation study, but not in the 13 week subchronic study which used the same doses of Surflon S -111. Furthermore, hepatic necrosis occurred only at the highest dose in the 13 week study but at all doses in the 18 -21 week study. These results suggest that 13 weeks not a sufficient exposure duration to produce some of the effects that occur from longer exposures, and that toxicity occurs at low er doses from exposures longer than 13 weeks. 64 The half -life of PFNA differs among species and is much shorter in female rats than male rats. As expected from the rapid excretion of PFNA in female rats, higher administered doses were required to cause toxi city in female rats than in male rats. Similarly, reproductive and developmental effects occurred at higher administered doses in rats than in mice, a species in which females excrete PFNA slowly. Because of the large differences in excretion rates in species and genders, quantitative risk assessment and extrapolation to human exposure levels are most appropriately based on internal dose (serum level) rather than administered dose. PFNA serum levels were evaluated in one 14 day study in male mice and two reproductive/developmental stud ies in mice. Additionally, serum levels that can be roughly estimated from graphs provided in the subchronic rat study are useful for comparison to other studies but are not appropriate for quantitative risk assessment. Although the studies that do not provide data on PFNA serum levels are not appropriate as the basis for quantitative risk assessment, results of some of these studies suggest that PFNA causes toxicity at similar or lower internal doses lower than in the s tudies of similar duration which do provide serum levels. These results (discussed in detail above ) include increased liver weight at 0.45 mg/kg/day in mice dosed for 21 days (Kennedy, 1987); increased serum glucose and other effects at 1 mg/kg/day, and related bioche mical effects at 0.2 mg/kg/day, in mice dosed for 14 days (Fang et al., 2012a); immunotoxicity at 1 mg/kg/day in mice dosed f or 14 days (Fang et al., 2008); and damage to testicular Sertoli cells and other related effects at 1 mg/kg/day in rats dosed for 14 days. Additionally Stump et al. (2008) and Mertens et al. (2010) discuss an unpublished study (Wolterbeek, 2004) in which serum cholesterol, calcium, and phospholipids were decreased in male mice dosed with 0.1 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111, a PFC mixture containing primarily PFNA, for 14 days. There are several important data gaps in the toxicity information available for PFNA. Chronic studies, including studies designed to detect carcinogenicity, have not been conducted. The two other long c hain PFCs (PFOA and PFOS) that have been tested chronically caused tumors in rats. Furthermore , additional non-carcinogenic toxic ity from longer exposure durations may occur with chronic exposure. A two -generation study of PFNA in a species, such as the mouse, that is appropriate for evaluating reproductive/developmental effects has not been conducted. Additionally, the potential for PFNA to cause the specific low-dose develop mental effects seen in mice at low doses of PFOA, including delayed mammary gland develop ment, has not been evaluated. Finally, PFNA has not been tested for developmental neurotoxicity, such as has been found in studies of other long chain PFCs. MODE OF ACTION Although there is a considerable body of info rmation on the mode(s) of action (MOA) for PFNA and other PFCs, the MOA of these compounds has not been fully characterized. Perfluorinated carboxylic acids such as PFNA structurally resemble free fatty acids, and thus may act similarly to a free fatty acid in activating nuclear receptors such as PPAR -alpha, CAR (constit utive androsta ne receptor) and PXR (pregnane X receptor), binding to transporters and carrier proteins, and interac ting with membranes (Butenhoff, 2009). However, PFNA and 65 other PFCs are non-reactive and thus are not substrates for bioche mical reactions involving fatty acids. Genotoxicity In general, because PFNA and other PFCs are non-reacti ve and are not metabolized to reactive intermediat es, they do not covalently bind to nucleic acids and proteins and are therefore unlikely to be genotoxic. PFOA and PFOS were not mutagenic in several in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells, and did not induce micronuclei in mice in vivo (reviewed by USEPA, 2005; ATSDR, 2009). Only one study of the genotoxic potential of PFNA was located (Eriksen et al., 2010). this PFHxA (C6), PFOS, and perfluorobutane evaluated for their potential to generate reactive oxygen species and cause oxidative DNA damage in human HepG2 cell s. Of the PFCs tested, only PFNA caused a modest but statistically significant increase in DNA strand breaks at concentrations of 100 \u00b5M and 400 \u00b5M, but this effect of PFNA was not related to generation of reactive oxygen species. Although it was stated that PFNA increased strand breaks only at cytoto xic concent rations, this point is uncle ar because cytotoxicity did not occur at 100 \u00b5M PFNA. -alpha, as w ell as other nuclear recept ors such as con stitutive androsta ne recept or (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR), in rodents (Rosen et al., 2010; Das et al., 2015). These receptors are found in many tissues, and activation of these receptors affects the expression of genes involved in many pathways related to carcinogenicity, hepatotoxicity, metabolic functions, develop mental toxicity, immunotoxi city, and other effects (Lau, 2012). Like other long chain PFCs, PFNA increases the activity of hepatic a m arker and rats and Kudo et 2006; Mertens et al., 2010). PFNA indu ced the expression of genes in functi onal categories normally associat ed with PPAR -alpha in both WT and PPAR -alpha KO mice, suggesting that other PPAR isofo rms (i.e. beta, delta , and/or gamma) present in the PPAR -alpha KO mice are activated by PFNA (Rosen et al., 2010). Genes a ssociated with CAR were also activated by PFNA i n WT and PPAR -alpha KO mice (Rosen et al., 2010). PPAR -alpha is found in human liver, and fibrate drugs bring about decreases in cholesterol and lipids in humans through activation of hepatic PPAR -alpha. However, the human relevance of hepatic toxicity in rodents by environmental contaminants that activate PPAR -alpha has been subject to debate because of the lower levels and/or lower intrinsic activity of PPAR -alpha in human liver (reviewed in Post et al., 2012). The hepatic effects of PFNA in rodents have both PPAR-alpha dependent and PPAR -alpha independent components (Rosen et al., 2010; Wolf et al., 2010) . Absolute and relative liver weights were increased by PFNA in both wild type (WT) and PPAR -alpha knockout (KO) mice (Wolf et al., 2010). In mice that had given birth, the magnitude of increased liver weight in WT and KO mice were similar when the two strains were compared on the basis of PFNA serum levels 23 days after dosing ended (Wolf et al., 2010). Additionally, PFNA caused hepatic necrosis, a n effect not typically associated with PPAR -alpha activation, at a dose which did not increase liver weight in rats exposed for 18 -21 weeks (Stump et al., 2008). 66 Furthermore, i t is well established that the observed hepatic toxicity of the closely related compound, PFOA , also has both PPAR -alpha dependent and PPAR -alpha independent components (reviewed in Post et al., 2012). Two recent studies provide important additional data related to this issue. In CD -1 mice exposed in utero to PFOA, hepatocellular hy pertrophy was observed at 3 and 13 weeks of age. These changes were accompanied by mitochondrial alterations in the liver cells, while there was no evidence of hepatic peroxisome proliferation, a marker of PPAR -alpha activation (Quist et al., 201 5). A sec ond study evaluated liver lesions at age 18 months in CD -1, WT, and PPAR -alpha KO mice with prenatal exposure to PFOA (Filgo et al., 201 5). Liver carcinomas and/or adenomas did not occur in controls in any of the three mouse strains, but were found in PFOA -treated CD -1 and PPAR -alpha KO more frequent and/or more severe in PPAR -alpha KO than WT mice. Wang et al . (201 5) found that PFNA increased hepatic lipids only at lower doses (0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day, but not 5 mg/kg/day). In contrast, serum lipids were decreased only at the two highest doses. PFNA affected expression of genes and proteins leading to up -regulat ion of both PPAR -alpha and hepatic and serum lipids, while SREBPs have the opposite effect, promotion of lipid biosynthesis l eading to increased hepatic and serum lipids. Wang et al. (201 5) concluded that the different changes in serum and hepatic lipids at low versus high PFNA doses may result from the balance between these opposing effects. A potential explanation for the inc reased serum levels from PFNA and other PFCs in humans, but not rodents , is that these the balance between lipolysis and lipid biosynthesis may differ in these species due to interspecies differences in PPAR -alpha versus SREPBs. Some developmental/repro ductive of PFNA (number of live pups per litter, pup survival, day of eye opening, pup weight gain) occurred only in WT mice and appear to be PPAR -alpha dependent, while pregnancy rate was decreased by PFNA only in PPAR -alpha KO mice. The uncertain ty about human relevance of hepatic effects of PPAR -alpha does not apply to PPAR - alpha's role in developmental toxicity and other non -hepatic effects , or to other PPAR -alpha and other PPAR isofo rms are expressed in many fetal and adult tissues in rodents and humans (Abbott et al., 2010). Based on their physiological roles, PPAR -alpha and other forms of PPAR are expected to have important roles in reproduction and develop ment in these species (Abbott, 2009). In regard to human relevance of PPAR -alpha mediated effects of PFNA on development in mice, Wolf et al. (2010) state: \"Relevance of the PPAR -alpha mechanism to humans has been criticized primarily based on the lower number of these receptors in the liver of human versu s mouse. However, PPAR is implicated here in the developmental effects of PFNA as well, and the etiology of PPAR in other tissues of the embryo, fetus and neonate of the human and the mouse that are involved in gross development has not been fully determined. The refore, the possibility of relevance of PPAR to a human response to PFNA cannot be dismissed.\" Additionally, the USEPA Science Advisory Board (2006) concluded that available data are insufficient to dismiss the relevance of the PPAR -alpha MOA in children. 67 Das et al. (201 5) suggest that the neonatal deaths in the 5 mg/kg/day PFNA pups may be due to effects on intermediary metabolism (i.e. the utilization of nutrients to produce energy needed for growth through glycolysis and other metabolic pathways). Gene expression profiles in livers from fetuses and pups exposed to PFNA during gestation showed activation of expression of genes related to homeostatic control of lipid and glucose metabolism, including PPAR -alpha, CAR, and PXR (Das et al., 201 5). A similar hypothesis has been suggested for the neonatal mortality and decreased pup growth caused by PFOA. Like PFNA, gestational exposure to PFOA affected the expression of genes associated with PPAR -alpha, other PPARs, CAR, and PXR, in both fetal and neonatal mi ce (Rosen et al., 2007; Abbott et al., 2010). Both PPAR -alpha and PPAR -gamma were activated by PFNA in the thymus of mice and rats and in rat spleen (Fang et al., 2008, 2009, 2010). Based on these results, Lin et al. (2011) hypothesize that the increase d levels of the hormone adiponectin associated with human PFNA exposure may be related to activation of PPAR -gamma. In the mouse thymus, PPAR -alpha and PPAR -gamma were activated at only the lowest dose of PFNA, while immunotoxicity was more severe at high er doses. The authors concluded that some immunotoxic effects are independent of both PPAR -alpha and PPAR -gamma and may be due to increased levels of ACTH and cortisol (Fang et al., 2008). Estrogenic activity may also be involved in the mode of action of PFNA and other PFCs. Studies in rainbow trout, a species which has long been used as a model for hu man liver carcinogenesis because it is insensitive to peroxisome proliferation, suggest that PFNA and other PFCs have estrogenic activity and can promote liver tumor develop ment through an estrogenic mechanism (Benninghoff et al., 2011, 2012). Other MOA studies The toxicity of PFNA in rodent spleen and thymus is associated with impairment of cell cycle progression and increased apoptosis in these immune system organs (Fang et al., 2008, 2009, 2010). The proportion of less mature versus mature cells in the thymus was affected by PFNA (Fang et al., 2008). In the spleen, the innate splenic immune cells appeared to be a specific target for PFNA. Potential m odes of action for the immunotoxic effects of PFNA suggested by these studies include increased levels of the hormones ACTH and cortisol, altered levels of cytokines which regulate immune function, and induction of apoptosis via mitochondria -related caspase -independent death signaling pathway. The mode of action for testicular toxicity of PFNA in rats was investigated by Feng et al. (2009; 2010). Histological examination, staining for DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay), and flow cytometry showed that apoptosis in testicular cells was increased in a dose -dependent manner by PFNA (Feng et al., 2009). Two independent pathways are involved with apoptosis in the testes. Data on gene expression and protein levels in the testes suggested that PFNA activates the death receptor pathway, but not the mitochondrial -dependent pathway, for apoptosis. PFNA exposure affects multiple functions of Sertoli cells, testicular cells important for spermatogenesis (Feng et al., 2010). The ult rastructural disruptions observed in vivo may be related to upregulation of the intermediate filament protein vimentin. PFNA affected levels in testes or serum of four proteins secreted by Sertoli cells, and these effects are consistent with in 68 vitro studi es of primary cultured Sertoli cells. Increases in MIS, WT1, and ABP may indirectly reduce free testosterone in testes, consistent with decreased testosterone in PFNA -treated rats observed by Feng et al. (2009). Decreased inhibin B is considered a marker f or testicular toxicity and may indicate impaired secretory function of Sertoli cells and testicular sperm production. Decreases in transferrin and FSH -R caused by PFNA may impair spermatogenesis in the testes. Transferrin delivers iron needed for sperm pr oduction to the germ cells , and FSH -R (the receptor for FSH) regulates many Sertoli cell functions. Fang et al. (2012 b,c) suggest that effects on both Kupffer cells (hepatic macrophages) and hepatocytes contribute to the liver toxicity of PFNA. PFNA a ffected both expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and release of cytokines related to inflammation from Kupffer cells (Fang et al., 2012 c). Exposure to PFNA activates Kupffer cells, leading to release of alpha a nd IL1 of hepatic -alpha in hepatocytes, contribute to the accumulation of lipids in the liver, and increase the toxicity of PFNA to hepatocytes as assessed by serum liver enzyme levels. Consistent with the se effects, inactivation of Kupffer cells by GdCl 3 affected the hepatic effects of PFNA. When Kupffer cells were inactivated, PFNA caused greater expression of PPAR -alpha, smaller increases in hepatic triglycerides, and smaller increases in serum levels of liver enzymes. In vitro studies were consistent with the in vivo studies . Fang et al. ( 2012 a) investigated potential modes of action for increases in serum glucose and hepatic glycogen caused by PFNA in mice. Hepatic levels of four proteins that are part of the insulin signaling pathway were significantly reduced at all doses of PFNA. A decrease in this pathway can induce insulin resistance leading to increased serum glucose. Additionally, hepatic levels of another protein, p -GSK3 -beta, which is responsib le for glycogen synthesis in the liver were increased at all doses, potentially explaining the observed increase in liver glycogen. Because the levels of p -GSK3 -beta are regulated by the insulin signaling pathway, the increased levels of this protein could result from the inhibition of the insulin signaling pathway by PFNA. Oxidative stress may be involved in inhibiting the insulin signaling pathway. Additional modes of action for PFNA and other PFCs have been suggested including oxidative stress, effects on other cell signaling pathways, inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication, and epigenetic changes (reviewed by Lau, 2012). MOA studies in zebrafish Zebrafish are a useful vertebrate model for evaluating the underlying toxicological mode of action of environmental contaminants because of their rapid development and the similarity to higher vertebrates, including humans, of their genetic makeup, developmental processes, anatomy, physiology, and behavior. Studies of PFNA in zebrafish have evaluated effects on the liver, thyroid, development, and behavior . PFNA caused hepatic and thyroid toxicity at relatively low concentrations (0.05 - 0.1 mg/L) with no NOAEL identified , while developmental toxicity and behavioral effects occurred at highe r PFNA concentrations . Zhang et al. (2012a) studied liver toxicity and hepatic protein and gene expression in male zebrafish exposed to PFNA (0. 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/L) for 180 days. Histopathological changes in the liver became more severe as PFNA co ncentration increased and were similar to those 69 observed in rodents exposed to PFNA . Hepatic expression of 57 proteins related to many different function including metabolism of amino acids, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates , pyruvate, glucose, protei ns, and nucleotides; structure and motility ; stress and defense ; signal transduction ; and cell communication were affected at all PFNA concentrations . Results of gene expression studies indicated that the liver toxicity caused by PFNA could not be totally attributed to PPAR -mediated effects. Hepatic effects differed in male versus female zebrafish exposed to PFNA ( 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/L ) for 180 days ( Zhang et al., 2012b). PFNA levels were higher in males than in females exposed to the same concentratio n. In both sexes, body weight and length were decreased in a dose-dependent manner and hepatosomatic index (relative liver weight) was decreased significantly at lower doses, but not the high dose. In liver, total cholesterol was increased in both sexes , but triglycerides were increased in males and decreased in females. Furthermore, the pattern of expression of genes for 11 hepatic fatty acid binding protein in response to PFNA differed greatly between sexes. Expression 10 isoforms was increased in ma les and decreased in females exposed to PFNA, while one isoform showed the opposite pattern. PFNA also affected the expression of genes for proteins involved in regulation of fatty acid binding proteins (PPARs and Ccaat -enhancer binding proteins) differen tly in males and females. Toxicity to the thyroid was reported in a trans -generational study of zebrafish exposed to PFNA (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/L ) for 180 days (Liu et al., 2011 b). In F 0 males exposed for 180 days starting at 23 days post fertil ization, histopathological changes in the thyroid occurred at all PFNA concentrations and became more severe at higher concentrations. Plasma triiodothyronine (T3) was increased in th ose adult fish that were examined (F 0 males, and F 1 males and females) at concentrations as low as 0.05 mg/L. In livers of F 0 males, PFNA induced transthyretin, a protein involved with thyroid hormone transport, and decreased UDP -glucuronosyltransferases, an enzyme involved with thyroid metabolism. Gene expression related to thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism was affected in F 1 larvae from parents exposed to PFNA, but that had developed in a PFNA -free environment, indicating that PFNA caused a transgenerational effect. In a study of the effects of a series of PFCs on ze brafish development, fertilized eggs were exposed to PFNA (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/L) . The developing embryos/larvae were examined before and after hatching until 96 hpf (hours post fertilization) (Zheng et al., 2011). At 72 hpf, the LC50 concentrations for lethality ( opaque embryos ) and the EC 50 for delay of hatching (84 mg/L and 214 mg/L), respectively , were relatively high compared to concentrations of environmental concern. PFNA did not increase the occurrence of edema or malformations. Consistent with the results of this study , PFNA was not reported to cause malformations in rats or mice (Das et al., 2015; Stump et al., 2008). Based on LC 50 values at 72 hpf, the relative potency of PFCs tested in this study was PFOS>PFNA>PFOA. In a se cond study comparing developmental toxicity of a series of PFCs, fertilized zebrafish eggs were exposed to six concentrations of PFNA (0.03 - 10 mg/L) until 144 hpf (Ulhaq et al., 2013a). The LC 50 was greater than 10 mg/L, and there was no effect on heart rate or hatching time within this concentration range. For sublethal effects, including spinal curvature, the EC 50 was 16 mg/L. The relative toxicity of PFNA compare to other PFCs teste d was PFOS>PFDA (C10)>PFNA>PFBS> PFBA, consistent with Zheng et al. ( 2012). 70 An additional study from this research group (Ulhaq et al., 2013b) evaluated effects on locomotor behavior in zebrafish larvae at PFC concentrations below those which caused lethality and/or overt toxicity. Exposure to PFNA at 10 mg/L caused a r eduction in the activity of the zebrafish, while lower concentration ( < 3 mg/L) had no effect. Relative potencies of PFNA and other PFCs Based on comparison with similar studies of PFOA, PFNA (and Surflon S -111 consisting primarily of PFNA) is more pote nt than PFOA for developmental and systemic toxicity (Das et al., 201 5; Mertens et al., 2010; Stump et al., 2008, Wolf et al., 2010). In support of this conclusion, PFNA (1 mg/kg/day) altered the expression of more genes than PFOA (3 mg/kg/day) in both WT and PPAR-alpha KO mice dosed for 7 days ( Rosen et al, 2010). The greater toxicity of PFN A is likely due to both its longer persistence in the body (discussed above) and its greater intrinsic potency (discussed below). In vitro studies of activation of mouse or human PPAR -alpha transfected into cultured cells by a series of PFCs provide information on the relative potency of these compounds for activation of PPAR -alpha. Based on the concentration eliciting 20% of maximal response, PFNA was the most poten t activator of both mouse and human PPAR Wolf et al., 2008). In a follow -up study that included additional PFCs ( Wolf et al., 2012), (C11) and PFDoA (C12) ) were less potent activators of both the hu man and mouse PPAR -alpha receptors than PFNA, with particul arly low activity for activation of the human receptor; these results indicate that potency for this effect in a series of perfluorocarboxylic acid s does not necessarily increase with greater carbon chain length. It should be noted that acti vity in this assay is a measure of intrin sic potency and is independent of differences in half-life or other toxicokinetic parameters. Gene activation profiles of a series of twelve PFCs including PFNA were also studied in primary hepatocytes from humans and mice (Rosen et al., 2013). PFNA was the most active PFC in human cells, based on the average molarity producing a 2-fold change in gene expression, and was a lso among the more active PFCs in mouse cells. However, the study's authors discuss results that indicate that primary hepatoc ytes are proble matic as a model for in vitro effects, since many genes that are well known to be up-regulated by PFCs in vivo were not affected in these in vitro cell assays. PFNA was also more potent than PFOA as a pro moter of liver tu mor develop ment in rainbow trout after initiation with aflatoxin B1 (Benninghoff et al., 2011). The liver tumor incide nce after initiation with AFB w as 13% with no pro moter, 62% after promotion with PFOA (50 mg/kg/day), and 72% after promotion with PFNA (25 mg/kg/day). The percent of hepatic tumors which were adeno mas (as opposed to carcino mas) was 30%, 15%, and 8% in PFOA, and g roups, respectively (Benninghoff et al., 2011). The number of tumors per fish and the mean tumor size were also higher for PFNA than PFOA. In another part of the study, changes in hepatic gene express ion from PFCs were assessed. PFNA altered the expression of most of the same genes affec ted by PFOA and perfluorodecanoic acid (C10), but also altered the expression of a group of other genes not affected by the other two PFCs. In a subsequent study (Benninghoff et al., 2012), PFNA, as well as PFOA and in duced the 71 estrogen -dependent biomarker protein vitellogenin in young rainbow trout, and these PFCs also weakly activated the rainbow trout and human estrogen receptors in vitro. Two additional studies evaluated the effects of PFNA and six other PFCs on in vitro effects on receptors for thyroid hormones, aryl hydrocarbons (AhR), androgens (AR), and estrogens (ER). The PFCs assay, all of the PFCs except PFOA antagonized the effect of the thyroid hormone T3 on the growth of cultured rat pituitary GH3 cells. The potency of PFNA was similar to most of the other PFCs that caused this effect (Kjeldsen and Bonefeld -Jorgensen, 2013). Of the s even PFCs tested, only C10 and C12 activated AhR (Kjeldsen and Bonefeld -Jorgensen, 2013). PFNA did induce transactivity of ER, while PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS did cause this effect (Long et al., 2013). PFNA, as well as PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and C10, antagoni zed the effect of dihydrotestosterone on AR, and a mixture of these five PFCs caused a greater than additive effect on this endpoint (Long et al., 2013). DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTH -BASED MCL Weight of Evidence for Carcinogenicity Health -based MCLs developed b y the DWQI are intended to be protective for ch ronic (lifeti me exposure) through drinking water. The 1984 Amendments to the NJ SDWA stipulate that Health - based MCLs be based on a one in one million lifetime cancer risk level for carcinogens and no adverse effects from lifetime ingestion for non -carcinogens. There is no available information that can be used to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of PFNA because chronic carcinogenicity bioassays have not been conducted. Therefore, the Health -based MCL for PFNA is based on non -carcinogenic effects. Key and Supporting Studies and Endpoints Both the human epidemiology data and the animal toxicology were considered as part of the overall weight of evidence for the potential human health effects of PFNA. While some studies found associations of PFNA with health effects at exposures found in the general population, the extent of the available epidemiology data for PFNA is limited. Causality cannot be proven for the associations that were reported since they prim arily come from cross -sectional studies. Therefore, human data were not used as the basis for the quantitative risk assessment. Because human epidemiology data were not used as the primary basis for risk assessment, a formal weight of evidence evaluation of causality for the human studies was not conducted. The quantitative basis for the Health -based MCL is incre ased liver weight in pregnant mice in a develop mental study conducted by USEPA in which mice were dosed with 0, 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg/day PFNA throughout gestation (Das et al., 201 5). Increased liver weight is a well - established effect of PFNA and other PFCs in experi mental animals. Das et al. (201 5) was selected as the only study appropriate for use as the basis for quantitative risk assess ment becaus e it provi des the numerical serum PFNA data, including statistical parameters, needed for benchmark dose (BMD) modeling. (These numerical data were provided by C. Lau.) PFNA serum levels at the time point when liver weight was measured are also available in a study of 72 male mice exposed to 0, 0.2, 1, or 5 mg/kg/day PFNA for 14 days (Wang et al., 2015). When compared on the basis of PFNA serum levels, the NOAELs and LOAELs for increased liver weight (Table 9) are consistent in male mice (Wang et al., 201 5) and pregnant female mice (Das et al., 201 5), and the dose -response curves for increased relative liver weight are similar in the two studies. Table 9. PFNA serum level NOAELs and LOAELs for increased liver weight in mice NOAEL (ng/ml) LOAEL (ng/ml) Pregnant mice (Das et al., 201 5) ----- 12,400 Male mice (Wang et al., 201 5) ---- 11,500 The only other toxicology studies for which serum PFNA data were reported numerically is the developmental toxicity study in WT and PPAR -alpha KO mice (Wolf et al., 2010). In Wolf et al. (2010), serum PFNA levels were measured 23 days after dosing ended. At this ti me point, a considerable portion of the PFNA would have been excreted, with additi onal loss of PFNA through transfer to breast milk in the lactating dams. Thus, these serum levels are not indicative of the exposure levels which resulted in toxicity and are not suitable for use as the basis for quantitative risk assess ment. In the studies of the Surflon S -111 PFC mixture consisting primarily of PFNA, Mert ens et al. (2010) present serum PFC levels over time in each dosed gr oup in graphs but do not provi de the numerical data that are needed for dose -respo nse modeling. Additionally, the data for the lower serum levels cann ot be accurately estimated from the graphs, due to their scale. Stump et al. (2008) provides only area under the curve graphs for serum levels of the Surflon S -111 mixture, and no serum data is presented for individual PFCs. Nu merical serum PFNA data from these studies have been requested from the sponsors of these studies but have not been provided to date. Of the numerous effects observed in Das et al. (2015), increas ed maternal liver weight was selected as the critical endpoint for quantitative risk assess ment because serum levels and liver weights were both measured at the same time point (GD 17), one day after the last dose. Liver weight increased in a dose related manner with a LOAEL of 1 mg/kg/day , and no NOA EL was identified. Dose -response curves for endpoints of develop mental toxic ity assessed in the offspr ing in Das et al. (2015) are similar as for maternal liver weight. These endpoints were not used as the basis for quantitative dose response modeling of maternal serum levels because of greater uncertainty about the relationship o f maternal serum levels on GD 17 to those effects that were assessed in offspring at later time-points. Serum levels of PFNA measured in the offspring were not used in dose-response modeling of the delays in offspring develop mental endp oints because they were measured after maternal dosing 73 ended and/or at different time points than when endpoints were assessed in the offspring . Thus, these serum levels in the offspring may not be indicative of the serum levels which caused the observed effects. It is notab le that decreased body weights in male offspring persist ed until at least 287 days of age, a time point at which almost all PFNA had been eliminated from the body. PFNA caused similar effects at similar or low er doses in a study in male mice (Wang et al., 2015) and in a second develop mental study in another strain of mice (Wolf et al., 2010). PFNA also caused several other types of toxicity in other studies at similar or lower doses and/or estimated serum levels than those (>1 mg/kg/day) causing increased maternal liver weight in Das et al. (2015). These studies are discussed in detail above, and include increased liver weight at 0.45 mg/kg/day in mice dosed for 21 days (Kennedy, 1987); increased serum glucose and other effects at 1 mg/kg/day, and related bioche mical effects at 0.2 mg/kg/day, in mice dosed for 14 days (Fang et al., 2012a); immunotoxicity at 1 mg/kg/day in mice dosed f or 14 days (Fang et al., 2008); and damage to testicular Sertoli cells and other related effects at 1 mg/kg/day in rats dosed for 14 days. Additionally Stump et al. (2008) and Mertens et al. (2010) discuss an unpublished study (Wolterbeek, 2004) in which serum cholesterol, calcium, and phospholipids were decreased in male mice dosed with 0.1 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111, a PFC mixture containing primarily PFNA, for 14 days. Histopath ological effects in the liver, including necrosis, occurred in male mice dosed with Surflon S -111 at 0.025 mg/kg/day for 18 or 21 weeks, a dose at which hepatic enlarge ment did not occur (Stump et al. 2010). The results of these other studies, as well as the other effects in Das et al. (2015), provide further quali tative support to the dose and serum level chosen as the basis for quantitative risk assess ment. Determination of Point of Departure (POD) Benc hmark dose (BMD) modeling is a quantitative approach commonly used to estimate a generalizable NOAEL that does n ot directly depend on the specific doses/exposures in a given study. In this context, it is used to predi ct the dose (BMD) and its lower 95% con fidence limit (BMDL) corresponding to a minimal response level (the BMR) that is consistent with the observed data. USEPA Bench mark Dose Mod eling Software 2.6.0.86 (USEPA, 201 5b) was used to perform BMD modeling of the data on liver weight on GD 17 in pregnant mice exposed to PFNA on GD 1 -17 (Das et al., 2015). The data used to generate the graphs presented in Das et al. (2015) were provided in numerical form from the investigators . Average serum levels in the pregnant mice on GD 17 in the 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg/day groups were 13 ng/ml, 12,400 ng/ ml, 18,300 ng/ml, and 57,100 ng/ml, respectively. Average liver weights in the 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg/day groups on GD 17 were 2.24, 3.29, 4.36, and 5.26 g. The number of pregnant mice in the 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg/da y groups was 8, 8, 8, and 10, respectively. BMD and the BMDL serum levels were deter mined for a 10% increase from the mean liver weight in the pregnant control mice using EPA BMD software (version 2. 6.0.86 ).All models for continuous data included in th e software were run . Results of the BMD modeling are shown in Table 10, and the complete output of the BMDS software for each model is presented in Appendix 4. The Hill model and the Exponential model 5 gave almost identical AIC statistics, and these 74 were the lowest AIC values of the models run. Both of these models also show an excellent visual fit to the data. As there is no basis to choose between two models which have equally good statistics and fit, the average of the BMDLs from these two models was used as the Point of Departure. The BMDLs for the Exponential mode l 5 and the Hill model are 4.43 \u00b5g/ml and 5.43 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. The average of these values is 4. 93 \u00b5g/ml which rounds to 4.9 \u00b5g/L (4900 ng/L) . Because half-life of serum is 34-69 days, the serum concentration of PFNA following the 17 days of dosing represents the maximum serum concentration during the dosing period, and the average exposure over this period was lower than the exposure at the end of the dosi ng period. Thus, attributing the liver weight effect to the serum concentration on day 17 is a non-conservative approach as the effect could have resulted from the lower average exposure s experienced over the whole time period of dosing.

Derivation of health -based water concentration Application of uncertainty factors The choice of uncertainty factors is consistent with current USEPA IRIS guidance (USEPA, 2012c) and previous risk assessments developed by NJDEP and the DWQI. 75 Uncertainty factors (UFs) are applied to the POD serum level of 4.9 ug/ml (4900 ng/ml) derived above to obtain the target human serum level. The target human serum level (ng/ml serum) is analogous to a Reference Dose (RfD) but is expressed in terms of inter nal, rather than administered, dose. The total uncertainty factor applied to the POD serum level is 1000, and includes the following uncertainty factor s: 10 - Human variation, to account for variation in susceptibility across the human population and the possibility that the available data may not be representative of individuals who are most sensitive to the effect. 3 - Animal -to-human extrapolation, to account for toxicodyna mic differences between humans and mice. The typical uncertai nty factor of 3 for toxicokinetic variability between species is not included because the risk assess ment is based on co mparison of internal dose (serum levels) rather than ad ministered dose. 10 - Duration of exposure The POD is based on a syste mic effect (incr eased liver weight) resulting from exposure for only 17 days, while the value derived is intended to protect for chronic exposure. Other studies discussed above suggest that PFNA causes additional and/or more severe effects as exposure duration increases. 3 - Incom plete database Gaps in the toxicology database for P FNA include the lack of develop mental neurobehavioral studies, the absence of chronic/carcinogenicity studies, and lack of two -generation study in an appropriate species, as well as the lack of studies of specific developmental effects such as mammary gland development that are affected by low doses of the closely related compound, PFOA. Additionally, the results of Stump et al. (2008) suggest that PFNA causes liver necrosis at doses below those that cause increased liver weight, the endpoint used as the basis for the risk assessment. The target human serum level is: 4,900 ng/ml = 4.9 ng/ml. 1000 Relative Source Contribution factor A Relati ve Source Contribution (RSC) factor that accounts for non -drinking water sources including food, soil, air, water, and consumer products is used in the development of health - based drinking water concentrations based on non -carcinogenic effects. This approa ch is used by the DWQI for Health -based MCLs, by USEPA for Maximum Contaminant Level Goals, and by other states in development of similar health -based drinking water values. An RSC is intended to prevent total exposure from all sources from exceeding RfD ( USEPA, 2000). When sufficient chemical -specific information on non -drinking water exposures are not available, a default RSC of 0.2 is used, meaning that 20% of the RfD may come from drinking water (USEPA, 2000). When sufficient chemical -specific exposure data are available, a less stringent chemical -specific RSC may be derived, with floor -ceiling values of 20% -80% (USEPA, 2000). 76 In the most recent NHANES data from 2011 -12, the geometric mean serum PFNA concentration was 0.88 ng/ml and the 95th value was 2.54 ng/ml (CDC, 2015). PFNA serum levels in NHANES reflect background exposures to PFNA and PFNA precursors at levels prevalent throughout the U.S. from media such as food, water, air, dust, and consumer products. Based on the infrequent occu rrence of PFNA reported in U.S. public drinking water supplies in UCMR3 and other studies (discussed above), it is unlikely that the mean and median PFNA serum levels in the U.S. general population reported by NHANES are influenced by drinking water exposu res. Non-drinking water exposures in N.J. may reflect multiple overlapping sources of release of PFNA including those background exposures that are influenced by air transport within N.J., and this may be particularly true in communities where drinking w ater has been impacted by past industrial use and discharge of PFNA. In contrast, mean national estimates of exposure, as indicated by the mean serum levels identified in NHANES, reflect exposures in large parts of the U.S. where there are few or no sourc es of PFNA manufacture or use. Because PFNA is known to bioaccumulate in fish, the possibility of elevated exposures from recreationally caught fish is of particular concern in areas with past industrial release of PFNA. In 2004 -2007, elevated levels of P FNA, as well as C11, were found in fillets from white perch and channel catfish from locations on the Delaware River in the vicinity of communities where drinking water is contaminated with PFNA (DRBC, 2009). However information provided by the Delaware R iver Basin shows that PFNA was not detected in fillets from these two species from the same Delaware River locations in more recent sampling in 2010 and 2012. Because the most recent data do not suggest elevated exposures from recreationally caught fi sh in communities where PFNA is present in drinking water, the 95th percentile PFNA serum level of 2.54 ng/mL ( Table 2 ), which rounds to 2.5 ng/ml, is assumed to represent a reasonable and protective estimate of total non -drinking water exposure. It was therefore considered appropriate to use this 95th percentile serum value to develop a chemical -specific RSC for PFNA. The RSC for PFNA is developed using the \"subtraction\" approach described by USEPA (2000), but on the basis of serum levels rather than admi nistered dose. The chemical specific RSC (%) for PFNA is developed by subtracting the NHANES (2011 -12) 95th percentile PFNA serum level from the target human serum level for PFNA (above) of 4.9 ng/L, and dividing by the target human serum level. RSC = Target human serum level - 95th % NHANES serum level x 100 Target human serum level PFNA RSC = 4.9 ng/ml - 2.5 ng/ ml x 100 = 49.0% (rounded to 50%) 4.9 ng/ml Based on the above, the increase in hu man serum level th at can result from drinking water exposure only is: 4.9 ng/ml x 0. 5 = 2.45 ng/ml which rounds to 2.5 ng/ml (2500 ng/L) . 77 Development of Health -based MCL Development of the Health -based MCL for PFNA is based on the same general approach used to develo p the New Jersey health -based drinking water guidance for PFOA. This approach is described in NJDEP (2007) and Post et al. (2009a) and is applicable to other persistent PFCs found in drinking water. Because the half-life of long -chain PFCs such as PFNA is much longer in humans (several years) than in rats and mice, a given administered dose ( mg/kg/day) results in a much greater internal dose (as indicated by serum level) in humans than in these animal species. Therefore, comparisons between effect levels in ani mal studies and human exposures were made on the basis of serum levels rather than ad ministered dose. As discussed above, ongoing exposure to PFOA in drinking water increases PFOA serum levels, on average, in a serum:drinking water ratio of at least 100:1 with several studies indicating mean ratios substantially above 100:1. The 100:1 ratio for PFOA u sed in develop ment of the PFOA drinking water guidance is based on data from adults and is higher in infants and young children. The half-life of PFNA is estimated as 2 to 30 times long er than that of PFOA in rats and mice, and limited human data indicate that its human half-life is at least twice as long as for PFOA (with the exception of the more uncertain data from women of childbearing age; Tables 3 and 4). These data on the relative half-lives of PFOA and PFNA indicate that use of a ratio of 200:1 is not overly stringent . Although upper percentile values for exposure parameters are typically used by USEPA and DWQI for drinking water risk assessment, the 200:1 ratio is intended to represent a central tendency estimate rather than an upper percentile value . Based on the 200:1 ratio between PFNA serum levels and drinking water concentration derived above, an increase in PFNA serum level of 2500 ng/L is expected to result from ongoing exposure to 12.5 ng/L, which rounds to 13 ng/L , PFNA in drinking water . Therefore, the Health -based MCL for PFNA is calculated as 13 ng/L or 0.0 13 \u00b5g/L . DISCUSSION OF UNCERTAINTIES Ongoing exposure to PFNA at 13 ng/L (0 .013 \u00b5g/L) in drinking water is estimated to contribute an a dditional 2.6 ng/ml, on average , to the PFNA concentration in blood serum already present in the general population based on a serum:drinking water ratio of 200:1 . Thus, the average serum level in communities with drinking water at 13 ng/L ( 0.013 \u00b5g/L ) is estimated at about 3.5 ng/ml, by adding the contribution to serum from drinking water (2.6 ng/ml) to the geometric me an (0.88 ng/ ml, which rounds to 0.9 ng/L ) serum level in the general U.S. popul ation. This represents a n increase of about 3-fold from the general population geometric me an. In infants and young children, the increase in serum levels from ongoing exposure to PFNA in drinking water would likely be greater than in adults, due to their greater water consumption on a body weight basis. Although the epidemiological data on PFNA are limited, several epidemiological studies have found associations of PFNA serum levels in the general population with potentially important health endpoints . Causality cannot be established for these effects because of the 78 cross -sectional design of the studies and because, in some studies, the associations cannot be definitively attributed to PFNA because of correlations with other PFCs. However, these data contribute to the overall body of evidence about the potential hazard of PFNA. Thus, there is uncertainty about the extent of protection provided by a Health -based MCL that will result in serum PFNA levels above the general population range. No scientific studies have been conducted in c ommunities with elevated exposures to PFNA from drinking water or other enviro nmental media. The sole study of workers with occupat ional exposure is of limited utility, in part because PFNA serum levels were not reported. Several important health endpoints that have been linked to the closely related compound, PFOA , in studies of populations with drinking water exposure, including cancer, have not been evaluated in humans exposed to PFNA. An unpublished 14 day study of Surf lon S -111 (Wolterbeek, 2004; cited in Mertens et al., 2010, and Stump et al., 2008) found decreased serum cholesterol, phospholipids, and calcium in male rats at 0.1 mg/kg/day. Cholesterol and calcium were not affected at higher doses of Surflon S -111 in the 90 day rat subchronic study and phospholipids were not measured. These unpublished results raise uncertainties about the potential for Surflon S - 111 and PFNA to cause these effects in rats, as well as uncertainty about other effects in the unpublished study that may not have been discussed by Stump et al. (2008) and Mertens et al. (2010). Histopathological changes in the liver, including necrosis, occurred in F 0 and F 1 males in the two-generation rat study (Stump et al., 2008) at a dose (Surflon S -111, 0.025 mg/kg/day; PFNA, 0.019 mg/kg/day) below the doses that caused increased liver weight in the same study. Thus, histopathological changes, including necrosis, were a more sensitive endpoint than increased liver weight in this rat study. No NOAEL was identified for these histopathological effects in liver in the two -generation rat study, and the LOAEL in male rats was 0.025 mg/kg/day Surflon S -111 (0.019 mg/kg/day PFNA). It is important to note that the histopathological changes in the liver reported by Stump et al. (2008), and Mertens et al. (2010) are not of the same nature as are those typically associated with PPAR -alpha activation (peroxisome proliferation and increased smooth endoplasmic reticulum), suggesting that PFNA causes liver toxicity ind ependent of PPAR -alpha mediated effects. In part because numerical serum level data are not available, this study and endpoint cannot be used for quantitative risk assess ment. Available graphical infor mation from this study and the accompanying study (Mer tens et al., 2010) s uggests t hat the serum PFNA level in males at 0.025 mg/kg/day was well below the serum PFNA level at the lowest dose (1 mg/kg/day) in the Das et al. (2015) mouse develop mental study used as the basis for quantitative risk assess ment. However, histopathological changes in the maternal and pup liver were not evaluated by Das et al. (201 5), and it is not known if these effects occurred in this study. Quantitative risk assessment based on liver histopathology could result in a significantly lower BMDL than the one based on Das et al. (201 5). 79 No chronic toxicology studies of cancer or other effects that may occur after longer exposures and/or in old age have been conducted. PFOA and PFOS, the only two PFCs for which chronic studies have been conducted, caused tumors in rats. Results of the subchronic (Mertens et al., 2010) and the two -generation (Stump et al., 2008) suggest that additional and/or more severe effects may occur as exposure duration increases. It is not known whether PFNA cause s some effects seen in mice exposed to low doses of PFOA and/or other PFCs. PFOA causes specific developmental effects in mice at low doses (0.01 mg/kg/day) and serum levels, including delayed mammary gland development (reviewed in Post et al., 2012; Tucke r et al., 2014). The serum level BMDLs for PFOA based on delayed mammary gland development endpoints in mice are 23 -25 ng/ml (Post et al., 2012), more than two orders of magnitude lower than the BMDL for PFNA of 5300 ng/L based on maternal liver weight gai n. Additionally, neonatal mice exposed to a single dose of <1 mg/kg of other persistent PFCs (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS) exhibited permanent neurobehavioral effects accompanied by changes in critical brain proteins. These endpoints have not been evaluated for PFNA , which is closely related to PFOA and has a generally similar profile of toxicological effects. The subchronic (Mertens et al., 2010) and two -generation (Stump et al., 2008) rat studies used a mixture of PFCs with PFNA as the primary component. These are the only toxicology studies of PFNA with exposure durations greater than 21 days. As discussed above, the data suggest that PFNA was pri marily responsible for the effects observed in these studies. Nonetheless, there is uncertainty about the contribut ion of the other PFCs that are minor components of the mixture to the effects that were observed. There is uncertainty about the serum:drinking water ratio of 200:1 for PFNA. Although this ratio is reasonable and not overly stringent based on the available toxicokinetic data from animals and humans, human information on the half -life of PFNA is limited, and scientific studies of serum levels in communities exposed to PFNA in drinking water are not available . Although upper percentile exposure assumptions are typically used in risk assessment, these values are intended to represent central tendency estimates, rather than upper percentile values. Uncertainties about the human relevance of effects seen in animals are inherent to all risk assessments based on an imal data. The available information indicates that the effects of PFNA observed in experimental animals can be assumed to be relevant to humans for the purposes of risk assessment. Available information indicates that the target organs and modes of actio n are generally similar for PFNA and other PFCs, particularly PFOA. Therefore, the toxicity of PFNA and other PFCs may be additive. Although PFNA and other PFCs, including PFOA, are known to co-occur in some NJ public water supplies, the potential for addi tive toxicity of PFNA and other PFCs was not considered in development of the Health -based MCL. 80 HEALTH -BASED MCL RECOMMENDATION The recommended Health -based MCL for PFNA is 13 ng/L or 0.013 \u00b5g/L.81 B.

Individual Study Tables for Epidemiologic Study of Human Health Effects and PFNA Reference and Study Design Exposure Measures Results Comment Bloom et al., 2010 Study Design: Cross -sectional Location: New York, United States Population: Subgroup of 31 of 38 participants from Licensed New York State sportfish anglers and their pa rtners (NYSACS) [n=18,082] who completed a Dioxin Exposure Substudy component, age 31 to 45 years. Outcome Definition: Questionnaire and a blood sample Exposure Assessment: Serum concentrations -Level confounders considered included age, gender, BMI, smoking, goiter or thyroid condition, race/ethnicity, use of thyroid medication, and self-reported consumption of sportfish caugh t from NY waters PFCs Cross -sectional design prevents causal inference. Small sample size limited ability to control for potential covariates and confound ers simultaneously, or other potential environmental compounds of interest or other PFCs. 102 Reference and Study Design Exposure Measures Results Comment Braun et al., 2014 Study Design: Prospective birth cohort Location: Cincinnati, OH Population: Pregnant women in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME). Final study size included 175 mother -child pairs. Outcome Definition: Autistic behaviors measured as mother complet ed Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) at 4 and 5 years of age of child. Higher scores indicate more autistic behaviors. Exposure Assessment: Maternal serum @ 16 -26 weeks of pregnancy Population -Level Exposure: PFNA median is 0.9 ng/m l. Stat Method: Bayes ian models were used and covariates and confounders considered include: maternal age at delivery, race, marital status, education, parity, insurance status, employment, and household income, and prenatal vitamin use, depressive symptoms during the second trimester, maternal full -scale IQ. Also used to two-stage Bayesian models to control for co - pollutants. Exposures were log -transformed Outcome: SRS total scores Major Findings: Negligible changes in SRS scores *note PFOA - found a protective association Major Limitations: Modest sample size may have resulted in failure to detect associations. Possible confounding due to unmeasured variables and other environmental contaminants, including other PFCs. 103 Reference and Study Design Exposure Measures Results Comment Buck Louis et al., 2014 Study Design: Cross -sectional Location: Population from 16 counties in Michigan and Texas Population: 501 males partners of couples planning pregnancy Outcome Defi nition: 35 semen quality endpoints using baseline serum sample and follow -up one month later (used for sensitivity analysis) Exposure Assessment: Serum concentrations Population -Level Exposure: Median (IQR): Michigan=1.0 (0.75, Texas=1.65 (1.2, 2. 2) Stat Method: Linear regression, covariates and confounders assessed include age, BMI, smoking, abstinence time, sample age (hours), and study site PFCs were natural log transformed Outcome: Volume, straw distance, sperm concentration, total count , hypo -osmotic swollen, 8 motility measures, 6 sperm head measures, 12 individual and 2 summary morphology measures, 2 sperm chromatin stability measures Major Findings: Only 'Morphology - Strict Criteria (%)' was statistically associated with PFNA [=3.8 97 (95% CI 0.564, 7.231)]. The other 34 parameters were not statistically significant associated with PFNA. Comment: PFNA serum concentrations are relatively different between mean from Michigan and Texas (possibly explainable by the different recruitmen t techniques in each state). Importantly analyses were not stratified by recruitment location other exposure ranges differed. Major Limitations: Lack of well -established norms for many individual parameters and a reliance on next day semen analysis and p ossible spurious associations. Absence of any reproductive hormone measurements. Possible confounding due to unmeasured variables. Cross -sectional design prevents causal inference. 104 Reference and Study Design Exposure Measures Results Com ment Chen et al., 2012 Study Design: Prospective birth cohort Location: Taiwan Population: Study subjects from the Taiwan Birth Panel Study (TBPS), 2004 -2005.

Covariates and confounders considered include sexual abstinence period, age, BMI, caffeinated drinks, cotinine, fever during past 3 months, self-reported genital infections, and testicular disorders, and spillage of semen sample. All analyses were stratified by region Outcome: DNA damage in sperm Major Findings: Estimates for associations with PFNA not provided in paper: An association of PFNA with sperm DNA fragmentation was not found in any of the three regions in uncorrected analyses, and similar results were obtained after adjustment for potential confounders.\" PFNA was not associated with T UNEL - positivity No other associations between PFNA and apoptotic markers were consistent across regions or in models within regions. PFNA were not consistently related to SHBG concentrations and associations were not consistent across region for testoster one, estradiol, and gonadotropins . Major Limitations: Serum levels of the individuals PFCs were highly and significantly correlated. Cross -sectional design prevents causal inference. Varying participation rates. Blood samples were collected approximat ely a year before the semen samples. Long half -lives make it unlikely that a skewed sampling is unlikely. 135 Reference and Study Design Exposure Measures Results Comment Starling et al., 2014a Study Design: Nested case -control Location: Norway Population: Nulliparous pregnant women (466 cases of preeclampsia, 510 non-cases) selected from a prospective pregnancy cohort (MoBa), 16 -44 years.

Premenopausal women were censored at the time of their survey. Side note: Also look at both the association of PFC and hysterectomy and whether rate of natural menopause predicts serum concentrations to assess reverse causality. HR calculated with increasing tertiles of PFNA. Outcome: Menopause Major between PFNA and the rate of hysterectomy, and PFNA increased with time since natural menopause. Major Limitations: PFC measures based on a single measurement. Correlations with other PFCs makes it difficult to tease out the impact of PFNA independently. Reverse causality may explain association of PFNA and earlier age at menopause.

Mice allowed to give birth and sacrificed on PND 28 : GD 1 -17 Severe maternal toxicity at 10 mg/kg/day Substantial weight loss sta rting at GD 8. All mice in this dose group were sacrificed on GD 13, and all pregnant mice had full litter resorptions. PFNA concentration in serum and liver Data presented graphically. Liver and serum PFNA with dose in: -GD 17 pregnant and non -pregnant adult females -GD 17 fetuses (livers only, serum not analyzed) -Dams at post -weaning on PND 28 followed from PND 1 to PND 70. Serum PFNA (numerical data obtain ed from investigator, C. Lau) On GD 17, serum PFNA generally ~2x higher in non -pregnant than in pregnant adult female mice. Lower PFNA serum levels in pregnant mice are presumed to be due to transfer to the fetal compartment. In pups, similar in males and females from PND 1 to PND 70. In pups soon after birth (PND 1), similar to maternal serum levels on GD 17. In pups, serum PFNA at PND 70 to about 4 -7% of PND 1 levels. In pups, s erum PFNA persisted at low levels at 43 weeks (10 months), the last time point assessed. In males, levels were about 1% of those at PND 1, and in females, about 0.2 -0.4% of PND 1 (Numerical data provi ded by C. Lau.) Liver PFNA In pregnant, non -pregnant, and post -weaning (PND 28) female adults, PFNA in liver was about 5 -10 times higher than serum PFN levels in the same dose groups. Liver levels generally paralleled serum levels. PFNA levels In fet al livers on GD 17 were similar to maternal PFNA serum levels at the same time point. In the livers of pups, PFNA levels declined more slowly than serum levels over time. PFNA in liver was about 3 -fold higher than PFNA serum levels at PND 1. At PND 7 0, PFNA liver PFNA concentrations were about 12 -18% of PND 1 levels . In pups, PFNA persisted at low levels in liver until 43 weeks (10 months), the last time point assessed. In male offspring at age 10 months, PFNA in liver was about 2 -4% of PND 1 le vels, and in females, about 0.1 -0.3% of PND 1 levels (Numerical data obtained from C. Lau). Serum PFNA levels were measured in adults on GD 17 and PND 28, and in offspring on days 1, 10, 24, 42, and 70. Histopathological examination was not performed on liver or other organs. Mice that had no live or dead fetuses at sacrifice on GD 17 were considered to be non - pregnant Gene expression in fetal and pup liver Real time PCR analysis was used to study the expression of genes of interest in livers from fetuses (GD 17) and pups on PND 1, 24, 42, and 70. PFNA clearly caused expression of genes associated with PPAR -alpha activation in fetal and pup liver. Gene changes associated with PPAR - alpha persisted until PND 42, although the effects were weaker after PND 24. 148 Reference and Study Design Results Comment Das et al. (201 5) (continued ).

(p<0.05; data shown only for males). Serum levels of PFNA were not measured in this study. Although this study indicates the potential for PFNA to cause immune toxicity, the dose used was high enough to cause overt toxicity, as demonstrated by the severe weight loss seen in treated animals. Also, the route of administration, i.p. injection, is not relevant to human exposure. 163 Reference and Study Design Results Comment Rogers et al. (2014).

Some numerical data estimated from graph. ALT and AST: (p<0.01) 4 -8 fold at 5 mg/kg/day. Serum PFNA levels were measured at the end of the dosing period, the same time point at which the toxicological endpoints were assessed. Other components of this study evaluated the effects of PFNA on expression of genes and proteins related to PPAR -alpha (which increases fatty acid oxidation/lipolysis, and decrease serum lipids) and sterol regulatory element -binding proteins which are related to lipid biosynthesis. Although PPAR -alpha was activated, SREBP genes involved with lipid synthesis were even more strongly activated, at doses below the highest dose. The authors conclude that PFNA upregulates PPAR - alpha -mediated lipid breakdown, but also upregulates SREBP medi ated lipid biosynthesis, and that the effects on serum and hepatic lipids represent a balance between these effects. The increased hepatic lipids at the lower doses may occur because the lipid synthesis effect predominates over the PPAR -alpha mediated lipid breakdown effect at the lower doses, while the PPAR -alpha stimulation of lipolysis is more dominant at the highest dose. 168 Reference and Study Design Results Comment Wolf et al.

Tests of Interest Test -2*log(Likelihood Ratio) Test df p -value 191 Test 1 77.7842 6 <.0001 Test 2 8.04159 3 0.04516 Test 3 2 0.3892 Test 4 7.6566 1 0.005656 The p-value for Test 1 is less than .05. There appears to be a difference between response and/or variances among the dose levels It seems appropriate to model the data The p-value for Test 2 is less than .1. A non -homogeneous variance model appears to be appropriate The p-value for Test 3 is greater than .1. The modeled variance appears to be appropriate here The p-value for Test 4 is less than .1. You may want to try a different model Benchmark Dose Computation Specified effect = 0.1 Risk Type = Relative deviation Confidence level = 0.95 BMD = 1.76206 BMDL = 1.39649 BMDL computation failed for one or more point on the BMDL curve.
