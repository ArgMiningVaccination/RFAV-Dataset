A case can be considered epidemiologically linked to a laboratory -confirmed case if at least one case in the chain of transmission is laboratory confirmed. Laboratory -confirmed case: A case that is confirmed by one or more of the laboratory methods listed in the case definition under Laboratory Confirmation Tests . While other laboratory methods can be used in clinical diagnosis, only those listed are accepted as laboratory confirmation for national and state reporting purposes. Probable case: A case that is classified as probable for reporting purposes Supportive or presumptive laboratory results: Specified laboratory results that are consistent with the diagnosis, yet do not meet the criteria for laboratory confirmation Suspect case: A case that is classifie d as suspect for reporting purposes Normally sterile sit e: Invasive diseases typically cause significant morbidity and mortality. Sterile sites include: Blood (excluding cord blood) Bone or bone marrow Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Pericardial fluid Peritoneal fluid Pleural fluid These are also considered sterile sites when certain other criteria are met: o Internal body sites (brain, heart, liver, spleen, vitreous fluid, kidney, pancreas, lymph node or ovary) when the specimen is collected aseptically during a surgical procedure o Joint fluid when the joint surface is intact (no abscess or significant break in the skin) Placentas and amniotic fluid from an intact amnion are not sterile sites, but Group B streptococci or Listeria isolation from these site s may qualify as invasive disease. Consult the Sterile Site and Invasive Disease Determination flowchart in Appendix A of the EAIDB Investigation Guidelines: https://www.dshs.texas.gov/IDCU/investigation/Investigation -Guidance/ Normally sterile sites do not include : Anatomical body areas that normally harbor either resident or transient flora (bacteria) including mucous membranes (e.g., throat, vagina), sputum, and skin; abscesses; or localized soft tissue infection v ABBREVIATIONS LABORATORY TEST ABBREVIATIONS CF - Complement fixation CIDT - Culture -independent diagnostic testing CLSI - Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute CSF - Cerebrospinal fluid DFA - Direct fluorescent antibody DNA - Deoxyribonucleic acid EEG - Electroencephalogram Enzyme - Immunodiffusion IFA - Indirect fluorescent antibody test IgG - Immunoglobulin G IgM - Immunoglobulin M IHA - Indirect hemagglutination IHC - Immunohistochemistry LA - Latex agglutination MA -- Microagglutination MIC - Minimum inhibitory concentration MRI - Magnetic resonance imaging NAT - Nucleic acid testing PCR - Polymerase chain reaction PRNT - Plaque reduction neutralization test RIBA - Recombinant immunoblot RIPA transcriptase -polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-QuIC - Real-time quaking -induced conversion WB - Western blot HEPATITIS TEST MARKERS Hepatitis A - HAV Anti-HAV - hepatitis A antibody Anti-HAV IgM - hepatitis A IgM antibody Hepatitis B - HBV HBcAb or anti -HBc - hepatitis B core antibody HBc IgM or anti -HBc IgM - hepatitis B core IgM antibody HBeAb or anti -HBe - hepatitis B e antibody HBeAg - hepatitis B e antigen HBsAb or anti -HBs - hepatitis B surface antibody HBsAg - hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C - HCV Anti HCV - hepatitis C antibody HCV RNA - hepatitis C nucleic acid HCV NAT - hepatitis C nucleic acid testing HCV RIBA - hepatitis C recombinant immunoblot assay Hepatitis D - HDV Anti-HDV - hepatitis D antibody Hepatitis E - HEV Anti-HEV IgM - hepatitis E IgM antibody OTHER ABBREVIATIONS ALT - Alanine transaminase ARDS - Acute Respiratory Distress S yndrome AST - Aspartate transaminase CDC - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention DSHS - Department of State Health Services EAIDU - Emerging and Acute Infectious Disease Unit FDA - Food and Drug Administration HAI- Healthcare Associated Infections ILI - Influenza -Like Illness NDM-1 - New Delhi Metallo -beta-lactamase -1 NPDPSC - The National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center TAC - Texas Administrative Code VHF - Viral hemorrhagic fever vi NOTES Rickettsia Classification Rickettsial diseases can be difficult to distinguish between because of overlapping symptomatology and cross -reactivity in serology, which comprises the majority of diagnostic testing for these diseases. The Rickettsia are divided into two antigenic groups for surveillance purposes: spotted fever group and typhus group. The condition spotted fever rickettsiosis is defined as infectio n with spotted fever group Rickettsia spread by tick vectors. Flea -borne (murine) typhus, caused primarily by R. typhi and spr ead by fleas, and epidemic typhus, caused by R. prowazekii and transmitted by lice, belong to the typhus group. A table classifying Rickettsial species known to cause disease in humans by antigenic group, disease, primary vector, and reservoir occurrence c an be found in the CDC's Traveler's Health Yellow Book m-positive organisms that often occur as chains or pairs. There are four different classification systems for Streptococcus species, c linical (pyogenic, Lancefield group Streptococci are subdivided into groups by antibodies that recognize surface antigens. The serologic reactivity of \"cell wall \" polysaccharide Rebecca Lancefield. Twenty group -specific antigens were established, Lancefield A - H and K -U. Clinically significant Lancefield groups include A, B, C, F, and G. Some streptococci such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and the viridans streptococci group nontypeable. Hemolytic reaction The type of hemolytic reaction displayed on b lood agar has also been used to classify the streptococci. Beta-hemolysis is associated with complete lysis of red cells surrounding the colony, whereas alpha-hemolysis is a partial or \"green\" hemolysis associated with reduction of red cell hemoglobin. Non hemolytic colonies have been termed gamma -hemolytic. The property of hemolysis is not very reliable for the absolute identification of streptococci, but it is widely used in rapi d screens for identification . Reportable Streptococcus Streptococcus pneumoniae - Most strains -hemolytic but can cause \u00df -hemolysis during anaerobic incubation. They are nontypeable by Lancefield group.

Amebic meningitis / encephalitis, other 10096 or encephalitis. Granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE) can include general symptoms and signs of encephalitis such as early personality and behavioral changes, depressed mental status, fever, photophobia, seizures, nonspecific cranial nerve dysfunction, and visual loss. GAE neurologic infections are generally fatal within weeks or months; however, a few patients have survived. Confirmed: A clinically compatible case that i s laboratory confirmed Note: Acanthamoeba species and Balamuthia mandrillaris can also cause disseminated disease (affecting multiple organ systems) or cutaneous disease. For B. mandrillaris disease, painless skin lesions appearing as plaques a few millimeters thick and one to several centimeters wide have been observed in some patients, especiall y patients outside the U.S., preceding the onset of neurologic symptoms by 1 month to approximately 2 years. Skin lesions and sinus disease may be seen in Acanthamoeba disease. Disseminated disease and cutaneous disease caused by free-living amebae are onl y voluntarily reportable in Texas unless they progress to meningitis or encephalitis.

DSHS can assist in coordinating specimen and/or electronic images submission to the CDC for verification. Collection & shipping procedures can be found mandrillaris can cause clinically similar illnesses and might be difficult to differentiate using commonly available laboratory procedures. Definitive diagnosis by a reference laboratory might be required. A negative test on CSF does not rule out Acanthamoeba or Balam uthia infection because these organisms are not commonly present in the CSF. Amebic meningoencephalitis, primary (PAM) An infection presenting as meningoencephalitis or encephalitis. The clinical presentation of PAM is like that of acute meningitis caused by other pathogens and symptoms include headache, Detection of Naegleria fowleri from a clinical specimen via: 4 80750 nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fever, lethargy, and stiff neck. Disorien tation, mental status changes, seizure activity, loss of consciousness, and ataxia may occur within hours of initial presentation. After the onset of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually results in death within 3 to 7 days. Confirmed : A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed Probable : A clinically compatible case that meets at least one of the supportive laboratory criteria (listed below) and does not meet confirmatory lab criteria Supportive laboratory evidence: o Visualization of motile amebae in a wet mount of CSF o Isolation of N. fowleri in culture from a clinical specimen See also Amebic meningitis/encephalitis, other Detection of nucleic acid (e.g., PCR), OR Detection of antigen (e.g., immunohistochemistry) Notes: When available, molecular characterization [e.g., genotype] should be reported.

Fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy can accompany the lesion. Inhalation: A prodrome resembling a viral respiratory illness , followed by hypoxia and dyspnea, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with resulting cyanosis and shock. Radiographic evidence of mediastinal widening or pleural effusion is common. Ingestion presents as two sub -types: Gastrointestinal: Severe abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, bloody diarrhea, anorexia, fever, and septicemia. Oropharyngeal: Mucosal lesion in the oral cavity or oropharynx, with adenopathy, edema, pharyngitis, fever, a nd possible septicemia. Injection: Severe soft tissue infection manifested as significant edema or bruising after injection. No eschar is apparent and pain is not common. Nonspecific symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and nausea are sometimes the first indication of illness. Systemic involvement: May include fever, convulsions, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, leukocytosis, and/or meningeal signs (anthrax meningitis). These complications may be secondary to the above syndromes.

Epidemiologic linkage is defined as one or more of the following : Exposure to environment, food, animal, materials, or objects that is suspected or confirmed to be contaminated with B. anthracis ; OR Exposure to the same environment, food, animal, materials, or objects as another person who has lab -confirmed anthrax; OR Consumption of the same food as another person who has laboratory -confirmed anthrax . Detection of B. anthracis or anthrax toxin genes by the LRN-validated PCR and/or sequencing in clinical speci mens collected from a normally sterile site or lesion of other affected tissue Note: As required by TAC, all B. anthracis isolates must be submitted to the DSHS Laboratory. B. cereus expressing anthrax toxin suspect isolates from patients with severe disease should be forwarded for confirmation. Arbovirus , neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive Neuroinvasive disease s: 10058 Cache Valley virus For the purposes of surveillance and reporting, arboviral disease cases are often categorized into two primary groups based on their clinical presentation: neuroinvasive disease and non - neuroinvasive disease. Many neuroinvasive disease su ch as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). These illnesses are usually characterized by the acute onset of fever with stiff neck, altered mental status, seizures, limb weakness, CSF pleocytosis, and/or abnormal neuroimaging. Less common neurological manifestations, such as cranial nerve palsies, also occur. AFP is characterized by rapid-onset extremity, facial, and/or respiratory weakness and Neuroinvasive Isolation of virus from, or demonstration of specific viral antigen or nucleic acid in, tissue, blood, CSF, or other body fluid, OR Four-fold or greater change in virus-specific quantitative antibody titers in paired sera, OR 7 10057 virus Eastern equine encephalitis virus flaccid muscle tone in the affected area; AFP may result from anterior myelitis, peri -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome). Meningitis is infection or inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain; symptoms can include fever, headache, photophobia, and nuchal rigidity. Encephal itis is infection or inflammation of the brain tissue itself and may present with fever, altered mental status, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits; meningitis may also be present simultaneously, known as meningoencephalitis. Most arboviruses are capab le of causing an acute systemic febrile illness (e.g., West Nile fever) that may include headache, myalgias, arthralgias, rash, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. Some viruses also can cause more characteristic clinical manifestations, such as severe polyar thralgia or arthritis due to chikungunya virus or other Clinical evidence of neuroinvasive disease: Meningitis, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, or other acute signs of central or peripheral neurologic dysfunction, as documented by a physician, AND Absence of a more likely clinical explanation Clinical evidence of non -neuroinvasive disease : Fever or chills as reported by the patient or a health -care provider, AND Absence of neuroinvasive disease, AND Absence of a more likely clinical explanation Neuroinvasive: Confirmed : A clinically compatible case (meets neuroinvasive clinical evidence cri teria) with laboratory confirmation Probable: A clinically compatible case (meets neuroinvasive clinical evidence criteria) with virus -specific IgM antibodies in CSF or serum but no other testing OR with lower levels of Virus-specific IgM antibodies in serum with confirmatory virus - specific neutralizing antibodies in the same or a later specimen, and negative neutralizing antibody results for potentially cross-reactive* arbo viruses endemic to the region where exposure occurred, OR Virus-specific IgM antibodies in CSF and a negative result for other IgM antibodies in CSF for potentially cross -reactive* arboviruses endemic to the region where exposure occurred Non-neuroinvasive Isolation of virus from, or demonstration of specific viral antigen or nucleic acid in, tissue, blood, or other body fluid, excluding CSF , OR Four-fold or greater change in virus-specific quantitative antibody titers in paired sera, OR Virus-specific IgM antibodies in serum with confirmatory virus - specific neutralizing antibodies in the same or a later specimen and negative neutralizing antibody results for potentially cross-reactive* arboviruses endemic to the region where exposure occu rred 10079 Jamestown Canyon virus 10063 virus West categories: virus disease 10073 Chikungunya virus disease 10093 Colorado tick fever virus disease 50237 Flavivirus disease, not otherwise specified 11712 Keystone virus neutralizing antibodies for potentially cross -reactive* arboviruses endemic to the region where exposure occurred. Non-neuroinvasive: Confirmed : A clinically compatible case (meets non - neuroinvasive clinical evidence criteria) with laboratory confirmation Probable: A clinically com patible case (meets non - neuroinvasive clinical evidence criteria) with virus -specific IgM antibodies in serum but no other testing OR with lower levels of neutralizing antibodies for potentially cross -reactive* arboviruses endemic to the region where expos ure occurred Note: If lab evidence, clinical manifestations, and exposure history cannot distinguish between two arboviruses (including dengue and Zika, listed as separate conditions), the case should be reported as \"Other arboviral diseases\" or \"Flaviviru s disease\" if the viruses are all flaviviruses. *Viruses in the same genus (the majority of pathogenic arboviruses are in the flavivirus, alphavirus, or orthobunyavirus genus) are generally considered potentially cross -reactive. Consider area of exposure, clinical manifestations of each arbovirus, and level of arbovirus activity when assessing which viruses must be ruled out . 9 disease 10072 Other arboviral diseases, not otherwise specified disease are asymptomatic. Live worms, passed in stool or occasionally from the mouth, anus, or nose, are often the first recogn ized sign of infection. Larval migration may result in pulmonary manifestations such as wheezing, cough, fever, eosinophilia and pulmonary infiltration in some patients. Light infections may result in minor abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, and loss of appe tite. Heavy infections may result in severe abdominal pain, fatigue, vomiting, or weight loss. In children, these symptoms can result in nutrient deficiencies resulting in growth retardation and/or cognitive impairment. Serious complications are rare but c an be fatal and include intestinal obstruction by a bolus of worms, or obstruction of bile duct, pancreatic duct or appendix by one or more adult worms.

Candida auris, Clinical Case s an emerging multidrug -resistant yeast that can cause invasive infections and is associated with high mortality. Some strains of C. auris are resistant to the three major classes of antifungals, severely limiting treatment options. C. auris can sp read in healthcare settings and cause outbreaks. C. auris can colonize patients' skin and other body sites, perhaps indefinitely, and colonization poses a risk both for invasive infection and transmission. C. auris persists in the healthcare environment fo r weeks, and certain routinely used disinfectants in healthcare settings are not effective against the organism. Past epidemiological investigations have demonstrated that one -third to half of all patients on a given unit, especially in a long -term care se tting, can become colonized with C. auris within weeks of an index patient entering the facility. Confirmed : A case that has confirmatory laboratory test. Probable : A case that has an isolate that is a Candida haemulonii or a yeast isolate that was unable to be identified that is from a person who is within same household, same healthcare facility, or in a healthcare facility that commonly shares patients with a facility, with another person with confirmatory laboratory evidence. Confirmatory laborat ory evidence: Detection of C. auris from any body site using either culture or a culture independent diagnostic test (CIDT) (e.g., Polymerase Chain Reaction [PCR]). Note: As required by TAC, all isolates identified as Candida auris must be submitted to t he DSHS Laboratory. Any yeast isolate identified as C. haemulonii or any yeast isolate that had identification attempted without successful identification can be sent to DSHS Laboratory. Please contact a DSHS HAI Epidemiologist or the DSHS Laboratory for additional information on available laboratory support Carbapenem - resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) 77924 , are gram -negative bacilli that are resistant to at least one of the carbapenem antibiotics (ertapenem, meropenem, doripenem, or imipenem) or produce a carbapenemase (an enzyme that can make them resistant to carbapenem antibiotics). A Klebsiella species or E. coli from any body site that is laboratory confirmed. Klebsiella species or E. coli that are resistant to any carbapenem, including meropenem, 14 CRE can colonize or infect any body site and can cause infections including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, wound infections, and meningitis. Common causes of CRE infections in healthcare settings inclu de Klebsiella species, and Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes, previously known as Enterobacter aerogenes, does meet the case definition. Carbapenem resistance by Enterobacterales can occur by many mechanisms, including the production of a metallo - beta- lactamase or a carbapenemase (such as Klebsiella carbapenemase, KPC) which can from one Enterobacterales to another. Metallo -beta- lactamases such as New De lhi metallo -beta-lactamase (NDM), are more common outside the United States. CRE can also have additional resistance mechanisms such as Verona Integron -Mediated Metallo -B-lactamase (VIM) to be non -susceptible to many othe r classes of commonly used antibiotics.

If the CRE isolate is sent to the DSHS lab for additional testing, use the submitting lab's antibiotic susceptibility testing results to meet the epi case criteria. Chagas disease, acute 12041 Chagas disease is a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. The acute phase is characterized by the first 8 weeks of infection, detectable parasitemia, and asymptomatic (most common) or symptomatic manifestations of disease which can Identification of T. cruzi by microscopy including: Microscopic examination of T. cruzi by: 15 include any of the following: Fever, malaise, rash, body aches, headache, loss o f appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, Chagoma (nodular swelling at site of (unilateral swelling of the eyelid), acute myocarditis, and/or meningoencephalitis. Confirmed : A case (asymptomat ic or symptomatic) that has confirmatory laboratory testing. Asymptomatic individuals must have evidence of parasitemia based on microscopy or PCR. Notes: T. cruzi IgM tests are unreliable and are thus insufficient evidence of infection. Samples forwarded to CDC for confirmatory testing which test negative cannot be classified as cases. Congenital infections are considered acute up to 8 weeks of age and can be diagn osed by confirmatory tests. Infants <12 months and epidemiologically -linked need to be retested after 12 months of age. Please refer to the DSHS website for guidance on Chagas disease testing: www.dshs.texas.gov/IDCU/disease/Chagas/humans/ Wet mount - motile trypanosomes OR Thick & thin smears - Giemsa stain OR Detection of T. cruzi DNA by PCR OR Positive diagnostic serology confirmed by testing at CDC Note: No single supportive test has the sensitivity and specificity to be relied on alone, thus two different methods or antibodies specific to T. cruzi are used. Chagas disease, chronic indeterminate 12043 Following the acute phase, most infected people enter into a prolonged, asymptomatic form of disease (called \"chronic indeterminate\") during which few or no parasites are found in the blood. During this time, most people are unaware of their infection. Man y people remain asymptomatic for life and never develop chronic Chagas -related symptoms. Confirmed : An asymptomatic case >12 months of age with confirmatory lab results Probable : An asymptomatic case >12 months of age with a single T. cruzi IgG positive assay* with an IV (reference interval) 3.5, OR positive blood donor screening and a T. cruzi IgG positive assay* with an IV <3.5 (or no IV provided), OR two T. cruzi IgG positive assays* that are different test formats or kits (e.g. Lateral Flow Assay, Wiener ELISA, Hemagen ELISA) Suspect: An asymptomatic case 12 months of age with positive (reactive) blood donor screening OR a single T. cruzi IgG positive assay* wi th an IV <3.5 (or no IV provided) Detection of antibod y specific to T. cruzi by TWO distinct diagnostic tests performed at CDC Note: No single supportive test has the sensitivity and specificity to be relied on alone, thus two different methods or antibodies specific to T. cruzi are used. 16 *DSHS or commercial lab Notes: Samples forwarded to CDC for confirmatory testing which test negative cannot be classified as cases. Patients with positive diagnostic serology should have confirmatory testing performed at the CDC. Patients with positive blood donor screening should have T. cruzi IgG testing at a commercial or public health lab. Women with chronic indeterminate disease can transmit infection to their unborn babies. Infants <12 months of age with a mother from an endemic area, in absence of direct detection of the organism, cannot be classified or ruled out due to maternal antibodies; perform serology at 12 months of age and classify based on presence or absence of symptoms as chronic symptoma tic or chronic indeterminate case definition . Please refer to the DSHS website for guidance on Chagas disease testing: www.dshs.texas.gov/IDCU/disease/Chagas/humans/ Chagas disease, chronic symptomatic 12042 Much like the chronic indeterminate phase, the chronic symptomatic phase of disease (more than 8 weeks post infection) is characterized by undetectable parasitemia. However, an estimated 20 -30% of in fected people will develop debilitating and sometimes life -threatening medical problems over the course of their lives. Complications of chronic Chagas disease may include heart rhythm abnormalities that can cause sudden death, a dilated heart that doesn't pump blood well, and/or a dilated esophagus or colon, leading to difficulties with eating or passing stool.

The virus (SARS -CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19), first identified in Wuhan, China in 2019 is not the same as coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold. The viru s is distinct from although closely related to both SARS -CoV and MERS -CoV. Epidemiologic findings indicate COVID -19 may be less severe than SARS or MERS, but evidence suggests that the virus is more contagious than its predecessors. SARS -CoV-2 is a newly identified pathogen and it is assumed there was no pre -existing human immunity to the virus in 2019 and early in 2020. There are risk factors that increase the risk of an individual's illness being more severe. Those at highest risk for severe disease and death include people aged over 60 years (especially those 85 years and older) and those with underlying conditions, including but not limited to obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory or kidney disease, immunosuppressi on from solid organ transplant, and sickle cell disease. A complete list can be found at: People with Certain Medical Conditions | CDC . Disease in children mostly appears to be relatively mild, and there is evidence that a significant proportion of infections across all age groups are asymptomatic, or presymptomatic at the time of testing. Asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals who are i nfected may transmit SARS -CoV-2. Symptoms of COVID -19 are non -specific and the disease presentation can range from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and death. People with COVID -19 generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respirato ry symptoms and fever 3 -5 days after infection (mean incubation period 3 -5 days, range 1 - more than 14 days). DSHS is updating the COVID -19 reporting and case classification criteria to better meet long -term surveillance goals for tracking this disease. At this time, universal case investigation and contact tracing is no longer an effective intervention for containing spread. Further, surveillance for probable cases based on *Laboratory evidence using a method approved or authorized by the FDA1 or designated authority*: Confirmatory** laboratory evidence : Detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA in a clinical or post- mortem specimen using a diagnostic molecular amplification test performed by a CLIA -certified provider***, OR Detection of SARS -CoV-2 in a clinical or post -mortem specimen by genomic sequencing****. Presumptive** laboratory evidence: Detection of SARS -CoV-2 specific antigen in a clinical or post -mortem specimen using a diagnostic test performed by a CLIA - certified provider. Supportive** laboratory evidence: Detection of SARS -CoV-2 specific antigen by immunocytochemistry OR 20 clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to known cases is no longer necessary. COVID -19 case ascertainment based on positive serologic test results is also no longer relevant due to high community seroprevalence. For these reasons, surveillance should focus on incident cases only. In accordance with the Council of State and Territori al Epidemiologists (CSTE) update to the standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID -19) Interim -22-ID-01, DSHS has adopted the following case classification strategy effective January 1, 202 3; The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team.

FDA Emergency Use Authorizations Emergency Use Authorization | FDA and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID - 19) | FDA *. On March 13, 2020, the President issued a Memorandum on Expanding State -Approved Diagnostic Tests: \"Should additional States request flexibility to authorize laboratories within the State to develop and perform tests used to detect COVID -19, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with law, to facilitate the request.\" **. The terms confirmatory, presumptive, and supportive are categorical labels used here to standardize case classifications for public health surveillance. The terms should not be used to interpret the utility or validity of any laboratory test methodology. *** Includes those tests performed under a CLIA certifica te of waiver. **** Some genomic sequencing tests that have been authorized for emergency use by the FDA do not require an initial PCR result to be 21 Detection of SARS -CoV-2 specific antigen in a clinical or post-mortem specimen using a diagnostic test performed by a CLIA -certified provider* *Includes those tests performed under a CLIA certificate of waiver NOTE: Testing performed by individuals at home using over - the-counter test kits is considered supportive laboratory evidence and should not be included in case counts due to lack of CLIA oversight. Clinical Criteria for Reporting: N/A Epidemiologic Linkage Criteria for Reporting: N/A Vital Records Criteria for Reporting: A person whose death certificate lists COVID -19 disease or SARS - CoV-2 or an equivalent term as an underlying cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death. Criteria to distinguish a new case of this disease or condition from reports or notifications which should not be enumerated as a new case for surveillance: The following should be enumerated as a new case: Person was most recently enumerated as a confirm ed or probable case with onset date (if available) or first positive specimen collection date for that classification >90 days prior, OR generated. Genomic sequencing results may be all the public health agency receives. 22 SARS -CoV-2 sequencing results from the new positive specimen and a positive specimen from the most recent previous case demonstrate a different lineage, OR Person was previously reported but not enumerated as a confirmed or probable case (i.e., suspect), but now meets the criteria for a confirmed or probable case. Some individuals, e.g., severely immunocompromised persons, can shed SARS -CoV-2, as detected by molecular amplification tests, >90 days after infection. For severely immunocompromised individuals, clinical judgment should be used to determine if a repeat positive test is likely t o result from long-term shedding and, therefore, not be enumerated as a new case. Severe immunocompromise conditions include chemotherapy for cancer, untreated HIV infection with CD4 T lymphocyte count <200, combined primary immunodeficiency disorder, and receipt of prednisone >20mg/day for more than 14 days. Repeat suspect cases should not be enumerated. 23 Contaminated sharps injury A contaminated sharps injury that occurs in a heath care setting that is contaminated with human blood or body fluids should be reported per the below guidelines. Contaminated sharps injuries in private facilities must be documented per OSHA guidelines. http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hospital/hazards/sharps/sharps .html Contaminated sharps injuries in Texas public facilities (government entities) are reported to DSHS Emerging and Acute Infectious Disease Branch.

Cronobacter Cronobacter is a bacteria that has been found in a variety of dry foods, including powdered infant formula, powdered milk, herbal teas, and starches. It has also been found in water. Cronobacter illnesses are rare, but they can be deadly for infants and ca n be serious among people with weakened immune systems and people 65 years and older. Cronobacter is very rare with fewer than 5 cases reported to the CDC annually. Cronobacter is not reportable in Texas, however, since in the recent past there have been o utbreak and incidents associated with powdered infant formula, it is recommended that infections with Cronobacter from infants (<12 months of age) are reported to the public health authorities.

Vomiting and low -grade fever also may occur . Confirmed: A laboratory -confirmed case with clinical compatibility Probable : A clinically compatible case that is epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case Note: A case should not be counted as a new case if laboratory results were reported within 365 days of a previously reported infection in the same individual, unless additi onal information is available indicating a separate infection Detection of Cyclospora organisms by microscopic examination in stool, intestinal fluid/aspirate, or intestinal biopsy specimens, OR Detection of Cyclospora DNA (by PCR) in intestinal fluid/aspirate, or intestinal biopsy specimens Cysticercosis 12031 Cysticercosis is a tissue infection caused by the larval form of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium . Infection occurs when the tapeworm eggs are ingested, hatch into larvae, and migrate to tissues where they form cysticerci (cysts). The signs and symptoms of cysticercosis reflect the development of cysticerci in various sites. Subcutaneous cysticerci ma y be visible or palpable. When cysticerci are found in the brain, the condition is called neurocysticercosis, which can cause diverse manifestations including seizures, mental disturbances, focal neurologic deficits, and signs of space -occupying intracere bral lesions. Death can occur suddenly. Extracerebral cysticercosis can cause ocular, cardiac, or spinal lesions with associated signs and symptoms. Asymptomatic subcutaneous nodules and calcified intramuscular nodules can be Labora tory confirmation of the presence of cysticercus in tissue Notes: Documentation of biopsy or imaging results is required. Demonstration of T. solium eggs and proglottids in the feces are diagnostic of (see Taenia solium and undifferentiated Taeniasis ), not cysticercosis. Persons who are found to have eggs or proglottids in their feces should be evaluate d serologically since autoinfection, resulting in Diagnosis of neurocysticercosis is usually made by MRI or CT brain scans in order to identify the presence of cysticerci. If surgery is necessary, confirmation of the diagnosis can be made by demonstrating the cysticercus in the tissue involved (biopsy). Radiographs can identify calcified cysticerci in tissues other than the brain. 26 cysticercosis, can occur. Blood tests are available to help diagnose an infection but are not always accurate. While suggestive, it does not necessarily prove that cysticercosis is a potentially fatal febrile illness caused by infection with any of the four dengue viruses (DENV -1, -2, -3 and -4). Dengue is transmitted primarily through the bite of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. For the purposes of surveillance and reporting, based on their clinical presentation, dengue cases can be categorized into three primary groups: dengue -like illness, dengue, and severe dengue. Clinical evidence of dengue -like illness: Fever as reported by th e patient or healthcare provider Clinical evidence of dengue: Fever as reported by the patient or healthcare provider and the presence of one or more of the following signs and symptoms: nausea/vomiting rash aches and pains (i.e. headache, retro -orbital p ain, arthralgia, myalgia) tourniquet test positive leukopenia (a total white blood cell count of <5,000/mm\u00b3) abdominal pain persistent vomiting extravascular fluid accumulation mucosal bleeding liver enlargement >2 centimeters increasing hematocrit concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet count Clinical evidence of severe dengue: Dengue with any one or more of the following scenarios: severe plasma leakage evidenced by hypovolemic shock and/or extravascular fluid accumulation with respiratory distress severe bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or vagina as defined by requirement for medical intervention including intravenous fluid resuscitation or blood transfusion Detection of DENV nuclei c acid in serum, plasma, CSF, other body fluid or tissue by validated RT - PCR, OR Detection of DENV antigen in tissue, by IHC, OR Detection in serum or plasma of DENV NS1 antigen by a validated immunoassay, OR Cell culture isolation of DENV from serum, plasma, or CSF specimen, OR Detection of IgM anti -DENV in serum or CSF in a traveler returning from a dengue endemic area without o ngoing transmission of another flavivirus, clinical evidence of co - infection with a flavivirus or recent vaccination against a flavivirus , OR Detection of IgM anti -DENV in serum or CSF in a person living in a dengue endemic or non - endemic area of the US without evidence of other flavivirus transmission, OR IgM anti -DENV seroconversion by validated immunoassay in 27 severe organ involvement, including any of the following: elevated l iver transaminases: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1,000 units per liter (U/L) impaired level of consciousness and/or diagnosis of encephalitis, encephalopathy, or meningitis heart or other organ involvement including myocarditis, cholecystitis, and pancreatitis Confirmed: A clinically compatible case -like illness, dengue, or severe dengue with confirmatory laboratory results Probable : A clinically compatible case of dengue -like illness, dengue, or severe dengue AND one of the following: Detection of IgM anti -DENV by validated immunoassay in serum or CSF in a person living in a dengue endemic or non - endemic area of the US with evidence o f other flavivirus transmission or recent vaccination against a flavivirus Detection of IgM anti -DENV by validated immunoassay in serum or CSF in a traveler returning from a dengue endemic area with ongoing transmission of another flavivirus, clinical evidence of co -infection with one of these flaviviruses, or recent vaccination against a flavivirus Suspect: A clinically compatible case of dengue -like illness, or severe dengue with an epidemiologic linkage, defined as: Travel to a dengue endemic country or presence at a location with an ongoing outbreak within two weeks prior to onset of an acute febrile illness or dengue, OR Association in time and place with a confirmed or probable dengue case acute (i.e., collected <5 days o f illness onset) and convalescent (i.e., collected >5 days after illness onset) serum specimens, OR IgG anti -DENV seroconversion or 4 -fold rise in titer in serum specimens collected >2 weeks apart, and confirmed by a neutralization test (e.g., plaque reduction neutralization test) with a >4 -fold higher end point titer as compared to other flaviviruses tested Diphtheria 10040 An upper respiratory tract illness with an adherent membrane of the nose, pharynx, tonsils, or larynx OR an infection of a non - respiratory anatomical site (e.g., skin, wound, conjunctiva, ear, genital mucosa) Isolation of Corynebacterium diphtheriae from a clinical specimen, AND Confirmation of toxin -production by Elek test or by another 28 Confirmed: A clinically compatible case that is either laboratory confirmed, OR epidemiologically linked to a laboratory -confirmed case OR An infection at a non -respiratory anatomical site (e.g., skin, wound, conjunctiva, ear, genital mucosa) with: Isolation of toxin assisted laser desorption/ionization -time of flight mass spectrometry) diagnosis for C. diphtheria , when used alone, do not confirm toxin production. These tests, when used, should always be combined with a test that confirms toxin production, such as the Elek test. Individuals without evidence of clinical criteria as described by the diphtheria surveillance case definition but for whom toxin - producing C. diphtheria is confirmed via laboratory testing (isolation and toxigenicity testing by modified Elek test or other validated test capable of confirming toxin -production) should not be classified as cases.

Transmission occurs through the ingestion of tapeworm eggs in contaminated food, water, soil, dog feces, or on the contaminated coats of dogs and cats. Infection may also occur through the ingestion of cysts in the undercooked internal organs of infected intermediate hosts, such as sheep, goats and swine. Many infections are asymptomatic for years before the growin g cysts cause clinical signs and symptoms associated with the affected organs.

Not applicable - See note Escherichia coli , Shiga toxin - are transmitted by ingesting raw aquatic plants or water contaminated with immature larvae, usually in locations around domestic and wild ruminants (commonly sheep, cattle and goats). Infection may or may not be sympyomatic. In early infect ion (acute phase), the immature larval flukes migrate through the intestinal wall, the abdominal cavity, and the liver tissue, into the bile ducts, where they develop into mature adult flukes. Symptoms may include fever; gastrointestinal problems such as n ausea, vomiting and diarrhea; a swollen liver (hepatomegaly); liver function abnormalities, skin rashes; shortness of breath; and abdominal pain or tenderness. The chronic phase (after the parasite settles in the bile ducts), is marked by inflammation and hyperplasia and thickening of the bile ducts and gall bladder, leading to biliary lithiasis or obstruction. Symptoms of this phase may include: biliary colic, nausea, intolerance to fatty food, right upper quadrant pain, epigastric pain, obstructive jaundi ce, and pruritus, are the result of a blockade in the biliary tract and inflammation in the gall bladder.

Hantavirus infection, non-HPS 11610 Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome 11590 Hantaviruses are rodent -borne viruses that can be transmitted to humans. Patients with hantavirus infection typically present with nonspecific signs and symptoms including fever, myalgia, headache, and chills. After the prodromal phase, symptoms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) may develop. Non-HPS hantavirus infection is a febrile illness with non - specific signs and symptoms including fever, chills, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms, but no cardio - pulmonary symptoms. Clinical laboratory findings may include hemoconcentration, left shi ft in white blood cell count, neutrophilic leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and circulating immunoblasts. HPS is an acute febrile illness characterized by non -specific viral symptoms including fever, chills, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms, and one or more of the following clinical features: Bilateral diffuse interstitial edema, OR Detection of hantavirus -specific ribonucleic acid sequence in clinical specimens, OR Detection of hantavirus antigen by IHC in lung biopsy or autopsy tissues *Due to the high rate of false positives at commercial labs, a sample should be forwarded to DSHS for confirmatory testing 34 Clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), OR Radiographic evidence of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, OR Unexplained respiratory illness resulting in death, and includes autopsy examination demonstrating noncardiogenic pulmonary edema without an identifiable cause, OR Healthcare record with a diagn osis of HPS , OR Death certificate that lists HPS as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death Confirmed: A clinically compatible case of HPS or non -HPS hantavirus infection with confirmatory laboratory results uremic syndrome, post - diarrheal (HUS) 11550 Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by the acute onset of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal injury, and low platelet count. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) also is characterized by these features but can include central nervous system (CNS) involvement and fever and can have a more gradual onset. Most cases of HUS (but few cases of TTP) occur after an acute gastrointestinal illness (usually diarrheal). Confirmed : An acute illness diagnosed as HUS or TTP that both meets the laboratory criteria and began within 3 weeks after onset of an episode of acute or bloody diarrhea Probable : An acute illness diagnosed as HUS or TTP that meets the laboratory criteria in a patient who does not have a clear history of acute or bloody diarrhea in preceding 3 weeks, OR An acute illness diagnosed as HUS or TTP, that a) has onset within 3 weeks after onset of an acute or bloody diarrhea and b) meets the laboratory criteria except that microangiopathic changes are not confirmed Note: See Shiga toxin -producing Escherichia coli (STEC ) as cases that meet the HUS case criteria should also be reported as a \"Suspect\" STEC case, unless other criteria is met for another case definition. The following are both present at some time during the illness: Anemia (acute onset) with microangiopathic changes (i.e., schistocytes, burr cells, or helmet cells) on peripheral blood smear, AND Renal injury (acute onset) evidenced by either hematuria, proteinuria, or elevated creatinine level (i.e., greater than or equal to 1.0 mg/dL in a child aged less than 13 years or greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL in a person aged greater than or equal to 13 years, or greater than or equal to 50% increase over baseline) Note: A low platelet count can usually, but not always, be detected early in the illness, but it can then become normal or even high. If a platelet count obtained 35 within 7 days after onset of the acute gastrointestinal illness is not less than 150,000/mm3, other diagnoses should be considered.

In most hepatit is E outbreaks, the highest rates of clinically evident disease have been in young to middle -aged adults; lower disease rates in younger age groups can be the result of anicteric and/or subclinical HEV infection. No evidence of chronic infection has been d etected in long -term follow -up of patients with hepatitis E. The case fatality rate is low except in pregnant women where it can reach 20% among those infected during the third trimester of pregnancy.

Other symptoms may include cough, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, blood in the stool, loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, or pale skin. Light hookworm infections generally produce few or no clinical effects. In heavy infections, symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea and anorexia. Chronic blood loss at the site of the intestinal attachment of adult worms can lead to anemia. Children with heavy long -term infections may have impaired gr owth and delayed mental development.

Any case of human infection with an influenza A virus tha t is different from currently circulating human influenza H1 and H3 viruses is classified as a suspect case until the confirmation process is complete. Note: Typically, sporadic novel/variant influenza cases will have a history of either close contact with ill animals known to transmit novel subtypes of influenza A (such as wild birds or poultry, swine, or other mammals) OR travel, within 14 days, to any country where a novel influenza A virus (such as highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1) has been recently identified in animals or people. species or from genetic re - assortment between animal and human viruses are also novel/variant subtypes or strains. Methods available for detection of cur rently circulating human influenza viruses at public health laboratories (e.g., rRT -PCR) will also detect suspected novel/variant subtypes and strains. Initial confirmation that a specific influenza A virus represents a novel/variant virus will be performe d by CDC's influenza laboratory. Currently, only viral isolation, RT-PCR, gene sequencing, or a 4-fold rise in strain -specific serum antibody titers are considered confirmatory for case classification purposes. Influenza -associated pediatric mortality 11061 An influenza -associated death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness that was confirmed to be influenza by an appropriate laboratory or rapid diagnostic test. Th ere should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death. Influenza -associated deaths in all persons aged <18 years should be reported. A death should not be reported if there is no laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection, t he influenza illness is followed by full recovery to baseline health status prior to death, the death occurs in a person 18 years of age or older, or after review and consultation there is an alternative agreed upon cause of death which is unrelated to an infectious process (For example, a child with a positive influenza test whose death clearly resulted from trauma after a car accident would not qualify as a case.

The Leishmania parasite is transmitted via the bite of phlebotomine sand flies. There are several forms of the disease in humans : cutaneous, the most common, which causes skin lesions; visceral, which may affect multiple internal organs, including the liver, spleen, and bone marrow; and mucosal, a less common form that affects mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, or throat. Most l eishmaniasis cases reported in Texas are the cutaneous form and are travel -associated, albeit autochthonous cases occur occasionally. Cutaneous leishmaniasis infection can present as one or more skin sores weeks or months after a sand fly bite. Over time, the sores may change in size and appearance \u2014they may start out as papules or nodules and may end up as ulcers which might scab over. Lesions can heal spontaneously within weeks to months, or last for a year or more. Some Leishmania strains can disseminate to cause mucosal lesions (espundia) years after the primary cutaneous lesion has healed. Without treatment, this sequela can progress and lead to destruction of the naso - oropharyngeal mucosa, which can be severely disfiguring. Visceral leishmaniasis infect ion can be asymptomatic or result in manifestations such as fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. Severe cases of visceral leishmaniasis are often fatal without treatment.

Lyme disease 11080 A systemic, tickborne disease with protean manifestations, including dermatologic, rheumatologic, neurologic, and cardiac abnormalities. The most common clinical marker for the disease is erythema migrans (EM), the initial skin lesion that occurs in 60-80% of patients. For purposes of surveillance, EM is defined as a skin lesion that typically begins as a red macule or papule and expands over a period of days to weeks to form a large round lesion, often with partial central clearing. Secondary lesions also may occur. Annular erythematous lesions occurring within several hours of a tick bite represent hypersensitivity reactions and do not qualify as EM. For most patients, the expanding EM lesion is accompanied by other acute symptoms, particularly fatigue, fever, headache, mildly stiff neck, arthralgia, or myalgia. These symptoms are typically intermittent.

Infection typically occurs through direct contact with contaminated soil or water via subcutaneous inoculation, ingestion, or inhalation. An estimated 165,000 human melioidosis cases occur annually, mainly in the highly endemic areas of southeast Asia and northern Australia. Melioidosis is an emerging infectious disease in the Americas, with cases reporting travel to Mexico, Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands . A recent investigation into two Mississippi melioidosis cases established the presence of B. pseudomallei in the environment in the U.S. The median incubation period is 9 days but ranges from a few hours to decades after exposure. Clinical Criteria: In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, at least one of the following signs or symptoms: Fever , muscle anorexia , distress , abdominal discomfort , joint pain, disorientation , weight loss , seizure , organ abscess (liver, lung, spleen, prostate, or brain) , AND/OR encephalomyelitis/meningitis/extra -meningeal disease Confirmed: A case that is lab confirmed Probable: A case that meets presumpt ive laboratory criteria AND one of the following: clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage; OR vital records criteria and epidemiologic linkage; OR other criteria and epidemiologic linkage.

Mpox 11801 Mpox is an illness typically characterized by a rash that may be located on the genitals, anus, hands, feet, chest, face, or mouth. The characteristic rash associated with mpox lesions involves the following: deep -seated and well -circumscribed lesions, often w ith central umbilication; and lesion progression specific sequential stages \u2014macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and scabs.; this can sometimes be confused with other diseases that are more commonly encountered in clinical practice (e.g., secondar y syphilis, herpes, and varicella zoster). Historically, sporadic accounts of patients co -infected with the mpox virus and other infectious agents (e.g., varicella zoster, syphilis) have been reported, so patients with a characteristic rash should be consi dered for testing, even if other tests are positive. The average incubation period for symptom onset is 7 - 14 days with a range of 5 -21 days. The causative agent is the monkeypox virus which belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae.

MIS-C is characterized by fever, elevated laboratory markers of systemic inflammation, and multiple organ system dysfunction including cardiovascular, mucocutaneous, gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurologic, and renal involvement. Some patients may also present with respiratory failure or radiographic pulmonary abnormalities, which may reflect associated pulmonary hyperinflammation, a phenotypic overlap with COVID -19 viral pneumonia, or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Patients with MIS -C are often critically ill, with the majority requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 1 -3% requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Mortality among MIS -C patients has been estimat ed to be 1 - 2%. In accordance with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) update to the Standardized Case Definition for Surveillance of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with SARS -CoV-2 Infection 22- ID-02, DSHS has adopted the following case classification strategy effective January 1, 2023; Confirmatory laboratory evidence: Detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA in a clinical specimen*** up to 60 days prior to or during hospitalization, or in a post - mortem specimen using a diagnostic molecular amplification test (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), OR Detection of SARS -CoV-2 specific antigen in a clinical specimen*** up to 60 days prior to or during hospitalization, or in a post -mortem specimen, OR Detection of SARS -CoV-2 specific antibodies^ in serum, plasma, or whole blood 50 Confirmed : Meets the clinical criteria AND the confirmatory laboratory evidence. Probable: Meets the clinical criteria AND the epidemiologic linkage criteria. Suspect: Meets the vital records criteria. Note: For cases initially identified as suspect, jurisdictions may conduct investigation of clinical and laboratory records to determine if confirmed or probable case criteria are met. Comment: To p rovide consistency in case classification, review of case information and assignment of final case classification for all suspected MIS -C cases will be done by experts in national MIS-C surveillance at Texas DSHS Central Office and staff at CDC. Clinical Criteria An illness in a person aged <21 years characterized by all of the following, in the absence of a more likely alternative diagnosis*: Subjective or documented fever (temperature 38.0 C) AND Clinical severity requiring hospitalization or resulting in death AND Evidence of systemic inflammation indicated by C -reactive protein 3.0 mg/dL (30 mg/L) AND New onset manifestations in at least two of the following categories: 1. ................................ ................................ ................................

Detection of antinucleocapsid antibody is indicative of SARS -CoV-2 infection, while anti -spike protein antibody may be induced either by COVID -19 vaccination or by SARS -CoV-2 infection. Note: The categorical labels used here to stratify laboratory evidence are intended to support the standardization of case classifications for public health surveillance. The categorical labels should not be used to interpret the utility or valid ity of any laboratory test methodology. 51 OR Coronary artery dilatation, aneurysm, or ectasia, OR Troponin elevated above laboratory normal range, or indicated as elevated in a clinical note 2. ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ..............................

These cases should not be reported to state MIS -C surveillance. 52 ** Clinician documentation of shock meets this criterion. Epidemiologic Linkage Criteria Close contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID -19 disease in the 60 days prior to hospitalization. Close contact is generally defined as being within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes (cumulative over a 24 -hour pe riod). However, it depends on the exposure level and setting; for example, in the setting of an aerosol -generating procedure in healthcare settings without proper personal protective equipment (PPE), this may be defined as any duration. Vital Records Crit eria A person aged <21 years whose death certificate lists MIS -C or multisystem inflammatory syndrome as an underlying cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death. Criteria to distinguish a new case of this disease or condition from r eports or notifications which should not be enumerated as a new case for surveillance: A case should be enumerated as a new case if the person had never previously been enumerated as a case OR if the person was most recently enumerated as a case with illn ess onset date (if available) or hospital admission date >90 days prior.

Confirmed : A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed Probable : A clinically compatible case that is epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case Detection of norovirus DNA (PCR) in stool or vomitus. Identification of norovirus can best be made from stool specimens taken within 48 to 72 hours after onset of symptoms. Virus can sometimes be found in stool samples taken as late as 2 weeks after recovery.) OR Detection of norovirus antigen in stool, Note: The etiology of gastrointestinal outbreaks should be confirmed by submitting specimens to the DSHS Laboratory. Sequencing for norovirus strains is available. 54 Novel Coronavirus 10575 *For COVID -19, please see COVID -19 (Novel Coronavirus 2019) This section refers to diseses caused by novel coronaviruses other than Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) caused by the virus SARS -CoV-2, which is described in a previous section. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory illness ca used by a novel coronavirus. SARS was first identified in 2003 with the SARS -associated coronavirus (SARS -CoV). SARS -CoV has not been detected since the 2003 outbreak ended. However, in 2012 a new coronavirus causing an acute severe respiratory disease was detected in countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula --Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV). Symptoms of a novel coronavirus causing an acute respiratory syndrome may include fever and cough in addition to pneumonia or acute respirator y distress syndrome (ARDS). Clinical criteria for the specific novel coronavirus will be determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Case definitions for confirmed, probable and suspect cases may be redefined based on the specific novel coronavirus. Additional ly, CDC may require that patients undergo testing for alternate causes of infection including all clinically indicated tests for community acquired pneumonia, before being considered a probable or suspect case. Confirmed: A person who has laboratory conf irmation of infection with a novel coronavirus Probable: A person who meets the criteria for a suspect case, has absent or inconclusive* laboratory results for novel coronavirus infection, and is a close contact** of a laboratory confirmed case Suspect : A person who meets the clinical criteria AND at least one of the following: 1) Has recent travel history to any country where a novel coronavirus has been recently identified in people 2) Has had close contact** with a symptomatic person who recently traveled to any country where a novel coronavirus has been recently identified in people Identification of a novel coronavirus that is different from currently circulating human coronaviruses as confirmed by CDC's laboratory, by public health laboratories using CDC -approved protocols for a specific novel strain, or by labs using an FDA approved test for a specific novel strain Initial confirmation that a specific coronavirus represents a novel virus will be determined by the CDC Other laboratory confirmation criteria may be defined by CDC for the specific novel coronavirus 55 3) Is a member of a cluster of patients with severe acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever and pneum onia requiring hospitalization) of unknown etiology in which a novel coronavirus is being evaluated, in consultation with state and local health departments 4) Has a recent history of other relevant exposures, as defined by CDC *Examples of laboratory r esults that may be considered inconclusive include a positive test on a single PCR target, a positive test with an assay that has limited performance data available, or a negative test on an inadequate specimen. **See http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case -def.html for current MERS Patient Under Investigation (PUI) criteria for suspect cases and for the definition of \"close contact\". Outbreaks, exotic diseases, and unusual expression of disease - shock syndrome 11700 In addition to specified reportable conditions, any outbreak, exotic disease, or unusual group expression of disease that may be of public health concern should be reported by the most expeditious means available . Paragonimiasis 80664 Paragonimiasis (lung fluke trematode) is transmitted by eatin g inadequately cooked crustaceans (primarily crayfish in the US) that are infected with the parasite. Disease most frequently involves the lungs. Initial signs and symptoms may be diarrhea and abdominal pain followed sever al days later by fever, chest pain, and fatigue. The symptoms may also include a dry cough, which later becomes productive with rusty -colored or blood - Microscopic identification of Paragonimus eggs in feces, sputum, pleural fluid, CSF, or pus, OR Identification of worms or eggs in biopsies of pulmonary, cerebral, 56 tinged sputum on exertion, and pleuritic chest pain. X -ray findings include cysts is not uncommon, with flukes found in such sites as the CNS, subcutaneous tissues, intestinal wall, peritoneal cavity, liver, lymph nodes and genitourinary tract. Infection usually lasts for years, and the infected person may be asymptomatic. Paragonimiasis may be mistaken for tuberculosis, clinically and on chest X -rays. Confirmed: A case that is laboratory confirmed Probable : A clinically compatible case with Detection of Paragonimus antibodies by CF, EIA, or immunoblot, OR Positive skin test for Paragonimus, OR History of ingestion of inadequately cooked crustaceans and marked eosinophilia with total WBC count in the normal range or supportive x -ray findings subcutaneous, or intra - abdominal nodules or cystic lesions Pertussis 10190 A cough illness lasting at least 14 days AND at least one of the following additional symptoms in the absence of a more likely diagnosis : Paroxysmal coughing, OR Inspiratory \"whoop,\" OR Post-tussive vomiting, OR Apnea (with or without cyanosis) Confirmed: A person with an acute cough illness of any duration who is laboratory con firmed Probable : In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, a person who is not laboratory confirmed (not t ested, tests are negative, or tested by serology or DFA), and is either: A person with an acute cough illness of any duration, with At least one of the following signs or symptoms: Paroxysms of coughing, OR Inspiratory whoop, OR Post-tussive vomiting, OR Apnea (with or without cyanosis) Isolation (culture) of Bordetella pertussis from a clinical specimen, OR Positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Bordetella pertussis Note: Because B. pertussis can be difficult to culture, a negative culture result does not rule out pertussis . Negative PCR results do not require investigation unless reported as a suspected case by a healthcare provider. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining of a patient's s pecimen and serological laboratory results (pertussis IgA, IgG or IgM) are 57 AND epidemiological linkage to a laboratory confirmed case OR A person who meets the clinical case definition. NOT considered confirmatory for pertussis, but should be investigated as soon as possible. Plague 10440 Plague, a bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis , is transmitted to humans via flea bites or by direct exposure to infected tissues or respiratory droplets. The disease is characterized by fever, chills, headache, malaise, prostration, and leukocyto sis and can manifest in one or more specific clinical presentations which typically reflect the route of exposure to the pathogen. Clinical evidence: Acute onset of fever as reported by the patient or healthcare provider with or without one or more of the following: regional lymphadenitis, septicemia, pneumonia, or pharyngitis with cervical lymphadenitis.

Isolation of poliovirus type 1, 2, or 3 from a clinical specimen (stool or CSF) Poliovirus infection, nonparalytic 10405 Most poliovirus infections are asymptomatic or cause mild febrile disease. Confirmed: Laboratory confirmed poliovirus infection in a person without symptoms of paralytic poliomyelitis Poliovirus isolate identified in an appropriate clinical specimen, with confirmatory typing and sequencing performed by the CDC Poliovirus Laboratory Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) See Amebic meningoencephalitis as Creutzfeldt 80060 (continued on next page) Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease (CJD) is a human prion disease described as rapidly progressive, neurodegenerative, and invariably fatal. Human prion diseases include sporadic forms of disease (sporadic CJD (sCJD), sporadic fatal insomnia (sFI), and variably (iatrogenic CJD (iCJD), Kuru (d escribed only in the Fore population of Papua New Guinea), and variant CJD (vCJD)). Classical sporadic CJD presentation consists of rapidly progressive dementia, visual abnormalities, myoclonus, or cerebellar dysfunction (where both balance abnormalities and muscle incoordination are seen which commonly present as gait, speech, and swallowing disorders). Most patients eventually develop pyramidal and extrapyramidal dysfunction, such as abnormal reflexes (hyperreflexia), spasticity, tremors, and rigidity. A kinetic mutism appears late in the disease. Median duration of illness is 4 -5 months; the duration of illness rarely exceeds 12 months. For purposes of surveillance and notification: prion diseases such as CJD also includes SFI, Kuru, vCJD, any prion humans. Sporadic CJD (sCJD) * Confirmed: Satisfactory confirmatory test findings on autopsy or biopsy of brain tissue Probable: Neuropsychiatric disorder AND positive RT -QuIC in CSF or other tissues OR Rapidly progressive dementia AND at least two of the following four clinical features: a) Myoclonus b) Visual or cerebellar signs c) Pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs d) Akinetic mutism Confirmatory Laboratory Criteria (brain tissue) - sporadic, familial/genetic & iatrogenic CJD Diagnosis by standard neuropathological techniques AND/OR Immunohistochemistry AND/OR Western blot confirmed protease - resistant PrP AND/OR Presence of scrapie -associated fibrils Supportive Laboratory Criteria - sporadic, familial/genetic & iatrogenic CJD CSF 14 -3-3 protein: Reported as elevated, above normal limits, or positive. If 14 -3-3 protein is the only supportive test used in determining classification, then duration of illness must be < 2 years. CSF RT-QuIC: Positive EEG: Reported as \"typical of\" or \"consistent with\" sporadic CJD or the report indicates the presence of generalized bi - or triphasic \"periodic sharp wave complexes\" (PSWC) at a frequency of 1 -2 per second. N o limitation on duration of illness. Brain MRI: High signal abnormalities in the caudate nucleus and/or putamen OR in at least two cortical regions 60 (continued on next page) AND satisfying at least 1 of the supportive laboratory criteria, AND absence of routine investigations indicating an alternative diagnosis Possible (Suspect) : Progressive dementia AND at least two of the following four clinical features: a) Myoclonus b) Visual or cerebellar signs c) Pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs d) Akinetic mutism AND absence of any supportive laboratory criteria, AND duration of illness < 2 years, AND absence of routine investigations indicating an alternative diagnosis *sCJD includes sporadic fatal insomnia (sFI) and variably protease -weighted imaging (DWI) or fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR). No limitation on duration of illness. Exclusion Criterion: On neurohistopathological analysis of whole brain autopsy tissue, the absence of findings consistent with prion disease (negative results) is sufficient to \"rule out\" possible and probable cases and reclassify as \"Not a Case\". Note: Whole brain autopsy and neuropathology is the only way to confirm or rule -out prion disease. Biopsy tissue can only confirm presence of prion disease but is not sufficient to rule -out prion disease. Aut opsy or postmortem biopsy (when autopsy is not possible) is strongly encouraged, while biopsy on living patients should be reserved for diagnosing treatable diseases. The National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) performs analysis on CSF, blood, and brain tissue. They provide free transport, shipping, and autopsy services for suspected cases of CJD (the family must initiate contact). Physicians are strongly encouraged to confirm the diagnos is of CJD by 61 discussing and arranging autopsy with the NPDPSC and family members. Autopsy is \"highly suggested\" for all cases with onset age less than 55 years or physician diagnosed CJD that does not meet the epidemiologic case criteria. Prion of Confirmed or Probable requires: Confirmed or probable CJD AND confirmed or probable CJD classification in a first degree relative AND/OR Neuropsychiatric disorder AND disease -specific PRNP gene are specific familial/genetic CJD diseases, and classification will be based on pathology results and/or a specific PRNP gene mutation for the disease and family history.

Prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease (CJD) 80060 (continued on next page) Variant CJD (vCJD ) was first described in 1996 in the United Kingdom, and there is strong evidence it is the same agent that was responsible for the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) outbreak in cattle. Variant CJD (vCJD) is characterized by presumed exposure to BSE most commonly through consumption of contaminated meat, a prolonged incubation period of many years or decades, and presence of a Confirmatory Laboratory Criteria (brain tissue) - variant CJD Numerous widespread kuru -type amyloid plaques surrounded by vacuoles in both the cerebellum and cerebrum (i.e., florid plaques) AND 62 (continued on next page) neuropsychiatric disease that is progressive and invariably fatal.

Note: Whole brain autopsy and neuropathology is the only way to confirm or rule -out prion disease. Biopsy tissue can only confirm presence of prion disease but is not sufficient to rule-out prion disease.

Autopsy is \"highly suggested\" for all cases with onset age less than 55 years or physician diagnosed CJD that does not meet the epidemiologic case criteria. Q Fever, acute 10257 Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii . Asymptomatic infection occurs in approximately half of those infected. Exposure to C. burnetii is usually via aerosol, and the source can be unknown (especially for chronic infection). Exposure can be associated with goats, sheep, or other livestock, but direct contact with animals is not required, and variable incubation periods can be dose depend ent. Acute infection, if symptomatic, is characterized by acute onset of fever accompanied by rigors, myalgia, malaise, and severe retrobulbar headache, and can include fatigue, night sweats, dyspnea, confusion, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, non-productive cough, or chest pain. Acute hepatitis, atypical pneumonia, and meningoencephalitis may be present with severe disease. Pregnant women are at risk for fetal death and abortion. Clinical laboratory findings can include Serological evidence of a four - fold change in IgG -specific antibody titer to C. burnetii Phase II antigen by IFA between paired serum samples (preferably one taken during the first week of illness and a second 3 -6 weeks later; phase I titer may be elevated as well) , OR Detection of C. burnetii DNA in a clinical specimen by PCR, OR 64 elevated liver enzyme le vels, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia.

Potentially fatal endocarditis can evolve months to years after acute infection, particularly in persons with underlying val vular disease. Infections of aneurysms and vascular prostheses have been reported. Immunocompromised individuals are particularly susceptible. Rare cases of chronic hepatitis without endocarditis, osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, and pneumonitis have been de scribed. Clinical evidence: Chronic hepatitis, osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, or pneumonitis (in the absence of other known etiology); suspected infection of a vascular aneurysm or vascular prosthesis; or newly recognized, culture -negative endocarditis (pa rticularly in a patient with previous valvulopathy or a compromised immune system). Confirmed: A clinically compatible (meets clinical evidence criteria) case of chronic illness that is laboratory confirmed Probable : A clinically compatible case of chroni c illness with an antibody titer to C. burnetii Phase I IgG antigen that is >1:128 and <1:800 by IFA Serological evidence of IgG antibody to C. burnetii Phase I antigen of >1:800 by IFA (phase II will likely be elevated as well but will generally be lower than phase I) OR Detection of C. burnetii DNA in a clinical specimen by PCR, OR Demonstration of C. burnetii antigen in a clinical specimen by IHC, OR Isolation of C. burnetii from a clinical specimen in cell culture Rabies, animal 10340 All warm -blooded animals, including humans, are susceptible to rabies. In Texas, skunks, bats, coyotes, and foxes are the most commonly infected animals. Domestic dogs, cats, and livestock usually acquire rabies infections from wild animals. Medical authorities distinguish between \"furious\" and \"dumb\" rabies on the basis of clinical signs. In the fu rious variety, the \"mad dog\" symptoms are pronounced. The animal is irritable and will A positive DFA test (preferably performed on central nervous system tissue), OR Isolation of rabies virus (in cell culture or in a laboratory animal) OR 65 snap and bite at real or imaginary objects. It can run for miles and attack anything in its path. The animal is extremely vicious and violent. Paralysis sets in shortly, usually affecting the hind legs first. Death follows four to seven days after the onset of clinical signs. In dumb rabies, the prominent symptoms are drowsiness and paralysis of the lower jaw. The animal can appear to have a bone lodged in its throat, som etimes causing owners to force open an animal's mouth to investigate and become unwittingly exposed to rabies. Animals with dumb rabies have no tendency to roam but will snap at movement. They are completely insensitive to pain, and usually become comatose and die from three to ten days after first symptoms appear. Confirmed: A case that is laboratory confirmed A positive rabies virus direct rapid immunohistochemical test (dRIT) OR A positive rabies virus test by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin -fixed tissue OR A positive pan-lyssavirus probe - based real time reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR test OR Detection of lyssavirus nucleic acid by genomic sequencing Rabies, human 10460 Rabies is an acute encephalomyelitis that almost always progresses to coma or death within 10 days after the first symptom.

Borrelia spirochetes that cause TBRF are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected \"soft ticks\" of the genus Ornithodoros . Each relapsing fever group Borrelia species is usually associated with a specific tick species: B. hermsii is transmitted by O. herm si, B. parkeri by O. parkeri , and B. turicatae by O. turicata ticks. Disease incubation averages one week following a tick bite. Illness is characterized by periods of fever, often exceeding 103oF, lasting 2-7 days, alternating with afebrile periods of 4 -14 days. Febrile periods are often accompanied by shaking chills, sweats, headache, muscle and joint pain, and nausea/vomiting. TBRF may be fatal in 5 -10% of untreated cases. TBRF contracted during pregnancy can cause spontaneous abortion, premature birth, and neonatal death. Clinical evidence: Measured fever >38.8oC (102oF) alone OR one or more episodes of subjective or measured fever <101oF AND two or more of the following: headache, myalgia, nausea/vomiting, or arthralgia. Epidemiologic linkage criteria: Onset of clinically compatible illness 2 -18 days after sharing the same exposure site and time as a confirmed case. Exposure criteria: Exposure is defined as time spent in a county in which Ornithodoros soft ticks are present or where a confirme d autochthonous case of TBRF has been previously reported.

Confirmed: A case of smallpox that is laboratory confirmed, or a case that meets the clinical case definition and is epidemiologically linked to a laboratory confirmed case . Probable: A case that meets the clinical case definition without laboratory confirmation or epidemiological link to a confirmed case, OR a case with an atypical presentation of smallpox (e.g., hemorrhagic type, flat type, and variola sine eruptione) that has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case of smallpox. (Detailed clinical description is available on the CDC web site, see https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/clinicians/clinical -disease.html . Suspect: A case with a generalized, acute vesicular or pustular rash illness with fever preceding development of rash by 1 -4 days Exclusion Criteria : A case can be excluded as a suspect or probable smallpox case if an alternative diagnosis fully explains the illness or appropriate clinical specimens are negative for laboratory criteria for smallpox. Note: The smallpox case definition above is to be used only during post-event surveillance. Pre-event surveillance relies on a highly specific clinical case definition focused on identifying a classic case (ordinary type) of smallpox., In the absence of known smallpox disease, the predictive value of a positive smallpox diagnostic test is extreme ly low, therefore, testing to rule out smallpox should be limited to cases that fit the clinical case definition in order to lower the risk of obtaining a false positive test result. For post -event enhanced surveillance and case reporting guidance see https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/bioterrorism - response -planning/public -health/enhanced -surveillance -case- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identification of variola DNA in a clinical specimen, OR Isolation of smallpox (variola) virus from a clinical specimen (National LRN laboratory only; confirmed by variola PCR) Note: Laboratory diagnostic testing for variola virus should be conducted in a CDC Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratory utilizing LRN -approved PCR tests and protocols for variola virus. Initial confirmation of a smallpox outbreak requires additional testing at CDC. Generic orthopox PCR and negat ive stain electron microscopy (EM) identification of a pox virus in a clinical specimen are suggestive of an orthopox virus infection but not diagnostic for smallpox. 74 reporting.html . Spotted fever rickettsiosis 10250 Spotted fever rickettsioses (SFR) are tick -borne infections caused by some members of the genus Rickettsia . The most well -known SFR is Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), an illness caused by Rickettsia rickettsii . Disease onset for RMSF averages one week following a tick bite. Illness is characterized by acute onset of fever and can be accompanied by headache, malaise, myalgia, nausea/vomiting, or neurologic signs; a macular or maculopapular rash may appear 4 -7 days following onset in many (~80%) patients , often present on the palms and soles. RMSF can be fatal in as many as 20% of untreated cases, and severe fulminant disease can occur. In addition to RMSF, human illness associated with other spotted fever group Rickettsia (SFGR) species, including infect ion with R. parkeri , has also been reported. In these patients, clinical presentation appears similar to, but can be milder than, RMSF; the presence of an eschar at the site of tick attachment has been reported for some other SFR. Clinical evidence: Acute illness lasting less than 30 days with fever and one or more of the following: rash, eschar, headache, myalgia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, or any hepatic transaminase elevation. Confirmed: Clinically compatible case (meets clinical evidence criteria) that i s laboratory confirmed Probable: Clinically compatible case with serological evidence of elevated IgG antibody reactive with SFGR antigen* by IFA (serologic titer of 1:128; specimen collected within 60 days of onset) and the absence of a more likely clini cal explanation Notes: Because antibodies for rickettsial diseases can be cross - reactive, specimens should be tested against a panel* of Rickettsia antigens, including, at a minimum, R. rickettsii and R. typhi , to differentiate between SFGR and non-SFGR species. A case should not be counted as new if the case has ever previously been reported for the same condition. * Specimens can be forwarded to the DSHS Serology lab for rickettsial panel testing.

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome - [outbreaks only] 11700 Streptococcal toxic -shock syndrome (STSS) is a severe illness associated with invasive or noninvasive group A streptococcal (Streptococcus pyogenes ) infection. STSS may occur with infection at any site but most often occurs in association with infection of a cutaneous lesion. Signs of toxicity and a rapidly progressive clinical course are characteristic, and the case fatality rate may exceed 50%. An illness with the following clinical manifestations: 1) Hypotension defined by a systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg for adults or less than the fifth percentile by age for children aged less than 16 years, AND 2) Multi -organ involvement characterized by two or more of the following: Renal Impairment : Creatinine greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL (greater than or equal to 177 \u00b5mol/L) for adults or greater than or equal to twice the upper limit of normal for age.

In patients with preexisting liver disease, a greater than twofold increase over the baseline level. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome : Defined by acute onset of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia in the absence of cardiac failure or by evidence of diffuse capillary leak Isolation of group A Streptococcus (S. pyogenes) (GAS) 76 manifested by acute onset of generalized edema, or pleural or peritoneal effusions with hypo or myositis, or gangrene Confirmed: A case that meets the clinical case definition and is laboratory confirmed with isolation of g roup A Streptococcus from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood or cerebrospinal fluid or, less commonly, joint, pleural, or pericardial fluid) Probable : A case that meets the clinical case definition in the absence of another identified etiology for the il lness and with isolation of group A Streptococcus from a non -sterile site Note: Enter all confirmed and probable STSS cases as confirmed group A Streptococcus 11717 was used prior to 2010 and for 2010 there are cases under both codes. Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria cause many clinical syndromes, depending on the site of infection (e.g., acute otitis media, pneumonia, bacteremia, or meningitis). Only invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae is reportable. Confirmed : A case that is laboratory confirmed Probable : A case with detection of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site using a culture independent diagnostic test (CIDT) (e.g., PCR, antigen -based tests) without isolation of the bacteria Note: Positive lab results from a specimen collected more than 30 days after the collection date of a prior case should be counted as a new case. If specimen collection occurred within 30 days of the collection date of a prior case, it should not be counted as a new case. Isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood or cerebrospinal fluid, or, less commonly, joint, pleural, or pericardial fluid) See Normally Sterile Site and Streptococcus Classification Note: Serotyping of isolates can be performed at the DSHS laboratory. Serotyping is required by TAC for invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae cases on all isolates from children under 5 years old. Taenia sol ium and undifferentiated Taenia infection 80680 Taeniasis is an intestinal infection with the adult stage of the pork ( T. solium ) or beef ( T. saginata ) tapeworm. Clinical manifestations of infection with the adult worm, if present, are variable and can include nervousness, insomnia, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, and digestive disturbances; many infections are asymptomatic. Taeniasis is usually a nonfatal Infection with an adult tapeworm is diagnosed by identification of p roglottids (segments), eggs, or antigens of the worm in the feces or on anal swabs 77 infection, but the larval stage of T. solium can cause fatal cysticercosis. Confirmed: Laboratory identification of the presence of T. solium proglottids, eggs, or antigens in a clinical specimen Probable: Laboratory identification of the presence of undifferentiated Taenia spp. tapeworm proglottids or eggs in a clinical specimen See Cysticercosis Note: Eggs of T. solium and T. saginata cannot be differentiated morphologically. Specific diagnosis is based on the morphology of the scolex (head) and/or gravid proglotti ds.

Confirmed: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed in the patient Probable: A clinically compatible illness in a person who shared an epidemiologically implicated meal or ate an epidemiologically implicated meat product, OR a clinically compatible illness in a person who consumed a meat product in which the parasite was demonstra ted Suspect : A person without clinically compatible illness who shared an implicated meal or ate an implicated meat product, has no known prior history of Trichinella infection, and has a positive serologic test for trichinellosis Notes: Epidemiologicall y implicated meals or meat products are defined as a meal/meat product that was consumed by a person who subsequently developed a clinically compatible illness that was laboratory confirmed. Demonstration of Trichinella spp. larvae in tissue obtained by muscle biopsy, OR Positive serologic test for Trichinella spp. 78 Subsequent cases of trichinellosis experienced by one individual should only be counted if there is a clinically - compatible illness AND a compatible exposure. Trichuriasis 80790 A parasitic infection Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) . People with light infections are usually asymptomatic. Cases with heavy infections may experience frequent, painful passage of stool that contains a mixture of mucus, water, and blood. Rectal prolapse can also occur. Heavy infections in children can lead to severe anemia, delayed physical growth and impaired cognitive development. Confirmed: A case that is laboratory confirmed Microscopic identification of Trichuris eggs or worms in feces, OR Observation during sigmoidoscopy, proctoscopy, or colonoscopy of Trichuris worms characterized by a threadlike form with an attenuated, whip - like end, OR Identification of Trichuris worms on prolapsed rectal mucosa Tularemia 10230 The signs and symptoms of tularemia vary depending on how the bacteria enter the body. Illness ranges from mild to life - threatening. All forms are accompanied by fever, which can be as high as 104\u00b0F. Clinical diagnosis is supported by evidence or history o f a tick or deerfly bite, exposure to tissues of a mammalian host of Francisella tularensis , or exposure to potentially contaminated water. Illness is characterized by several distinct forms, including the following: Ulceroglandular: cutaneous ulcer pleuropulmon ary disease Typhoidal: febrile illness without early localizing signs and symptoms Confirmed: A clinically compatible case with confirmatory laboratory results Probable : A clinically compatible case with laboratory results Isolation of F. tularensis in a clinical or autopsy speci men, OR Four-fold or greater rise in serum antibody titer* to F. tularensis antigen between acute and convalescent specimens.

Some commercial labs perform reflex titer testing for ELISA - positive specimens; contact the commercial lab for these results. Samples that are ELISA -positive with no reflex testing should be forwarde d to DSHS for Francisella tularensis serology at CDC. IFA testing at commercial labs can be unreliable and results should be interpreted with caution if samples cannot be forwarded for validation. Typhus, flea -borne (endemic, murine) 10260 Flea-borne typhus is a rickettsial disease whose course resembles that of louse -borne typhus, but is generally milder. The onset is variable, often sudden and marked by headache, chills, fatigue, fever, and ge neral body aches. A macular rash may appear on the 5th or 6th day, initially on the upper trunk, followed by spread to the entire body, but usually not to the face, palms or soles. Absence of louse infestation, geographic and seasonal distribution, and spo radic occurrence of the disease help to differentiate it from louse-borne typhus. Clinical evidence : Acute illness lasting less than 30 days with fever and two or more of the following: headache, myalgia, rash, nausea/vomiting, thrombocytopenia, or any el evated liver enzyme Confirmed : Clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed Probable : Clinically compatible case with evidence of epidemiologic linkage*, the absence of a more likely clinical explanation, and supportive lab evidence: Serological evidence of a four - fold increase in IgG -specific antibody titer reactive with R. typhi by IFA test between paired serum specimens (preferably one taken in the first two weeks of illness and a second up to ten weeks later), OR Detection of R. typhi nucleic acid via amplification of R. typhi target by rt -PCR assay OR Demonstration of typhus fever group antigen in a biopsy or autopsy specimen by IHC, OR Isolation of R. typhi from a clinical specimen in cell culture and molecular confirmation (e.g., 80 Serologic evidence of elevated IgG at a titer of 1:128 reactive with R. typhi antigen by IFA in a sample taken within 60 days of illness onset, OR Serologic evidence of elevated IgM at a titer of 1:256 reactive with R. typhi antigen by IFA in a sample taken within 60 days of illness onset. *Epidemiologic linkage criteria: Was in same household or had same defined exposure as a confirmed case within the past 14 days before onset of symptoms, OR likely vector exposure in an area with suitable seaso nal and ecological conditions for potential local vector -borne transmission Notes: Because antibodies for rickettsial diseases can be cross - reactive, specimens should be tested against a panel** of Rickettsia antigens, including, at a minimum, R. rickettsii and R. typhi, to differentiate between SFG and non -SFG Rickettsia spp. According to CDC, rickettsial IgM tests lack specificity (resulting in false positives); thus, IgG titers are much more reliable. A case should not be counted as new if the case has ever previously been reported for the same condition. **Specimens can be forwarded to the DSHS Serology Laboratory for rickettsial panel testing. See Rickettsia Classification PCR or sequence) Note: DNA -detection methods outside of PCR (e.g. cell -free DNA) does not meet lab criteria. Samples can be forwarded for additional testing at the DSHS lab or CDC. Typhus fever (epidemic, louse - borne) 10265 A rickettsial disease caused by Rickettsia prowazekii and transmitted by the human body louse. The illness may have a variable onset which is often sudden and marked by headache, chills, prostration, fever, and general body aches. A macular rash may appear on the 5th or 6th day, initially on the upper trunk, followed by spread to the entire body, but usually not to the face, palms or soles. The rash is often difficult to observe on dark skin. Toxemia is usually pronounced, and the disease terminates by rapid defervescence after about 2 weeks of fever. Confirmed : Clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed Four-fold or greater rise in IgG - specific antibody titer to R. prowazekii antigen by IFA test in acute and convalescent specimens ideally taken at least 2 weeks apart, OR Positive PCR assay to R. prowazekii, OR Demonstration of positive R. prowazekii IHC of skin lesion 81 Probable : Clinically compatible case with supportive laboratory results and the absence of a more likely clinical explanation: IFA serologic titer of 1:128 Note: The IFA test is most commonly used for laboratory confirmation, but it does not discriminate between louse -borne and flea -borne typhus unless the sera are differentially absorbed with the respective rickettsial antigen prior to testing. See Rickettsia Classification (biopsy) or organ tissue (autopsy) Vancomycin - intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA ) 11663 Staphylococcus aureus can produce a variety of syndromes with clinical manifestations including skin and soft tissue lesions, empyema, pyarthrosis, bloodstream infection, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, sepsis, and meningitis. Confirmed: A vancomycin -intermediate Staphylococcus aureus from any body site that is laboratory confirmed. (MIC: 4 -8 \u00b5g/ml) Note: The DSHS Laboratory uses the Etest for confirmation of resistance. Etest generates MIC values from a continuous scale and can give resu lts in-between conventional two -fold dilutions. According to manufacturer's protocol, a value which falls between standard two -fold dilutions is rounded up to the next upper two -fold value before categorization so that a MIC of 3\u00b5g/ml is reported as interm ediate resistance.

Vibriosis (non - cholera Vibrio species infections) 11541 Vibriosis is caused by infection with pathogenic species of the family Vibrionaceae (species other than toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 cause cholera). These pathogens typically cause gastrointestinal illness with watery diarrhea and vomiting, primary septicemia, or wound infections. Asymptomatic infections can occur, and the organism can cause extraintestinal infections. Confirmed: A case that is laboratory confirmed Probable : A case with a species of the family Vibrionaceae (other than toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 or O139) detected, in a clinical specimen, by use of culture independent laboratory methods (non-culture based, CIDT), OR A clinically compatible case that is epidemi ologically linked to a case that meets the probable or confirmed laboratory criteria for diagnosis Note: The CDC has merged Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, and Vibriosis, other or unspecified into a single reportable disease, rather than splitt ing them into 3 distinct categories. A case should not be counted as a new case if laboratory results were reported within 30 days of a previously reported infection in the same individual, unless additional information is available indicating a separate infection, e.g., different species .

Yellow fever is preventable by a safe and effective vaccine. Most yellow fever virus infections are asymptomatic. Following an incubation period of 3 -9 days, approximately one -third of infected people develop symptomatic illness characterized by fever and headache. Other clinical findings include chills, vomiting, myalgia, lumbosacral pain, and bradycardia relative to elevated bod y temperature. An estimated 5% -25% of patients progress to more severe disease, including jaundice, renal insufficiency, cardiovascular instability, or ecchymoses). The -fatalit y rate for severe yellow fever is 30%-60%. Clinical criteria : An acute illness with at least one of the following: fever, jaundice, or elevated total bilirubin 3 mg/dl, and the absence of a more likely clinical explanation.

Yersiniosis 11565 An illness characterized by acute diarrhea (may be bloody) with abdominal pain. Other symptoms include acute mesenteric lymphadenitis mimicking appendicitis, exudative pharyngitis, and systemic infection. Note: -intestinal manifestations may also be present, such as abscess, which could be a source for testing, and reactive arthritis and erythema nodosum, which are often immunologic phenomena not directly caused by the infection. These manifestations are not required as part of the clinical criteria. Confirmed: A case that is laboratory confirmed Probable: A clinically compatible case that is epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case, or a clinically c ompatible case identified through use of a culture independent diagnostic test (CIDT) such as PCR.
