It is also a quality that is not easy to either attain or maintain in today's world. We may travel miles in the quest for happiness and well being and spend lots of money, but we may not get what we want. Yet the source of this quality is not really somewhere outside, but within our own selves. It is a quality that we carry with us, but which we are often not aware of. Our state of well being is our real home. And even if we are rich and have a healthy body, we only feel really good when we are happy and when our mind is at peace. It is scientifically proved, that a positive and peaceful inner disposition improves our immune system and makes us more resistant to viruses and also lowers the risk of attaining various other serious illnesses, like cancer or heart diseases etc. It is scientifically proved, that a positive and peaceful inner disposition improves our immune system and makes us more resistant to viruses and also lowers the risk of attaining various other serious illnesses, like cancer or heart diseases etc. The Luminous Energy Field We all have an energy body that acts as an interface between the healing forces of Nature and our physical mind/body. Our energy body, or Lightbody, is a living holographic energy field that contains a library of information about who we are and what we have experienced. Everything that has happened in our lifetimes is imprinted into it, as are the blueprints for the entire genetic, psychological and cultural health we inherited from our ancestors. When these imprints get activated our energy body gets bogged down with heavy energies that prevent a clear interface with the forces of Nature, preventing us from being able to heal. Our Luminous Energy Field has existed since before the beginning of time. It was one with the unmanifested light of Creation, and it will endure throughout infinity. It dwells outside of time but manifests in time by creating new physical bodies lifetime after lifetime. Imagine you are enveloped in a translucent, multicolored orb pulsing with blues, greens, magentas, and yellows, enfolding you to the width of your outstretched arms. Just above your skin, streams of golden light shimmer and flow through the acupuncture meridians. Between your skin and the membrane of the Luminous Energy Field swirl resplendent currents that fuse into whirlpools of light. This reservoir of vital force is a sea of living energy as indispensable to our health as the oxygen and nutrients carried by the bloodstream. They are the energies of the Luminous Energy Field, the purest and most precious fuel for life. When the vital reserves in the Luminous Energy Field are depleted through illness, environmental pollutants, or stress, we suffer disease. We can ensure our health and vitality and extend our active, healthy years by replenishing this essential fuel. Every living thing on Earth is composed of light. Plants absorb light directly from the sun and turn it into life, and animals eat green plants that feed on light, so that light is the fundamental building block of life. We are light bound into living matter. Every living thing around us is made of light, bound and packaged in different forms and vibration. Physicists studying subatomic particles know that when you look deeply enough into the heart of matter, you find the entire universe is made up of vibration and light. Like the physical body, the energy or Lightbody also has anatomical structures recognized by many cultures worldwide, cultures working independently of each other for thousands of years. These organs are the chakras and the meridian system known from Acupunture. They bring in vitality or Chi, as the Chinese call it, or Prana, as the Vedics call it, to the glands and organs of the body. They also dispel the heavy energies we collect due to emotions and toxic environments. Energy Medicine is the removal of heavy energies and blocks that prevent these organs from working properly. There are many different ways to remove these energy blocks. Reiki is a Japanese method designed to clear the chakras and Shamanic Healing is the way Native Americans have been addressing clearing not only the chakras and the meridians but also removing the personal, ancestral and cultural imprints from the Lightbody that prevent our systems from doing their jobs effectively. The Luminous Energy Field contains an archive of all of our personal and ancestral memories, of all early-life trauma, and even of painful wounds from former lifetimes. These records or imprints are stored in full color and intensity of emotion. Imprints are like dormant computer programs that when activated compel us toward behaviors, relationships, accidents, and illnesses that parody the initial wounding. Our personal history indeed repeats itself. Imprints of physical trauma are stored in the outermost layer of the Luminous Energy Field. Emotional imprints are stored in the second layer, soul imprints in the third, and spiritual imprints in the fourth and deepest layer. Imprints in the Luminous Energy Field predispose us to follow certain pathways in life. They orchestrate the incidents, experiences, and people we attract to ourselves. Imprints propel us to re-create painful dramas and heartbreaking encounters, yet ultimately guide us toward situations wherein we can heal our ancient soul wounds. The Luminous Energy Field contains a template of how we live, how we age, how we heal, and how we might die. When there is no imprint for disease in the Luminous Energy Field, recovery from an illness happens at tremendous speed. By the same token, imprints for diseases can depress the immune system, and it can take an extremely long time for us to regain our health during an illness. None of us wants to spend months convalescing when we could have recovered in a matter of days or weeks. When we erase the negative imprint that caused the onset of illness, the immune system can rapidly eradicate the disease. In the outermost layer of the Luminous Energy Field is the membrane or \"skin\" of the luminous body. This membrane serves as a defensive cocoon in the same way the skin is the protective membrane of the body. The imprints of physical trauma and disease are etched onto this membrane like designs cut into glass. Imagine you are enveloped in a translucent, multicolored orb pulsing with blues, greens, magentas, and yellows, enfolding you to the width of your outstretched arms.

Imprints of the Luminous Energy Field Imprints are formed when the negative emotions that accompany trauma are not healed. Imprints in the Luminous Energy Field can arrange strange and apparently unrelated events in the outside world. They can orchestrate our meeting love partners who all have the same toxic personality traits. They can strand us in the oddest places to come upon someone we are destined to meet; they can program us to be in the vehicle hit by oncoming traffic or in the one that just missed the accident. The healer is interested in draining the toxic emotional energy around an imprint and then erasing the imprint itself. The first stages of the Healing the Light Body training consists of a deep clearing or \"scouring\" of our Luminous Energy Field. The student no longer identifies with her personal history. Healers may have suffered loss, hunger, pain, and abuse, but they understand that above all they are travelers on a great journey through infinity.

This is the goal of healing through the [Illumination Process](/the-illumination-process.html). I am not very interested in working within my client's stories, the way the psychotherapist is. I am interested in assisting clients to realize that they are not their stories, not actors in a script written by their mother or father or by the culture or time they happen to be living in, but storytellers. To do this I have to access the underlying imprint in the Luminous Energy Field. Healing and Curing Sometimes \"healing\" helps to bring about a \"cure\". Sometimes it does not. In our Western culture, curing often occurs - through drug therapy, surgery, chemotherapy or other methods - but if there is no healing done along with the curing, frequently the disease will come back because the message the disease has had for us has not been integrated or because our body's energetic affinity for that disease is still in place. Healing means \"to make whole.\" When we heal or become whole, we come into a place of integrating the wisdom of an event or an obstacle, a disease or a relationship. And a lovely side effect of that healing can sometimes be a physical cure. The healing process begins at the spiritual level. From there it travels \"downward\" to the other levels of being. This means that sometimes energy will reach the physical instantly and bring about change, but other times energy will be needed on a subtle level first (such as the mental level), and change will be seen more slowly on the physical level. These things depend on the cause (or causes) of the condition, the soul's journey, and the state of cause and effect. When souls decide to address imbalances created in the present life or in past lives, the factors of this law will influence the energetic situation.
