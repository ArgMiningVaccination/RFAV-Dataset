By early 2021, 3 adenovirus-vector vaccine agents, 2mRNA vaccine agents, and 2 inactivated viral vaccine agents completed phase 2/3 trials and were approved for emergency use in multiple countries. 4Through the middle of April 2021, greater than 878,900,000 doses of these vaccines have been administered globally.5These vaccines have an ef cacy from 62% to in reducing severe/critical in- fections. 6,7Data have also shown that vaccination can reduce hospitalization. Adverse events were reported in all of the vaccinetrials, including hypersensitivity reactions, but no fatalities due tohypersensitivity reactions were reported. During the phase 3 studies for the currently approved vaccines, there was no sig- nicant difference in hypersensitivity rates between vaccine and placebo trial arms, with 0 to 1 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses reported. 7-11 On December 9, 2020, there were 2 severe allergic reactions reported after administration of the rst 500 P zer- BioNTech vaccinations in the United Kingdom; both patients responded to treatment with intramuscular epinephrine.12In response, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Reg-ulatory Agency (MHRA) temporarily recommended a contraindication for the P zer-BioNTech vaccine in in- dividuals with a history of a severe allergic reaction to anyvaccine, medication, or food. 13This recommendation was modi ed in early January 2021 to a contraindication only for those with a history of a severe allergic reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine or vaccine component/excipient (polyethylene glycol [PEG] vaccines, and poly- sorbate 80, a related excipient contained in the adenovirusvaccines, which is considered po tentially cross-reactive with PEG). 8,9,14-18Similar contraindications have been adopted in multiple other countries by public health regulatory agenciesand allergy/immunology societies as detailed in Figure 1 . 4,19-21 The evidence base for many of these recommendations re- mains uncertain, however. A handful of publications have detailed potentially allergic reactions to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, through the early stages of their emergency use authorization (EUA). These re- ports provide the speci c reported symptoms, treatment, co- morbid allergic history, and discussion of the con dence that the reaction constituted anaphylaxis as adjudicated by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) physicians.This was based on adjudication of the data reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reaction System (VAERS) using the Brighton Collaboration criteria (BCC) for vaccine anaphy-laxis. 22-24The CDC has continued to periodically update these estimates based on VAERS data.25,26Through the rst month after the U.S. EUA for both mRNA vaccines, the CDC described 66 anaphylaxis events in 17,524,676 vaccinations, orapproximately 3.7 events per million. 25,26One large U.S. ac- ademic medical center reported 16 cases of anaphylaxis among 64,900 vaccinations (250 cases per million vaccinations) over a2-month period, based on electronic health record review (by allergy investigators) of reported symptoms within 3 days of vaccination. 27These reports all indicate that anaphylactic reactions to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines may occur butare rare.Reports of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have prompted concern that the new mRNA vaccine platform has the potential to cause allergic reactions (including anaphy- laxis) at a greater rate than other vaccines. A lesser degree ofconcern is shared for adenovirus-vector vaccines because there is more experience with this platform. These concerns likely contribute to vaccine hesitancy and must be weighed against thelife-saving and disease-mitigating bene ts of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Given the lack of an established international evidence-based approach to reactions attributable to these vac-cines, this group of international experts in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis has organized an evidence-based, consensus guidance for the diagnosis and management of se-vere allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to SARS-CoV-2vaccines. METHODS Anad hoc panel of clinical experts from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Russia, Europe (Ireland, Germany, Italy), South Africa, and Australia came together to synthesize the currentevidence regarding severe allergic reactions to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and to provide consensus recommendations regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, assessment, and management of patientsat possible risk for a severe allergic reaction to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine from a societal perspective. The panel was chosen based on expertise in anaphylaxis diagnosis, management, and policy. The groupincluded representation of infectious disease clinicians, cliniciansserving as front-line vaccinators, and allergy specialists with prior expertise in policy related to adverse reactions to vaccines for in- fectious diseases. Direct nancial and industry-related con flicts of interest (eg, direct or indirect involvement with the development or clinical trials related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines) were not permitted and were considered disqualifying. Work unrelated to vaccinedevelopment with companies (eg, asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis) was not considered either a direct or an indirect con flict, but such involvement was disclosed. The development of thisguidance did not include any industry input, funding, or nancial or nonnancial contribution. No member of the guidance panel received honoraria or remuneration for any role in the guidancedevelopment process. A primary draft, inclusive of 4 focused questions, was iteratively developed by the senior authors (M.G., M.S., D.K.) using the Grading Assessment,Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) format for evidence syn- thesis from an individual perspective with secondary consideration for the health care perspective. This draft was circulated and revised/edited iteratively over multiple draft versions by the workgroup. A modi ed Delphi panel among the members was used to rate agreement and consensus with the nal recommendations. 28The GRADE methodology is explained in detail elsewhere,29-31and the full details of the methods for this analysis are detailed in the Appendix E1 (available in this article 's Online Repository at www. jaci-inpractice.org ). An electronic REDCap survey (Research Elec- tronic Data Capture, Nashville, TN) was sent to panel members who were asked to rate their level of agreement with recommenda- tions (1 \u00bcstrongly disagree, 2 \u00bcdisagree, 3 \u00bcneutral, 4 \u00bcagree, 5\u00bcstrongly agree).32In addition, panel members were encouraged to submit free text comments for statements, and could choose \"not applicable \"if they did not feel they had the expertise to answer a question. A priori consensus was de ned as agreement of greater thanJ ALLERGY CLIN and \"strongly agree \"and\"agree \"were grouped together. For recommendations in which consensus was not ach-ieved after the initial survey, an iterative discussion was undertaken with the intent to resolve the key points and adjust language. Sub- sequent surveys were then sent to panel members incorporating thedeidenti ed responses from the prior survey with the goal of reaching consensus. This process was repeated until consensus was reached or, if no consensus was achieved by the third round, thestatement was categorized as \"no consensus reached. \" Outcomes prioritized in this systematic review and meta-analysis were anaphylaxis to the vaccine and vaccine excipients, as well as thediagnostic accuracy of allergy testing to the vaccine and vaccineexcipients. The literature searched included (1) global coronavirus databases for country by country vaccine allergy or anaphylaxis reporting (2) national passive vaccine safety reporting systems, and(3) PubMed/Medline and clinical trials registries related to SARS- CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials and published case series related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine adverse events. Systematic reviews and litera-ture searches (supplement) were conducted by 5 authors A.W.-B., A.B.) using Covidence (Cochrane Searches and manuscript selections are detailed inthe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagrams in Figure E1 (available at www.jaci-inpractice.org ). Speci c inclu- sion and exclusion criteria for each search are detailed in theEMethods. We considered but did not rely on indirect evidence from similar event reporting from other vaccines, given differences in the context and technology of the vaccines. However, we consideredindirect evidence for management strategies of those with vaccine allergy because this comprises the extant literature regarding vaccine allergy, and the acute management of severe allergic reactions,including anaphylaxis, to vaccines is suf ciently similar to the experience with diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis to foods, drugs, and insect stings. We used the European CommissionGuidance for Industry of Adverse Drug Reactions threshold for what was considered a rare event as between 1 case/1,000 to 10,000 in- dividuals, and very rare as less than 1 case/10,000 individuals. 33 Although not systematically reviewed, we examined vaccine ef - cacy as an outcome because this was identi ed as being of major importance to patients. We use the wording \"we recommend \"for strong recommenda- tions and \"we suggest \"for conditional recommendations. The im- plications of the recommendation strength are presented in Table E1 (available in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice. org), the certainty of evidence in Table E2 (available in this arti- cle's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org ), and the risk of bias assessment in Figures E2 to E4 (available in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org ). The nal list of recom- mendations was developed by panel discussion and consensus. We present the guideline statements and recommendations in Table I .

Therefore, wesuggest against prolonged observation in thosewith a history of severe allergic reactions unrelated to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or excipient.Conditional Low In patients without a history of anaphylaxis to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or its excipients,should allergy skin testing to SARS-CoV-2vaccines or its excipients be performed?In patients with no history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, toSARS-CoV-2 vaccines or its excipients, werecommend against vaccine or vaccine excipient testing prior to vaccination in an attempt to predict the rare individual who will have asevere allergic reaction to vaccination.Strong Low In patients with a history of anaphylaxis to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or its excipients, should allergy skin testing to SARS-CoV-2vaccines or its excipients be performed todetermine whether vaccine withholding is needed?We suggest against the clinician routinely performing skin or in vitro testing using SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or excipients outside ofthe research setting for the purpose of vaccinewithholding, given such testing has unknown sensitivity/speci city in predicting severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, toSARS-CoV-2 vaccines.Conditional Low Should SARS-CoV-2 mRNA or adenovirus- vector vaccines be administered to anindividual who had an immediate allergic reaction to the rst dose of the vaccine (dened as a generalized, systemic allergic reaction with acute onset occurring within 4hours of vaccine administration) or given as arst dose to an individual who is suspected to have reacted previously to an excipientingredient that is also present in theSARS-CoV-2 mRNA or adenovirus-vector vaccines?We recommend a shared decision-making paradigm of care favoring vaccination throughfull or graded dosing (with or without additional observation time postvaccination) or changing vaccine platforms to another agent over novaccination because there is no single bestapproach to assessment and management of the patient with a suspected SARS-CoV-2 mRNA or adenovirus-vector vaccine reaction or thepatient with an allergy to an excipient in eitherof these vaccines who has not yet been vaccinated.Strong Moderate In patients with a suspected immediate allergic reaction to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine whosestandard schedule requires more than 1 dose, we recommend referral to an allergist for assessment of additional vaccination over novaccination/vaccination being withheld. In resource-limited settings in which specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives maybe presented in a shared decision-makingcontext to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, use of alternative vaccine products, or delay invaccination until a solution can be determined.Strong Moderate IMMUNOL RecommendationRecommendation trengthEvidence ertainty In patients with a suspected or con rmed but remote past medical history of reaction to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine excipient, we recommend referral to an allergist for assessment ofadditional vaccination over no vaccination/ vaccination being withheld.

RESULTS Part 1: Recommendations for individuals before theirinitial SARS-CoV-2 vaccination who do not have ahistory of a severe allergic reaction, includinganaphylaxis, to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or itsexcipients Question 1. What is the risk of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a patientwith no history of a severe allergic reaction to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or its excipients? Recommendation 1For patients with no history of a previous severe allergic re- action to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or its excipients, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine einduced anaphylaxis is very rare and we recommend vaccination over no vaccination based on this risk. Strong recommendation; high certainty of evidence Recommendation 2For patients with a history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, unrelated to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or excipient, the requirement for additional observation beyondstandard wait time (eg, recommended by local health authoritiesfor the general population) provides a minimal absolute risk reduction in severe allergic reaction outcomes and may also contribute to vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, we suggest againstprolonged observation in those with a history of severe allergic reactions unrelated to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or excipient. Conditional recommendation; low certainty of evidenceRationale Systematic review and meta-analysis We searched the World Heal th Organization (WHO) Global Coronavirus database, the COVID vaccine random- ized controlled trial living evidence map, government Web- sites, medical literature, and press releases for all estimates ofanaphylaxis induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines up to March19, 2021, identifying 46 total reports meeting inclusion criteria (see EMethods). 10,26,27,34-72We performed a random effects meta-analysis of proportions using hierarchical logisticregression and Clopper-Pearson con dence intervals (CIs). Among 26 reports involving reported cases adjudicated to meet BCC for anaphylaxis with a sample size of at least20,000 doses, the meta-analyzed incidence of anaphylaxis was 7.91 per million (95% con dence interval [95% CI 4.02- 15.59), and no anaphylaxis-related fatalities were reported. Inmultivariable meta-regression, we found that reports ofanaphylaxis without adjudication were associated with a higher reported rate of anaphylaxis (odds ratio [OR] 5.53; 95% CI 4.01-7.61), and compared with mRNA-based vac-cines, lower rates of anaphylaxi s were associated with vaccines using adenoviral vectors (O R 0.47; 95% CI 0.33-0.68) and inactivated virus (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.18-0.53). Findings were similar when analyzing all 46 reports (eg, regardless of sample size) ( Figure 2 ).Table E2 details the certainty of evidence for this estimate, and Figure E2 the risk of bias assessment.Discussion Vaccine-related fatalities from severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are very rare. Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are historically cited at about 1.3 events per milliondoses. 73,74A 2019 study by Su et al75using the VAERS noted a cumulative incidence rate of 17 cases of anaphylaxis per million vaccinations from 1990 to 2016. By comparison, the publishedrate for anaphylaxis to penicillin is 5 to 10 cases per million persons, 76and in the general population, drug allergy fatalities occur on the order of 0.1 to 1 event per million persons.77 Moreover, the estimated fatality rate from SARS-CoV-2 viral infection as of early March 2021 ranges from 36.4 to 1,852.7 per 1,000,000 persons in countries represented by authors on thisconsensus document. 2Data from a physician-reported national Canadian vaccine registry showed a rate of allergic reactions of any severity to vaccines of approximately 370 reactions per million doses, with most being attributable to in fluenza vac- cines.78Slightly older data have noted the estimated rate of allergic reactions of any severity (including anaphylaxis) ranges between 1 and 20 per million persons.77Because SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are novel, historical estimates of severe re- actions to these agents are not available. Although fatality attributed to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has occurred, none has beenthe result of a severe allergic reaction. 79 Comparing reported rates of anaphylaxis following vaccination is hampered by variation in anaphylaxis de nitions across regions and between organizations, as shown in Table E4 (available in this arti- cle's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org ). This causes re- actions considered to be anaphylaxis by some de nitions to not be considered anaphylaxis by other de nitions. For example, although the BCC are the accepted standard for anaphylaxis from vaccines and a r eu s e db yV A E R S ,24some of the cases in the Morbidity and Mor- tality Weekly Reports would not meet other international diagnostic c r i t e r i a ,s u c ha se i t h e rt h eN a t i o n a lI n s t i t u t e so fA l l e r g ya n dI n f e c - tious Diseases (NIAID) criteria or those from the World Allergy Organization (WAO).80-83Table II demonstrates how the cases published in the medical literature by the CDC could be rateddifferently based on what classi cation system for anaphylaxis was used. 84One study has compared the NIAID criteria and BCC, noting agreement of the criteria on 92 of 128 cases (72%), whichbased on a kappa statistic of 0.414, is at the lower limit of what is considered statistical \"moderate \"agreement. 85 Importantly, VAERS is a passive case reporting system that allows the public, manufacturers, and health care workers to report signs and symptoms considered to be adverse events occurring around vaccine administration. The VAERS and othersimilar reporting systems in other countries (eg, Yellow Card Reporting in the United Kingdom) are not designed to deter- mine causality or validity of the event in question. Such reportingmakes it dif cult to de nitively discern objective versus subjec- tive symptoms, making it impossible to exclude other common causes that can mimic symptoms of an acute allergic reaction. Thus, based on evidence to date, whereas severe allergic re-actions, including anaphylaxis, may occur with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, this is a rare event and represents a very low (but not completely absent) risk according to pooled adjudicateddata. 25In formulating recommendations 1 and 2, we weighed the potential bene ts and harms of vaccination against each other, along with consideration of patient values, preferences,and cost. Whereas we acknowledge that well-informed in-dividuals may have values and preferences that could lead ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT MONTH 20218 GREENHAWT ET ALvaccine refusal in spite of very high certainty of evidence regarding the rarity of severe allergic reactions to these vaccines, it was felt that most informed individuals would be highly likely tochoose vaccination over vaccine refusal based on the very rare riskof a severe allergic reaction and the bene t of vaccination in this situation. Risk-strati cation based on allergic history In the phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for the currently approved vaccines, participants were excluded from participation if they had a known or suspected allergy or history of anaphylaxis, ur-ticaria, or other signi cant adverse reaction to the vaccine or its excipients, including PEG and polysorbate 80, but not for any other baseline allergic or atopic condition. 4,8-11 ,48,69,71,86Of note, a high percentage of individuals reporting severe allergicreactions to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in the CDC re- ports also had a self-reported history of an underlying allergic condition including past medication and unrelated vaccine al-lergy, and were female; however, the signi cance and validity ofthese allergy diagnoses or male/female differences are dif cult to assess whether these signify a risk signal or not. 22,23,87Allergic conditions are very common in the general population and self-reported allergy is typically much higher than con rmed allergy. As well, the rate of individuals with similar allergic comorbidity who successfully tolerated their vaccine has not been calculated, and this is needed to properly quantify a risk ratio related to ageneral or speci c type of allergic history (or sex). Mechanisti- cally, it is unclear why allergies to food, venom, or other non- ePEG/mRNA-containing vaccines/medications would pose any hazard requiring additional postvaccination observation or contraindication to vaccine administration. Therefore, pending emergence of additional data showing there is a clearly increasedrisk relative to a control population, allergic or atopic comor-bidity should not be considered a risk greater than the general population for a vaccine-associated allergic reaction, and inclusion of these precautions risks harm in promoting vaccinehesitancy. 14,18,88An ongoing study is exploring risks ofNot clearly adjudicated Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre UK MHRA Danish Medicines Agency Australian Health Department Institute of Public Health of ChileHealth Ministry, MexicoMinister of State for Health, Singapore Health minister, Poland Health Ministry, Israel Minister, JapanNorwegian Medicines AgencyNetherlands Pharmacovigilance CentreSwissmedic and EOC reference centre UK MHRA Institute of Public Health of Chile Danish Medicines AgencySummary Adjudicated Union health Ministry, India UK MHRA Danish Medicines Agency Australian Health Department Institute of Public Health of Chile NCT04505722, multinational NCT04530396, Russia CDC, USA MGB (Boston), USAPHAC, CanadaNCT04470427, USANCT04368728, multinationalUK MHRA Institute of Public Health of Chile Danish Medicines Agency Summary Test for interaction, P 54 5 32117 8 12 8 130 1163 2 5 51 12 0 1 66 1650 1 0 18 3.69) 33.41 (10.85 - 77.96) (95% CI) 0100 500 1,000 Incidence per million doses FIGURE 2.

Shaker et al89modeled the cost effectiveness of applying broad restrictions based on underlying allergic history in the UnitedStates, and the impact of extended wait time as a precaution. Using Markov modeling and microsimulation, universal vacci- nation was associated with a cost savings of $503,596,316 andsaved 7,607 lives versus a risk-strati ed approach until vaccine- associated anaphylaxis rates were less than 0.8%. Strati ed postvaccination extended observation time (comparing a stan- dard of 15 minutes recommended by the CDC for the generalpopulation vs 30 minutes for persons considered potentially at risk for a vaccine-associated allergic reaction) by anaphylaxis history was not cost effective without greater than 1% anaphy-laxis case-fatality and less than 6% risk of Furthermore, withholding of a second mRNA vac- cine dose after a rst reaction was not cost effective unless rst- dose protection was very high (meaning there was limited value of additional doses) and risk for vaccine-associated anaphylaxis with an additional dose was high 90,91(Figure E5 andTable E5 ; available in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci- inpractice.org ). Emerging data from a real-world U.S. study of both mRNA vaccines in 3,950 recipients noted an 80% relative risk reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk 14 days after asingle dose of either vaccine and may help to enhance this model. 92 As shown in Figure 1 , multiple international public health agencies and allergy organizations around the world have issued guidance related to concerns for severe allergic reactions specif- ically to the mRNA vaccines that generally echo the CDC rec-ommendations. Many also emphasize shared decision-makingand all suggest consideration of allergy-immunology consulta- tion. Most lack explicit language formally recommending testing to excipients (including PEG) or the vaccine itself as part of theevaluation (owing to the absence of evidence and predictive values for the testing). 88,93Only the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) and WAO suggestconsideration for skin testing to the vaccine or its components (eg, PEG, polysorbate) in some cases. 8,24A recommendation for such patients to undergo evaluation by an allergist may or maynot imply consideration for testing as part of this evaluation,although the nature of what should be part of such evaluation is not speci ed. Threshold agreement was achieved for the voting on these recommendations on the rst round of voting (Table E3 ). Question 2. In patients without a history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or its excipients, should allergy skin testing to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines orits excipients be performed? Recommendation 3 In patients with no history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or its excipients, we recommend against vaccine or vaccine excipient testing prior to vaccination in an attempt to predict the rare individual whowill have a severe allergic reaction to vaccination. Strong recommendation; low certainty of evidence. Rationale Systematic review and meta-analysisSystematic review regarding the incidence and/or prevalence of PEG or polysorbate allergy identi ed 1 study among 608 citations, with an additional study under review also identi-ed. 16In a review of a Canadian national physician-reported drug allergy database entries from 2015 to 2018, Abrams et al78found allergy to PEG or medications containing PEG/ polysorbate in 135 cases out of 1,055,667 entries of allergic drug reactions, for an incidence of 42.6 cases per million person-years. This report described no cases in which PEG-allergic individuals had reported cross-reactivity to anypolysorbate-containing medicine (and the individuals with polysorbate allergy only reacted to a single agent). 78In the other report, Stone et al16compiled a review of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 1989 through 2017, nding 53 probable cases of anaphylaxis to PEG among 25,905 reports,for an estimated incidence of 4 cases of PEG allergy per year (0.012 cases per million person-years).

J ALTable E2 details the certainty of evidence for this estimate and Figure E3 the risk of bias assessment. Discussion Historically, vaccines have contained inert excipients such as food proteins (eg, egg, gelatin, yeast) or other substances (eg, thimerosal, formaldehyde, latex, neomycin, adjuvants), as well as viral proteins and bacterial toxoids, to which reported adverse re-actions, including allergic reactions of varying severity have beenattributed. 94The mRNA vaccines utilize newer technology that differs from existing vaccines in that they do not contain histori- cally commonly used excipients. Because these vaccines involvenanotechnology to deliver mRNA to recipient cells, they use other excipients, most notably PEG 2000 but also additional lipids and cholesterol. 8,9The AstraZeneca, Sputnik, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines each contain recombinant adenovirus and polysorbate 80.10,11,86Adenovector virus vaccines are not novel technologies. Table III details the excipients in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. From a societal standpoint, the population prevalence of PEG and polysorbate allergies are very rare. In addition, data regarding population-based skin test screening using SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are sparse \u2014at the time of writing only 1 published study de- tailing SARS-CoV-2 prick testing prior to initial vaccination for persons (who had not yet received SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) with a general history of anaphylaxis, which noted no positive skintests. 95The very rare rate of adjudicated cases of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine anaphylaxis and a lack of evidence that COVID-19 vaccine reactions are attributable to PEG or polysorbatestrongly suggest against any population-based approach that would involve screening for preexisting speci c immunoglobulin E (IgE) against PEG or polysorbate as a means to predict risk of asevere allergic reaction to a SARS-CoV 2 vaccine. 14,18Threshold agreement was achieved for the voting on this recommendation on the rst round of voting ( Table E3 ). Part 2: Recommendations for individuals before their initial or additional SARS-CoV-2 vaccination whohave a history of an allergic reaction to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or its excipients Question 3. In patients with a history of a severe allergic re- action, including anaphylaxis, to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or itsexcipients, should allergy skin testing to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or its excipients be performed to determine whether vaccine with- holding is needed? Recommendation 4We suggest against the clinician routinely performing skin or in vitro testing using SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or excipients outside of the research setting for the purpose of vaccine withholding,given such testing has unknown sensitivity/speci city in pre- dicting severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to SARS- CoV-2 vaccines. Conditional recommendation; low certainty of evidence.Rationale Systematic review and meta-analysis The utility of PEG testing to inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine risk of allergic reaction is uncertain. However, data are available to understand how well such testing performs in evaluating persons with a known or suspected allergic reaction to PEG orpolysorbate in other contexts. A systematic review identi ed 21 studies (all case reports/series) out of 548 citations (excluding duplicates) that described skin testing (skin prick or intrader- mal) to PEG of any molecular weight and/or polysorbate 80, inwhich control subjects were also tested. 15,16,96-114Ap o s i t i v e case was de ned as any method of skin testing performed with PEG or polysorbate concentration in which the authors deemedthe test positive for identi cation of a wheal and/or flare, without any speci c or uniform threshold reported. For PEG, there were 15 reports detailing s kin testing to varying agents and concentrations. 15,16,96-108Following removal of 7 positive skin tests that were duplicated from 5 other studies in 1 large case series of 37 cases since 1977, we calculated a pooledsensitivity of 58.8% (30 true positive, 21 false negative) andspecicity of 99.5% (247 true negative, 1 false positive). However, the speci city may be falsely high owing to the case series/report study designs. As well, among the reports, not allpatients were challenged to con rm the history of PEG reac- tion, the diagnostic gold standard, which lowers the certainty of evidence owing to indirectness of the testing. There were 6reports detailing 7 total patients with suspected allergy to polysorbate that had skin testing (no false positives, and 57 controls tested that were nonreactive). 109-114Polysorbate testing sensitivity/speci city were not calculated given per (0.00-0.03)Proportion (95% CI) 100 1,000 Cases per million patient-years FIGURE 3.

The same systematic review identi ed no studies that inves- tigated vaccine or excipient testing compared with negative controls in individuals with a known or suspected allergic reac- tion of any severity to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, 4 casereports (without controls) were identi ed describing testing with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine or PEG/polysorbate in persons with reported severe allergic reactions to the vaccine, and vaccinetesting in negative controls to establish a nonirritating testing concentration. 115-117The rst report details negative vaccine skin testing among 4 persons with reported allergic reactions totheir initial vaccination, 3 of whom elected to receive a seconddose and did so without reaction. 116The second report details negative PEG 3350 testing in 8 persons with reported allergic reactions their initial vaccine, 7 of whom elected to receive asecond dose and did so without reaction; as well as negative polysorbate 80 testing in 6 of 7 persons tested prior to their initial vaccination, with all 6 receiving their initial dose withoutreacting. 115The third report details no irritant response detected among 55 negative controls tested to SARS-CoV mRNA vac- cine.117The fourth detailed 2 adult patients with severe allergic reactions to their initial mRNA (Moderna) vaccine, whounderwent skin testing to PEG, polysorbate, and the mRNA vaccine itself. In both patients, excipient skin testing was negative but intradermal skin tests to the Moderna vaccine were positive. However, both tolerated graded dosing administration of thevaccine without issue. 118Lastly, 1 additional case report of PEG testing was identi ed in a female patient with a past history of skin and oropharyngeal reactions to PEG-containing products,who sought evaluation after experiencing a reported systemic reaction to her initial dose of the P zer-BioNTech vaccine that was treated with epinephrine but was not associated with tryptaseelevation. While undergoing testing, approximately 12 minutes after PEG 4000 prick skin test was applied, she developed a multisystem systemic reaction treated with epinephrine, whichalso was not associated with tryptase elevation. Skin testing to thePzer-BioNTech vaccine and to PEG molecular weight less than 4,000 were all negative, and neither vaccine rechallenge nor challenge to PEG 4000 or any other molecular weight PEG wereattempted. 119One other case report was noted regarding an atopic female with a past episode of urticaria attributable to a topical product possibly containing PEG, who developed anerythematous rash, then slurred mouth and hoarseness over the course of 5 hours after her initial P zer-BioNTech vaccine (although she had no symptoms at 30 minutes). Her serumtryptase level was normal, and this reaction occurred despite 2Decreasing Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Reaction FIGURE 4.

During evaluation by an allergy specialist 2 weeks after the event, whereas no PEG or vaccine skin testing was reported, she was noted to have anelevated basophil activation test (14.79 CD203c high%) to PEG 4000 at 0.2mg/mL (and no activation seen in 5 negative control patients).120 Discussion PEG-2000 is speculated to be a potential culprit in allergic reactions to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.14,121PEG and polysorbate are ubiquitous compounds, found in many health and beauty products and in foods and beverages, and are routinely used and tolerated in daily life.14There are limited case reports in the medical literature of allergic reactions attributableto PEG contained in therapeutic agents and radiocontrast me- dia. 15,16,96,122-124PEG is available in different molecular weights and structural formats. Allergic reactions may be more likely withhigher molecular weight PEG agents, higher concentrations, or parenteral administration. It is uncertain whether the concen- tration and molecular weight of PEG in SARS-CoV-2 mRNAvaccines would be suf cient to cause reactions. 15,16There is theoretical concern, but limited evidence, that PEG may cross- react with certain polysorbates.16Polysorbate 80 in adenovirus- vector vaccines was not implicated as causing allergic reactionsin their trials, and there is limited reporting of allergic reactions of any severity with these vaccines. Evaluation for suspected PEG allergy is largely based on his- tory. Use of high molecular weight PEG solutions as skin testing agents has not consistently demonstrated the ability to elicit wheal and flare responses, and it remains unclear whether this approach would reliably indicate the presence (or absence) of specic IgE. 123In this meta-analysis, the pooled sensitivity of PEG skin testing is only 58.8%, but the pooled speci city is 99.5%, which implies that the test will miss identifying the presence of PEG-speci c IgE in a signi cant number of PEG- allergic patients, but non ePEG-allergic individuals do not appear to have false-positive tests. There have been few cases ofanaphylaxis reported to intradermal skin testing, mainly using PEG with molecular weight greater than 3,000. Other non- validated methods of detection for PEG-induced allergicresponse have been described, as has PEG oral provocation challenge. 15,16,96In individuals with a high pretest probability of PEG allergy, testing to PEG from these data in the meta-analysisshow a very uncertain (very serious risk of bias) high positive likelihood ratio to con rm the diagnosis. However, this is distinct from the suggestion that PEG testing can inform thelikelihood of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine reaction (very serious indirectness). This was noted in case series to date in which 10 persons who reacted to their mRNA vaccine, in fact, had negativePEG skin testing, and in which 2 patients additionally were skintested to PEG as well as to both polysorbate (negative) and the Moderna vaccine (positive intradermal test) and tolerated read- ministration. 115,118In the case of a person with a mRNA vaccine reaction in which PEG sensitization was detected, this was only to PEG 4000, and not the vaccine or the concentration of PEG in the vaccine. There is not yet any convincing evidence toconrm PEG as a causative agent in the reported SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine reactions and the diagnostic utility of PEG and polysorbate allergy testing is highly uncertain. 14,18,88,121Of note, skin testing to the vaccines is not approved under any of theEUAs. Further research regarding excipient and vaccine skin testing in this context is needed. Other mechanisms might potentially cause allergic symptoms following administration of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.Complement Activation eRelated Pseudoallergy (CARPA) has been theorized as a possible mechanism, in particular with lipids used in drug delivery. 125,126The mRNA particles themselves may also potentially be a causative agent, acting as a direct mast cell degranulation agent. There is 1 report that trometamol, a buffer speci c to the Moderna vaccine, was associated with anaphylaxis to gadolinium-based contrast agents, also by a direct degranulation mechanism.127Toll-like receptors 3, 7, and 8 can be directly activated by double-stranded and single-strandedRNA particles from viruses and can cause mast cell degranula-tion. 128,129Although the likelihood of such events from a SARS- CoV-2 mRNA vaccine is unclear, these pathways should be considered among the potential mechanisms for allergic reactionsto these vaccines. 130 Caution should be exercised in considering excipients as a provoking cause of vaccine reactions. Whereas excipients haveoccasionally caused allergic reactions with other vaccines, his- torically many excipients have also been wrongly implicated based on theoretical rather than actual risk, most prominentlyegg (ovalbumin) in modern in fluenza vaccines. 73,94,131This may be due to excipient concentrations being well below a threshold necessary to provoke a reaction.132,133This may also prove to be the case for excipients that are suspected triggers for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine reactions. There is 1 published approach for SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination with guidance based on skin testing to excipi-ents. 14,18Notably, if methylprednisolone acetate is used for testing, the clinician should be aware this may contain both PEG and polysorbate 80, and should test only with brands of meth-ylprednisolone that do not also contain polysorbate 80. 14The clinician should also be aware that the quantity of PEG administered by intradermal testing using this agent could exceedthe quantity of PEG in the P zer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, which only contains 0.05 mg PEG 2000 per dose ( Table E6 ; available in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci- inpractice.org ). Therefore, even in persons with known PEG allergy who have positive PEG skin testing, it is likely that graded or full dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine would be well tolerated if no systemic allergic reaction occurred during skin testing. Thepositive PEG test is less problematic to interpret, given this specicity, but no data exist to specify that positive PEG sensi- tization de nitively infers a signi cant risk that such patients will not tolerate PEG-containing vaccines. As such, there is no clear role for the use of skin testing to PEG to inform a decision to withhold the vaccine or not, which is consistent with the lastpublished vaccine allergy practice parameter, which suggestsexcipient- or vaccine-sensitized individuals should be offered a graded-dose challenge or multistep desensitization instead of withholding the vaccine. 14,94Data regarding skin testing to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine itself are scant. There are a small number of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 vaccine reactions who have undergone vaccine testing, most with negative results, butall who were willing to receive a second dose tolerated it without reaction irrespective of positive vaccine skin testing. 115,116,118 The 3 individuals with a history of mRNA reaction with sensi- tization to either the vaccine or PEG either declined or were notJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT MONTH 202114 GREENHAWT ET ALoffered the opportunity to receive a second dose. If vaccine testing is to be performed in persons hesitant to proceed with vaccination, the vaccine should be prepared per manufacturer instructions with regard to storage, thawing, and diluting forreconstitution. Consistent with the last published vaccine prac- tice parameter, patients with positive skin testing to a SARS- CoV-2 vaccine may receive vaccination through graded or fulldosing (see later). 118Limited safety data are available for testing to the vaccine or the vaccine excipients in this context. Further details regarding international variation about recommendationsfor vaccine/excipient testing are detailed in Figure 1 . Whereas testing may be considered as a preference-sensitive option in shared decision making, options for cautiousadministration of vaccine ( Figure 4 ) or the use of an alternative vaccine with a different platform and excipient may be addi- tional considerations. Testing for PEG has not been shown to be necessary or of value in individuals with a history of severeallergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to mRNA SARS- CoV-2 vaccines, nor has PEG yet been demonstrated as the causative agent of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine eallergic re- actions. Moreover, it has poor sensitivity in evaluating those with known severe allergic reactions to PEG. However, PEG testing may be considered in the very narrow context of shareddecision-making in individuals who would otherwise be un-willing to be vaccinated and would decline vaccination if not offered testing. Testing-speci c guidance could change if and when convincing evidence emerges for a role for PEG as aculprit agent. The PEG 2000, the actual excipient, would likely be preferable to higher molecular weight PEG as a testing agent, if available. Given the low mortality ofanaphylaxis ( <0.5%) in general, 134and the higher mortality/ m o r b i d i t yo fC O V I D - 1 9 ,t h er i s ko fw i t h h o l d i n gS A R S - C o V - 2 vaccination is highly likely to exceed the risk of a severeallergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, after administration of the vaccine for many patients. However, this consideration regarding withholding additional vaccine doses could change ifadditional estimates eme rge of potentially high ef cacy of a single dose of an mRNA vaccine, which could allow more time for decision making regarding the risk/reward of additional dosing. 92Threshold agreement was achieved for the voting on this recommendation on the rst round of voting ( Table E3 ). Question 4. Should SARS-CoV-2 mRNA or adenovirus- vector vaccines be administered to an individual who had animmediate allergic reaction to the rst dose of the vaccine (dened as a generalized, systemic allergic reaction with acute onset occurring within 4 hours of vaccine administration) orgiven as a rst dose to an individual who is suspected to have reacted previously to an excipient ingredient that is also present in the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA or adenovirus-vector vaccines? Recommendation 5We recommend a shared decision-making paradigm of care favoring vaccination through full or graded dosing (with or without additional observation time post-vaccination) orchanging vaccine platforms to another agent over no vaccination because there is no single best approach to assessment and management of the patient with a suspected SARS-CoV-2mRNA or adenovirus-vector vaccine reaction or the patient with an allergy to an excipient in either of these vaccines who has not yet been vaccinated. Strong recommendation; moderate certainty of evidenceRecommendation 6 In patients with a suspected immediate allergic reaction to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine whose standard schedule requires more than 1 dose, we recommend referral to an allergist for assessmentof additional vaccination over no vaccination/vaccination being withheld. In resource-limited settings in which specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives may be presented in a shareddecision-making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, use of alternative vaccine products, or delay in vaccination until a solution can bedetermined. Strong recommendation; moderate certainty of evidence Recommendation 7In patients with a suspected or con rmed but remote past medical history of reaction to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine excipient, we recommend referral to an allergist for assessment of additional vaccination over no vaccination/vaccination being withheld. Inresource-limited settings in which specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives may be presented in a shared decision- making context to provide assessment and opportunity forvaccination by remote consultation, use of alternative vaccine products, or delay in vaccination until a solution can be determined. Strong recommendation; moderate certainty of evidenceRecommendation 8 In patients with a de nite/con rmed recent allergic reaction to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and/or excipient, we recommend referralto an allergist for assessment of additional vaccination over no vaccination/vaccination being withheld. In resource-limited set- tings in which specialist referral is not readily available, alterna-tives may be presented in a shared decision-making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, use of alternative vaccine products, or delay invaccination until a solution can be determined. Strong recommendation; low certainty of evidence Recommendation 9Whereas all vaccines should be administered in facilities capable of treating anaphylaxis, particularly for individuals with a prior immediate systemic allergic reaction to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or vaccine excipient, we recommend the clinicianshould administer SARS-CoV-2 mRNA or adenovirus-vector vaccine in a setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis (eg, hos- pital, mass immunization clinic, specialist of ce), under the su- pervision of personnel trained in the recognition and management of anaphylaxis. In resource-limited settings in which specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives maybe presented in a shared decision-making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consul- tation, use of alternative vaccine products, or delay in vaccinationuntil a solution can be determined. Strong recommendation; moderate certainty of evidence Recommendation 10 We suggest against routine H1-antihistamine or systemic corticosteroid premedication prior to vaccination because it has low-certainty evidence in preventing anaphylaxis, and theoreti- cally, corticosteroid premedication could diminish the immuneresponse. Conditional recommendation; low certainty of evidence Recommendation 11We recommend in favor of globally coordinated research studies being conducted to address (1) vaccine and vaccineJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT VOLUME -, NUMBER -GREENHAWT ET 15excipient testing diagnostic accuracy for allergy to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines; (2) administration of the vaccine to individuals with prior anaphylaxis to the vaccine or vaccine excipient; (3) the necessity and ef cacy of graded vaccine administration in the context of a patient with possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allergy; (4) the safety, ef cacy, and necessity of mixing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms; and (5) the incremental bene t of additional doses of an mRNA or certain adenovirus-vector vaccines following an initial dose. Research recommendationRationale/discussion Almost all allergy organizations recommend that the routine administration of SARS-CoV-2 v accines are contraindicated in individuals with a suspected immediate allergic reaction to theSARS-CoV-2 vaccines or their components (ie, PEG or poly- sorbate 80), although all allow consideration of referral to an allergist-immunologist to determine the likelihood the initialreported reaction was consistent with an allergic reaction of any severity, and if so, whether a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can be safely administered ( Figure 1 ). There is similar consistency in the precaution for patients with nonanaphylactic reactions to the initial vaccine dose (and for the CDC, a history of im- mediate allergic reactions to other vaccines or injectable med-ications) to be considered for vaccination underobservation. 86,135The Sputnik vaccine is contraindicated in people with a hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine compo- nents or any vaccine containing similar components, as well ascontraindicated in people with a history of severe allergic re- action to the vaccine or its excipients. In addition, the second dose of the Sputnik vaccine is contraindicated where severecomplications, such as anaphylactic shock, severe generalized allergic reaction, seizures, or fever over 40 /C14C were noted after therst dose.136The CDC has issued a precaution to receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in persons in whom the SARS- CoV-2 mRNA vaccine is contraindicated and suggested an option for administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine atleast 28 days after the initial SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinedose, although the incremental safety and effectiveness of such a substitution is unknown. 137The Johnson & Johnson vaccine carries with it a risk of thrombotic events (as does the Astra-Zeneca vaccine), which should be a consideration in this decision. 138,139 Preference-sensitive care is de ned by scenarios in which there are multiple treatment options having signi cant trade- offs and varying potential outcomes, where treatment de- cisions re flect the patient 's personal values and preferences.140 Despite general international agreement that evaluation by an allergist-immunologist be considered for patients with sus- pected risk of allergic reaction to the vaccine, there is noelaboration on how the allergy specialist should evaluate thesepatients to determine whether vaccination is advisable and how to proceed. The allergist can be of central importance in this evaluation process by taking a detailed history that thoroughlyinvestigates the nature and timing of the reported reaction and carefully considers the nature of the reported symptoms and whether they are the result of an immune-mediated process andnot the result of any mimicking condition that could be the result of a nonallergic process. This step alone is of critical importance and may represent the greatest value that theallergist can offer as an expert in such evaluation. Also criticalto involvement of the allergist in this process is for the personsproviding vaccination to be trained to ask questions regarding risk of reaction and help facilitate referral to the allergist ifthere is a contraindication to receiving a dose or in the case of a suspected allergic reaction occurring at their site. If possible, p a t i e n t sw i t hah i s t o r yo fap o s s i b l ea l l e r g yt oP E G ,p o l y -sorbate, other vaccines, or even their initial SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should be encouraged to be proactive in discussing this with their primary care provider before seeking initial oradditional SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses. The 2012 Adverse Reactions to Vaccine Practice Parameter (from the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immu- nology [AAAAI] and American College of Allergy Asthma andImmunology [ACAAI] Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters) outlines a general approach for a patient with a known or sus- pected history of a vaccine/vaccine excipient reaction. 94This includes possible vaccine and excipient testing and several contextualized ways for vaccines to be administered. This approach recognizes that, whereas administration of a vaccine inroutine medical settings (eg, nonallergy specialist) isTABLE IV.

The ACAAI COVID-19 task force outlines, but does not endorse, an approach of graded vaccine challenge that could be consideredfor certain individuals. At least 1 case report has demonstrated this is both safe and feasible, although it is unclear whether this is necessary. 118The ASCIA, Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI) and European Academy of Al- lergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) provide guidance for graded challenges in these patients and are consistent with the2012 Practice Parameter. 21,141,142However, none of these rec- ommendations have data denoting safety. The COVID-19 pandemic and rami cations of SARS-CoV-2 infection represent a highly unique situation relative to otherinfectious diseases in terms of the global burden of this disease, and an imperative international public health need to attain herd immunity through vaccination. Any potential for vaccine refusalor the vaccine being withheld in a pandemic must be approached from an ethical perspective that considers whether SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral propagation are riskier outcomes than vacci-nation in a setting in which severe allergic reactions can be managed. 143Whereas no single best choice in these contexts exists, it can be addressed through an individualized, shareddecision-making approach reviewing treatment options and therisk-to-bene t trade-offs related to vaccine reactions versus SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. Regardless of how the vaccine is administered, we recommend against routine premedicationprior to vaccination (particularly with glucocorticosteroids) because it has low-certainty evidence in preventing anaphylaxis, and glucocorticosteroid premedication (or glucocorticosteroidtreatment of any suspected allergic reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines including anaphylaxis) could diminish the immune response. 144,145 Figure 4 outlines preference-sensitive approaches to the indi- vidual who had an allergic reaction to the initial dose of the vaccine. The allergist 's role here is central as well in helping a patient clarify their values as to their choices and the outcomes ofthose choices in proceeding with or declining vaccination. These approaches are only recommended for trained experts in the diagnosis of medication allergy (including allergic reactions tovaccines and medication-provocation challenge), in facilities staffed with personnel skilled and trained to be able to assess and treat an allergic reaction resulting from testing or vaccineadministration. Resources must be available to provide direct observation of patients for a minimum of 30 minutes after the vaccine is administered. The outlined approaches all involvesome degree of trade-off, and the ultimate choice must be informed by the values, goals, and preferences of patients. These issues must be balanced against increased infection risk, withincreased morbidity and mortality, which becomes a risk fromvaccine refusal or withholding vaccination. Graded vaccine challenge does offer some practical reassurance to the patient and clinician reluctant to proceed with single-dose vaccination,although full-dose vaccination may be just as safe as a graded approach in many circumstances. In resource-limited settings or if consultation with an allergy specialist is not readily available,such as in rural settings or in low- and middle-income countries, such shared decision making does not need to be exclusively provided by a specialist. Although specialist referral would bepreferred, any clinician may engage the patient in shareddecision-making based on the options in Figure 4 , allowing forlocal context in decision making, with input to the patient from the practitioners who are trusted by the local population. In particular, if rst-dose protection of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is high, or there is availability of an alternative vaccine platform,particular preference may be given for vaccine refusal/with- holding the vaccine or administering this alternative agent in certain local and regional settings. Experience with graded challenge with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines is limited at present to 1 very small case series. The efcacy of graded vaccination is unknown, although 1 report has shown this can be successful. 118It is unknown whether splitting doses and/or diluting the vaccine outside of the initial manu- facturer recommendation would disrupt the vaccine integrity orimpair immune response. However, these variables may poten-tially contribute to unforeseen issues in trying to adapt previously recommended approaches for vaccine administration where there is concern of possible allergy, rendering this option for graded-dose administration less preferable than single-dose administra- tion. 94Switching from one vaccine platform to another is an additional alternative to consider in this decisional matrix thatmay reduce reliance on graded dosing and may be a more feasible ofce-based choice, which is endorsed by a number of interna- tional regulatory health agencies on which multiple vaccine op-tions are approved ( Figure 1 ). 137 The evaluation of individuals with a known or suspected PEG allergy (including anaphylaxis) but who have not yet received a vaccine is distinct. An algorithm for excipient testing has beenpublished, but without evidence that the vaccine excipients are the cause of any vaccine reactions or that excipient allergic/ sensitized individuals cannot tolerate the vaccine. Our meta-analysis suggests skin testing to excipients as a screening mea- sure prior to vaccination has low sensitivity and is unlikely to reliably identify persons at risk. A choice to test and thenrecommend a sensitized person not receive an mRNA vaccine could unnecessarily withhold an intervention based on specula- tion of risk or force choice of an alternative vaccine platform (ifavailable) that may have different nonimmunological risks.However, this could be a preference-sensitive option that con- cerned patients elect, and a negative skin test could be viewed as reassuring to proceed with use of an mRNA vaccination, despitethe test having poor sensitivity. Similarly, it is reasonable to administer an mRNA vaccine following a shared decision- making process with an allergy specialist, as either a single or agraded dose, or to provide an adenovirus-vector vaccine (with precaution given polysorbate content) without testing. For in- dividuals with a polysorbate allergy, it is reasonable to administeran adenovirus-vector vaccine following a shared decision-making process with an allergy specialist, as either a single or a graded dose, or to provide an mRNA vaccine (with precaution givenPEG content) without testing. Either vaccine should be given ina setting in which the patient can be monitored for up to 30 minutes after vaccination and that is staffed and equipped to treat potential vaccine-associated anaphylaxis. Withholding or refusing a second dose of an mRNA vaccine (either Moderna or P zer-BioNTech) has been considered by some, in the belief that the initial dose will provide adequateprotection. Although we lack precise estimates of what consti- tutes durable protective adaptive immunity postvaccination, data from the EUA suggest there is 50% or greater protection at 2 ormore weeks after the rst dose (prior to administration of the second dose). Israeli reports suggest 33% to 60% protectionJ ALLERGY -GREENHAWT ET AL 17more than 2 weeks after the rst dose up to the time of the second dose.146Additional studies have suggested rst-dose protection of up to 93% but with wide ranges of protection reported.9,58,90,92,147-149However, the duration of this partial protection is unknown, but likely shorter-lived than the immu- nity achieved after 2 doses or achieved naturally from SARS- CoV-2 infection. Optimal longer-term protection would beensured by complete vaccination. Partial immunity at a com- munity level is of concern because it might theoretically enable the spread of more virulent variants of the virus. Even within ashared decision-making paradigm, vaccine refusal or withholding a vaccine should remain an option of last resort, and all steps taken to avoid this outcome. Withholding/refusal, if chosen,should be clearly documented in the medical record, and thedecision to do so made collaboratively by the patient after having been provided data regarding the nature of the risks. 90 Threshold agreement was achieved for the voting on these recommendations on the rst round of voting ( Table E3 ). This document has several limitations. First, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is a new and evolving topic, and data to dateregarding allergic reactions, potential provoking causes of these reactions, and best management practices are limited. As such, there is intent to continue to reevaluate and update these rec-ommendations as more data are published regarding reactionsand their management. Second, GRADE is one evidence-rating approach and has well-described limitations. Third, in this context, several recommendations are conditional, and have lowcertainty of evidence, which underscores the rst limitation. This in particular may impact recommendations regarding excipient and/or direct vaccine testing, as well as considerations aboutwithholding/refusing vaccination (initial or subsequent doses) or the best initial choice of a vaccine given a patient 's history. Fourth, to perform the meta-analysis and data pooling forquestions 2 and 3, we made 2 major assumptions: (1) we considered all reactions coded in a Canadian drug allergy data- base as allergy to PEG or PEG-containing medications asanaphylaxis; and (2) we considered any positive PEG skin test, byany method (prick or intradermal), to any listed concentration, as the same for the purposes of denoting a positive result to assess testing sensitivity and speci city. Both these assumptions allow for a liberal consideration of what de nes a case, and increases the potential sensitivity of the analysis, at the risk of in flating both estimates. However, given limited data, we feel these arejustied. Fifth, whereas our approach and recommendations were developed through systematic evidence synthesis, in some instances, these recommendations contradict more empiricalapproaches from allergy professional societies and governmental health authorities. It is of note that no approach or recommen- dation \u2014ones made in this document or made previously by any society or governmental health authority \u2014have been proven safe by high certainty of evidence in the context of evaluating sus- pected allergic reactions to these vaccines. Lastly, our recom- mendations may be limited to the populations that have beenstudied. Our approaches and considerations may be more or less relevant in particular countries or regions, depending on gov- ernment policy, access to vaccination, access to allergy specialistsfor evaluation of potential reactions, and availability of resources for some of the options in our shared decision-making paradigm. In this analysis, there were no studies identi ed that addressed this issue in the context of low- to middle-income areas orresource-limited areas, and most of the studies on vaccineanaphylaxis are from tertiary-care centers, which by de nition are areas with access to specialty care, including allergists. In areas without access to an allergist, remote health care options or involvement of a health care provider who can assess and managevaccine reactions could be considered, although this does not address individuals without access to care or locations lacking in some of the resources described. It is possible that recommen-dations made by an allergy specialist who is not actually administering the vaccine to another care provider who is doing so may not necessarily be accepted by others who may have lessexperience in treating anaphylaxis, or with administering a vac- cine to someone who has been evaluated for a vaccine-associated allergic reaction. These factors may modify the recommendationsstated. The Evidence to Decision Framework supplement pro-vides a summary re flection of the evidence in the context of the clinical recommendation and helps balance the recommenda- tions in light of these limitations. CONCLUSION The SARS-CoV-2 is a devastating global pandemic with limited treatment options, which has caused more than3,000,000 global fatalities and more than $10 trillion in global economic costs. 3To achieve an optimal population herd im- munity and mitigate the impact of this infection, vaccinationrepresents the optimal global strategy. Multiple vaccines have proven to be safe and effective in clinical trials and are now in use. Potential allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have beenreported, but these have occurred very rarely. No uniform rec-ommendations exist on an approach to the assessment and management of individuals with a known or suspected allergy to the excipients or the vaccine itself. This document providesevidence-based (where available) expert consensus that in- corporates guidance from clinical specialists in Australia, Canada, Europe, Russia, South Africa, the United States, and the UnitedKingdom stressing a patient-centered approach involving consideration of the risks and bene ts of receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, the value and cost effectiveness of testing and pre-cautionary measures, and shared decision making in recognition of multiple preference-sensitive approaches to this issue from an international perspective. There is no clear evidence that anypreexisting factor, or testing with the vaccine or excipients, canpredict risk of reaction to the vaccine. Because this is the rst experience with these vaccines, this is intended to be a living document that will require periodic updating owing to still-emerging needs assessment, including further research data on the nature of vaccine-associated reactions and the necessity of potential risk-assessment measures. There are continued knowl-edge gaps and unmet needs outlined in Table IV that must be addressed as the vaccine roll-out continues. Given an imperative global need to vaccinate as many people in as many countries aspossible, the clinician should be familiar with the risk of potential reactions to these vaccines and the approach to their evaluation and management.
