Ferris, MD, Jennifer L. Waller, PhD, Jeremiah Miller, Pratik Patel, George A. Price, Lanier Jackson, and Courtesia Wilson Objective: To determine correlates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine acceptance for men. Methods: A convenience sample of men aged 18 to 45 years read a one-page information sheet about HPV and the HPV vaccine, then completed a 29-item questionnaire. /H92732tests were used to determine whether differences in demographic, sexual, and vaccine-related variables existed between levels of wanting the HPV vaccine. Results: Positive correlates of HPV vaccine acceptance included higher education ( P<.0001); his- panic ethnicity ( P/H11549.0003); wearing a seat belt most of the time ( P/H11549.02); regular tobacco use ( P/H11549 <.001); not being sexually active ( P/H11549.0008); history of more than 10 female sexual partners ( P/H11549 .0004); not having oral sex ( P/H11549.045); extreme worry about vaccine side effects ( P<.0001); extreme concern about vaccine safety ( P<.0001); the importance of getting vaccines ( P<.0001); familiarity with HPV (P <.0001); and extreme importance of receiving the HPV vaccine ( P<.0001). Conclusions: Men with greater general education, high-risk behaviors, and knowledge about HPV are more likely to want the HPV vaccine. Focused educational efforts should facilitate even wider accep-tance of the HPV vaccine by men. (J Am Board Fam Med 2009;22:34 - 42.) In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the quadrivalent human papillo-mavirus (HPV, types 6/11/16 and 18) L1 data, vaccine should reduce theincidence of cervical cancer by 70% and genitalwarts by 90%. Universal protection is affordedwhen administered to people not previously ex-posed to the HPV types covered by the vaccine.Currently, the vaccine is approved for use in 9- to26-year-old girls and women. Many low-risk and high-risk types of HPV can also infect various anatomic sites in boys and men. 5 The low-risk types of HPV cause recurrent respi-ratory papillomatosis or condylomata of the naso-pharynx. 6,7Anogenital warts are also caused by low-risk HPV types 6 and 11. High-risk HPV types cause precancers and cancer of the penis andanus. 8 -13HPV 16, a particularly virulent type, causes head and neck cancer.14,15Just as with women, men experience signicant morbidity andpotential mortality from HPV-related diseases. Women clearly benet from receiving the HPV vaccine. One would assume men could also benetby being vaccinated against low- and high-riskHPV types. Correlates of HPV vaccine acceptancehave been identied for mid-adult women. 16How- ever, correlates of HPV vaccine acceptance amongmen have not been described. The purpose of theseanalyses were to determine correlates of HPV vac-cine acceptance among men.

We did not exclude men based on a medical history ofHPV-related disease or genital warts. The MedicalCollege of Georgia Human Assurance Committeereviewed and approved (HAC File #07 to 06 to313) this study. Study Instrument Our survey was developed by initially modifying formale gender use an existing mid-adult woman'ssurvey about the HPV vaccine. 17This similar ver - sion allowed for comparisons between the sexes. Adiverse focus group of 7 men then read a gender-modied HPV information sheet before providingcritical feedback about the survey. The HPV infor-mation sheet addressed HPV risk factors, preven-tion, infection sequelae, and the quadrivalent HPVvaccine. 17Suggestions from the focus group were used to revise the draft survey. The 29-question survey was modied so it could be completed in 10 minutes or less. Questions ad-dressed demographic data, history of sexually trans-mitted infections, sexual history and preference,lifestyles practices, attitudes toward vaccines ingeneral, knowledge of HPV and the HPV vaccine,and men's reasons for wanting or not wanting toreceive the HPV vaccine. True or false, yes or no,and multiple choice question types were included. Study Design The study was designed to determine correlates ofHPV vaccine acceptance among 18- to 45-year-oldmen. Men appearing to be within the specied agerange were asked to complete a brief survey aboutthe HPV vaccine. Interested and eligible men reada letter of invitation and a 1-page information sheetabout HPV and the vaccine. Men then completedthe self-administered survey. To protect conden-tiality, no subject specic identiers were recordedon the surveys. Responses were returned in a sealedenvelope. The same investigators (JM, PP, LJ, andCW) administered all surveys and entered data.Men were not compensated for their participation.This study was conducted 14 months after FDAapproval of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine for usein 9- to 26-year-old girls and women. Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were calculated on all vari-ables. /H9273 2tests were used to examine whether dif - ferences in demographic, sexual, and vaccine-re-lated variables existed between levels of wanting toget the HPV vaccine (yes, no, or don't know).Statistical signicance was assessed using an /H9251level of 0.05 and all statistical analyses were performedusing SAS software version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute,Inc., Cary, NC). Results Of approximately 650 men who were asked to vol-unteer, complete data were available for 571 men.Insufcient time to complete the survey and gen-eral lack of interest were the most common reasonsfor nonparticipation. Detailed demographic datahave been previously published. 18However, in summary, most men were white (61.0%) with atleast a high school education (96.5%) and youngerthan 30 years old (69.2%). Approximately half(52.1%) had a family income of less than $50,000per year and the majority (86.6%) had some type ofmedical insurance. Almost two-thirds (64.2%) wereof the Protestant faith. Most to be heterosexual.Nearly three-quarters (74.4%) were sexually activeand 83.1% had initiated sexual activity by the age of18. Only 2.3% had a history of genital warts. Of the 571 subjects, 33% wanted to be vacci- nated against HPV, 27% did and 40% wereundecided. 18We compared demographic data with HPV vaccine preference to determine correlates ofvaccine acceptance among men (Table 1). Differ-ences in wanting to get the HPV vaccine werefound for various demographic variables, includingage, race, education, martial status, wearing a seat-belt, and using tobacco. A greater percentage ofmen who did not want to get the vaccine were older(P/H11005.0009), black (P /H11005.0003), and had a lower education level (P /H11021.001). Men who were unde- cided about receiving the vaccine were more likelyto be younger and white. Being a college graduateor Hispanic were positive correlates for vaccineacceptance. Men who were undecided about receiv-ing the vaccine were more likely to be single andmen who did not want the vaccine were most likelyto be living with a partner ( P/H11005.02). Men who want the vaccine were more like to wear their seatbeltmost of the time (P /H11005.018). Regular use of tobacco correlated positively with vaccine acceptance ( P/H11005 .001).

Downloaded from ences for wanting to receive the HPV vaccine were seen for the variables of being sexually active, life-time number of female sexual partners, oral sex,and frequency of sex. Men who wanted to be vac-cinated were more likely to not be currently sexu-ally active and men who were undecided aboutvaccination were most likely to be virgins ( P/H11005 .0008). Men with the greatest lifetime number offemale sexual partners were most likely to want thevaccine (P /H11005.0004). Not engaging in oral sex was a positive correlate of vaccine acceptance ( P/H11005 .045). Virgin men were most likely to be undecidedabout receiving the vaccine (P /H11005.028). No signif- icant correlates for vaccine acceptance were foundfor the type of contraception or protection used ora history of genital warts. Men's feelings and knowledge about HPV and the HPV vaccine were analyzed as correlates ofHPV vaccine acceptance (Table 3). Five variableswere found to be signicant correlates of vaccineacceptance, worry about vaccine side effects, con-cern about vaccine safety, the importance of gettingvaccines, familiarity with the HPV vaccine, and theimportance of getting the HPV vaccine. Men de-siring vaccination were more likely to be extremelyworried about vaccine side effects ( P/H11021.0001) and less likely to be not concerned at all about vaccinesafety (P /H11021.0001). Those men not worried about vaccine side effects or vaccine safety were mostlikely to be undecided about being vaccinated. Menwho feel it is extremely important to get vaccineswere also more likely to want the vaccine ( P/H11021 .0001). Greater familiarity ( /H11021.0001). Sim- ilarly, feeling it is extremely important to get theHPV vaccine positively correlated with desire to bevaccinated (P /H11021.0001). Factors that may affect men's willingness to re- ceive the HPV vaccine were also examined (Table4). Men were more willing to be vaccinated if theirdoctor recommended it (56.0%), if it was free(51.4%), and if research proved the vaccine will behelpful for men (50.7%). Other reasons are listed inTable 4. Discussion Men's correlates of HPV vaccine acceptance havenot been previously determined. Some may arguethat men do not need the HPV vaccine. Thesepeople may appreciate the burden of HPV diseasein women but fail to understand the magnitude ofHPV-related disease in men.

By preventing these potentially life-threaten- ing diseases and infections that produce signicantmorbidity, boys and men can live healthier lives. 19 Prophylactic vaccination may also reduce healthcare costs for men. Moreover, by vaccinating boysand men in addition to girls and women, societyand individuals benet from herd immunity. A gen-der-neutral vaccination program to prevent HPVmakes good sense. With respect to age, younger men were more likely to be undecided about receiving the HPVvaccine and older men were more likely to not wantthe HPV vaccine.

Women are probably more familiar with HPV be-cause of their frequent screening examinations forcervical cancer and the recent media publicityabout the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Like witholder mid-adult women, more older men see noneed for vaccination. 16 In general, more white men were undecided about vaccination and a greater percentage of blackmen were opposed to vaccination. However, com-pared with white men a greater percentage of blackmen wanted to receive the vaccine. We cannothonestly explain these ndings so must leave therationale to speculation. A greater amount of education correlated posi- tively with a desire to receive the HPV vaccine.Men with a higher level of formal education wereperhaps better able to understand their risk of in-fection and the importance of a prophylactic inter-vention. Although future HPV vaccine educationshould target all men, an emphasis on those with-out a college degree may be particularly benecial. Being single correlated positively with indeci- sion about receiving the vaccine. Although maritalTable 3.

Downloaded from status is somewhat irrelevant to all other vaccina- tion programs, we detected some hesitancy by un-married men. Reluctance at the present time isjustied given the lack of clinical trial data andapproval by the FDA. A global vaccination policyfor all boys, combined with ample education formen, may adequately address this current problemof indecision. Health behaviors were also examined as corre- lates for vaccine acceptance. Use of a seat belt mostof the time correlated positively with a desire forvaccination. Interestingly, men who wore seat beltsall the time were more likely to be undecided aboutvaccination. Perhaps those most cautious about au-tomobile safety were equally cautious about accept-ing a vaccine before reviewing safety and efcacydata in men. Men who used tobacco products reg-ularly were more likely to want the vaccine. Thisgroup response is particularly encouraging becausetobacco use has an adverse effect on the immunesystem's response to HPV infection. 20Smokers are less likely to clear HPV infection and have anincreased risk for cervical neoplasia. 21,22 Interesting correlates of vaccine acceptance were also seen when men's sexual history was examined.Men who were not currently sexually active weremore likely to want the HPV vaccine. However,male virgins were more likely to be undecidedabout vaccination. In the former case, nonvirginsnot currently sexually active perhaps were aware ofpotential risks and saw a window of opportunity tobe protected. Unfortunately, male virgins did notfully comprehend the ideal time to be vaccinatedwas before initiating a sexual relationship. Al-though this may not pose difculties for sexuallyna\u00efve young boys receiving the HPV vaccine, itidenties a special educational challenge for vacci-nating a catch-up population of male virgins. Menwith a history of more than 10 female sexual part-ners were also more likely to want the HPV vac-cine. Although this risk prole for potential exist-ing HPV minimizes the possibleattributes of the vaccine, these higher-risk menclearly appreciated the need for vaccination. Al-though not statistically signicant, the same trendwas noted for men who have sex with men. Menreporting 5 or fewer sexual partners were morelikely to be undecided about receiving the vaccine.Once again, much education will be necessary forthis population because vaccination would be morebenecial in this lower-risk group of men. Menwho had oral sex were more likely to be undecidedabout vaccination, but men who had not had oralsex were more likely to want the HPV vaccine. Nosignicant correlates were noted for a history ofvaginal and anal sex. The implications for thesetypes of sexual activity and desire to be vaccinatedare not completely understood. With respect tosexual frequency, men who never had sex weremore likely to be undecided about vaccination.Again, the virgins perhaps did not appreciate thesame urgency for vaccination as sexually experi-enced men. Several feelings toward all vaccines and the HPV vaccine and knowledge of HPV were found tocorrelate positively with HPV vaccine acceptance.Men who were extremely worried about vaccineside effects or extremely concerned about vaccinesafety were more likely to want the HPV vaccine.These same men may have been extremely con-cerned or worried about the risks of HPV infectionand, therefore, for them vaccination is preferable.Men who were not worried about the vaccine sideeffects nor concerned about vaccine safety weremore likely to be undecided about receiving theHPV vaccine. These aloof men could also benetfrom special education about receiving the HPVvaccine. Men who felt it extremely important to getvaccines, in general, also were most likely to wantthe HPV vaccine. This expected positive correla-tion helps to validate our survey. Those who felt itwas unimportant to get vaccines were most likely tobe undecided about HPV vaccination. Familiaritywith HPV also correlated signicantly with HPVvaccine acceptance. Men very familiar with HPVwere most likely to want the HPV vaccine. Simi-larly, those men not familiar with HPV were morelikely to be undecided about HPV vaccination.These data underscore the importance of educatingmen about HPV to insure a successful vaccine im-plementation program for men. As anticipated,men who felt it was extremely important to get theHPV vaccine were most likely to want to receivethe HPV vaccine. Thus, educational efforts mustconvey the importance of receiving the HPV vac-cine. When asked which factors would most influence men to receive the HPV vaccine, more than half ofthe men stated they would be more inclined toreceive the vaccine if recommended by a doctor.Parents of adolescents also indicated that a positiverecommendation by their health care providers was 40JABFM January-February 2009 Vol. 22 No. 1 http://www.jabfm.orgcopyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from the single most important factor in influencing them to vaccinate their children.23Half of the men stated they would be more inclined to be vaccinatedif research proved the vaccine to be helpful in men.With the absence of safety and efcacy data in men,availability of these data will be crucial to overallvaccine acceptance. Almost half of the men statedthat they would be more likely to receive the vac-cine if it were covered by insurance. The provisionof this preventive health care measure by the insur-ance industry will also help successful implementa-tion of the HPV vaccine among boys and men. Indescending order of importance, men were clearlymaking their decision at this time based on expertopinion, research-based safety and efcacy, and -nancial cost. Cost, as in all medical decisions, playsa role in the decision process. We assume the costfor vaccinating men would be the same as the cur-rent expense of vaccinating women. Whether pay-ers embrace HPV vaccination for men as readily asthey have nancial support for women is to bedetermined. This study was limited by perhaps several un- derrepresented populations of men, including oldermen, Asians and Hispanics, men without medicalinsurance, and non-high school graduates. Men ofcertain faiths, homosexual men, and divorced menwere also underrepresented. Other studies of thesegroups of men would be of value. Our trial found many interesting correlates for HPV vaccination acceptance, refusal, and indeci-sion. Men with greater general education, high-riskhealth behaviors, and knowledge about HPV aremore likely to want the HPV vaccine. Because ofthe rather high rate of uncertainty among men, theavailability of clinical research ndings and a fo-cused lay educational program should facilitateeven wider HPV vaccine acceptance by men.
