[reports Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/japan-experimental-alzheimers-vaccine-is-promising-1850700985): In preliminary research released this week, the vaccine appeared to reduce inflammation and other important biomarkers in the brains of mice with Alzheimer's-like illness, while also improving their awareness. More research will be needed before this vaccine can be tested in humans, however. The experimental vaccine is being developed primarily by scientists from Juntendo University in Japan. It's intended to work by training the immune system to go after certain [senescent cells](https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/does-cellular-senescence-hold-secrets-healthier-aging), aging cells that no longer divide to make more of themselves, but instead stick around in the body. These cells aren't necessarily harmful, and some play a vital role in healing and other life functions. But they've also been linked to a variety of age-related diseases, including Alzheimer's. The vaccine specifically targets senescent cells that produce high levels of something called senescence-associated glycoprotein, or SAGP. Other research has suggested that people with Alzheimer's tend to have brains filled with these cells in particular. The team tested their vaccine on mice bred to have brains that develop the same sort of gradual destruction seen in humans "}
