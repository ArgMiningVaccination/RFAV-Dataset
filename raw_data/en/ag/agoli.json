TITLE XI\u2014COMPASSIONATE COMMUNICATION ON HIPAA SEC. 11001. SENSE OF CONGRESS. (a) F INDINGS .\u2014Congress finds the following: (1) According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, in 2015, there were approximately 9,800,000 adults in the United States with serious mental illness. (2) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration defines the term ''serious mental illness'' as an illness affecting individuals 18 years of age or older as having, at any time in the past year, a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder that results in serious func-tional impairment and substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities. (3) In reporting on the incidence of serious mental illness, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra-tion includes major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental disorders that cause serious impairment. (4) Adults with a serious mental illness are at a higher risk for chronic physical illnesses and premature death. (5) According to the World Health Organization, adults with a serious mental illness have lifespans that are 10 to 25 years shorter than those without serious mental illness. The vast majority of these deaths are due to chronic physical medical conditions, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious diseases, as well as diabetes and hypertension. (6) According to the World Health Organization, the majority of deaths of adults with a serious mental illness that are due to physical medical conditions are preventable. (7) Supported decision making can facilitate care decisions in areas where serious mental illness may impact the capacity of an individual to determine a course of treatment while still allowing the individual to make decisions independently. (8) Help should be provided to adults with a serious mental illness to address their acute or chronic physical illnesses, make informed choices about treatment, and understand and follow through with appropriate treatment. VerDate Sep 11 2014 13:11 PUBLIC LAW 114-255\u2014DEC. 13, 2016 (9) There is confusion in the health care community regarding permissible practices under the regulations promul-gated under the Health Insurance Portability and Account-ability Act of 1996 (commonly known as ''HIPAA''). This confu-sion may hinder appropriate communication of health care information or treatment preferences with appropriate care-givers. (b) S ENSE OF CONGRESS .\u2014It is the sense of Congress that clarification is needed regarding the privacy rule promulgated under section 264(c) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 1320d-2 note) regarding existing permitted uses and disclosures of health information by health care profes-sionals to communicate with caregivers of adults with a serious mental illness to facilitate treatment.
