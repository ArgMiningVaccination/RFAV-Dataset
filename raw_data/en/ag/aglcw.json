Main points Respondents from the [COVID-19 Vaccine Opinions Study](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandchangingattitudestowardsvaccinationengland/7to16september2021)were able to write additional reasons, beyond those presented in multiple-selection lists, that had encouraged them, stopped them or would encourage them to get a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. Primary motivations among adults who decided to get vaccinated included \"protecting others or oneself\", \"regaining freedoms and rights\" and \"being influenced by others\". The main reasons for those who remained unvaccinated included \"feeling that the risks of a COVID-19 vaccine were too high or the benefits were too low\", \"distrusting or feeling discontent towards vaccine stakeholders\" such as the government and vaccine manufacturers, and \"lacking sufficient, trustworthy or favourable evidence on vaccine side effects, safety or effectiveness\". Unvaccinated adults reported \"having sufficient or trustworthy evidence on vaccine side effects, safety or effectiveness\" and \"feeling that the risks of a COVID-19 vaccine were lower or the benefits were higher\" as the main factors that would encourage them to have a vaccine in the future. Responses often included more than one theme, particularly those reporting barriers to vaccination, which suggests that the decision of whether to have a COVID-19 vaccine is complex. Some interventions to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as lockdowns and vaccine passports, encouraged some respondents to vaccinate but were a barrier to others. For some respondents, the barriers to vaccination were practical ones, such as having a disability or difficulty accessing a vaccination site. [Back to table of contents](#toc) 2. Overview of the study These are findings from qualitative analysis of free-text responses collected as part of the [COVID-19 Vaccine Opinions Study](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandchangingattitudestowardsvaccinationengland/7to16september2021) (VOS). VOS identified changes in uptake and attitudes towards coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines among adults in England who had taken part in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) between 13 January and 8 August 2021. It focused on adults who reported having declined a vaccine when offered, being unlikely to have it or unsure about having it if offered. Although there was a steady decline in this population over the same period from 10% to 3% of all adults, this research is important for understanding previously unvaccinated adults' motivations and barriers to vaccination. Respondents were asked to choose from multiple selection lists and select all the applicable reasons: that encouraged them to vaccinate if they had received a vaccine that had stopped them from getting a vaccine that would make them more likely to have a vaccine if they remained unvaccinated Respondents were also given the opportunity to write additional reasons into a free-text box. Free-text responses often included more than one theme, particularly those reporting barriers to vaccination, which suggests that the decision of whether to have a COVID-19 vaccine is complex. This research employed a new methodological approach that combines natural language processing techniques and thematic analysis to identify and analyse themes and sub-themes within the data. See [Data sources and quality](/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/articles/coronavirusandchangingperceptionstowardsvaccinationengland/7to16september2021#data-sources-and-quality) for more information about our methodology and sample characteristics. The main findings are from a qualitative analysis, so it is not possible to quantify their importance and they may not be generalisable to wider populations. Quotes represent respondents' views only.

Motivations for vaccination When asked about motivations for vaccination, the [Vaccine Opinions Study](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandchangingattitudestowardsvaccinationengland/7to16september2021) found the majority of adults reported that they had the first dose of a vaccine so that restrictions would ease and life would return to normal (65%), followed by wanting to protect themselves (61%) and others (57%) from coronavirus (COVID-19).

These clustered around seven themes: protecting others or oneself regaining freedoms and rights being influenced by others feeling pressured, coerced or stigmatised feeling reassured by evidence or professional advice doing \"the right thing\" trusting the medical establishment Protecting others or oneself The strongest theme was wanting to protect oneself and, in particular, other people. Respondents said they had a vaccine to protect vulnerable family members, friends, patients or clients. Female, 30 to 39 years Female, 40 to 49 years Others said they wanted to protect their unborn child while pregnant or baby while breastfeeding. Female, 30 to 39 years Among those who reported having a vaccine to protect themselves, specific motivations included having a pre-existing health condition or feeling at increased risk of catching COVID-19 at work. Female, 30 to 39 years Female, 30 to 39 years Others were concerned about preventing infection or reducing or resolving long COVID symptoms. Female, 30 to 39 years Male, 40 to 49 years Regaining freedoms and rights Avoiding restrictions and being able to \"return to normal\" was also a strong theme. Respondents said they had a vaccine to be able to engage in leisure activities, work or travel for work. Male, 18 to 29 years Female, 30 to 39 years Others also said they had a vaccine to be able to visit family members or friends. Female, 50 to 59 years Being able to have a particular vaccine brand was reported by few respondents, possibly because most people were not able to choose which vaccine they could have. Being influenced by others Being influenced by others, particularly family members or friends, was also reported as a reason to get vaccinated. Female, 30 to 39 years Only a minority of respondents said they had felt encouraged to get a vaccine by society in general, trusted public figures or community organisations, or the government or the NHS. However, about one-third (31%) of vaccinated respondents had selected \"wanting to protect the NHS and other healthcare workers\" from the presented list and may have not felt the need to mention it again in free-text responses. Feeling pressured, coerced or stigmatised Feeling forced or avoiding stigma was another reason to have a vaccine, particularly among those who also indicated they decided to get vaccinated to regain freedoms and rights. Respondents said they felt pressured by the government or media, or by family members or friends. Male, 30 to 39 years Female, 18 to 29 years Other respondents said they felt pressured by their employer, or others. Female, 30 to 39 years Female, 40 to 49 years Less frequently reported themes Some respondents said they had vaccinated after doing some research or seeking professional advice. Female, 40 to 49 years For others, doing \"the right thing\" was the main reason to vaccinate. Female, 60 to 69 years A minority of respondents had vaccinated because they trusted vaccines, the medical establishment or both. Male, 40 to 49 years A full list of themes and sub-themes identified, and additional illustrative quotes can be found in the [accompanying data](/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/datasets/coronavirusandchangingperceptionstowardsvaccinationengland).

[Back to table of contents](#toc) 4. Barriers to vaccination When asked about barriers to vaccination, the [Vaccine Opinions Study](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandchangingattitudestowardsvaccinationengland/7to16september2021) (VOS) found that the majority of adults reported being worried about side effects (58%), feeling that the vaccine had been developed too quickly (55%) and being worried about the long-term effects on their health (54%). Figure 2: Being worried about side effects was the most common reason for not having a COVID-19 vaccine Main barriers to vaccination among adults who remained unvaccinated, England, 7 to 16 September 2021 Source: Office for National Statistics - COVID-19 Vaccine Opinions Study Notes: Respondents were able to select more than one option.

Some of these reasons were new and others were in-depth descriptions of the barriers they had selected from the presented list (Figure 2). These also clustered around seven themes: feeling that the risks of a COVID-19 vaccine were too high, or the benefits were too low distrusting or feeling discontent towards vaccine stakeholders lacking sufficient, trustworthy or favourable evidence on vaccine side effects, safety or effectiveness perceiving COVID-19 as low-risk to self feeling pressured or coerced worldview-related barriers practical barriers Feeling that the risks of a COVID-19 vaccine were too high, or the benefits were too low The strongest theme around barriers to COVID-19 vaccination was the perception that having a vaccine was too risky or its benefits were too low. Concerns about vaccine side effects were often reiterated in free-text responses, in line with the main reasons given in the survey. This suggests that the perceived risks of COVID-19 vaccines were a key barrier. Specifically, respondents were worried about long-term or severe side effects (for example, allergic reactions or blood clots). Female, 40 to 49 years Others were concerned about vaccine effects on fertility, pregnancy or breastfeeding, or on pre-existing health conditions, such as long COVID. Female, 40 to 49 years Male, 50 to 59 years Some were worried about how side effects might impact their ability to work or care for children, or had experienced side effects from other vaccines. Male, 30 to 39 years Female, 50 to 59 years The \"emergency approval\" of COVID-19 vaccines and their \"rushed development\" were also cited as areas of concern, particularly regarding mRNA vaccines or the use of ingredients that were perceived to be unsafe. Male, 40 to 49 years The benefits of COVID-19 vaccines were often questioned by the same respondents who expressed concern about their risks. They felt vaccines were inadequate at preventing COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation or death. Male, 40 to 49 years Distrusting or feeling discontent towards vaccine stakeholders Another strong theme was distrust of, or discontent with, those encouraging vaccine take up, with negative opinion generally directed at the government. Distrusting or disagreeing with COVID-19 policy, both in the UK and internationally, was a common barrier. This distrust covered several aspects such as interventions to stop the spread of COVID-19 and focus on policies to control the coronavirus pandemic above other priorities. Female, 30 to 39 years Female, 30 to 39 years Male, 50 to 59 years Long-term distrust in government and politicians was also reported. Previous medical controversies or scandals, particularly the use of Thalidomide in pregnant women, were also given as reasons for distrusting government. Male, 30 to 39 years The perception that government was silencing or ignoring dissenting scientists was also mentioned by a few respondents. Female, 70 years and over Some felt the media was censoring dissenting voices and uncritically echoing messages from government or the World Health Organisation about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Male, 70 years and over Other respondents reported feelings of distrust toward vaccine manufacturers, particularly around pharmaceutical companies previously being taken to court for malpractice or not being liable for COVID-19 vaccines' adverse outcomes. Male, 30 to 39 years The perceptions that vaccine manufacturers were not being transparent in reporting data from COVID-19 vaccines' clinical trials or were profiting from vaccinations were also reported. Lacking sufficient, trustworthy or favourable evidence on vaccine side effects, safety or effectiveness The perceived lack of long-term evidence about the effects of COVID-19 vaccination was a primary concern, with respondents saying they wanted to wait for this data to become available to make an informed decision. Male, 60 to 69 years Some suggested that information about others' negative vaccination experiences had stopped them from having a vaccine. Female, 60 to 69 years Others said that unfavourable evidence, reportedly from scientists, medical professionals, prominent podcasters or radio hosts was a barrier. Male, 70 years and over Other evidence-related barriers to vaccination included: lack of balanced information insufficient evidence on the side effects for healthy people or those with chronic health conditions insufficient data on vaccine effectiveness against different variants difficulty accessing data Perceiving COVID-19 as low-risk to self Respondents mentioned several reasons why they were not concerned about COVID-19. These included feeling fit and healthy and the belief that COVID-19 does not cause severe enough disease to justify mass vaccination. Male, 18 to 29 years Male, 50 to 59 years Other reasons were using alternative protection measures, having experienced mild COVID-19 disease or acquiring immunity because of previous infection. Female, 60 to 69 years Male, 18 to 29 years Feeling pressured or coerced Some respondents mentioned that feeling pressured or coerced discouraged them from getting vaccinated. The government was identified as the main source of this pressure. The prospect of vaccine passports was frequently mentioned and associated with \"bullying\" and \"manipulation\". In particular, concern was raised about the use of vaccine passports to control international travel or access to certain events, or to work in certain sectors, such as healthcare. Female, 18 to 29 years Female, 50 to 59 years Others were concerned about incentives offered to get vaccinated, which were perceived as \"bribery\". Female, 18 to 29 years Giving vaccines to some children without parental consent was also mentioned as a concern. Female, 40 to 49 years Worldview-related barriers Barriers relating to the respondent's views of the world were reported less frequently than other themes but were varied. The main barrier within this theme was the belief that natural immunity is more effective than vaccination. Male, 70 years or older Other barriers were: a preference for alternative approaches, which have proven to be ineffective in preventing or treating COVID-19 COVID-19 denial or anti-system sentiment ethical or religious objections, including objections to the use of animal trials during the development of vaccines being against all vaccines or healthcare in general vaccine equity (for example, believing other countries should be vaccinated first) or altruism Practical barriers Practical barriers were also less frequently reported by respondents, yet they were usually mentioned as the sole reason preventing vaccine uptake. The main barrier was lack of support or special arrangements for phobias or anxiety. Female, 18 to 29 years Other barriers included: location of or access to a vaccination centre being unable to choose the vaccine brand lack of time to attend a vaccination appointment difficulty in booking a vaccination appointment delaying vaccination because of recent COVID-19 infection not being able to get a GP appointment to discuss the effects of a vaccine on pre-existing health conditions A full list of themes and sub-themes identified, and additional illustrative quotes can be found in [accompanying data](/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/datasets/coronavirusandchangingperceptionstowardsvaccinationengland). [Back to table of contents](#toc) 5. Potential motivations for vaccination Respondents who remained unvaccinated were also asked about what would make them more likely to have a vaccine. The [Vaccine Opinions Study](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandchangingattitudestowardsvaccinationengland/7to16september2021) found that wanting to protect themselves or others from coronavirus (COVID-19) were the most selected reasons (19% for both). However, compared with motivations for and barriers to vaccination, a high proportion also selected \"none of the above\" to the reasons listed. Therefore, free-text responses were particularly useful in shedding light on what would encourage unvaccinated adults to get a vaccine. Figure 3: Protecting themselves or others were the most common reasons that would motivate unvaccinated adults to get a vaccine Main potential motivations for vaccination among adults who remained unvaccinated, England, 7 to 16 September 2021 Source: Office for National Statistics - COVID-19 Vaccine Opinions Study Notes: Respondents were able to select more than one option. Only the most common reasons are presented and some response options have been shortened for clarity. For full wording and estimates for all response options see [the data tables](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fhealthandsocialcare%2fhealthandwellbeing%2fdatasets%2fcoronavirusandvaccineattitudesinengland%2f7to16september2021/vosreferencetables09112021new.xlsx). Base: unvaccinated adults who had previously declined a vaccine when offered, said they were unlikely to have it if offered or said they were unsure about having it if offered.

The identified themes, therefore, broadly mirrored those described in the previous section and are not discussed in-depth here. The strongest theme was having sufficient or trustworthy evidence on vaccine side effects, safety or effectiveness from \"conventional\" clinical trials (for example, lengthier studies) and vaccine rollout. Male, 50 to 59 years Another strong theme was feeling that the risks of a COVID-19 vaccine were lower or the benefits were higher: Male, 30 to 39 years Being able to trust vaccine stakeholders was mentioned by some as a potential motivation to vaccinate. Others would vaccinate if COVID-19 became a higher risk to themselves or others because of increased susceptibility (for example, aging) or more severe variants. This finding improves our understanding of the specific reasons that would encourage adults to protect themselves or others from COVID-19 in the future, both of which were the most chosen potential motivations from the multiple-selection list. Less frequently reported themes were improving access to the vaccine, being asked or mandated to vaccinate and worldview-related reasons, such as banning animal testing during vaccine development. A full list of themes and sub-themes identified, and additional illustrative quotes can be found in [accompanying data](/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/datasets/coronavirusandchangingperceptionstowardsvaccinationengland).

Glossary Vaccinated \"Vaccinated\" refers to those who reported in the OPN that they had previously declined the first dose of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, were unlikely to have it or unsure about having it, but then decided to get vaccinated and self-reported having a vaccine. Unvaccinated \"Unvaccinated\" refers to those who reported in the OPN that they had previously declined the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, were unlikely to have it or unsure about having it, and self-reported that they remained unvaccinated, excluding those waiting for an appointment to be vaccinated.

Data sources and quality This release is supplementary to [Coronavirus and changing attitudes towards vaccination, England: 7 to 16 September 2021](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandchangingattitudestowardsvaccinationengland/7to16september2021) and provides data from free-text responses. The Vaccine Opinions Study (VOS) was commissioned and funded by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to gain insight into changes in attitudes and uptake towards coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines among adults in England, and the reasons behind those changes. The VOS questionnaire was designed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in consultation with the DHSC, NHS England and NHS improvement. VOS respondents were adults who had taken part in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) over the period 13 January to 8 August 2021 and had previously: been offered a vaccine but did not get vaccinated reported being \"very or fairly unlikely\" to have a vaccine if offered responded \"neither likely nor unlikely\", \"don't know\" or \"prefer not to say\" to the question \"if a vaccine for the coronavirus (COVID-19) was offered to you, how likely or unlikely would you be to have the vaccine?\" The VOS sample contained 2,482 individuals, who were surveyed between 7 and 16 September 2021. Over 4 in 10 (44%) were now vaccinated, while 55% remained unvaccinated. A high proportion of unvaccinated respondents provided free-text responses about what had discouraged them to vaccinate (40%). About one in five vaccinated respondents (22%) and unvaccinated respondents (19%) described what had motivated them or would make them more likely to have a vaccine, Caribbean Download this table Table 1: Sample characteristics of adults who responded to the Vaccine Opinions Study, 7 to 16 September 2021 [.xls](/download/table?format=xlsx&uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/articles/coronavirusandchangingperceptionstowardsvaccinationengland/7to16september2021/59fd4230.json) [.csv](/download/table?format=csv&uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/articles/coronavirusandchangingperceptionstowardsvaccinationengland/7to16september2021/59fd4230.json) Data analysis Free-text responses were initially analysed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify patterns in the data and cluster similar responses into topics or themes. Three techniques were considered: topic modelling, word embedding and part-of-speech tagging. However, topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) proved to be the most useful. Responses were separated into sentences, which the LDA model allocated into one of ten topics. The number of topics used was determined qualitatively by looking at the similarity and coherence of the topics produced by the LDA model. The aim of this procedure is to ensure that topics make sense and are sufficiently different from each other. Topics were then reviewed for accuracy and inductive thematic analysis, a bottom-up approach whereby themes emerge from the data themselves, was used to refine the data groupings and identify themes and sub-themes. We then undertook a quality assurance review of the analysis by recoding 10% of the sentences in each topic, to ensure the responses were correctly classified within each theme and the quotes selected were representative of their theme. Quotations have been used throughout the article to illustrate themes identified in the analysis. All survey responses were anonymous and any potentially identifying information has been removed from the quotations. Given that this is a qualitative dataset, socio-demographic differences in the reporting of motivations and barriers to vaccination were not evaluated. For more information on the motivations and barriers to COVID-19 vaccination by characteristics including age, sex and ethnicity, see [Coronavirus and changing attitudes towards vaccination, England: 7 to 16 September 2021](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandchangingattitudestowardsvaccinationengland/7to16september2021). Strengths and limitations Strengths Targeting a \"hard to reach\" group (those who declined, were unlikely to have or unsure about having a vaccine), achieved by using a sample of adults who have taken part in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) and agreed to take part in future research. Respondents did not need to recall their previous vaccine behaviour or intention, as this information was collected via the initial OPN. The questionnaire was developed with customer consultation, and design expertise was applied in the development stages. Quality assurance procedures were undertaken throughout the analysis stages to minimise the risk of error. Respondents used free-text boxes to report other motivations and barriers to vaccination beyond those presented in the multiple-selection lists, but also more detailed information about the reasons respondents had chosen from these lists, both of which improve our understanding about the reasons underpinning COVID-19 vaccination behaviour. Limitations There is limited comparability or coherence with other data sources as this is a \"hard to reach\" group. Responses reflect the views of those who were motivated to report other reasons for having or not having a vaccine and write their views, so they may not represent the full range of perspectives from the VOS sample. There was no cognitive testing of the questions because of time restrictions, which may lead to misinterpretation of questions by respondents. NLP is a useful method to aid the analysis of large qualitative datasets, but it is less accurate when categorising a relatively small number of responses; therefore, combining NLP with thematic analysis is necessary to ensure the data are adequately categorised. Previously self-reported vaccination behaviour or intention may have been influenced by when respondents were offered the vaccine and when they took part in the OPN. Findings are linked to factors that have changed, such as available information or extent of vaccine rollout, and so related vaccine perceptions and associated behaviour may have also changed.
