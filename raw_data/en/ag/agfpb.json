[(What if I don't have an Ontario Health Card or photo ID?)](/en/public-health-topics/sexual-health-clinic.aspx#What-if-I-dont-have-an-Ontario-Health-Card) Each client receives a number, which will be used to identify you during your visit. Please note that clients may not always be seen in numerical order. Each person is here for a different reason. We have various health care practitioners who perform different roles. You will be seen as close to your appointment time as possible by the next available practitioner who can address the reason for your visit. An appointment may take up to one hour depending on the services needed. The visit may include an assessment, on-site testing, blood work and treatment. |The interview | |When your number is called you will be seen by a health care practitioner, such as a nurse, doctor or nurse practitioner who will ask you a series of questions, including: | - the reason for your visit - contact information - medical and sexual history The information you share will be used to determine the type of services that may be beneficial to you. During this time, the health care practitioner may provide you with information about STBBI (sexually transmitted and blood borne infections), safer sex and birth control options. This is also your opportunity to ask any questions you have about sex or sexual health and to voice your concerns. |The assessment: | |After your interview, if an exam is required you will see a doctor or nurse practitioner. | During the exam, the doctor or nurse practitioner may do a number of tests depending on your assessment, whether you have symptoms and your risk for sexually transmitted infections. |Testing: | | | The clinic can test for several types of STBBI (sexually transmitted and blood borne infections). Most infections have a \"window period\" before they can be detected. The table below summarizes how we conduct our most common tests, and the window periods associated with each infection. Based on your sexual history, the health care practitioner will determine what type of testing is appropriate at the time of your visit. Tests conducted at the Sexual Health Clinic | | Infection | | Testing | | Window period | | Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea | | Urine sample, swab of the cervix, vagina, throat or rectum | | Testing can be done at the time of presentation | | Syphilis | | Blood test | | Four to six weeks after a sexual contact | | HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) | | Blood test | | Six to 12 weeks after potential risk | | Results: | | It can take up to three weeks for results to come back from the lab. If you do not hear from us, test results are NEGATIVE. Please do not call the clinic for results. If you would like to review your results or get a copy, after 3 weeks have passed, please visit us in person during clinic hours and bring photo ID. If a test is positive (which means your test showed you have an infection) you will be contacted by a Public Health Nurse about treatment and may be asked for information about your sexual partners. This information will be used to contact these partners to ensure that they are tested and treated. All information will be kept confidential. Your name will not be given to these partners.
