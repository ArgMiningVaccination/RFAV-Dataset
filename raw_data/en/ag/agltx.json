Naturopathic Medicine combines the art and knowledge of traditional healing with the diagnostic tools of modern medical science. The overarching premise of Naturopathy is to maintain health and prevent the onset of disease. However, should a person's health be compromised, the Naturopathic Physician relies on five principles which provide the foundation for assisting the person in restoring and maintaining vibrant health. Naturopathic Medicine Services We Offer: There are three types of testing that are involved in uncovering food allergies or sensitivities as a possible cause for underlying disease or dysfunction. Each test involves evaluating the blood for various reactions within the immune system. Genetic testing can be done to identify the two markers for developing the auto-immune disease known as Celiac Disease, which are HLA-DQ2 and HLA- DQ8. Research tells us that more than 95% of patients with celiac disease have one of these genetic markers. Another immune response in celiac disease and many other food allergies involves the production of antibodies. IgG or IgA antibodies may cause a delayed immune reaction that can occur anywhere from one to 72 hours after a food is ingested. The symptoms may include digestive upset, migraines, asthma, psoriasis, eczema, anxiety, depression, joint or muscle pain, sinus congestion and many, many other symptoms. The third type of testing is done exclusively through ALCAT Laboratories. It is a blood test that is used to reveal a cellular immune response to the ingestion of many common foods, as well as medicinal herbs, environmental chemicals, food additives/colorings, molds, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents. We are excited to offer this type of testing at Namaste Health Center because it allows us to recognize offending foods and chemicals that would not be evident on other types of allergy testing. For more information see [www.alcat.com.](http://www.alcat.com) Your hormone system is like a complex orchestra involving many glands and hormones. If one hormone is out of balance, over time it can cause other hormones to also be out of balance which can ultimately cause a multitude of symptoms. If you have tried to treat symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, depression, PMS or hot flashes and still don't feel well, it may be time to test your hormones! Hormones are the chemical messengers that travel throughout the bloodstream to every organ and tissue in the body. Some hormones are appropriate to test in the blood, like thyroid and insulin, while others are secreted in small bursts throughout the day. For this reason, a 24 hour urine collection or saliva sample may be better for looking at adrenal hormones like cortisol and DHEA or male and female sex hormones such as estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. A 24-hour urine hormone test looks at downstream metabolites of hormones to provide insight into your risk for developing breast or prostate cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, heart disease and other diseases associated with aging. These hormone imbalances may be easily corrected with dietary changes, herbs and supplements or in some cases, bio-identical hormones. History Having an ancient origin, this treatment was further developed and perfected by the Naturopathic doctor Dr. O.G. Carroll (1879-1962). Known as the \"busiest health practitioner of any persuasion\" during the 1930s - 1940s, Dr. Carroll's practice centered around this treatment. The practice and principles have been carried on through the succeeding works of Drs. John Bastyr, Harold Dick, Leo Scott, and Bill Carroll. This treatment has since been used by thousands of practitioners for almost a century. It was at one time a standard treatment in hospitals and clinics. Goals and Principles One principle of Naturopathic Hydrotherapy is that health and healing are proportional to the normal flow of healthy blood. This relates specifically to quality as well as quantity of flow throughout the body. The goal is to increase flow through the organs of elimination (skin, liver, lungs, kidneys, colon) to increase the quality of blood by eliminating metabolic waste. The effects of this simple therapy of alternating hot and cold towels maximize the distribution of oxygen and nutrients, enhance immune response, improve digestion, and restores nervous equilibrium. Benefits This technique greatly improves recovery from many acute and chronic illnesses by stimulating the body's healing forces. Examples of acute conditions benefitted by NCH include bronchitis, asthma, colds, cases of flu, cough, headaches, sinus infections and digestive complaints. Chronic conditions that benefit from repeated treatment include asthma/bronchitis, heart disease, digestion issues ie: IBS and Crohn's disease, effects of cancer treatment, autoimmune conditions, arthritis, stress/anxiety, fatigue, circulation/metabolic issues, and environmental toxicity. Studies recently done at the National College of Naturopathic Medicine determined that constitutional hydrotherapy will raise a low basal body temperature, moderate low or high blood sugar, and moderate high or low blood pressure. Remarkably, an increase in white blood cell count by 10,000 more cells on average in circulation is seen within 2 to 8 hours after only 1 treatment. This is a rapid way to boost your immune function and fight any infection. What to Expect Hot towels are applied to the chest and abdomen in several layers. When the body and skin are sufficiently warm, the hot towels are replaced with a thin cool towel that is covered with layers of wool blankets. The body quickly warms the towel, and during this phase, low-volt massage currents may be used. A dry phase with electrical stimulation to the abdomen and back area follows. The hot, cold and warming towel phases will be repeated on the back. The treatment lasts approximately 45-60 minutes. Treatments are adjusted to the individual's needs and comforts. In order to discover the underlying cause of disease or dysfunction, we utilize modern laboratory tests to assist in our diagnosis. These may include many of the same tests that are ordered by conventional doctors, such as a CBC (Complete Blood Count), CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel), thyroid, and cholesterol levels. However, as naturopathic doctors, we are trained to not just look for lab values that are out of the range, but to recognize overall trends that could indicate imbalances that could possibly lead to disease in the future. In addition to routine blood testing, naturopathic doctors may also utilize other methods to aid in diagnosing disease, including salivary and urine hormone testing, heavy metal toxicity, food sensitivity testing, and comprehensive digestive analysis. A Digital THERMOGRAM is a heat-sensing camera that develops a color image on a computer screen, based upon temperature differentials on the surface of any area of the body. A woman imaging her breasts simply has to stand or sit in front of the camera, and within 12 seconds an image appears on the computer. It doesn't have physical contact with the body and doesn't introduce ionizing radiation into the body, as is done during Mammographic Imaging (which some people believe can provoke a malignancy to form). Contact our office for the next scheduled round of thermography in Durango. Women's wellness exams at Namaste Health Center focus on mental, emotional, and physical components influencing women's bodies. Our women's wellness exams take 1-hour and include a pelvic exam, Pap test, breast exam, and an in-depth interview with our Naturopathic Doctor. Our women's wellness treatment plans are based on holistic, nature-based approaches for a variety of women's gynecological issues. The women's wellness exam offers the following health services: How to prepare for your women's health visit: Please do not douche, engage in intercourse, or insert anything in your vagina 24 hours before your pelvic exam. It is best if you are not having your menstrual period for some types of visits. Checkups for gynecological concerns will usually require a pelvic exam. "}
