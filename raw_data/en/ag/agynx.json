But some formulas, like [Amrit Kalash](https://www.mapi.com/products/amrit-kalash-ambrosia), benefit just about everyone. This antioxidant-rich herbal tablet and paste duo is revered in Ayurveda as \"Queen of the Rasayanas.\" According to the ancient texts, rasayanas are foods, herbs, and behaviors that enhance health, happiness, and longevity.

Amrit Kalash Benefits: Super Antioxidant, Brain is a time-honored, synergistic Ayurvedic formula of herbs that nourish the mind, brain, and nerves while increasing vitality and inner strength.

These, and more, rare herbs and fruits come together to make the herbal masterpiece that is Amrit. How Amrit's Made\u2014An Authentic, Traditional Process The process of making [Amrit](https://mapi.com/products/amrit-nectar-paste-570-g) hasn't changed since those ancient times when only a few select vaidyas knew the formula. Today, it is still prepared in accordance with the instructions in the traditional texts and passed down by generations of Ayurvedic physicians. This complex formula takes 250 meticulous steps to prepare. Twenty-two pounds of raw ingredients are required to produce a single jar of our Amrit Nectar. The herbs are slow-cooked with care to protect the vital nutrients from high temperatures. This precise adherence to tradition and detail ensures that you get an authentic product of unparalleled quality. The Origins of Amrit: \"The Nectar of Immortality\" The ancient Vedic texts tell a story by the name of Samudra Manthan, \"The Churning of the Ocean.\" So the story goes, humanity was steeped in suffering in ancient times. The Devas (gods) and Asuras (demons), got together to find a solution for the crisis. Together, they churned the mighty ocean and Amrit Kalash\u2014the Nectar of Immortality\u2014appeared. With this precious gift, all of humanity recovered its health and happiness. Fast forward many millennia to the 1980s, another time of societal growth and turmoil. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, our company's founder, gathered India's top Ayurvedic scholars and physicians to see what could be done to alleviate people's suffering. One of the first things to emerge from these collective sessions was a powerful rasayana to nourish mind, body, and spirit in a very holistic and balanced way. For that reason, Maharishi decided to name the formula Amrit Kalash. What Science Says About Amrit Kalash Chemical analysis shows that Amrit contains an abundance of [phytochemicals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/phytochemical)\u2014natural chemicals from plants\u2014that help to protect against disease and have many other beneficial properties, including strong antioxidant power: - Polyphenols - Bioflavonoids - Vitamin C - Vitamin E - Beta carotene - Catechin - Tannic acid - Resveratrol Polyphenols are free radical scavengers and chelators of damaging metal ions. They include both water-soluble and lipid-soluble antioxidants, and can regenerate vitamins C and E. Bioflavonoids are a group of polyphenols with the highest antioxidant power. These potent free radical scavengers have been shown to [help lower LDL cholesterol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32441543/) and increase HDL cholesterol. They also help combat LDL oxidation. Vitamin C helps enhance immune function. Your body does not produce it, so it must be obtained from foods or food supplements. Vitamin E is called \"the anti-aging antioxidant\" and helps combat lipid peroxidation in the brain. Resveratrol is a polyphenol with potent antioxidant properties. It helps protect LDL cholesterol from oxidation and prevents platelet aggregation. What the Ancient Texts Say The oldest existing Indian medical text, Charaka Samhita, lavishes high praise on this traditional formulation, listing the following qualities: - It enhances longevity. - It boosts memory. - It sharpens the intellect. - It lends a glow and aura to the skin. - It improves the quality of the voice. - It makes speech more effective. - It increases the stamina of the senses. - It keeps the body and the mind youthful. What Vaidyas (Ayurvedic physicians) Say - Amrit promotes bala, or vital strength, that helps the body fight back disease. - It nourishes the seven tissues (dhatus) \u2014 nutritional fluid, blood, muscle, fat, bone, bone marrow and reproductive fluid. - Amrit balances the three ayurvedic principles of [Vata](https://www.mapi.com/ayurvedic-knowledge/doshas/vata.html), [Pitta](https://www.mapi.com/ayurvedic-knowledge/doshas/pitta.html)and [Kapha](https://www.mapi.com/ayurvedic-knowledge/doshas/kapha.html), which govern vital activities of the mind and body, right from circulation and digestion to respiration and emotions. - Amrit boosts all three mental abilities recognized in Ayurveda: dhi \u2014 learning; dhriti \u2014 retention; and smriti \u2014 recall. What Physicians Say Here are just a few of the things contemporary physicians are saying about Amrit Kalash: \"The incredible thing about Amrit is that it helps promote that state of restful alertness, which is the exact opposite of tense and tired. That is, it allows for clarity on the level of the mind and that deep rest on the level of the body.\" \u2014John Peterson, MD, Family Medicine \"Amrit nourishes the physiology deep inside. Every cell in the body is suffused with the potent energy of the herbs that make up Amrit. So, instead of identifying a symptom and trying to handle it, Amrit strengthens the entire system. And that's why it can work on the digestive system, immunity, the brain, etc.\" \u2014Steven Thibault, MD, Family Medicine \"Amrit works because it targets an area of physiology that's overlooked often in Western medicine, and that's the importance of digestion. It allows the proper transformation of food into bodily tissue. Without this mechanism being proper, the body builds up toxins, and the immune system has to work in overdrive to eliminate these toxins and often gets overwhelmed.\" \u2014Paul Dugliss, MD, Internal Medicine \"Amrit is the best, the premier antioxidant that anyone could use. Many of them say they notice right away that they feel better. More energy, clearer mind, minor aches and pains are better, and they feel more flexible in their physiology.\" \u2014Dr. John Zamarra, MD, Cardiology What the Research Says The [research](/blogs/research) on Amrit is now substantial. Hari Sharma, M.D., professor emeritus and former director of cancer prevention and natural products research at The Ohio State University College of Medicine, decided to put Amrit to the test. His team set out to compare Amrit with three individual antioxidants: Vitamin C, Vitamin E and the well-researched drug probucol. Their findings were dramatic. Weight for weight, the aqueous extracts of Amrit were several hundred times more potent than Vitamins C and E and probucol. The alcoholic extracts were even stronger: at least 1,000 times more potent. The antioxidant properties of Amrit inhibit degenerative processes, including abnormal platelet aggregation (clotting, leading to cardiovascular disease) and the aging process. More Research Findings In addition to the benefits we've already covered, Amrit helps to keep arteries clear by decreasing free radical damage to LDL cholesterol, helping to maintain the health and proper functioning of the heart and the entire cardiovascular system. Amrit also significantly reduces free radical damage in the brain, combating toxic stress and nourishing the mind's natural capabilities. Additionally, Amrit increases the response of lymphocyte immune cells by 300% to 400%. It also improves the functioning of macrophage immune cells, strengthening the body's immune response. In one study, Amrit was shown to reduce organ damage caused by toluene, a harmful chemical. Among [chemotherapy patients](https://mapi.com/blogs/research/antioxidant-adjuvant-therapy-using-natural-herbal-mixtures-mak-4-and-mak-5), research indicates that Amrit helps contain anorexia and vomiting.
