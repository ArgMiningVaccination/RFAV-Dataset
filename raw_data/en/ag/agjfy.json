It is composed of three amino acids - cysteine, glycine, and glutamate - and is produced naturally in the human body. It's also known as [GSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) for short. Glutathione can also be taken as a supplement to support healthy immune function, improve skin health, and other health benefits. However, it is important to understand the safe dosage levels and potential side effects of taking glutathione supplements before you start taking them. Benefits of Glutathione Glutathione has been used to treat a wide range of medical conditions for many years, but recently, more people are turning to glutathione supplements and intravenous (IV) therapy to improve their overall health. By increasing levels of glutathione, patients can expect numerous health benefits including improved immune system function, anti-aging effects, and detoxification. Skin Whitening Help fight off free radicals in the body which may lead to chronic inflammation, cell damage, or even cancer over time. Boost immunity Improve heart health Reduce cholesterol levels Prevent plaque buildup in arteries Reduce Oxidative Stress Can Improve Skin Psoriasis Safe Dosage: Recommended Intake Ensuring a safe dosage of glutathione is essential for those who are taking the supplement to reap its benefits. Glutathione is an antioxidant naturally produced by the body, and it helps reduce oxidative stress in cells. The optimal intake of glutathione varies among individuals depending on their health status, but there are general guidelines available for safe use. The recommended daily dose of glutathione for adults ranges from 500-2,000 mg per day when taken orally, or 10-20 mg/kg body weight when administered intravenously (IV). To maximize its effects, it is best to split up doses rather than take a single large dose each day. Before starting any supplementation regimen with glutathione, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider about potential risks and side effects that could arise from taking excessive amounts over time. Side Effects: Unexpected Reactions Despite its numerous benefits, glutathione can have unexpected side effects if taken in too high of doses or if it interacts with certain medications. Glutathione supplements are widely available over-the-counter as well as through prescription drugs. However, excessive intake of glutathione can lead to digestive issues such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, skin rashes or itching, and difficulty breathing. It may also cause headaches and dizziness due to the rapid changes in blood pressure levels associated with large doses of the supplement. Additionally, glutathione can increase one's heart rate and interact with other drugs like antacids or steroids which can cause serious adverse reactions from drug interactions. In rare cases, people may even suffer from an allergic reaction to glutathione supplements that could result in life-threatening symptoms like swelling of the throat or tongue. Dietary Sources: Foods That Contain Glutathione Getting sufficient amounts of glutathione from dietary sources is essential for optimal health. There are several foods that are good sources of glutathione, including - Fruits and Vegetables such as avocados, kale, garlic cloves, spinach, oranges, and strawberries - Cruciferous Vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts - Legumes such as beans, lentils, and chickpeas - Nuts like almonds and walnuts - Fish such as salmon, sardines, and tuna - Eggs - Dairy products such as yogurt and milk - Meats including beef liver; seeds like flaxseeds and chia seeds - Grains including quinoa and wheat germ 3 ways to supplement with Glutathione Whether you decide to use Glutathione orally, through [Liposomal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6389332/), or through an Intravenous Injection, the benefits, and efficacy that triggers skin whitening or other health benefits that you get are just the same regardless of the methods of supplementation. The only difference between these methods is through absorption, applicability, and practicality. Key Takeaways: A Vitamin-Rich IV Therapy In conclusion, glutathione IV therapy dosage is an effective way to improve health and overall well-being. This treatment can help reduce inflammation, boost energy levels, and improve mental clarity. Additionally, it can provide antioxidant support and help restore cellular function.
