The Group operates in a highly competitive market and failure to successfully compete with competitors could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business. The Group's success depends on its ability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences and a failure to adapt its strategy appropriately may have a material adverse effecton the Group's business and/or financial condition. The Group's business results are impacted by the Group's ability to manage disruptions in the Group's global supply chain and a failure to manage disruptions appropriately may have amaterial adverse effect on the Group's business and/or financial condition. Increasing dependence on key retail customers, changes in the policies of the Group's retail customers, the emergence of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changing retaillandscape may materially and adversely affect the Group's business. The Group may not be able to develop and commercialise new products effectively, which may materially and adversely affect the results of the Group's operations and financial condition. Failure to retain key personnel or attract new personnel may materially and adversely affect the Group's business. Damage to the Group's reputation could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business. Failure to respond effectively to the challenges raised by climate change and other sustainability matters may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business and resultsof operations. The Group's business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in all the markets in which it operates, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business operations andfinancial condition. The Group faces risks relating to the regulation and perception of the ingredients it uses in its products, which could materially and adversely impact the Group's business, prospects,financial condition and results of operations. The Group's business is subject to market fluctuations and general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, each of which may materially and adversely affect the Group'sbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The Group may fail to realise any or all of the anticipated benefits of the Demerger and Separation. 12 3. KEY INFORMATION ON THE SECURITIES 3.1 What are the main features of the securities?(A) Type, class and ISIN of the securities The Haleon Shares are fully paid ordinary shares in the capital of the Company with a nominal value of \u00a31.25 each (to be reduced to 1 pence following the Capital Reduction). On Admission, the Haleon Shares will be registered with an ISIN of GB00BMX86B70 and SEDOL of BMX86B7. It is expected that the Haleon Shares will be traded on the main marketfor listed securities of the London Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"HLN\". (B) Currency of the securities The Haleon Shares are and, on Admission will be, denominated in Pounds Sterling. (C) Number of issued and fully paid securities Immediately following completion of the Demerger, the number of Haleon Shares in issue will be equal to the number of GSK Shares in issue at the Shareholder Record Time. As at theLatest Practicable Date, there were 5,084,048,734 GSK Shares in issue (excluding ordinaryshares held in treasury). Shortly after completion of the Demerger, the following share-for-share exchanges will occur: (i) GSK will transfer its entire holding of GSKCHH B Ordinary Shares, representing an 8.01 per cent. stake in GSKCHH's ordinary share capital, tothe Company in exchange for 502,868,434 Haleon Shares, less a number ofHaleon Shares that is equal to the number of Excess GSK Shares. As at theLatest Practicable Date, the number of Haleon Shares expected to be held byGSK at Admission is expected to represent up to 6 per cent. of the total issuedshare capital of the Company; (ii) the SLPs (being certain Scottish limited partnerships set up to provide a funding mechanism pursuant to which GSK will provide additional funding forGSK's UK Pension Schemes) will transfer their respective holdings ofGSKCHH C Ordinary Shares, representing 11.03 per cent. (in aggregate) ofGSKCHH's ordinary share capital, to the Company in exchange for suchnumber of new Haleon Shares as is required so that, on Admission, the SLPswill together hold Haleon Shares representing 7.5 per cent. (in aggregate andto the nearest whole Haleon Share) of the total issued share capital of theCompany; and (iii) Pfizer will transfer its entire holding in PFCHH to the Company in exchange for: (a) 25 million Non-Voting Preference Shares; and (b) such number of HaleonShares as will result in Pfizer holding, on Admission, Haleon Sharesrepresenting 32 per cent. of the total issued share capital of the Company (tothe nearest whole Haleon Share). Pfizer will sell its entire holding in theNon-Voting Preference Shares to one or more third party investor(s)immediately following the share-for-share exchange with the Companydescribed in this paragraph 3.1(C)(iii).

The risks and uncertainties relating to the Haleon Shares, the Group's business and the industry in which it operates summarised in the part of this Prospectus headed \"Summary\" are the risks that theDirectors believe to be the most essential to an assessment of Haleon Shares. However, as the riskswhich the Group faces relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in thefuture, you should consider not only the information on the key risks summarised in the part of thisProspectus headed \"Summary\" but also, among other things, the risks and uncertainties describedbelow. The risks and uncertainties described below represent those the Directors consider to be material as at the date of this Prospectus. However, these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing theGroup. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Directors, or that the Directorscurrently consider to be immaterial, may individually or cumulatively also materially and adverselyaffect the business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects of the Group. If any or acombination of these risks actually occurs, the business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects of the Group could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the market price ofHaleon Shares could decline. You should carefully consider the information in this Prospectus in lightof your personal circumstances. 1. RISKS RELATING TO THE GROUP'S BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY1.1 The Group operates in a highly competitive market and failure to successfully compete with competitors could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business The Group faces substantial and increasing competition in all of its product categories and geographic markets. There are relatively low barriers to entry in certain product categories inmany of the markets in which the Group operates (particularly in the VMS category) andaccordingly the Group's businesses compete with companies of all sizes on many differentfronts, including cost-effectiveness, product effectiveness and quality, brand recognition andloyalty, technological innovations, consumer convenience, promotional activities, new productintroductions and expansion into new markets and channels. The Group expects to continue to see heightened activity from its competitors worldwide, including an increase in the introduction and aggressive marketing of new products in highdemand healthcare areas. In particular, the Group expects to experience: (i) increasing andaggressive competition from smaller, high growth companies which often operate on a regionalbasis, and may disrupt existing route-to-market models; (ii) increasing competition frommultinational corporations moving for the first time into, or expanding or focusing their presence(whether through acquisitions, disposals, demergers or other means) in the global consumerhealthcare market in order to benefit from the higher profit margins on offer and greaterconsumer interest in health products and services; and (iii) continuing competition from \"privatelabel\" products, which are brands sold exclusively by a particular retailer. Some of the Group's competitors may spend more aggressively on, or have more effective, advertising and promotion activities than the Group does, introduce competing products morequickly and/or respond more effectively to business and economic conditions and changingconsumer preferences, including by launching innovative new products. The Group's ability tocompete also depends on the strength of its brands and on its ability to enforce and defend itsintellectual property against infringement and legal challenges by competitors. The Group may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of the threats posed by the many competitors across its markets or to successfully respond to them, which could harm theGroup's business. In addition, the cost of responding to the increasingly significant and 17 widespread competition worldwide, including management time, out-of-pocket expenses and price reductions, may materially and adversely affect the Group's performance. Ultimately, aprolonged failure by the Group to compete effectively in its key markets could have a materialadverse effect on the Group's business, prospects, results of operations and financialcondition. 1.2 The Group's success depends on its ability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences and a failure to adapt its strategy appropriately may have amaterial adverse effect on the Group's business and/or financial condition As a consumer products business, the Group relies on its ability to leverage its existing brands and products to drive increased sales and profits. This in turn depends on the Group's ability toidentify and offer products at attractive prices that appeal to consumer tastes and preferences,which are difficult to predict and evolve over time. The Group's ability to implement thisstrategy depends on, among other things, its ability to: \u0081 continue to offer products that consumers want at competitive prices;\u0081 develop and maintain consumer interest in its brands and increase its brand recognition and loyalty; \u0081 innovate successfully on its existing products; and\u0081 effectively utilise a range of distribution channels in its key markets.The Group may not be able to execute this strategy successfully, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, prospects, results of operations and/or financialcondition. In addition, any reduction in consumer demand for the types of products which the Group offers as a result of changes in consumer lifestyle, environmental concerns, economicdownturns or other considerations could have a material adverse effect on the Group'sbusiness, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in recent years,there is increasing awareness of the environmental impact and sustainability of practices andproducts in the market (see paragraph 1.8 of Risk Factors below). 1.3 The Group's business results are impacted by the Group's ability to manage disruptions in the Group's global supply chain and a failure to manage disruptions appropriatelymay have a material adverse effect on the Group's business and/or financial condition The Group is engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale. The Group's operations and those of its suppliers, contract manufacturers and logisticsproviders have been and may continue to be disrupted by a number of factors, including, butnot limited to: \u0081 increased and/or changing regulation, as well as regulatory compliance issues;\u0081 environmental events, including natural disasters (such as fires, floods and earthquakes) and any potential effect of climate change; \u0081 widespread health emergencies, such as COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics, leading to delays in deliveries and constraints on shipping and logistics due to locallockdowns, such as the recent lockdowns in China that may impact the delivery to andfrom China of the Group's products, as well as resources required for its products; \u0081 strikes and other labour disputes;\u0081 disruptions in logistics; 18 \u0081 cybersecurity failures or incidents; \u0081 loss, impairment, closure or disruption of key manufacturing sites;\u0081 loss of key suppliers or contract manufacturers;\u0081 supplier capacity constraints;\u0081 raw material and product quality or safety issues (on which see further risk factor 1.10 below); \u0081 industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues;\u0081 the impact on the Group's suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets;\u0081 the lack of availability of qualified personnel;\u0081 global shipping, logistics, transport and warehousing constraints;\u0081 governmental incentives and controls (including import and export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers); \u0081 acts of war (on which see further risk factor 2.7 below) or terrorism, political unrest or uncertainty, fires or explosions, and other external factors over which the Group has nocontrol; and \u0081 increases in ingredient, commodity and oil prices.While the product ranges of the Group's leading brands are manufactured by multiple sources, some of the Group's products are currently primarily manufactured at a single location. Theloss of the use of all or a portion of any of the Group's manufacturing facilities or the loss of theuse of key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financialcondition and results of operations. In addition, the Group purchases certain raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified underindustry, governmental and its own standards, which can require additional investment andtake a significant period of time. Although the Group has contingency plans in place, such as dual sourcing programmes and alternative supply arrangements, those plans may not be sufficient to mitigate manufacturing orsupplier interruptions, and the Group may also be limited in its ability to pass on any priceincreases in the prices it charges for its products. For example, the Group has entered into,and may in the future enter into, fixed price contracts or hedging arrangements in order toaddress increases in commodity prices and their effect on the Group's ability to sourcematerials for its products. However, if prices decrease, the Group will be unable to realise thebenefit of the decrease due to fixed price contracts in place. A significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason, including those mentioned above, could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied,could lead to litigation or regulatory action, product delistings by retailers, financial penalties,and reputational damage that could materially and adversely affect the Group's business,results of operations and financial condition. 19 1.4 Increasing dependence on key retail customers, changes in the policies of the Group's retail customers, the emergence of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changingretail landscape may materially and adversely affect the Group's business The Group's products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-scale retailers,including pharmacies, as well as discounters and e-commerce retailers. With the growing trendtowards retail trade consolidation, increased cross-border trade, the rapid growth ofe-commerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers, the Groupis increasingly dependent on certain retailers, and some of these retailers have and maycontinue to have greater bargaining strength than the Group does. For example, similar to itscompetitors, while the Group maintains relationships with a variety of significant retailersacross its key markets, sales attributable to its top five largest retailers account for over half ofthe Group's revenue in the US market. The Group's large-scale retail customers, including pharmacies, may use their leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances, display fees or increased investment, includingthrough display media, paid search, preparation fees and other programmes, which could leadto reduced sales or profitability. The loss of a key retailer or a significant reduction in sales to akey retailer could materially and adversely affect the Group's business, prospects, results ofoperations and financial condition. The Group's business might also be negatively affected bythe growing presence and bargaining strength of customers who operate internationally andretail buying alliances (horizontal alliances of retailers, retail chains or entire retailer groups thatcooperate in pooling their resources) and the enhanced leverage that such alliances possess. The Group has also been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of the Group's retail trade and pharmacy customers, such as inventoryde-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of the Group's products, orenvironmental, sustainability, supply chain or packaging initiatives and other conditions. Forexample, a determination by a key retailer that any of the Group's ingredients should not beused in certain consumer products or that the Group's packaging does not comply with certainenvironmental, supply chain or packaging standards or initiatives could materially andadversely impact the Group's business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. \"Private label\" products sold by the Group's retail customers, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of the Group's products.In addition, the retail landscape in many of the Group's markets continues to evolve as a resultof the rapid growth of e-commerce retailers (who are able to generate \"private label\" productsand capitalise on access to data) and price comparison sites, changing consumer preferences(as consumers increasingly shop online), and, in certain categories (particularly VMS), theincreased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services, sales throughsocial media platforms and direct-to-consumer businesses (especially those which specialise inrapid distribution). The strong growth in e-commerce and the emergence of alternative retailchannels may create pricing and margin pressures and/or adversely affect the Group'srelationships with key retailers. If the Group is not able to successfully manage and adapt tothese changes in the retail landscape, the Group's business, prospects, results of operationsand financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 1.5 The Group may not be able to develop and commercialise new products effectively, which may materially and adversely affect the results of the Group's operations andfinancial condition The future growth of the Group is to a significant extent dependent on its ability to develop new products or new formulations of existing products. The Group's ability to launch new productsand to expand into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or markets is affected bywhether the Group can successfully: \u0081 identify, develop and fund technological innovations;\u0081 obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others; 20 \u0081 obtain and maintain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the FDA, the EMA, the NMPA and other regulatory bodies in the countries in which the Grouphas business operations, including in relation to Rx-to-OTC switches; \u0081 anticipate, quickly respond to, and benefit from the needs and preferences of consumers and customers by, among other things, effectively utilising digital technology and marketingand data analytics to gain new commercial insights and develop relevant marketing andadvertising to identify new products that will align with consumer preferences; and \u0081 successfully compete to in-license products.The identification, development and introduction of innovative new products that drive incremental sales involves considerable costs and effort, and any new product may notgenerate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable productor to cover the costs of its development and promotion. The Group's ability to achieve asuccessful launch of a new product could also be adversely affected by pre-emptive actionstaken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities andadvertising. In addition, new products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in themarketplace. The product development process is both time-consuming and costly and involves a high degree of business risk. In particular, the Group's OTC products, including those in respect ofwhich it is undertaking an Rx-to-OTC switch, are subject to lengthy development programmesand regulatory approval periods which can restrict the Group's ability to innovate in this productarea. The Group must develop, test and manufacture products to meet its own internalspecifications and standards as well as all applicable regulatory and safety requirements, and itis possible that a new product can fail to make it to market at any stage of this process. Whilstthe Group has a good track record of developing new products and executing Rx-to-OTCswitches, there can be no guarantee that the Group will continue to be able to develop andcommercialise new products at the rate required to retain or grow market share or that suitableopportunities for further Rx-to-OTC switches will become available to the Group. Any failure todevelop and commercialise new products in a timely fashion may decrease revenue and/orincrease R&D costs and, consequently, may materially and adversely affect the results of theGroup's operations and financial condition. 1.6 Failure to retain key personnel or attract new personnel may materially and adversely affect the Group's business The Group relies upon a number of key executives and employees who have an in-depth understanding of the consumer healthcare industry and the Group's technologies, products,programmes, collaborative relationships and strategic goals. While the Group follows adisciplined, ongoing succession planning process and has succession plans in place for SeniorManagement and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualifiedsenior executives will continue to be available to the Group at all times. Competition for suchpersonnel in the consumer healthcare industry is intense, and there can be no assurance thatthe Group will be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel, particularly ascompetitors may attempt to recruit them. Further, the Group's ability to implement its strategy depends on the ability and experience of its Senior Management and other key employees. If the Group is unable to recruit, attract andretain talented, highly qualified Senior Management and other key people, including throughcompetitive remuneration and benefits packages, appropriate career development, employeeresilience and engagement programmes, the Group's business, prospects, results ofoperations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. The Group isalso working to advance cultural change through the implementation of diversity, equality andinclusion initiatives and through the implementation of a new purpose, strategy and cultureprogramme throughout the organisation. If the Group does not (or is perceived not to)successfully implement these plans and initiatives, its ability to recruit, attract and retain talentmay be materially and adversely impacted, which may in turn materially and adversely affectthe Group's business, results of operations and financial condition. 21 1.7 Damage to the Group's reputation could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business Maintaining the Group's strong reputation and trust with consumers and the Group's customers globally is critical to selling the Group's branded products. Negative publicity about the Group,the Group's industry, the Group's brands and products, the Group's advertising and promotionpractices, the Group's use, storage and securing of technology and data, including personaldata, the Group's supply chain, the Group's ingredients, the Group's packaging, the Group'sresearch practices, threatened or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings, the Group'spublic policy engagement, the Group's environmental, social and governance practices,including as they relate to diversity, equality and inclusion, the health, safety and welfare ofemployees or other stakeholders, or relations with the Group's employees, or regulatoryinfractions, violations of sanctions or anti-bribery rules, whether or not deserved, couldjeopardise the Group's reputation and/or expose it to adverse press and social media attention. The Group's reputation may also be adversely affected if third parties with whom the Group contracts, including its suppliers, manufacturers and customers, fail to maintain high ethical,social and environmental standards, comply with local laws and regulations or become subjectto other negative events or adverse publicity. Such third parties may also enter intorelationships with or be acquired by other third parties whose values, business practices and/orreputation expose the Group to the risk of adverse publicity and damage to its existingrelationships by association. While the Group has policies and procedures for managing thirdparty relationships, it may not be possible to fully ensure that third parties adhere to the samestandards and values as the Group or to replace third party relationships in a timely and/orcost-effective manner. In addition, widespread use of digital and social media by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination. Negative publicity, posts orcomments on social media about the Group, the Group's brands, the Group's products,including any ingredients used in its products, the Group's packaging or the Group'semployees, whether true or untrue, could damage the Group's brands and its reputation and/orlead to boycotts of its products. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of Advil(an ibuprofen-based product) were adversely impacted by negative media coverage regardingthe use of ibuprofen products in treating the symptoms of COVID-19. Moreover, the Group'sreputation could be harmed as a result of inappropriate use of its branded products beingpromoted on social media and any associated negative publicity. The success of the Group'sbrands could also suffer if the Group's marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on abrand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Counterfeiting is a common issue for successful brands and has been amplified by e-commerce. Although the Group has an anti-counterfeiting programme in place, third partiescontinue to sell counterfeit versions of the Group's products, such as Sensodyne, Panadol andENO, including on online platforms and on social media. These counterfeits are inferior inquality to the genuine Group products and may pose safety risks to consumers. Consumers ofthe Group's brands could confuse the Group's products with these counterfeit products,purchasing the counterfeit products in error instead of the genuine Group products. Theconsumption of inferior quality products, which consumers believe to be genuine (and, in someinstances, may cause consumer safety issues) could also damage the reputation of the Groupand its brands and lead to a reduction in market share with affected consumers choosing in thefuture to buy competitors' brands instead. Damage to the Group's reputation or loss of consumer confidence in the Group's products for these or any other reasons could materially and adversely affect the Group's business, resultsof operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to rebuild theGroup's reputation. 22 1.8 Failure to respond effectively to the challenges raised by climate change and other sustainability matters may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business andresults of operations Concern over climate change and other sustainability matters has increased the focus on the sustainability of practices and products in the market and may result in new or additional legaland regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate environmental or social impacts. Areas offocus relevant to the Group's business include, among others, responsible sourcing anddeforestation, human and labour rights, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability orrecoverability of packaging, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and the use ofcertain materials, such as palm oil where the sourcing or environmental impact of the materialhas been linked to sustainability issues and therefore attracts scrutiny. If new or additional legaland regulatory requirements relating to sustainability matters are more stringent than theGroup's current legal and regulatory obligations and/or the Group's existing practices andprocedures are inadequate to meet these requirements, this may require the Group to reviseits operations and supply chain management, including, for example, by collecting usedproducts, packaging or other materials from consumers and reintroducing them to the Group'smanufacturing cycle. There may also be financial impacts as governments implement taxation,such as extended producer responsibility taxes or carbon taxes to help to recover the cost ofmanaging plastic waste and the impacts of climate change. These developments may result inincreased costs and disruption to the Group's operations, which could materially and adverselyaffect the Group's business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The Group's reputation is also affected by its perceived sustainability credentials and its ability to meet its sustainability goals. There is increased public attention, including bynon-governmental organisations, investors, customers, consumers, the Group's employeesand other stakeholders, on climate change and other sustainability matters. Despite theGroup's sustainability efforts, any failure or perceived failure to achieve its sustainability goals,including, among others, to reduce net scope 1 and 2 emissions by 100 per cent. by 2030(versus its 2020 baseline) and to make all product packaging recyclable or reusable by 2030(versus its 2020 baseline and quality, safety and regulations permitting), or the perception(whether or not valid) that the Group has failed to act responsibly with respect to such mattersor to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climatechange, could result in adverse publicity and/or litigation which could materially and adverselyaffect the Group's business and reputation. This could result in product delistings withcustomers or loss of preference with consumers, investors, employees or other stakeholders,which could materially and adversely affect the Group's business, results of operations, cashflows and financial condition. The Group is dependent on shifts in the wider industry to meet some of its sustainability goals and there is a risk that the Group will not meet its goals if those shifts do not take place. Inorder to reduce its scope 3 carbon footprint, the Group depends on shifts in the energy gridaway from fossil fuels and towards renewable sources in the areas the Group sources fromand sells its products. The Group's transition to more sustainable packaging formats andcircular business models is dependent on, among other things: the supply of recycled contentor alternative non-virgin petroleum-based plastic materials; regulatory approval for use ofalternative materials; the availability of new packaging technologies; and improvements inrecycling infrastructure. In order to meet its sustainable sourcing goals, the Group alsodepends on the availability of sustainably sourced commodities at a reasonable cost. Adversedevelopments in respect of such dependencies may result in the Group failing to meet itssustainability goals and could lead to a material adverse effect on the Group's reputationwhich, in turn, could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations, cashflows and financial condition. 1.9 The Group may not be successful in obtaining, maintaining and enforcing sufficient intellectual property rights to protect its business, or in avoiding claims that the Groupinfringes on the intellectual property rights of others The Group relies on various types of intellectual property rights such as trade marks, patents, copyrights and designs, whether registered or unregistered, as well as unpatented proprietary 23 knowledge and trade secrets, to protect its business. However, these rights do not afford complete protection against third parties' claims and infringements. For example, trade marks,patents, copyrights and designs are territorial; thus, the Group's business can only claimoptimal IP protection in jurisdictions where the Group has obtained trade mark, patent, designand copyright registrations, or has obtained licences to use third-party trade marks, patents,copyrights or registered designs. While IP laws are fairly harmonised around the world, certaincountries' laws may not protect the Group's intellectual property rights to the same extent asafforded in the UK and the USA. Additionally, there can be no assurance that third parties willnot independently develop knowledge and trade secrets that are similar to the Group's, ordevelop products or brands that compete effectively with the Group's products and brandswithout infringing, misusing or otherwise violating any of the Group's intellectual property rights. The Directors cannot be certain that any of the Group's registered (granted or pending) or unregistered trade marks, patents, copyrights, or designs will provide the Group with sufficientprotection from competitors, or that any intellectual property rights which the Group does holdwill not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. In the event of such achallenge, the Group could incur significant costs to defend its intellectual property rights, evenif it is ultimately successful. Additionally, there is a risk that the Group will not be able to obtainand perfect or, where appropriate, obtain licences for the intellectual property rights necessaryto support new product introductions and product innovations. Additionally, the Group haslicensed, and may license in the future, trade marks, patents, trade secrets and otherintellectual property rights to third parties. While the Group attempts to ensure that itsintellectual property rights are protected when entering into business relationships, third partiesmay take actions that could materially and adversely affect the Group's rights or the value of itsintellectual property rights. The Group also uses intellectual property rights in-licensed from licensors. The Group's licences to such intellectual property rights may not provide exclusive or unrestricted rights inall fields of use and in all territories in which the Group may wish to develop or commercialiseits products in the future and may restrict its rights to offer certain products in certain markets,including through non-compete provisions, or impose other obligations on the Group inexchange for its rights to the licensed intellectual property. In addition, the Group may not havefull control over the maintenance, protection, enforcement or use of the intellectual propertyrights in-licensed from licensors, and therefore the Group may be reliant on the licensors toconduct such activities. Disputes may arise between the Group and its licensors regarding the scope of rights or obligations under the relevant intellectual property licence agreements, including the scope ofthe Group's rights to use the licensed intellectual property, the Group's rights with respect tothird parties, the Group's and its licensors' obligations with respect to the maintenance andprotection of the licensed intellectual property, financial obligations of the Group to the licensor,and other interpretation-related issues. The agreements under which the Group licensesintellectual property rights from others are complex, and the provisions of such agreementsmay be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretationdisagreement that may arise could narrow what the Directors believe to be the scope of theGroup's rights to the intellectual property being licensed, or increase what the Directors believeto be its financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement. Termination of or disputesover such licences could result in the loss of significant rights. Third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and misuse the Group's proprietary knowledge, trade secrets, trade marks, patents, designs or copyrights, or infringe or otherwise violate theGroup's intellectual property rights. For example, the Group's brands are well-established inthe market and have attracted trade mark and patent infringers in the past. Additionally, theGroup may not be able to prevent current and former employees, contractors and other partiesfrom misappropriating the Group's confidential and proprietary knowledge. Infringement,misuse or other violation of any of the Group's intellectual property rights may dilute or diminishthe value and goodwill of its brands and products in the marketplace, which could materiallyand adversely affect the Group's results of operations and make it more difficult for the Groupto maintain a strong market position. While the Group protects its intellectual property rights, 24 including through litigation, where necessary, it cannot economically prevent all infringements, misuses or other violations, and any litigation could be protracted and costly and could have amaterial adverse effect on the Group's business and results of operations regardless of itsoutcome. 1.10 The Group may incur liabilities or be forced to recall products as a result of real or perceived product quality or other product-related issues Failure to comply with good manufacturing or good distribution practices and regulations, as well as other regulations in relation to product quality, throughout the Group's in-house andcontract manufacturing supply and distribution chains could lead to product supplyinterruptions, product recalls or withdrawals, litigation and/or regulatory enforcement action andfines from regulators, such as the FDA, EMA and NMPA, despite employee training, promotionof a health and safety culture, and control measures and systems being in place that aredesigned to ensure that the safety and quality of the Group's products is maintained. By way ofexample, raw materials which the Group sources for production may become contaminatedthrough the supply chain and other product defects may occur due to human error orequipment failure, among other things. Additionally, products may be contaminated ortampered with during distribution or at stores. The Group is increasingly using new technologyto enhance the manufacture and testing of its products, such as the deployment of newelectronic documentation systems and advanced laboratory information management tools.Such technology is inherently susceptible to the threat of cyberattacks which pose an ongoingrisk to the integrity of product quality data and its audit trail. The Group also continues to bereliant on third parties and is continuing to undertake a global network rationalisationprogramme to reduce the number of manufacturing sites it uses, both of which are factors thatmay increase the risks to safe and timely supply of products. Product recalls or withdrawals arising as a result of real or perceived product quality or other product related issues, whether initiated on a voluntary basis or otherwise, can result in arange of adverse consequences to the Group, including lost sales, the requirement to holdincreased inventories of substitute products, damaged relationships with regulators, loss ofmarket share to competitors, adverse publicity and reputational harm, in addition to the directcosts of implementing any recall. Furthermore, such product quality or other product relatedissues also expose the Group to a significant risk of litigation, particularly product liabilityclaims, and regulatory action (on which see further risk factor 2.4 below). Failure by the Group to manufacture its products in accordance with good manufacturing practices could have the potential to do significant damage to the Group's reputation andmaterially and adversely affect the results of its operations and financial condition. In addition,if any of the Group's competitors or customers supply faulty or contaminated products to themarket, the Group's industry could be negatively impacted, which in turn could have materialadverse effects on the Group's business. 1.11 A cyber-security incident, data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could materially and adversely impact the Group's business The Group relies extensively on information technology systems (\" IT Systems \"), including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties, including cloud-basedservice providers, and their vendors, in order to conduct its business. Although the Group has a broad array of information security measures in place, the Group's IT Systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom it has contracted, havebeen, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes,unauthorised access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups, individuals andnation states with a wide range of expertise and motives. Such cyber-attacks and cyberincidents can take many forms, including cyber extortion, social engineering, password theft orintroduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails. For example, 25 the Group experienced an increase in cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents in the months before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and there is a heightened risk of further cyber-attacks,including from state actors (see also paragraph 2.7 of Risk Factors below ). While the Group has implemented systems, monitoring and training to prevent cyber-attacks and other cyberincidents from being successful, the Group cannot guarantee that its security efforts willprevent breaches or breakdowns of its, or its third-party service providers', IT Systems sincethe techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect forperiods of time, and so such cyber-attacks may from time to time succeed. In addition, theGroup cannot guarantee that it or its third-party service providers' response to any suchincidents will fully remedy the extent of the damage caused by these incidents. Although theGroup has policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected byit or its third-party service providers is securely maintained, data breaches due to human erroror intentional or unintentional conduct may still occur in future. Furthermore, the Group periodically upgrades its IT Systems or adopts new technologies. If such an upgrade or new technology does not function as designed, does not go as planned orincreases the Group's exposure to a cyber-attack or cyber incident, it may adversely impact theGroup's business, including its ability to ship products to customers, issue invoices andprocess payments or order raw and packaging materials. If the Group were to suffer asignificant loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of abreach of its IT Systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom it hascontracted, or otherwise, the Group may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm,incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, litigation, fines and/ordamages, which may materially and adversely impact the Group's business, prospects, resultsof operations and financial condition. While the Group has disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if its IT Systems were damaged, breached or were to cease to function properly for any reason, including thepoor performance of, failure of or cyber-attack on, third-party service providers, catastrophicevents, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or othersimilar events and if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectivelyresolve such issues on a timely basis, the Group may suffer interruptions in its ability tomanage or conduct business as well as reputational harm, and may be subject togovernmental investigations and litigation, any of which may materially and adversely impactthe Group's business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 1.12 The Group relies on third parties in many aspects of its business and ineffective management of these relationships could increase the Group's financial, legal,reputational and operational risk Due to the scale and scope of the Group's business, the Group relies on relationships with third parties, including its suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors,commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for route-to-marketand for certain functions (including the outsourcing of certain back office and consumerrelations services). If the Group is unable to effectively manage and maintain its third-partyrelationships and the agreements under which the Group's third-party partners operate, itsresults of operations could be adversely impacted. For example, in China, part of the Group's business is conducted through Sino-American Tianjin Smith Kline & French Laboratories Ltd., which is a joint venture betweenGlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (Overseas) Limited, the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Groupand the Tianjin Zhongxin Pharmaceutical Group (the \" TSK&F Joint Venture \"), pursuant to a joint venture agreement which is due to expire in September 2024. If the Group does not renewthese arrangements or implement alternative measures, in either case on acceptable terms,then the continuity and development of part of its operations and route-to-market in China, aswell as its business, results of operations and cash flows in that market, may be adverselyaffected. Failure of third parties to meet their obligations to the Group or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the Group and third parties could adversely impact the Group's 26 operations and financial results. Additionally, while the Group has policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over businessoperations, and compliance with laws, regulations and Group policies and practices than isavailable for the Group's own operations and compliance, thereby potentially increasing theGroup's financial, reputational, operational and legal risk, including in respect of health andsafety, environmental, social and governance issues, modern slavery, anti-bribery andcorruption. 1.13 The Group faces various risks related to pandemics, epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns, the ultimate impact of which is outside the Group's control andwhich may materially and adversely affect the Group's operations, cash flows andfinancial condition The Group faces various risks related to pandemics, epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic. A pandemic, epidemic or similarwidespread health concern could have, and COVID-19 has had and will continue to have, avariety of impacts on the Group's business, results of operations, cash flows and financialcondition, including: \u0081 the Group's ability to continue to maintain and support the health, safety and well-being of the Group's employees, including key employees; \u0081 volatility in the demand for and availability of the Group's products, which may be caused by the temporary inability of the Group's consumers to purchase the Group's products dueto illness, financial hardship, quarantine, government actions mandating the closure of theGroup's distributors or retailers or imposing travel or movement restrictions, shifts indemand and consumption away from more discretionary or higher priced products tolower-priced products, or pantry-loading activity; \u0081 increases in demand for certain of the Group's products requiring the Group to increase its production capacity or acquire additional capacity at an additional cost and expense; \u0081 decreases in demand and sales for certain of the Group's key products such as Theraflu and Robitussin due to a particularly weaker cold and flu season; \u0081 changes in regulatory policy, including restrictions on sales of certain products. For example, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, in certain countries specific restrictions wereintroduced on the sale of cough and cold medicines in an attempt to prevent patients fromself-medicating against COVID-19 at home. In China, in early 2020, certain localauthorities introduced temporary restrictions on the sale of such medicines, which limitedsales of Contac (nasal decongestant tablets that also relieve pain and reduce fever) andFenbid (ibuprofen-based relief medicine) by the Group in 2020, adversely affecting theGroup's revenue in APAC in FY 2020; \u0081 changes in purchasing patterns of the Group's consumers, including the frequency of in-store visits by consumers to retailers and dental and skin health professionals and a shiftto purchasing the Group's products online from e-commerce retailers; \u0081 disruptions to the Group's global supply chain (including the closure of manufacturing and distribution facilities) due to, among other things, the availability of raw and packagingmaterials or manufacturing components; a decrease in the Group's workforce or in theefficiency of such workforce, including as a result of illness, travel restrictions, absenteeismor governmental regulations; and transportation and logistics challenges, including as aresult of port and border closures and other governmental restrictions or reduced shippingcapacity; \u0081 failure of third parties on which the Group relies, including the Group's retailers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, customers, commercial banks, joint venture 27 partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the Group, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financialor operational difficulties; \u0081 significant changes in the economic and political conditions of the markets in which the Group operates, which could restrict and have restricted the Group's employees' ability towork and travel, could mandate and have mandated or caused the closure of certaindistributors or retailers, the Group's offices, shared business service centres and/oroperating and manufacturing facilities, or otherwise could prevent and have prevented theGroup as well as the Group's third-party partners, suppliers or customers from sufficientlystaffing operations, including operations necessary for the manufacture, distribution, saleand support of the Group's products; \u0081 disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets, which may increase the cost of capital and/or adversely impact the Group's access to capital; and/or \u0081 volatility in foreign exchange rates and in raw and packaging materials and logistics costs.Despite the Group's efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond the Group's knowledge or control, including the duration, severity andgeographic scope of an outbreak, such as COVID-19, the availability, widespread distributionand use of safe and effective vaccines and the actions taken to contain its spread and mitigateits public health and economic effects. 1.14 The implementation of complex strategic, operational and/or change initiatives gives rise to significant execution risks, which may affect the operational capacity of theGroup and may materially and adversely impact the Group if these initiatives fail to meettheir objectives The Group has undertaken a number of, and may from time to time commence, strategic, operational and/or change initiatives. For example, the Group has previously implementedstrategic initiatives to effectively integrate the Novartis and Pfizer consumer healthcarebusinesses and execute a targeted programme of non-core asset divestments. There may befinancial, operational, regulatory, customer and reputational implications if such initiatives fail(either wholly or in part) to meet their objectives, which could place strain on the operationalcapacity of the Group. The scale and nature of the programmes and management challengesmay cause disruption to resourcing through heightened uncertainty, increased workloads andshort-term resource stretch, which, in turn, could result in the disruption of business as usualactivities. Implementing further strategic, operational and/or change initiatives may amplifythese risks. Any disruption caused by, or failure to successfully implement any such initiativescould have a material adverse effect on the Group's ordinary course business and,consequently, its financial condition, results of operations and prospects, or otherwise harm theGroup's reputation. 1.15 The Group's business is affected by seasonality, which could have a negative impact on the Group's financial condition Portions of the Group's business are seasonal. This is driven by seasonal demand for certain products, including its cough, cold and flu, allergy and decongestant products, such as Therafluand Robitussin. In respect of such products, if the seasonal effects which help to deliverperformance are negatively impacted, including due to unfavourable economic conditions, thiscould have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial condition and results ofoperations for the entire year. Government measures imposed in response to COVID-19, suchas lockdowns and social distancing restrictions, have tempered the usual seasonal spikes inthe incidence of flu and cold, thus reducing demand for the Group's cold and flu product linesduring FY 2021. Because of quarterly fluctuations caused by these and other factors,comparisons of the Group's operating results across different fiscal quarters may not beaccurate indicators of the Group's future performance. 28 1.16 The Group may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, licence rights to technologies or products, form and manage alliances, or divest businesses The Group may decide in the future to pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, strategic alliances or divestitures as part of its business strategy. The Group may not completethese transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all. In addition, the Groupmay be subject to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that preventit from realising the expected benefits of such transactions. Even if the Group is successful incompleting an acquisition, the products, intellectual property and technologies that areacquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investmentsthan originally anticipated. The Group may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully intoits existing business, and the Group may be unable to achieve expected operating marginimprovements, synergies or efficiencies. The Group could also incur or assume significant debtand unknown or contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions. The Group's reportedoperating results could be negatively affected by acquisition or disposition-related charges,amortisation of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-termassets. The Group may be subject to litigation in connection with, or as a result of, acquisitions,dispositions, licences or other alliances, including claims from terminated employees,customers or third parties, and the Group may be liable for future or existing litigation andclaims related to the acquired business, disposition, licence or other alliance because eitherthe Group is not indemnified for such claims or the scope or availability of indemnification islimited. These effects could cause the Group to incur significant expenses and could materiallyand adversely affect the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition. 1.17 The Group's leverage and debt service obligations could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations Prior to the date of this Prospectus, the Group has incurred financial indebtedness in order to fund the Pre-Demerger Dividend. As a result, the Group has higher leverage levels than arereflected in the Group's longer-term strategy and has significant debt service obligations. TheGroup's longer-term strategy to improve its financial risk profile, including by reducing levels ofindebtedness, may not be successful. As at the Latest Practicable Date, the Group has the following financial indebtedness outstanding: \u0081 \u00a3300,000,000 2.875 per cent. notes due 29 October 2028 and \u00a3400,000,000 3.375 per cent. notes due 29 March 2038, each issued by GSK Consumer Healthcare Capital UK plcpursuant to the Programme; \u0081\u20ac850,000,000 1.250 per cent. notes due 29 March 2026, \u20ac750,000,000 1.750 per cent. notes due 29 March 2030 and \u20ac750,000,000 2.125 per cent. notes due 29 March 2034, each issued by GSK Consumer Healthcare Capital NL B.V. pursuant to the Programme; \u0081 $700,000,000 3.024 per cent. callable fixed rate senior notes due 2024, $300,000,000 callable floating rate senior notes due 2024, $2,000,000,000 3.375 per cent. fixed ratesenior notes due 2027, $1,000,000,000 3.375 per cent. fixed rate senior notes due 2029,$2,000,000,000 3.625 per cent. fixed rate senior notes due 2032 and $1,000,000,0004.000 per cent. fixed rate senior notes due 2052, each issued by the US Issuer pursuant toa private placement to institutional investors in the USA and outside the USA; \u0081 $1,750,000,000 3.125 per cent. fixed rate senior notes due 2025 issued by GSK Consumer Healthcare Capital UK plc pursuant to a private placement to institutional investors in theUSA and outside the USA; \u0081 \u00a3nil under the Term Loan Facility (noting the Term Loan Facility is expected to be drawn on or prior to the date of the Pre-Demerger Dividend); and \u0081 \u00a3nil and $nil of RCF Loans. 29 Following payment of the Pre-Demerger Dividend, an amount equal to the Pre-Separation Debt Proceeds less \u00a3300 million will have been distributed out of the Group, with no recourse, toGSK and Pfizer and none of the Group's debt will continue to benefit from guarantees providedby GSK. The degree to which the Group is leveraged could have important consequences to the Group's business, including, but not limited to: \u0081 increasing the Group's vulnerability to, and reducing its flexibility to respond to, a downturn in the Group's business or general adverse economic and industry conditions; \u0081 limiting the Group's ability to obtain additional financing in the longer term;\u0081 requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of the Group's cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on the Group's indebtedness and the repayment of principal,thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund capital expenditures, dividends,joint ventures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; \u0081 increasing the cost of future borrowings for the Group;\u0081 a downgrade in the Group's credit rating, which may, in turn, increase the cost of the Group's financing arrangements and make it difficult for the Group to access financing oncommercially acceptable terms or at all; \u0081 limiting the Group's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the Group's business and the competitive environment and the industry in which it operates; and \u0081 placing the Group at a competitive disadvantage as compared to some of its competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Group may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Programme, the EMTN Issuers have capacityto issue up to \u00a310,000,000,000 in principal amount of notes (inclusive of the Pre-SeparationProgramme Notes that have already been issued) which could further increase the Group'sleverage and financial indebtedness. In addition, the Group's Revolving Credit Facilities makeavailable \u00a31,000,000,000 and $1,400,000,000 of commitments to provide RCF Loans whichremain undrawn as at the Latest Practicable Date. The covenants in existing financinginstruments do not fully prohibit the Company or its subsidiaries from incurring moreindebtedness. If new debt is added to the Group's current debt levels, the risks that it nowfaces could intensify. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the leverage-related risks described herein and would increase the risk of a downgrade in the Group's creditrating. 1.18 The Group's business and results of operations are affected by fluctuations in interest rates The Group is subject to risk from financial instruments that bear interest at floating rates, including one series of the Pre-Separation USD Notes and borrowings under the Group's bankfinancing facilities. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasingthe Group's interest expenses associated with these obligations and reducing cash flowavailable for other purposes. The Group currently hedges a portion of the interest rates on its financial instruments with the aim of achieving an appropriate balance of fixed-rate and floating-rate exposures. However, itmay not be able to replace or extend such hedges on terms that are acceptable to the Group,or at all, and either the Group's overall strategy or any individual hedge may not be fullyeffective, which would expose the Group to interest rate risk. 30 1.19 Goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets are a material component of the Group's balance sheet and impairments of these assets could have a significant impact on itsresults The Group has recorded a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, representing \u00a326.45 billion as of 31 December 2021, on its balance sheet. The Group tests thecarrying values of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment at least annuallyand whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made inconnection with impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations andcash flows. While the Directors have concluded that the Group's goodwill and indefinite-lifeintangible assets are not impaired, future events could cause the Directors to conclude that thegoodwill associated with a given segment, or one of the Group's indefinite-life intangibleassets, may have become impaired. Any resulting impairment charge, although non-cash,could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financialcondition. 2. RISKS RELATING TO CHANGES IN LAW AND THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, REGULATION AND LEGISLATION 2.1 The Group's business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in all the markets in which it operates, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group's businessoperations and financial condition The Group's business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in all the markets in which it operates. Such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects ofthe Group's products, including their development, ingredients, formulation, manufacture,packaging content, labelling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising,promotion beyond therapeutic indications, sale and environmental impact. Many differentgovernmental and regulatory authorities in the Group's markets regulate and have jurisdictionover different aspects of the Group's business activities. In addition, the Group's sellingpractices are regulated by competition law authorities in the UK, as well as in the EU, the USAand other markets. For example, in China, where the Group has significant sales and operations, governmental authorities introduced changes in regulations relating to registrations of all generic medicines(including OTC products) and recently introduced changes for oral health products. Theseaffect both new and existing products and impose increased data submission requirements forproducts the Group markets in China. There is a risk that commercialisation of certain productsof the Group may be restricted in China if the Group is unable to comply with these regulatorychanges on the required timetable. New or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements, could materially and adversely impact the Group's business, results ofoperations and financial condition. For example, regulators have decided, and might decide inthe future, that certain products of the Group should be prescription only or otherwisereclassified, resulting in new regulations and laws, including in respect of claims, becomingapplicable to such products. Because of the Group's extensive international operations, the Group could be materially and adversely affected by violations of worldwide anti-bribery laws, including those that prohibitcompanies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials orother third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the US ForeignCorrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010, and other laws that prohibit commercialbribery. Additionally, in certain jurisdictions, the Group's engagement with healthcareprofessionals and other external leaders is subject to applicable restrictions. While the Group'spolicies mandate compliance with such laws, the Group cannot provide assurance that theGroup's internal control policies and procedures will always protect the Group from reckless orcriminal acts committed by its employees, joint venture partners or agents. Similarly, due to theGroup's international operations, the Group could also be materially and adversely affected by 31 any violations of international sanctions laws, which continue to evolve in response to geopolitical events (see also paragraph 2.7 of Risk Factors below). Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt the Group's business and materially and adverselyaffect its reputation and the Group's business, prospects, results of operations and financialcondition. While it is the Group's policy to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the Group's business, there can be no guarantee that the Group will always achieve fullcompliance and a finding that the Group is in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicablelaws or regulations could subject the Group to civil remedies, including fines, damages,injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could materially andadversely affect the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if aclaim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the cost of responding to such aclaim, including management time and out-of-pocket expenses, and the negative publicitysurrounding such assertions regarding the Group's products, processes or business practicescould materially and adversely affect the Group's reputation, brand image and the Group'sbusiness, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 2.2 The Group faces risks relating to the regulation and perception of the ingredients it uses in its products, which could materially and adversely impact the Group's business,prospects, financial condition and results of operations Regulatory bodies and consumer groups may, from time to time, request or conduct reviews of the use of certain ingredients that are used in manufacturing the Group's products, the resultsof which may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business as the Group may needto reformulate its products. For example, certain materials in consumer products are underscrutiny in the EU, such as Titanium Dioxide, Synthetic Amorphous Silica and the potential, inmedicines, for Nitrosamine formation. If the result of such reviews is an inability to use orrestrictions on the use of certain ingredients and/or any requirement for remedial action, theGroup may incur significant additional costs and/or need to invest substantial resources tomake formulation adjustments to its products. Additionally, the Group may be adverselyaffected by the findings and any remedial actions resulting from the EU's ongoinginvestigations into the impact of pharmaceuticals in the environment, such as the levels ofdiclofenac measured in water in the EU. While the Group monitors and seeks to respond to and address the impact of any emerging regulatory and legislative developments, new or more stringent ingredient legislation couldhave a negative impact on the Group's business, undermine the Group's reputation andgoodwill and affect consumer demand or trade customer demand for products containing suchingredients. If the Group voluntarily removes, or is required to remove, certain ingredients fromits products, it may not be able to develop an alternative formulation, successfully modify itsexisting products or obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, or at all, whichcould materially and adversely impact the Group's business, prospects, financial condition andresults of operations. 2.3 The Group's business is subject to market fluctuations and general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, each of which may materially andadversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations andprospects Uncertainty, fluctuations or negative trends in the international economic climate have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the Group's business and profitability.There will be market fluctuations and economic factors that will be beyond the Group's control,but that will have the potential to materially and adversely affect its business, revenue, financialcondition and operating results. Such factors include: (i) inflation or deflation; (ii) changes in government, fiscal and monetary policies; (iii) changes in the financial standing of the Group's customers, suppliers andconsumers, including levels of employment, real disposable income, salaries and wage rates;(iv) consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions; (v) retailers'perception of consumer spending habits; (vi) technological change; (vii) exposure to possiblyadverse governmental or regulatory actions in countries where the Group operates or conducts 32 business; (viii) levels of volatility in global markets; (ix) exposure to the effects of economic sanctions or other restrictive economic measures as a result of the Group's global presence;and (x) any change or development in global, national or regional economic and politicalconditions. For example, the Group is exposed to inflationary pressures and commodity prices, which generally affect the Group through their impact on payroll and supply costs (including freight).Inflationary pressures in FY 2021 increased the Group's commodity, freight and payroll costs,which had an adverse impact on the Group's operating profit and operating profit margin.Whilst the Group may increase product prices in order to mitigate the impact of inflation,competitive pressures may constrain the Group's ability to fully recover any increased costs inthis way, and so the Group may remain subject to market risk with respect to inflationarypressures and increases in commodity prices. In addition, the Group's initiatives to offsetheadwinds from inflation in input prices and commodities, including forward buying, valueengineering and alternative supply arrangements, may not be sufficient to mitigate these risks. Whilst the Group's diversified geographic presence, product offering and consumer profile may help to mitigate its exposure to risks that are localised or product- or consumer group-specific,there can be no assurance that these risks would arise in such a way. The occurrence of anyof these risks could materially and adversely affect the business, revenue, financial conditionand operating results of the Group. 2.4 Litigation, disputes and regulatory investigations may materially and adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects The Group is, and may in the future be, subject to legal proceedings, disputes and regulatory and governmental investigations in various contexts, including consumer fraud actions,competitor and regulatory challenges to product and marketing claims, competition lawinvestigations, product liability and quality claims, human resources claims, contractualdisputes and other disputes or claims arising in the ordinary course of its business operations.These legal actions, disputes and investigations may relate to aspects of the Group'sbusinesses and operations that are specific to the Group, or that are common to companiesthat operate in the Group's markets, and this risk may be enhanced in circumstances wherethe Group is operating in new markets. Legal actions and disputes may arise under contracts,regulations or from a course of conduct taken by the Group, and may be class actions. For example, in the USA, the Group is a defendant in ongoing proton pump inhibitor (\" PPI\") litigation, in which plaintiffs have alleged that their use of PPIs caused serious bodily injuries.The Group has filed motions to dismiss several hundred cases, but the court has not yet ruledon those motions. In addition, certain members of the GSK Group and the Pfizer Group areparty to proceedings relating to the detection of N-Nitroso-dimethylamine in Zantac (ranitidine)products. Pursuant to the Pfizer SAPA, the Group has certain indemnification obligations to theGSK Group and the Pfizer Group in respect of \"Purchaser Liabilities\" and \"Assumed Liabilities\"(each as defined in the Pfizer SAPA), which may include liabilities related to OTC Zantac (seeparagraph 3.5 of Risk Factors below). Further, in 2013, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare GmbH & Co. KG and other members of a German trade mark association were fined by theFederal Cartel Office of Germany, as a result of the exchange of certain information duringmeetings from 2004 to 2006. Following the fine, the Group has become party to several civilproceedings in Germany for follow-on damages. An adverse outcome in such proceedings (orany other related proceedings) may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business,reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Although the Group has developed and implemented a set of standards, controls, and policies and procedures that are highly tailored to the specific requirements of the Group and theregulatory regimes of the jurisdictions in which it operates, there is no guarantee that thosestandards, controls, and policies and procedures will totally shield the Group from liability, andthe Group remains exposed to the risk of potential civil and/or criminal actions leading todamages, fines and sanctions. For example, the risk of consumer fraud class actions,competitor, regulatory and governmental challenges to product and marketing claims, andproduct liability lawsuits remains significant. Governmental agencies such as the FTC are very 33 active in oversight of consumer products as they seek to prevent consumer fraud. The FTC may have changing enforcement priorities in this area, for example, the use of expertendorsements/testimonials, COVID-19-related marketing claims, all-natural marketing claimsand environmental marketing claims. Consumer fraud actions, and competitor, regulatory andgovernmental challenges to product and marketing claims, and class-action lawsuits affectingthe Group have the potential to do significant damage to the Group's reputation and materiallyand adversely affect the results of its operations and financial condition. Given the large or indeterminate amounts of damages sometimes sought by claimants, other sanctions that might be imposed (including the Group no longer being able to use key claims)and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and disputes, it is possible that an adverseoutcome to any litigation, dispute, government or regulatory investigation could have a materialadverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations andprospects. At 31 December 2021, the Group had \u00a314 million of provisions for legal disputesand other matters, including amounts relating to legal and administrative proceedings. 2.5 The Group faces risks associated with significant international operations, which could negatively impact the Group's business The Group operates on a global basis with 96.6 per cent. of the Group's revenue in FY 2021 originating in markets outside the UK. While geographic diversity helps to reduce the Group'sexposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that the Group facesrisks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to: \u0081 changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies (as set out in more detail in paragraph 2.10 of Risk Factors below); \u0081 exchange controls, export controls, economic sanctions and other limits on the Group's ability to import or export raw materials or finished products, including as a result of theCOVID-19 pandemic, or to repatriate earnings from overseas; \u0081 political or economic instability (on which see also paragraph 2.7 of Risk Factors below), geopolitical events (such as environmental events), widespread health emergencies (suchas the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics or epidemics), natural disasters or socialor labour unrest; \u0081 rising geopolitical trade tensions in the Group's key markets, such as between the USA, Western Europe and China; \u0081 changing macroeconomic conditions in the Group's markets;\u0081 lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where the Group operates and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or otherlegal rights; \u0081 foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalisation or expropriation of property or other resources; \u0081 changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequencesor the imposition of and/or the increase in onerous trade restrictions, tariffs and/or pricecontrols (including requirements to exclusively utilise local manufacturing); and \u0081 changes to labour laws, travel or immigration restrictions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics or epidemics. Any or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on the Group's ability to sell its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may materially and adversely 34 affect its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, whichcould reduce sales volumes of the Group's products or result in a shift in its product mix fromhigher margin to lower margin product offerings. 2.6 Volatility in material and other costs could materially and adversely impact the Group's profitability Increases in the costs of and/or a reduction in the availability of materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients and raw and packaging material commodities, aswell as labour, energy, logistics and other necessary services, such as those seen during theCOVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the Group's profit margins. If material and othercost increases continue in the future and the Group is unable to pass along such higher costsin the form of price increases, achieve cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing anddistribution, or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies, ongoingproductivity initiatives and the potential use of commodity hedging contracts, the Group'sbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adverselyimpacted. In addition, even if the Group were able to increase the prices of its products inresponse to material and other cost increases, the Group may not be able to sustain the priceincreases. Also, sustained price increases may lead to declines in sales volumes ascompetitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay higher prices,which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share and could materially and adverselyaffect the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition. 2.7 The Group's business may be impacted by the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine The Group is monitoring the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the GSK Board overseeing and monitoring key risks. The Board will assume oversight and management ofthese risks after Separation. The Group's operations and presence in Russia and Ukraine islimited and these markets accounted for less than 3 per cent. of each of the Group's revenueand Adjusted operating profit in FY 2021. However, the broader economic consequences ofthe invasion are currently difficult to predict, and geopolitical instability, the imposition ofsanctions and other restrictive measures against Russia and any retaliatory actions taken byRussia in response to such measures could adversely affect the global markets and the globalgeopolitical and economic environment, which could in turn adversely impact the Group'sbusiness and/or the trading prices of its securities. Specifically, the Group faces the followingrisks: \u0081 The Group's business includes employees based in Russia and Ukraine and revenue deriving from sales in Russia and Ukraine. Although the Group does not consider that itsbusiness in Russia and Ukraine constitutes a material part of the Group's business, thesituation remains highly uncertain and the Group is actively monitoring the situation, therisks to its employees and the significant risk of disruption to its operations, including inrelation to the importation and distribution of its products, in Russia and Ukraine and othercountries in the region. \u0081 The Group generates revenue from sales of its products in Russia in the Russian Ruble, while significant costs (notably, manufacturing and supply chain costs) associated withthose products are denominated in other currencies, such as Euro and US Dollar. Theinternational response to the invasion, including the imposition of international sanctionsagainst Russia, has had a significant adverse effect on the value of the Russian Ruble,which has reduced the Group's revenue from its operations in Russia without acorresponding reduction in costs, and the Group may not be able to offset the devaluationof the Russian Ruble through increased prices of its products. In addition, the imposition ofexchange controls may limit the Group's ability to repatriate profits from its operations inRussia. \u0081 The Group's customers in Russia and Ukraine have been significantly negatively affected by the factors described above, which exposes the Group to increased counterparty risk inrelation to these customers and receivables from these customers. 35 \u0081 Given the Group's international presence, it is subject to various global sanctions regimes, and similar laws, regulations or orders imposed in response to the invasion, many of whichare evolving rapidly. The Group is monitoring changes to applicable global sanctionsregimes to ensure it remains in compliance with its obligations, as any failure to complywith the evolving sanctions could present legal and reputational risks, which could, in turn,have a material and adverse effect on the Group's business. In addition, there is a risk thatRussia's response to the global sanctions regime, as well as additional internationalsanctions against Russia, creates regulatory uncertainty and presents further compliancechallenges for the Group's operations, which will increase compliance costs and make itdifficult to continue operations in Russia. \u0081 There may be certain reputational risks associated with the Group's continued presence in the Russian market. Negative publicity surrounding the Group's continued presence and/orsupply of products to the general public in Russia could damage the Group's brands andits reputation, lead to boycotts of its products (outside of Russia) and/or haveconsequences on the continuation of operations and/or sales in Russia, including adetermination by the Group to discontinue all sales in Russia. For further details on similarrisks facing the Group, please also see paragraph 1.7 of Risk Factors . \u0081 As of the date of this Prospectus, the Russian government has indicated it has drawn up plans to seize the assets of western companies leaving Russia. While the scope of suchmeasures is not presently clear, if the Group ceased its activities and/or suspended itsoperations in Russia and did not resume its presence in Russia within a certain period oftime, there is a risk the Russian government could: (i) nationalise the Group's assetslocated in Russia; (ii) allow the Group's patents and trade marks to be used within Russiawithout the Group's consent; and/or (iii) introduce restrictions on, or impose unfavourableterms in respect of, payments made from Russia or relating to assets in Russia. In addition to the specific implications for the Group's operations in Russia and Ukraine, the Group may be affected by broader impacts on the global geopolitical and economicenvironment, including (but not limited to) changes in commodity, freight, logistics and inputcosts. The situation remains highly uncertain and there may be additional risks to the Group arising out of or relating to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the escalating military conflict in theregion, which could also have a material and adverse impact on the Group's business. 2.8 Failure to comply with regulation regarding the use of personal data could lead to significant fines and regulatory action against the Group The Group is subject to regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates regarding the use of personal data. The Group collects and processes personal data from its consumers,customers, business contacts and employees as part of the operation of its business, andtherefore it must comply with data protection and privacy laws. Those laws generally imposecertain requirements on the Group in respect of the collection, retention, use and processing ofsuch personal information. Notwithstanding its efforts, the Group is exposed to the risk that thisdata could be wrongfully appropriated, lost, disclosed, retained, stolen or processed in breachof data protection laws. In addition, increased regulatory restrictions on the use of cookies maymaterially and adversely affect the Group's marketing practices as well as the cost efficiency ofsuch strategies. Failure to operate effective data collection controls could potentially lead toregulatory censure, fines, reputational and financial costs. The EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, as well as the increased data protection regulation in other jurisdictions, such as the Personal Information Protection Law 2021, Cybersecurity Law 2016and Data Security Law 2021 in China (each of which has a significant impact on the processingof data in China), the Federal Law No. 152-FZ on Personal Data in Russia, and the CaliforniaConsumer Privacy Act of 2018 in California, USA, introduced the potential for significant newlevels of fines for non-compliance based on turnover. The Group will continue to review anddevelop existing processes to ensure that customer personal data is processed in compliance 36 with applicable requirements, to the extent that they are applicable, and it may be required to expend significant capital or other resources and/or modify its operations to meet suchrequirements, any or a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on theGroup's business, financial condition and financial results, or otherwise harm its reputation. 2.9 Failure to comply, or the costs of complying, with environmental and health and safety regulations could materially and adversely affect the Group's operations The Group is subject to regulation relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety, including regulations governing air emission, effluent discharge, and the use,generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of certain materials. The Directorsbelieve that it is in compliance in all material respects with all such laws, rules, regulations andpolicies applicable to the Group. However, there can be no assurance that the Group will notbe required to incur significant costs to comply with such environmental and health and safetylaws and regulations in the future. Additionally, failure to manage environmental, health andsafety and sustainability risks could lead to significant harm to people, the environment andcommunities in which the Group operates, fines, failure to meet stakeholder expectations andregulatory requirements, litigation or regulatory action and damage to the Group's reputationand could materially and adversely affect the Group's financial results. Additionally, workingconditions in global supply chains are subject to increased scrutiny and growing regulatory andlegislative requirements, including for companies to evidence their human rights due diligenceassessments. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in sanctions, includinginjunctions, fines, civil liability and exclusion from public procurement being imposed on theGroup. In addition, most product, component and raw material supply chains present a number of potential reputational risks relating to: labour standards; health, safety and environmentalstandards; raw material sourcing; and the social, ethical and environmental performance ofthird party manufacturers and other suppliers. The Group mandates minimum requirementsregarding these issues, in line with international guidelines, for the Group's own manufacturingsites, third party manufacturers and suppliers. If it is perceived that the Group is not respectingor advancing the economic and social progress and safety of the local communities it works in,the Group's reputation could be damaged, which could have a negative impact on the Group's'social licence to operate', the Group's ability to secure new resources and labour and theGroup's financial performance. 2.10 The Group is exposed to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related hedging activities, which could negatively impact the Group's financial conditionand prospects As further described in paragraph 2.5 of Risk Factors above, the Group operates internationally and holds assets, incurs liabilities, generates sales and pays expenses in a variety ofcurrencies other than Pounds Sterling (the currency in which it reports its financial results). TheGroup's operations outside the UK generated 96.6 per cent. of revenue in FY 2021. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have reduced and could continue to reduce the Pounds Sterling value of sales, earnings and cash flows the Group receives frommarkets outside the UK, increase its supply costs (as measured in Pounds Sterling) in thosemarkets, negatively impact its competitiveness in those markets or otherwise materially andadversely impact its business or financial condition. The Group's foreign currency exposure willbe greater for so long as the leverage levels of the Group are higher than are reflected in theGroup's longer-term strategy, the success of which cannot be guaranteed. The Group aims tomanage this risk through hedging where possible and practical; however, there are risksassociated with the use of hedging instruments (including derivative financial instruments).While limiting to some degree the Group's risk from fluctuations in currency exchange, suchhedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adversefinancial effect resulting from variations to such rates. The Group is also exposed tocounterparty credit (or repayment) risk in respect of counterparties to hedging contracts. 37 To the extent any hedging activities of the Group are wholly or partially ineffective, or to the extent a hedging counterparty fails to meet its obligations under any hedging agreement, thiscould result in losses which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business,results of operations and financial condition. 2.11 Determinations made by the Group with respect to the application of tax law may result in challenges from or disputes with tax authorities which result in the payment ofadditional amounts for tax The Group has a significant exposure to business operations which are subject to taxation across multiple jurisdictions. The worldwide nature of the Group's operations means thatintellectual property, R&D and manufacturing operations are centred in a number of locations.A consequence of this is that the Group's cross-border supply routes, which are necessary toensure supplies of healthcare products into numerous end markets, can be subject to complextax laws and can result in conflicting claims from tax authorities as to the profits to be taxed inindividual countries. Additionally, the Group is subject to many different forms of taxation withinany given jurisdiction in which it operates (including, but not limited to, corporate income taxes,capital gains taxes on direct or indirect transfers of ownership, stamp duty and similar transfertaxes, value added taxes, property taxes and social security and other payroll taxes) and manytax regimes - domestically as well as cross-border - are increasingly complex (such that theproper interpretation and application of tax laws is not always clear). This means that theGroup may be subject to domestic and cross-border tax authority disputes (potentially includingdisputes between tax authorities), including with respect to the actions taken, or to be taken, inconnection with Separation, which could result in the payment of additional amounts of tax.Such potential disputes and the resulting payment obligations could have a material andadverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition. At31 December 2021, the Group had recognised provisions of \u00a3150 million in respect ofuncertain tax positions. 2.12 The Company's status as a non-US corporation for US federal income tax purposes could be affected by a potential change in law Corporations such as the Company that are organised outside the USA are generally treated as non-US corporations for US federal income tax purposes. However, section 7874 of theCode and the Treasury regulations thereunder can cause a corporation organised outside theUnited States to be treated as a US corporation for US federal income tax purposes if: (i) thecorporation (the \"Acquiring Non-US Corporation\") directly or indirectly acquires substantially allof the properties of a US corporation (the \"Acquired US Corporation\"); (ii) the shareholders ofthe Acquired US Corporation are treated as holding at least 80 per cent. of the shares of theAcquiring Non-US Corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding shares in the AcquiredUS Corporation (adjusting, for this purpose, for certain transactions such as certaincontributions and distributions and for certain fact patterns); and (iii) certain other requirementsare met. A corporation that is treated as a US corporation as a result of the application of these rules generally is subject to US federal income tax on its worldwide income, and dividends it pays toshareholders that are not US Holders are subject to US withholding taxes, among otheradverse consequences. Because such a corporation would be a dual resident for tax purposes,these taxes may apply in addition to (and not instead of) the taxes imposed by the jurisdictionin which such corporation is otherwise resident, and there may be other adverse taxconsequences of being dual resident for tax purposes (such as restrictions on use of certainreliefs). In addition, even if the Acquiring Non-US Corporation is not treated as a UScorporation under the test described above, in certain circumstances section 7874 can insteadcause the Acquiring Non-US Corporation to be subject to different adverse US federal incometax consequences (including the unavailability of the preferential rate applicable to \"qualifieddividends\"). The rules for determining whether a transaction is subject to section 7874 are complex and subject to varying interpretations and potential legislative and regulatory changes. The 38 Company believes that under current law the Company should be treated as a non-US corporation (and should not be subject to the other adverse consequences of section 7874 asdescribed above). However, several proposals to significantly expand the scope of section7874 have been advanced over the years, including by the Biden administration and mostrecently in December 2021 as part of the US Senate's consideration of the Build Back BetterAct, which was not enacted into law. Accordingly, it is possible that such a proposal will beenacted (possibly with retroactive effect), and there can be no assurance that section 7874 andthe Treasury regulations thereunder will not be amended in a way that could cause theCompany, as a result of Separation, either to be treated as a US corporation or to be subject tothe other adverse consequences of section 7874 as described above. 2.13 If the Company loses its foreign private issuer status in the USA in the future, it may incur significant additional expenses which could have a material adverse effect on theGroup's business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition The Company is a \"foreign private issuer\" in the USA, as such term is defined under the US Exchange Act, and, therefore, the Company is not required to comply with all the periodicdisclosure and current reporting requirements of the US Exchange Act and related rules andregulations. Under the US Exchange Act, the determination of foreign private issuer status ismade annually on the last business day of an issuer's most recently completed second fiscalquarter and, accordingly, the next determination will be made with respect to the Company on30 June 2022. In the future, the Company would lose its foreign private issuer status if a majority of its shares are owned by US residents and: (i) a majority of its directors or executive officers are UScitizens or residents; (ii) more than 50 per cent. of its assets are located in the USA; or (iii) itsbusiness is administered principally in the USA. As of 31 December 2021, 37 per cent. of theGroup's assets were located in the USA. The regulatory and compliance costs to the Companyunder US securities laws as a US domestic issuer may be significantly more than costs theCompany incurs as a foreign private issuer. If the Company is not a foreign private issuer, itwould be required to file periodic reports and registration statements on US domestic issuerforms with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \" SEC \"), which are more detailed and extensive in certain respects than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. The Companywould also have to mandatorily comply with US federal proxy requirements, and its executiveofficers, directors and principal shareholders would become subject to the short-swing profitdisclosure and recovery provisions of Section 16 of the US Exchange Act. Further, theCompany would be required under current SEC rules to prepare its financial statements inaccordance with US generally accepted accounting principles and modify certain of its policiesto comply with corporate governance practices associated with US domestic issuers. Inaddition, the Company may lose its ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporategovernance requirements on US stock exchanges that are available to foreign private issuers.Such transition and modifications would involve additional costs and may divert management'sattention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on theCompany's business, financial condition and results of operations. 3. RISKS RELATING TO THE DEMERGER AND SEPARATION3.1 The Group may fail to realise any or all of the anticipated benefits of the Demerger and Separation The extent to which the anticipated benefits of the Demerger and Separation, including, among others, the creation of a standalone public company with a leadership team with independentcontrol of its strategy and capital allocation decisions and the maximisation of shareholdervalue, may be realised, is subject to a number of factors, including many which are outside ofthe Group's control. There can be no guarantee that the anticipated benefits of the Demergerand Separation will be realised in full or in part, or as to the timing when any such benefits maybe realised. Failure to realise the anticipated benefits of the Demerger and Separation, in full orin part, or in a timely manner, could result in a delay in the execution of the strategic objectivesof the Group and/or have a disruptive effect on the Group's management and employees. This 39 could in turn have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 3.2 The Company will incur new costs in its transition to a standalone public company and its management team will be required to devote substantial time to new compliancematters As a standalone public company, the Company will incur additional legal, accounting, financing and other expenses, including the costs of recruiting and retaining non-executive directors,costs resulting from public company reporting obligations and the rules and regulationsregarding corporate governance practices, including the listing requirements of the LSE andthe NYSE. There can be no assurance that, under a changed Board structure and ownership,and in an environment where it is subject to greater scrutiny and disclosure requirements, theGroup will be able to manage its operations in the same manner as it has done as part of theGSK Group (see also paragraph 3.3 of Risk Factors below). In particular, the Group will be subject to increased regulatory obligations as a result of being listed, and its management team will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensurethat the Group complies with all of these requirements. The implementation of new policies andprocedures across the Group could require significant time and energy that would otherwise bedevoted to the business' operating activities and strategy. In addition, the reportingrequirements, rules and regulations will increase the Group's legal and financial compliancecosts and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\" Sarbanes-Oxley \"), as well as regulations subsequently adopted by the SEC and the NYSE, have imposed various requirements on public companies,including rules regarding corporate governance practices. Sarbanes-Oxley requires, amongother things, that the Group maintain and periodically evaluate its internal controls overfinancial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. The Group and its managementteam will have to perform system and process evaluation and testing of the Group's internalcontrols over financial reporting to allow management and the Group's reporting accountants toreport on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls over financial reporting, as requiredby section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. The Group currently tests its internal controls over financial reporting on a regular basis, in accordance with the financial reporting practices and policies of the GSK Group. However,doing so as a standalone entity may require the Group's management team and otheremployees to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these requirements and alsoincrease the Group's legal and financial compliance costs. In particular, compliance withsection 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley after Separation will require additional expenses andmanagement efforts. 3.3 Following the Demerger and Separation, the Company will need to operate as an independent publicly listed company and the Group could fail to meet the challengesinvolved in operating successfully as a standalone business Following the Demerger and Separation, the Company will need to operate as an independent publicly listed company. The Group's operations have historically benefited from certain GSK central office resources, including, among other things, access to its larger finance and treasury, corporate secretariat,legal, procurement, information technology, investor relations and human resources teams.The Group has also benefited from negotiated arrangements with third-party suppliers,distributors, licensors, lessors, other business partners and/or counterparties as part of thelarger GSK Group. It cannot be assured that the Group will be able to maintain sucharrangements or replace them on similar terms. Following the Demerger and Separation, the Group will take on additional responsibility for these activities and, in preparation, it has enhanced its standalone arrangements in a wide 40 range of areas, including finance and treasury, corporate secretariat and investor relations. Further, the Group will continue to have access to certain resources of the GSK Group underthe terms of the Transition Services Agreement (see paragraph 3.4 of Risk Factors below). However, there remains a risk that the Group could suffer operational difficulties without access to the support and services from GSK following the Demerger and Separation, whichcould have a material adverse effect on the Group's business. These challenges include:(i) demonstrating to interested parties that the Demerger and Separation will not result inadverse changes in standards of business and impairment of relationships with consumers,customers, regulators or employees; (ii) retaining key personnel; (iii) distraction ofmanagement; (iv) difficulty in marketing and communicating effectively the capabilities of theGroup as a standalone business; and (v) successfully negotiating the rebranding exercise suchthat consumers accept the new branding under the Company name. Furthermore, thereremains a risk that operating as an independent group may reduce the Group's flexibility todeal with unexpected events and require additional resources. In addition, there is a risk that the actual costs of the standalone arrangements could be higher than expected, that there could be unanticipated dis-synergies and/or that the Group will needto further invest in new services and functions. These risks, individually or together, could havea material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations andprospects. 3.4 For a period following the Demerger and Separation, the Company will be reliant on the GSK Group for the provision of certain services and any disruption to such servicescould be costly and materially and adversely affect the Group's business, results ofoperations, financial conditions and prospects In connection with the Demerger and Separation, GSK and the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement. Services to be procured by the Group under the TransitionServices Agreement include certain information services, back office services and distributionservices for a transitional period as required by the Group. The majority of services will beprovided for a fixed period of not more than 12 months, and certain services may be extendedsubject to certain conditions. As the Group does not currently have the capabilities to providethese services internally, on a standalone basis, without third-party support, the TransitionServices Agreement provides contractual protections for the continued provision of theseservices during the relevant transitional period, absent which the Group would need to procurethese services from other third-party providers. As a result, any significant disruption or otherissues in the services provided by the GSK Group under the Transition Services Agreement,even if they give rise to a contractual claim, may cause operational difficulties that couldnegatively impact the Group's performance and results of operations. Following the transitional periods set out in the Transition Services Agreement, the Group will be required to provide these services internally or obtain these services from a third-partyprovider. If the Group does not effectively develop and implement these capabilities, or it isunable to source further arrangements from third-party providers, its business, results ofoperations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 3.5 The Group has indemnification obligations in favour of the GSK Group and the Pfizer Group, which could be significant and have a material adverse effect on the financialcondition, results of operations and/or prospects of the Group GSK, Pfizer and CH JVCo, entered into the Pfizer SAPA on 19 December 2018 pursuant to which GSK, Pfizer and CH JVCo agreed to form a new global consumer healthcare jointventure. The Pfizer SAPA, as amended from time to time, including by the Pfizer SAPAAmendment Agreement, contains certain cross indemnities among the GSK Group, the PfizerGroup and the Group. Among other provisions, CH JVCo is required to indemnify the GSKGroup and the Pfizer Group in respect of \"Purchaser Liabilities\" and \"Assumed Liabilities\". TheCompany is also required such indemnity obligations of CH JVCo which mayinclude liabilities related to OTC Zantac. Certain members of the GSK Group and the Pfizer 41 Group are party to certain proceedings relating to the detection of N-Nitroso-dimethylamine in Zantac (ranitidine) products. While Pfizer and GSK have each served the Group with notice ofpotential claims under the relevant indemnification provisions in the Pfizer SAPA in relation topossible liabilities connected with OTC Zantac, it is not possible, at this stage, to meaningfullyassess or to quantify or reliably estimate what liability (if any) that the Group may have to theGSK Group and/or the Pfizer Group under the relevant indemnities. Pursuant to certain other agreements entered into between the GSK Group and the Group in connection with Separation, including the Asset Transfer Framework Agreement, the GSKGroup and the Group have provided certain cross indemnities in relation to certain businesses,assets, liabilities and employees transferring from the GSK Group to the Group, as well as fromthe Group to the GSK Group. For example, these include certain manufacturing sites inArgentina and Brazil to be transferred from the GSK Group to the Group following Separation.Among other requirements, CH JVCo is required to indemnify GSK in respect of lossesresulting from or arising out of past, present or future ownership, operation, use or conduct ofcertain aspects of such assets and/or businesses transferring from the GSK Group to theGroup. In addition, on or around the date of this Prospectus, GSK, Pfizer, the Company, CH JVCo and GSKCHH entered into the Tax Covenant, which is to be effective from the time of theDemerger. The Tax Covenant contains certain indemnities (subject to certain financial andother limitations) in respect of taxation given from GSK and Pfizer to the Company (and viceversa). Such indemnities will survive completion of the Demerger and Separation. If any amounts payable by the Group under the indemnities (or additional taxes imposed on the Group that arenot indemnified by GSK and/or Pfizer under the Tax Covenant) are substantial, this could havea material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects ofthe Group. 3.6 The Tax Covenant will restrict the Company's ability to engage in certain transactions As discussed above, the Company entered into the Tax Covenant on or around the date of this Prospectus, which is to be effective from the time of the Demerger. The Tax Covenant imposescertain restrictions on the Company, including certain restrictions with respect to actionsfollowing completion of the Demerger that could cause Separation to fail to qualify for itsintended US federal income tax treatment. The restrictions primarily require the Company tomaintain the corporate structure of certain parts of the Group as it was immediately prior to theDemerger. For example, there are restrictions on liquidating certain subsidiaries of theCompany, or issuing or redeeming shares in those subsidiaries. In addition, there arerestrictions on some intra-group disposals as well as certain non-ordinary course of businesstransactions. As a result of these restrictions (some of which could be in place for at least twoyears), the Company's ability to engage in certain transactions, such as the disposition ofcertain assets and certain repurchases of its stock, may be limited (although the Group willnonetheless be entitled to take actions which would otherwise be restricted if the Company first(i) obtains the consent of (or, in certain instances, if it consults with) GSK or Pfizer (asapplicable) or, in some cases, (ii) obtains an opinion from an appropriately qualified adviser ora ruling from the IRS regarding the tax consequences of the proposed actions which, in eithercase, is reasonably satisfactory to GSK or Pfizer (as applicable)). Although the Company doesnot currently anticipate that these restrictions would have a material adverse impact on theCompany, these restrictions may reduce the Company's ability to engage in certain businesstransactions that otherwise might be advantageous. 3.7 GSK and Pfizer may compete with the Group GSK and Pfizer will not be restricted from competing with the Group in the consumer healthcare business, including as a result of acquiring a company that operates a consumerhealthcare business. Due to the significant resources of GSK and Pfizer, including brandrecognition, financial resources and know-how resulting from the previous management of the 42 Group's business, GSK and Pfizer could have a significant competitive advantage over the Group should they decide to engage in the type of business the Group conducts, which maymaterially and adversely affect the Group's business, results of operations and financialcondition. 4. RISKS RELATING TO THE HALEON SHARES4.1 There is no existing market for the Haleon Shares and an active trading market for the Haleon Shares may not develop or be sustained Prior to Admission, there has been no public trading market for the Haleon Shares. Although the Company intends to apply to the FCA for admission to the premium listingsegment of the Official List and intends to apply to the LSE for admission to trading on itsmain market for listed securities, the Company can give no assurance that an activetrading market for the Haleon Shares will develop or, if developed, could be sustainedfollowing the closing of the Demerger and Separation. If an active trading market is notdeveloped or maintained, the liquidity and trading price of the Haleon Shares could bematerially and adversely affected. 4.2 The Pfizer Group will retain a significant interest in the Company following Admission and its interests may differ from those of the other Haleon Shareholders The Pfizer Group will retain a significant interest in the Company following Admission, including 32 per cent. of the Haleon Shares and thus of the voting rights of the Company. As a result, thePfizer Group will possess sufficient voting power to exercise significant influence over allmatters requiring shareholder approval, including the election or removal of directors andadvisers, the declaration of dividends, whether to accept the terms of a takeover offer andother matters to be determined by the Haleon Shareholders. In addition, the Pfizer Group has the right to nominate two persons to be appointed to the Board as representative directors for so long as it continues to hold 20 per cent. or more of theHaleon Shares in issue and a right to nominate one person to be appointed to the Board as arepresentative director for so long as it continues to hold less than 20 per cent. but at least10 per cent. of the Haleon Shares in issue. As at the date of this Prospectus, the Pfizer Grouphas nominated Bryan Supran and John Young, who will become directors on Admission. Inexercising its voting rights, the Pfizer Group may be motivated by interests that differ fromthose of the other Haleon Shareholders and the interests of the Pfizer Group could conflict withor differ from the Company's interests. The Company has entered into the Pfizer RelationshipAgreement to regulate its relationship with the Pfizer Group following Admission and, inparticular, to help ensure that the Company will be capable of operating and making decisionsfor the benefit of Haleon Shareholders as a whole and independently of the Pfizer Groupfollowing Admission. Notwithstanding the Pfizer Relationship Agreement, the concentration ofownership in the Pfizer Group may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing achange of control of the Company or impeding a merger, takeover or other businesscombination which may otherwise be favourable for the Company or the Group. This in turncould have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the Haleon Shares. So long as the Pfizer Group continues to own, whether directly or indirectly, a significant amount of the equity of the Company, the Pfizer Group will continue to be able to substantiallyinfluence the Group's ability to enter into any corporate transactions. 4.3 There can be no assurance that dividends will be paid on Haleon Shares The Company may determine not to pay dividends. If it determines that it will pay dividends, there can be no assurance that it will be able to pay dividends in the future. Under UKcompany law, a company can only pay cash dividends to the extent that it has distributablereserves and cash available for this purpose. As a holding company, the Company's ability topay dividends in the future will be affected by a number of factors, including having sufficient 43 distributable reserves and its ability to receive sufficient dividends from subsidiaries. The ability of companies within the Group to pay dividends and the Company's ability to receivedistributions from its investments in other entities are subject to restrictions, including, but notlimited to, the existence of sufficient distributable reserves and cash. Any of the foregoing couldhave a material adverse impact on the market price of the Haleon Shares. 4.4 The market price of the Haleon Shares may fluctuate Haleon Shareholders should be aware that the value of an investment in the Group may fluctuate and could be highly volatile. The price at which Haleon Shares may be quoted andthe price which investors may realise for their Haleon Shares will be influenced by a largenumber of factors, some specific to the Group and its operations, and some which may affectthe Group's industry as a whole, other comparable companies or publicly traded companies asa whole. The sentiments of the public market regarding the Demerger and Separation will be one such factor. Following Admission of the Haleon Shares, there may be a period of relatively high-volume trading in the Haleon Shares as the Company's shareholder register finds its naturalcomposition. For example, the Haleon Shares may become less attractive to certain classes ofexisting investors. The Company is unable to predict whether substantial amounts of theHaleon Shares will be sold in the open market following Admission. Sales of a substantialnumber of the Haleon Shares in the public market after Admission, or the perception that thesesales might occur, could depress the market price of the Haleon Shares. See also paragraph4.5 of Risk Factors below. This potential factor, together with other factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in the financial performance of the Group and its competitors, market fluctuations and/or factorsgenerally affecting consumers could lead to the market price of the Haleon Shares fluctuating. 4.5 Future sales of Haleon Shares, or the perception such sales might occur, could depress the market price of the Haleon Shares Following Admission, GSK will hold up to 6 per cent. of the Company's issued share capital and Pfizer will hold 32 per cent. of the Company's share capital. Furthermore, as part of certainarrangements pursuant to which GSK will provide additional support to GSK's UK PensionSchemes, the SLPs (being Scottish limited partnerships controlled by GSK and set up toprovide a funding mechanism pursuant to which GSK will provide additional funding for GSK'sUK Pension Schemes) will in aggregate hold 7.5 per cent. of the total issued share capital ofthe Company. The Haleon Shares owned by GSK, Pfizer and the SLPs are subject to certain lock-up restrictions. Following the expiration of the applicable lock-up period, or the waiver of suchlock-up restrictions, GSK, Pfizer and the SLPs will be able to sell their respective HaleonShares. During the period immediately prior to expiration of, and following the periods of salesrestrictions provided for by these lock-up arrangements, the market price for the HaleonShares may fall in anticipation of a sale of Haleon Shares. The perception that such salescould occur may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the Haleon Shares.This may make it more difficult for Haleon Shareholders to sell the Haleon Shares at a timeand price that they deem appropriate, and could also impede the Company's ability to issueequity securities in the future. 4.6 The Company may decide to offer additional Haleon Shares in the future, diluting the interests of existing Haleon Shareholders and potentially materially and adverselyaffecting the market price of Haleon Shares Other than in connection with Admission or pursuant to employee share plans, the Company has no current plans for an offer of shares. However, if the Company decides to offer additionalHaleon Shares or other securities convertible into Haleon Shares in the future, including as 44 consideration for any acquisitions, this could dilute the interests of existing Haleon Shareholders and/or have an adverse impact on the market price of Haleon Shares as couldthe public perception that an offering may occur. 4.7 Haleon Shareholders may not be able to exercise pre-emption rights or participate in certain future issues of Haleon Shares and Overseas Shareholders may not be able toparticipate in future issues of Haleon Shares In the case of a future allotment of new Haleon Shares for cash, existing Haleon Shareholders have certain statutory pre-emption rights, unless those rights are disapplied by a specialresolution of the Haleon Shareholders at a general meeting. An issue of new Haleon Sharesnot for cash or when pre-emption rights have been disapplied could dilute the interests of thethen-existing Haleon Shareholders. Securities laws of certain jurisdictions may restrict the Company's ability to allow participation by Haleon Shareholders in future offerings. In particular, shareholders in the USA may not beentitled to exercise these rights, unless either the Haleon Shares and any other securities thatare offered and sold are registered under the US Securities Act, or the Haleon Shares andsuch other securities are offered pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subjectto, the registration requirements of the US Securities Act. The Company cannot assureprospective investors it will register any such offers or sales under the US Securities Act, thatany exemption from such overseas securities law requirements would be available to enableUS or other Haleon Shareholders to exercise their pre-emption rights or, if available, that theCompany will utilise any such exemption. 4.8 The ability of Overseas Shareholders to bring actions or enforce judgments against the Company or the Directors may be limited The ability of an Overseas Shareholder to bring an action against the Company may be limited under law. The Company is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales. Therights of holders of the Haleon Shares are governed by English law and by the Articles ofAssociation. These rights differ from the rights of shareholders in typical US corporations andsome other non-UK companies. In particular, English law currently limits significantly thecircumstances under which the shareholders of English companies may bring derivativeactions. Under English law, in most cases, only the Company may be the proper plaintiff for thepurposes of maintaining proceedings in respect of wrongful acts committed against it and,generally, neither an individual shareholder, nor any group of shareholders, has any right ofaction in such circumstances. English law does not afford appraisal rights to dissentingshareholders in the form typically available to shareholders in a US company. In addition, itmay not be possible for an Overseas Shareholder to enforce any judgments in civil orcommercial matters or any judgments in securities laws of countries other than the UK againstsome or all of the Directors or executive officers of the Company who are resident in the UK orcountries other than those in which judgment is made. 4.9 Overseas Shareholders may be subject to exchange rate risk The Haleon Shares are, and any dividends to be paid in respect of them will be, denominated in Pounds Sterling. An investment in Haleon Shares by an investor whose principal currency isnot Pounds Sterling exposes the investor to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Anydepreciation of Pounds Sterling in relation to such foreign currency will reduce the value of theinvestment in the Haleon Shares or any dividends in foreign currency terms. 45 PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION 1.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION6.1 Overview The Company has a complex financial history for the purposes of Article 18(3) of the Prospectus Regulation. To comply with the requirements of the Prospectus Regulation, thefollowing historical financial information is presented in this Prospectus: \u0081 consolidated financial information of the Group for the financial years ended 31 December 2021, 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019; and \u0081 combined historical financial information of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business for the seven months ended 31 July 2019. 48 6.2 Historical Financial Information The Group's Historical Financial Information included in Schedule II ( Historical Financial Information of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings (No.2) Limited ) has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Prospectus Regulation (including therequirements regarding issuers with complex financial histories), the Listing Rules and thebasis of preparation included in Note 1 of Schedule II ( Historical Financial Information of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings (No.2) Limited ). The basis of preparation describes the extent to which the Historical Financial Information has been prepared inaccordance with IFRS. The accounting policies applied and stated in the Historical FinancialInformation are set out in Note 2 of Schedule II ( Historical Financial Information of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings (No.2) Limited ). On 31 July 2019, the Group completed a transaction with Pfizer to combine substantially all of GSK and Pfizer's respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new world-leadingconsumer healthcare joint venture (the \" Pfizer Transaction \", as further described in paragraph 2.3 of Part I ( Key Highlights and Development of the Group )). Since the completion of the Pfizer Transaction, GSK has owned 68 per cent. of the ordinary shares in CH JVCo, being theentity through which both GSK and Pfizer hold their equity interests in the joint venture and thecurrent holding company of the Group's business, with Pfizer holding the remaining 32 percent. of the equity interest. The Pfizer Contributed CH Business was consolidated within theGroup's financial statements from 1 August 2019. Unless otherwise stated in this Prospectus, financial information relating to the Group has been extracted without material adjustment from Schedule II ( Historical Financial Information of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings (No.2) Limited ). 6.3 Comparison of Historical Financial Information and Interim Financial Information to GSK Segment Financials Whilst a part of the GSK Group, a significant majority of the Group has historically been reported as an operating segment under IFRS 8 in GSK's annual report and interim financialreporting (the \" Consumer Healthcare Segment \"). The Historical Financial Information and the Interim Financial Information have been prepared to reflect the legal perimeter of the Group inconnection with the anticipated Demerger and Separation of the Company from the GSKGroup and therefore differ both in purpose and basis of preparation to the ConsumerHealthcare Segment as presented historically in GSK's financial reporting. As a result, whilstthe two sets of financial information are similar, they are not the same because of certaindifferences in accounting and disclosure under IFRS. These differences primarily include: (A) the inclusion in the Consumer Healthcare Segment of certain distribution and local commercial activities performed by a limited number of other GSK Group entities inrelation to consumer healthcare products; (B) the basis of allocation of certain cost-sharing and royalty agreements as attributed by a limited number of other GSK Group entities for the purposes of the ConsumerHealthcare Segment; (C) the inclusion of Horlicks and other consumer healthcare nutrition products in India and certain other markets in the Consumer Healthcare Segment; and (D) the sale of ThermaCare products until their disposal in 2020 which have been excluded from the Consumer Healthcare Segment (but included in the Historical FinancialInformation). 49 6.4 Reporting Framework The financial information presented in this Prospectus reflects the operating and financial performance of the Group, its cash flows and financial position and resources. The Group'sresults as reported in accordance with IFRS represent the Group's overall performance. TheGroup also uses a number of adjusted, non-IFRS, measures to report the performance of itsbusiness, as described below. Description of Key Line Items in the Group's Financial StatementsThe following descriptions of key line items in the financial statements are relevant to the discussion of the Group's results of operations in Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ). Item Represents Revenue Revenue from sales of goods to external customers against received orders. Revenue represents netinvoice value including fixed and variable consideration.Variable consideration arises on the sale of goods as aresult of discounts and allowances given and accrualsfor estimated future returns and rebates. Revenue is notrecognised in full until it is highly probable that asignificant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenuerecognised will not occur. The methodology andassumptions used to estimate rebates and returns aremonitored and adjusted regularly in light of contractualand legal obligations, historical trends, past experienceand projected market conditions. Once the uncertaintyassociated with the returns and rebates is resolved,revenue is adjusted accordingly. Value added tax andother sales taxes are excluded from revenue. Cost of sales Cost of sales includes all costs directly related to bringing products to their final selling destination.

Adjusted Results and other non-IFRS financial measuresThis Prospectus contains a number of non-IFRS measures to report the performance of the Group's business. Non-IFRS measures exclude amounts that are included in, or includeamounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated andpresented in accordance with IFRS, or are calculated using financial measures that are notcalculated in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted Results and other non-IFRS measures may beconsidered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information presented inaccordance with IFRS. The Directors consider these metrics to be the non-IFRS financial measures used by the Group to help evaluate growth trends, establish budgets and assess operational performanceand efficiencies. The Directors believe that these non-IFRS financial measures, in addition toIFRS measures, provide an enhanced understanding of the Group's results and related trends,therefore increasing transparency and clarity of the Group's results and business. There are no generally accepted accounting principles governing the calculation of these measures and the criteria upon which these measures are based can vary from company tocompany. The non-IFRS financial measures presented in this Prospectus may not becomparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies, have limitations asanalytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of theGroup's operating results as reported under IFRS. The Directors encourage investors andanalysts not to rely on any single financial measure but to review the Group's financial andnon-financial information in its entirety. The following non-IFRS measures are presented in this Prospectus: Measure Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is one of the measures used by management to assess the financial performance of theGroup's business. It is defined as profit after taxexcluding income tax, finance income, finance expense,Adjusting Items (as defined in paragraph 5.2 of Part VI(Selected Financial Information )), depreciation of property plant and equipment, impairment of propertyplant and equipment, right-of-use assets and computersoftware net of reversals, depreciation of right-of-useassets, and amortisation of software intangibles. 51 Adjusted EBITDA eliminates differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting netfinance costs), tax positions (such as the availability ofnet operating losses against which to relieve taxableprofits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affectingrelative depreciation expense) and the extent to whichintangible assets are identifiable (affecting relativeamortisation expense). Accordingly, the Directorsbelieve that Adjusted EBITDA provides usefulinformation to investors and others in understandingand evaluating the Group's operating results in thesame manner as the Group's management. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure and investors should not consider it in isolation or as asubstitute for analysis of the Group's results ofoperations as reported under IFRS. In addition to thelimitations inherent to all Adjusted Results (as definedbelow), some other limitations are: \u0081 Although depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciatedand amortised may have to be replaced in the futureand Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capitalexpenditure requirements for such replacements orfor new capital expenditure or lease extensions; and \u0081 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect net finance expense/income, cash requirements for the Group'sworking capital, transaction related costs,separation and admission costs and disposal costs. Adjusted Results Adjusted Results comprise Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted gross profit margin, Adjusted operating profit,Adjusted operating profit margin, Adjusted profit beforetaxation, Adjusted profit after taxation, Adjusted profitattributable to shareholders, Adjusted basic earningsper share, Adjusted diluted earnings per share,Adjusted cost of sales, Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted R&D,Adjusted other operating income, Adjusted net financecosts, Adjusted taxation charge, and Adjusted profitattributable to non-controlling interests. AdjustedResults exclude Net amortisation and impairment ofintangible assets, Restructuring costs, Transaction-related costs, Separation and Admission costs, andDisposals and others, in each case net of the impact oftaxes (where applicable) (collectively, the \" Adjusting Items \", which are defined at paragraph 5.2 of Part VI (Selected Financial Information )). The Directors believe that Adjusted Results, when considered together with the Group's operating resultsas reported under IFRS, provide investors, analysts andother stakeholders with helpful complementaryinformation to understand the financial performance andposition of the Group from period to period and allowthe Group's performance to be more easily comparedagainst the majority of its peer competitors. 52 As Adjusted Results include the benefits of restructuring programmes but exclude significant costs (such asRestructuring costs, Transaction-related costs andSeparation and Admission costs) they should not beregarded as a complete picture of the Group's financialperformance as presented in accordance with IFRS. Inparticular, when significant impairments, Restructuringcosts and Separation and Admission costs areexcluded, Adjusted Results will be higher than IFRSresults. For information on the Adjusting Items and further commentary on Adjusted Results, see paragraph 4.2 ofPart VI ( Selected Financial Information ). Constant currency The Group's reporting currency is Pounds Sterling, but the Group's significant international operations give riseto fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. To neutraliseforeign exchange impact and to better illustrate thechange from one year to the next, the Group discussesits results both on an \"as reported basis\" or using\"actual exchange rates\" (\" AER \") (local currency results translated into Pounds Sterling at the prevailing foreignexchange rate) and using constant currency exchangerates (\" CER \"). To calculate results on a constant currency basis, prior year exchange rates are used torestate current year comparatives. The currencieswhich most influence the constant currency results ofthe Group and their exchange rates are shown in thebelow table. 2021 2020 2019 Average rates: USD/\u00a3 1.27CNY/\u00a3 8.86 8.91 8.82 Free cash flow Free cash flow is calculated as net cash inflow from operating activities plus cash inflows from the sale ofintangible assets, the sale of property, plant andequipment and interest received, less cash outflows forthe purchase of intangible assets, the purchase ofproperty, plant and equipment, distributions tonon-controlling interests and interest paid. The Directors believe free cash flow is meaningful to investors because it is the measure of the fundsgenerated by the Group available for distribution ofdividends, repayment of debt or to fund the Group'sstrategic initiatives, including acquisitions. The purposeof presenting free cash flow is to indicate the ongoingcash generation within the control of the Group aftertaking account of the necessary cash expenditures formaintaining the capital and operating structure of the 53 Group (in the form of payments of interest, corporate taxation and capital expenditure). Free cash flow conversion Free cash flow conversion is calculated as free cash flow, as defined above, divided by profit after tax. Free cash flow conversion is used by the Directors to evaluate the cash generation of the business relative toits profit, by measuring the proportion of profit after taxthat is converted into free cash flow as defined above. Net debt Net debt at a period end is calculated as short-term borrowings (including bank overdrafts and short-termlease liabilities), long-term borrowings (including long-term lease liabilities), and derivative financial liabilitiesless cash and cash equivalents and derivative financialassets. The Directors analyse the key cash flow items driving the movement in net debt to understand and assesscash performance and utilisation in order to maximisethe efficiency with which resources are allocated. Theanalysis of cash movements in net debt allows theDirectors to more clearly identify the level of cashgenerated from operations that remains available fordistribution after servicing the Group's debt. Organic revenue growth Organic revenue growth represents the change in organic revenue at CER from one accounting period tothe next. Organic revenue represents revenue, as determined under IFRS and excluding the impact of acquisitions,divestments and closures of brands or businesses,revenue attributable to manufacturing serviceagreements (\" MSAs \") relating to divestments and the closure of sites or brands, and the impact of currencyexchange movements. Revenue attributable to MSAs relating to divestments and production site or brand closures has beenremoved from organic revenue because theseagreements are transitional and, with respect toproduction site closures, include a ramp-down period inwhich revenue attributable to MSAs gradually reducesseveral months before the production site closes. Thisrevenue reduces the comparability of prior and currentyear revenue and is therefore adjusted for in thecalculation of organic revenue growth. Organic revenue is calculated period-to-period as follows, using prior year exchange rates to restatecurrent year comparatives: \u0081 current year organic revenue excludes revenue from brands or businesses acquired in the currentaccounting period; 54 \u0081 current year organic revenue excludes revenue attributable to brands or businesses acquired in theprior year from 1 January to the date of completionof the acquisition; \u0081 prior year organic revenue excludes revenue in respect of brands or businesses divested or closedin the current accounting period from 12 monthsprior to the completion of the disposal or closureuntil the end of the prior accounting period; \u0081 prior year organic revenue excludes revenue in respect of brands or businesses divested or closedin the previous accounting period in full; and \u0081 prior year and current year organic revenue excludes revenue attributable to MSAs relating todivestments and production site closures takingplace in either the current or prior year, each an \" Organic Adjustment \". To calculate organic revenue growth for the period, organic revenue for the prior year is subtracted fromorganic revenue in the current year and divided byorganic revenue in the prior year. By way of example: \u0081 The Pfizer Transaction completed on 31 July 2019. Organic revenue growth for the period FY 2019 toFY 2020 excludes revenue attributable to brandsacquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction inrespect of the period 1 January 2020 to 31 July2020. \u0081 The Group completed the disposal of Breathe Right on 1 October 2020. Organic revenue growth for theperiod FY 2019 to FY 2020 excludes revenueattributable to Breathe Right from the period1 October 2019 to 31 December 2019. Organicrevenue growth for the period FY 2020 to FY 2021excludes revenue attributable to Breathe Right inFY 2020. The Directors believe that discussing organic revenue growth contributes to the understanding of the Group'sperformance and trends because it allows for ayear-on-year comparison of revenue in a meaningfuland consistent manner. For a reconciliation of the closest measures prepared in accordance with IFRS to the applicable non-IFRS measures, see paragraph 5 of Part VI ( Selected Financial Information ). 6.5 Currency presentation The Group's financial information is presented in Pounds Sterling. The abbreviations '\u00a3m' or '\u00a3million' represent millions of Pounds Sterling, and references to 'pence' and 'p' representpence in Pounds Sterling. 55 6.6 Rounding of figures Certain financial information presented in tables in this Prospectus has been rounded to the nearest whole number or the nearest decimal place. Therefore, the sum of the numbers in acolumn may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that column. In addition, certainpercentages presented in the tables in this Prospectus reflect calculations based upon theunderlying information prior to rounding, and, accordingly, may not conform exactly to thepercentages that would be derived if the relevant calculations were based upon the roundednumbers. Certain percentage shareholdings have also been rounded and therefore totals ofsuch percentage shareholdings may vary slightly from their actual arithmetic totals. 7. Pfizer's interest in the Group As at the date of this Prospectus, Pfizer's 32 per cent. interest in the Group is held by PFCHH, which holds all of the JVCo B Ordinary Shares, representing 32 per cent. of the voting rightsand 24.62 per cent. of the nominal value of CH JVCo. PFCHH is a direct wholly ownedsubsidiary of Anacor and both are wholly owned subsidiaries of Pfizer. Prior to the Demerger,Pfizer intends to undertake an intragroup reorganisation resulting in Pfizer becoming the directsole owner of PFCHH. Accordingly, except where otherwise stated, references in this Prospectus, including in the structure charts in Part IV ( Overview of the Demerger and Separation ), to the ownership of, or transfer to the Company (pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Exchange Agreement), of PFCHHby Pfizer and to the issuance of Haleon Shares and Non-Voting Preference Shares to Pfizerassume that this reorganisation takes place prior to the Demerger as expected. However, inthe event that the PFCHH Transfer is not completed by the time of completion of theDemerger, then Anacor shall be the entity holding the ownership interests in PFCHH that are tobe transferred to the Company pursuant to the Pfizer Exchange Agreement and, inconsideration of such transfer, the Company shall issue Haleon Shares and Non-VotingPreference Shares to Anacor. In addition, references in this Prospectus to Pfizer's or Anacor's interest in 32 per cent. of the Haleon Shares include both Haleon Shares and Haleon ADSs in respect of such HaleonShares. Pfizer will continue to own its 32 per cent. ownership interest in the Company following Separation. Pfizer has informed the Company that it intends to exit its position in the Companyin a disciplined fashion, with an objective of maximising value for Pfizer shareholders. 8.

Key highlights1 The Directors believe that the Group is an exceptional business: a business with significant global scale and reach with leading market share positions, differentiated by its 100 per cent.focus on consumer healthcare and driven by its purpose of delivering better everyday healthwith humanity. Its leading brands are built on science, innovation and human understandingand are trusted by millions of consumers globally. The Group is a world leader in consumer healthcare and is the leading business by sales in OTC, in VMS and Therapeutic Oral Health . 2The Group's portfolio of category-leading brands includes Toothpaste for sensitivity,3the world's leading Multivitamin, the world's leading Topical Pain Relief brand, the world's leading Denture Care brand and abroad range of other large-scale, well-known consumer healthcare brands with a leading globalor regional presence. The Group operates in a market that was worth over \u00a3160 billion in 2021 and is more relevant than ever following the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumers are increasingly conscious of theirhealth and, supported by greater digital resources, are willing to take greater ownership oftreatment and prevention. This trend is further accelerated in emerging markets by a growingmiddle-class population with a greater willingness to pay for OTC and wellness products. Inaddition, an ageing population across many countries drives greater demand for many of theproducts in the Group's categories; for example, the requirements for arthritis pain relief and forDenture Care products are linked with age. Similarly, governments, facing pressure onhealthcare spending driven by an ageing population, have adopted policy measures designedto increase the use of OTC drugs (which are not generally reimbursed by governments)relative to prescription drugs (typically reimbursed). The Directors expect these trends tocontinue. Underpinned by these and other favourable market factors, the Directors anticipatetypical annual market growth of between 3 and 4 per cent. over the medium-term. The Group has a strong footprint in the world's consumer healthcare markets, including a commercial presence in over 170 markets and a number one or two OTC/VMS market positionin countries which represented over 70 per cent. of the world's OTC/VMS markets by value in2021. This includes OTC/VMS market leadership in the USA and the leading OTC/VMSmultinational position in the higher growth markets of China and India. The Group's scale and brand portfolio is complemented by its well-developed capabilities in trusted science and human understanding. The Group has a longstanding in-house scientificcapability deriving from its pharmaceutical heritage, which allows it to both innovate and buildtrust through constructive engagement with the scientific community. The Group's scientificcapabilities are combined with a deep understanding of the health needs of its consumers,supported by consumer insights and broad engagement with healthcare professionals.Significantly, the Group engages directly with approximately one third of the approximately10 million healthcare professionals relevant to its categories. The power of this combination isillustrated by the double-digit growth of Sensodyne over the past decade, which has beendriven by increasing public awareness of tooth sensitivity as a treatable condition, consumer-centric scientific innovation and the generation of evidence-based claims to support expertrecommendations. 1See paragraph 1 ( Market and Industry Data )o fPresentation of Financial and Other Information for further information on the use of market and industry data in this Prospectus. 2Source: Therapeutic Oral Health ranking is based on Group analysis of third party data from Nielsen, IRI, Intage, IQVIAConsumption Sales Data (2021-2022). Therapeutic Oral Health is defined as Therapeutic Toothpaste and Total DentalAppliance Care. 3Group analysis of 2020 third party market data. 59 The Group has been transformed through the synergistic combination of three leading consumer healthcare businesses since 2015, alongside a targeted programme to optimise itsoperating model, cost base and capabilities for the future. An extensive programme ofdivestments has sharpened the focus of the business through the divestment of growth-dilutivebrands and those outside of the Group's core categories. In addition, the extensive scientificand consumer products experience of its legacy businesses has been significantly enhancedby targeted investment in commercial and scientific capabilities, technologies and facilities,most notably in the digital sphere. The separation of the Group from GSK now offers a numberof further intangible benefits, including increased management focus, an infrastructure andorganisational design more closely aligned to consumer healthcare requirements, capitalallocation priorities tailored to the needs of the business and management incentives whichcan be focused on the specific priorities of the Group. Despite the net negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the business delivered above- market organic revenue growth in both FY 2020 and FY 2021 whilst successfully integratingthe Pfizer consumer healthcare business which became part of the Group on 31 July 2019.Over the period FY 2019 to FY 2021, the Group also achieved a meaningful improvement inAdjusted operating profit margin driven by the delivery of integration synergies and operationalefficiencies, while still increasing investment in its brands and capabilities. This was achieved inspite of adverse currency movements and the dilutive impact of divestments. Building on thisbase, the Group has a clear and focused strategy which the Directors believe will drivesustainable above-market growth and attractive shareholder returns based on four key pillars: \u0081Driving portfolio growth by increasing household penetration. While the Group's category-leading brands touch millions of consumers around the world, there remainssignificant headroom for further penetration 4across the portfolio. The Group has a clear strategy for driving penetration-led growth with the consumer as its focus and which it plansto accelerate and apply across its broader portfolio. \u0081Capitalising on new and emerging growth opportunities. The Group plans to build on its significant recent growth in e-commerce, leveraging its rapidly developing capabilities inthis area. Additionally, the Group's brand portfolio, extensive scale and powerfulroute-to-market provide the opportunity to expand brands into new markets where it has thereach and scale to succeed. Similarly, the greater size of the combined legacy GSK andPfizer consumer healthcare businesses in certain markets (relative to the legacy GSK andPfizer businesses alone) continues to offer the opportunity to scale up key brands whichpreviously lacked local distribution scale. Further opportunities exist in Rx-to-OTC switchesin the USA, an area where the Group has led the market over the last decade, and inaccelerating consumer trends such as the growth of the Naturals segment (as definedbelow), where multiple launches are already underway with more planned. \u0081Performance underpinned by strong execution and financial discipline. The Group is focused on first class commercial execution, increasingly supported by digital tools. Inaddition, it has a strong culture of financial discipline and continuous improvement. Thiscombination has allowed it to deliver meaningful margin improvements since FY 2019,whilst increasing investment in its brands. The Group's strategy is to build on this trackrecord, maintaining its focus on commercial execution, business optimisation and costcontrol, thereby enabling it to deliver sustainable moderate margin expansion whilecontinuing to invest for future growth. \u0081Running a responsible business. Running a responsible business is integral to the Group's purpose of delivering better everyday health with humanity and it believes it is wellplaced to have a positive impact. Its environmental, social and governance (\" ESG \") goals focus on tackling the environmental and social barriers to everyday health and drivinghealth inclusivity through the promotion and delivery of sustainable solutions. 4Penetration is the proportion of a population (in a defined geographic market or product category) that has purchased the relevant category, brand or product at least once in the stated period. 60 The Directors expect the Group's strategy to deliver medium-term annual organic revenue growth of 4 to 6 per cent. combined with sustainable moderate margin expansion on a constantcurrency basis, whilst supporting continued investment for growth in the business. In turn, theDirectors expect this anticipated growth to deliver attractive shareholder returns underpinnedby strong cash generation and an initial dividend which is expected to be at the lower end of a30 to 50 per cent. pay-out ratio (subject to Board approval). The Group proposes to maintain astrong investment grade balance sheet with a target net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of lessthan 3x by the end of 2024. The listing of the Company is the culmination of a seven year journey since the merger of the legacy GSK and Novartis consumer healthcare businesses to create a global leader inconsumer healthcare. The Group's world-class portfolio of brands, attractive geographicfootprint and strong capabilities leave it well positioned to benefit from favourable underlyingsector fundamentals. 2. Evolution of the Group The Group has been transformed since 2012 through progressive strategic M&A and divestments to create a world leader in consumer healthcare. The Group's scale has greatly expanded through the successful combination of the legacy GSK consumer healthcare business with the Novartis consumer healthcare business in 2015,and the subsequent combination of this business with the Pfizer consumer healthcare businessin 2019, reaching revenue of \u00a39.5 billion in FY 2021. In addition, the Group's focus has beensharpened since 2012 through the progressive divestment the GSK Nutritionalsbusinesses (including Lucozade, and the divestment by the Group ofnon-strategic OTC brands including its recent programme of divestments of non-strategic andgrowth-dilutive brands (with aggregate net proceeds from divested brands of \u00a31.1 billion)during the period from FY 2019 to FY 2021. This deliberate strategy has resulted in a portfoliomore focused on higher-growth categories, markets and channels. These transactions alsoprovided a catalyst for a broader transformation of the Group (see paragraph 2.5Transformation of the Group ). The key M&A milestones since 2012 in the Group's business are summarised below: Divest Non-strategic OTC Exit of beverages:Lucozade andRibena $13bnExit categories, formation Significant divestment programmeBuy out 2.1 Legacy GSK consumer healthcare business Prior to its combination with the Novartis consumer healthcare business in 2015, GSK's consumer healthcare business was already one of the world's leading OTC and Oral Healthcompanies with a long heritage in consumer healthcare products dating back to the 18thcentury, when its founding companies in Britain, the USA and Germany sold herbal products,laxatives, vitamins and soaps. 61 The Group sold a range of leading OTC brands (including Panadol, Fenbid, Tums and ENO) across Respiratory Health, Pain Relief, Digestive Health, Skin Health and Smokers' Health,together with a strong portfolio of Oral Health brands (including Sensodyne, Polident andparodontax). Geographically, the GSK consumer healthcare business had a strong presence inhigher-growth emerging markets in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, which complemented itsbusinesses in Europe and North America. 2.2 Joint venture with Novartis On 2 March 2015, GSK and Novartis formed a consumer healthcare joint venture to combine the majority of GSK's consumer healthcare business and all of Novartis' OTC business (asfurther described in paragraph 15.1 of Part XII ( Additional Information )). Novartis' business provided GSK with a meaningful incremental presence in OTC, including several major brands,notably Voltaren, 5Theraflu, Excedrin and Otrivin. The combination added a leading portfolio of globally recognised consumer-preferred and expert-recommended brands in the Pain Relief,Respiratory Health, Smokers' Health and Skin Health categories to the Group's business.Geographically, Novartis' presence in Central and Eastern Europe combined with GSK'sstrength in these and other emerging markets presented multiple new growth opportunitiesacross the combined portfolio. In June 2018, GSK acquired Novartis' shareholding in the GSK/Novartis JV for $13 billion, enabling GSK to take full operational and strategic control of the business (as further describedin paragraph 15.1 of Part XII ( Additional Information )). 2.3 Joint venture with Pfizer On 31 July 2019, GSK completed a transaction with Pfizer to combine substantially all of GSK and Pfizer's respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new world-leading consumerhealthcare joint venture (as further described in paragraph 15.2 of Part XII ( Additional Information )). The transaction, which was transformational to the scale of the Group's business, brought together two businesses with highly complementary geographic footprints and brand portfolios.While the Group retained its strong European footprint, completion of the transaction alsoprovided the Group with incremental geographical scale in the USA, where it became theleader in OTC/VMS, and in China, where it became the leading OTC/VMS multinational. Froma portfolio perspective, the transaction provided the Group with global leadership in the higher-growth VMS market (key brands: Centrum, Caltrate and Emergen-C), as well as a leadingpresence in the US pain relief market through the acquisition of Advil, complementing theGroup's existing Pain Relief portfolio under the Panadol, Voltaren, Fenbid and Excedrinbrands. Since completion, GSK has owned 68 per cent. of the ordinary shares inGlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings (No.2) Limited (the entity through which bothGSK and Pfizer hold their equity interests in the joint venture and the current holding companyof the Group's business) with Pfizer holding the remaining 32 per cent. of the ordinary sharesin CH JVCo. The legacy Pfizer business has now been fully integrated into the Group. 2.4 Divestment of OTC and skin care non-core brands Alongside integration of the Pfizer consumer healthcare business, the Group exited approximately 50 non-strategic and growth-dilutive OTC and skincare assets from 2019 to2021 to raise \u00a31.1 billion of net proceeds. These disposals have further focused the businesson higher-growth categories, markets and channels and thereby enhanced the growth profile ofthe Group. 5Voltaren is a Novartis brand licensed to the Group exclusively for OTC products. 62 2.5 Transformation of the Group The transactions summarised above have acted as a catalyst for a much broader transformation of the Group, which is summarised below. 1. Portfolio reshaped, well positioned for growthThe portfolio changes since 2015 have resulted in a group that has been repositioned towards higher, above-market growth. The share of sales driven from the the \" Power Brands \"), which together have higher revenue growth than the overall Group (and generally have higher gross margins), hasincreased from 44 per cent. in 2015 to 58 per cent. in FY 2021 and the 2019-21 divestmentprogramme has eliminated a significant drag on overall growth. 6The Pfizer Transaction provided the Group with a significantly greater presence in higher-growth categories, notablybuilding a leadership position in VMS which has a higher-growth rate than other categories 7 and represented 16 per cent. of Group revenue in FY 2021 compared to 1 per cent. in 2015.Similarly, investments made in digital commerce have meaningfully increased the Group'spresence in the high growth e-commerce/digital channel, which grew from less than 1 per cent.of revenue in 2015 to 8 per cent. of revenue in 2021. The Group is also well-positioned in keygeographies following the Novartis and Pfizer transactions. The Group has leading positions inthe world's top two OTC/VMS markets with OTC/VMS market leadership in the USA (first in2021 compared to fourth in 2015) and the leading OTC/VMS multinational position in China(second overall in 2021 compared to fourteenth in 2015). These two markets accounted forover 40 per cent. of Group revenue in FY 2021 and its leading presence in these two marketsprovides the Group with a strong platform for future growth. 2. Optimised operating model, lean cost base and capabilities improvedSince 2015, the Group has made significant improvements to its footprint and operating model, thereby delivering a sustainable increase in operating profit margin to support reinvestment inbrands, capabilities and tools to support growth. The Group has significantly reduced its manufacturing site footprint. The 41 sites inherited from the legacy Novartis, Pfizer and GSK consumer healthcare businesses since 2015 have beenreduced to 24 in 2022. Similarly, warehousing and distribution centres have been reduced fromover 200 inherited to approximately 90 in 2022 and R&D sites have been consolidated fromnine inherited to four in 2022. In parallel, the Group has significantly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of its advertising and promotion spend. In particular, the Group doubled its digital media spendbetween FY 2019 and FY 2021, with enhanced targeting and a focus on return on investment.Digital media spend represented approximately 50 per cent. of total media expenditure in FY2021 and in the USA and China in particular, most of the Group's advertising and promotionspend is now digital with more to come in other markets. The Group has also rebalanced thespend behind its Power Brands to drive future growth from its biggest opportunities, andincreased consumer-facing advertising and promotion. Finally, the Group has evolved its operating model and enhanced its capabilities to support stronger execution. Local markets have been increasingly empowered to innovate, improvingthe Group's agility to adapt to changing local needs. Significant investments have been madein data and tools to drive improved data-led decision-making and stronger returns on theGroup's investments. In addition, specialised tools have been built that enable better 6Over 90 per cent. of the sales of OTC and skincare brands divested had negative growth based on compound revenue growth on a CER basis over the two years prior to divestment for brands divested in 2019 and three years for brands divested in 2020or 2021. 7Source: Nicholas Hall Consumer Healthcare 2017-21 sales growth at MSP. 63 execution, including, for example, the Group's shopper science labs, which enable commercial teams to experiment with retail experiences and provide category management analysis inpartnership with retailers in each of the Group's regions. 3. Delivering momentum while investing for growthThe Group's strategy since 2019 has delivered strong financial results with good momentum for the future, despite a net negative effect from the COVID-19 pandemic and the focus onintegration of the Pfizer assets and separation activities. Since FY 2019, the Group's revenue has increased by 12.6 per cent. to \u00a39.5 billion in FY 2021. This reflects the incorporation of the Pfizer business (only 5 months was included in FY 2019as the transaction closed on 31 July 2019) and underlying business growth, partially offset bydivestments and adverse foreign exchange movements. The Group's organic revenue growthexceeded 2019-2021 market growth, with 2.8 per cent. organic revenue growth in FY 2020 8 and 3.8 per cent. organic revenue growth in FY 2021. The Group's FY 2020 organic revenuegrowth does not, however, fully reflect the FY 2019 to FY 2020 growth of the current brandportfolio as it excludes the January to July revenue for the legacy Pfizer brands in FY 2019 andFY 2020 and the figures also include growth-dilutive brands which no longer form part of theGroup's portfolio. In terms of profitability, the Group delivered a robust gross profit margin of 62 per cent. and Adjusted gross profit margin of 63 per cent. in FY 2021, demonstrating the strength of itsbrands, its optimised manufacturing footprint, and continued focus on price, cost of goods soldand efficiencies to offset inflation. The Directors believe this margin is sustainable. In addition,the Group has almost fully delivered on the \u00a3500 million synergies projected at the time of thePfizer Transaction in 2019 and expects to realise around a further \u00a3120 million of synergies in2022, taking the total to around \u00a3600 million. Overall, the Group delivered an operating profitmargin of 17.2 per cent. and Adjusted operating profit margin of 22.8 per cent. in FY 2021, anincrease of 6.6 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively, since FY 2019despite adverse currency impacts. Over the same period, the Group reinvested a share ofoperating cost savings into advertising and promotion spend on brands to support futuregrowth. Finally, in terms of cash flow, the Group delivered \u00a31.4 billion net cash inflow fromoperating activities in both FY 2020 and FY 2021 driven by the underlying profitability of thebusiness, a disciplined approach to working capital (including a reduction in inventory anddebtor days) and stable capital expenditure. 8The FY 2020 growth rate calculated on an organic basis was negatively impacted by uneven consumer buying patterns in FY 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic which overlapped with the first twelve months following the Pfizer Transaction.Specifically, the calculation of organic revenue in FY 2020 excludes revenue attributable to the brands acquired as part of thePfizer Transaction in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 July 2020 (see Presentation of Financial and Other Information above) and includes revenue attributable to these brands for the period 1 August 2020 to 31 December 2020. Revenue during theformer period was high, driven by accelerated consumer purchases at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenueduring the latter period was negatively impacted by a reduction in consumer inventories (see also paragraphs 2.1, 2.14 and 5.1ofOperating and Financial Review ). The calculation also includes revenue up to the point of sale for low growth divested brands, which no longer form part of the Group's portfolio. 64 PART II MARKET OVERVIEW 1. Consumer Healthcare: a \u00a3160+ billion market9 The global consumer healthcare market is one of the largest, most resilient and fastest-growing across the FMCG sectors. However, unlike other standard FMCG markets, its definition variesacross competitors and common industry data sources. OTC/VMS is a major part of themarket, a primary focus of the Group's key competitors and is currently valued at over\u00a3135 billion. In addition to OTC/VMS, many peer companies compete in adjacent consumerhealthcare markets. For example, the Group and two of its largest consumer healthcare peerscompete in Oral Health, currently valued at \u00a325 billion globally. Therefore, the Group's definition of the consumer healthcare market comprises: OTC/VMS and Oral Health, which have an aggregate global market size of over \u00a3160 billion. 10Further information on the Group's categories is set out in paragraph 3 of this Part II ( Market Overview ) below. Health2018 2019 2020 2021-2017-2021 \u00a3bn The Group's largest single market is the USA, which is the number one consumer healthcare market globally with \u00a341 billion in consumer sales in 2021, representing approximately 27 percent. of the global market. The Group also has strong presence across Europe and China, aswell as in many other higher-growth markets, in particular China, which present an attractiveopportunity to increase household penetration of the consumer healthcare category. 2. Key market drivers The market fundamentals shaping future growth in the consumer healthcare market, which current expectations suggest could grow at a rate of 3-4 per cent. per annum over the medium-term, include the five key drivers below. Increased consumer focus on health and wellnessIn the period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, global consumers were increasingly taking a more active role in self-management of their health and wellbeing. Since the outbreak of the 9See paragraph 4 ( Market and Industry Data )o fPresentation of Financial and Other Information for further information on the use of market and industry data in this Prospectus. 10Total 2021 market size of \u00a3161 billion based on Group analysis of third party market data. 65 pandemic, personal healthcare has become even more relevant and this trend has accelerated. 2020 customer research found that 42 per cent. of consumers try to makewellness a priority in their day-to-day life, and 79 per cent. think wellness is important. 71 percent. of those consumers place a higher priority on their health than they did two to three yearsago, and 70 per cent. anticipate health growing in their list of priorities looking forward. 11This represents an important driver in the growth of self-care and underpins favourable trends forthe sector as a whole. Ageing populationsThe proportion of people aged 65 years and over is expected to increase from 9.3 per cent. of the global population in 2020 to 16.0 per cent., or approximately one in six people globally, in2050. 12This change in demographics brings with it increased need for self-care and preventative care. Emerging middle classThe emerging middle class in higher-growth economies has been a long term growth driver for the consumer healthcare market as greater buying power has led to greater per capita usage.Emerging and higher-growth economies continue to represent a sizeable growth opportunityfor the industry: per capita usage for combined OTC/VMS products in the USA was \u00a3110 percapita in 2021; and Western European OTC/VMS usage per capita was \u00a353 in the sameperiod. 13By comparison, per capita usage in higher-growth markets, including China (2021 OTC/VMS of \u00a322 per capita), Central and of \u00a329 per capita),India (2021 OTC/VMS of \u00a313 percapita), 14is still relatively low, which presents an attractive opportunity to increase household penetration of the consumer healthcare category. Growing self-care in the face of increasing pressure on public health systemsPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, pressure on public health had been rising over the long term. In 2018, global spending on health reached $8.3 trillion, or 10 per cent. of global GDP, growingslightly below GDP for the first time in five years. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and iscontinuing to have, a significant adverse impact on health systems globally, and the aftermathof the pandemic may be accompanied by a potentially deep global economic crisis which couldhave a long-lasting impact on future health financing. 15As such, the consumer healthcare market, and more specifically the ability to help consumers to self-care in general, represents amajor opportunity to reduce the current significant burden on public health. Sizeable unmet consumer needsCompetition in the consumer healthcare market is partly driven by innovation designed to meet unmet consumer needs. Through targeted innovation to address emerging trends - such asthe growing demand for natural ingredients, as well as premiumisation (where consumersswitch their purchases to premium alternatives), increased consumer interest in personalisedproducts, and emerging technologies that allow consumers to more directly manage their ownhealth - the Directors believe there is a sizeable opportunity for further growth. 11Source: McKinsey & Company, The Future of Wellness H1 2021 Report.

The key market categories for the Group OTC/VMSWithin the consumer healthcare market, OTC is distinct in that it is defined primarily by its regulatory status (see also Part X ( Regulatory Overview ) for further information on relevant regulations). OTC medicines are readily available to consumers in retail distribution channels(including pharmacies) without the need for a doctor's prescription. OTC comprises severalcategories defined by specific consumer needs and competition is at the category level. The Group's OTC business is focused on three of the largest categories: Respiratory Health (\u00a323 billion market), Pain Relief (\u00a316 billion market) and Digestive Health and Other (\u00a344 billionmarket). In Digestive Health and Other, the Group has a significant presence in DigestiveHealth (\u00a315 billion market), Skin Health (OTC Dermatologicals only, \u00a317 billion market) andSmokers' Health (\u00a31.3 billion market of the broader \u00a313 billion Lifestyle OTC market). Currentexpectations suggest that the OTC sector could grow by approximately 2 to 3 per cent. perannum over the medium-term. 16 In contrast to the broader FMCG marketplace, OTC is highly regulated, with a regulatoryenvironment that differs by country and respective regulator. Most OTC innovations andconsumer benefit claims must pass a rigorous approval process including pharmaceutical-likeclinical testing. Distribution is also heavily regulated: in many countries, OTC medicines aretypically available only via the pharmacy channel, although the USA, Australia and UK, wheremass market distribution is permitted, are notable exceptions. While the associated regulatoryenvironment tends to lead to a slower innovation cycle versus typical FMCG, it provides asignificant competitive advantage to businesses such as the Group with strong scientificcapabilities and strong pharmacy and retail channel execution infrastructure and capabilities. Competition in OTC is characterised by scientific innovation designed to fulfil unmet consumer needs and is supported by FMCG consumer branding and marketing. Innovations can includeimproved efficacy, new product formats, innovative packaging, and new consumer benefitclaims. Historically, the Rx-to-OTC switch, through which a medicine or class of medicinespreviously only available via prescription is made readily available to retail consumers, hasbeen a significant growth driver. Switches take a relatively long time and require specificcapabilities and expertise, including scientific and regulatory resources, the ability to manageclinical trials, and the ability to actively engage with key opinion leaders and regulators. Respiratory Health comprises several sub-categories. The Group is the market leader in global Respiratory Health with a global number two position (excluding traditional Chinese Medicine)in the largest sub-category, Seasonal Cold and Flu, the number one position in TopicalDecongestants and the number four position in Allergy Care. Pain Relief can be further segmented into Systemic Pain Relief (where the medicine is ingested) and Topical Pain Relief (where the medicine is applied to the skin). The Group is theglobal market leader in Pain Relief overall as well as in both of these sub-categories. Digestive Health comprises a range of treatments to support healthy functioning of the gastrointestinal tract including, amongst others: Antacids, Laxatives, and fibre products. TheGroup is the market leader in Digestive Health globally, due to strong leadership in immediaterelief antacids in both developed and emerging markets. Skin Health is highly fragmented, with multiple subcategories. The largest of these are Wound Healers (the Group is number three globally), Antiseptics and Disinfectants, Anti-itch (numberfour globally), Acne Remedies, General Antifungals (number three globally), Feminine IntimateCare and Lip Care (number two globally). Additionally, the Group holds a global leadershipposition in OTC Cold Sore Treatments. 16Group's projection for medium term (3 - 5 year) market growth rates based on analysis of third party data. Projection is based on the Group's current brand / market footprint. 67 Smokers' Health, in which the Group holds the global number two position,17is one of several sub-categories comprising the Lifestyle OTC category. VMS is a \u00a352 billion market and is broad-based, highly fragmented and aligned to multiple specific consumer benefits. While it forms part of the broader OTC/VMS market, it is alsoadjacent to the broader Nutrition market and, as a result, different competitors may takedifferent views of the market (Nutrition, Dietary Supplements, etc.). The current expectation isthat the VMS sector could grow by 4 - 5 per cent. per annum over the medium-term. 18The Group competes in VMS products usually intended to supplement a consumer's diet,containing one or more dietary ingredients (including vitamins, minerals, herbs or otherbotanicals, amino acids, and other supplements). Formats can include pills, powders, food-likeforms (e.g. gummies), capsules, tablets, or liquids. The Group holds global number onepositions in three of the five largest VMS sub-categories: Multivitamins, Vitamin C Supplementsand Calcium Supplements. Unlike OTC medicines, VMS products are generally regulated inthe same way as foods by relevant government authorities (see also paragraph 4 of Part X(Regulatory Overview )), and products within this category are distributed across a wide range of consumer channels, including pharmacy, mass and specialty retail, and e-commerce. Theless complex VMS regulatory environment allows for a more rapid innovation cycle. However,the comparatively limited constraints and barriers to entry enable smaller or local players toenter and compete within this growing category. Oral HealthThe \u00a325 billion Oral Health market is the most representative of a \"true\" FMCG category within the Group's consumer healthcare portfolio, albeit one that often requires differentiatingscientific capabilities to successfully compete for market share. The Group holds the globalnumber three market share position in Oral Health overall and the number one position in theTherapeutic Oral Health sub-category. 19The Group also has leading positions in Toothpaste (number two in a \u00a313 billion market) and Denture Care (number one in a \u00a3915 million market).Other major sub-categories include Toothbrushes, Mouthwash, and Whitening. The currentexpectation is that the Oral Health sector could grow by approximately 3 to 4 per cent. perannum over the medium-term. 20 Regulation in relation to innovation, consumer benefit claims, and distribution is generally lesscomplex in the Oral Health market when compared to the OTC market, although someproducts in the Group's portfolio are classified as medicines and medical devices, particularlyin Therapeutic Oral Health and Denture Care. Therefore, innovation cycles are typically shorterand outperforming the market requires differentiation and strong consumer marketingcapabilities combined with a high degree of agility. Distribution is relatively widespread, withmost Oral Health brands readily available to consumers across all major distribution channels(including e-commerce). 4. Other key themes impacting the consumer healthcare market Competitive environmentCompetitive dynamics: The consumer healthcare market is highly competitive, with brands differentiating themselves through scientific claims, consumer-driven innovation (including newproduct development and claims), premiumisation and distinguished branding. Competitionalso leverages traditional FMCG capabilities including consumer and channel marketing. 17Note the Group's US Nicorette trade mark, under which the CH Group's US Smokers' Health business is commercialised, is licensed from Johnson & Johnson. 18Group's projection for medium term (3 - 5 year) market growth rates based on analysis of third party data.

Projection is based on the Group's current brand / market footprint. 68 Market consolidation: The OTC/VMS market is highly fragmented, with the top five players holding a combined global share of 17 per cent. in 2021. Smaller competitors are also highlyregionalised, slowing the pace of consolidation. In contrast, Oral Health is highly consolidatedwith the five largest competitors holding 61 per cent. of the market in 2021. Major competitors: The Group's competitors fall into four major groups: consumer healthcare businesses within large pharmaceutical companies; FMCG companies with businesses inoverlapping or adjacent categories; local competitors in specific markets (particularly in China);and retailer private label companies in the USA, UK, and Australia. Regional dynamics: The Group's two most significant markets are the USA and China. These markets had aggregate market revenue of \u00a341 billion and \u00a335 billion 21respectively in 2021. In the USA, the Group holds the number one position in OTC/VMS and the number four positionin Oral Health, with a number three position in Toothpaste and the leading position in DentureCare. In China, the Group holds the number two position in OTC/VMS (the number onemultinational) and is among the top ten in Oral Health. Retail and distributionOTC distribution is heavily weighted to the pharmacy channel globally (68 per cent. of global revenue), with approximately 25 per cent. in other retail (primarily mass market in the USA andUK and hospitals in China) and 7 per cent. of revenue in e-commerce. By contrast, VMS has agreater weighting in e-commerce, with 30 per cent. in e-commerce, 28 per cent. in other retailand 42 per cent. in pharmacy. Oral Health distribution closely mirrors the broader FMCGspace, with 55 per cent. of 2021 revenue in mass/grocery, 22 per cent. in pharmacy, and12 per cent. in e-commerce. A further 11 per cent. of Oral Health distribution comes from othermuch smaller channels, such as convenience. 22 Pharmacy channel: Pharmacy is the primary distribution channel for both OTC and VMS, comprising 68 per cent. and 42 per cent. respectively of distribution globally. The WesternEuropean pharmacy channel is both fragmented and highly regulated: Germany, France andSpain do not permit corporate ownership of pharmacies and, as a result, market participantsmust have the capabilities and infrastructure required to partner effectively with a large numberof individual store owners. While Italy is similarly regulated, corporate ownership of pharmaciesis permitted. The UK operates a parallel model, with mass market sales for some OTC/VMSproducts permitted, while other OTC products are confined to the traditional pharmacy. Similarto Western Europe, the bulk of Central and Eastern Europe operate on a pharmacy-regulatedmodel, with some corporate ownership permitted. This is also the predominant model in LatinAmerica and Asia. China also follows a primarily pharmacy model with a significant portion ofOTC medicines distributed through in-hospital pharmacies. In North America, the pharmacychannel primarily consists of large drug store chains (for example, CVS, Walgreens). Thesechains share many similarities with the mass/grocery channel (see below). Mass/grocery: Mass sales of OTC medicines are widely permitted in the USA and permitted for most OTC/VMS products in the UK and Australia. As a result, competition in these marketsrequires strong FMCG-based customer marketing capabilities, including category managementand collaborative planning with major retailers; and the scale necessary to partner with theworld's largest retailers. Notably, mass market retailers are both a distribution channel anddirect competition in the form of private label, making the ability to compete with private labelvia differentiating innovation and strong brand loyalty critical to success in the mass market. E-commerce: Online consumer healthcare sales have consistently grown at double digit rates since 2018 and this trend was accelerated by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 across all 21Sales of traditional medicines are included where they are packaged and positioned alongside registered OTCs. 22Source: Euromonitor Passport 2021 consumer sales at manufacturers ' selling prices. Mass/grocery as per Euromonitor's Grocery Retailers definition, pharmacy & drugstores as per Euromoni tor's Health and Beauty Specialist Retailers, e-commerce as per Euromonitor's e-commerce definitions. 69 regions. Online revenues are most significant to the Group in the USA and China, with Germany and the UK leading online revenues in Europe. While this trend could be viewed asdisruptive to the traditional status quo and distribution, the resulting increased consumeravailability also represents an opportunity to drive a longer-term increase in both penetrationand category growth. Increasing market share in this evolving segment is dependent on havingthe right capabilities to capitalise on this trend, as well as having invested sufficiently to equipthe business to adapt to fulfilling consumer needs in this channel. 70 PART III BUSINESS OVERVIEW 1. Strengths23 The Group is one of the world's leading consumer healthcare businesses with an exceptional portfolio of brands across its key categories and a strong footprint across the world's largestand fastest growing OTC/VMS and Oral Health markets. The Group is further distinguished by leading consumer healthcare-focused scientific capabilities, a well-developed organisational understanding of human health behaviours, strongcapabilities in brand building, innovation and digital commerce and a powerful route-to-market. The Directors believe these represent important competitive strengths, which will support sustainable above-market medium-term growth and attractive shareholder returns. 1.1 Exceptional portfolio of category-leading brands The Group's business is built on an exceptional and focused portfolio of trusted consumer healthcare brands in attractive categories which provide meaningfulopportunities for growth. The Group is a global leader in the consumer healthcare market with number one global category positions in Therapeutic Oral Health , 24VMS, Pain Relief, Respiratory Health and Digestive Health. Across these key categories, the Group has an exceptional portfolio oftrusted brands with category-leading positions at a global or local level, including four out of theworld's top ten OTC/VMS brands by revenue. 25 The Group's leading brands Oral HealthMarket RankPower brandsLocal strategic brandsVMS 2021. these nine brands, Voltaren, Advil, Centrum are the number one or number two brand in their respective 23See paragraph 1 ( Market and Industry Data )o fPresentation of Financial and Other Information for further information on the use of market and industry data in this Prospectus. 24Group analysis of third party data from (Nielsen, IRI, Intage, IQVIA Consumption Sales Data (2021-2022). Therapeutic Oral Health is defined as Therapeutic Toothpaste and Total Dental Appliance Care. 25Excluding traditional Chinese medicine . 71 sub-categories globally.26In addition, Panadol is the leading Systemic Pain Relief brand outside of the USA, Theraflu has a strong regional European and North American presence inSystemic Cold and Flu and parodontax is amongst the world's fastest growing globalToothpaste brands. 27 The Power Brands are complemented by local strategic brands, which have scale andleadership positions in key markets. These include, among others, Fenbid (the number twoSystemic Pain Relief brand in China), Emergen-C (the number one immunity VMS brand in theUSA), Grand-Pa (the number one Pain Relief brand in South Africa), Dr.BEST (the leading Manual Toothbrush brand in Germany), ENO (the number one Digestive Health brand in Braziland India) and Tums (the leading Heartburn brand in the USA). 28 The combination of the Power Brands and local strategic brands provides the Group with afocused, complementary and trusted portfolio which offers scale advantages, meaningfulopportunities for growth and positions the Group well to maximise the return on innovation,advertising and promotion. 1.2 Attractive geographic footprint with strong presence in large and higher-growth markets The Group has an extensive footprint across the global consumer healthcare market and a leading position in the large US and Chinese markets. The Group's revenue iswell-balanced between developed and emerging markets. The Group has market-leading scale in the world's consumer healthcare markets, including a commercial presence in over 170 markets and a number one or two OTC/VMS position incountries representing over 70 per cent. of the global OTC/VMS market by value in 2021. The Group holds a leadership position in key scale and growth markets. This includes leadership in the approximately \u00a337 billion US OTC/VMS market (the largest market,representing over 27 per cent. of the total OTC/VMS market) and regional leadership in theapproximately \u00a331 billion European OTC/VMS market (approximately 23 per cent. of the totalOTC/VMS market). The Group also holds the leading multinational (\" MNC \") position in the key OTC/VMS growth markets of China and India (in both cases the Group is number two overall),together with market leadership in the Asia Pacific region and in the Middle East and Africa(\"MEA \"), (together, representing 44 per cent. of the total OTC/VMS market). In China, the Group is currently the number one multinational consumer healthcare business. Systemic Pain Relief (Nicholas Hall 2021). 27parodontax is amongst the fastest growing global Toothpaste brands based on Group analysis of Euromonitor Passport data (2021). 28Source: Nicholas Hall's DB6 Consumer Healthcare (OTC/VMS) Database (other than with respect to Dr. BEST); Euromonitor Passport Database with respect to Dr. BEST. 72 The following chart shows the Group's combined market ranking in OTC and VMS.29 The Group's scale in OTC/VMS is reinforced through its leadership position in Therapeutic Oral Health30and overall number three position in Oral Health. The Group benefits from a balance of revenue between developed and emerging markets with approximately one third of the Group's revenue delivered from emerging markets in FY 2021.The Directors expect emerging markets in aggregate to grow ahead of developed markets overthe medium-term driven by rising incomes and health awareness. 1.3 Human understanding and trusted science, exclusively focused on consumer health The Group has leading scientific capabilities focused exclusively on consumer healthcare combined with well-developed human understanding generated throughdedicated in-house expertise and a range of proprietary consumer insight tools. TheDirectors believe that the combination of human understanding and trusted sciencedrives better innovation and meaningful and positive engagement with both consumersand experts. Given the Group's pharmaceutical heritage, trusted science is firmly embedded in the Group's culture and approach, and the Directors believe it possesses scientific capabilities thatdifferentiate it from other FMCG companies. The Group has a dedicated consumer healthcareR&D organisation with a multidisciplinary talent pool of approximately 1,400 highly skilledscientists and a strong network of external partnerships. This is further supported by highquality R&D facilities which provide a range of capabilities, including fast prototyping, imaging,product chemistry, microbiology, stability analysis and scale-up and technical transfer. Since 2017, the Group has conducted nearly 70 clinical studies involving approximately 6,000 participants and has a strong track record of peer-reviewed journal publications and patentapplications. In addition, through its regulatory organisation which has a direct presence acrossapproximately 60 markets, it has completed approximately 19,000 regulatory applications andapprovals since 2019 in support of both new launches and the continuation of existingproducts. The Group's focus on trusted science and the generation of evidence-based claims supported by scientific research is also critical to the Group's ability to engage with experts andhealthcare professionals with whom it is widely recognised as a partner of choice. Trust isfundamental to these relationships and is embedded in the Group's culture. 29Source: Nicholas Hall's DB6 Consumer Healthcare (OTC/VMS) Database, 2021 Store and E-commerce sales. 30Group analysis of third party data from (Nielsen, IRI, Intage, IQVIA Consumption Sales Data (2021-2022). Therapeutic Oral Health is defined as Therapeutic Toothpaste and Total Dental Appliance Care. 73 Alongside its scientific strengths, the Group has developed a range of capabilities focused on understanding the health needs of its consumers and the barriers to treatment, and hasinvested heavily in consumer insights, data analytics and a range of digital tools. These includein-house shopper research facilities which enable sophisticated testing of consumer responsesto different retail scenarios, future trend spotting capabilities, and highly developed sensorylabs to source consumer feedback on the taste, texture and smell of the Group's products. Itssocial listening capability draws insights from over 70 million posts a year and its proprietary'Observatory' library holds 53,000 findings on concepts, conditions or culture, as they relate tohealth. The Group's extensive expert engagement generates further insights, including earlyvisibility of unmet consumer needs. The Directors believe the synthesis of trusted science and human understanding provides the Group with competitive advantages in product development and commercialisation. TheGroup's consumer understanding supports the identification and development of productsaddressing real consumer needs. Through its scientific capabilities, the Group is able todevelop innovative products which address these needs with claims backed by science andsupporting expert recommendation, which is a key driver of consumer healthcare performance.In parallel, the Group's consumer understanding supports product messaging which appeals toconsumers on an emotional level, as well as allowing the Group to target products and productmessaging to the relevant consumer audiences. 1.4 Strong brand building, innovation and digital capabilities combined with a leading route-to-market The Group has well-proven capabilities in building brands and campaigns that resonate with consumers and in delivering innovation to meet consumer healthcare needstogether with the ability to reach across all key channels for consumer healthcareproducts, including e-commerce. The Group has a track record of building trusted and enduring brands across different geographies and consumer populations and seeks to build real and personal connections in itscommunications with consumers, underpinned by its trusted science. This means making a linkto the broader context of consumers' needs, not merely focusing on functional benefits. Oneexample is the successful 2020 launch of Voltaren Arthritis Pain in the USA, following itssuccessful switch from prescription status. The promotional campaign focused on the brand'sability to restore the joy of movement to sufferers of arthritis pain, building upon the strongfunctional claims of the product but focusing on the human impact of pain relief. The launchwas supported by an innovative website, tailored to the needs of arthritis sufferers with voicesearch functionality, large tap targets, scalable font sizes, and the ability to view hands-freecontent via videos and head-gesture-scrolling. In its first year of sales, the launch outperformedany competitive OTC launch in the US Pain Relief market since 2011 31and drove more than 80 per cent. of Topical Pain Relief category growth in the US market in the year of launch.32 The Group's commercial organisation is supported by innovative facilities and tools includingits shopper science labs, the Group's own in-house content production studio, \"CaST\", andproprietary artificial intelligence tools which support dynamic content and media optimisation. The foundations of the Group's business lie in addressing real everyday health needs and thereby delivering penetration and growth. The Group has demonstrable capabilities in thedelivery of innovation based on human insights to address consumer needs. For example, inNorth America, the Group launched Tums Chewy Bites in 2017 having identified thatmillennials, whilst having high rates of heartburn, were reluctant to treat the condition due tonegative perceptions of the product taste and perceived lack of relevance to them. Thecolourful and fruit-flavoured chewy bites format addressed this perception whilst providing 31Source: IRI Consumption Data from Market Advantage and Xlerate, FY2011-FY2021. 32Source: Group analysis based on external data (IRI Market Advantage, Consumption Data). 74 convenience, a characteristic highly valued by this group. Building on the launch in 2017, the Group has continued to innovate through products with new flavours and sensory properties(for example, Chewy Bites Cooling Sensation), as well as products treating both heartburn andbloating. Continued innovation brought 3.8 million new consumers into the category in theUSA 33and drove US Tums Chewy 3 year compound consumer sales growth of 31 per cent. to November 2021.34 In addition to its marketing and innovation capabilities, the Group has a strong and establishedpresence in all key channels relevant for consumer healthcare and a scale which allows it toeffectively engage with retail partners of all sizes, buying groups, distributors, pharmacy chainsand individual pharmacies. In Europe, where the Group's products are primarily sold throughsmall-scale pharmacies, this supports the Group's number one ranking in the pharmacychannel and, in key European markets, country average weighted distribution 35levels in pharmacy for the Group's Power Brands of between 70 and 98 per cent. In mass market retail,the Group is ranked second and has weighted distribution in key European markets for itsPower Brands of between 76 and 94 per cent. 36In the mass channel in the USA and elsewhere, the Group benefits from strategic partnerships with large retailers, supported by itsstate-of-the-art shopper science labs which facilitate joint business planning. The Group has also invested significantly in building local e-commerce capabilities and strengthening strategic partnerships with global and local leaders. Alongside its digitalmarketing capabilities, this has enabled the Group to more than double its e-commerce salesbetween FY 2019 and FY 2021. A key part of the Group's global reach is also its ability to engage with experts and healthcare professionals who play a significant part in product recommendation. For example, in OTC/VMS, 85 per cent. of pharmacist recommendations lead to a purchase, and in Oral Health,studies have shown that dentist recommendations have a significant influence over oral healthbehaviours. As a result of its reach and focus on trusted science, many of the Group's leadingbrands across the portfolio are the number one recommended in their categories by experts inthe Group's major markets. 37 2. Strategy The Group has a clear and focused strategy to drive sustainable above-market growth and attractive returns, guided by its purpose of delivering better everyday health with humanity.This strategy is built on four pillars: growing the portfolio by driving household penetration,capitalising on new and emerging growth opportunities, strong execution and financialdiscipline and running a responsible business. 33Source: IRI National Consumer Panel Data, FY2016-FY2021. 34Source: IRI point of sale data, multi-outlet (MULO) + convenience + ecommerce Nov 2021. 35Weighted distribution is the percentage of points of sale where a product is available, assigning to each point of sale, a weight proportional to its sales. 36Based on Group analysis of distribution data for the Group's Power Brands (excluding Advil which is primarily a North American brand) in a cross section of European markets, including Poland, Germany, Great Britain, Italy and Spain. 37Based on surveys of healthcare professionals carried out in 2020 by Ipsos across 30 markets in the OTC and/or Oral Health categories. In the majority of cases, the Group's brands covered emerged as the brand recommended most often to patients bythe healthcare professionals surveyed. 75 2.1 Drive portfolio growth by increasing household penetration The Directors believe there is significant opportunity for further penetration of its brands across its categories. The Group has a clear and proven approach to drivingpenetration growth. Penetration in some of the Group's key categories is still relatively low, and the Directors expect to deliver significant continued growth from the Group's current portfolio. In Oral Health,nearly 1 in 3 adults have experienced sensitive teeth, but only 1 in 3 of those experiencingsensitivity use a sensitivity toothpaste like Sensodyne. 38In Pain Relief, 9 out of 10 people suffer from pain, but only 1 in 3 of them immediately treat their pain.39In China, where calcium intake is less than 50 per cent. of the daily recommended level40only approximately 17 per cent. of people take a calcium supplement like Caltrate.41 The Group has a clear and proven approach to driving penetration growth which utilises its keycapabilities in human understanding, trusted science, innovation and marketing, supported bystrong commercial execution. This can be illustrated by the successful growth of Sensodyne,which delivered over 10 per cent. compound revenue growth between FY 2011 and FY 2021. The Group's strategy for Sensodyne incorporates the building of condition awareness and relevance. Many sufferers of tooth sensitivity do not recognise it as a health condition and onewhich can be treated. The Group's communications address all sensitivity sufferers, using adata-driven approach to tailor relevant messages for different target audiences acrosschannels. Product innovation based on consumer insights has been a key driver of Sensodyne's growth.The Sensodyne product range has expanded well beyond the original formulation to offer arange of benefits in response to different consumer needs. The range now includes, amongstothers, Sensodyne Rapid Relief offering pain relief within 60 seconds; Sensodyne Pronamelwhich protects teeth against acid erosion; Sensodyne Repair and Protect which repairs,strengthens and protects sensitive teeth; and, more recently, Sensodyne Sensitivity and Gum,which has a clinically proven dual action formula for sensitive teeth and gum problems. In addition, expert advocacy has been a core strength of Sensodyne which is the number one dentist-recommended brand for sensitive teeth in 24 of 30 markets tracked. 42Dental recommendation has been built on the foundation of the Group's trusted science with science -backed claims developed by the Group and a large expert field force combined withHealthpartner, the Group's website for healthcare professionals ensuring awareness of thebenefits of Sensodyne products. Finally, the Group's commercial execution, both online and in-store, ensures that Sensodyne has high levels of visibility and the right assortment of packs to support commercialopportunities. 38Source: Oral Health Population Data - IPSOS Incidence Study Calculations 2015: figures are averages. 39Source: Edelman Intelligence, GP14, 2020, 19 markets, 19,000 respondents. 40Source: Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2021). 41Source: Penetration data from Kantar (2020). 42Source: Group analysis based on Ipsos data from expert performance tracking study 2019-2020. 76 The Group is applying the same approach as on Sensodyne across other brands and markets. For example, the Group's parodontax messaging focuses on raising consumer awareness ofgum disease with many sufferers of bleeding gums unaware that this is a sign of gum diseasewith the long-term risk of tooth loss. This has been supported by science-based product claims(\"parodontax is a toothpaste that is clinically proven to help reduce bleeding gums\") andinnovation of a range of different products focusing on different consumer needs including gumhealth, whitening, gum repair and complete protection. 2.2 Capitalise on new and emerging growth opportunities The Group plans to leverage its growing capabilities in e-commerce and expand its key brands across leading markets. It will continue to pursue Rx-to-OTC switches in theUSA and capitalise on accelerating consumer trends. Channel expansion: e-commerceOver recent years, partly driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant consumer shift to e-commerce with market compound e-commerce growth of approximately24 per cent. per annum between 2018 and 2021. 43The Directors expect this momentum to continue. As a result of the investments made in digital capabilities and strategic partnerships with leading e-commerce companies, the Directors consider the Group to be well positioned tocapitalise on e-commerce growth. This is grounded in the Group's strong recent performance.Since 2019, the Group has delivered above-market growth in e-commerce sales, which havegrown from 4 per cent. of revenue in FY 2019 to 8 per cent. in FY 2021 (constituting growth ofover \u00a30.4 billion in digital revenue). Significantly, the Group holds strong positions in moredeveloped e-commerce markets, such as China and the USA. In China, e-commerce revenuerepresented 20 per cent. of FY 2021 revenue with FY 2020 to FY 2021 growth of over 40 percent. In the USA, e-commerce revenue represented 12 per cent. of FY 2021 revenue and withFY 2020 to FY 2021 growth of over 35 per cent. E-commerce growth is a clear priority and anarea where the Group aims to build on the investments it has already made. Geographic expansionThe Directors believe that the Group's brand portfolio and powerful route-to-market capabilities offer multiple opportunities to expand its brands beyond their existing geographies. For example, in India and in many MEA markets, the business has a consistent performance track record and strong route-to-market with 4 million distribution points in India and 80 percent. weighted distribution across MEA. The Group has experienced double digit growth inMEA over the last two years and strong double digit growth in India over the last five years. Ineach case, however, the majority of revenue currently comes from a small number of brands.In FY 2021, over 75 per cent. of revenue in India was accounted for by ENO and Sensodyneand over 48 per cent. of revenue in MEA was derived from Panadol and Sensodyne. TheDirectors believe there is significant opportunity to leverage local capabilities to expand otherbrands in the portfolio into these and other markets. The Directors believe that its leading portfolio includes a number of brands which are well- positioned for geographic expansion. For example, poor gum health, a common conditionworldwide, offers opportunity for the expansion of parodontax into additional markets throughapplication of the same growth model as Sensodyne. The brand was launched in India in thesecond quarter of 2021 and has delivered strong initial performance. Additionally, Centrum, although present in over 70 markets, is highly concentrated geographically with approximately two thirds of revenue in FY 2021 coming from five markets.The Directors see an opportunity to grow the brand within its existing footprint by leveraging 43Source: Group analysis based on market data sourced from Nicholas Hall and Euromonitor. 77 the Group's scale and route-to-market. This is supported by recent experience in the EMEA and LatAm region with approximately 14 per cent. Centrum revenue growth in this region in FY2021 compared to FY 2020. Portfolio expansion: Rx-to-OTC switchesThe Group continues to pursue Rx-to-OTC switches which have historically been a key source of innovation and growth in OTC, especially in the USA. The Group has a strong track recordof switching both GSK and non-GSK products driven by a long-standing dedicated in-houseteam and has implemented four Rx-to-OTC switches in the USA since 2014. This includes themost recent switch of Voltaren Arthritis Pain in 2020, which drove 80 per cent. of marketrevenue growth in the Topical Pain Relief category in the USA in 2020. The Group currentlyhas two active switch projects in its pipeline with expected launches (if successful andapproved) in 2025 and 2026 and is exploring further opportunities both within and outside of itskey categories. Portfolio expansion: emerging consumer trends including NaturalsThe Group intends to continue to capitalise on accelerating consumer trends, for example, the growing consumer trend for natural products. Consumer healthcare products that arenon-medicated, 'free from' particular ingredients, or that include plant-based, herbal or othernaturally occurring ingredients (\" Naturals \") are increasingly popular, especially amongst younger consumers, with growth exceeding the market average. Consumers are increasinglylooking for natural products across disease prevention, treatment and recovery and theDirectors believe this trend will continue. The Group sees an opportunity to expand its Naturals offering across relevant portfolios and has launched 10 Naturals innovations since the beginning of FY 2021, including launches Voltanatura, and Tums Naturals. 25 furtherNaturals products are in the pipeline. 2.3 Underpin performance with strong execution and financial discipline The Group will continue to focus on driving efficiency, effectiveness and agility to make every investment count. The Group has made significant progress in recent years in driving efficiency effectiveness across its operations. Over the last seven years, the Group has optimised the manufacturingfootprint inherited from the legacy GSK, Novartis and Pfizer consumer healthcare businessesfrom 41 sites to 24, whilst restructuring its supply chain such that manufacturing is increasinglyco-located in the same region as the end consumer (80 per cent. of product supply sourcedwithin the same region). This allows the Group to manufacture at scale, whilst retaining thecost and responsiveness benefits of local sourcing. In the same period, the Group has morethan halved its number of distribution centres and has reduced its contract manufacturers fromapproximately 250 inherited from the legacy GSK, Novartis and Pfizer businesses toapproximately 180 in 2022, thereby gaining scale benefits and reducing management costs. Similarly, between 2019 and 2021, the Group's marketing organisation reduced its creative media and production agencies from 200 to 56 and the organisation has continued to optimisehow advertising and promotion spend is deployed with an increased focus on digital (doublingbetween FY 2019 and FY 2021 to almost half of advertising and promotion spend in FY 2021).Investments in AI tools such as People-Cloud and consumer data have significantly increasedthe efficiency of this expenditure. In 2021, the Group was able to deliver a 185 per cent. returnon data-driven media spend. 44 44Data-driven media spend is digital media spend targeting new consum ers identified by data-driven c onsumer segmentation. These consumers are served with media and messages relevant to their s pecific profiles. The 185 per cent. return refers to incremental revenue generated relative to digital media expenditure. 78 In terms of in-market commercial execution, the Group has empowered its local markets to innovate, increasing the Group's agility in adapting to changing consumer healthcare needs.800 R&D and category roles have been moved or re-aligned to local markets for 2022 and inthe USA, for example, approximately 68 per cent. of 2022 innovation projects are expected tobe locally managed. The Group has also built specialised tools that enable better localcommercial execution. For example, the Group's sales teams across EMEA and LatAm aresupported by a customer relationship management system which ensures sales representativecalls are efficient and effective. Through this system, representatives are able to complete theircommercial activities, capture instore excellence key performance indicators, and delivercategory and product training and education. The Group is also now utilising image recognitionand machine learning across many retail stores in order to ascertain distribution and visibilitymetrics that can then drive improvements with the objective of optimising sales. Similarly, theGroup's shopper science labs inform its commercial practices to improve the experience ofretailers and consumers. A sharp focus on net revenue management has been a further lever through which the Group has sought to optimise its margins, including strategic initiatives such as increased penetrationof Power Brands in key markets such as India (typically Power Brands have higher marginsthan the Group as a whole) and increased focus on improving returns on trade investmentspend. These initiatives have positively impacted margins and supported approximately 2.2 percent. price growth in 2021 (excluding divested brands and at CER), complementing anapproximately 1.8 per cent. growth in volumes (excluding divested brands). The Group's strategy of efficient commercial execution and cost discipline allows it to deliver moderate operating profit margin expansion whilst reinvesting a share of cost savings deliveredin future growth through targeted investment in advertising and promotion, and innovation. Thisin turn supports delivery of increased growth and growth in free cash flow creating furtheroperating leverage and efficiencies. Between FY 2019 and FY 2021, the Group successfully increased operating profit margin and Adjusted operating profit margin by 6.6 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points,respectively, despite an adverse foreign exchange movement and an adverse impact fromdivestment of growth-dilutive brands which received limited advertising and promotion support.Over the same period, the Group reinvested a share of operating cost savings into advertisingand promotion spend on brands to support future growth. The Group has additionally delivered net cash inflow from operating activities of \u00a33.5 billion and free cash flow of \u00a33.8 billion, in each case across the period FY 2019-2021. Healthy cashflows from operations have been strongly supported by a sharp focus on working capitaldiscipline and stable capital investment. The Group is a business with strong operating profit margin (FY 2021: operating profit margin of 17.2 per cent. and Adjusted operating profit margin of 22.8 per cent.) with above-marketgrowth supported by robust investment in its brands (FY 2021: advertising and promotionexpenditure as a percentage of revenue of 20.3 per cent., R&D costs as a percentage ofrevenue of 2.7 per cent. and Adjusted R&D costs as a percentage of revenue of 2.6 per cent.).The Group's strategy is to maintain its sharp focus on business optimisation and cost controlwhilst reinvesting a share of savings for future growth. This includes the delivery of theremaining synergies from the integration of the Pfizer consumer healthcare business, otherongoing projects in net revenue management and manufacturing and further operational costssavings. 79 2.4 Run a responsible business The Group's responsible business agenda is intrinsically linked to its sector focus and its purpose of delivering better everyday health with humanity. The Group has astructurally advantaged environmental footprint in its sector and is strongly positionedto advance health inclusivity. The Group is committed to building strong corporategovernance across the business. Running a responsible business is intrinsically linked to the Group's purpose and integral to how the organisation operates. The Group recognises that the health of the world'senvironment affects the health of people and is committed to tackling the environmental andsocial barriers to everyday health. The Group's brands have clear and positive roles to play inprotecting and improving everyday health and doing so in inclusive and responsible ways. The Group has a relatively small environmental footprint in terms of carbon intensity (2020 Carbon intensity scope 1-3 0.2kg CO2e/\u00a3 of revenue) and plastic packaging (2020 plasticpackaging footprint of approximately 50,000 tonnes). This is driven by the nature of its productportfolio, a significant part of which is made up of precisely-dosed, small-sized premiumproducts which are bought and typically used over an extended period of time and whichtherefore utilise less energy for manufacturing and plastic for packaging per \u00a3 of revenue. Afurther structural advantage is that the Group's products are less exposed to agriculturalingredients which require high resource intensity in manufacturing. Such structural advantagesprovide the Group with a strong foundation in terms of reduced risk exposure and the requiredcapital expenditure to further advance its environmental and social agenda. In addition, theGroup has a lower financial exposure to carbon taxation, plastic regulations or taxation, andrising energy costs. The Group's environmental focus is to tackle the barriers to everyday health, focusing on carbon footprint and climate change, sustainable healthcare packaging, and using trustedingredients that are sustainably sourced. The Group's targets include: 100 per cent. reductionin scope 1 & 2 (internal operational) carbon emissions by 2030 (versus its 2020 baseline);42 per cent. reduction in scope 3 (from source to sale) by 2030; and 100 per cent. recyclable orreusable packaging by 2030 versus its 2020 baseline (where quality, safety and regulationspermit, given the strict regulation of packaging requirements for certain healthcare products).As a standalone business, the Group will set a longer-term carbon net zero goal informed bythe latest Science Based Targets initiative (\" SBTi \") guidance. 45 The Group has a track record of delivering against these targets: 100 per cent. of electricity used by the Group comes from renewable sources; renewable electricity generation has beenimplemented at 12 out of its 24 manufacturing sites; and new solutions are being developed tosupport delivery of a significant reduction in the use of virgin petroleum-based plastic. Theseinclude sustainably-sourced Pulpex plastic toothbrushes; and recycle-ready toothpaste tubes on track to reach one billiontubes using recyclable plastic by 2025 (in line with Group's target for all packaging to berecyclable or reusable by 2030). The Group sees health inclusivity or a lack of it as a critical factor for everyday health and believes its leading global position in the consumer healthcare market offers it the opportunityto make a meaningful positive impact in this area. The Group has set a target to help 50 millionpeople per annum by 2025 to gain access to opportunities for better everyday healthirrespective of their age, physical and mental capabilities, gender, ethnicity or sexualorientation. The Group has identified a range of different programmes to achieve this. Acrossits brand portfolio the Group will seek to provide inclusive products, services and resourcesthat help more people to access the care and support they need. The Group will continue tofocus on educating consumers and empowering self-care, supporting health literacy andeducational programmes for individuals and healthcare professionals. Finally, the Group will 45SBTi is a collaboration between the United Nations, the World Resources Institute, the World Wide Fund for Nature and CDP, an environmental reporting charity. SBTi provides companies with accreditation of science-based climate targets. SBTi however,does not accept separate targets for business divisions within a wider company and therefore the Group will seek SBTiaccreditation post demerger from GSK. 80 utilise its reach, resources and expertise to cooperate with other experienced partners in the field of healthcare and inclusivity. One such example is its partnership with the EconomistIntelligence Unit and leading academics to create the Health Inclusivity Index which isexpected to launch in July 2022 to facilitate dialogue with and among key stakeholder groupsand to identify opportunities and actions. Within its own organisation, the Group is committed to inclusion, equality and diversity. This will include, but not be limited to, the setting of ambitious targets on female and ethnic minorityrepresentation in leadership roles. The Group has a robust operational governance structure and is committed to building strong corporate governance practices across its business. 3. Financial outlook and dividend policy The Directors believe that the Group offers a compelling growth outlook supporting attractive shareholder returns. Over the medium-term, the Directors expect the Group to deliver above-market annual organic revenue growth of 4 to 6 per cent., alongside sustainable moderatemargin expansion and strong cash generation and conversion. The Group's strong cash flowsupports its capital allocation priorities which are geared to investment in growth, a stronginvestment grade balance sheet and an initial dividend which is expected to be at the lowerend of a 30 to 50 per cent. pay-out ratio, subject to Board approval. Medium-term outlookThe Directors expect to deliver 4 to 6 per cent. annual organic revenue growth over the medium-term, ahead of expected medium-term annual growth in the Group's end markets ofapproximately 3 to 4 per cent. 46 The Group grew ahead of the market in both 2020 and 2021, delivering organic revenuegrowth of 2.8 per cent. in FY 2020 47and of 3.8 per cent. in FY 2021. The growth of both the Group's business and the overall consumer healthcare market was adversely impacted by theCOVID-19 pandemic over this period. The Directors expect the COVID-19 headwind to diminish from 2022 onwards and project annual market growth of 3 to 4 per cent. in the medium-term. The Directors expect the Groupto deliver an acceleration of its organic revenue growth to 4 to 6 per cent. annually over themedium-term with this above-market revenue growth driven by the Group's strategy andunderpinned by its scale, exceptional brand portfolio and well-developed capabilities. Sustainable moderate expansion in operating profit marginThe period FY 2019 to FY 2021 was characterised by a strong uplift in Adjusted operating profit margin from 19.5 per cent. in FY 2019 to 22.8 per cent. in FY 2021, driven by theintegration benefits from the combination with the Pfizer consumer healthcare business,coupled with operating leverage from revenue growth and efficient cost management in spite ofheadwinds from currency rate movements and divestments. Over the same period, the Groupreinvested over \u00a3200 million of cost savings in A&P to support accelerated revenue growth. Although the Directors expect the Group to incur incremental costs in order to operate as a standalone business (see Separation and standalone costs below), the Directors expect the 46Group's projection for medium term (3 - 5 year) market growth rates based on analysis of third party data. Projection is based on the Group's current brand / market footprint. 47Organic revenue in FY 2020 excludes revenue attributable to the brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 July 2020 (see paragraph 6.3 of Presentation of Financial and Other Information ), which made a significant contribution to the Group's revenue in the VMS and Pain Relief categories during the period, with the effect that the overallgrowth of the Group from 2019 to 2020 was reduced on an organic basis . 81 Group to deliver sustainable, moderate expansion in Adjusted operating profit margin over the medium-term, assuming constant exchange rates. This reflects the benefits of net price andproduct mix optimisation, efficiencies in the supply chain and continued cost discipline, offset inpart by reinvestment in innovation and A&P to drive growth. Separation and Admission costs, Restructuring costs and standalone operating costsThe Directors expect the Group to incur Separation and Admission costs of approximately \u00a30.4 billion between FY 2022 and FY 2024, most of which are expected to be incurred in FY2022. These include Admission costs of up to \u00a30.1 billion. In addition, the Directors expect theGroup to incur Restructuring costs of approximately \u00a30.2 billion between FY 2022 and FY 2024in connection with projects to support further efficiencies in its operations. The Directors do notcurrently anticipate any further significant restructuring programmes beyond this. BothRestructuring costs and Separation and Admission costs are treated as an Adjusting Item forthe purpose of calculating Adjusted operating profit. The Directors also expect the Group to incur recurring standalone operating costs of approximately \u00a3175-200 million per annum from 2022 onwards to provide the capabilities tooperate successfully as a standalone UK public listed company, including in technology andinfrastructure, and in corporate support functions. Strong cash conversionThe Group delivered \u00a33.8 billion free cash flow over the period 2019 to 2021 driven by a sharp focus on working capital discipline and stable capital investment of approximately 3 per cent. ofrevenue per annum. Over the medium-term, the Directors expect the Group to deliver strong free cash flow conversion, enabled by the Group's robust capital base with stable capex, a sharp focus onworking capital, and cost and cash discipline. Disciplined capital allocationThe Group will apply a disciplined approach to capital allocation. The Group's first capital allocation priority will be focused re-investment to drive sustainable revenue growth andattractive returns. Second, the Group will pursue a dividend policy which will reflect the long-term earnings and cash flow potential of the Group, consistent with maintaining sufficientfinancial flexibility and meeting the Group's capital allocation priorities (see Dividend Policy below). Third, the Group will pursue selective \"bolt-on\" acquisitions where the opportunities arecommercially compelling and consistent with the Group's strategy. The Group's capitalallocation priorities will be delivered in the context of maintaining an investment grade balancesheet with a target net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 3x by the end of 2024. Considerations for 2022The Directors expect the Group to achieve organic revenue growth in the range of 4 to 6 per cent. for FY 2022. The Adjusted operating profit margin in FY 2022 is expected to benefit from the following: \u0081 favourable volume mix benefits, reflecting continued strong growth and outperformance from its Power Brands; \u0081 the annualisation of pricing action taken in 2021 and further planned pricing;\u0081 further supply chain efficiencies; and\u0081 additional cost synergies resulting from the completed integration of the Pfizer consumer healthcare portfolio of approximately \u00a3600 million (\u00a3100 million higher thanpreviously announced) with approximately \u00a3120 million expected to be delivered in FY2022. 82 In addition, there are several factors which are expected to have a negative impact on the Adjusted operating profit margin in FY 2022: \u0081 the Group will continue to invest in its brands, maintaining its approach of investing in A&P ahead of revenue growth on a targeted basis; \u0081 inflationary cost pressures affecting the cost of commodity-related inputs, salaries and wages and other activities performed by the Group, although the Directors believe arange of possible mitigating actions are available to the Group; and \u0081 the 2022 margin will reflect a full year of the new annual costs associated with running the Company as a standalone public company of \u00a3175-200 million. These revenue and margin expectations for FY 2022 assume no major unforeseen macroeconomic or geopolitical developments arise after the publication of this Prospectus. Dividend policyFollowing the Demerger, the Company will adopt a dividend policy, which will reflect the long- term earnings and cash flow potential of the Group, consistent with maintaining sufficientfinancial flexibility and meeting the Group's capital allocation priorities. The initial dividend isexpected to be at the lower end of a 30 to 50 per cent. pay-out ratio, subject to Board approval.The Company expects to pay a dividend to Shareholders in relation to the second half of 2022in H1 2023, subject to Board approval and following approval of the Company's FY 2022results. 4. Categories and brands The Group operates across five categories. These are (i) Oral Health; (ii) VMS; (iii) Pain Relief; (iv) Respiratory Health; and (v) Digestive Health and Other. FY 2021 Revenue Split by Product Category Respiratory the global market leader in OTC/VMS (which includes Pain Relief, Respiratory Health, Digestive Health and VMS), as well as the third ranked player in Oral Health. 83 The Group has a portfolio of established consumer brands with strong brand equities at a national, regional and global level. Following a progressive rationalisation and focusing of theGroup's portfolio, 58 per cent. of the Group's 2021 revenue was accounted that drive the greatest growth for the Group withmarket-leading positions, an attractive geographic footprint and long-term growth potential. The world's leading Sensitivity Toothpaste (and no.2overall Toothpaste). The world's leading Denture Care brand.

The leading Systemic Pain Relief brand outside the US. Europe's no. 2 Systemic Cold and Flu brand.North America's no. 3 Systemic Cold and Flu brand. The world's leading Nasal Decongestant brand. The world's leading Multivitamin. Additionally, the Group has a range of local strategic brands which have scale and leadership positions in key markets and contribute significantly to the Group's business, particularly in theUSA and China. The Group's leading brands are detailed by category below. 4.1 Oral Health The Group has one of the world's leading Oral Health businesses, with operations in over 120 markets and a nearly 100-year track record in successful innovation and manufacture of qualityOral Health products. The Group specialises in Therapeutic Oral Health, where it is the globalmarket leader , 49providing therapeutic solutions to consumers for the prevention and treatment of specific oral health conditions including sensitivity, acid erosion, gum disease, denture care 48parodontax is among the world's fastest growing global Toothpas te brands based on Group analysis Euromonitor Passport data (2021). 49Source: Group analysis of third party data from (Nielsen, IRI, Intage, IQVIA Consumption Sales Data (2021-2022). Therapeutic Oral Health is defined as Therapeutic Toothpaste and Total Dental Appliance Care. 84 and dry mouth. This focus both allows the Group to leverage its leading capabilities in scientific research, expert engagement and human understanding and allows it to focus on some of thefastest growing premium oral health segments. This approach has enabled the Group tocommand a price premium over the market and grow ahead of the global Toothpaste marketevery year since 2015. 50 The Group operates in a highly competitive Oral Health market, estimated to be worth\u00a325 billion worldwide. The Group focuses primarily on Toothpaste and Denture Care, althoughit also has a significant presence in the Mouthwash and Manual Toothbrush markets (includingits leading Manual Toothbrush brand in Germany, Dr.BEST). In Toothpaste, the Group is one of a small number of global players and it is ranked second in the market worldwide. In DentureCare it is the market leader. In FY 2021, the Group generated revenue of \u00a32.724 billion across its Oral Health portfolio.SensodyneSensodyne is the number two Toothpaste brand globally and the number one dentist- recommended Toothpaste worldwide for sensitivity. Its purpose is to \"help humanity reclaimlife's small pleasures without the restrictions of sensitive teeth\" and, since its launch in 1961, ithas become the brand most associated by consumers with the care of sensitive teeth acrossvirtually all of its key markets. Tooth sensitivity is a common condition with nearly one third of the global population experiencing symptoms, nevertheless only one third of sufferers purchase a sensitivitytoothpaste, thereby offering the opportunity for significant penetration-led growth. 51The combination of growing consumer awareness, recommendations of sensitivity toothpastes bydental experts, favourable demographics and rising incomes in higher-growth economies,provides an opportunity for the Group to leverage Sensodyne's brand recognition andinnovation capability. Building on its long history of innovation and pioneering science, Sensodyne has moved beyond a primary focus on sensitivity-related conditions to encompass other oral healthconditions. These include innovative products developed in response to a range of identifiedconsumer needs, such as speed of relief and whitening. For the former, the Group firstlaunched Sensodyne Rapid Relief in 2010 offering fast pain relief from sensitivity within 60seconds. An improved, clinically proven formulation providing rapid relief combined with theadditional benefit of long-lasting protection was launched in 2017. For the latter, the Group haslaunched tailored whitening variants of Sensodyne Repair and Protect, a product that canrepair sensitive areas of teeth to relieve dentine hypersensitivity. These have increasedpenetration with sensitivity sufferers who also want the benefit of whitening. The Group continues to enhance Sensodyne's product mix, (which also includes mouthwashes and toothbrushes) and increase value through premiumisation. Most recently, SensodyneNourish was launched, which is formulated with a bio-active mineral to nourish and strengthenteeth, and is blended with natural mint and essential oils. The range is vegan-friendly with arecycle-ready tube, cap and carton. The brand has continued to outperform the global toothpaste market, reflecting underlying brand strength, successful innovation and strong consumer uptake in traditional retail ande-commerce channels. 50Growth rates for both Toothpaste market size and the Group performance calculated in Retail Value RSP, GBP Million, fixed 2021 exchange rates. 51Source: Oral Health Population Data - IPSOS Incidence Study Calculations 2015. 85 Polident The Group is the global market leader in Denture Care (fixatives and cleansers) with leadership positions in eight of the top ten Denture Care markets. Its denture care products aresold under three major brands - Polident, Corega and Poligrip (\" Poli/Corega \") - across approximately 60 countries. Poli/Corega is the leading Denture Care brand family, operating inboth cleansers and fixatives at a global scale, and is highly recommended by dentists. The Group has a deep human understanding of the profound impact and burden that wearing a denture can have on people's lives. Poli/Corega's purpose is to lighten the load for all dentalappliance wearers, providing solutions that give people the confidence to live life withoutworrying about their dentures or appliance, granting them the security to eat, speak, kiss andsmile freely. Polident denture cleansers have a low-abrasive formula and help keep denturesclean and fresh, killing 99.99 per cent. of odour-causing bacteria in lab tests. Polident denturefixatives provide strong hold, food seal and comfort. The Poli/Corega range includes productsfor denture wearers who wear either full or partial dentures, as well as for people withappliances including mouthguards and retainers. The Group continues to innovate and develop new product offerings under the Poli/Corega brand family. In the USA, Poligrip Max Seal was developed as a fixative with a precision nozzleto help block out food particles. Poligrip Cushion and Comfort utilises Adaptagrip technologyand forms a unique gel layer which acts as a cushion to help provide gum comfort. PolidentProGuard and Retainer has been launched in the USA as a fast and easy-to-use cleanser inboth tablet and foam form, and is compatible with materials often used for removable dentalappliances. parodontax familyparodontax is among the world's fastest growing global Toothpaste brands 52and the largest gum health brand (outside of China). parodontax is dedicated to winning the fight against thedevastating progression of gum disease and, alongside its sister brands, Corsodyl andChlorhexamed (together, the \" parodontax family \"), it offers a range of specialist gum care products, which are designed for people looking to keep their gums healthy. While the Grouphas successfully built a sizeable presence in certain markets, including the USA, theparodontax family is yet to be introduced in many others which offer the potential forgeographic expansion.

The region is distinguished bya rapidly emerging middle class fuelling a demand for increased self-care and productpremiumisation, together with high levels of e-commerce in key markets, most notably China. Asia Pacific region 69Source: Group analysis based on external data (Nielsen). 70Source: World Bank (2020). 97 APAC markets delivered \u00a32.1 billion of revenue in FY 2021, representing 22 per cent. of the Group's revenue. Approximately 5,900 people71work in the APAC region and the Group's R&D centre in Suzhou, China develops new products for the region based on local needs andinsights and collaborates with the six regional manufacturing sites to facilitate their introduction. The Group is the market leader in the APAC region in OTC/VMS, with leading positions in Pain Relief (ranked first) and VMS (ranked second). In Oral Health, the Group holds the leadershipposition in Denture Care and Sensitivity Toothpaste (among the top five in Toothpaste overall).This has been achieved through a highly focused portfolio in which nine brands 72with market leadership positions accounted for 84 per cent. of total APAC revenue in FY 2021. Overall Australia IndiaChina Japan Taiwan7473 The Group's business in APAC is supported by broad local capabilities and expertise which provide it with the agility to respond to evolving consumer needs across the dynamic marketsof the region. In addition to local commercial execution, the region's employees also supportR&D, marketing strategy and manufacturing. The Group's R&D centre in Suzhou, Chinadevelops new products for the region based on local needs and insights and collaborates withthe six regional manufacturing sites to facilitate their introduction. Through a strong regionalsupply network, approximately 80 per cent. of the Group's business in APAC is supplied withinthe APAC region. In recognition of the diverse retailer and regulatory market landscape within APAC, the Group takes a varied approach to its distribution strategy across the region, which variously consistsof direct sales to retailers, indirect sales made through distributors, or a combination of bothmethods depending on the channel dynamic of the given market and the scale of the Group'soperations. In India, the Group's products are distributed by Hindustan Unilever Ltd. The sales force within APAC is also deployed according to the structure of the relevant market. Centralised buying functions are managed by centralised account management in more 71Full-time equivalent employees and agency staff as at 31 March 2022 (rounded to the nearest 100). 72Sensodyne (#1 sensitive Toothpaste brand in Analgesicin APAC and leading pain brand outside traditional Chinese medicine (\" TCM \")), ENO (#1 number one Digestive Health brand in India), Fenbid (#2 Systemic Pain Relief brand in China and leading Pain Relief brand outside of TCM), Bactroban (#1 woundhealer in APAC). 73Source: Group analysis based on third party data from Nielsen, IRI, Intage, IQVIA Consumption Sales Data (2021-2022). 74Sensodyne is ranked 1st in toothpaste in Japan by Euromonitor in 2021 but the difference with the 2nd ranked player is within the margin of error. 98 developed markets, whereas smaller, independent customers are managed by territory managers and sales representatives. The Group's sales force in APAC consists ofapproximately 2,500 employees who are further supported by distributor sales representativesin certain markets. These teams are supported by the Group's shopper science lab inSingapore, which enables category management partnerships with key retail partners. The APAC region leads the world in digital commerce with 61 per cent. of global retail e-commerce sales in 2020 (according to eMarketer, May 2021). The Group has investedheavily in this area. Through the prioritisation of digital programmes in APAC, e-commercerevenue grew by 36.3 per cent. in FY 2021. One such programme in China is based on the latest developments in the online-to-offline (\"O2O \") services market. O2O services enable a seamless digital purchase experience for the consumer by combining physical retail pharmacy locations for sourcing and platform courierteams for collection and delivery. These services enable consumers to find product informationand order medicines through O2O platforms and receive at home or to office delivery, typicallywithin 30 minutes. The Group identified the potential for O2O services and established adedicated O2O team to establish strategic collaborations with leading O2O platforms such asMeituan and Eleme (part of the Alibaba group). The Group has established flagship e-commerce brand-specific stores run on Alibaba's T-mall platforms and collaborates with online health and consultation platforms such as We-Doctorand JD Health to enable consumer access to online advice, educational content, brand contentand on some platforms also direct product purchase. The Group has also developed strategic collaborations with the Alibaba group where its Digital Captaincy status in the VMS category enables access to a greater degree of data granularitybetter informing its planning and commercial execution capability. Besides its strong position on established e-commerce platforms such as T-mall, the Group is also actively expanding into social commerce 75on popular social engagement platforms such as Douyin. The Group has recently established stores for several of its brands on Douyin'splatform so that consumers can immediately purchase products on the platform whilstengaging with the brand through content and livestreaming. The Group has also established an in-house audience management platform that collates data to provide a single source of information on consumers and healthcare professionals in orderto deliver personalised experiences. This enables richer and better targeted consumerengagement to meet consumers' healthcare needs more effectively through CRM andmarketing programmes. 6. Engagement with Consumers As a leading consumer healthcare business, the Group has broad capabilities in marketing, expert marketing, design, and consumer and business insights and analytics. Thesecapabilities are complemented by a strong and growing capability in digital commerce. 75Selling products via e-commerce through social media . 99 Marketing The Group has a clear and differentiated purpose to deliver better everyday health with humanity and this drives the way the Group develops and commercialises its products. TheDirectors believe the Group has a competitive advantage in everyday health with its humanunderstanding, combined with its trusted science. The Group's brands are purposeful, foundedin science and focused, not only on care, but on quality of life, empathy and inclusion. Restoring the joy of movement Helping humanity reclaim life's small pleasures Lightening the load for all appliance wearersReleasing the wonders of breathing well Championing confidence from the gums upFreedom from pain so the human spirit can shineFighting for a flu-safe world Building every body from the inside outReclaim life's possibilities By putting brand purpose at the centre of highly integrated campaigns, which are aligned across commercial, expert, marketing and R&D, the Group's human-centric brands help todeliver more emotional connections and relatable consumer-centric experiences to supportbetter health outcomes. For example, Voltaren's purpose is to restore the joy of movement for body pain sufferers worldwide: A number of the Group's campaigns are enduringly famous, reflected in and recognised by thewide range of global and national marketing awards the Group has received. Sensodyne'sfamous dentist testimonial advertising was launched in 2005 and continues to offer authenticdentist recommendation to consumers across the world. Over 5,000 dentists have offered torecommend Sensodyne in the media, reflecting the significant numbers who do so every day. 100 Newer campaigns have also received considerable acclaim. For example, Theraflu's \"roll up your sleeves\" campaign and #FightingFluTogether to better meet the needs of underservedcommunities drove reappraisal of the brand and improved social sentiment scores for Theraflu. The Group prioritises marketing with a positive social or environmental impact and incorporatessocial and sustainability goals aligned with brand purpose within its marketing strategies. Forexample, Otrivin's brand purpose is to \"release the wonders of breathing well\". Accordingly,Otrivin aims to raise awareness of the impact of air pollution on health reflecting growingconsumer concerns. In 2021, Otrivin partnered with a European biotech company to build aplayground that actively purifies the air as more children play in it. This is particularly pertinentgiven that 93 per cent. of the world's children play in spaces with unacceptable levels of airquality. This installation featured at COP26 and drove significant levels of earned media. Historically, the Group has achieved multiple successes for its marketing campaigns, including design, creative impact, effectiveness and digital. This includes high-profile Gold and GrandPrix awards at Cannes Lions, the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, the Effies, Red Dotand D&AD. The Group continues to evolve its marketing operations and in 2021 it opened its pioneering in-house content studio, CaST. CaST provides end-to-end content production, allowing theGroup to be agile and cost-effective in its content development, delivered via in-house subjectmatter experts and underpinned by technology. This production model also helps the Group toadvance its creative effectiveness through dynamic creative optimisation (\" DCO \"). Since 2021, CaST has delivered nearly 30 DCO campaigns across 13 markets, with 90 per cent. of thesedelivering performance improvements against benchmarks (e.g. cost per click, cost percompleted view and 'viewability'). The marketing function also continues to embracetechnology, such as artificial intelligence (\" AI\") and in 2020, Sensodyne launched Trio, the world's first machine learning and AI-enabled mobile experience which assesses people's riskof having tooth sensitivity. Trio is designed to give users personalised treatment advice and asample product or coupon, based on a picture of a user's mouth and a short questionnairefilled out by the user. Trio has been launched as a pilot across multiple markets, includingsome of Sensodyne's fastest growth markets, such as China and India. Additionally, the Grouputilises an industry-leading AI tool designed in partnership with Google and Picasso Labs -Creative X - which scans over 20,000 video assets in 56 markets and providesrecommendations for creative improvements following YouTube best practices. Commercial insights and analyticsAchieving a deep understanding of consumers, shoppers, experts and retailers is pivotal to the mission of the Group. The Group benefits from investments in in-house research facilities to solicit live shopper feedback. This is used to improve pack designs, point of sale materials and shelf layouts,including research tools to reach shoppers in their own homes, which the Group utilisedextensively during the COVID-19 pandemic. 101 In addition, the Group's shopper science labs provide real-life and digital store environments across all retail channels to recreate shopping scenarios to understand shopping behaviour, sothat it can tailor and personalise category and brand execution. This is supported by its centreof excellence for shopper psychology, shopping insights and category management. The Group uses its observatory tool to provide marketers, R&D and other teams across the organisation with direct access to the full breadth and depth of its knowledge base and tosupport their collaboration. This tool encompasses over 8,000 insight and analytics projects,nearly 1,000 tested concepts, over 20 specialist subject libraries, and links to over 30 otherdashboards and research sources. It is updated in real time and new insights are added nearlyevery day. Consumer insight and understanding are further built through a number of complementary marketing initiatives. For example, by partnering externally with InSites Consulting, the Grouphas developed an extensive toolset to provide enhanced consumer insight. This has beensupported by more traditional large-scale key audience survey data and qualitative interviewinformation. By enabling on-demand engagement with almost \"any audience anywhere\" via established external partnerships to provide insight globally, the marketing organisation has flexibility toidentify and utilise the optimal market research approaches to identify commercialopportunities, while taking into consideration commercial objectives, target audiences andtiming requirements. The Group uses an extensive toolset to spot emerging consumer trends with disruptive potential in order to help it shape the future of everyday health. Its toolset is designed todiscover and frame trends impacting health and wellness, to monitor their expression over timeand to prioritise those that will rise and endure. The Group's proprietary and comprehensiveglobal trends framework monitors forces of change, trend territories and over 20 trends whichhave the highest adoption and disruption potential. Combined with tools to monitor fresh trendsignals from search, social and in-market competitor activity, this enables the Group to identifyand react to global and local innovation opportunities, thereby driving incremental sales. Digital capabilityDeep human understanding attained through the Group's data partnerships and insights process is enhanced by digital capability. The Group was an early adopter of the Tech Stack(Google), creating direct ownership of and access to audience data. Additionally, the Groupuses Publicis' PeopleCloud (cloud-based marketing platform) to leverage relevant data sets tobetter identify and connect with its growth audiences. The Group has systematically applied adata-driven approach to marketing via PeopleCloud across its markets, which enables it totarget similar customers and continuously learn and grow its customer base. By responsiblybalancing privacy and personalisation, the Group is able to build long-term relevantrelationships with consumers across all of its brands. Marketing campaigns are planned via digital-first connection planning, generating and placing content made relevant for events, seasons, formats, cultural occasions and even weatherpatterns. One of the Group's advancements in predictive marketing is a proprietary tool calledTRGR, or Trigger. This pulls in data signals that help pinpoint where and when the Group'saudiences are more or less receptive to its messages. It employs a set of bespoke andcustomised business rules to provide dynamically personalised content designed to drive theGroup's visibility in key moments, while delivering improved cost efficiency and strongerperformance. Digital media spend has reached approximately 50 per cent. of media spend,fuelled by robust return on investment metrics from marketing effectiveness tools. More broadly, the Group has increased its investment in digital capability across the business to improve overall speed and efficiency. Data, a key enabler for growth, is a particular area offocus as it allows the Group to better understand its consumers and customers. In 2020, adedicated data team of data scientists, innovation specialists, user experience designers and 102 data apprentices was set up to build the data strategy and governance processes in readiness for a future standalone business. The team is also focused on building data literacy across thebusiness to enable it to extract the most value from its data, which will accelerate the Group'sdigital transformation and support more effective decision making. As part of the recent transformation of the business, the Group places significant focus on enhancing the digital capability and literacy of all of its people. In 2020, it launched the DigitalCommerce Academy, an online learning platform with training modules, playbooks, planningframeworks and other resources to help embed core digital commerce learnings andbehaviours. Since launch in August 2020, more than 5,600 employees across over 84countries have completed training through the platform as of March 2022. The academycomplements the digital accelerator programme, which rolled out in 2020 in the EMEA region,following a successful launch in APAC in 2019. The programme is designed to drive salesthrough digital commerce and promote a digital-first culture by integrating external digitalexperts within teams. Building on this, in 2021, the Group announced a partnership withUniversity College London to create an industry first, exclusive digital commerce mini-MBA,which is available for all of the Group's employees. As a university-level educationalcertification, the programme represents a first for the consumer industry. The acceleration of investments into digital infrastructure and media channels has created a more efficient, transparent and connected path to consumers. The Group has re-balanced itsdigital investment to reflect consumer changes, while the increased use of digital channels hasalso enabled it to analyse data to a greater degree, delivering key consumer insights andenabling the targeting of specific audiences and consumer needs that previously may not havebeen addressed. The Group has begun to see significant success where it has made investments in digital. In the 2020 launch of Voltaren in the USA, e-commerce formed a key pillar of the successfulbrand launch. Two billion media impressions were earned through traditional TV and onlinevideo advertisements. Similarly, during the Advil Dual Action launch, 588 million YouTubeimpressions were made. Notably, the Group's first US website for Voltaren, VoltarenGel.com, was recognised by the Arthritis Foundation as the world's first arthritis-friendly website and obtained Gold Distinctionin the 13 thAnnual Shorty Awards. Among other features, the website implemented accessibility features such as voice search and scalable font sizes to account for the possibility that usersmight have arthritis in their hands that would make it difficult to navigate a website. Overall, the Group's e-commerce revenue grew from 4 per cent. of overall revenue in 2019 to 8 per cent. in 2021 and the Group expects e-commerce growth to continue. 7. Engagement with Experts OverviewThe ability to engage appropriately with experts within the healthcare community is a key driver of the Group's performance. The Group's capabilities in expert engagement are one of its keystrengths and it is widely recognised as a partner of choice by healthcare professionals. There are approximately 10 million healthcare professionals globally addressing the conditions the Group serves and collectively they have the capacity to make an astonishing 52 billionrecommendations every year. Importantly, consumers take these expert recommendationsseriously and often act upon them. For example, 85 per cent. of pharmacist recommendationslead to a purchase. The Group has a dedicated approach to building relationships with experts, healthcare professionals and external leaders based on trusted advice, recommendations and trial of itsproducts. This is supported by its purpose to \"deliver better everyday health with humanity\" and 103 is sustained by the knowledge that expert engagement has a direct impact on everyday health behaviours. The Group is differentiated by its commitment to trusted science and strict policieson scientific engagement, both of which provide a strong foundation for its engagement withthe healthcare community. Nurturing genuine relationships with the scientific and healthcare community also generates significant benefits for the Group which go beyond the direct generation of sales through expertrecommendations. Expert engagement generates insights that inform product design andsupport clear communication of product benefits to consumer populations. It also helps toensure that the Group has early visibility on unmet category needs. Expert field forceThe Group maintains a large, dedicated consumer healthcare expert field force that engages with doctors, dentists, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals across all of its keymarkets and has a reputation that scores positively in terms of service. The Group's researchindicates that the field force's \"called-on\" experts make more recommendations per week thanexperts that are not called on and this has a direct impact on product performance. DigitalIn addition to its expert field force, the Group engages with a broad group of healthcare professionals through its digital tools. The Group has dedicated digital channels for experts in38 markets and has a specialist digital team that engages with experts and healthcareprofessionals via a dedicated portal, webinars, personalised learning, email marketing, socialmedia, searches and paid media channels. Conferences and eventsThe Directors believe that one of the most effective ways of ensuring that consumers and patients feel heard and reassured is by respecting, valuing and supporting the experts thatcare for them. As a result, it runs a number of above brand and audience-led initiatives thatsupport the wellbeing, professional development and, where appropriate, business acumen ofexpert audiences. In addition, the Group has a presence at all major healthcare professional conferences, which are growing in reach with the addition of virtual capabilities. The Group also presentssymposiums on topics relevant to its products and categories and publishes in peer-reviewedpublications globally. Partnerships and initiativesThe Group also engages with experts across a range of global and regional initiatives which are relevant to its brands and categories. These allow the Group to build trust with thehealthcare community and they also provide useful insights to support future innovation andincrease engagement for the Group and its products. The Group recently partnered with the International Federation of Pharmacists (\" FIP\") to commission research amongst their four million professional members on the impact of airpollution on respiratory health. FIP is the global federation of national associations ofpharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists and it has 146 member organisations worldwide.The partnership has resulted in pioneering research on the impact of air pollution on respiratoryhealth and a thorough understanding of the barriers that exist to optimal self-care, includinghealth literacy. In a similar way, the Group's partnership with world-leading scientific experts and Smile Train, a non-profit organisation providing corrective surgery for children with cleft lips and palates, ledto the first comprehensive cleft care guidelines that helped provide the evidence for theinclusion of orofacial clefts as a priority issue in the WHO resolution and resulting Global OralHealth Strategy. 104 8. R&D The Group's dedicated consumer healthcare R&D organisation has a track record of successful innovation and the generation of product claims supported by scientifically robustclinical evidence. It also has a critical role in supporting the compliance of the Group's existingand new products with varied, complex and moving regulatory requirements in over 170markets in which the Group operates. It is differentiated by its global reach, broad capabilities,its leading position in Rx-to-OTC switches and its ability to combine cutting edge science withdeep consumer understanding . CapabilitiesThe Group's R&D organisation's multidisciplinary talent pool of approximately 1,400 highly skilled scientists combines OTC and FMCG experience and represents a wide range ofscientific disciplines including scientists, medics, dentists, nutritionists, formulators, engineers,regulatory professionals and flavour scientists. The Group's category-level marketing and R&Dteams lead the strategic agenda of the Power Brands and drive and execute at scale theGroup's innovation pipeline. Local marketing and R&D teams drive the growth and innovationagenda of the local strategic brands and execute local market-relevant innovations for thePower Brands. This organisational setup maximises speed of implementation and tailors forconsumer specificities. See also paragraphs 5 and 9 of this Part III ( Business Overview ). The Group has three state-of-the-art R&D cen tres in Richmond, Virginia, USA (OTC/VMS), Weybridge, UK (Oral Health), and Suzhou, China (all categories in the Chinese market) providingit with a broad range of in-house scientific capab ilities. Among other capabilities, these sites possess: (i) fast prototyping and pilot scale equipment for early stage development; (ii) imagingcapability with high specification instrumentati on; and (iii) analytical chemistry, product chemistry, sensory, packaging, process engineering, microbiology and stability capabilities. The R&D centres also support scale-up and technical transfers to manufacturing and provide end-to-endsupport for small-scale manufacturing. These c apabilities are augmented by further consumer- centric capabilities, including consumer behavioural facilities and sensory and flavour sciencelaboratories. In addition, the Group has embedded innovation resources which support local business units and enable the Group to recruit R&D talent globally to develop products closer toits consumers and tailor innovation for local consumer needs. The Directors believe that the ability to support its products and claims with trusted science is critical to its relationship with consumers and healthcare professionals. In support of this, theGroup has dedicated capabilities to support both clinical trials and real world studies of itsproducts and innovations. The Group has conducted over 65 clinical studies involving over6,000 participants over the last five years, whilst the successful Rx-to-OTC switch of Voltarenin the USA in 2020 was supported using data in markets where Voltaren is already an OTCmedicine. The R&D function's expertise is also reflected in its track record of publications,peer-reviewed journal contributions and patents, including 296 publications and over 70 prioritypatent applications filed within the five years to end of 2021. The Group's R&D organisation places the understanding of the consumer at the heart of its innovation processes and draws on its dedicated in-house sensory and flavour science labsand consumer and shopper facilities to design products with the consumer in mind. TheGroup's R&D scientists regularly connect with consumers via digital channels to obtain earlyfeedback on innovation and the Group also monitors e-commerce reviews and utilises data-driven tools to better understand trends, unmet needs and areas of opportunity. Advancedvisualisation techniques enable the Group to translate scientific benefits to consumers in anaccessible manner. The Group also maintains world class regulatory and medical teams who are embedded across multiple markets in each region. This enables the Group to rapidly launch innovations,maintain compliance on existing products, and engage in and enhance the self-care regulatorylandscape - a capability which is a barrier for other smaller players. To illustrate this point, theGroup has completed over 19,000 regulatory applications and approvals around the world inthe last three years. 105 The Group augments its internal capabilities through dedicated business development and external innovation teams that scout and in-license leading technologies. Innovation is furthersupported by a large external ecosystem including established suppliers and contractmanufacturing organisations. Over 30 per cent. of the Group's pipeline originates from externalpartnerships. Rx-to-OTC switchesThe Group has an enduring and world-leading capability in Rx-to-OTC switches. The switch of prescription products to OTC status is a key source of innovation and growth in OTC andrequires expertise in medical, regulatory and commercial matters. The Group has adifferentiated switch and direct-to-OTC consumer capability with a proven track record, havingsuccessfully completed four switches (Nexium, Flonase, Sensimist and Voltaren) in the USA inthe last eight years, more than twice as many as any other business. The Group's capabilitiesin switches are long-standing, with the Group and its predecessors having switched 19products since 1990. Additionally, the Group successfully completed one new drug applicationin 2020 (Advil Dual Action). These capabilities are a key differentiator and the Group has along-standing dedicated in-house team composed of R&D and commercial experts, with atrack record of switching both GSK and non-GSK products. Going forward, the Directors expect new switch opportunities to be increasingly supported by digital technology to increase product awareness and availability, to enable better self-care andto deepen direct relationships with consumers. Selected innovationsThe Contac product range includes a tablet that gives effective relief of seven cold and flu symptoms. In China, to address the Ministry of Health's policy restricting pseudoephedrine-containing OTC medicines, the Group was able to in-license appropriate technology and useits scientific and market expertise to overcome significant regulatory and technical challengesto launch the Contac Revive innovation in August 2021. In 2021, the Group upgraded its core Sensodyne Repair & Protect franchise with the launch of Sensodyne Repair & Protect Deep Repair. The Group leveraged a previously acquired noveltechnology, NovaMin, which was based on findings from bone implant technology. Thisenables a deep and targeted occlusion of dentine tubules, in turn helping to reduce dentinehypersensitivity. A further recent innovation in Oral Health is the launch of Sensodyne Complete Protection in January 2022, where the Group has created a formulation which offers all-round oral carebenefits, such as cavity protection and enamel strengthening, while still providing Sensodyne'sclinically proven sensitivity protection. In February 2021, the Group launched its Centrum Probiotics range in China. The R&D function developed the products using certified probiotic strains imported from Denmark. Thelaunch was the Group's first major move to expand Centrum beyond being a purely multi-vitamin and minerals brand, and was achieved within seven months from project initiation,reflecting the Group's agile R&D capabilities. In 2020, the FDA approved Advil Dual Action with acetaminophen as an OTC product for pain relief. The exclusive formula, launched in September 2020, is the first FDA-approved OTCcombination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the USA. Across 2019 and 2020, the Group upgraded its Voltaren franchise across Europe with the introduction of two award-winning packaging solutions (with the one launched in 2019 alreadypatented, and a patent application pending for the one launched in 2020). Detailed consumerwork highlighted that convenience and ease of opening were key trial barriers. A \"no mess\"applicator removed the need for direct product contact with hands. Additionally, observing thetarget arthritis group's use of the original product led to the introduction of the arthritis friendly\"easy open\" cap. 106 As part of its wider sustainability strategy, the Group has committed to developing solutions for all of its packaging to be fully recyclable or reusable by 2030 (where quality, safety andregulations permit). Within Oral Health, extensive stability and quality testing is underway toensure that all of the one-billion-plus toothpaste tubes produced by the Group each year aremade recyclable (first wave launched in July 2021 for Sensodyne Pronamel in Europe). TheGroup is also redesigning its toothpaste caps with ergonomic upgrades to reduce plastic useby more than 10 per cent. The Dr.BEST bamboo toothbrush (launched in 2020) and the Dr.BEST first climate-neutral toothbrush made from renewable resources (launched in 2021) are further recent innovations highlighting the Group's sustainability strategy. For further information on the Group's R&D-driven innovations, see paragraph 4 of this Part III (Business Overview ) above. 9. Quality and supply chain OverviewThe Group operates a supply chain which combines a network of 24 in-house dedicated consumer healthcare manufacturing sites with a number of third-party contract manufacturingorganisations (\" CMOs \"). The Group derives important commercial and competitive benefits from the large historical investments it has made in it s footprint, infrastructure, quality control systems and people. It benefits both from the economies of scale from its large multi-region manufacturingsites and from its ability to manufacture with agility and scale on a regional level, close to itsconsumers. In addition, the quality and supply chain organisation's track record in consistentlymeeting the rigorous compliance requirements o f national regulatory bodies, demonstrated via successful quality inspection outcomes, is the result of investment, expertise and a culturalcommitment to quality which are difficult to replicate. See paragraph 2.7 of Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) for a discussion of the key factors impacting the Group's supply chain. Group Internal Supply Network76 Scale manufacturing at a local level As one of the largest consumer healthcare companies in the world, the Group is able to deliver the cost benefits of scale manufacturing both at multi-region supply sites such as Dungarvanand Nyon, and through regionally focused sites close to its customers such as Suzhou andOak Hill. 76The manufacturing sites in Argentina and Brazil will be transferred to the Group following Separation. See paragraph 15.4 of Part XII ( Additional Information ) for further information. 107 Every year, the Group supplies more than 3.5 billion consumer packs globally, including approximately 1.7 billion tubes of toothpaste, approximately 55 billion individual tablets andhigh volumes of liquid doses, gels and creams. Approximately 70 per cent. of consumer packsare sourced internally within the Group, with the remainder through a network of CMOs. The Group's ability to manufacture locally at scale is illustrated by some of the Group's key sites: Levice, Slovakia Supply of the Group's full portfolio of toothpaste at competitive cost across EMEA at a volume in excess of 600 million tubes annually. Dungarvan, Ireland Supply of up to six billion tablets of Panadol annually in addition to the full range of denture cleansers and fixatives. Nyon, Switzerland Supply of more than 200 million units of the Power Brands Voltaren and Otrivin. Guayama, Puerto RicoSupply of all Advil, Centrum and Emergen-C products for North America. The production of Emergen-C was conso lidated into Guayama as part of the Group's ongoing supply chain efficiency programme followingcompletion of the Pfizer Transaction to add further scale leverage. Suzhou, China Dedicated China supply site combining agility for new product introduction and manufacture at scale for key local products. Therecent addition of a second facility was designed to support growthand expansion of the VMS product range. The Group's manufacturing footprint is well aligned geographically with its key markets around the world. This allows products to be regionally sourced and more easily tailored to local needswhilst also reducing the costs and risks associated with single-sourced global manufacturing.For example, the six in-region manufacturing sites in APAC supply 82 per cent. of the region'sproducts and work closely together with the Suzhou R&D organisation to facilitate the rapidintroduction of innovative region-specific products. The geographically aligned sourcing ofproducts also provides a natural currency hedge, helping to mitigate the impact of foreignexchange movements. Complementary mix of internal and external supplyThe Group's supply chain includes approximately 180 external CMOs which supply approximately 30 per cent. of its consumer packs. While the Group has consolidated its CMOnetwork in recent years as part of its ongoing supply chain efficiency programme, it has manyongoing long-established relationships with high quality and trusted CMOs. These relationshipsallow the Group to access specialist dose forms, for example, in sprays and patches, whilesupporting the Group's agility in meeting changing consumer demands and providinginnovation and responsive new product introduction in all geographies. Fully invested systems infrastructureIn support of the internal and external network of manufacturing sites, the Group maintains a robust and up-to-date systems infrastructure including a single SAP enterprise resourceplanning system at 22 of its 24 internal sites, separate from that of the GSK Group andcovering demand forecasting, supply planning, new product introduction and artworkmanagement. These investments enable seamless interaction across the supply chain whetherproduction is sourced internally or externally from CMOs. 108 Ongoing synergy delivery from the integration of the Novartis and Pfizer consumer healthcare businesses The Group continues to benefit from the scale advantages arising from the combination of both the Novartis and Pfizer consumer healthcare businesses with GSK's consumer healthcarebusiness. Over the past six years, the network rationalisation programme has reduced theGroup's internal network from 41 sites inherited from the legacy GSK Group, Novartis andPfizer businesses to 24 and the Group's supply network continues to deliver significantsynergies from the integration of the six legacy Pfizer sites and CMO network. In FY 2021 over\u00a390m cost of sales synergies were delivered with additional synergies projected in 2022. Robust quality and complianceThe Group's supply chain infrastructure is distinguished by high quality standards and rigorous compliance procedures which are applied both to internal sites and the Group's CMO partners.These allow consumers, healthcare professionals and regulators to be confident in the Group'sproducts. The effectiveness of the Group's quality management systems is validated by ongoing strong performance in external regulator audits. The Group's supply chain is subject to multipleregulatory inspections every year by national medical regulatory bodies including the FDA andMHRA. Since 2019, there have been more than 200 inspections by national regulatory bodieswith a 99.5 per cent. success rate across the internal supply network. The Group has continued to invest to sustain this strong quality and compliance record in order to keep ahead of evolving regulatory requirements. Recent investments include an updatedquality management system, enabling enhanced end-to-end compliance capability andefficiency and electronic batch records deployment into key internal manufacturing sites. Efficient and customer-oriented warehousing and logistics networkFollowing the integration of both the Pfizer and Novartis consumer healthcare businesses, the Group's warehousing and logistics network has been reviewed and optimised to meetefficiency and customer service requirements for the combined portfolio and channel mix. In markets with well-developed infrastructure and established third-party OTC distribution capabilities, for example in North America and Western Europe, the Group operates throughlarge-scale distribution centres. In Europe, to further leverage scale and to enable efficientinventory and service management, the Group operates warehouses covering multiplemarkets, often in conjunction with multi-language packs. Typically, distribution centres areoperated with expert third parties in order to leverage scale, expertise and technologyplatforms. In all cases, distribution centres, whether in house or third-party, must comply withthe Group's rigorous quality compliance standards and are subject to the Group's auditprocess. Ensuring supply continuityThe Group benefits from a comprehensive risk management programme which applies across all of its sites to minimise potential disruption of supply to customers and patients. This issupported by independent risk assessment of each manufacturing site. The Group continues todrive down risk in its sites with a robust risk management approach and a strongenvironmental, health and safety risk reduction programme. Supply continuity is also supportedby the Group's history of strong relations with its site-based employees and unionrepresentatives - presently, fewer than 50 per cent. of the Group's sites are unionised. The Group sources from approximately 2,500 direct material suppliers in approximately 65 countries. While, in broad terms, packaging supply and raw material supply takes place at alocal or regional level, the sourcing and supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients and 109 excipients is typically at a global level. To assist the mitigation of packaging and raw material sourcing risks, the Group operates a dual-sourcing programme, which prioritises critical itemswhere risk is highest and revenue dependency is significant. As of 31 December 2021,75-80 per cent. of the Group's materials supply by spend was sourced from more than onesupplier and it expects this to increase to 85-90 per cent. by the end of 2023. Where dualsourcing is not expedient or feasible, for example with unique specification materials (such assupplier IP-owned flavours, or bespoke/IP-owned packaging applications), the Group mitigatesrisk through holding higher inventories and sourcing from multiple production sites owned bythe same supplier. Enabling the Group's sustainability agendaThe supply network plays a key part in the delivery of the Group's ambitious sustainability goals with a number of key initiatives. To support the global efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change, the Group has implemented renewable electricity generation at 12 of its 24 internal sites and is aiming toreduce its net Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 100 per cent. by 2030 (versus its 2020baseline). The Group's supply network is also implement ing a broad range of other environmental and sustainability initiatives. For example, the Group achieved Zero Waste to Landfill certificationacross its network in 2021 and expects to achieve sustainable sourcing of palm oil in 2025. Froma product perspective, the introduction of 100 per cent. recyclable toothpaste tubes and carbon-neutral plastic-free toothbrushes has commenced in Europe and the Group is working towardsthe implementation of pioneering recycling solutions for tubes and blister packs by 2030. 10. Intellectual Property10.1 Trade marks The Group's meaningful and distinctive brands are of central importance to its business. Accordingly, the Group employs a global trade mark strategy to ensure that it has extensiveand geographically wide-reaching trade mark coverage to protect their reputation and goodwill.As of 1 March 2022, the Group owns 30,368 trade mark registrations and applications inmultiple jurisdictions worldwide. These are managed centrally at Group level in order to ensurerobust portfolio management and consistency. The Group's Power Brands have the most extensive level of trade mark coverage, with rights filed to cover relevant word marks and logos in all major markets. Local strategic brands in theGroup's key markets have coverage in their relevant markets. There is also substantialcoverage for the Group's other leading brands worldwide. Along with the comprehensiveworldwide coverage, the Group has particularly extensive trade mark protection for its productsin the USA and China, both being key markets for the Group. The Group has adopted the trade mark HALEON as its corporate name. Prior to adoption, extensive brand clearance work was carried out in all key markets across the full range ofgoods and services that the Group operates in, and anticipates operating in, and clearance insuch key markets was obtained. Trade mark applications have been filed in all countries inwhich the Group operates. The Group has worldwide exclusive, royalty-free and sub-licensable licences for certain OTC products from both Novartis (including Voltaren and Lamisil) and GSK (including Flixonase,Bactroban and Zovirax). These licences to the shared brands are perpetual, subject to materialbreach by or insolvency of the relevant member of the Group, and exclusive in relation toconsumer healthcare products, subject to customary exclusions. 110 Additionally, the Group licenses certain brands to and from third parties, including Nexium (OTC only), which is a worldwide in-licence from AstraZeneca (excluding Brazil); Nicorette,which is a US in-licence from Johnson & Johnson; and Nicoderm, which is a US in-licence fromSanofi. The TSK&F Joint Venture in China markets several of the Group's OTC brands locally (including Contac, Fenbid and Bactroban). The main trade marks for the marketed productsare generally owned by, or licensed to (from GSK or Novartis as shared brands), the Groupand licensed to the TSK&F Joint Venture. The Group routinely monitors the trade mark activities of competitors and takes timely legal action to appropriately enforce its trade mark rights against infringing third parties and ensurethat the Group's brand reputation, goodwill and value are protected. This action is employedthrough infringement litigation in courts, enforcement actions at national intellectual propertyauthorities or by direct negotiations. 10.2 Patents The Group employs a global patent strategy that endeavours to protect the Group's R&D innovations and commercial products and strengthen the Group's competitive position in theglobal consumer healthcare market. The Group currently has, as of 1 March 2022,approximately 1,500 granted patents and approximately 300 patent applications globally,including patents and patent applications relating to many of the Group's Power Brands. Patents in consumer healthcare play a vital, but different, role than patents in other health- oriented fields such as pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Consumer health-based patents rarely,if ever, solely cover a new active pharmaceutical compound by itself, because nearly allconsumer health-based products use well-known, established active pharmaceuticalcompounds whose original patents have long since expired. Instead, consumer health-basedpatents focus on all aspects of a product itself, such as the formulation, method ofmanufacturing, delivery device, packaging, method of treatment, and design. Through carefulevaluation of the different unique features of each consumer healthcare product, the Group'sproducts are often protected by multiple patents covering a variety of distinct features of theproduct. This results in less reliance on individual patents for a product's commercial success,and the inability to obtain patent protection for one feature of the product can often be offset bypatent protection of a different feature. Consequently, the Group does not consider any singlepatent to be critical to its overall financial health and success. The Group's global patent portfolio provides a number of competitive advantages in the consumer healthcare industry. The Group's diversified approach of patenting multiple featuresof a product make the market entry of competitors with copy products difficult. Moreover, manyof the Group's patents cover technology closely related to the Group's products, creating afurther buffer of patent protection. Particularly during the early stages of new product launches,patent protection delays competitor entry into the marketplace and provides a competitiveadvantage of time for exclusive development of brand goodwill and market share prior to laterentry of competing products. The existence of granted patent rights also enables the Group toadvertise, promote, and mark its products as being patented. This supports the Group'smarketing campaigns, builds endorsements from healthcare professionals and increasesconsumer awareness of innovative technology being used in the Group's products. Further,some of the Group's US patents, including certain patents covering some Advil products, coverproducts which qualify for listing in the US FDA Orange Book, which provides statutoryexclusivity periods. In addition to mitigating patent infringement risks, including through the active use of Freedom to Operate clearances early in the R&D process to assess potential liabilities presented bycompetitor patents, the Group's global patent strategy invests resources in offensivelyenforcing patent rights. The Group routinely monitors the activities of competitors and takestimely legal action to assert the Group's patent rights when appropriate. This allows the Groupto retain the competitive advantages provided by the patent portfolio and to protect marketshare by seeking legal remedies, such as injunctions or monetary damages, to deter, prevent,or delay competitor entry. 111 The Group's patent portfolio further generates value to the Group through the licensing of patents to outside parties covering technology that is not of commercial value to the Group.The patent portfolio can also be utilised as leverage during business negotiations, facilitatingthe creation of cross-licensing arrangements with competitors in lieu of litigation. The Group in-licenses certain third-party patents that support the Group's business goals, including patents from companies with technical expertise in particular areas that the Groupseeks to commercialise. The Group also partners with third parties to accelerate, develop, and/or commercialise new products in a cost-effective manner by utilising the knowledge ofexternal experts in a particular field. 10.3 Designs and other IP In addition to the Group's large patent and trade mark portfolios, the Group further strengthens brand value through protection of distinct brand designs, such as packaging designs. As of1 March 2022, the Group has 1,057 granted and pending designs which are managed centrallyat Group level. There is also copyright and unregistered intellectual property protection for packdesigns and unregistered brands to the extent available in a given country. 10.4 Domains As of 1 March 2022, the Group owns 5,815 domain names, which are managed centrally at Group level. Domain names for the Group's corporate names have also been reserved,including \"Haleon.com\" and \"Haleon.cn\". 11. Environmental, social and governance The Group's purpose is to deliver everyday health with humanity and this informs the Group's relationships with all of its stakeholders as well its approach to stewardship of naturalresources. The Group has ambitious goals in relation to health inclusivity, its environmentalimpact, and supporting the communities where it operates together with a commitment torobust corporate governance practices across its business so as to enable it to maximise itspositive impact on society. The Group's ESG strategy is led centrally by a core team of experts with representation on the management team and with a track record of ESG programme delivery in the consumer goodsand healthcare industries. Central strategy and coordination is complemented at a businessunit level by the incorporation of ESG objectives into the Group's operational and performancetargets, ensuring that ESG is integral to how it manages its business and drives value creationfor all of its stakeholders. Tackling environmental issues impacting everyday healthThe Group's commitments to a healthy environment can be seen in four areas in particular: (i) carbon and climate change; (ii) sustainable healthcare packaging; (iii) trusted ingredients,sustainably sourced; and (iv) operational waste and water. The commitments are brought to lifethrough product innovations. With respect to carbon and climate change, the Group understands the impacts of fossil fuel emissions and a warming planet on human health, whether it be through the impacts ofextreme weather events, the exposure of new regions to climate-driven infectious diseases orthe direct risks posed by air pollution to respiratory and cardiovascular health. Building on thesteps already taken while part of the GSK Group, the Group is taking a robust approach toaddressing its carbon footprint. To support the global efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change, the Group has implemented renewable electricity generation at 12 of its 24 internal sites and is aiming to 112 reduce its carbon net Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 100 per cent. by 2030 (versus its 2020 baseline). The Group intends to self-generate renewable electricity or purchaserenewable energy certificates to cover the Group's total electricity usage by the end of 2022. Inaddition, the Group aims to reduce its Scope 3 emissions by 42 per cent. from source to saleby 2030 (versus its 2020 baseline). This level of carbon emissions reduction is aligned to theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 1.5 oC pathway. Following Separation, the Group intends to seek formal accreditation of its carbon commitments by the SBTi. The Group willalso set a long-term carbon net zero goal informed by the latest SBTi guidance. In packaging, the Group aims to develop solutions for all of its product packaging to be recycle- ready by 2025 and to be fully recyclable or reusable by 2030 where quality, safety andregulations permit. The Group aims to reduce its use of virgin petroleum-based plastic by10 per cent. by 2025 and one-third by 2030 versus its 2020 baseline. The Group will work withpartners to drive global and local initiatives to collect, sort and recycle consumer healthcarepackaging at scale by 2030. The Group looks to leverage external partnerships to achieve its environmental goals. It is part of the Pulpex partner consortium with Diageo, Unilever and PepsiCo, which looks atintroducing first-in-class pulp packaging made from sustainably sourced pulp. The Group isfurther exploring the design and piloting of Pulpex bottles across several key brands: in its OralHealth and OTC/VMS portfolios, including its global Power Brand Centrum. The Group aims for all of its agricultural, forest and marine derived materials to be sustainably sourced and deforestation free by 2030. In 2020 the Group's sites that were its largest users ofglycerine, its most material palm oil derivative, achieved Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 77 mass balance certification. As a next step in continuously improving the Group's sourcing ofsustainable palm oil, it is progressing towards buying physically certified palm oil derivatives.From 2022, the Group is providing funding towards several projects with ASD (Action forSustainable Derivatives) to drive positive impact on the ground by improving the livelihoods ofsmallholders and providing support to increase the availability of sustainable sourced palm oil. With respect to operational waste and water, the Group aims for all of its sites to achieve the Alliance for Water Stewardship (\" AWS \") Standard 78by 2025, with all sites in water-stressed basins to be water-neutral by 2030. One achievement in this area is at the Cape Town site,which is located in a high-stress water basin. Here, the Group has reduced its waterconsumption by over 50 per cent. since 2010 and the site is on track to become the first water-neutral site across the manufacturing network by the end of 2022. The Group aims for all of its manufacturing sites to achieve TRUE certification by 2030. 79 Additionally, the Group has been implementing its sustainability agenda through its product innovations. The carbon-neutral Dr.BEST Green Clean toothbrush is an example of sustainable innovation. It begins with renewable raw material sourcing from sustainable forestsand bio-composite material from the woodwork industry for the handle, has bristles made from100 per cent. castor oil, and has plastic-free packaging. To better understand the brush's improved carbon footprint, the Group engaged with specialist consultancy firm, Climate Partner, which found the footprint was reduced by more than50 per cent. when compared with the standard Dr.BEST toothbrush. The remaining footprint is 77Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (\"RSPO\") is a not for profit organisation with over 4000 members, dedicated to developing and implementing global standards for sustainable palm oil. The RSPO has developed a set of environmental and social criteriawhich companies must comply with in order to produce Certified Sustainable Palm Oil. When they are properly applied, thesecriteria can help to minimise the negative impact of palm oil cultivation on the environment and communities in palm oilproducing regions. 78AWS is a global alliance between businesses, NGOs and the public sector promoting good water stewardship. The AWS Standard is a globally applicable framework for major water users to understand their water use and impacts, and to workcollaboratively and transparently for sustainable water management. 79TRUE is the first zero waste certification programme dedicated to measuring, improving and recognising zero waste performance by encouraging the adoption of sustainable materials management and reduction practices which contribute topositive environmental, health and economic outcomes. 113 offset through a community-based Climate Partner project in Madagascar. The Group is working on further innovation to reduce the carbon footprint even further with the ultimate goalof reducing it to zero. InclusivityHealth inclusivity is fundamental to the Group's purpose to deliver everyday health with humanity, as everyday health is impacted by social exclusion and as bias and stigma preventpeople from accessing better everyday health. The Group is taking a leading position ineducating and empowering people to achieve better self-care and to provide accessible,affordable health care solutions through its products. The Group aims to empower millions of people a year to be more included in opportunities for better everyday health, empowering 50 million people a year by 2025. It aims to achieve this inthree key ways: (i) driving change through its brands; (ii) empowering self-care; and(iii) investing in thought leadership and research. The Group's social impact from suchactivities will be measured according to the nature of the activity. For example, the Groupdeveloped an inclusive easy-to-open cap for Voltarol pain relief gel and will count the numberof potential arthritis sufferers rather than the total number of purchases in its reporting. The Group is collaborating with The Economist Group to develop an index to promote awareness of health inclusivity and ongoing and productive dialogue with policymakers andhealthcare professionals. The programme assesses the state of health inclusivity in 40countries across four to five indicators (increasing to 80 countries in later phases), with thedata being made available to consumers and stakeholders though an interactive index hub. The index will be hosted on The Economist website in an interactive hub to enable open access so that stakeholders can use the data to perform their own analyses. In the first year,this output will be used to raise awareness and build further understanding of the drivers ofhealth inclusivity. It is intended to facilitate meaningful dialogue with and among keystakeholder groups who share an interest in improving health inclusivity, particularly investors,policymakers, healthcare professionals and external experts, as well as the media, consumersand customers. The outputs will equip the Group with insights to inform its own actions andhelp identify opportunities for partnerships and wider coalitions of action in the medium tolonger term to drive health inclusivity. The Group has also seen the synergistic benefits of its inclusivity focus in driving preference and growth among retailers in multiple markets. For example, the US Tums \"Bring Diversity tothe Table\" campaign run at Walmart in 2020, which donated culinary and nutrition scholarshipswith the Thurgood Marshall College fund, was awarded incremental displays in over 3,300Walmart stores during the competitive holiday period and helped to deliver an increase inrevenue for the Tums brand. Corporate governanceThe Group strives for best-in-class corporate governance, which can be illustrated in three areas. First, at a Board level, the Chair and Directors have been selected based upon thecapabilities, experience, diversity and regulatory requirements for a consumer healthcarecompany. The Directors have a commitment to transparent reporting and disclosure and aresubject to a robust code of conduct. Second, Board-level governance and committees have been established to ensure alignment with all requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code (see paragraph 3 of Part V(Directors, Senior Managers, Corporate Governance and Remuneration )). Third, the Group's internal and external operational governance links in directly to Board-level governance, enabling rapid escalation and visibility. This includes a focus on key performanceindicators, principal risks, supplier code of conduct and quality requirements, internal employeetraining and the use of responsibility scorecards to promote the right behaviours. 114 PART IV OVERVIEW OF THE DEMERGER AND SEPARATION 1. The Demerger and further preparatory steps On 23 June 2021, GSK announced its intention to effect the separation of the Consumer Healthcare Business by way of a demerger of at least 80 per cent. of GSK's 68 per cent.holding in the Group. The Demerger is conditional on, amongst other things, the approval ofGSK Shareholders at the GSK General Meeting, the receipt of certain mandatorygovernmental/regulatory approvals in India, Japan and South Korea, and the approval of theDemerger Dividend by the GSK Board. Pursuant to the proposed Demerger, GSK Shareholders who are registered on the Register at the Shareholder Record Time will be entitled to receive one Haleon Share for each GSK Shareheld by them at the Shareholder Record Time. GSK Shareholders will continue to own theirGSK Shares unless they sell or transfer them in the usual course. 1.1 Overview of the Demerger and Share Exchanges Pursuant to the proposed Demerger and subsequent Share Exchanges described below, the Company will come to own the entire issued share capital of each of GSKCHH and PFCHHwhich, together, own the entire issued share capital of CH JVCo, the current parent companyof the Group. Current structure of the GroupAt present, the structure of the Group is as follows: The share capital of CH JVCo consists of: (i) 680,000 JVCo 300,000 Preference B OrdinaryShares of \u00a31 each. The JVCo A Ordinary Shares and JVCo B Ordinary Shares each carry onevote per share. Holders of the JVCo Preference Shares are entitled to 0.01 per cent. of theaggregate amount of any dividends declared by CH JVCo, and are not entitled to anyproportion of the assets of CH JVCo available for distribution to shareholders on a return ofcapital on a winding-up of CH JVCo (excluding any intra-group re-organisation on a solventbasis). All JVCo A Ordinary Shares and JVCo Preference Shares are held by GSKCHH. AllJVCo B Ordinary Shares are held by PFCHH, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. 115 Accordingly, the share capital of CH JVCo is held as follows: Shareholder Class Voting rights Nominal Value GSKCHH JVCo A Ordinary Shares 68 per cent. 75.38 per cent. JVCo Preference Shares N/A PFCHH JVCo B Ordinary Shares 32 per cent. 24.62 per cent. The share capital of GSKCHH is comprised of three classes of shares: (i) GSKCHH A Ordinary Shares; (ii) GSKCHH B Ordinary Shares; and (iii) GSKCHH C Ordinary Shares. At present, allof the GSKCHH A Ordinary Shares and GSKCHH B Ordinary Shares are held by GSK. As partof certain arrangements to fund GSK's UK pension benefit obligations, on 25 March 2022, GSKtransferred its entire holding of GSKCHH C Ordinary Shares to the SLPs (being ScottishLimited Partnerships controlled by GSK). DemergerThe Demerger will be implemented by GSK declaring an interim dividend in specie to be satisfied by: (i) the transfer by GSK of the GSKCHH A Ordinary Shares to the Company, inreturn for (ii) the issuance of Haleon Shares by the Company to GSK Shareholders who areregistered on the Register at the Shareholder Record Time on the basis of one Haleon Sharefor each GSK Share held by such GSK Shareholders at the Shareholder Record Time, savethat the number of Haleon Shares to be allotted and issued to each of the four initialshareholders of the Company (each of whom is a GSK Shareholder) will be reduced by thenumber of Haleon Shares already held by them at the Shareholder Record Time. GSKShareholders will continue to own their GSK Shares unless they sell or transfer them in theusual course. Share ExchangesShortly following completion of the Demerger, a series of share-for-share exchanges will occur, under which the Company will come to own the entire issued share capital of GSKCHH andPFCHH, which together own the entire issued share capital of CH JVCo. The purpose of theshare-for-share exchanges is to rationalise the Company's shareholder structure such that allpersons with an interest in the Group do so through holding shares in the Company, as listedparent company, and not further down the Group structure. Accordingly: (A) GSK will transfer its entire shareholding of GSKCHH B Ordinary Shares, representing an 8.01 per cent. stake in the ordinary share capital of GSKCHH, to the Company for502,868,434 Haleon Shares, less a number of Haleon Shares that is equal to the numberof Excess GSK Shares. 80As at the Latest Practicable Date, the number of Haleon Shares expected to be held by GSK at Admission is expected to represent up to 6 percent. of the total issued share capital of the Company (the \" GSK Share Exchange \"); (B) each of the SLPs will transfer their respective holdings of GSKCHH C Ordinary Shares, representing 11.03 per cent. in aggregate of the ordinary share capital of GSKCHH, tothe Company in consideration for such number of new Haleon Shares as is required sothat, on Admission, the SLPs will together hold Haleon Shares representing 7.5 per cent.(in aggregate and to the nearest whole Haleon Share) of the total issued share capital ofthe Company; and 80To the extent any shares are issued by GSK (e.g. in respect of GSK employee share options) between the Latest Practicable Date and the Shareholder Record Time, this would affect the post-Separation shareholdings in the Company. In summary, theeffect of any such issuance would be that: (i) the total number of Haleon Shares issued to Shareholders under the Demergerwould increase by the number of GSK Excess Shares; and (ii) there would be a corresponding reduction in the total number ofHaleon Shares issued to GSK under the GSK Share Exchange. 116 (C) Pfizer will transfer its entire holding in PFCHH to the Company in consideration for: (i) such number of new Haleon Shares as is required so that, on Admission, Pfizer willhold Haleon Shares representing 32 per cent. of the total issued share capital of theCompany (to the nearest whole Haleon Share); and (ii) 25 million Non-Voting PreferenceShares (the \" Pfizer Share Exchange \"), together, the \" Share Exchanges \". Immediately following the Pfizer Share Exchange, Pfizer will sell its entire holding in the Non-Voting Preference Shares to one or more third party investor(s) (the \" NVPS Sale \"). Through the Demerger, the Share Exchanges and the NVPS Sale, the ordinary share capital of the Company will be held as follows: Shareholder Class Voting rights Nominal Value GSK Shareholders Ordinary At least 54.5 per cent. At least 54.5 per cent. Pfizer Ordinary 32 per cent. 32 per cent.SLPs (Scottish partnerships controlled by GSK)Ordinary 7.5 per cent. 7.5 per cent. GSK Ordinary Up to 6 per cent. Up to 6 per cent. 1.2 Pre-Separation Dividends Prior to Separation, the Group will pay certain dividends to GSKCHH and/or PFCHH. These dividends will include: (A) a cash dividend to be paid by the Group to GSKCHH in connection with the issuance of the Non-Voting Preference Shares to Pfizer (the \" Balancing Dividend \"); (B) a cash dividend to be paid by the Group to GSKCHH and PFCHH, in accordance with the terms of the Pfizer SHA, which, in summary, requires an amount equal to thePre-Separation Debt Proceeds of the Group less \u00a3300 million to be paid to GSKCHH andPFCHH prior to Separation (the \" Pre-Demerger Dividend \"); and (C) following the payment of the Balancing Dividend and the Pre-Demerger Dividend, a cash dividend to be paid by the Group to GSKCHH and PFCHH, in accordance with the terms 117 of the Pfizer SHA which, in summary, requires all readily available cash in excess of \u00a3300 million to be paid to GSKCHH and PFCHH prior to Separation (the \" Sweep-up Dividend \"), (together, the \" Pre-Separation Dividends \"). The minimum cash amount of \u00a3300 million in the calculation of the Sweep-Up Dividend reflects the base cash amount required under the Pfizer SHA. The recipients of the Pre-SeparationDividends reflect the current structure of the Group, as set out above. Prior to the Pre-Separation Dividends, the Group will continue to pay its ordinary course, quarterly dividends to GSKCHH and PFCHH in accordance with the terms of the Pfizer SHA(including, a dividend to be paid in respect of the Group's financial performance for Q1 2022). 1.3 Pre-Separation bond issuances As part of the preparation for the Demerger, on 16 March 2022, GSK Consumer Healthcare Capital UK plc and GSK Consumer Healthcare Capital NL B.V. acting as issuers (the \" EMTN Issuers \") established a \u00a310,000,000,000 Euro Medium Term Note Programme (the \"Programme \") pursuant to which the EMTN Issuers may issue notes from time to time.

The payment of all amounts owing in respect of: (i) notes issued under the Programme (including the Pre-Separation Programme Notes); and (ii) the Pre-Separation USD Notes is, asat the date of this Prospectus, guaranteed by GSK (see paragraph 15.13 of Part XII ( Additional Information ) for further information). Following completion of the GSK Share Exchange, the guarantee provided by GSK will cease to be effective and a guarantee provided by theCompany will come into full force and effect. Further details of the terms and conditionsgoverning the notes issued under the Programme and the Pre-Separation USD Notes can befound at paragraph 15.13 of Part XII ( Additional Information ). The net proceeds of the Pre-Separation Programme Notes and the Pre-Separation USD Notes have been made available to GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Finance Limited in orderto fund the making of certain upstream loans to wholly-owned subsidiaries of GSK and Pfizer.As such: (A) on 24 March 2022, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Finance Limited made a loan of \u00a34,465,197,183.55 to GlaxoSmithKline Finance plc and a loan of \u00a32,101,269,262.85 toPfizer Service Company Ireland Unlimited Company; and (B) on 29 March 2022, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Finance Limited made a loan of \u00a31,798,139,950.68 to GlaxoSmithKline Finance plc and a loan of \u00a3846,183,506.20 toPfizer Service Company Ireland Unlimited Company, (together, the \" Notes Proceeds Loans \") pursuant to certain upstream loan agreements as amended from time to time (the \" Notes Proceeds Loan Agreements \"). 118 The terms of the Notes Proceeds Loan Agreements require, among other things, that the Notes Proceeds Loans will be repaid in full to GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare FinanceLimited on 13 July 2022 or such other date as agreed between the parties in writing. Followingrepayment of the Notes Proceeds Loans, the amounts received by GlaxoSmithKline ConsumerHealthcare Finance Limited will be made available to CH JVCo in order to fund a portion of thePre-Demerger Dividend. 1.4 The Group's asset perimeter On or around the date of this Prospectus, GSK, GSKCHH and CH JVCo entered into the Asset Transfer Framework Agreement, which sets out the framework for transferring certainbusinesses, assets, liabilities and employees that were excluded from the original perimeter ofthe GSK/Pfizer JV as contemplated in the Pfizer SAPA and others that were included in theoriginal perimeter of the GSK/Pfizer JV but had not yet legally transferred or to record thetransfer of \"wrong pocket\" assets under the Pfizer SAPA, in each case from the GSK Group tothe Group (where a \"wrong pocket\" asset or liability is one that parties have identified asincorrectly being transferred, or not transferred, to the other party in line with the principles ofthe Pfizer SAPA) (see also paragraph 15.2 of Part XII ( Additional Information )). The Asset Transfer Framework Agreement also sets out the framework for transferring certain businesses, assets, liabilities and employees from the Group to the GSK Group to record thetransfer of \"wrong pocket\" assets under the Pfizer SAPA, and to remove assets from the Groupthat do not relate to the Consumer Healthcare Business, in each case from the Group to theGSK Group.

Intangible amortisation and impairments arising from intangibles acquired in businesscombinations are adjusted to reflect the performance of the business excluding the effect ofacquisition accounting. It is the Group's view that acquired intangible assets by their nature are fundamentally different from other depreciating assets that are replaced on a predictable cycle. The Group excludes theimpact of non-cash amortisation associated with acquired intangible assets as this is not directlyattributable to the sale of the Group's products and varies from period to period, which affectscomparability of the Group's financial results. The costs to operate, maintain and extend the life ofacquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property are reflected in the Group'soperating costs as labour, overheads, etc. Restructuring costs Include personnel costs associated with restructuring programmes, impairments of tangible assets and computer software relating to specific programmes approved by the Board from time to timethat are structural and of a significant scale, where the costs of individual or related projectsexceed \u00a315 million. Restructuring costs also include integration costs following an acquisition,including in relation to personnel, manufacturing sites, real estate and IT infrastructure. Theseprogrammes can take several years to complete and are not directly attributable to the sale of theGroup's products. Further, costs associated with these programmes vary from period to period,which affects comparability of the Group's financial results. Restructuring costs do not include Separation and Admission costs (see \" Separation and Admission costs \" below). Transaction-related costs Transaction-related accounting or other adjustments related to significant acquisitions. These costs are adjusted as they arise as a result of business combinations. In FY 2019 and FY 2020,these costs were related to the unwind of inventory fair value adjustments in connection with thePfizer Transaction, which was completed by the end of FY 2020. These costs are not directlyattributable to the sale of the Group's products and vary from period to period, which affectscomparability of the Group's financial results. Separation and Admission costs Costs incurred in relation to and in connection with the Demerger, Separation, Admission, and registration of Haleon Shares represented by Haleon ADSs and of Haleon ADSs under the USExchange Act and listing of Haleon ADSs on the NYSE. These costs are not directly attributable tothe sale of the Group's products and specifically relate to the foregoing activities, affectingcomparability of the Group's financial results in historic and future reporting periods. Disposals and others Gains and losses on disposals of assets, businesses and tax indemnities related to business combinations, and other items. These gains and losses are not directly attributable to the sale ofthe Group's products and vary from period to period, which affects comparability of the Group'sfinancial results. 140 5.3 Organic revenue growth The following tables reconcile reported revenue growth for the three months ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 to organic revenue growth for the same period by geographical segment andby product category.

Overview The Group is a world-leading consumer healthcare business, with a portfolio of category leading brands and approximately 23,000 people worldwide engaged in the research anddevelopment, manufacture and sale of a broad range of consumer healthcare products. The Group conducts business internationally across five consumer healthcare categories: Oral Health, Pain Relief, VMS, Respiratory Health and Digestive Health and Other. The Group's international presence is organised into three geographic regions, which are the Group's reporting segments: North America, EMEA and LatAm and APAC.

Organic revenue growth in North America was 1.3 per cent. for this period,as compared to 0.7 per cent. for the period FY 2019 to FY 2020. EMEA and LatAmThe diverse EMEA and LatAm region is divided into seven business units: Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe (including the Commonwealth of IndependentStates), Russia, DACH (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), Middle East and Africa and LatAm(Brazil, Colombia and Wider LatAm). As at 31 March 2022, approximately 12,300 personnel 82 were engaged in the Group's operations in EMEA and LatAm. EMEA and LatAm accounted for 40.6 per cent. of the Group's revenue for FY 2021.

Key factors affecting the Group's results of operations and financial position The Group's results of operations and financial condition are affected by a variety of factors, a number of which are outside the control of the Group. Set out below is a discussion of the mostsignificant factors that have affected the Group's financial results during the periods underreview and which the Directors currently expect to affect its financial results in the future.Factors other than those presented below could also have a significant impact on the Group'sresults of operations and financial condition in the future. 2.1 Impact of macroeconomic factors and market trends on discretionary consumer spending The Group's business is impacted by fluctuations in demand for the Group's products as a result of changes in discretionary consumer spending. Demand for the Group's products is generally impacted by macroeconomic conditions which affect disposable income of consumers and discretionary consumer spending. The prevailingglobal economic climate, inflation, levels of employment, disposable income, salaries, wagerates, interest rates, geopolitical and political uncertainty, fiscal policy (particularly on publichealthcare), taxation, consumer confidence, consumer perception of economic conditions andglobal pandemics, are all factors that affect the Group's business. For example, in FY 2020,the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Group's operations (see paragraph2.14 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below). In addition, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has had an adverse effect on the global geopolitical and economic environment,although the broader economic consequences of the invasion are currently difficult to predict(see paragraph 3 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below). Demand is also influenced by evolving consumer tastes and trends in discretionary consumer spending on consumer healthcare products. Trends evidenced during the periods under reviewinclude an increasing focus on self-management of health and wellbeing, an ageing population,an increasing demand for natural products (consumer healthcare products that arenon-medicated, 'free from' particular ingredients, or that include plant-based, herbal or othernaturally occurring ingredients), premiumisation (where consumers switch their purchases topremium alternatives) and the countervailing trend toward \"private-label\" products (brands soldexclusively by a particular retailer, which are typically sold at lower prices than brandedproducts), sustainability, and the convergence of digital and healthcare. The Group benefits from the increasing consumer focus on health and wellbeing, with the most pronounced impact in the Pain Relief and VMS categories. Further, increased demand for 83Full-time equivalent employees and agency staff (rounded to the nearest 100). 148 preventative and therapeutic products associated with an ageing population has a positive impact on the Group's Pain Relief and Oral Health categories. In the periods under review, theGroup's results were impacted by premiumisation trends. For example, in FY 2020, this trendadversely impacted sales of Aquafresh, the Group's everyday toothpaste brand, whereasSensodyne, as a premium brand, benefited from the trend. Revenue in FY 2020 and FY 2021was also affected by a number of \"private-label\" product launches; for example, such launchesresulted in reduced demand in the USA for Abreva in FY 2020 and Voltaren in FY 2021. The success of the Group depends on its ability to navigate and respond to changes in discretionary consumer spending. In turn, this ability is contingent on a number of factors,including competitive and market dynamics, brand strength, product offering, innovation andpricing (see paragraphs 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below and paragraph 1.2 of Risk Factors ). 2.2 Competition in the consumer healthcare market The Group's operating and financial performance is affected by competition in the geographic regions and product categories in which it operates. The Group faces competition fromcompanies that produce and sell competing products in an industry that is experiencingconsolidation. Consumer preference for branded, generic or private label products sold bycompetitors adversely impacts the Group's financial performance. The Group's competitors, which differ within individual geographic markets, include large-scale retailers, smaller high-growth companies (which often operate on a regional basis and offeraggressive competition), multinational corporations moving into or expanding their presence inthe consumer healthcare market, and \"private-label\" products sold by retailers (principally inthe US market) (see paragraph 1.4 of Risk Factors ). While the convergence of digital commerce and health aids the prospects for consumer healthcare market size growth, theGroup faces considerable competition from e-commerce retailers and large-scale retailers withexpansive digital operations. Competitive factors impacting the Group's business include market dynamics and evolving consumer preferences, brand image, a diversified product portfolio, new product innovationsand product development, pricing that is attractive to consumers, and cost inputs (seeparagraphs 2.1, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.10 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review )). Other competitive factors include supply chain (procurement, manufacturing and distribution) (seeparagraph 2.7 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below), the management of sales and marketing activities, and access to cash for investment in the Group's business (seeparagraph 2.11 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below). 2.3 Brand and product portfolio The Group's success is driven, to a large extent, by the strength of its brands and its ability to leverage its diversified portfolio to drive increased sales, profits and cash generation. TheGroup invests in R&D and marketing activities in order to maintain the long-term health of itsbrands and products and grow value, with investment allocation varying year-to-year acrossthe portfolio. The Group's product portfolio is split among five categories: Oral Health, Pain Relief, VMS, Respiratory Health and Digestive Health and Other. The Group's largest category by revenueis Oral Health, which accounted for 28.5 per cent. of the Group's revenue in FY 2021. The Pain 149 Relief and Digestive Health and Other categories also significantly contribute to revenue, respectively contributing 23.4 per cent. and 20.4 per cent. of revenue in FY 2021. VMS andRespiratory Health respectively accounted for 15.7 per cent. and 11.9 per cent. of revenue inFY 2021. Operating profit margin also varies across the Group's portfolio. The Group's sales volumes and profits depends in part on the Group's ability to identify and offer products at prices that appeal to changing consumer needs and preferences. Through netrevenue management, the Group analyses pricing, discounting and promotional initiativesacross the regions in which it operates in order to optimise sales volumes and revenue andsupport revenue growth and margin expansion. Pricing and discounting of the Group'sproducts is influenced by a number of factors, including competitive and market dynamics(including competitive pricing behaviours), brand recognition and brand loyalty, innovation andmarketing activities, supply chain (procurement, manufacturing and distribution), regulation andother cost inputs (see paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.7, 2.10 and 2.16 of this Part VII(Operating and Financial Review )). Price increases contribute to revenue growth and cash generation and support operating profit margin. Conversely, discounting dilutes operating profitmargin and impacts revenue growth and cash generation. During the periods under review, anumber of price increases and discounting initiatives affected the Group's financialperformance. The Group's Power Brands benefit from strong brand recognition and loyalty among consumers. While maintaining this recognition and loyalty requires greater investment inadvertising and promotion relative to the rest of the portfolio, the Power Brands have highergross margins. The Power Brands also typically account for the majority of the Group'srevenue and have the highest growth. Accordingly, the Power Brands contribute significantly torevenue growth. The Group's local strategic brands also benefit from strong brand recognitionand loyalty among consumers. As a result, the profitability of local strategic brands is typicallycomparable to the profitability of the Power Brands, and a number of the local strategic brandsin particular contribute significantly to revenue across the regions (for example, Tums,Emergen-C, Flonase and Excedrin in the US, Caltrate and Fenbid in China and Dr. Best in Germany). Investment in and growth rates of local strategic brands vary. Other brands in theGroup's portfolio typically have lower levels of investment and have lower gross margins, butthese brands support overall profitability and consolidate the Group's competitive position inthe geographic regions and categories in which it operates. The Group's results may fluctuatefrom year to year depending on the proportion of sales volume represented by higher-marginbrands. The Group relies on its ability to leverage brand recognition and consumer loyalty in responding to changing consumer trends and unmet consumer needs. Further, the success ofnew product launches depends in part on the strength of the Group's existing brands. In theperiods under review, a number of products were launched under the Group's Power Brandsand local strategic brands (see paragraph 4 of Part III ( Business Overview )). These launches contributed significantly to growth in FY 2020 and FY 2021. Competitive pressures from companies that produce and sell competing branded, generic and \"private-label\" products affect consumer preference for the Group's brands and products, whichin turn impacts the Group's operating and financial performance (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) above). The Group's performance is also influenced by consumer perception of its brands and products. In FY 2020, negative media coverage impacted consumer perception of the efficacy 150 of ibuprofen products in treating the symptoms of COVID-19, which adversely impacted sales of Advil (an ibuprofen-based product) in FY 2020. The impact of this on the Group's overallperformance during this period was more than mitigated by growth in Panadol (a paracetamol-based product), illustrating that the Group's diversified and balanced portfolio of products canprovide a certain level of protection against negative consumer trends and adversemacroeconomic factors. However, the Group's reliance on the strength of its brands to driverevenue, operating profit margin and cash generation makes it vulnerable to reputationaldamage and changes in consumer perception. The Group actively manages its portfolio. In the periods under review, the brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction made an important contribution to the Group's geographicpresence, revenue and operating profit margin (see paragraph 2.12 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below). Alongside the acquisition of the Pfizer brands, the Group continued to optimise and rationalise its portfolio by divesting a number of lower-growth brandswith limited synergies with the rest of the portfolio (see paragraph 2.13 of this Part VII(Operating and Financial Review ) below). The Group will continue to assess further brand acquisitions and disposals in the context of its strategy and capital allocation priorities (seeparagraph 2 of Part III ( Business Overview )). 2.4 Innovation The development and introduction of new products to the Group's portfolio contributes to revenue growth and cash generation and supports operating profit margins. Productdevelopment also supports portfolio diversification, which helps to minimise the effect ofnegative consumer trends and adverse market cycles (see paragraph 2.3 of this Part VII(Operating and Financial Review ) above). The Group typically incurs incremental R&D costs in the period prior to the launch of a new product, with advertising and promotion costs generallyincurred in connection with the launch and in subsequent periods. Investment in advertisingand promotion impacts visibility of the product in the market, which in turn influences thesuccess of a new product. Revenue growth attributable to a newly launched product is typicallyhigher in the period immediately following launch, reflecting peak consumer interest, followingwhich sales of the product begin to stabilise and the impact of market factors (such ascompetition from competitors) on revenue becomes more pronounced. Throughout the periods under review, the Group continued to develop and diversify its product portfolio. As a consequence, the Group benefited from a number of product launches,particularly in relation to the Power Brands and local strategic brands. For example, in APAC,Caltrate revenue growth in the periods under review was partly driven by new productdevelopment and launches, such as the launch of a range of Caltrate calcium supplementswith gender specific positioning. The switch of prescription products to OTC status (see paragraph 8 of Part III ( Business Overview )) forms part of the Group's innovation strategy. The process for such switches is highly regulated and requires significant organisational resource and expenditure over anumber of years. This includes expenditure to support clinical studies, label comprehension (inorder to ensure that consumers understand the product and any side effects) and consumerstudies. Following approval by the regulator, the Group typically incurs advertising and promotion costs in connection with the launch of an Rx-to-OTC switch product and in subsequent periods. Anyfailure to develop and commercialise new products in a timely fashion may decrease revenueand/or increase R&D costs (see paragraph 1.5 of Risk Factors ). The Group may face 151 competition from similar \"private-label\" products following launch of an Rx-to-OTC switch product, which may negatively impact revenue growth attributable to the product. Typically, thelaunch of similar \"private-label\" products following an Rx-to-OTC switch results in a steepshort-term reduction in the revenue growth attributable to the product followed by a return togrowth albeit not at the same level as prior to the private label launch. In FY 2020 the Group successfully completed the Rx-to-OTC switch of Voltaren in the USA, which was a key driver for growth in North America that year. In FY 2021, Voltaren revenuewas adversely impacted by reduced demand in the USA resulting from increased competitionfrom \"private-label\" products and the stabilisation of revenue streams following launch. TheFDA approval in 2020 (and the subsequent launch in H2 2020) of Advil Dual Action as an OTCproduct contributed to revenue growth in the second half of FY 2020. The Group increasedmarketing investments in order to support these launches. 2.5 Expansion of e-commerce and digital capabilities Growing the Group's e-commerce sales has been and will continue to be a key focus for the Group. Revenue from e-commerce has grown from approximately 4 per cent. of total revenuein FY 2019 to around 8 per cent. of total revenue in FY 2021. The majority of the Group'se-commerce sales are generated on third party platforms (e.g. Amazon, Alibaba), as opposedto platforms hosted by the Group. During the periods under review, the Group also increased its investment in digital media and digital capabilities across the business, including in relation to advertising and promotion, R&Dand supply chain. For example, in the context of advertising and promotion, digital mediaadvertising accounted for approximately half of the Group's total media spend in FY 2021. TheGroup also invested in a range of digital tools and training programmes in order to enhance itsdigital capability and support growth of the business in an increasingly digital world. 2.6 Geographic market presence The Group has a strong global footprint and is focused on growth across the markets in which it already operates. The Group serves approximately 170 markets, with 36.9 per cent. of theGroup's revenue in FY 2021 generated in North America, 40.6 per cent. in EMEA and LatAm,and 22.5 per cent. in APAC. Adjusted operating profit margin across the geographic regionsvaries. In FY 2021, Adjusted operating profit margin was 23.5 per cent., 24.8 per cent., and21.5 per cent. in North America, EMEA and LatAm and APAC, respectively. This variation isultimately driven by a number of factors, including sales volume of higher margin brands,supply chain (procurement, manufacturing and distribution) and competitive dynamics, togetherwith required investment in R&D and marketing activities and other cost inputs. North AmericaThe North America region accounted for 36.9 per cent. (\u00a33,525 million) of Group revenue in FY 2021. The region includes the Group's largest single market, the USA, which accounted for89.0 per cent. (\u00a33,138 million) of revenue in North America and 32.9 per cent. of Grouprevenue in FY 2021. During the periods under review, the majority of the Group's revenue in North America was attributable to the Oral Health, Pain Relief and Digestive Health and Other categories. Thestrength of brands such as Sensodyne, Tums and Flonase was a key driver of growth during 152 these periods. The Pfizer Transaction provided the Group with meaningful incremental scale in North America, and brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction (including Centrum andEmergen-C) have also contributed significantly to Group revenue since it completed. EMEA and LatAmThe EMEA and LatAm region was the largest contributor to Group revenue in FY 2021, accounting for 40.6 per cent. (\u00a33,877 million) of Group revenue. The region is equally splitbetween emerging and developed markets 84with emerging markets making up four of the seven business units (Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, Middle East and Africa andLatAm). During the periods under review, the majority of the Group's revenue in EMEA and LatAm was attributable to the Oral Health and Pain Relief categories. The strength of brands such asSensodyne, parodontax, Panadol and Voltaren was a key driver of growth during theseperiods. APACThe APAC region accounted for 22.5 per cent. (\u00a32,143 million) of the Group's revenue in FY 2021. China is the largest market in APAC, accounting for 37.4 per cent. (\u00a3801 million) ofrevenue in APAC and 8.4 per cent. of Group revenue in FY 2021. During the periods under review, the majority of the Group's revenue in APAC was attributable to the Oral Health, VMS and Pain Relief categories. The strength of brands such asSensodyne, Panadol and Voltaren, as well as brands acquired as part of the PfizerTransaction, such as Centrum and Caltrate, was a key driver of revenue during these periods. 2.7 Supply chain The Group relies on global supply chains and manufacturing and distribution operations which are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements. The Group is exposed to anumber of factors that affect the sourcing, manufacturing, supply and pricing of the Group'sproducts on a short-term basis, including macroeconomic events. In particular, the Group hasexperienced and may continue to experience delays in deliveries due to supply chaininterruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, recent lockdowns in Chinahave had an impact on delivery of the Group's products and resources required for themanufacture of the Group's products to and from China. Further, the Group has been exposedto increases in commodity and oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine (see alsoparagraph 3 below). The Group has entered and may in the future enter into fixed pricecontracts or hedging arrangements in order to address increases in commodity prices and theireffect on the Group's ability to source materials for its products. However, if prices decrease,the Group will be unable to realise the benefit of the decrease due to fixed price contracts inplace. The Group may also be limited in its ability to pass on these price increases in the pricesit charges for its products. Competitive factors relating to the distribution of the Group'sproducts also influence the Group's performance. See also paragraph 1.3 of Risk Factors . The Group prioritises reliability of supply to ensure its customers and consumers receive the Group's products. The Group is exposed to factors that may affect its ability to provide thisreliable supply from time to time. These factors include interruptions in supply from the Group's 84Classification of developed and emerging markets sourced from The International Monetary Fund DataMapper 2022 . 153 own facilities or from third party facilities. Examples include issues at certain of the Group's own facilities affecting Advil supply in FY 2019 and FY 2021, Excedrin supply in FY 2019 andFY 2020 and Preparation H supply in FY 2021. The Group also manages its supply chain with a focus on supply continuity. For example, where feasible, the Group aims to manage packaging and raw material sourcing risks throughdual sourcing (where key inputs are sourced from more than one location in order to limit therisk of supply chain disruption). As of 31 December 2021, 75-80 per cent. of the Group'smaterials supply by spend was sourced from more than one supplier and it expects this toincrease to 85-90 per cent. by the end of 2023. The Group also runs capacity planningprocesses in order to proactively identify pressures on supply chain capacity and conductsassessments in order to assist management in determining the appropriate levels ofinvestment in facilities and equipment. The Group has manufacturing sites located around the world. However, where possible, the Group seeks to bring the manufacturing of its products within the region of sale. As a result,more than 80 per cent. of the Group's products are sourced in the region in which they aresold. Not only does this enable the Group to respond more efficiently to the needs ofconsumers, but it also forms part of the Group's natural hedging strategy (see paragraph 2.15of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review )). 2.8 Inflationary pressures and commodity prices The Group is exposed to inflationary pressures and commodity prices, which generally affect the Group through their impact on payroll and supply costs (including freight). For example,inflationary pressures in FY 2021 increased the Group's commodity, freight and payroll costs,which had an adverse impact on the Group's operating profit and operating profit margin. Whilethe Group may increase product prices in order to mitigate the impact of inflation, competitivepressures may constrain the Group's ability to fully recover any increased costs in this way,and so the Group may remain subject to market risk with respect to inflationary pressures andincreases in commodity prices. Where possible, the Group aims to manage its exposure to thisrisk primarily through forward buying of commodities. 2.9 Seasonality Revenue and cash flow in Respiratory Health is typically driven by seasonal demand for certain of the Group's products, including its cough, cold and flu, allergy and decongestant products.The impact of seasonality on revenue in the Respiratory Health category is largely the sameacross the Group's geographic regions. However, as Respiratory Health revenue accounts fora larger percentage of total revenue in North America and EMEA and LatAm, the impact ofseasonality is greater in these regions than in APAC. For example, FY 2021 Respiratory Healthrevenue accounted for 11.9 per cent. and 14.2 per cent. of total revenue in North America andEMEA and LatAm, respectively, and 7.6 per cent. of total revenue in APAC. Sales in countries in the Northern Hemisphere typically peak from September through to March, driven mainly by consumers purchasing products to self-medicate against cold and flusymptoms. Most of the seasonality impact is experienced in the Northern Hemisphere, wherethe Group's operations are concentrated. Because of the timing of these seasonal peaks, theGroup's first and fourth quarter results tend to show significantly more revenue in theRespiratory Health category compared to its second and third quarter results, although thistrend was less pronounced in FY 2021, when 53.2 per cent. of the Group's sales in Respiratory 154 Health occurred in the first and fourth quarters. It follows that the Group's results for the first and fourth quarters of each year may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may beexpected for a full financial year. The Group incurs significant additional expenses in advance of and during September through to Q1 of the following financial year in anticipation of higher sales during that period, includingcosts of additional inventory and marketing. Further, the Group's cash flow is affected by thisseasonality, with the Group experiencing lower cash flow during the second and third quartersof the financial year due to increases in seasonal inventory and lower sales during this period,in preparation for increased sales during the fourth quarter of the financial year and the firstquarter of the following financial year. Although the Group's SG&A and R&D costs, including personnel costs and administrative costs, are more evenly distributed during the financial year, these costs are exposed to somevariations. Cash flows in these areas also experience some variation. For example, employeebonus payments are accrued throughout the year but settled in March. The seasonality effect of cold and flu season was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This had a material adverse effect on revenue in the Respiratory Health category in the period1 August 2020 to and including the first half of FY 2021, reflecting the historically weak coldand flu season driven by government restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (seeparagraph 2.14 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below). However, revenue in Respiratory Health recovered during the second half of FY 2021, with Respiratory Healthrevenue returning to levels broadly consistent with the corresponding period in FY 2019towards the end of the year. During the period FY 2019 to FY 2020, the seasonality impact was more pronounced on an organic revenue growth basis. This is because organic revenue for the period FY 2019 to FY2020 excludes revenue attributable to brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction (suchas Robitussin) in respect of the period 1 January 2020 to 31 July 2020, which significantlycontributed to Group revenue in the period. Organic revenue for the period FY 2019 to FY2020 includes revenue attributable to brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction inrespect of the period 1 August 2020 to 31 December 2020; however, this period wassignificantly affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including in relation to theseasonality effect of cold and flu season (as described above). The Group is also impacted by the allergy season, the severity of which varies from year to year across the geographic regions in which the Group operates depending on a number offactors, including the weather and the intensity, timing and length of pollen season. A strongerallergy season tends to result in higher revenue attributable to the Group's TopicalDecongestant and Allergy Care products. For example, a stronger allergy season in Q2 2021relative to the prior year comparator was a key driver for revenue growth in Flonase. 2.10 Commercial execution and financial discipline The Group's cost inputs are influenced by a number of factors, including competitive and market dynamics, commercial capabilities, innovation and marketing activities, supply chain(including procurement, manufacturing and distribution), acquisitions and divestments, andseasonality. As an innovation-led business, R&D activities account for a significant proportionof the Group's costs. Further, the continued strength of the Group's brands is contingent on acompetitive level of expenditure on advertising and promotion. 155 The Group seeks to drive the disciplined and efficient use of resources in order to provide funding for brand growth and innovation, while delivering sustainable margin expansion andcash generation (see paragraph 2.11 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below). Following the transactions with Novartis and Pfizer (see paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3 of Part I ( Key Highlights and Development of the Group )), the Group has continued to implement a number of initiatives to drive sustainable manufacturing and supply chain efficiency improvementsincluding: \u0081 Streamlining of the Group's manufacturing and supply footprint from 41 manufacturing sites (inherited by the Group through arrangements as part of the GSK Group and thetransactions with Novartis and Pfizer) to 24 in 2021. \u0081 Reducing the number of contract manufacturing partners from more than 250 (inherited by the Group through arrangements as part of the GSK Group and the transactions withNovartis and Pfizer) to approximately 180 in 2022. \u0081 Streamlining and refreshing of the Group's distribution centre footprint from more than 200 in 2015 (inherited by the Group through arrangements as part of the GSK Group and thetransactions with Novartis and Pfizer) to approximately 90 in 2021. \u0081 Implementing ongoing initiatives to drive value from third-party expenditure and offset headwinds from inflation in input prices and commodities, including forward buying, valueengineering and new supplier introduction, as well as initiatives to ensure continuity ofsupply from the Group's third party partners through programmes such as the approval ofalternate suppliers for critical materials. \u0081 Implementing ongoing initiatives to drive site productivity and/or security of supply, including dual sourcing and localisation of Power Brands such as Voltaren, Sensodyne andCentrum. The Group has also sought to drive effective and efficient use of resources in the research, development, advertising and promotion of its brands, as well as the administration of theGroup's operations, through initiatives including: \u0081 Cost synergies generated by the Pfizer Transaction (see paragraph 2.12 of this Part VII (Operating and Financial Review ) below). \u0081 De-duplication of R&D functions, localisation of R&D roles and projects and rationalisation of the Group's R&D footprint from 9 sites in 2015 (inherited by the Group througharrangements as part of the GSK Group and the transactions with Novartis and Pfizer) to 4sites in 2021. \u0081 Rationalisation of creative production and media agencies from greater than 200 in 2019 to an expected total of 56 by the end of 2022. \u0081 Optimisation of e-commerce strength through increased investment in digital media (see paragraph 2.5 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review )), as well as strengthening execution in other channels, such as retail and pharmacy. For example, in the pharmacychannel, where engagement with pharmacy and healthcare professionals is a core tenet ofthe Group's strategy, the Group has expanded its digital capabilities in order to supportthese relationships and expand reach (e.g. the proprietary Healthpartner portal andwebinars). 156 \u0081 Ongoing non-manufacturing procurement initiatives leveraging the Group's global scale and strategic supplier relationships, as well as targeted efforts to maximise theeffectiveness of its investment in media and the efficiency of its support functions. During the periods under review, costs incurred in connection with the delivery of synergies arising out of the transaction with Novartis and the Pfizer Transaction were reflected asRestructuring costs and are treated as an Adjusting Item for the purposes of Adjustedoperating profit. Other costs incurred in connection with the initiatives referred to in thisparagraph were not excluded from Adjusted operating profit. 2.11 Cash generation The Group took a number of steps in the periods under review to drive cash generation from its operations, including: \u0081 tight management of receivables, inventory and payables;\u0081 disciplined capital expenditure, with strategic investment focused on supply chain and digital capabilities. This was reflected in a small increase in capital expenditure as apercentage of revenue to 3.1 per cent. in FY 2021 from 2.9 per cent. in FY 2019; and \u0081 the receipt of proceeds from the divestment of a number of the Group's non-core brands (see paragraph 2.13 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below). 2.12 Pfizer Transaction The Pfizer Transaction completed on 31 July 2019 (see paragraph 2.3 of Part I ( Key Highlights and Development of the Group )). The Group's results of operations and financial position have been affected in the periods under review, and will continue to be affected, as a consequenceof the Pfizer Transaction, including steps taken in connection with and following thetransaction. For example, in FY 2022 the Directors expect the Group to continue to benefitfrom synergies arising in connection with the Pfizer Transaction. The Group's revenue in FY 2020 was \u00a39,892 million. The Group's revenue in FY 2019 (including the revenue of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business from 1 August 2019, when it wasconsolidated) was \u00a38,480 million. Revenue of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business for theseven months to 31 July 2019 was \u00a31,523 million. From FY 2019 to FY 2020, the Group'srevenue increased by 16.7 per cent. (\u00a31,412 million) at AER. The increase was primarily drivenby the inclusion of the full year of revenue of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business in FY 2020,compared to five months of revenue in FY 2019, together with other factors (see paragraph6.1(A) of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below). The impact of the Pfizer Transaction therefore limits the comparability of the financial information of the Group for FY2019 and FY 2020. In the periods under review, the Group has achieved cost synergies as a consequence of the Pfizer Transaction. In particular, the Group has adopted a leaner structure to drive cost savingsacross a number of areas of the Group's business, including the supply chain network, logisticsand infrastructure, advertising and marketing, sales and distribution and functional support (seeparagraph 2.10 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) above). On 19 December 2018, GSK announced that the Pfizer Transaction was expected to realise annual cost savings 157 of \u00a30.5 billion by 2022 for expected total cash costs of \u00a30.9 billion and non-cash charges of \u00a30.3 billion. The Group has realised substantial cost synergies and expects to exceed thistarget to realise a total of \u00a30.6 billion of annual cost savings. The total cash costs are expectedto be \u00a30.7 billion and non-cash charges are expected to be \u00a30.1 billion, plus additional capitalexpenditure of \u00a30.2 billion. Up to 25 per cent. of the cost savings are intended to be reinvestedin the business to support innovation and other growth opportunities. Restructuring costs and Transaction-related costs incurred by the Group during the period FY 2019 to FY 2021 were largely as a consequence of the Pfizer Transaction. Restructuring costswere primarily attributable to steps taken in connection with the integration of the PfizerContributed CH Business. Restructuring costs and Transaction-related costs are treated asAdjusting Items for the purposes of Adjusted operating profit. Integration and restructuringrelated to the Pfizer Transaction was substantially completed by the end of FY 2021, and theDirectors expect the final charges to occur in FY 2022. 2.13 Divestments As part of the Group's strategy in the periods under review, the Group made a number of divestments in order to bring greater focus to its portfolio of brands. Divestments have anegative impact on revenue growth year-on-year. Operating profit margin is also affected as aresult of gains and/or losses arising from divestments, together with costs incurred inconnection with the divestments. These costs are treated as an Adjusting Item for the purposesof Adjusted operating profit. The Group's programme of disposals realised \u00a31.1 billion in proceeds net of costs and taxes from FY 2019 to FY 2021. The disposal programme had a negative impact on the Group'soperating profit margin as the Group no longer received the associated revenue following thedivestments, but due to the relatively low investment in these brands and the lack of dedicatedresources supporting them, the majority of the costs previously attributed to these brandsremained following their disposal. The sale of ThermaCare and related manufacturing sites, which completed in Q1 2020, was a key divestment in the context of the Group's operations and was made in connection withcertain regulatory conditions imposed on the Group as a result of the Pfizer Transaction.Following the sale, restrictions on the integration of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business werelifted. Other disposals included brands in the Group's Skin Health portfolio. The Group continues to actively manage its portfolio (see paragraph 2.3 of this Part VII (Operating and Financial Review ) above). 2.14 Impact of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of associated responsive measures by governments in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates affected the Group's performancein FY 2020 and FY 2021. Widespread consumer stockpiling in Q1 2020 resulted in an increase in revenue across all of the Group's categories in North America and EMEA. Stockpiling was followed by falls indemand, driven by consumers using up stockpiled supplies, together with fewer consumervisits to pharmacies and retail outlets during government-imposed lockdowns. This negativelyimpacted revenue in Q2 to Q4 of 2020, with the largest impact in Q2. Lockdowns alsoimpacted the market for Denture Care products at certain points during FY 2020 and FY 2021,given the reduced incidence of social occasions. 158 The performance of the Group's Respiratory Health category in FY 2020 and the first half of 2021 was materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue in RespiratoryHealth is typically driven by seasonal demand for certain of the Group's products (seeparagraph 2.9 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) above). However, Government measures imposed in response to COVID-19, such as the widespread use of face masks andimplementation of lockdowns, social distancing measures and improved hygiene practices,lead to a significant reduction in the number of respiratory illnesses, such as the common coldand flu, in the Group's key geographic markets. The introduction of specific restrictions on thesale of cough and cold medicines in China further depressed the Group's revenue (seeparagraph 2.16 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below). Respiratory Health revenue consequently decreased by 1.5 per cent. at AER and increased by 0.5 per cent. atCER from FY 2019 to FY 2020. Whilst revenue grew at CER due to the inclusion of full yearrevenue of the brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction (including Robitussin), thecategory experienced negative organic revenue growth of 6.3 per cent. in FY 2020. In FY2021, while Respiratory Health revenue continued to be adversely impacted in the first half ofthe year, revenue recovered in the second half, as restrictions began to ease and seasonalvirus levels began to return to more normalised levels of respiratory illnesses. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a surge in demand for certain OTC and VMS products, as consumers became concerned with bolstering their immune systems and treating thesymptoms of COVID-19 and side effects of COVID-19 vaccinations. In particular, in FY 2020and FY 2021, an increase in demand for Panadol (a paracetamol-based product) led to growthin the Group's Pain Relief category. This growth in Panadol revenue may also have beenattributable to negative media coverage regarding the use of ibuprofen products in treating thesymptoms of COVID-19, which adversely impacted sales of Advil (an ibuprofen-based product)during FY 2020. In the VMS category, the increasing trend towards self-management of healthand wellbeing, which was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, contributed to increaseddemand for Centrum and Emergen-C during FY 2020 and FY 2021. Among its far-reaching impacts, COVID-19 has also accelerated the convergence of the digital environment and health, including the rapid expansion of e-commerce for consumer healthcareproducts. Sales of the Group's products through the online channel grew from around 4 percent. of revenue in FY 2019 to around 8 per cent. of revenue in FY 2021. In the periods underreview, the Group continued investment in the Group's e-commerce platforms, including inrelation to digital content for online retailer platforms, the direct-to-consumer channel in theUSA (e.g., personalised Chapstick), and tools to measure the performance of the Group's\"digital shelf\" (e.g., presence of imagery, quality of content and shelf availability). Costs associated with the Group's supply chain were also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with increased costs in relation to freight and staffing. Increased staffing costs weredriven by increased demand for the Group's products, the purchase of additional personalprotective equipment, and changes to staff shift patterns in order to accommodate socialdistancing requirements. Further, the Group's shipping costs increased as a result of the globalmacroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 2.15 Foreign exchange The Group operates internationally and holds assets, incurs liabilities, generates sales and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than Pounds Sterling, which is the currency inwhich it reports its consolidated financial results. As a result, the Group's results of operationsare affected by exchange rate fluctuations between Pounds Sterling and other currencies in 159 which it conducts and will continue to conduct transactions, including US Dollar, Euro, Swiss Franc and Chinese Renminbi. For example, the impact of movements in foreign currenciesagainst Pounds Sterling had a negative effect on the Group's results of operations in FY 2021,with a \u00a3443 million unfavourable revenue impact driven primarily by the depreciation of anumber of currencies, including the US Dollar, certain currencies in Latin America, theJapanese Yen, the Turkish Lira, the Euro and the Russian Ruble, in each case against PoundsSterling during that period. As discussed in paragraph 3 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has had an adverse effect on the value of the Russian Ruble, which may negatively impact the Group's operations in Russia, asrevenue from products sold in Russia are incurred in Russian Rubles, while costs associatedwith those products are denominated in other currencies, such as Euro or US Dollars. In order to reduce foreign currency translation exposure, the Group seeks to denominate borrowings in the currencies of its principal assets and cash flows. The Group manages foreigncurrency transactional exposure by selectively hedging exposure arising on external andinternal trade flows. The Group also adopts a natural hedging strategy and, to the extentreasonably possible, seeks to align the currency of inflows and outflows to minimise foreignexchange exposure. In certain cases (such as the purchase of some manufacturing inputs orsome export sales made to distributors in markets where the Group does not have an entitypresence) transactional foreign exchange exposure exists (see paragraph 2.9 of Risk Factors ). 2.16 Regulation The consumer healthcare market is heavily regulated by governments and other regulatory bodies in the countries in which the Group operates. Within the consumer healthcare market,the OTC segment tends to be subject to greater regulation, including in relation to pricing. The Group expends significant resources within SG&A to support compliance with a broad and varied range of regulatory requirements, including pharmacovigilance obligations, maintenanceof product registrations and compliance with rigorous quality standards. The Group is alsosubject to periodic requirements to assess and address new potential risks to consumers, suchas the recent requirement imposed by a number of regulators to assess nitrosamine levels inOTC medicines. Failure to comply with regulations could lead to supply interruptions, productrecalls and/or regulatory enforcement action and fines from regulators. See paragraph 2.1 ofRisk Factors . Changes to the laws and regulations to which the Group and its operations are subject, whether as a result of new or more stringent requirements, or more stringent interpretations ofexisting requirements, can also impose significant compliance costs and impact the way inwhich the Group conducts its business. For example, in China, in early 2020, certain localauthorities introduced temporary restrictions on the sale of certain cough and cold medicines inan attempt to prevent patients from self-medicating against COVID-19 at home, which limitedsales of Contac (nasal decongestant tablets that also relieve pain and reduce a fever) andFenbid (ibuprofen-based pain relief medicine) by the Group in 2020. These restrictions had anadverse impact on the Group's revenue in FY 2020 and FY 2021. Similar restrictions may beimposed in the future, depending on the development of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Group has also been impacted, and expects to continue to be impacted, by recent reforms regarding government price management of drugs in China (see paragraph 9 of Part X(Regulatory Overview )). The nationwide volume-based procurement program, which was introduced in 2018, has negatively impacted revenue in respect of Fenbid sold in the country 160 through the state-owned hospital channel, and other brands may be brought within the scope of this initiative in future. In order to mitigate the impact, the Group is seeking to increase salesthrough retail and e-commerce channels. 2.17 Separation and future restructuring The Group has taken a number of actions in preparation for Separation, including to ensure that the Group has the necessary infrastructure to operate as an independent publicly listedcompany. These actions include the establishment of independent IT infrastructure andindependent corporate functions and governance of the Group, including building keytechnology infrastructure and capability within corporate functions to support a publicly-listedgroup. During FY 2020 and FY 2021, the Group incurred costs in connection with preparation for Separation of \u00a366 million and \u00a3278 million, respectively. The Directors expect the Group toincur Separation and Admission costs of approximately \u00a30.4 billion between 2022 and 2024(including Admission costs of up to \u00a30.1 billion), most of which are expected to be incurred in2022. Following Separation, the Group expects to incur Restructuring costs of approximately \u00a30.2 billion between 2022 and 2024 in connection with projects to support further efficiencies inits operations. The Directors do not currently anticipate further significant restructuringprogrammes. Restructuring costs are treated as an Adjusting Item for the purpose ofcalculating Adjusted operating profit. The Directors also expect the Group to incur recurring operating costs of approximately \u00a3175 million to \u00a3200 million per annum from 2022 onwards to provide the capabilities tooperate successfully as a standalone UK public listed company following Separation, includingin technology and infrastructure, and in corporate functions. The Group has historically benefited from negotiated arrangements with third-party suppliers, distributors, licensors, lessors, other business partners and/or counterparties as part of thelarger GSK Group. While certain of these arrangements will change as a result of Separation,the cost impact is not expected to be material. The Group has entered into a Transition Services Agreement with the GSK Group in connection with Separation. The Transition Services Agreement is short-term and limited inscope (see paragraph 15.14 of Part XII ( Additional Information )). Additionally, the Group has entered into Manufacturing and Supply Agreements with the GSK Group, which are alsolimited in scope (see paragraph 15.15 of Part XII ( Additional Information )). 3. Recent developments The Group is monitoring the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the GSK Board overseeing and monitoring key risks. The Board will assume oversight and management ofthese risks after Separation. The Group's operations and presence in these markets is limitedand Russia and Ukraine accounted for less than 3 per cent. of each of the Group's revenueand Adjusted operating profit in FY 2021. The Group has no manufacturing operations in thesemarkets and imports products sold there. Since the start of the conflict, the Group has beenconstantly evaluating its activities in Russia and has stopped advertising and promotionalactivity in Russia. The Group is prioritising supply of OTC medicines and reducing its oralhealth products, ensuring the Group continues to meet basic consumer health needs. TheGroup is no longer importing food supplements and vitamins into Russia. 161 There is a significant risk to disruption of the Group's operations in Russia and Ukraine. \u0081 Despite the limited scope of the Group's activities in Russia and the Group's focus on meeting consumers' everyday health needs, there may be certain reputational risksassociated with the Group's presence in the Russian market. \u0081 The Group generates revenue from sales of its products in Russia in the Russian Ruble, while significant costs (notably, manufacturing and supply chain costs) associated withthose products are denominated in other currencies, such as Euro and US Dollar. Theinternational response to the invasion, including the imposition of international sanctionsagainst Russia, has had a significant adverse effect on the value of the Russian Ruble,which has reduced the Group's revenue from its operations in Russia without acorresponding reduction in costs, and the Group may not be able to offset the devaluationof the Russian Ruble through increased prices of its products. In addition, the imposition ofexchange controls may limit the Group's ability to repatriate profits from its operations inRussia. \u0081 The Group's ability to supply customers may be negatively affected by disruption to supply and distribution channels. \u0081 The Group's customers in Russia and Ukraine may have been significantly negatively affected by the factors described above, which exposes the Group to increasedcounterparty risk in relation to these customers and receivables from these customers. \u0081 The imposition of sanctions and other restrictive measures against Russia, Russia's response to the global sanctions regime, as well as additional international sanctionsagainst Russia, may create regulatory uncertainty and present further compliancechallenges for the Group's operations, which may increase compliance costs and make itdifficult to continue operations in Russia. \u0081 The Group tested all assets that presented impairment indicators as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in Q1 2022 and recognised write-downs and impairments ofassets representing less than 0.1 per cent. of the Group's total assets as at 31 March 2022in relation to certain brands, finished goods inventory and receivables. Depending on thelong term outlook of the Group's business in Russia and Ukraine, the carrying value ofcertain of the Group's intangible assets may be impacted. However, any such impact is notanticipated to be material to the Group. \u0081 As at the date of the Prospectus, the Russian government has indicated it has drawn up plans to seize the assets of western companies leaving Russia. While the scope of suchmeasures is not presently clear, if the Group ceased its activities and/or suspended itsoperations in Russia and did not resume its presence in Russia within a certain period oftime, the Russian government could: (i) nationalise the Group's assets located in Russia;(ii) allow the Group's patents and trade marks to be used within Russia without the Group'sconsent; and/or (iii) introduce restrictions on, or impose unfavourable terms in respect of,payments made from Russia or relating to assets in Russia. In addition to the specific implications for the Group's operations in Russia and Ukraine, the Group may be affected by broader impacts on th e global geopolitical and economic environment, including (but not limited to) changes in commodity, freight, logistics and input costs. 162 4. Current financial update GSK intends to publish its quarterly and half-yearly results for the three and six months ended 30 June 2022 on 27 July 2022, which will include financial information in relation to the ConsumerHealthcare Segment prepared under IFRS 5 \"Non-current assets held for sale and discontinuedoperations\". The Group also intends to publish an update on trading for the six months ending 30June 2022 on 27 July 2022 and will acknowledge certain financial information published by GSK inrelation to the Consumer Healthcare Segment. The Group intends to publish its half-yearly resultsfor the six months ended 30 June 2022 on 19 September 2022. 4.1 Revenue Revenue for the three months ended 31 March 2022 compared to the three months ended 31 March 2021 The Group's revenue in Q1 2022 and Q1 \u00a32,627 million and \u00a32,306 million, respectively. The Group's revenue increased by 13.9 per cent. at AER and increased by14.4 per cent. at CER during Q1 2022. The Group's organic revenue growth was 15.6 per cent. Revenue growth at AER and CER reflected growth across all regions and categories, and benefitted from favourable prior year comparators especially in Respiratory Health which saw astrong rebound following the historically low cold and flu season in Q1 2021, with cold and flusales contributing approximately five percentage points to total growth. In addition, advanceretailer and wholesaler stock-in, and initial distributor sell-in due to the systems cutover anddistribution business model change ahead of Separation contributed approximately twopercentage points to total growth. Strong sales growth in Pain Relief benefited from increaseddemand during the COVID-19 Omicron wave and an improved capacity in VMS. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by the same factors but excluded a 0.5 per cent. decrease in revenue growth as a result of the net adverse exchange rate movements (includedin AER) and a 1.2 per cent. decrease in revenue growth as a result of the impact ofdivestments and MSAs (included both in AER and CER). 4.2 Revenue by product category The table below sets out the Group's revenue by product category for the three months ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021. Revenue (\u00a3m) Revenue change 2,306 13.9% 14.4% 15.6% (A) Oral Health Revenue in the Oral Health category grew by 5.7 per cent. at AER and 7.9 per cent. at CER. Sensodyne delivered high-single digit per cent. revenue growth reflectingunderlying brand strength, continued innovation and strong growth across key marketsincluding the US, India, Japan, Middle East and Africa. Gum Health delivered high-single digits per cent. revenue growth. Denture Care grew low teens per cent. followingthe decrease of sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. 163 (B) VMS Revenue in the VMS category grew by 16.4 per cent. at AER and 14.8 per cent. at CER. Centrum grew high -teens per cent., with particularly strong growth in China due toconsumer focus on immunity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergen-C grewhigh -thirties per cent. versus a high -twenties per cent. decrease in Q1 2021. Caltraterevenue growth declined low-single digits per cent., with mid-single digit per cent. growthin China being insufficient to offset a decline in the US and South East Asia. (C) Pain Relief Revenue in the Pain Relief category grew by 18.0 per cent. at AER and 18.6 per cent. at CER. Panadol grew low -forties per cent. due to a successful campaign aimed atpost vaccination use and increased demand during the COVID-19 Omicron wave. Advilgrew high -twenties per cent. benefitting from retail stocking patterns in the US versusa decrease in Q1 2021. Excedrin grew high-single digit per cent. and Voltaren wasstable with growth in China offset by a decrease in Germany. (D) Respiratory Health Revenue in the Respiratory Health category grew by 51.0 per cent. at AER and 52.9 per cent. at CER. The category rebounded strongly from the historically lowdemand for cold and flu products in Q1 2021. Cold and flu product sales more thandoubled in the US and were strong in Europe, Middle East and Africa and LatinAmerica, with sales ahead of pre-pandemic levels in 2019. (E) Digestive Health and Other In Digestive Health and Other, revenue grew by 0.6 per cent. at AER and declined by 0.5 per cent. at CER. This was primarily driven by strong revenue growth in Tums andEno partially offset by a low-single digit per cent. decline in Nexium. 4.3 Revenue by region The table below sets out the Group's revenue by region for the quarter ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021. Revenue (\u00a3m) Revenue change Q1 The Group's revenue attributable to North America was \u00a3940 million and \u00a3783 million in Q1 2022 and Q1 respectively. The Group's revenue grew 20.1 per cent. atAER and 16.5 per cent. at CER. Organic revenue growth was 17.3 per cent. Revenue growth at AER and CER was largely driven by mid-fifties per cent. growth in Respiratory Health as a result of strong execution and a rebound following the 164 historically low cold and flu season in Q1 2021, and low-twenties per cent. growth in Pain Relief driven by sales in Advil. VMS also experienced low-twenties per cent.revenue growth, reflecting sales growth of Centrum and Emergen-C. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by the same principal factors but excluded a 3.6 per cent. increase in revenue growth as a result of favourable exchangerate movements (included in AER) and a 0.8 per cent. decrease in revenue growth asa result of the impact of divestments and MSAs (included both in AER and CER). (B) EMEA and LatAm The Group's revenue attributable to EMEA and was \u00a3979 2022 and Q1 2021, respectively. The Group's revenue grew 8.0 percent. at AER and 12.5 per cent. at CER. Organic revenue growth was 14.5 per cent. Revenue growth at AER and CER was largely driven by high-fifties per cent. growth in Respiratory Health, which saw a strong rebound following the historically low cold andflu season in Q1 2021, which led to an increase in consumption of Otrivin, Panadol andTheraflu. In addition, Panadol sales were also supported by a campaign aimed at postvaccination use and increased demand during the COVID-19 Omicron wave. Thisdrove high-single digit per cent. growth in the Pain Relief category and offset a declinein sales of Voltaren. Low-teens per cent. revenue growth in VMS and high-single digitper cent. revenue growth in Oral Health were driven by higher consumption. A sell-inahead of a systems cutover and distribution model change contributed approximately 4percentage points to revenue growth in the region. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by the same principal factors but excluded a 4.5 per cent. decrease in revenue growth as a result of adverse exchangerate movements (included in AER) and a 2.0 per cent. decrease in revenue growth asa result of the impact of divestments and MSAs (included both in AER and CER). (C) APAC The Group's revenue attributable to APAC was \u00a3630 \u00a3544 in Q1 2022 and Q1 2021, respectively. The Group's revenue grew 15.8 per cent. at AER and15.0 per cent. at CER. Organic revenue growth was 15.2 per cent. Revenue growth at AER and CER was largely driven by high-thirties per cent. growth in Pain Relief principally in Australia. Low double-digit per cent. revenue growth in VMSwas driven by continued consumption increases of Centrum in China and South EastAsia. High single-digit per cent. revenue growth in Oral Health was driven by increasedSensodyne consumption, with growth principally coming from China, India, Japan andSouth East Asia. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by the same principal factors but excluded a 0.8 per cent. increase in revenue growth as a result of favourable exchangerate movements (included in AER) and a 0.2 per cent. decrease in revenue growth asa result of the impact of MSAs (included both in AER and CER). 165 4.4 Operating profit and operating profit margin Operating profit and operating profit margin for the three months ended 31 March 2022 compared to the three months ended 31 March 2021 The Group's operating profit was \u00a3466 million in Q1 2022 and \u00a3348 million in Q1 2021, with an operating profit margin of 17.7 per cent. and 15.1 per cent. in each of those periodsrespectively. Adjusted operating profit was \u00a3631 million in Q1 2022 and \u00a3482 million in Q12021, with an Adjusted operating profit margin of 24.0 per cent. and 20.9 per cent. in each ofthose periods respectively. The increase in operating profit and operating profit margin primarily reflected organic revenue growth, strong leverage from volume growth and product price increases, supply chainefficiencies and increases in incremental synergy benefits from the Pfizer Transaction ofapproximately \u00a330 million. This was partially offset by increased commodity and freight costs,increased advertising and promotion investment and approximately \u00a320 million of costsassociated with providing the Group with the capabilities to operate as a standalone UK publiclisted company following Separation. Adjusting Items within operating profit totalled \u00a3165 million and \u00a3134 million in Q1 2022 and Q1 2021 respectively. The \u00a331m increase is driven by an increase in Separation and Admissioncosts and Net amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, partially offset by decreases inrestructuring costs associated with the Pfizer Transaction and other operating income fromdisposal and others. The increases in Adjusted operating profit and Adjusted operating profit margin were driven by the same principal factors affecting operating profit and operating profit margin but excludedthe impact of the increase in Adjusting Items. 4.5 Profit after tax Profit after tax for the three months ended 31 March 2022 compared to the three months ended 31 March 2021 Taking into account net finance costs, which included the impact of the issuance of the Pre-Separation Programme Notes and the Pre-Separation USD Notes, profit after tax was\u00a3357 million in Q1 2022, increasing by \u00a3108 million from \u00a3249 million in Q1 2021. Thisreflected higher operating profit during the period, as described above, and a lower effectivetax rate in Q1 2022. Adjusted profit after tax was \u00a3491 million in Q1 2022, increasing by \u00a3127 million from \u00a3364 million in Q1 2021. This reflected increased Adjusted operating profit during the period,as described above, and a lower Adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 2022, which decreased from25 per cent. in Q1 2021 to 22 per cent. in Q1 2022. 4.6 Non-current assets The Group's non-current assets as at 31 March 2022 and 31 December 2021 were \u00a329,725 million and \u00a329,200 million, respectively. The Group's non-current assets increased by\u00a3525 million, primarily driven by an increase in intangible assets, due to exchange ratefluctuations and the transfer of two local brands from GSK into the JV as part of theSeparation, offset by amortisation. 166 4.7 Current assets The Group's current assets as at 31 March 2022 and 31 December 2021 were \u00a315,298 million and \u00a35,251 million, respectively. The Group's current assets increased by \u00a310,047 million,primarily driven by an increase in loan amounts owing from related parties in connection withthe Notes Proceeds Loans. In addition, trade receivables increased due to higher sales andexchange rate fluctuations. 4.8 Non-current liabilities The Group's non-current liabilities as at 31 March 2022 and 31 December 2021 were \u00a313,148 million and \u00a33,733 million, respectively. The Group's non-current liabilities increasedby \u00a39,415 million, primarily driven by an increase in long-term borrowings, attributable to theissuance of the Pre-Separation Programme Notes and the Pre-Separation USD Notes duringthe period and exchange rate fluctuations. 4.9 Current liabilities The Group's current liabilities as at 31 March 2022 and 31 December 2021 were \u00a35,026 million and \u00a34,238 million, respectively. The Group's current liabilities increased by \u00a3788 million,largely due to higher loan amounts owing to related parties as part of the Group's existingbanking arrangements with GSK finance entities and exchange rate fluctuations. 5. Key performance indicators and non-IFRS financial measures In evaluating the Group's results of operations, the Directors consider the following key performance indicators and non-IFRS financial measures. Further information on the definitionand purpose of these metrics is included at paragraph 6.4 of Presentation of Financial and Other Information . For a reconciliation of non-IFRS financial measures, see paragraph 5 of Part VI ( Selected Financial Information ). 2021 2020 2019 Revenue (\u00a3m) 9,545 9,892 8,480 Revenue growth (%) (3.5) 16.7 -Organic revenue growth (%) 3.8 2.8 -Gross profit (\u00a3m) (%) 1 62.3 gross profit margin 2,172 2,074 1,654Operating profit margin (%) 1 17.2 16.2 10.6 Adjusted operating profit margin (%) 22.8 21.0 19.5Profit after tax Free cash flow (\u00a3m) 1,173 1,988 681Free cash flow conversion (%) 82 168 99 Note 1.

Results of Operations 6.1 Description of the Group's results of operations (A) Revenue Revenue for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 The Group's revenue in FY 2021 and FY 2020 was \u00a39,545 million and \u00a39,892 million, respectively. The Group's revenue decreased by 3.5 per cent. at AER, and increased by 1.0 per cent. at CER reflecting dilution from divestments given the completion of thedivestment programme during FY 2021. The Group's organic revenue growth was3.8 per cent. The decline in revenue at AER reflected adverse exchange rate movements of \u00a3443 million as Pounds Sterling, the Group's reporting currency, strengthened againstother currencies such as the US Dollar, Euro, certain currencies in Latin America, theJapanese Yen, the Turkish Lira and the Russian Ruble. Revenue growth at AER and CER was impacted by a decline attributable to the full year revenue effect of divestments made during the course of FY 2020, includingPhysiogel, Breathe Right, Venoruton and Coldrex, as well of including Transderm Scop, Acne Aid, Baldriparan andSpectraban. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in revenue attributable to brands in the Oral Health, Pain Relief and VMS categories (including Sensodyne,parodontax, Voltaren, Panadol, Excedrin, ENO and brands in the Smokers' Health sub-category ofDigestive Health and Other. This reflects the underlying strength of brands across theGroup's portfolio and categories and continuing growth in e-commerce. The Group delivered revenue growth at CER in the Oral Health, Pain Relief, and VMS categories. Respiratory Health experienced a decline in revenue at CER due to therevenue impact of divestments of brands in that category, as well as the continuedimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated responsive measures, while theDigestive Health and Other category experienced revenue decline at CER due to therevenue impact of divestments of brands in that category. \u0081 In Oral Health, revenue declined by 0.8 per cent. at AER and grew by 4.4 per cent. at CER. Revenue growth at CER was driven by continued strong demand inSensodyne. Sensodyne delivered mid-single digit per cent. revenue growth at CER,which reflected underlying brand strength, continued innovation (for example, the Repair and Protect and Pronamel products), and increased consumption, particularly in India and China. Additionally there was growth in respect of parodontax. Thisgrowth was partially offset by a decline in Aquafresh revenue at CER, which wasattributable to a shift in promotional focus to other brands in the Oral Healthcategory. Denture Care revenue was fla t year-on-year, driven by measures implemented in connection with the COVI D-19 pandemic and increased competition in certain markets, although growth returned in the last quarter of FY 2021. 168 \u0081 Revenue in the VMS category grew by 0.5 per cent. at AER and 3.9 per cent. at CER. Growth at CER built on the significant revenue growth experienced by thecategory in FY 2020. Revenue growth in FY 2021 was primarily attributable to thesustained, double-digit year-on-year per cent. growth in Centrum and mid-singledigit growth in Caltrate, partially offset by a high-single digit per cent. decline inEmergen-C. The strong performance of Centrum reflected the increasingconsumer trend towards self-management of health and wellbeing, particularly inthe APAC region, as well as successful innovation and improved supply capacity inthe US. The decline in Emergen-C revenue was due to a particularly strongcomparator in FY 2020, when Emergen-C revenue increased by half compared toFY 2019 as a result of a surge in demand during the early stages of the COVID-19pandemic. However, Emergen-C revenue in FY 2021 was significantly aboverevenue attributable to the brand in FY 2019. \u0081 Revenue in the Pain Relief category grew by 2.1 per cent. at AER and 6.2 per cent. at CER. Revenue growth at CER was largely due to growth in revenue attributableto Panadol, Voltaren, and Excedrin. Panadol revenue growth at CER in the lowmid-teens was driven by the strength of the brand and an increase in demanddriven by self-medication of symptoms associated with COVID-19 and theCOVID-19 vaccination. Voltaren experienced double-digit per cent. revenue growthat CER, with growth in EMEA and LatAm and APAC partially offset by the impactof the introduction of \"private-label\" products in the US in FY 2021. Excedrinrevenue recovered during FY 2021 following temporary supply chain interruption inFY 2020. Advil revenue was impacted by temporary disruption in third party supply. \u0081 Revenue in the Respiratory Health category declined by 12.8 per cent. at AER and 8.6 per cent. at CER. The decline at CER was primarily attributable to the full yearrevenue impact of the divestment of Breathe Right. While revenue in RespiratoryHealth was adversely impacted by an exceptionally low cold and flu incidence inthe first half of FY 2021, revenue for the category recovered in the second half ofthe year (see paragraph 2.14 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) above). Flonase experienced single -digit per cent. revenue growth year-on-year,driven by a stronger allergy season relative to the prior year comparator. \u0081 In Digestive Health and Other, revenue declined by 9.8 per cent. at AER and 5.0 per cent. at CER. Revenue decline at CER was largely attributable to the fullyear revenue impact of the divestments of Physiogel, Venoruton and Coldrexduring FY 2020. This was partially offset by an increase in revenue attributable toTums, ENO and Chapstick. Tums revenue growth was largely due to growth in themarket for Antacids, improved supply chain capacity, and innovation launches inthe Naturals segment. ENO revenue growth was due to product price increasesand increased consumption. An increase in Chapstick revenue was attributable toincreased in-store purchases, coinciding with the easing of COVID-19 lockdowns. Revenue for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 The Group's revenue in FY 2020 was \u00a39,892 million. The Group's revenue in FY 2019 (including the revenue of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business from 1 August 2019,when it was consolidated) was \u00a38,480 million. Revenue of the Pfizer Contributed CHBusiness for the seven months to 31 July 2019 was \u00a31,523 million. 169 The Group's revenue increased by 16.7 per cent. at AER and 19.3 per cent. at CER, and the Group's organic revenue growth was 2.8 per cent. Revenue growth at AER and CER was primarily driven by the inclusion of the full year of revenue of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business in FY 2020, compared to five monthsof revenue in FY 2019, together with growth in revenue attributable to Sensodyne,Voltaren and Panadol. Revenue growth at AER and CER was partially offset by adecline in revenue attributable to divestments made during the course of FY 2020,including Physiogel, Breathe Right, Venoruton, Oilatum and Coldrex. Growth inrevenue at AER was further offset by adverse exchange rate movements as PoundsSterling, the Group's presentation currency, strengthened against other currenciessuch as the US Dollar, certain currencies in Latin America, the South African Rand andthe Russian Ruble. Organic revenue growth was primarily attributable to growth in organic revenue across the Group's VMS, Pain Relief and Oral Health categories (including in respect ofSensodyne, Centrum, Voltaren and Panadol). Revenue growth in the VMS and PainRelief categories was stronger in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 July 2020 as a resultof increased demand for products during the COVID-19 pandemic designed to addressfever symptoms, together with the impact of consumer stockpiling (described furtherbelow). Organic revenue for the period excludes revenue attributable to brandsacquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 July 2020(see paragraph 6.3 of Presentation of Financial and Other Information ), which made a significant contribution to the Group's revenue in the VMS and Pain Relief categoriesduring the period, with the effect that the overall revenue growth of the Group wasreduced on an organic basis. Furthermore, brands divested in FY 2021 (notablyTransderm Scop in the Digestive Health and Other category, in respect of whichrevenue declined due to competition from generic products) are included in organicrevenue growth for the period FY 2019 to FY 2020, and this also had a significantimpact on the organic growth measure in this period. The Group delivered strong revenue growth at CER in the VMS and Pain Relief categories, single-digit growth in the Oral Health and Digestive Health and Othercategories, and flat revenue growth in Respiratory Health. \u0081 In Oral Health, revenue grew by 3.3 per cent. at AER and 5.9 per cent. at CER. Growth at CER was driven by strong demand in Sensodyne, as well as growth inrespect of parodontax, largely offset by a decline in Aquafresh revenue and revenueattributable to brands in the Denture Care sub-category of Oral Health, the latter ofwhich was driven by fewer opportunities for social occasions during the COVID-19pandemic (see paragraph 2.14 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) above). \u0081 In the VMS category, revenue grew by 150. 3 per cent. at AER and 154.6 per cent. at CER. Growth at CER was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full yearrevenue of brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction (including Centrum,Caltrate and Emergen-C), together with an inc reasing consumer trend towards self- management of health and wellbeing, which was accelerated by the COVID-19pandemic. The Group also increased advertising and promotion investment in theVMS category. 170 \u0081 Revenue grew by 25.8 per cent. at AER and 28.6 per cent. at CER in the Pain Relief category. Growth at CER was largely attributable to the inclusion of the fullyear of revenue of brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction (includingAdvil), together with the Rx-to-OTC switch of Voltaren and a strong performancefrom Panadol. Advil revenue was adversely affected by negative media coverageregarding the use of ibuprofen products in treating the symptoms of COVID-19(see paragraph 2.3 of this Part VII (Operating and Financial Review ) above). Excedrin revenue in North America was affected by temporary supply chaininterruption. \u0081 In Respiratory Health, revenue decreased by 1.5 per cent. at AER and was flat at CER. Flat revenue at CER was primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full yearof revenue attributable to brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction(including Robitussin). This was largely offset by a decline in revenue attributableto Otrivin and Theraflu, which were negatively impacted by the COVID-19pandemic, as well as the impact of the divestment of certain brands in thiscategory. In particular, there was an exceptionally weak cold, cough and flu seasonin Q3 and Q4 of 2020 as a result of measures taken in response to COVID-19,together with fewer consumer visits to stores following the implementation oflockdowns. \u0081 In Digestive Health and Other, revenue decreased by 0.1 per cent. at AER and increased by 2.5 per cent. at CER. Growth at CER was largely attributable to theinclusion of a full year of revenue attributable to brands acquired as part of thePfizer Transaction (including Preparation H and Chapstick). This was partiallyoffset by a decrease in revenue attributable to Fenistil and Abreva, driven by fewerconsumer visits to stores following the implementation of lockdowns during theCOVID-19 pandemic. These factors also negatively impacted Preparation H andChapstick revenue. Further, revenue was negatively impacted as a result of thedivestment of certain brands. (B) Cost of sales Cost of sales for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 The Group's cost of sales was \u00a33,595 million and \u00a33,982 million in FY 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. The Group's cost of sales decreased by 9.7 per cent. (\u00a3387million). This decrease reflects a reduction in Adjusting Items (as outlined below), thefull year impact of divestments in FY 2020 and further integration savings driven by thePfizer Transaction, which more than offset investment in supply chain to improvecontinuity and capacity, as well as inflationary pressures, principally in relation tocommodity and freight costs. Adjusting Items within costs of sales totalled \u00a352 million in FY 2021, which predominantly related to costs of restructuring programmes, together with Netimpairment and amortisation of intangible assets across a number of the Group'sbrands. Adjusting Items within costs of sales totalled \u00a3263 million in FY 2020. Thedecrease primarily reflected reduced costs relating to the Pfizer Transaction (mainlyTransaction-related costs and Restructuring costs), as well as reduced Netamortisation and impairment of intangible assets across a number of the Group'sbrands. 171 Adjusted cost of sales was \u00a33,543 million and \u00a33,719 million in FY 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. Adjusted cost of sales decreased by 4.7 per cent. (\u00a3176 million). This wasprimarily driven by the full year impact on cost of sales of divestments made in FY2020 and further synergies from the Pfizer Transaction, which more than offsetincreased investment in supply chain, inflationary pressures and the increase in salesand freight costs in each region due to disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue reduced to 37.7 per cent. from 40.3 per cent. in FY 2020, largely driven by the reduction in Adjusting Items, further synergies fromthe Pfizer Transaction, product price increases and supply chain efficiencies. This waspartially offset by increased investment in supply chain and increases in freight,commodities and other costs (for example, employee costs), which reflectedinflationary pressures in the supply chain. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage ofrevenue reduced to 37.1 per cent. in FY 2021 from 37.6 per cent. in FY 2020. Cost of sales for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 The Group's cost of sales in FY 2020 was \u00a33,982 million. The Group's cost of sales in FY 2019 (including the cost of sales of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business from1 August 2019, when it was consolidated) was \u00a33,678 million. Cost of sales of thePfizer Contributed CH Business for the seven months to 31 July 2019 was\u00a3570 million. The Group's cost of sales increased by 8.3 per cent. (\u00a3304 million). This increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of the full year of cost of sales of the Pfizer ContributedCH Business in FY 2020, compared to five months in FY 2019, partially offset by areduction in Adjusting Items (as outlined below), as well as the impact of divestmentsand ongoing supply chain productivity efforts. Adjusting Items within costs of sales totalled \u00a3263 million in FY 2020, which predominantly related to further Adjusting Items associated with the Pfizer Transaction(mainly Transaction-related costs and Restructuring costs), together with Netamortisation and impairment of intangible assets across a number of Group's brands.Adjusting Items within cost of sales totalled \u00a3471 million in FY 2019. These AdjustingItems principally related to the Pfizer Transaction (mainly Transaction-related costs andRestructuring costs). Adjusted cost of sales was \u00a33,719 million and \u00a33,207 million in FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively. Adjusted cost of sales increased by 16.0 per cent. (\u00a3512 million), primarilydriven by the inclusion of the full year of Adjusted cost of sales of the PfizerContributed CH Business in FY 2020, compared to five months in FY 2019. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue reduced to 40.3 per cent. in FY 2020 from 43.4 per cent. in FY 2019, largely driven by a reduction in Transaction-related costs,product price increases, improvements in brand mix, synergies and ongoing supplychain productivity efforts. These factors were partially offset by increased freight andstaffing costs driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted cost of sales as apercentage of revenue reduced to 37.6 per cent. in FY 2020 from 37.8 per cent. in FY2019. 172 (C) Gross profit Gross profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 The Group's gross profit in FY 2021 was \u00a35,950 million, producing a gross profit margin of 62.3 per cent. The Group's gross profit in FY 2020 was \u00a35,910 million,producing a gross profit margin of 59.7 per cent. The Group's gross profit increased by 0.7 per cent. (\u00a340 million) in FY 2021, which primarily reflected a reduction in Adjusting Items within cost of sales associated withthe Pfizer Transaction (mainly Transaction-related costs and Restructuring costs). Thismore than offset the year-on-year decline in the Group's revenue at AER. Gross profitmargin increased by 2.6 percentage points, largely reflecting the reduction in theseAdjusting Items associated with the Pfizer Transaction, as well as product priceincreases, improvements in brand mix (including the divestment of several brands) andsynergies from the Pfizer Transaction, as well as other ongoing supply chain andmanufacturing efficiency efforts. These factors were partially offset by investment in thesupply chain, as well as increased freight costs, commodity prices and staffing costsarising in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted gross profit was \u00a36,002 million and \u00a36,173 million in FY 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. Adjusted gross profit decreased by 2.8 per cent. (\u00a3171 million), broadly inline with the year-on-year decline in the Group's revenue at AER. Adjusted gross profit margin for the Group was 62.9 per cent. and 62.4 per cent. for FY 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. The factors driving the year-on-year increase of 0.5percentage points were the same as for gross profit margin, except in respect ofchanges in Adjusting Items, which are excluded from Adjusted gross profit margin. Gross profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 The Group's gross profit was \u00a35,910 million in FY 2020, producing a gross profit margin of 59.7 per cent. The Group's gross profit for FY 2019 (including the gross profitof the Pfizer Contributed CH Business from 1 August 2019, when it was consolidated)was \u00a34,802 million, producing a gross profit margin of 56.6 per cent. Gross profit of thePfizer Contributed CH Business for the seven months to 31 July 2019 was\u00a3953 million, with a gross profit margin of 62.6 per cent. The Group's gross profit increased by 23.1 per cent. (\u00a31,108 million), primarily driven by the inclusion of the full year of gross profit of brands acquired as part of the PfizerTransaction in FY 2020, compared to five months of gross profit in FY 2019. Grossprofit margin increased by 3.1 percentage points from FY 2019 to FY 2020. Thisincrease was largely driven by a reduction in Adjusting Items in relation to the PfizerTransaction (mainly Transaction-related costs and Restructuring costs), product priceincreases, improvements in brand mix, synergies resulting from the Pfizer Transaction,and ongoing supply chain productivity efforts. These factors were partially offset byincreased freight and staffing costs arising as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted gross profit was \u00a36,173 million and \u00a35,273 million in FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively. Adjusted gross profit increased by 17.1 per cent. (\u00a3900 million), primarily 173 driven by the inclusion of the full year of gross profit of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business in FY 2020, compared to five months in FY 2019. Adjusted gross profit margin for the Group was 62.4 per cent. and 62.2 per cent. for FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively. The factors driving the year-on-year increase of 0.2percentage points were the same as for gross profit margin, save in respect of changesin Adjusting Items, which are excluded from Adjusted gross profit margin. (D) Selling, general and administration (\" SG&A \") SG&A costs for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 The Group's SG&A costs were \u00a34,086 million and \u00a34,220 million 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. The Group's SG&A by 3.2 per cent. (\u00a3134 million)in FY 2021, primarily driven by the continued benefit of synergies from the PfizerTransaction and the tight control of ongoing costs, partially offset by an increase inAdjusting Items, primarily in respect of Separation and Admission costs. Adjusting Items within SG&A totalled \u00a3504 million in FY 2021. These principally related to Separation and Admission costs as well as further Restructuring costs associatedwith the Pfizer Transaction. Adjusting Items within SG&A totalled \u00a3401 million in FY2020. These principally related to Restructuring costs associated with the PfizerTransaction, as well as the initial costs in connection with Separation and Admission. Adjusted SG&A costs were \u00a33,582 million and \u00a33,819 million in FY 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. Adjusted SG&A costs decreased by 6.2 per cent. (\u00a3237 million). Thisprimarily reflected the continuing benefit of synergies from the Pfizer Transaction andtight control of ongoing costs. SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue increased to 42.8 per cent. in FY 2021 from 42.7 per cent. in FY 2020. This primarily reflected the impact of an increase inAdjusting Items, in particular costs related to the Pfizer Transaction and in connectionwith Separation and Admission. This was partially mitigated by synergies from thePfizer Transaction and tight cost control. While the Group decreased advertising andpromotion investment in the Respiratory Health category in response to reduceddemand resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associatedresponsive measures (see paragraph 2.14 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) above), investment was redirected to the VMS and Pain Relief categories. Adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased to 37.5 per cent. in FY2021 from 38.6 per cent. in FY 2020. SG&A costs for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 The Group's SG&A costs in FY 2020 were \u00a34,220 million. The Group's SG&A costs in FY 2019 (including the SG&A costs of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business from1 August 2019, when it was consolidated) were \u00a33,596 million. SG&A costs of thePfizer Contributed CH Business for the seven months to 31 July 2019 were\u00a3630 million. 174 The Group's SG&A costs increased by 17.4 per cent. (\u00a3624 million), primarily driven by the inclusion of the full year of SG&A costs of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business inFY 2020, compared to five months in FY 2019, as well as an increase in AdjustingItems (as outlined below), partially offset by synergy savings following the PfizerTransaction and cost control. Adjusting Items within SG&A totalled \u00a3401 million in FY 2020. These principally related to further Restructuring costs associated with the Pfizer Transaction, as well as theinitial costs in connection with the Separation and Admission. Adjusting Items withinSG&A costs totalled \u00a3244 million in FY 2019. These principally related to Restructuringcosts arising from the Pfizer Transaction. Adjusted SG&A costs were \u00a33,819 million and \u00a33,352 million in FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively. Adjusted SG&A costs increased by 13.9 per cent. (\u00a3467 million), primarilydriven by the inclusion of the full year of Adjusted SG&A costs of the Pfizer ContributedCH Business in FY 2020, compared to five months in FY 2019. SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue increased to 42.7 per cent. in FY 2020 from 42.4 per cent. in FY 2019. This reflected an increase in Adjusting Items, partially offsetby synergies resulting from the Pfizer Transaction and cost control, in each case asreferred to above. At a category level, the Group increased advertising and promotioninvestment in the VMS and Pain Relief Categories. In respect of the latter, this was inpart to support the OTC launch of Voltaren and Advil Dual Action in North America (seeparagraph 2.4 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) above). This increase in advertising and promotion spend in the VMS and Pain Relief categories was in turnpartially offset by decreased investment in certain brands in the Group's portfolio wherethe COVID-19 pandemic had a temporary negative impact on demand for certain of theGroup's products. Adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased to38.6 per cent. in FY 2020 from 39.5 per cent. in FY 2019. (E) Research and development (\" R&D \") R&D costs for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 The Group's R&D costs were \u00a3257 million and \u00a3304 million in FY 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. The Group's R&D costs decreased by 15.5 per cent. (\u00a347 million) in FY2021, which primarily reflected continuing Pfizer synergies (including in relation torationalisation of the site footprint and de-duplication of certain functions) and adecrease in Adjusting Items, partially offset by costs associated with an increasedfocus on innovation at a regional level. Adjusting Items within R&D costs totalled \u00a39 million in FY 2021. These primarily related to Net impairment and amortisation of intangible assets. Adjusting Items within R&Dcosts totalled \u00a324 million in FY 2020. These principally related to Net amortisation andimpairment of intangible assets, in addition to Restructuring costs associated with thePfizer Transaction. Adjusted R&D costs were \u00a3248 million and \u00a3280 million in FY 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. Adjusted R&D costs decreased by 11.4 per cent. (\u00a332 million), primarilydriven by Pfizer synergies, and partially offset by costs associated with an increasedfocus on local innovation at a regional level. 175 R&D costs as a percentage of revenue decreased to 2.7 per cent. in FY 2021 from 3.1 per cent. in FY 2020. This reflected the full year benefit of the Pfizer synergies andreduced Restructuring costs. Adjusted R&D costs as a percentage of revenuedecreased to 2.6 per cent. in FY 2021 from 2.8 per cent. in FY 2020. R&D costs for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 The Group's R&D costs in FY 2020 were \u00a3304 million. The Group's R&D costs in FY 2019 (including the R&D costs of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business from 1 August2019, when it was consolidated) were \u00a3292 million. R&D costs of the PfizerContributed CH Business for the seven months to 31 July 2019 were \u00a367 million. The Group's R&D costs increased by 4.1 per cent. (\u00a312 million), primarily driven by the inclusion of the full year of R&D costs of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business in FY2020, compared to five months in FY 2019, partially offset by headcount reduction andoptimisation of the Group's R&D operations, which included laboratory closures inWarren (New Jersey, USA) and Barnard Castle (UK). Adjusting Items within R&D costs totalled \u00a324 million in FY 2020. These primarily related to Net amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, in addition to furtherRestructuring costs associated with the Pfizer Transaction. Adjusting Items within R&Dcosts totalled \u00a325 million in FY 2019. These principally related to Restructuring costs inconnection with the Pfizer Transaction. Adjusted R&D costs were \u00a3280 million and \u00a3267 million in FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively. Adjusted R&D costs increased by 4.9 per cent. (\u00a313 million), primarilydriven by the inclusion of a full year of Adjusted R&D costs of the Pfizer ContributedCH Business, partly offset by headcount reduction and optimisation of the Group'sR&D operations, which included laboratory closures in Warren (New Jersey, USA) andBarnard Castle (UK). R&D costs as a percentage of revenue decreased to 3.1 per cent. in FY 2020 from 3.4 per cent. in FY 2019. This reflected headcount reduction and optimisation of theGroup's R&D operations, as referred to above. Adjusted R&D costs as a percentage ofrevenue decreased to 2.8 per cent. in FY 2020 from 3.1 per cent. in FY 2019. (F) Other operating (expense)/income Other operating income of \u00a331 million in FY 2021 primarily reflected the net gain on disposal of Transderm Scop, Acne-Aid, Spectraban and Baldriparan. Other operating income of \u00a3212 million in FY 2020 primarily reflected the net gain on the sale of a number of brands of the Group, including ThermaCare, Breathe Right,Physiogel, Coldrex, Venoruton and Oilatum. Other operating expenses of \u00a317 million in FY 2019 predominantly related to transaction costs incurred in connection with the disposal of ThermaCare. Transactioncosts in relation to the disposal of certain other businesses and assets of the Groupalso contributed to operating expenses in FY 2019. 176 (G) Operating profit and operating profit margin Operating profit and operating profit margin for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 The Group's operating profit in FY 2021 was \u00a31,638 million, producing an operating profit margin of 17.2 per cent. The Group's operating profit in FY 2020 was\u00a31,598 million, producing an operating profit margin of 16.2 per cent. The Group's operating profit increased by 2.5 per cent. (\u00a340 million) in FY 2021, primarily reflecting organic revenue growth, a reduction in Adjusting Items and tightcost control, largely offset by the impact of divestments during FY 2021 and FY 2020,increased advertising and promotion investment, and increased commodity and freightcosts. Operating profit margin increased by 1.0 percentage point, primarily driven bythe benefit of a full year of Pfizer synergies, product price increases, product andpricing mix and tight cost control, which more than offset the increased advertising andpromotion investment, increased commodity and freight costs, and investment inmanufacturing sites. Adjusting Items within operating profit totalled \u00a3534 million in FY 2021, which represented costs totalling \u00a3565 million in relation to Restructuring costs associatedwith the Pfizer Transaction, Separation and Admission costs and Net impairment andamortisation of intangible assets, offset by income from divestments of \u00a331 million.Adjusting Items within operating profit totalled \u00a3476 million in FY 2020, whichrepresented \u00a3688 million in relation to Transaction-related costs and Restructuringcosts associated with the Pfizer Transaction and Separation and Admission costs, aswell as Net impairment and amortisation of intangible assets, partially offset by incomefrom divestments of \u00a3212 million. Adjusted operating profit was \u00a32,172 million and \u00a32,074 million in FY 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. Adjusted operating profit increased by 4.7 per cent. (\u00a398 million),primarily reflecting organic revenue growth, reductions in SG&A costs and R&D costsresulting from synergies resulting from the Pfizer Transaction, increased gross profitmargins and tight cost control, partially offset by increased advertising and promotioninvestment and increased commodity and freight costs. The Group's Adjusted operating profit margin was 22.8 per cent. and 21.0 per cent. in FY 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. Adjusted operating profit margin increased by 1.8percentage points. The principal factors affecting Adjusted operating profit margin werethe same as for operating profit margin. Operating profit and operating profit margin for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 The Group's operating profit in FY 2020 was \u00a31,598 million, producing an operating profit margin of 16.2 per cent. The Group's operating profit for FY 2019 (including theoperating profit of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business from 1 August 2019, when it wasconsolidated) was \u00a3897 million, producing an operating profit margin of 10.6 per cent.Operating profit of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business for the seven months to 31 July2019 was \u00a3257 million, with an operating profit margin of 16.8 per cent. 177 The Group's operating profit increased by 78.1 per cent. (\u00a3701 million), primarily driven by the inclusion of the full year of operating profit of brands acquired as part of thePfizer Transaction in FY 2020, compared to five months of operating profit in FY 2019,together with related synergies, a net reduction in Adjusting Items in relation to cost ofsales, R&D and SG&A as described above (mainly related to the Pfizer Transaction)and other operating income from the sale of brands. Operating profit margin increasedby 5.6 percentage points from FY 2019 to FY 2020. This increase was primarily drivenby synergies resulting from the Pfizer Transaction, as well as business growth andproduct pricing and mix, partially offset by the full year impact of the brands acquiredas part of the Pfizer Transaction (albeit reduced as a result of cost controlsimplemented by the Group), the impact of divestitures and additional supply chaincosts. Operating profit margin was also affected by changes in Adjusting Items. Adjusting Items within operating profit totalled \u00a3476 million in FY 2020, which represented Transaction costs, Restructuring costs associated with the PfizerTransaction and Separation and Admission costs, as well as Net impairment andamortisation of intangible assets, partially offset by income from divestments of\u00a3212 million. Adjusting Items within operating profit totalled \u00a3757 million in FY 2019,which mainly reflected costs totalling \u00a3696 million in relation to Restructuring costs andTransaction-related costs associated with the Pfizer Transaction. Adjusted operating profit was \u00a32,074 million and \u00a31,654 million in FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively. Adjusted operating profit increased by 25.4 per cent. (\u00a3420 million).As above, this principally reflected the inclusion of the full year of operating profit ofbrands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction in FY 2020, compared to five monthsof operating profit in FY 2019, together with related synergies, combined with businessgrowth and tight cost control, partially offset by the impact of divestments. TheAdjusting Items in respect of operating profit are described in paragraphs 6.1(B) to6.1(E) of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) above. The Group's Adjusted operating profit margin was 21.0 per cent. and 19.5 per cent. in FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively. Adjusted operating profit margin increased by 1.5percentage points. The factors affecting Adjusted operating profit margin were thesame as for operating profit margin, except in respect of changes in Adjusting Items,which are excluded from Adjusted operating profit margin. (H) Net finance costs Net finance costs for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 Net finance costs on both an IFRS and Adjusted basis reduced to \u00a32 million in FY 2021 from \u00a37 million in FY 2020, primarily due to a decrease in payable balances withfinance entities in the GSK Group and other loans. There were no Adjusting Items that affected Net finance costs in FY 2021 and FY 2020. Net finance costs for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 Net finance costs on both an IFRS and Adjusted basis reduced to \u00a37 million in FY 2020 from \u00a311 million in FY 2019, primarily attributable to the revaluation of derivatives andfinancial instruments. 178 There were no Adjusting Items that affected Net finance costs in FY 2020 and FY 2019. (I) Profit before tax Profit before tax for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 Taking into account net finance costs, profit before tax was \u00a31,636 million in FY 2021, increasing by \u00a345 million from \u00a31,591 million in FY 2020. This reflected increasedoperating profit during the period, as described above. Adjusted profit before tax was \u00a32,170 million in FY 2021, increasing by \u00a3103 million from \u00a32,067 million in FY 2020. This reflected increased Adjusted operating profitduring the period, as described above. Profit before tax for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 Taking into account net finance costs, profit before tax was \u00a31,591 million in FY 2020, increasing by \u00a3705 million from \u00a3886 million in FY 2019. This reflected increasedoperating profit during the period, as described above. Adjusted profit before tax was \u00a32,067 million in FY 2020, increasing by \u00a3424 million from \u00a31,643 million in FY 2019. This reflected increased Adjusted operating profitduring the period, as described above. (J) Income tax and effective tax rate In FY 2021, the corporate tax charge was \u00a3197 million on profit before tax of \u00a31,636 million. The IFRS effective tax rate was 12.0 per cent, which reflected theimpacts of the applicable tax treatment on Adjusting Items. Permanent differences ondisposals, acquisitions and transfers including tax credits relating to an uplift in the taxbasis of certain brands transferred intragroup resulted in a reduction of the IFRSeffective rate. The Adjusted effective tax rate of 21.6 per cent. was higher than the UKstatutory rate of 19.0 per cent. due to profit generated in jurisdictions with higher taxrates (such as the USA and China), tax losses not recognised, and changes in taxrates in certain jurisdictions, partially offset by the benefits of tax rulings in territoriessuch as Switzerland and Puerto Rico, the availability of R&D credit, re-assessments ofprior year estimates and other permanent differences. In FY 2020, the corporate tax charge was \u00a3410 million on profit before tax of \u00a31,591 million. The IFRS effective tax rate was 25.8 per cent, which reflected theimpacts of the applicable tax treatment on Adjusting Items, and was also adverselyimpacted by revaluing the rates applicable to various deferred tax balances. TheAdjusted effective tax rate of 23.4 per cent. was higher than the UK statutory rate of19.0 per cent. due to profit generated in jurisdictions with higher tax rates (such as theUSA and China), partially offset by the benefits of tax rulings in territories such asSwitzerland and Puerto Rico, the availability of R&D credit, re-assessment of prior yearestimates and other permanent differences. 179 In FY 2019, the corporate tax charge was \u00a3199 million on profit before tax of \u00a3886 million. The IFRS effective tax rate was 22.5 per cent., which reflected theimpacts of the applicable tax treatment on Adjusting Items. The Adjusted effective taxrate of 22.2 per cent. was higher than the UK statutory rate of 19.0 per cent. due toprofit generated in jurisdictions with higher tax rates (such as the USA, Italy andChina), partially offset by the benefits of tax rulings in territories such as Switzerlandand Puerto Rico, the availability of R&D credits and other non-taxable items. (K) Profit after tax Profit after tax for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 Profit after tax was \u00a31,439 million in FY 2021, increasing by \u00a3258 million from \u00a31,181 million in FY 2020. This reflected the reduced effective tax rate and tax chargein FY 2021, as well as increased operating profit during the period, as describedabove. Adjusted profit after tax was \u00a31,701 million in FY 2021, increasing by \u00a3117 million from \u00a31,584 million in FY 2020. This reflected the reduced effective tax rate and tax chargein FY 2021, as well as increased Adjusted operating profit during the period, asdescribed above. Profit after tax for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 Profit after tax was \u00a31,181 million in FY 2020, increasing by \u00a3494 million from \u00a3687 million in FY 2019. This reflected increased operating profit during the period, asdescribed above, partially offset by an increased effective tax rate and tax charge in FY2020. Adjusted profit after tax was \u00a31,584 million in FY 2020, increasing by \u00a3306 million from \u00a31,278 million in FY 2019. This reflected increased Adjusted operating profit during theperiod, as described above, partially offset by the increased Adjusted effective tax rateand tax charge in FY 2020. (L) Profit attributable to non-controlling interests Profit attributable to non-controlling interests for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 Profit attributable to non-controlling interests in FY 2021 was \u00a349 million, increasing by \u00a313 million from \u00a336 million in FY 2020. Adjusted profit attributable to non-controllinginterests in FY 2021 was \u00a349 million, increasing by \u00a311 million from \u00a338 million in FY2020. These increases reflect reduced Adjusted effective tax rate and tax charge in FY2021, in addition to higher Adjusted operating profit during the period, as describedabove. There were no Adjusting Items that affected non-controlling interests in FY 2021, as compared to \u00a32 million in FY 2020 (as described below). 180 Profit attributable to non-controlling interests for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 Profit attributable to non-controlling interests in FY 2020 was \u00a336 million, increasing by \u00a34 million from \u00a332 million in FY 2019. Adjusted profit attributable to non-controllinginterests in FY 2020 was \u00a338 million, increasing by \u00a36 million from \u00a332 million in FY2019. These increases reflect higher Adjusted operating profit during the period, asdescribed above, partially offset by the increased Adjusted effective tax rate and taxcharge in FY 2020. Adjusting Items attributable to non-controlling interests totalled \u00a32 million in FY 2020. These principally related to costs incurred in relation to restructuring programmes inrespect of certain Group subsidiaries with non-controlling interests. (M) Earnings per share (\" EPS \") Earnings per share for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 In FY 2021, Basic EPS and Diluted EPS were both 139,000p. On an Adjusted basis, these were 165,200p. In FY 2020, Basic EPS and Diluted EPS were both 114,500p.On an Adjusted basis, these were 154,600p. The year-on-year increase reflectedincreased profit after tax during the period, as described above. The number of shares in issue used to calculate these amounts may not be representative of the number of shares in issue in the future. Earnings per share for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 In FY 2020, Basic EPS and Diluted EPS were both 114,500p. On an Adjusted basis, these were 154,600p. In FY 2019, Basic EPS and Diluted EPS were both 65,500p. Onan Adjusted basis, these were 124,600p. The year-on-year increase reflectedincreased profit after tax during the period, as described above. The number of shares in issue used to calculate these amounts may not be representative of the number of shares in issue in the future. (N) Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 The Group's Adjusted EBITDA was \u00a32,413 million and \u00a32,351 million in 2021 and FY 2020 respectively. The Group's Adjusted EBITDA increased by 2.6 per cent. (\u00a362 million), primarily driven by the increase in the Adjusted operating profit during the period, as described above,partially offset by a net decrease in depreciation and amortisation. 181 Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 The Group's Adjusted EBITDA was \u00a32,351 million in FY 2020. The Group's Adjusted EBITDA in FY 2019 (including the Adjusted EBITDA of the Pfizer Contributed CHBusiness from 1 August 2019, when it was consolidated) was \u00a31,884 million. The Group's Adjusted EBITDA increased by 24.8 per cent. (\u00a3467 million), primarily driven by the inclusion of the full year of profit of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business inFY 2020, compared to five months in FY 2019. The remaining growth largely resultedfrom synergies arising from the Pfizer Transaction and an increase in depreciation andamortisation, partially offset by increased supply chain costs arising as a result of theCOVID-19 pandemic. 6.2 Regional performance (A) Regional performance for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to 31 December 2020 (i) North America (a) Revenue The Group's revenue attributable to North America was \u00a33,525 million and \u00a33,779 million in FY 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. The Group's revenue declined 6.7 per cent. at AER, and 1.3 per cent. at CER.Organic revenue growth in North America was 1.3 per cent. for the period FY 2020 to FY 2021. This principally reflected growth across the Oral Health, PainRelief and Digestive Health categories, partially offset by a decline in revenuein the VMS and Respiratory Health categories. The decline in revenue at AER and CER was primarily driven by the full year revenue impact of divestments made in FY 2020, principally the divestment ofBreathe Right, ThermaCare, Dimetapp and Anbesol. This was compounded bya further decline in Respiratory Health revenue as compared to FY 2020,driven by an exceptionally low incidence of cold and flu in the first half of FY2021 (see paragraph 2.14 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) above). Revenue at AER was further impacted by adverse currency exchangemovements of \u00a3204 million as Pounds Sterling strengthened against theUS Dollar. These negative trends were partially offset by continued growth inSensodyne, Tums, Centrum and Flonase revenue and recovery in Excedrinrevenue following supply chain disruption in FY 2020. The decline in revenue at CER was attributable to several factors across the categories in which the Group operates: \u0081 Mid-single digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the Oral Health category was primarily driven by Sensodyne, which reflected the strengthof the brand in the USA, continued innovation and product price increases. 182 Increased demand for parodontax also contributed to growth in Oral Health. Revenue in respect of brands in the Denture Care sub-categorydeclined due to increased competition. \u0081 There was a low-single digit per cent. revenue decline at CER in the VMS category driven by reduced demand for Emergen-C, partially offset bygrowth in Centrum. Emergen-C revenue decreased, relative to aparticularly strong comparator in FY 2020, when Emergen-C experienced asurge in demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The continuedgrowth in Centrum revenue reflected the continued consumer trendtowards self-management of health and wellbeing, as well as successfulinnovation and improved supply capacity in the US. \u0081 Mid-single digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the Pain Relief category was mainly driven by a recovery in Excedrin following supplychain interruption in FY 2020. This was partially offset by revenue declinein Advil due to the impact of temporary disruption in third party supply.Voltaren revenue declined due to increased competition from \"private-label\" Diclofenac products, which was in line with expectations (seeparagraph 2.4 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review )). \u0081 In the Respiratory Health category, a mid-teens per cent. revenue decline at CER was mainly attributable to a decline in Robitussin and Theraflurevenue, driven by exceptionally low cold and flu incidence, together withthe full year revenue impact of the divestment of Breathe Right and othercold and flu brands in FY 2020. This was partially offset by increaseddemand for Flonase, driven by a stronger allergy season relative to theprior year comparator. \u0081 In Digestive Health and Other, the low-single digit per cent. revenue decline at CER was primarily attributable to the full year impact of thedivestments of ThermaCare, Dimetapp and Anbesol in FY 2020, as well asa decline in Preparation H revenue, in part due to a temporary supply chaindisruption. Chapstick revenue started to recover after being negativelyimpacted by fewer consumer visits to stores in FY 2020 during the earlierstages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue attributable to Tumscontinued to grow, driven by an increase in the size of the Antacids market. (b) Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit for the North America region in FY 2021 was \u00a3828 million, producing an Adjusted operating profit margin of 23.5 per cent.Adjusted operating profit for the North America region in FY 2020 was\u00a3897 million, producing an Adjusted operating profit margin of 23.7 per cent.The year-on-year decrease in Adjusted operating profit margin of 0.2percentage points reflected a number of factors, including investment in brandsin the VMS and Pain Relief categories and inflationary pressures (suchincreased commodity prices, supply chain costs and payroll), partially offset by: \u0081 synergies resulting from the Pfizer Transaction;\u0081 continued lower levels of travel, meeting and other expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 183 \u0081 net savings in advertising and promotion spend as a percentage of revenue, resulting from the continuation of cost containment measuresin respect of the Digestive Health and Other and Respiratory Healthcategories and divested brands. (ii) EMEA and LatAm (a) Revenue The Group's revenue attributable to EMEA and LatAm was \u00a33,877 million and \u00a34,059 million FY 2020, respectively. In 2021, the Group's revenue attributable to EMEA and LatAm decreased by 4.5 per cent. at AER, whilst revenue growth at CER was flat. Organic revenue growth in EMEA and LatAm was 3.5 per cent. This was principally driven by growth across the Pain Relief and Digestive Healthcategories, combined with lower revenue growth in the Oral Health, VMS andRespiratory Health categories. The decline in revenue at AER and flat growth in revenue at CER were largely a result of the full year revenue impact of divestments made during FY 2020,including Physiogel, Breathe Right, ThermaCare, Venoruton and Coldrex,partially offset in a number of brands, including Sensodyne,parodontax, Voltaren, Panadol and Centrum. Revenue at AER was negativelyimpacted by adverse currency exchange movements of \u00a3183 million asPounds Sterling strengthened, primarily against the Brazilian Real, TurkishLira, Russian Ruble, Argentine Peso and South African Rand. The EMEA and LatAm region delivered flat revenue at CER, which was attributable to several factors across the categories in which the Groupoperates: \u0081 Single digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the Oral Health category was driven by an increase in revenue attributable to Sensodyne,parodontax and, to a lesser extent, the Denture Care sub-category.Sensodyne revenue growth reflected price increases, as well as newproduct launches. Growth was partially offset by a decline in other brandsin the Oral Health category. \u0081 Revenue growth at CER in the VMS category was flat. There were increases in Centrum and Calsource revenue, which were offset bydeclines in revenue of smaller brands and the impact of divestments. \u0081 Mid-single digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the Pain Relief category was primarily driven by growth in Panadol revenue, whichreflected the strength of the brand and increased demand for paracetamolduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Voltaren also benefited from strongrevenue growth, which reflected price rises in key markets and acombination of innovation and promotional activity. 184 \u0081 A mid-single digit per cent. revenue decline at CER in the Respiratory Health category was largely attributable to the full year revenue impact ofdivestments made in FY 2020, including Breathe Right and Coldrex. Inaddition, there was an exceptionally weak cold and flu season. However,revenue for the category recovered in the second half of the year (seeparagraph 2.14 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) above). \u0081 A high-single digit per cent. revenue decline at CER in Digestive Health and Other revenue was primarily a result of the full year revenue impact ofa number of divestments made during FY 2020, (including ThermaCare,Physiogel and Venoruton) and the impact of the divestment of brands in FY2021 (including Transderm Scop and Baldriparan), in addition to adecrease in third party contract manufacturing sales related to previousdivestments. This decline was partially offset by an increase in revenueattributable to smaller brands. (b) Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit for EMEA and LatAm in FY 2021 was \u00a3960 million, producing an Adjusted operating profit margin of 24.8 per cent. Adjustedoperating profit for EMEA and LatAm in FY 2020 was \u00a3857 million, with anAdjusted operating profit margin of 21.1 per cent. The increase in Adjustedoperating profit margin of 3.7 per cent. reflected the following factors: \u0081 the further benefit of synergies resulting from the Pfizer Transaction and tight cost control; and \u0081 a favourable product mix and net revenue management initiatives, together with manufacturing efficiencies. The increase in Adjusted operating profit margin was partially offset by increased advertising and promotion spend to drive greater demand in anumber of markets in the region. (iii) APAC (a) Revenue The Group's revenue attributable to APAC in FY 2021 and FY 2020 was \u00a32,143 \u00a32,054 million, respectively. In FY 2021, the Group's revenue attributable to APAC increased by 4.3 per cent. at AER, and 7.1 per cent. at CER. Organic revenue growth in APAC was 9.1 per cent. in the period FY 2020 to FY 2021. This principally reflected growth across the Pain Relief and VMScategories, combined with lower revenue growth in the Oral Health, DigestiveHealth and Other and Respiratory Health categories. Growth in revenue at AER and CER was primarily driven by growth in revenue attributable to the VMS, Oral Health and Pain Relief categories. Revenue 185 growth at AER was affected by adverse foreign exchange movements of \u00a356 million as Pound Sterling strengthened against the Japanese Yen, IndianRupee, Philippine Peso and certain other currencies in the region. Revenue growth at CER was attributable to several factors across the categories in which the Group operates: \u0081 A single digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the Oral Health category was primarily due to growth in Sensodyne driven by India, China andJapan, combined with revenue growth of parodontax, as well as growth inDenture Care, where reduced social occasions impacted demand. \u0081 In the VMS category, low mid-teens per cent. revenue growth at CER was primarily attributable to growth in Caltrate and Centrum, supported bycampaigns focused on educating consumers about their immune systems. \u0081 In the Pain Relief category, low-teens per cent. revenue growth at CER was principally a result of revenue growth at CER in Panadol, whichbenefited from increased demand associated with COVID-19 vaccinationcampaigns in South East Asia and Taiwan and Australia, and revenuegrowth at CER in Voltaren, driven by distribution expansion in China andAustralia and new product launches in India. Fenbid sales in China wereflat, due to the continuation of a temporary ban on the sale of fevermedicine in parts of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u0081 A low-single digit per cent. revenue decline at CER in the Respiratory Health category was primarily due to the full year impact of the disposal ofBreathe Right and a decline in Theraflu revenue, driven by low cold and fluincidence. Contac revenue was adversely impacted by the continuation ofspecific bans on the over-the-counter sale of cough and cold medicines inChina. \u0081 A low-single digit per cent. revenue decline at CER in the Digestive Health and Other category was largely driven by the full year revenue impact ofthe divestment of Physiogel in FY 2020 and the divestment of Acne Aid inFY 2021. This decline was partially offset by growth in ENO revenue,mainly as a result of growth in India. (b) Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit for the APAC region in FY 2021 was \u00a3461 million, producing an Adjusted operating profit margin of 21.5 per cent. Adjustedoperating profit for the APAC region in FY 2020 was \u00a3377 million, producing anAdjusted operating profit margin of 18.4 per cent. The increase in the Adjusted operating profit margin of 3.1 percentage points principally reflected synergies arising from the Pfizer Transaction, disciplinedoverhead cost control and other operational efficiencies within manufacturing. This was partially offset by higher advertising and promotion investment as a percentage of revenue, reflecting the Group's launch of targeted public 186 campaigns (for example, to educate consumers about their immune systems), increased digital advertising to drive growth in Sensodyne and Voltaren, andincreased freight costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. (B) Regional performance for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to 31 December 2019 (i) North America (a) RevenueThe Group's revenue attributable to North America in FY 2020 was \u00a33,779 million. The Group's revenue attributable to North America in FY 2019(including the revenue of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business attributable toNorth America from 1 August 2019, when it was consolidated) was\u00a32,880 million. Revenue attributable to North America of the Pfizer ContributedCH Business for the seven months to 31 July 2019 was \u00a3845 million. The Group's revenue grew 31.2 per cent. at AER and 32.6 per cent. at CER.Organic revenue growth in the North America region was 0.7 per cent. for the period FY 2019 to FY 2020. This principally reflected growth in organic revenueacross the VMS, Pain Relief and Oral Health categories. This was partly offsetby a decline in revenue in the Respiratory Health category, due to the impact ofthe exceptionally low cold and flu incidence, and in the Digestive Health andOther category, including in respect of the brand Transderm Scop, whichexperienced revenue decline as a result of generic competition. TransdermScop was subsequently disposed of during FY 2021. Furthermore, organicrevenue growth for the period FY 2019 to FY 2020 excludes revenueattributable to brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction for the sevenmonths to 31 July 2020, during which these brands experienced a strongpositive revenue impact from consumer stockpiling and increased consumptionas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the overall growth of theNorth America region in the period FY 2019 to FY 2020 was reduced whenmeasured on an organic basis. Growth in revenue at AER and CER was primarily driven by the inclusion of the full year revenue of brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction (includingAdvil, Centrum and Emergen-C) in FY 2020, compared to five months in FY2019, together with growth in revenue attributable to Sensodyne and Voltaren,partially offset by a decline in Excedrin revenue and a number of divestments,including the divestment of Breathe Right. Revenue growth at AER was furtheroffset by adverse currency exchange movements of \u00a342 million as PoundsSterling strengthened against the US Dollar. The North America region delivered revenue growth at CER, which was attributable to a number of factors across the categories in which the Groupoperates: \u0081 High-single digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the Oral Health category was primarily driven by Sensodyne and parodontax, while 187 revenue in respect of brands in the Denture Care sub-category of Oral Health and Biot\u00e8ne remained broadly stable. Growth in Sensodyne wasreflective of the strength of the brand in the USA, as well as a number oflaunches, including Sensodyne Sensitivity and Gum and SensodynePronamel Intensive Enamel Repair. \u0081 Significant triple digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the VMS category was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full year revenue of brandsacquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction (including Emergen-C andCentrum), together with a growing consumer trend towards self-management of health and wellbeing. \u0081 High double digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the Pain Relief category was mainly driven by the Rx-to-OTC switch of Voltaren, togetherwith the inclusion of the full year of revenue of Advil, which was acquiredas part of the Pfizer Transaction. This was partially offset by temporarydisruption to Excedrin supply. \u0081 In the Respiratory Health category, mid-teens per cent. revenue growth at CER was mainly attributable to the inclusion of the full year revenue ofbrands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction (including Robitussin).Revenue in this category was however adversely impacted by theexceptionally low cold and flu incidence (see paragraph 2.14 of this Part VII(Operating and Financial Review ) above). \u0081 Similarly, in Digestive Health and Other, mid-teens per cent. revenue growth at CER was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full yearrevenue of brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction (includingChapstick and Preparation H). Abreva revenue declined due to the launchof a number of private-label brands in the USA, as well as fewer consumervisits to stores following the implementation of lockdowns during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Chapstick revenue was also negatively impacted byfewer consumer visits to stores during the COVID-19 pandemic. (b) Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit for the North America region in FY 2020 was \u00a3897 million, producing an Adjusted operating profit margin of 23.7 per cent.Adjusted operating profit for the North America region in FY 2019 (including theoperating profit of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business attributable to NorthAmerica from 1 August 2019, when it was consolidated) was \u00a3660 million,producing an Adjusted operating profit margin of 22.9 per cent. The year-on-year change in Adjusted operating profit margin of 0.8 percentage points reflected a number of factors, including: \u0081 synergies resulting from the Pfizer Transaction, principally in relation to reductions in SG&A costs as a result of headcount reductions; and \u0081 net savings in advertising and promotion spend as a percentage of revenue, resulting from cost containment measures taken in respect of the 188 Digestive Health and Other and Respiratory Health categories and divested brands, partially offset by investment in the VMS category andAdvil and Voltaren in the Pain Relief category. (ii) EMEA and LatAm (a) Revenue The Group's revenue attributable to EMEA and LatAm was \u00a34,059 million in FY 2020. The revenue attributable to EMEA and LatAm in FY 2019(including the revenue of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business attributable toEMEA and LatAm from 1 August 2019, when it was consolidated) was\u00a33,898 million. Revenue attributable to EMEA and LatAm from the PfizerContributed CH Business for the seven months to 31 July 2019 was\u00a3362 million. In FY 2020, the Group's revenue attributable to EMEA and LatAm increased by 4.1 per cent. at AER, and 8.4 per cent. at CER. Organic revenue growth inEMEA and LatAm was 3.1 per cent. for the period FY 2019 to FY 2020. Growth at AER and CER was primarily driven by the inclusion of the full year of revenue in FY 2020 of brands acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction,compared to five months in FY 2019, together with growth in Sensodyne,parodontax and Panadol revenue, partially offset by declines in Fenistil andOtrivin revenue. Revenue at AER was negatively impacted by adversecurrency exchange movements of \u00a3166 million primarily due to Pounds Sterlingstrengthening against the Brazilian Real, Russian Ruble, Argentine Peso andSouth African Rand. Organic revenue growth principally reflected double-digit per cent. growth in the VMS category, together with growth across the Pain Relief and Oral Healthcategories, partially offset by decline in organic revenue in the RespiratoryHealth and Digestive Health and Other categories. The EMEA and LatAm region delivered revenue growth at CER, which reflected a number of factors across the categories in which the Groupoperates: \u0081 Mid-single digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the Oral Health category was driven by an increase in revenue attributable to Sensodyneand parodontax. \u0081 Low triple digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the VMS category was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full year of revenue of brandsacquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction (including Centrum), togetherwith an increasing consumer trend towards self-management of health andwellbeing. \u0081 Low-teens per cent. revenue growth at CER in the Pain Relief category was primarily driven by Panadol, reflecting the strength of the brand andincreased demand for paracetamol during the COVID-19 pandemic.Voltaren revenue remained broadly flat. 189 \u0081 A mid-single digit per cent. revenue decline at CER in the Respiratory Health category was attributable to a reduction in respiratory illnesses suchas cold and flu as a result of measures implemented in response to theCOVID-19 pandemic. This negatively impacted Otrivin revenue. Therafluremained broadly stable. \u0081 There was a mid-single digit per cent. revenue decline at CER in the Digestive Health and Other category, with a reduction in Fenistil andbrands in the Smokers' Health sub-category of Digestive Health and Other,largely stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset bygrowth in ENO, driven by the Group's growth strategy in Brazil andincreased consumption in the Middle East and Africa. (b) Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit for EMEA and LatAm in FY 2020 was \u00a3857 million, producing an Adjusted operating profit margin of 21.1 per cent. Adjustedoperating profit for EMEA and LatAm in FY 2019 (including the Adjustedoperating profit of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business attributable to EMEAand LatAm from 1 August 2019, when it was consolidated) was \u00a3746 million,with an Adjusted operating profit margin of 19.1 per cent. The increase in Adjusted operating profit margin of 2.0 percentage points reflected the following factors: \u0081 synergies resulting from the Pfizer Transaction, principally in relation to reductions in SG&A costs as a result of headcount reductions; and \u0081 disciplined resource allocation in advertising and promotion spend as a percentage of revenue and net revenue management initiatives. (iii) APAC (a) Revenue The Group's revenue attributable to APAC in FY 2020 was \u00a32,054 million. The Group's revenue attributable to APAC in FY 2019 (including the revenue of thePfizer Contributed CH Business attributable to APAC from 1 August 2019,when it was consolidated) was \u00a31,702 million. The revenue attributable toAPAC from the Pfizer Contributed CH Business for the seven months to31 July 2019 was \u00a3316 million. The Group's revenue attributable to APAC increased by 20.7 per cent. at AER and 21.8 per cent. at CER. Organic revenue growth in APAC was 5.7 per cent.in the period FY 2019 to FY 2020. Growth in revenue at AER and CER was primarily driven by the inclusion of the full year of revenue of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business in FY 2020,compared to five months in FY 2019, particularly in the VMS category, togetherwith growth in revenue attributable to Sensodyne and Voltaren. Revenuegrowth at AER was further affected by adverse foreign exchange movementsof \u00a319 million as Pounds Sterling strengthened against Japanese Yen, TaiwanDollar and Philippine Peso and certain other currencies in the region. 190 Growth in organic revenue principally reflected strong, mid-thirties per cent. growth in the VMS category, together with low-single digit per cent. revenuegrowth in the Pain Relief category and high-single digit per cent. revenuegrowth in the Oral Health category, partially offset by a single digit per cent.revenue decline in the Digestive Health and Other categories and a doubledigit per cent. revenue decline in the Respiratory Health category. The latterreflected the historically weak cold and flu season and government restrictionsin response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue growth at CER was attributable to a number of factors across the categories in which the Group operates: \u0081 High-single digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the Oral Health category was primarily driven by Sensodyne, while revenue in respect ofbrands in the Denture Care sub-category of Oral Health remained broadlystable. Sensodyne growth was principally driven in China, Japan, Australiaand India. \u0081 Low triple digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the VMS category was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full year of revenue of brandsacquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction (including Centrum), togetherwith an increasing consumer trend towards self-management of health andwellbeing. Growth in Centrum was driven by China, the Philippines, Taiwanand Korea, where in FY 2020 the Group launched a public awarenesscampaign with the purpose of educating consumers about their immunesystems. Caltrate revenue was driven by increased penetration in theonline and retail channels. \u0081 Mid-single digit per cent. revenue growth at CER in the Pain Relief category was driven by strong growth in Voltaren, supported by priceincreases, together with product launches in India, partially offset by areduction in Fenbid sales in China as certain local authorities introducedtemporary restrictions on the sale of cough and cold medicines during theCOVID-19 pandemic. \u0081 A low double digit per cent. revenue decline at CER in the Digestive Health and Other category reflected a decline in Zentel and Physiogel, which wasdivested part way through FY20, partially offset by growth in Bactroban andENO. \u0081 A low double digit per cent. revenue decline at CER in the Respiratory Health category was due to lower instances of respiratory illnesses as aresult of the implementation of measures in response to the COVID-19pandemic. Contac and Robitussin were also impacted by COVID-19related temporary restrictions on the sale of cough and cold medicines incertain parts of China. (b) Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit for the APAC region in FY 2020 was \u00a3377 million, producing an Adjusted operating profit margin of 18.4 per cent. Adjusted 191 operating profit for the APAC region in FY 2019 (including the Adjusted operating profit of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business attributable to APACfrom 1 August 2019, when it was consolidated) was \u00a3311 million, producing anAdjusted operating profit margin of 18.3 per cent. The increase in the Adjusted operating profit margin of 0.1 percentage points reflected synergies resulting from the Pfizer Transaction, principally in relationto reductions in SG&A costs as a result of headcount reductions and highergross margin due to product mix, supply chain efficiencies and tight costcontrol. The increase was partially offset by greater advertising and promotioninvestment as a percent of revenue, reflecting targeted public campaignslaunched by the Group to educate consumers about their immune systems,increased digital advertising to drive growth in Sensodyne and Voltaren, andincreased advertising in relation to the launch of new products. 6.3 Adjusting Items Adjusting Items for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2020 Net intangible amortisation and impairment charges (pre-tax) decreased to \u00a316 million (\u00a324 million net of tax) in FY 2021 from \u00a397 million (\u00a378 million net of tax) in FY 2020. Thisreflected decreased impairment charges on indefinite and definite life brands, which reduced to\u00a312 million in FY 2021 from \u00a345 million in FY 2020, in addition to a smaller decrease inamortisation of definite life brands to \u00a340 million in FY 2021 from \u00a350 million in FY 2020,partially offset by an increase in the reversal of impairments of definite life brands to \u00a336 millionin FY 2021 from \u00a318 million in FY 2020. 2020, the impairment charge mainly includedimpairments of Zyrtec, capitalised costs for a discontinued oral care project and a discontinuedpain relief device and the reversal of impairments related to Transderm Scop. Restructuring costs (pre-tax) decreased to \u00a3195 million (\u00a3159 million net of tax) in FY 2021 from \u00a3411 million (\u00a3321 million net of tax in FY 2020). This reflected the reduction in integrationcosts related to the Pfizer Transaction. There were no Transaction-related costs (pre-tax) FY 2021, compared to \u00a391 million (\u00a371 million net of tax) in FY 2020. This was due to completion of the fair value unwind oninventory acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction that took place during FY 2019 and FY2020. Separation and Admission costs (pre-tax) increased to \u00a3278 million (\u00a3231 million net of tax) in FY 2021 from \u00a366 million (\u00a353 million net of tax) in FY 2020. These costs in FY 2021 mainlyconsisted of \u00a3257 million of costs in connection with Separation and \u00a319 million of costs inconnection with Admission, which reflected an increase in operational separation activity,compared with \u00a366 million of costs in connection with Separation in FY 2020. The \u00a3191 millionyear-on-year increase in Separation costs reflected an increase in operational separationactivity ahead of Separation and Admission. Disposals and others (pre-tax) resulted in net expense of \u00a345 million (\u00a3152 million net of tax) in FY 2021, compared to net income of \u00a3189 million (\u00a3120 million net of tax) in FY 2020. In FY2021, permanent differences on disposals, acquisitions and transfers including tax creditsrelating to an uplift in the tax basis of certain brands transferred intragroup resulted in a 192 reduction in the corporate tax charge of \u00a3164 million in the year. Additionally, this included \u00a360 million of historical adjustments, mainly relating to the write-off of expired tax indemnities,\u00a314 million of loss on the disposal of Transderm Scop and Scopoderm and \u00a316 million relatingto a tax indemnity payment to the Pfizer Group. These were partially offset by \u00a342 million ofprofit on the disposal of a number of brands and other credits of \u00a34 million. Adjusting Items for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 Net intangible amortisation and impairment charges (pre-tax) increased to \u00a397 million (\u00a378 million net of tax) in FY 2020 from \u00a336 million (\u00a331 million net of tax) in FY 2019. Thisprimarily reflected increased impairment charges on indefinite and definite life brands, whichgrew to \u00a345 million in FY 2020 from \u00a319 million in FY 2019, in addition to an increase inamortisation of definite life brands to \u00a350 million in FY 2020 from \u00a327 million in FY 2019,partially offset by an increase in the reversal of impairments of definite life brands to \u00a318 millionin FY 2020 from \u00a310 million in FY 2019. In FY 2020, the impairment charge mainly includedimpairments of Zyrtec, capitalised costs for a discontinued oral care project and a discontinuedpain relief device and the reversal of impairments related to Transderm Scop. In FY and Abreva and the reversal ofimpairments related to Prevacid. Restructuring costs (pre-tax) increased to \u00a3411 million (\u00a3321 million net of tax) in FY 2020 from \u00a3330 million (\u00a3271 million net of tax) in FY 2019, reflecting increased integration costs followingthe Pfizer Transaction, in addition to other restructuring and programme costs. Transaction-related costs (pre-tax) decreased to \u00a391 million (\u00a371 million net of tax) in FY 2020 from \u00a3366 million (\u00a3285 million net of tax) in FY 2019. This was due to the fact that the majorityof the fair value unwind on inventory acquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction took placeduring FY 2019. Separation and Admission costs (pre-tax) of \u00a366 million (\u00a353 million net of tax) in FY 2020 relate to preparation for Separation and Admission, which was commenced in FY 2020. Disposals and others (pre-tax) resulted in net income of \u00a3189 million (\u00a3120 million net of tax) in FY 2020, compared to a net expense of \u00a325 million (\u00a34 million net of tax) in FY 2019, arisingfrom the net profit from the disposal of a number of consumer healthcare brands. 7. Liquidity and capital resources 7.1 Overview The principal source of the Group's liquidity is cash generated from operations. The Group also has access to the debt capital markets through the Programme (as described below), as wellas the Revolving Credit Facilities (as described below) and a number of local borrowingfacilities in a variety of currencies and at floating rates in order to meet specific funding needsof certain subsidiaries in the Group. As at the date of this Prospectus, certain notes have beenissued under the Programme, an overview of the terms of which are set out at paragraph7.4(A) of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review) below. The Group also expects to establish 'Euro' and US Dollar commercial paper programmes, pursuant to which subsidiariesof the Group may issue commercial paper from time to time. It is expected that the Companywill guarantee payment of amounts owing in respect of any commercial paper issued undersuch programmes. 193 The Group's liquidity requirements primarily relate to servicing its ongoing debt obligations (including under the Programme, Pre-Separation USD Notes and the Revolving CreditFacilities), its working capital requirements, funding its operating expenses and capitalexpenditures (including its investments in R&D and advertising and promotion activities),funding dividend payments, and implementing the Group's growth strategies. In addition, it isexpected that the Term Loan Facility will be drawn in order to fund the Pre-Demerger Dividend. From completion of the Pfizer Transaction, liquidity management has been governed by certain provisions of the Pfizer SHA (see paragraph 15.5 of Part XII ( Additional Information )), including in relation to borrowings, cash management and shareholder funding and dividend payments.In order to manage any shortfall between cash in hand and an agreed amount of readilyavailable cash of \u00a3300 million, the Group entered into an uncommitted facility with arelationship bank, which has not been utilised. The Group manages liquidity risk through cashmanagement and forecasting processes under which the Group reviews its cash balances andmeasures its actual performance against forecasts in order to manage liquidity risk. The Groupalso monitors its exposure to foreign exchange rates and adopts hedging when it deemsappropriate. The Group intends to continue to apply a disciplined approach to capital allocation, investing for growth whilst maintaining an investment grade credit rating (see paragraph 3 of Part III(Business Overview )). As part of the Group's existing banking arrangements, a significant proportion of the Group's cash is on-lent to the GSK Group. As of 31 December 2021, cash and cash equivalents(including those amounts on-lent to the GSK Group) were primarily comprised US Dollar,Chinese Yuan, Euro and Pounds Sterling. Cash and cash equivalents included \u00a367 million notavailable for general use due to restrictions applying in the subsidiaries where it is held,including exchange controls and taxes on repatriation. 7.2 Cash flow The table below summarises the principal components of the Group's consolidated cash flows for the periods under review, which has been extracted from the Historical FinancialInformation. \u00a3m 2021 2020 2019 Cash flow from operating activities Profit after tax 1,439 1,181 687 Adjustments reconciling profit after tax to cash generatedfrom operations 227 780 408 Cash generated from operations 1,666 1,961 1,095Taxation paid (310) (554) (309) Net cash inflow from operating activities 1,356 1,407 786 Net cash inflow from investing activities (33) 1,030 291 Net cash (outflow) from financing activities (1,236) (2,437) (925) Increase in cash and bank overdrafts 87 - 152 Cash and bank overdrafts at the beginning of the year 323 329 191Exchange adjustments (5) (6) (14)Increase in cash and bank overdrafts 87 - 152 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year 405 323 329 194 Net cash (outflow)/inflow from operating activities Net cash inflow from operating activities was \u00a31,356 million and \u00a31,407 million in FY 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. Net cash inflow from operating activities was \u00a3786 million in FY 2019.Net cash inflow from operating activities for the Pfizer Contributed CH Business for the sevenmonths to 31 July 2019 was \u00a358 million. The year-on-year decrease of \u00a351 million from FY 2020 to FY 2021 was largely due to a decrease in cash generated from operations, which decreased by \u00a3295 million to\u00a31,666 million in FY 2021 from \u00a31,961 million in FY 2020, partially offset by a \u00a3244 millionreduction in tax paid. The decrease in cash generated from operations was primarilyattributable to a larger net outflow from working capital, as outlined below, partially offset byhigher operating profits. The year-on-year increase of \u00a3621 million from FY 2019 to FY 2020 was largely due to cash generated from operations, which increased by \u00a3866 million to \u00a31,961 million in FY 2020 from\u00a31,095 million in FY 2019, primarily attributable to the full year impact in FY 2020 of brandsacquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction, as compared to five months in FY 2019. Theincrease was also due to strong underlying growth in each of EMEA and LatAm, North Americaand APAC. In addition, reductions in working capital had a positive impact on cash flow, asoutlined below. Working capital The Group's working capital movements comprise movements in trade and other receivables, inventory and trade and other payables. The following table sets out changes in the Group's working capital for the periods indicated: Financial Year \u00a3m 2021 2020 2019 Decrease/(increase) in inventories (17) 130 232 Decrease/(increase) in trade receivables 14 18 (57)(Decrease)/increase in trade payables 41 140 (256)Net change in other receivables and payables (190) (273) (380)Changes in working capital (152) 15 (461) InventoryInventory increased by \u00a32 million to \u00a3951 million at 31 December 2021 from \u00a3949 million at 31 December 2020. This resulted in a negative cash flow of \u00a317 million in FY 2021. Thisimpact on cash flow was principally driven by inventory available in North America followingincreases in manufacturing output. Inventory was also affected by non-cash movements,including inventory transferred to assets held for sale and foreign exchange movements. Inventory reduced by \u00a3262 million to \u00a3949 million at 31 December 2020 from \u00a31,211 million at 31 December 2019. This resulted in a positive cash flow of \u00a3130 million in FY 2020. Thisimpact on cash flow was driven by activities designed to optimise inventory levels across thesupply chain, as well as the divestment of a number of brands and a reduction in inventoriesfor brands that experienced higher demand driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Inventory wasalso affected by non-cash movements, including fair value adjustments related to the PfizerTransaction and exchange rate movements. 195 Trade receivables Trade receivables declined by \u00a330 million to \u00a31,318 million at 31 December 2021 from \u00a31,348 million at 31 December 2020, driven by improvements to cash collection and exchangerate changes. This resulted in a positive cash flow of \u00a314 million in FY 2021. Non-cashmovements were related to foreign exchange fluctuations. Trade receivables declined by \u00a349 million to \u00a31,348 million at 31 December 2020 from \u00a31,397 million at 31 December 2019, driven by exchange rate changes, customers of thePfizer Contributed CH Business agreeing to adopt the shorter payment settlement periods ofthe GSK Group in the USA and accelerated settlement in APAC. This resulted in a positivecash flow of \u00a318 million in FY 2020. Cash movements included the positive impact ofcustomers of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business adopting the lower payment settlementperiods of the GSK Group in the USA, partially offset by higher receivables associated withincreased sales in APAC. Trade receivables were also impacted by non-cash movementsrelated to foreign exchange fluctuations. Trade payablesTrade payables increased by \u00a329 million to \u00a31,369 million at 31 December 2021 from \u00a31,340 million at 31 December 2020. This was driven by higher marketing spend in the fourthquarter of 2021, partially offset by changes in exchange rates. This resulted in a positive cashflow impact of \u00a341 million in FY 2021. Trade payables increased by \u00a3139 million to \u00a31,340 million at 31 December 2020 from \u00a31,201 million at 31 December 2019. This was driven by higher marketing spend and capitalexpenditure in the second half of the year, together with payables balances acquired by theGroup as part of the Pfizer Transaction after 31 July 2019. This resulted in a positive cash flowimpact of \u00a3140 million in FY 2020. Other receivables and payablesOther receivables declined by \u00a3121 million to \u00a3889 million at 31 December 2021 from \u00a31,010 million at 31 December 2020. Other receivables primarily consist of prepayments andreceivables with the Pfizer Group, the GSK Group and other third parties. Other payablesdecreased by \u00a3295 million to \u00a31,633 million at 31 December 2021 from \u00a31,928 million at31 December 2020. Other payables primarily consist of customer return and rebate accruals,wage, salary and social security accruals, VAT and deferred income. The net change in otherreceivables and payables resulted in a negative cash outflow of \u00a3190 million. This wasprimarily driven by an increase in balances receivable from GSK in relation to the Group's rightto receive profits of certain brands and businesses still legally owned by GSK and a decreasein operating balances payable to GSK in relation to certain payments made by GSK on behalfof the Group. Non-cash movements related to foreign exchange fluctuations. Other receivables declined by \u00a372 million to \u00a31,010 million at 31 December 2020 from \u00a31,082 million at 31 December 2019. Other receivables were the same as set out above. Otherpayables decreased by \u00a3291 million to \u00a31,928 million at 31 December 2020 from \u00a32,219 millionat 31 December 2019. Other payables were the same as set out above. The net change inother receivables and payables resulted in a negative cash outflow of \u00a3273 million, primarilydriven by a decline in third party receivables related to the Pfizer Transaction. Non-cashmovements related to foreign exchange fluctuations. 196 Net cash (outflow)/inflow from investing activities Net cash (used in)/generated from investing activities was a \u00a333 million outflow and a \u00a31,030 million inflow in FY 2021 and FY 2020, respectively. Net cash generated from investingactivities was \u00a3291 million in FY 2019. Net cash used in investing activities for the PfizerContributed CH Business for the seven months to 31 July 2019 was \u00a325 million. The year-on-year decrease of \u00a31,063 million from FY 2020 to FY 2021 principally reflected a decrease in the proceeds from the sale of intangible assets and proceeds from the divestmentprogramme. The net cash of \u00a333 million used in investing activities in FY 2021 was primarilyrelated to investment in property, plant and equipment and software. The year-on-year increase of \u00a3739 million from FY 2019 to FY 2020 was principally driven by proceeds from the sale of intangible assets, which increased by \u00a3804 million to \u00a3924 million inFY 2020 from \u00a3120 million in FY 2019, reflecting the divestment of a number of smaller brandsin the Group's portfolio, including Breathe Right and Physiogel. Disposal of businessesincreased to \u00a3221 million in FY 2020 due to the disposal of ThermaCare (see paragraph 2.13of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) above). Net cash (outflow)/inflow from financing activitiesNet cash used in from financing activities decreased by \u00a31,201 million to \u00a31,236 million in FY 2021 from \u00a32,437 million in FY 2020, reflecting decreased dividend payments. Dividends paidto shareholders decreased by \u00a31,223 million to \u00a31,148 million in FY 2021 from \u00a32,371 million inFY 2020, which, to a large degree, reflects the decrease in proceeds from the sale of intangibleassets and proceeds from the divestment programme. The quantum of dividend paymentsmade during the period also reflected arrangements entered into as part of the PfizerTransaction, which will terminate with effect from Admission. Net cash used in from financing activities increased by \u00a31,512 million to \u00a32,437 million in FY 2020 from \u00a3925 million in FY 2019 due to increased dividend payments. Dividends paid toshareholders increased by \u00a31,219 million to \u00a32,371 million in FY 2020 from \u00a31,152 million inFY 2019, which reflected the increased cash generation of the business following completion ofthe Pfizer Transaction. The quantum of dividend payments made during the period alsoreflected arrangements entered into as part of the Pfizer Transaction, which will terminate witheffect from Admission. Whilst no capital contributions were made in FY 2020, in FY 2019 acapital contribution of \u00a3335 million was made into the Group relating to the completion of thePfizer Transaction. Free cash flow and free cash flow conversionDuring the periods under review the Group delivered a total of \u00a33.8 billion free cash flow, driven by proceeds from divestments, a sharp focus on working capital discipline and stablecapital investment of approximately 3 per cent. of revenue per annum, partially offset by spendin relation to Restructuring costs and Separation and Admission costs. Financial Year 2021 2020 2019 Net cash inflows from operating activities (\u00a3m)1 1,356 1,407 786 Free cash flow (\u00a3m) 1,173 1,988 681 Free cash flow conversion (%) 82 168 99 197 Note 1. Included as the nearest IFRS measure to the non-IFRS measures presented in the table above. Free cash flow in FY 2021 was \u00a31,173 million, with a free cash flow conversion rate of 82 per cent. Free cash flow in FY 2020 was \u00a31,988 million, with a free cash flow conversion of 168 percent. Free cash flow in FY 2019 was \u00a3681 million, with a free cash flow conversion of 99 percent. Free cash flow decreased by 41.0 per cent. (\u00a3815 million) from FY 2020 to FY 2021. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily attributable to a decline in the proceeds from sale ofintangible assets, proceeds from the divestment programme and the decrease in net cashinflow from operating activities. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in thepurchase of intangible assets. Free cash flow increased by 191.9 per cent. (\u00a31,307 million) from FY 2019 to FY 2020. The increase in free cash flow was primarily attributable to the impact of proceeds received fromthe disposal of a number of brands (see \"Net cash flows (used in)/generated from investing activities\" above) of \u00a3924 million (FY 2019: \u00a3120 million). The increase in free cash flow was also attributable to the inclusion of the full year of operating cash flows in FY 2020 of brandsacquired as part of the Pfizer Transaction and strong performance in the Group's VMS, PainRelief and Oral Health categories, together with synergy savings and cost control. Thesefactors were partially offset by increased capital expenditure (see paragraph 7.5 of this Part VII(Operating and Financial Review ) below). 7.3 Net debt During the periods under review, the Group's principal source of liquidity was cash generated from operations. The Group did not have any long-term debt, excluding lease liabilities, in itscapital structure. In the period following completion of the Pfizer Transaction, excess cash wasdistributed to GSKCHH and PFCHH by way of dividends in accordance with the terms of thePfizer SHA, which will terminate with effect from Admission. Cash and cash equivalentsretained on the balance sheet following the payment of these dividends was primarily used bythe Group for working capital purposes, funding operating expenses and capital expenditures,and implementing the Group's growth strategies. As at 31 December 2021, the Group's netdebt consisted of lease liabilities, short-term bank borrowings and derivative financial liabilities,more than offset by cash and cash equivalents, liquid investments and derivative financialassets. In preparation for Separation, GSK Consumer Healthcare Capital UK plc, GSK Consumer Healthcare Capital NL B.V. and GSK Consumer Healthcare Capital US LLC each issued notes,the net proceeds of which have been made available to GlaxoSmithKline ConsumerHealthcare Finance Limited in order to fund the making of certain upstream loans to wholly-owned subsidiaries of GSK and Pfizer (see paragraph 7.4 of this Part VII ( Operating and Financial Review ) below). As at 31 December 2021, the Group had \u00a3991 million of outstanding gross indebtedness 85, comprising \u00a379 million of short-term borrowings, \u00a387 million of long-term borrowings and 85Indebtedness excludes loan amounts receivable from related parties of \u00a31,508 million as at 31 December 2021 where there is no right to offset. 198 \u00a3825 million of loan amounts owing to related parties. As at 31 March 2022, the Group had \u00a310,904 million of outstanding gross indebtedness86, comprising \u00a380 million of short-term borrowings, \u00a39,363 million of long-term borrowings and \u00a31,461 million of loan amounts owingto related parties. 7.4 Capital Resources and Indebtedness See Part VIII ( Capitalisation and Indebtedness ) for details relating the Group's capitalisation and indebtedness as at the dates indicated therein. Further details of the capital resources ofthe Group are set out in the summaries below. The unaudited pro forma statement of net assets of the Group set out in Section A of Part IX (Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information of the Group ) has been prepared to illustrate the impact of the Notes Proceeds Loans, the receipt of related party loans, additional borrowingsand the payment of the Pre-Demerger Dividend on the net assets of the Group as if suchtransactions had taken place on 31 March 2022. In particular, Note (7) illustrates the impact ofthese transactions on the net debt of the Group as if such transactions had taken place on31 March 2022. (A) Bond issuances As part of the preparation for Separation, on 16 March 2022, GSK Consumer Healthcare Capital UK plc and GSK Consumer Healthcare Capital NL B.V.

As at the Latest Practicable Date no amount has been borrowedunder the Term Loan Facility, although it is expected to be drawn on or prior to the dateof the Pre-Demerger Dividend. Any loan drawn under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the aggregate of: (i) the applicable risk free rate (being the Bank of England's SterlingOvernight Interbank Average Rate ('SONIA')); and (ii) a margin determined inaccordance with the terms of the Term Loan Facility, which is dependent on thecorporate rating assigned to the Company. The Term Loan Facility is made available on customary 'certain funds' terms and the proceeds of any utilisation under the Term Loan Facility are available for use, directlyor indirectly, towards the payment of the Pre-Demerger Dividend.

Property, plant and equipmentPurchase of property, plant and equipment was \u00a3228 million, \u00a3222 million and \u00a3190 million in FY 2021, FY 2020 and FY 2019, respectively.

The year-on-year of \u00a326 million from FY 2020 to FY 2021 was driven by decreased expenditure on the integration of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business into the Group. Theincrease of \u00a343 million from FY 2019 to FY 2020 was driven by increased expenses followingthe integration of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business into the Group.

Overview The Group's activities are subject to a rigorous regulatory framework on a local and international level that conditions and affects the Group's activities. The process of obtainingregulatory approvals and ongoing compliance with applicable laws, regulations and otherrequirements require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The following is a summary of the regulatory landscape applicable to the Group's business in the key markets in which the Group operates. Where there are material differences, theapplicable local regulatory framework is also summarised in respect of the USA, EU and/orChina, being key markets for the Group's business from a regulatory perspective. Paragraphs2 to 5 of this Part X ( Regulatory Overview ) below summarise the applicable laws, regulations and other requirements that are materially relevant to the Group's consumer healthcareproducts. The Group has products in a number of different regulatory classifications. From a regulatory perspective, the majority of the Group's products can be categorised according to four principalregulatory classifications: (i) OTC medicines; (ii) medical devices; (iii) foods; and (iv) cosmetics.These classifications and their application to a given product in a given market may varyaccording to jurisdiction, the nature of the product and changes in law, among other variables.For example, while supplements are typically regulated as foods, in certain jurisdictions theymay be regulated as medicines where they mitigate disease states or their ingredient levelsexceed locally defined maximum thresholds for supplements. Accordingly, certain products willbe subject to varying levels of regulation in different markets. Additional laws, regulations and other requirements materially relevant to the Group's business are summarised in paragraphs 6 to 12 of this Part X ( Regulatory Overview ) below. 2. OTC medicines Medicines are broadly defined as any product (or any ingredient(s) of such product) with an intended use to treat, prevent or cure a disease or medical condition. There are two mainclassifications of medicines: (i) those requiring a prescription; and (ii) those that can be boughtover-the-counter without a prescription. Examples of OTC medicines include analgesics suchas ibuprofen and paracetamol (known as as antacids; and decongestants such as xylometazoline and oxymetazoline. 2.1 Regulation of OTC medicines In general, regulations applicable to prescription medicines also apply to OTC medicines. Regulations relating to manufacturing, testing, facility registration and inspection, clinical trials,importation, safety monitoring and risk management apply equally to both classifications. Theprinciples followed are the guidelines and standards published by the International Council forHarmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (\" ICH\"), of which the USA, the EU and China are all members. The ICH brings together regulatoryauthorities and the pharmaceutical industry to discuss scientific and technical aspects ofpharmaceuticals and to develop ICH guidelines. The ICH guidelines cover quality, efficacy andsafety aspects, among other topics. There are additionally often specific regulations that applyto OTC products to address unique issues common to these types of medicines. 218 USA In the USA, the Group must comply with laws, regulations and other requirements promulgated by numerous federal and state authorities, including the United States Food and DrugAdministration (\" FDA \") and other agencies and divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies of the Departmentof Justice, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency,Customs and Border Protection (for imports and exports), the Federal Trade Commission(\"FTC\") and state agencies. Applicable legal requirements govern, to varying degrees, the research, development, manufacturing, commercialisation and sale of the Group's products,including pre-clinical and clinical testing, approval, production, labelling, sale, distribution,import, export, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information andpromotion. Failure to comply with applicable legal requirements can result in product recalls,seizures, injunctions, refusal to approve or withdrawal of approval of product applications,monetary fines or criminal prosecution. The FDA is the principal regulator of OTC medicines. Its authority comes primarily from the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended. In addition to reviewing New DrugApplications (\" NDAs \") for branded drugs and Abbreviated New Drug Applications (\" ANDAs \") for generic drugs and overseeing the OTC drug monograph framework, the FDA has theauthority to ensure that drugs introduced into interstate commerce are not \"adulterated\". Forthese purposes, adulterated means that the product or its manufacture does not comply withFDA quality and related standards. A drug is adulterated if, among other things: (i) it isprepared under unsanitary conditions such that it may have been contaminated or may causeinjury to patients; (ii) its manufacture does not comply with Good Manufacturing Practice(\"GMP \"); (iii) it does not comply with an official compendium; (iv) its strength, purity or quality differs from that which it purports to possess; or (v) it is manufactured, processed or held in afacility which refuses FDA inspection. EUIn the EU, medicinal products are subject to extensive pre- and post-marketing regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and Member State (national) levels. The EU system isbased on a closely coordinated regulatory network of national competent authorities in the EEAworking together with the European Medicines Agency (\" EMA \") and the European Commission, whose principal role is to take binding decisions based on the scientificrecommendations delivered by the EMA. The network was built to help ensure that safe,effective and high-quality medicines are authorised throughout the EU, and that patients,healthcare professionals and citizens are provided with adequate and consistent informationabout medicines. ChinaIn China, the National Medical Products Administration (\" NMPA \") is the primary regulatory authority. Its objectives are: (i) to supervise the safety of drugs (including traditional Chinesemedicines and ethno-medicines), medical devices and cosmetics; (ii) to regulate theregistration of drugs, medical devices and cosmetics; and (iii) to undertake associatedstandards management. There are a number of institutions affiliated with the NMPA, including:the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control; the Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission;the Center for Drug Evaluation (\" CDE \"); the Center for Food and Drug Inspection; the Center for Drug Reevaluation; and the Center for Medical Device Evaluation. China has significantly 219 updated its regulatory framework under the Drug Administration Law of 2019, issuing new regulations to modernise the healthcare system. 2.2 Marketing authorisation process A licence is generally required to market a medicine. Regulatory agencies issue a product licence based on a marketing authorisation application (\" MAA \") dossier. A dossier is compiled and submitted to regulatory authorities in accordance with local regulations. Once a licence isgranted, the marketed product must be compliant with its registered details and any change tothe technical details requires an update to the registration. However, in some instances, localregulations may allow marketing without a specific prior approval, provided defined criteria aremet. The licence indicates the legal status of the product: prescription or OTC, as well as any other restrictions on the marketing or use of the product. Regulatory agencies may have differentviews on whether a particular product is appropriate to be marketed as OTC in their countries. In some instances, a regulatory agency may issue certain conditions for approval, referred to as post-marketing commitments or obligations. This may mean that the company must conducta Phase IV (or post-marketing) study in order to provide the agency with additional informationabout the use of the medicine in the general population under marketing conditions. Failure tocomply can result in licence revocation. Site inspectionsSite inspections are a routine aspect of a regulatory authority's review of the MAA to ensure medicines are manufactured in accordance with GMP. Inspections by the FDA or EU agenciesmay be recognised for registration in international markets outside of the USA and EU.However, some local regulatory authorities require conduct of their own site inspections.Scheduling and waiting for the results of these site inspections is time consuming, often addingone to two years to the registration process. USAIn order to market and sell a new drug product in the USA, a drug manufacturer must either: (i) file an NDA that shows the quality, safety and effectiveness of the new drug; (ii) file anANDA that demonstrates equivalence of a generic to another company's branded drugproduct; or (iii) comply with the OTC drug monograph requirements, which are the rules foreach therapeutic category establishing conditions, such as active ingredients, uses, doses andtesting, under which an OTC drug is generally recognised as safe and effective and can bemarketed without an NDA and FDA pre-market approval. EUIn the EU, application dossier content requirements for medicinal products are set by the European Commission and, like the USA and many other markets, are aligned with ICHguidelines. There are several administrative mechanisms to request regulatory approval of amedicine (both prescription and non-prescription): (i) the centralised procedure, which is an EUauthorisation route resulting in a single marketing authorisation valid in all EU Member Statesand EEA countries; (ii) the mutual recognition procedure, resulting in a mutually recognisedproduct (used where a product is already authorised in at least one Member State and 220 approval is sought in at least one other Member State); (iii) the decentralised procedure, resulting in a mutually recognised product (used where a product is not already authorised inany Member State and the centralised procedure is not available or selected); and (iv) thestandalone national procedure for authorisation in a single Member State. ChinaIn China, applications to market medicinal products are covered under the Drug Registration Regulation 2020, which covers, among other requirements, GMP and requirements of goodclinical practice (\" GCP \"). \"Technical guidance\", issued by the CDE, indicates Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control data and both clinical and non-clinical requirements. The keyelements of any regulatory application are quality, safety and efficacy, and, until recently, therehas been one process for the registration of all medicines in China, irrespective of prescriptionor OTC status. However, the new Drug Registration Regulation 2020 provides an alternateprocess for OTC medicines, which maintains the principles of quality, safety and efficacy. 2.3 Post-marketing authorisation Compliance with registered details and post-marketing changesOnce the marketing authorisation licence is granted, the company is required to comply with the conditions of approval and must always ensure that the product label used in the market iscompliant with the registration and that the product is manufactured and supplied incompliance with registered details. Non-compliance can lead to product recalls or other action by the regulatory authority, often posted publicly. This may involve fines, licence revocation and/or increased inspection of themanufacturing sites and/or other products marketed by the company. Any changes to registered details relating to the marketing authorisation require registration updates, which may require regulatory authority approval (and potentially a review fee) prior toimplementation. This mostly applies to changes that could impact product quality(manufacturing implications), safety or efficacy (e.g. a new indication). When such approval isrequired, the review times vary depending on the type and extent of the change. Followingapproval, the changes form part of the licence requirement and must be implemented withinthe timeframe required by the local regulator. Licence maintenance and expirationMany regulatory authorities grant licences that are effective for a specified period of time, after which a renewal application must be submitted to continue to market the product. This renewalperiod is typically every five years. Once a licence is granted, it is the company's obligation tokeep the licence effective. If a product is never marketed or if a renewal application is notsubmitted on time, the licence is lost. 2.4 Other OTC medicines regulations Rx-to-OTC switchesAn Rx-to-OTC switch refers to the process by which the legal classification of a drug changes from Rx (prescription) to OTC (non-prescription) status. This involves the generation of 221 extensive supportive data to establish that the drug can be used safely and effectively by consumers based only on their understanding of the product labelling and without theintervention of a healthcare professional. Rx-to-OTC switches require in-depth consideration of the inherent safety profile and efficacy of a drug, balanced with mitigation of the potential increased risks associated with OTCavailability. They also require consideration of the capability of consumers to use the productappropriately based on labelling and associated instructions. For a drug to be suitable for OTC status: (i) the indication must be for a condition that a consumer can recognise themselves; (ii) the benefit of the product must exceed the risks(including any potential adverse events being of low incidence and easily identifiable byconsumers); (iii) the potential to misuse or abuse the drug must be low; (iv) the labelling of theproduct must be compliant (see paragraph 7 of this Part X ( Regulatory Overview ) below); and (v) there must be data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of the product. This supportingdata includes detailed analysis of the drug's safety from clinical studies and in-market use, aswell as label comprehension studies and sometimes \"actual use\" studies, which demonstrateappropriate consumer selection/deselection and product use that complies with labelinstructions. Other market-specific requirementsNational authorities sometimes have requirements and internal procedures for assessing product quality, efficacy and safety for marketing authorisations, for example, requiring localmarket study data to demonstrate relevance to the target market population. However, manyrequirements can be managed by providing additional certificates or notarising documentationto provide assurance of data authenticity from markets where permits or approvals havealready been obtained. Certificate of Pharmaceutical ProductThe WHO, in an effort to assist smaller regulatory authorities with marketing authorisation applications, particularly those that may not have the ability to assess product qualityindependently, established a recommended format for a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product(\"CoPP \"). This certificate is required by the importing country as part of the local registration procedure in certain markets. CoPPs are issued for each drug product. Many countries require,or strongly prefer, a CoPP issued by the regulatory authority in the country of manufacture (or\"source\" CoPP). Some countries accept a \"non-source\" CoPP, but this is typically by exception.Before requesting a CoPP, the medicine must first be registered and, in many cases,marketed. Import and exportUSAImporters of medicines to the USA must comply with United States Customs and Border Protection documentation requirements and examination. Perceived violations will be refusedadmission and a notice of detention and hearing may be issued. If the FDA ultimately refusesadmission, a redelivery notice may be received with a notice for damages for up to three timesthe product value. 222 Products for export from the USA are subject to the import requirements of the importing foreign country and, if the product is not approved in the USA, the company must apply to theFDA for appropriate export documentation. EUManufacturers and importers of medicinal products located in the EEA must hold a manufacturing authorisation issued by the national competent authority of the Member Statewhere such activities are being carried out. The manufacturer or importer must have a qualifiedperson who is responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured inaccordance with EU GMP before releasing the product for commercial distribution in the EU orfor use in a clinical trial. Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by thecompetent regulatory authorities for compliance with GMP. ChinaImports to and exports from China follow the same principles as the USA and EU. Chinese importers must provide necessary documents (including, for example, import drug licence,GSP licence, business licence, imported batch product's certificate of analysis / country oforigin / order / commercial invoice / packing list / bill of lading, local drug test report andhistorical import evidence, in each case as applicable) to the provincial healthcare authoritiesor NMPA, who in turn provide a customs form for the importer to present at China customs.Failure to meet the requirements results in the rejection of goods at the border. Where medicines are being imported, an import drug licence is required, which grants the manufacturer the right to register, import, sell and use the imported drug in China. In theapplication process for the import drug licence, the NMPA: reviews a dossier documenting thequality, safety and efficacy of the drug; verifies the quality specification of the drug; andperforms a sample test on three batches of the drug. Once granted, the licence remains activefor a five-year renewable period. 3. Medical devices Medical devices are broadly defined as products which a manufacturer intends to be used to diagnose, prevent, monitor, predict, treat or alleviate disease. Devices generally achieve theirpurpose by physical modes of action; the principal intended action may not bepharmacological, immunological or metabolic. 3.1 Classification of medical devices Although different regulatory authorities have different systems of review before a medical device can be marketed, they all apply a risk management approach to classify devices. Allmedical devices must satisfy safety and performance, quality system (some low-risk devicesmay be exempt) and labelling requirements. The degree of regulatory scrutiny increases withthe potential risks of the medical device. The purpose of risk classification is to ensure that the regulatory controls applied to a medical device are proportionate to the risk. Most markets have an overall I-III classification system,with class I being the lowest risk and class III being the highest. Class III devices usuallysupport life, present high risk of illness or injury, or are implanted. Examples includepacemakers and catheters. Class II devices present more moderate risk to the user and 223 include, for example (under the MDR (as defined below) in the EU), denture cleansers, denture adhesives, pain-relieving heat patches and therapeutic toothpastes. Class I devices have thelowest perceived risk and include devices such as, liquid medicine measuring cups, spectaclesand bandages. The Group's products, throughout its global portfolio, are largely classifiednationally as Class II or Class I medical devices. The regulatory requirements increase as the device risk class increases. These regulatory controls may include, for example, those in relation to: (i) the operation of a quality system forall devices; (ii) the need for and frequency of independent external audit of the manufacturer'squality system; (iii) a reference technical file with support data defining performance andcontrols; (iv) independent external review of the technical data; (v) product testing usingin-house or independent resources; and (vi) documentation of relevant clinical evidence tosupport the manufacturer's claims. 3.2 Market authorisation USAIn the USA, most Class III devices and new devices that are not substantially equivalent to an already legally marketed product require clearance through a Pre-Market Approval (\" PMA \"). There must be documented safety and effectiveness data for the device and clinical data isrequired. Where a PMA is not needed, most Class II and some Class I devices require a 510ksubmission, which must demonstrate how the proposed medical device is substantiallyequivalent to a medical device that is already on the US market and an FDA clearancedecision is generally received within 150 days. Most Class I and some Class II devices areexempt from a 510k submission before sale, but are still subject to general controlrequirements. For low-risk products for which there is no legally marketed substantiallyequivalent device in the USA (and therefore the 510k submission is inappropriate or hasresulted in a not substantially equivalent determination), there is the De Novo classificationrequest. This provides a pathway to classify novel medical devices for which general controlsalone, or general and special controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety andeffectiveness for the intended use. The De Novo review is a stringent process. Devices that areclassified into Class I or Class II through a De Novo request may be marketed and used aspredicates for future 510k submissions. EUIn the EU, manufacturers may self-certify compliance of Class I devices with simple notifications to the competent authority, with files open to inspection should a competentauthority wish to do so. Class II devices, as well as some Class I devices (those with ameasuring function or sterility requirements), require the involvement of an approved notifiedbody which audits files / manufacturers on behalf of the competent regulatory authority.Class III devices generally require the involvement of a notified body and often the competentauthority as well. Following product clearance, the manufacturer signs a declaration ofconformity and places the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne CE mark on or with the device. In May 2021, the Medical Device Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745) (\" MDR \") came into effect in the EU, with new in-vitro diagnostic regulations anticipated in 2022. The MDR is morecomprehensive than the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC). The MDR greatly increases therigor and robustness of the regulations governing medical device products in EU markets.There is no \"grandfathering\" of products: all products are expected to meet the MDR 224 requirements. Additionally, all products and their manufacturers are subject to re-review by the notified body on a yearly cycle (for Class IIb and Class III devices) or every two years (forClass IIa devices) or a \"periodic\" review up to every four years (for Class I devices). ChinaIn China, the NMPA is the institution responsible for both medical devices and medicines. For locally manufactured devices in China, Class I and Class II devices go respectively to themunicipal and provincial authorities to obtain market authorisation approval. All Class IIIdevices and devices not manufactured in China go to the NMPA. In the latter case,manufacturers must send the appropriate documentation showing that the device has beenapproved in its country of origin. To register a device, type testing is required. In most cases, device samples are provided to an NMPA-accredited institute for testing. It may also be required to provide supportive clinical dataalong with the application, especially for higher risk devices. Foreign manufacturers must also have China-based agents that will represent their interests in China. The responsibilities of the designated agents include providing technical service andmaintenance support for the device, assisting with device recall (if recall is required),overseeing the registration process, and providing support for the manufacturer in caseadverse events occur due to device malfunction. Medical device registrations in China are valid for five years. Market authorisation holders must: (i) ensure the quality of their products; (ii) show that their products meet all applicablerequirements; (iii) submit self-inspection reports to relevant authorities every year; and(iv) maintain their products' information in the NMPA's unique device identification database. 4. Food (dietary supplements)4.1 General Products in the food classification include vitamins, minerals and supplements to be ingested as part of a daily diet. Most food products do not require pre-market authorisation, althoughspecific categories of foods (such as food supplements, foods for special medical purposes ordietary supplements in China) may require notification of sale to applicable regulatory bodies.In some countries, such as China, products classified as functional health foods also require aformal pre-market review and registration process. The food industry typically avoids registration as a form of food control in favour of systems based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (\" HACCP \"), an internationally recognised method of assessing, preventing and managing food safety risks, with low-risk foods subject tofew controls and high-risk foods subject to more controls. The majority of products marketed by the Group in this classification are regulated as dietary supplements. However, some supplements may instead be regulated as medicines, forexample, where they mitigate disease states or their ingredient levels exceed locally defined,e.g. recommended dietary allowances, to be categorised as a supplement. 225 4.2 Market authorisation Dietary supplementsA dietary supplement is a product taken by mouth that contains a dietary ingredient intended to supplement the diet. A \"dietary ingredient\" is one, or any combination, of a vitamin, a mineral, aherb or other botanical, an amino acid, a dietary substance for use by the consumer tosupplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake (e.g. enzymes or tissues from organsor glands), or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent or extract. In most markets, dietary supplements do not require a submission or approval prior to launch, although novel ingredients may require supporting submissions, as may new claims.Notification procedures prior to or immediately after sale commences are typically required. 4.3 Food safety Safety and packagingFor the most part, food laws adopt a principled, risk-management approach to ensure safety of the food chain. They lay down basic good hygiene and safety prerequisites, and require foodbusinesses to assess ingredient risk and to remove or mitigate those risks following theHAACP framework. One area of food safety that poses a specific risk to consumers different from most cosmetics or medical devices and some medicinal products is the degree of exposure to substances thatmigrate from food contact packaging materials into foodstuffs. Therefore, primary foodpackaging in contact with food is subject to a suite of complex, food-specific legislation drivenby these safety concerns. CompositionComposition is intimately linked to safety. Any food ingredient without a history of safe consumption is termed a novel food or new dietary ingredient and cannot be sold as a food oradded to a food without pre-authorisation by relevant regulatory agencies. This authorisationrequires the applicant to rigorously demonstrate the safety of the substance, and this complexprocess can sometimes take years to accomplish. Food products often require and use additives (e.g. colours, preservatives, stabilisers, emulsifiers). There are lists of permitted additives that are regularly evaluated and many havemaximum permitted levels. The use of a new additive, or the use of an existing additive for apurpose not explicitly permitted by law, requires pre-authorisation, and food manufacturers arerequired to demonstrate both safety and technical need before a new additive use isauthorised. 5. Cosmetics5.1 General Cosmetics are products that are applied to external parts of the human body (generally also including the teeth and mucous membranes of the oral cavity) for cleansing, beautifying,promoting attractiveness or altering the appearance without affecting the body's structure or 226 functions. They typically include examples such as shampoo, deodorant, perfume and some toothpastes. However, products can be classified differently by country or region, and acosmetic in one country may be classified as a medicine, or even a medical device, in anothercountry. For example, fluoride toothpaste is a cosmetic in the EU and a drug in the USA. Otherproducts regulated as drugs in the USA include mouthwashes marketed with therapeuticclaims, skin protectants (such as lip balms) and treatments for dandruff or acne. 5.2 Market authorisation Regulations on market authorisation for cosmetics differ by country or region. Some countries require pre-market approvals, while others require no registration. Where approval is required,the standard of documentation required to market cosmetics differs by country. For example,some countries require a robust dossier (which will include safety assessments, detailedmanufacturing information, raw material functionality and other pertinent information) wheremanufacturers present documentation to the health ministries to be approved or denied. Insome other countries, documentation is not required to be presented and can remain on filewith the manufacturer. 6. Clinical trials for OTC medicines The beginning of the development phase for a new drug involves pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo laboratory studies to assess the potential effects of substances and examine chemical-physicalproperties, toxicological data and other information. Following positive pre-trial results andapproval, the drug in question is tested in humans in clinical trials which consist of four phases,each phase requiring increasingly large, complex, costly and time-consuming clinical studies.The first three phases must take place before market authorisation is obtained (see paragraph2.2 of this Part X ( Regulatory Overview ) above). Clinical trials are subject to the GCP requirements set out by the ICH in the USA, the EU, China and other ICH markets. These include the requirement that all research patients providetheir informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. USAThe pre-clinical and clinical development paths in the USA are broadly similar to those in the EU (described below) and are governed by the same GCP requirements. Before commencingthe clinical trial, an Investigational New Drug Application is submitted to the FDA and thesponsor must also obtain a favourable opinion from an independent ethics committee. Aprotocol and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA. In addition,an institutional review board at each institution participating in the trial must review andapprove the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information aboutcertain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes ofHealth for public dissemination on their website. Regulatory authorities, institutional reviewboards or the sponsors may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on variousgrounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptablehealth risk. EUIn the EU, prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a Clinical Trial Authorisation (\" CTA \") from the competent authority of the Member State in which the trial will be conducted, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. In the EU, the 227 European Medicines Agency manages this process centrally through the Clinical Trials Information System (\" CTIS \") which allows assessment, authorisation and maintenance of clinical trials through a single entry point for both health authority and ethics committeeconsiderations across all Member States. This harmonises the process for all Member Statesand ensures the same GCP standards are applied across all Member States. Every clinical trialmust have a sponsor and any sponsor that is not established within the EEA must appoint alegal representative in the jurisdiction. The CTA application includes, among other things, atrial protocol detailing the objectives, design, methodology, statistical considerations andorganisation of the trial, and an investigational medicinal product dossier with information aboutthe manufacture and quality of the drug being investigated. During the trial, any substantialchanges to the protocol or any adverse side effects reported must be notified to the competentauthority and ethics committee via the CTIS portal. Following the trial, the sponsors must postclinical trial results in the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials database. ChinaAs in the EU and USA, clinical trials in China require compliance with ICH and GCP principles and pre-trial approval from both the regulator, the NMPA, and an ethics committee. For certainstudies, approval from both central and local ethics committees may be required. Approval mayalso be required before commencing studies of certain cosmetics, such as toothpaste, or whennew claims or ingredients are being proposed. For clinical studies collecting human biologicalsamples, additional approval is needed from the Office of Human Genetic ResourcesAdministration. China has stringent requirements relating to site governance, managed throughGCP offices located within hospitals. Any amendments to trial protocol or safety concerns mustbe reported to the relevant authorities, who have the power to suspend or terminate a trialbased on various grounds. Following a clinical trial, the sponsor must publish the trial results ina publicly accessible registry. 7. Claims and labelling The labelling for all product classifications which the Group markets, including OTC medicines, medical devices, foods and cosmetics, is subject to applicable laws in all of the markets inwhich the Group operates. Labelling regulations differ by market and product classification.They may specify text format and the order of information, as well as require specificinformation and statements. For example, they may require inclusion of, among other things,product identity, product ingredients, the name and place of business of the manufacturer,packer or distributor, net quantity of contents, expiry date, batch number, registration numberand instructions for appropriate use. Claims in advertisements and on labels must be truthful, not misleading, not unfair, and substantiated, and regulatory authorities may take enforcement action against businesseswhich fail to comply with relevant rules. The extent of substantiation required for a claim, aswell as the level of regulatory scrutiny applied by authorities, is dependent on the productclassification and product's risk profile, with OTC medicines typically requiring greatersubstantiation, and varies from country to country. USAThe FTC, FDA and other government agencies enforce compliance with applicable laws on product claims, which broadly require claims to be truthful, not misleading and sufficientlysubstantiated with scientific evidence on the benefits and safety of the product. The FTC will 228 also consider how consumers will interpret claims, including in circumstances where the claim may be technically true, but the advertisement and what is implied may nonetheless bemisleading. There are specific requirements for different product classifications. For example, while cosmetic labelling does not require FDA approval prior to going on market, the FDA regulatescosmetic labelling claims and monitors, and takes action against, claims which are not truthful,are misleading or make medicinal claims. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,the FDA may take action against \"misbranding\" violations, which include where the cosmetic'slabel does not include all required information or such information is not adequately prominentand conspicuous. Similarly, for foods, businesses are responsible for evaluating the safety andlabelling of their products before marketing to ensure that they meet all the requirements ofapplicable FDA regulations and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. TheFDA is responsible for taking action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplementproduct after it reaches the market. EUAdvertising of products is subject both to general consumer advertising requirements pursuant to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive 2005/29/EC), which states a generalprohibition on misleading and aggressive advertising, as well as more specifically in respect ofeach product classification. For example, advertisements of medicinal products must: (i) be setout in such a way that it is clear that the message is an advertisement and that the product isclearly identified as a medicinal product; (ii) not refer, in improper, alarming or misleadingterms, to claims of recovery; and (iii) not give the impression that a medical consultation orsurgical operation is unnecessary (pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC). The advertising and promotion of a medical device must be undertaken in accordance with its intended purpose. The MDR prohibits use of text, names, trade marks, pictures and figurativeor other signs that may mislead the user or the patient with regard to the device's intendedpurpose, safety and performance. New health claims made on foods need to be reviewed with a positive opinion by the European Food Safety Agency and approved by the European Commission. The objective is to ensurethat any claim made on a food's labelling, presentation or advertising in the EU is clear,accurate and based on scientific evidence. The EU has also established a legal framework for cosmetic labelling claims based on the Cosmetics Products Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009). Responsible persons mustensure that a cosmetic product made available on the market is safe for human health whenused under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, taking into account, inparticular: (i) presentation; (ii) labelling; (iii) instructions for use and disposal; and (iv) any otherindication or information provided by the responsible person. ChinaIn China, there is similarly an extensive regulatory framework on advertising and product claims. Among other requirements, OTC medicine advertisements must not contain difficult orconfusing medical or pharmaceutical terms which may mislead the public about the effect andsafety of the proposed products. An advertisement must make clear that the product is OTC byincluding the OTC logo. All medical device advertisements must contain the name of the 229 approved medical device, name of the manufacturing enterprise, registration certificate number and advertisement licence number. All information must conform to the product certificateissued by the NMPA. The Cosmetic Supervision Administration and Regulation, which cameinto force on 1 January 2021, enhances regulatory requirements in respect of cosmetic claims,including that applicants must submit sufficient scientific evidence on the NMPA's website forclaim substantiation. The NMPA also enforces categories of permissible and prohibited claimsin respect of foods. 8. Consumer safety and quality Consumer safetyManufacturers of OTC medicines, cosmetics, medical devices and foods must ensure that their products are safe for consumers to use. Vigilance regulations across the world play animportant role in ensuring the safety of all products whether in the development pipeline,already approved for marketing, or post-launch. These regulations are different for each type ofproduct but in all cases require the collection, detection, assessment, monitoring andprevention of adverse events/undesirable effects. Once approved for marketing, the holder of amedicinal marketing authorisation must also establish and maintain a pharmacovigilancesystem as described in ICH guidelines. The obligations include expedited reporting of adversereactions, submission of periodic safety update reports and proactive detection of signals/trends. Pharmacovigilance systems can be subject to inspection by health authorities andcorrective actions may be required to address any deficiencies identified. For medical devices,manufacturers must also expedite reporting of serious safety events, prepare periodic safetyupdate reports and proactively analyse trends, with documentation held at manufacturingfacilities for inspection. For cosmetics and foods, \"serious undesirable events\"/adverse eventsare tracked and analysed to ensure that products are fit for use. QualityQuality regulations across the world play an important role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of consumer healthcare products. The regulations are required both for new innovations andalready existing products. Every country has its own regulations which apply to innovation,manufacturing / good manufacturing practices, testing, marketing, post-marketing studies andreporting by product classification (e.g. medicines, medical devices, cosmetics and dietarysupplements). Regulators conduct pre-approval and post-approval inspections of facilities involved in the development, manufacturing, packaging and testing of drugs to ensure GMP compliance. If aninspection results in a finding, corrective actions to address the deficiencies must beperformed. Adverse inspections can lead to inspectional observations, warning letters, seizure,recalls, injunctions and shutdown of facilities. Medical devices are subject to quality system regulations. A quality system is the organisational structure, responsibilities, procedures, processes and resources needed toimplement quality management for medical devices. Quality system regulations cover themethods, facilities and controls used by the manufacturer in the design, manufacture,packaging, labelling, storage, installation, servicing and post market handling of medicaldevices. Quality system requirements can impact all phases in the medical device life span,including approval of the device. Applicable requirements depend on the risk class of thedevice and on the regulatory system of the country. 230 9. Pricing The Group's activities are subject to price control laws and regulations in some of the markets in which it operates. The range and extent of these requirements vary by market. In China, prices are mainly determined by a mix of regulations and market competition. In respect of medicines (both Rx and OTC) in the hospital channel, the government regulatesprices through a centralised procurement mechanism, medical insurance reimbursementstandards and strengthened regulation of medical and pricing practices. In November 2018, China introduced a national volume-based procurement pilot programme for medicines that are sold in the hospital channel in which companies submit bids for severalgeneric drugs, with the winners gaining a guaranteed sale volume of the total market for thosedrugs for 1-3 years. Since 2019, this pilot programme has been expanded nationwide and alsoincludes a provincial volume-based procurement programme that allows provincialgovernments to include drugs that are outside the national volume-based procurement scope. Outside the hospital channel, some medicine prices are indirectly managed by certain policies. In certain cities, such as Shanghai and Nanjing, retail prices are indirectly affected by volume-based procurement and price control policies, such that the prices are to varying degreeslinked to the hospital channel bidding prices. In many other provinces retail pharmacies can setprices freely but with an upper limit to reimbursement. 10. Environment and health and safety The Group's operations, like those of other healthcare companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing processes and, assuch, the Group is subject to numerous local, national and international environmentalprotection and health and safety laws and regulations. Environmental laws are complex,frequently amended and have generally become more stringent over time. Certain environmental laws impose strict (i.e. may be imposed regardless of fault) and joint and several liability on current or previous owners of real property and current or previous ownersor operators of facilities for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardoussubstances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed ofhazardous substances. These laws may require that the Group reimburses the government forcosts incurred at these sites or otherwise pays for the cost of investigation and clean-up ofthese sites, including compensation for damage to natural resources. In addition, the Group is subject to increasingly extensive reporting obligations in respect of its relationship with the environment and climate change. These include, among others, reportingrequirements under the framework of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures,as well as legislation in relation to Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting. Disclosure andreporting requirements in relation to wider ESG matters are also increasingly extensive andsubject to greater regulatory scrutiny. For example, the Group must comply with the ModernSlavery Act 2015 and make specific disclosures on its engagement with stakeholders,including employees. The Group must also comply with applicable safety laws to protect employees against occupational injuries. Under such laws, employers typically must establish and maintainworking conditions and workplaces that effectively prevent danger to employees. In particular, 231 employers must comply with certain medical and hygiene standards and meet certain health and safety requirements at work, such as carrying out risk assessments and implementingmeasures for the safety of employees. 11. ABAC, AML and sanctions The Group is required to comply with applicable anti-bribery and corruption (\" ABAC \"), anti- money laundering (\" AML \") and sanctions regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates. These include, among others, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977, the UK Bribery Act2010, the UK Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on thePayer) Regulations 2017, and the China Criminal Law of the PRC 2020. Additionally, in certainjurisdictions, the Group's engagement with healthcare professionals and other external leadersis subject to applicable restrictions. For example, in the USA, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remunerationintended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and servicescovered by government healthcare programmes or reward past purchases orrecommendations. 12. Data privacy USAIn the USA, the Group is subject to a range of consumer privacy laws, whose specific requirements vary from state to state. For example, in California, the Group is subject to theCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\" CCPA \"). The CCPA requires businesses to comply with various requirements relating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal informationof California consumers. Notably, the CCPA grants consumers the right to opt-out of the sale oftheir personal information by businesses. \"Selling\" is defined broadly to include almost anytransfer of personal information to a third party for valuable consideration, including throughintra-group transfers. Businesses are required to have a \"do not sell my personal information\"button available to consumers on their website homepage, and consumers must be givenexplicit notice when their personal information is sold. Companies subject to the CCPA mustalso create and publish a privacy policy that discloses: (i) the categories of personalinformation the business collects; (ii) the sources(s) from which the personal information iscollected; and (iii) the purpose for which the personal information is collected and/or sold. TheCCPA has been amended by the California Privacy Rights Act 2020 (\" CPRA \"), which will come into effect in 2023. The CPRA expands consumer privacy rights and includes an opt-out forany sharing of personal data for cross-contextual behavioural advertising, whereby businessestrack consumer behaviour across unaffiliated websites and use the data collected foradvertising purposes. Virginia, Colorado and Utah have also passed similar comprehensiveprivacy laws, and several more states may join them in the coming months. Like CPRA, theVirginia, Colorado and Utah laws each include a provision allowing consumers to, among otherthings, opt out of the use of their personal information for purposes of online tracking andtargeted advertising. These comprehensive privacy laws are in addition to an existing set ofmulti-state laws requiring notification in cases of personal data breach. EU and UKBoth the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR regulate the processing of the personal data of living individuals (\" data subjects \") by, among others: (i) companies that collect or receive personal data and control the use of that data (\" data controllers \"); and (ii) companies that process 232 personal data on behalf of data controllers (\" data processors \"). The Group is a data controller and is required to comply with both the EU GDPR (as the Group carries out certain activities inthe EU) and the UK GDPR. According to the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, personal data includes any information relating to data subjects who can be identified from that information. It can therefore include: personaldetails such as name, address, email address, telephone number and date of birth; informationrelating to the individual, whether in their personal, family or professional life; and anyexpression of opinion about an individual or indications of a company's (or any other person's)intentions in respect of that individual; and it includes persistent online identifiers such as IPaddress, machine ID and other technical data that can be tied to an individual. The processingof personal data covers any activity done to or in relation to the personal data. In addition, tothe extent a company processes, controls or otherwise uses \"special category\" personal data(including individuals' health or medical information, genetic information and biometricinformation), more stringent rules apply, further limiting the circumstances and the manner inwhich a company is legally permitted to process that data. EU GDPR and UK GDPR entail strict requirements, including with respect to (i) international data transfers, (ii) data mapping and accountability obligations, (iii) the involvement of a dataprocessor, (iv) the appointment of a data protection officer, (v) data subjects' rights (e.g.,notices, right to data portability and right to be forgotten), (vi) the need to carry out a dataprivacy impact assessment regarding data processing activities using new technologies likelyto result in a high risk to the rights and freedom of natural persons, and (vii) notificationobligations in case of a data breach. There are costs and administrative burdens associated with compliance with the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR. Any failure or perceived failure to comply carries with it the risk ofsignificant penalties and sanctions, of up to \u00a317.5 million or 4 per cent. of global turnover forfailure to comply with UK GDPR and up to \u20ac20 million or 4 per cent. of global turnover for failure to comply with EU GDPR. In addition, the EU is in the process of agreeing a new e-Privacy Regulation (\" ePR\"), which will replace the e-Privacy Directive. This will be directly implemented in the laws of each MemberState without the need for further enactment and it is conceivable that the UK will also consideralignment. The draft ePR imposes new rules around, among other areas, confidentiality ofonline communications, the use of cookies and direct marketing. EU regulators recently havefocused attention on advertising technologies that track user behaviour and serve ads basedon online activities and profiles. These initiatives will increase the regulatory burden in respectof certain business activities including, in particular, the way a business conducts onlineresearch, and online marketing and advertising activities, including efforts to understand users'internet usage and online purchasing habits. ChinaIn China, the Group is also subject to a range of data privacy and security regulations, including the Personal Information Protection Law 2021, the Cybersecurity Law 2016 and theData Security Law 2021. Such data regulations have a significant impact on the processing ofdata in China, as well as the cost of dedicated systems, teams and infrastructure that may berequired for businesses to comply. The Personal Information Protection Law 2021 is the first comprehensive legislation on personal information protection in China. It specifies the scope of personal information, clarifies 233 the legal bases for processing personal information, lays down the obligations and responsibilities imposed on data processors and imposes stringent requirements on datalocalisation. Consequences of non-compliance may include monetary fines of up to 5 per cent.of the previous year's turnover, termination of data transfers and personal liability imposed onthose directly responsible. The Group must also comply with the Cybersecurity Law 2016, which requires the establishment of internal security management systems that meet the requirements of aclassified protection system for cyber security. This includes: appointing dedicated cybersecurity personnel; taking technical measures to prevent computer viruses, network attacksand intrusions; taking technical measures to monitor and record network operation status andcyber security incidents; and adopting data security measures, such as data classification,back-ups and encryption. Where facilities are deemed to be part of China's \"critical informationinfrastructure\", the Cybersecurity Law sets high requirements for operational security, includingdata localisation and national security review requirements for any products or services thatmay impact national security. The Data Security Law 2021 regulates core state data and other important data. It sets out requirements for data security management and requires that security assessment reports aresubmitted to regulators. In addition, it prohibits an entity from providing any such data stored inChina to a foreign judicial or law enforcement agency without the approval of the relevantChinese regulator. Penalties for non-compliance may include monetary fines, cessation ofbusiness and revocation of business licences. 234 PART XI TAXATION Part A: United Kingdom TaxationThe following paragraphs are intended only as a general guide to current UK tax law and HMRC's current published practice (which may not be binding on HMRC) as at the date of this Prospectus,which are both subject to change at any time, possibly with retrospective effect. All rates andallowances referenced below are those currently in force. Furthermore, they are not exhaustive andrelate only to certain limited aspects of the UK tax consequences for Haleon Shareholders of holding ordisposing of Haleon Shares. Except where expressly stated otherwise, the paragraphs below are intended to apply only to Haleon Shareholders: (a) who are for UK tax purposes resident and, if individuals, domiciled or deemeddomiciled in (and only in) the United Kingdom for UK tax purposes; (b) to whom split-year treatmentdoes not apply; (c) who are the absolute beneficial owners of their Haleon Shares and any dividendspaid in respect of them; and (d) who hold their Haleon Shares as investments (otherwise than throughan individual savings account or an exempt pension arrangement or as carried interest) and not assecurities to be realised in the course of a trade. The paragraphs below may not apply to certain shareholders, such as charities, dealers in securities, trustees, broker dealers, market makers, insurance companies and collective investment schemes,pension schemes, persons subject to UK tax on the remittance basis, persons who are otherwiseexempt from UK taxation and persons who have (or are deemed to have) acquired their Haleon Sharesby virtue of an office or employment or persons who are treated as holding their Haleon Shares ascarried interest. Such shareholders may be subject to special rules. The material set out in the paragraphs below does not constitute tax advice. Any person who is in any doubt as to their tax position or who is or may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction otherthan the United Kingdom should consult an appropriate professional adviser. Investors shouldbe aware that the tax legislation of the investor's jurisdiction and/or the tax legislation of theUnited Kingdom may have an impact on the income received from the Haleon Shares. 1. Direct taxation of dividends on the Haleon Shares (A) UK withholding tax The Company will not be required to withhold tax at source from dividend payments it makes. (B) Individual Haleon Shareholders within the charge to UK income tax The general tax treatment of dividends paid by the Company to individual Haleon Shareholders is as follows: \u0081 dividends received by an individual Haleon Shareholder from the Company (or from other sources) will form part of the Haleon Shareholder's total income forincome tax purposes; \u0081 a nil rate of income tax applies to the first part of taxable dividend income received by an individual Haleon Shareholder in a tax year (the \" Nil Rate Amount \"), regardless of the tax rate that would otherwise apply. For the tax year from 6 April2022 to 5 April 2023, the Nil Rate Amount is \u00a32,000; and 235 \u0081 any taxable dividend income received by an individual Haleon Shareholder in a tax year in excess of the Nil Rate Amount will be taxed at the rates set out below. Where a Haleon Shareholder's taxable dividend income for a tax year exceeds the Nil Rate Amount, the excess amount (the \" Relevant Dividend Income \") will, subject to the availability of any income tax personal allowance, be subject to income tax, at thefollowing rates for the 2022/2023 tax year: \u0081 8.75 per cent., to the extent that the Relevant Dividend Income falls below the threshold for the higher rate of income tax; \u0081 33.75 per cent., to the extent that the Relevant Dividend Income falls above the threshold for the higher rate of income tax but below the threshold for theadditional rate of income tax; and \u0081 39.35 per cent., to the extent that the Relevant Dividend Income falls above the threshold for the additional rate of income tax. In determining whether and, if so, to what extent the Relevant Dividend Income falls above or below the threshold for the higher rate of income tax or, as the case may be,the additional rate of income tax, the Haleon Shareholder's total taxable dividendincome for the tax year in question (including the part within the Nil Rate Amount) willbe treated as the highest part of the Haleon Shareholder's total income for income taxpurposes. (C) Corporate Haleon Shareholders within the charge to UK corporation tax Haleon Shareholders within the charge to UK corporation tax which are \"small companies\" (for the purposes of Chapter 2 of Part 9A of the Corporation Tax Act 2009)will not generally be subject to UK corporation tax on any dividend received from theCompany on the Haleon Shares, provided certain conditions are met. Other Haleon Shareholders within the charge to UK corporation tax will be subject to UK corporation tax on dividends received from the Company on the Haleon Shares,unless the dividends fall within an exempt class and certain conditions are met. Ingeneral: (a) dividends paid on non-redeemable shares that do not carry any present orfuture preferential rights to dividends or to the company's assets on its winding up, and(b) dividends paid to a person holding less than 10 per cent. of the issued share capitalof the payer (or, if there is more than one class of share, the same class of that sharecapital in respect of which the dividends are paid) and who is entitled to less than10 per cent. of the profits available for distribution to holders of the same class ofshares and would be entitled to less than 10 per cent. of the assets available fordistribution to holders of the same class of shares on a winding-up, are examples ofdividends that fall within an exempt class, subject to certain targeted and general anti-avoidance rules. 2. Chargeable gains (A) Individuals A disposal or deemed disposal of Haleon Shares may give rise to a chargeable gain (or allowable loss) for the purposes of UK capital gains tax, depending upon theHaleon Shareholder's circumstances and subject to any available exemption or relief. 236 A capital gains tax annual exemption (which is \u00a312,300 for individuals in the 2022/2023 tax year) may, however, be available to the extent it has not already been utilised bythe individual Haleon Shareholder. The rate of capital gains tax on share disposals (after taking advantage of the annual exemption and deducting any allowable capital losses) is currently 10 per cent. to theextent that individuals are subject to income tax at the basic rate and any chargeablegain does not exceed the unused part of their basic rate income tax band. Where anindividual is subject to income tax at the basic rate but any chargeable gain exceedsthe unused part of their basic rate income tax band, the rate of capital gains tax on theexcess is 20 per cent. The rate of capital gains tax is also 20 per cent. for individualswho are subject to income tax at the higher or additional rates. (B) Companies A disposal or deemed disposal of Haleon Shares may give rise to a chargeable gain (or allowable loss) for the purposes of UK corporation tax, depending on thecircumstances and subject to any available exemption or relief. Corporation tax ischarged on chargeable gains at the rate of corporation tax applicable to that company. (C) Capital Reduction The Capital Reduction should be treated as a reorganisation of the Company's share capital. The effect of this should be that a Haleon Shareholder's resultant holding ofHaleon Shares following the Capital Reduction should be treated as the same asset,acquired at the same time and for the same consideration, as the holding of HaleonShares held by that Haleon Shareholder immediately prior to the Capital Reduction.Haleon Shareholders therefore should not be treated as having made a disposal for thepurposes of UK tax on chargeable gains. 3. UK Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (\"SDRT\") The following statements are intended as a general and non-exhaustive guide to the current UK stamp duty and SDRT position and apply regardless of whether or not a HaleonShareholder is resident in the United Kingdom. It should be noted that certain categories ofperson, including market makers, brokers, dealers, persons connected with clearance servicesand depositary receipt systems and other specified market intermediaries, may not be liable tostamp duty or SDRT or may be liable at a higher rate or may, although not primarily liable fortax, be required to notify and account for it under the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax Regulations1986. (A) General A sale of Haleon Shares will generally be subject to UK stamp duty (if the Haleon Shares are held in certificated form) or SDRT (if the sale is settled electronicallythrough the UK's CREST system of paperless transfers), in either case at the rate of0.5 per cent. of the amount or value of the consideration paid for the Haleon Shares.Transfers of Haleon Shares to a connected company of a Haleon Shareholder (or itsnominee) may be subject to stamp duty and/or SDRT based on the market value of theHaleon Shares at the time of the transfer, if that is higher than the amount or value ofthe consideration actually paid for the Haleon Shares, subject to any relief which maybe available for intragroup transfers. 237 Any stamp duty payable (as opposed to SDRT) is rounded up to the nearest \u00a35. No stamp duty (as opposed to SDRT) will be payable if the amount or value of theconsideration is (and is certified on the instrument of transfer to be) \u00a31,000 or underand the transfer does not form part of a larger transaction, or series of transactions,where the aggregate consideration exceeds \u00a31,000. In practice, only one of eitherstamp duty or SDRT would be paid and is usually paid or borne by the purchaser. (B) Depositary receipt issuers and clearance services Stamp duty and SDRT may arise upon the deposit of an underlying Haleon Share with a depositary receipt issuer, generally at the higher rate of 1.5 per cent. of the issueprice or, as the case may be, of the amount or value of the consideration for or, incertain circumstances, the value of the transfer. Following litigation, however, HMRChave confirmed that they will no longer seek to apply the 1.5 per cent. SDRT charge onan issue of shares to a depositary receipt issuer or to a person providing clearanceservices (or their nominee or agent) on the basis that this is not compatible with EUlaw. HMRC's published view is that this remains the position under the terms of theEuropean Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 following the end of the transition period unlessthe stamp taxes on shares legislation is amended. HMRC's view is that the 1.5 percent. SDRT or stamp duty charge will continue to apply to a transfer of shares orsecurities to a depositary receipt system or clearance service where the transfer is notan integral part of an issue of share capital. Based on HMRC's published practice, no stamp duty will be payable on the acquisition or transfer of depositary receipts. Furthermore, an agreement to transfer depositaryreceipts will not give rise to a liability to SDRT. Special rules, which are similar in many respects to those described above in relation to depositary receipt systems, apply to the issue or transfer of shares to a clearanceservice (and to transfers of shares within a clearance service). Part B: US TaxationUnited States Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsThe following is a summary of material US federal income tax considerations generally applicable to US Holders (as defined below) of owning and disposing of the Haleon Shares. This summary is based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \" Code \"), and regulations, rulings and judicial interpretations thereof, in force as of the date hereof, and theConvention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of theUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and thePrevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, in force as of31 March 2003 (as amended by any subsequent protocols, including the protocol in force as of31 March 2003) (the \" Treaty \"). Those authorities may be changed at any time, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in US federal income tax consequences different from those summarised below. This summary is directed only to US Holders that hold their Haleon Shares as capital assets and does not address particular tax consequences that may be applicable to US Holders who may be subject tospecial tax rules, such as US Holders of Haleon ADSs, banks, brokers or dealers in securities orcurrencies, traders in securities electing to mark to market, financial institutions, life insurancecompanies, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, entities or arrangements that aretreated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes (or partners therein), holders that own or 238 are treated as owning 10 per cent. or more of the Company's stock by vote or value, persons holding ordinary shares as part of a hedging or conversion transaction or a straddle, or persons whosefunctional currency is not the USD. Moreover, this summary does not address state, local or foreigntaxes, the US federal estate and gift taxes, the Medicare contribution tax applicable to net investmentincome of certain non-corporate US Holders, or alternative minimum tax consequences of acquiring,holding or disposing of ordinary shares. For purposes of this summary, a \"US Holder\" is a beneficial owner of Haleon Shares that is a citizen or resident of the United States or a US domestic corporation or that otherwise is subject to US federalincome taxation on a net income basis in respect of such Haleon Shares. You should consult your own tax advisors about the consequences to you of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Haleon Shares, including the relevance to your particularsituation of the considerations discussed below and any consequences arising under foreign,state, local or other tax laws. US Federal Income Tax Consequences of Owning and Disposing of Haleon Shares Received in the Demerger Taxation of DividendsSubject to the discussion below under \" Passive Foreign Investment Company Status ,\" the gross amount of any distribution of cash or property with respect to Haleon Shares that is paid out of theCompany's current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal income taxpurposes) will generally be includible in a US Holder's taxable income as ordinary dividend income onthe day on which the US Holder receives the dividend and will not be eligible for the dividends-receiveddeduction allowed to corporations under the Code. The Company does not expect to maintain calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance with US federal income tax principles. US Holders therefore should expect that distributions generally willbe reported as dividends for US federal income tax purposes. Dividends paid in Pounds Sterling generally will be includible in the US Holder's income in a USD amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the day the dividends are distributed.Any gain or loss on a subsequent sale, conversion or other disposition of such non-US currency bysuch US Holder generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be income orloss from sources within the United States. Subject to certain exceptions for short-term positions, the USD amount of dividends received by an individual with respect to Haleon Shares will be subject to taxation at a preferential rate if the dividendsare \"qualified dividends.\" Dividends paid on Haleon Shares will be treated as qualified dividends if: \u0081 the Company is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States that the US Treasury determines is satisfactory for purposes of this provision andthat includes an exchange of information program; and \u0081 the Company was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company (a\"PFIC \"). The US Treasury has determined that the Treaty meets the requirements for reduced rates of taxation, and the Company believes it is eligible for the benefits of the Treaty. The Company was not treated as 239 a corporation for US federal income tax purposes for its 2021 taxable year, and thus the PFIC rules were not applicable to the Company for such year. In addition, based on the Company's auditedfinancial statements and its current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, and thesources and nature of its income, it does not anticipate becoming a PFIC for its 2022 taxable year or inthe foreseeable future. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of thereduced dividend tax rate in light of their own particular circumstances. Dividend distributions with respect to Haleon Shares generally will be treated as \"passive category\" income from sources outside the United States for purposes of determining a US Holder's US foreigntax credit limitation. Taxation of Dispositions of Haleon SharesSubject to the discussion below under \" Passive Foreign Investment Company Status ,\" upon a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the Haleon Shares, a US Holder will realise gain or loss forUS federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realised onthe disposition and the US Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares, as determined in USD asdiscussed below. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will generally be long-term capitalgain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Long-term capital gain realised by aUS Holder that is an individual generally is subject to taxation at a preferential rate. The deductibility ofcapital losses is subject to limitations. Gain, if any, realised by a US Holder on the sale or other disposition of the shares generally will be treated as US source income for US foreign tax credit purposes. If a US Holder sells or otherwise disposes of Haleon Shares in exchange for currency other than USD, the amount realised generally will be the USD value of the currency received at the spot rate in effecton the date of sale or other disposition (or, if the shares are traded on an established securities marketat such time, in the case of cash basis and electing accrual basis US Holders, the settlement date). Anaccrual basis US Holder that does not elect to determine the amount realised using the spot exchangerate on the settlement date will recognise foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference betweenthe USD value of the amount received based on the spot exchange rates in effect on the date of thesale or other disposition and the settlement date. A US Holder generally will have a tax basis in thecurrency received equal to the USD value of the currency received at the spot rate in effect on thesettlement date. Any currency gain or loss realised on the settlement date or the subsequent sale,conversion, or other disposition of the non-US currency received for a different USD amount generallywill be US-source ordinary income or loss, and will not be eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable tolong-term capital gains. If an accrual basis US Holder makes the election described in the firstsentence of this paragraph, it must be applied consistently from year to year and cannot be revokedwithout the consent of the IRS. A US Holder should consult its own tax advisors regarding thetreatment of any foreign currency gain or loss realised with respect to any currency received in a saleor other disposition of the shares. Capital ReductionIt is not clear whether the Capital Reduction would be treated as a realisation event for US federal income tax purposes, although even if the Capital Reduction were to be treated as such a realisationevent, the Company intends for the Capital Reduction to qualify as tax-free under sections 368(a)(1)(E)and/or 1036 of the Code. Assuming that the Capital Reduction qualifies for tax-free treatment, (i) a USHolder will not recognise any gain or loss upon the Capital Reduction, and (ii) the US Holder'saggregate adjusted basis and holding period in the US Holder's Haleon Shares should be the same asthe US Holder's aggregate basis and holding period in the Haleon Shares exchanged therefor. US 240 Holders that acquired their Haleon Shares on different dates and at different prices should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of the tax basis of such shares. Passive Foreign Investment Company Status Special US tax rules apply to companies that are considered to be PFICs. The Company will be classified as a PFIC in a particular taxable year if, taking into account its proportionate share of theincome and assets of its subsidiaries under applicable \"look-through\" rules, either: \u0081 75 per cent. or more of its gross income for the taxable year is passive income; or\u0081 the average percentage of the value of its assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income is at least 50 per cent. For this purpose, passive income generally includes dividends, interest, gains from certain commodities transactions, rents, royalties and the excess of gains over losses from the disposition ofassets that produce passive income. The Company does not expect to become a PFIC in 2022 or the foreseeable future. However, the PFIC tests must be applied each year, and it is possible that the Company may become a PFIC in afuture year. In the event that, contrary to the Company's expectation, the Company is classified as aPFIC in any year, a US Holder generally would be subject to additional taxes on certain distributionsand any gain realised from the sale or other taxable disposition of Haleon Shares regardless ofwhether the Company continued to be a PFIC in any subsequent year, unless such US Holder electsto mark their Haleon Shares to market for tax purposes on an annual basis. US Holders areencouraged to consult their own tax advisor as to the Company's status as a PFIC and the taxconsequences to the US Holder of such status. Foreign Financial Asset Reporting Individual US Holders that own \"specified foreign financial assets\" with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 on the last day of the taxable year or $75,000 at any time during the taxable year aregenerally required to file an information statement along with their tax returns, currently on Form 8938,with respect to such assets. \"Specified foreign financial assets\" include any financial accounts held at anon-US financial institution, as well as securities issued by a non-US issuer that are not held inaccounts maintained by financial institutions. Higher reporting thresholds apply to certain individualsliving abroad and to certain married individuals. Regulations extend this reporting requirement tocertain entities that are treated as formed or availed of to hold direct or indirect interests in specifiedforeign financial assets based on objective criteria. US Holders who fail to report the requiredinformation could be subject to substantial penalties. In addition, the statute of limitations forassessment of tax would be suspended, in whole or part. Prospective investors are encouraged toconsult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of these rules, including theapplication of the rules to their particular circumstances. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting Dividends paid on, and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, the shares to a US taxpayer generally may be subject to the information reporting requirements of the Code and may be subject tobackup withholding unless the US taxpayer provides an accurate taxpayer identification number andmakes any other required certification or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding isnot an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a US taxpayer will beallowed as a refund or credit against the US taxpayer's US federal income tax liability, provided therequired information is furnished to the US Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner. A holder that is not a US taxpayer may be required to comply with certification and identification procedures in order to establish its exemption from information reporting and backup withholding. 241 PART XII ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 1.

There can be no assurance that Holders or Beneficial Ownersgenerally, or any Holder and/or Beneficial Owner in particular, will be given the opportunity toreceive elective distributions on the same terms and conditions as the holders of ordinaryshares. To the extent the Depositary deems distribution of securities or property available to the Depositary resulting from any distribution on deposited securities (other than cash, ordinaryshares or Rights) not to be equitable and practicable, the Depositary may distribute any USDollars available to the Depositary from net proceeds of sale of such securities or property.

Promptly upon the occurrence of any of the aforementionedchanges affecting deposited securities, the Company shall notify the Depositary in writing ofsuch occurrence and as soon as practicable after receipt of such notice from the Company,may instruct the Depositary to give notice thereof, at the Company's expense, to Holders inaccordance with the provisions hereof. Upon receipt of such instruction, the Depositary shallgive notice to the Holders in accordance with the terms thereof, as soon as reasonablypracticable. 253 For all cash dividends and other cash distributions that are made available to the Depositary after the date that will be published on www.adr.com (as updated by the Depositary from timeto time, \"ADR.com\") and communicated to then current Holders by mail, the Depositary willdistribute any cash to Holders solely via electronic funds transfer, except as otherwise providedin this paragraph. In order to receive such amounts, Holders must provide their bank depositdetails to the Depositary in accordance with the instructions provided by the Depositary for thispurpose. Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, all such amounts owing to Holderswho do not provide such bank deposit details shall be held by the Depositary on behalf of suchHolders until such bank deposit details have been provided. All amounts so held by theDepositary will be reported for tax purposes as if paid to all Holders as of the date that fundsare first made available to Holders and will neither accrue interest nor be invested for Holderswhile they are being held. A Holder will be unable to receive cash dividends or other cashdistributions to which it is entitled until such time as such Holder either (i) provides its bankdeposit details to the Depositary in accordance with the instructions provided by the Depositaryfor this purpose, (ii) transfers such Holder's ADS position into DTC or (iii) cancels its ADSs(whereupon, in the case of a transfer to DTC or a cancellation, such Holder will receive a checkfor the aggregate amount of cash dividends and/or cash distributions being held on its behalf).Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Depositary shall, if instructed by the Company, distributecash dividends and other cash distributions by check or by such other means as the Companyand the Depositary may agree. Foreign exchange related mattersTo facilitate the administration of various depositary receipt transactions, including disbursement of dividends or other cash distributions and other corporate actions, theDepositary may engage the foreign exchange desk within JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the\"Bank \") and/or its affiliates in order to enter into spot foreign exchange transactions to convert foreign currency into US Dollars (\" FX Transactions \"). For certain currencies, FX Transactions are entered into with the Bank or an affiliate, as the case may be, acting in a principal capacity.For other currencies, FX Transactions are routed directly to and managed by an unaffiliatedlocal custodian (or other third party local liquidity provider), and neither the Bank nor any of itsaffiliates is a party to such FX Transactions. The foreign exchange rate applied to an FX Transaction will be either (a) a published benchmark rate, or (b) a rate determined by a third party local liquidity provider, in each caseplus or minus a spread, as applicable. The Depositary will disclose which foreign exchangerate and spread, if any, apply to such currency on ADR.com. Such applicable foreign exchangerate and spread may (and neither the Depositary, the Bank nor any of their affiliates is underany obligation to ensure that such rate does not) differ from rates and spreads at whichcomparable transactions are entered into with other customers or the range of foreignexchange rates and spreads at which the Bank or any of its affiliates enters into foreignexchange transactions in the relevant currency pair on the date of the FX Transaction.Additionally, the timing of execution of an FX Transaction varies according to local marketdynamics, which may include regulatory requirements, market hours and liquidity in the foreignexchange market or other factors. Furthermore, the Bank and its affiliates may manage theassociated risks of their position in the market in a manner they deem appropriate withoutregard to the impact of such activities on the Company, the Depositary, Holders or BeneficialOwners. The spread applied does not reflect any gains or losses that may be earned orincurred by the Bank and its affiliates as a result of risk management or other hedging relatedactivity. To the extent the Company provides US Dollars to the Depositary, neither the Banknor any of its affiliates will execute an FX Transaction. In such case, the Depositary willdistribute the US Dollars received from the Company. Further details relating to the applicable foreign exchange rate, the applicable spread and the execution of FX Transactions will be provided by the Depositary on ADR.com. The Company,Holders and Beneficial Owners each acknowledge and agree that the terms applicable to FXTransactions disclosed from time to time on ADR.com will apply to any FX Transactionexecuted pursuant to the Deposit Agreement. 254 Amendment and termination of the Deposit Agreement The form of ADRs evidencing ADSs and any provisions of the Deposit Agreement relating to those ADRs may be amended by the Company and the Depositary.

Noamendment may impair the right of any Holder to surrender ADRs and receive in return thedeposited securities represented by the ADSs. If any governmental body or regulatory bodyshould adopt new laws, rules or regulations which would require amendment or supplement ofthe Deposit Agreement or the form of ADR to ensure compliance therewith, the Company andthe Depositary may amend or supplement the Deposit Agreement and the ADR at any time inaccordance with such changed laws, rules or regulations.

ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION The Articles of Association of the Company, which were adopted on 31 May 2022, contain (amongst others) provisions to the following effect. 5.1 Unrestricted objects The objects of the Company are unrestricted. 259 5.2 Limited liability The liability of the Haleon Shareholders is limited to the amount, if any, unpaid on the Haleon Shares held by them. 5.3 Share rights Subject to any rights attached to existing Haleon Shares and Non-Voting Preference Shares, the Company may issue shares with such rights and restrictions as the Company may byordinary resolution decide, or (if there is no such resolution or so far as it does not makespecific provision) as the Board may decide. Such rights and restrictions apply as if they wereset out in the Articles of Association. The Company may issue redeemable shares, subject toany rights attached to existing Haleon Shares and the Non-Voting Preference Shares. TheBoard may determine the terms and conditions and the manner of redemption of anyredeemable shares so issued. Such terms and conditions apply to the relevant shares as ifthey were set out in the Articles of Association. 5.4 Voting rights Haleon Shareholders are entitled to vote at a general meeting or class meeting on a poll. Under the Articles of Association, any resolution put to a vote at a general meeting of theCompany shall be decided on a poll. The Companies Act and the Articles of Association of theCompany provide that on a poll every Haleon Shareholder has one vote per Haleon Share heldby them and a Haleon Shareholder may vote in person or by one or more proxies. Where aHaleon Shareholder appoints more than one proxy, the proxies appointed by them takentogether have the same voting rights as the Haleon Shareholder could exercise in person. In the case of joint holders of a Haleon Share the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, is accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other jointholders and, for this purpose, seniority is determined by the order in which the names stand inthe register in respect of the joint holding. Non-Voting Preference Shares do not confer any right to vote at a general meeting. Non-Voting Preference Shareholders are, however, entitled to vote in respect of their Non-VotingPreference Shares at any class meeting of Non-Voting Preference Shareholders. 5.5 Restrictions on voting A Haleon Shareholder is not entitled to vote at any general meeting or class meeting in respect of any Haleon Share held by them if any call or other sum then payable by them in respect ofthat Haleon Share remains unpaid or if that Haleon Shareholder has been served with arestriction notice (as defined in the Articles of Association) after failure to provide the Companywith information concerning interests in those Haleon Shares required to be provided under theCompanies Act. 5.6 Dividends and other distributions The Company may by ordinary resolution from time to time declare dividends not exceeding the amount recommended by the Board. Subject to the Companies Act, the Board may payinterim dividends, and also any fixed rate dividend, whenever the financial position of theCompany, in the opinion of the Board, justifies its payment. If the Board acts in good faith, it isnot liable to holders of Haleon Shares or Non-Voting Preference Shares with preferred or pari passu rights for losses arising from the payment of interim or fixed dividends on other Haleon Shares or Non-Voting Preference Shares. The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of any dividends or other moneys payable in respect of Haleon Shares from a person with a 0.25 per cent. or greater holding, in numberor nominal value, of such shares (in each case, calculated exclusive of any such shares heldas treasury shares) (in this paragraph, a \" 0.25 per cent. interest \") if such a person has been served with a restriction notice (as defined in the Articles of Association) after failure to providethe Company with information concerning interests in those Haleon Shares required to beprovided under the Companies Act. 260 The Non-Voting Preference Shares rank pari passu with all other Non-Voting Preference Shares and have preferential dividend rights ahead of the Haleon Shares, entitling Non-VotingPreference Shareholders to quarterly cumulative dividends at a fixed rate of 9.5 per cent. perannum for a period of five years from the date of the issue of the Non-Voting PreferenceShares, following which the rate shall be reset for each subsequent period of five consecutiveyears at the rate which is equal to the Bank of England base rate prevailing at the time of resetplus 7.5 per cent. Dividends on the Non-Voting Preference Shares which have become dueand payable in accordance with the Articles are required to be approved and paid in full beforeany repurchases or distributions can be made with respect to the Haleon Shares. Except insofar as the rights attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any Haleon Share otherwise provide, all dividends are apportioned and paid pro rata as between the Haleon Sharesaccording to the amounts paid up on the Haleon Share during any portion of the period inrespect of which the dividend is paid. Dividends may be declared or paid in any currency. The Board may, if authorised by an ordinary resolution of the Company, offer Haleon Shareholders (excluding any Haleon Shareholder holding Haleon Shares as treasury shares) inrespect of any dividend the right to elect to receive Haleon Shares by way of scrip dividendinstead of cash. Any dividend unclaimed after a period of six years from the date when it was declared or became due for payment is forfeited and reverts to the Company unless the Board decidesotherwise. The Board may decide on the way dividends or other money payable in cash relating to a Haleon Share are paid, including deciding on different methods of payment for different HaleonShareholders or groups of Haleon Shareholders. If the Board has decided on different methodsof payment, it may also give Haleon Shareholders the option of choosing in which of theseways they would like to receive payment or it may specify that a particular method of paymentwill be used unless Haleon Shareholders choose otherwise. If Haleon Shareholders fail toprovide the necessary details to enable payment of the dividend or other amount payable tothem or if payment cannot be made using the details provided by the Haleon Shareholder, thedividend or other amount payable will be treated as unclaimed. The Company may cease to employ any means of payment, including intra-bank transfers or other electronic means, for dividends if (i) for any one dividend the payment by any method hasfailed (including where the payment has been rejected or refunded) and reasonable enquirieshave failed to establish any new account of the registered holder; or (ii) in respect of anypayments to be made via cheque, any hard copy notice, document or other information servedon or sent or supplied to a member of the Company has been returned to the Companyundelivered and the relevant member has not supplied to the Company (or its agent) a newregistered address, or a postal address within the United Kingdom or the United States for theservice of notices and the despatch or supply of documents and other information. TheCompany must recommence sending dividend payments if the holder or person entitled bytransmission requests such recommencement in writing (and provides any informationreasonably required by the Company to enable it to do so). 5.7 Rights on a winding up The Non-Voting Preference Shares carry preferential rights to participate in a distribution of capital in the event of insolvency (including on a winding-up) up to an amount equal to theirnominal value plus accrued dividend and any arrears or deficiency in amount of the cumulativedividend. The Haleon Shares do not carry any rights to participate in a capital distribution (including on a liquidation) other than those that exist as a matter of law. Under the Companies Act, upon aliquidation, after the claims of creditors have been satisfied and subject to any special rightsattaching to any other class of shares in the Company (including the Non-Voting PreferenceShares), surplus assets (if any) are distributed among the Haleon Shareholders in proportion tothe number and nominal amounts of their Haleon Shares. 261 5.8 Pre-emption rights The rights of Haleon Shareholders to participate pre-emptively in any allotment of equity securities are prescribed by the Companies Act. Under the Companies Act, subject to certainstatutory exceptions, a company proposing to allot equity securities (which includes the grantof rights to subscribe for shares) must first offer them on the same or more favourable terms toeach holder of shares pro rata to their existing shareholding. The statutory pre-emption rightalso applies to a sale of shares that, immediately before the sale, were held by the Companyas treasury shares. The Companies Act allows this statutory pre-emption right to be disappliedby special resolution so that the Directors may allot shares as if the pre-emption provisions didnot apply, either in relation to a general authority to allot shares or in relation to a specifiedallotment of equity securities. The statutory pre-emption regime does not apply to: the allotment or transfer of Haleon Shares under an employees' share scheme; the allotment of bonus shares; or an allotment of equitysecurities that are paid up wholly or partly otherwise than in cash. 5.9 Transfer of shares The Haleon Shares and Non-Voting Preference Shares are in registered form. Any Haleon Share or Non-Voting Preference Share may be held in uncertificated form and, subject to theArticles of Association, title to uncertificated Haleon Shares or Non-Voting Preference Sharesmay be transferred by means of a relevant system. Provisions of the Articles of Association donot apply to any uncertificated Haleon Shares or Non-Voting Preference Shares to the extentthat such provisions are inconsistent with the holding of Haleon Shares or Non-VotingPreference Shares (as applicable) in uncertificated form, with the transfer of Haleon Shares orNon-Voting Preference Shares (as applicable) by means of a relevant system, with anyprovision of the legislation relating to the holding, evidencing of title to, or transfer ofuncertificated shares. Subject to the Articles of Association, any Haleon Shareholder or Non-Voting Preference Shareholder may transfer all or any of their certificated Haleon Shares or Non-VotingPreference Shares by an instrument of transfer in any usual form or in any other form whichthe Board may approve. The instrument of transfer must be signed by or on behalf of thetransferor and (in the case of a partly-paid Haleon Share) the transferee. The transferor of a Haleon Share or Non-Voting Preference Share is deemed to remain the holder until the transferee's name is entered in the register. The Board can decline to register any transfer of any Haleon Share or Non-Voting Preference Share which is not a fully paid Haleon Share or Non-Voting Preference Share. The Board mayalso decline to register a transfer of a certificated Haleon Share or Non-Voting PreferenceShare unless the instrument of transfer: (A) is duly stamped or certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be exempt from stamp duty and is accompanied by the relevant share certificate and suchother evidence of the right to transfer as the Board may reasonably require; (B) is in respect of only one class of Haleon Share or Non-Voting Preference Share; and(C) if to joint transferees, is in favour of not more than four such transferees. Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated Haleon Share or a Non-Voting Preference Share may be refused in the circumstances set out in the uncertificated securities rules (as defined inthe Articles of Association) and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number ofjoint holders to whom the uncertificated Haleon Share or Non-Voting Preference Share (asapplicable) is to be transferred exceeds four. 262 The Board may decline to register a transfer of any of the Company's certificated Haleon Shares by a person with a 0.25 per cent. interest if such a person has been served with arestriction notice (as defined in the Articles of Association) after failure to provide the Companywith information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under theCompanies Act, unless the transfer is shown to the Board to be pursuant to an arm's lengthsale (as defined in the Articles of Association). 5.10 Redemption of Non-Voting Preference Shares Each Non-Voting Preference Share is redeemable in whole at the option of the Company or redeemable at the option of each relevant Non-Voting Preference Shareholder in respect of itsentire holding of Non-Voting Preference Shares on any date falling not less than five yearsafter the date on which that Non-Voting Preference Share was issued or, if earlier, on theCompany undergoing a change of control. Such redemption shall be at the nominal value ofthe relevant Non-Voting Preference Shares plus the amount, if any, of all accrued but unpaiddividends on the Non-Voting Preference Shares. 5.11 Sub-division of share capital Any resolution authorising the Company to sub-divide any of its Haleon Shares may determine that, as between the Haleon Shares resulting from the sub-division, any of them may have apreference, advantage or deferred or other right or be subject to any restriction as comparedwith the others. 5.12 General meetings The Articles of Association rely on the Companies Act provisions dealing with the calling of general meetings. Under the Companies Act an annual general meeting must be called bynotice of at least 21 days. Upon listing, the Company will be a \"traded company\" for thepurposes of the Companies Act and as such will be required to give at least 21 days' notice ofany other general meeting unless a special resolution reducing the period to not less than 14days has been passed at the immediately preceding annual general meeting or at a generalmeeting held since that annual general meeting or, pending the Company's first annual generalmeeting, at any general meeting. Notice of a general meeting must be given in hard copy form,in electronic form, or by means of a website and must be sent to every Haleon Shareholderand every Director. It must state the time and date and the place of the meeting and thegeneral nature of the business to be dealt with at the meeting. As the Company will be a tradedcompany, the notice must also state the website address where information about the meetingcan be found in advance of the meeting, the voting record time, the procedures for attendingand voting at the meeting, details of any forms for appointing a proxy, procedures for voting inadvance (if any are offered), and the right of Haleon Shareholders to ask questions at themeeting. In addition, a notice calling an annual general meeting must state that the meeting isan annual general meeting. The Board may decide to allow persons entitled to attend and participate in a general meeting to do so by simultaneous attendance and participation by means of an electronic facility with nomember necessarily in physical attendance at the electronic meeting, and to permit directors orothers to attend and speak, and the chair of the meeting to preside, by electronic means.Shareholders present in person or by proxy by means of such electronic facility will be countedin the quorum for, and entitled to participate in, the relevant general meeting. 5.13 Restrictions in respect of Designated Persons The Articles of Association contain provisions empowering the Company to apply certain restrictions and to take certain actions in relation to Haleon Shares and Non-Voting PreferenceShares (\" Restricted Shares \") where the Company believes the holder of such shares is or may be a Designated Person (a \" Restricted Person \"). 263 In respect of any Restricted Shares: (A) all of the rights attaching to the Restricted Shares, including (but not limited to) any rights to attend and vote at general meetings of the Company, rights to receive dividends andother distributions from the Company and to otherwise participate in the assets of theCompany (including on a winding up) are suspended and cease to have effect; (B) no interest accrues on any dividend (or capital return) paid to the Company's shareholders generally but withheld from the Restricted Person in accordance withsub-paragraph (A); (C) the directors of the Company are entitled to take steps to ensure that any Restricted Shares held in uncertificated form are immediately converted into certificated form, andthat any Restricted Shares held in certificated form are not converted intouncertificated form; (D) the Restricted Person is prohibited from disposing of the Restricted Shares or any legal or beneficial interest in any of them without the prior written consent of theCompany; and (E) the Company may, on giving written notice to the relevant Restricted Person, authorise any director of the Company or the company secretary (who are deemed to beappointed as the Restricted Person's attorney) to transfer the Restricted Shares to asubsidiary undertaking of the Company (a \" Restricted Share Trustee \") to hold on trust for the Restricted Person on the terms set out in the Articles of Association. The restrictions described above will apply to any Restricted Shares held by a Restricted Person unless and until the directors are satisfied that the Restricted Person has ceased to bea Designated Person (a \" Released Person \"). Any person whose shares in the Company are Restricted Shares and who believes that they have ceased to be a Designated Person maygive written notice to the Company confirming that they believe that they have ceased to be aDesignated Person and the date(s) on which such change became effective (a \" Release Notice \"). However, the decision as to whether and when a person's shares cease to be Restricted Shares is ultimately a decision for the directors (at their sole discretion); thedirectors do not have to receive a Release Notice, for example, before determining that aRestricted Person has become a Released Person. 87 If at any time the directors determine that a Restricted Person has become a Released Person,the restrictions described above will cease to apply in respect of that person's shares withimmediate effect from the time of such determination and the Company is required, as soon asreasonably practicable and if applicable, to: (i) procure that any Restricted Shares convertedinto certificated form are converted back into uncertificated form; (ii) pay, without interest, tothe Released Person or their nominee (provided that such nominee is not itself a DesignatedPerson) any moneys relating to the Released Person's shares which were withheld from theReleased Person while their shares in the Company were Restricted Shares; and (iii) procurethat the legal title to any Restricted Shares transferred to a Restricted Share Trustee isreturned to the Released Person or their nominee (provided that such nominee is not itself aDesignated Person). 87In order to assist the directors with this determination, the registrar and/or another independent adviser to the Company will routinely review the register of members and section 808 register of beneficial ownership against the sanctions lists using amarket-standard screening software. In addition, the register of members and section 808 register of beneficial ownership willbe screened against the sanctions lists as at the record date of any dividend. Additional screening will be carried out as andwhen the Company and its advisers think it is necessary. If the Company receives a Release Notice from a DesignatedPerson, the Company would verify that such person is no longer a Designated Person by checking against the sanctions lists. 264 6.

In accordance with those 'good leaver' rules, in relation to awards held by Directors and Senior Managers under GSK's 'Share Value Plan', the 2020 award and two thirds of the 2021 awardwill vest earlier than initially scheduled. Applying the equivalent rules for awards held byDirectors and Senior Managers under GSK's 'Performance Share Plan', the 2020 award will berounded up (as if employment with GSK had continued until the end of 2022) and will vest,subject to performance, in the first quarter of 2023, and two thirds of the 2021 award will vest,subject to performance, in the first quarter of 2023.

All long-term incentive grants over Haleon Shares awarded or vesting following the Demerger, including refill awards, will be under the governance of, and subject to the approval of, theRemuneration Committee. Participants in GSK's all-employee Share Save and Share Reward Plans will be treated in accordance with the normal rules for 'good leavers' under those plans.

(2) Brian McNamara's benefits included international assignment related costs, healthcare cover, life assurance cover, personal financial advice, a car allowance and other expenses; forBrian McNamara's future taxable benefits arrangements, see summary of the directors'remuneration policy in paragraph 9.4 of this Part XII (Additional Information). (3) Share-based payments for Brian McNamara and Tobias Hestler in respect of their vested long-term incentive awards, and for Vindi Banga and Dame Vivienne Cox include sharesreceived as all or part of their fees. 9.4 Remuneration policy The Company's strategy is to establish a directors' remuneration policy that: \u0081 drives the success of Haleon and the delivery of its business strategy for the benefit of consumers and other key stakeholders; \u0081 creates shareholder value;\u0081 provides an appropriately competitive package to attract, retain and motivate executive talent for a standalone consumer goods business, which will source talentglobally; and \u0081 is aligned with the Company's business priorities, culture, wider workforce pay policies, and best practice. Consistent with this strategy, overall remuneration packages for the Executive Directors have been set at levels that are considered by the Board (having taken independent advice) to beappropriate for the size and nature of the business following Admission. The information below and in paragraphs 9.1 and 9.2 above, together with the details of the share-based incentive plans set out in paragraphs 10.1 to 10.7 of this Part XII ( Additional Information ), summarises the key components of the Executive Director and Non-Executive Director remuneration arrangements which will apply from Admission. The Company's remuneration policies and processes are fully compliant with all regulatory requirements and may be amended from time to time to ensure continued compliance withthese requirements. The Company will formally propose a directors' remuneration policy for approval by Haleon Shareholders at the first annual general meeting of the Company following Admission, inaccordance with section 439A of the Companies Act 2006 and regulations set out in the Largeand Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (asamended). It is currently intended that, if approved, that policy will apply for three years fromthe date of that annual general meeting. 277 That policy will allow implementation of the remuneration strategy through a combination of base salary, benefits, pensions, annual bonus, long-term incentives, and all-employee shareplans. A summary of the key terms of the directors' remuneration policy that will operate from Admission until the shareholder-approved directors' remuneration policy is put in place isprovided below. (A) Base Salary Base salaries for Executive Directors are set at a level appropriate to secure and retain high calibre individuals needed to deliver Haleon's strategic priorities. Upon Admission, the basesalaries will be \u00a31,250,000 for the CEO and \u00a3700,000 for the CFO respectively. The CEO'ssalary level takes into account the fact that he will be localised onto a UK contract and that hisprior remuneration package included international assignment benefits and a US pension, bothof which end under the new arrangement. The individual's role, experience and performance, and independently sourced data for relevant comparator groups, will be considered when determining salary levels. There is no formal maximum limit and, ordinarily, salary increases will be broadly in line with the average increases for the wider Haleon workforce. However, increases may be higher toreflect a change in the scope of the individual's role, responsibilities or experience. Salaryadjustments may also reflect wider market conditions in the geography in which the individualoperates. In line with market practice, the Remuneration Committee will review directors' base salaries annually with the next review scheduled for 2023 and with any increase normally taking effectfrom 1 April. (B) Benefits Executive Directors are eligible to receive benefits in line with the policy for other employees which may vary by location. These include, but are not limited to, private healthcare (includingeligibility for the Executive Director's spouse or partner and eligible dependent children), lifeassurance/death in service benefit, membership of a Group Income Protection plan, personaltax and financial planning, and any contractual post-retirement benefits. The ExecutiveDirectors are also entitled to car travel or a car allowance and the CEO is eligible to receivehome security services. Other benefits include expenses properly incurred in the ordinarycourse of business, which are deemed to be taxable benefits on the individual. The ExecutiveDirectors also benefit from the indemnity provided by the Company in the form provided to allDirectors. In line with the policy for other employees, Executive Directors may be eligible to receive overseas relocation allowances and international transfer-related benefits when appropriate. To facilitate Brian McNamara's employment arrangements being moved from an international assignee package to a standard, local market, basis, a one-off payment of \u00a3300,000 (subject todeductions for tax and National Insurance contributions) will be made to him in 2022. Executive Directors in the UK are also eligible to participate in any all-employee share schemes established by the Haleon Group, on the same terms as other employees. Benefit provision is tailored to reflect market practice in the geography in which the Executive Director is based and different policies may apply if current or future Executive Directors arebased in a different country. 278 (C) Pension arrangements The approach to pensions arrangements for Executive Directors is in line with the broader workforce. In the United Kingdom, Executive Directors will receive their pensions entitlementsfrom the date of their appointment. Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Haleon Group's defined contribution pension plan in the United Kingdom, with the employee contributing a core amount equal to2 per cent. of their base salary and GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Overseas Limitedcontributing a core amount equal to 7 per cent. of their base salary and matching additionalemployee contributions up to 3 per cent. of their base salary (subject to any relevant cap ontax-advantaged contributions and in line with implementation principles for other members ofthe pension plan). To the extent that any such cap applies, or where the Executive Directordoes not participate in the Haleon Group's defined contribution pension plan, GlaxoSmithKlineConsumer Healthcare Overseas Limited's contribution of 7 per cent. of base salary not paidinto that pension plan will be paid to that Executive Director as a cash allowance in lieu of therelevant part of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Overseas Limited's contributions tothat pension plan. (D) Annual bonus Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Haleon plc Annual Incentive Plan which is intended to incentivise and recognise execution of the business strategy on an annual basis. Executive Directors are required to defer 50 per cent. of any bonus earned into an award over Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs under the Haleon plc Deferred Annual Bonus Plan 2022 (the\"DABP \"), which will normally vest on the third anniversary of grant. The bonus opportunities for on-target performance are 100 per cent. of base salary for each of the CEO and the CFO. The maximum bonus opportunities for outstanding performance are twotimes target. Performance measures are based on a combination of financial targets and individual and business objectives, with the weighting of measures determined by the RemunerationCommittee each year according to business priorities. The Remuneration Committee may apply judgement in making appropriate adjustments to bonus outcomes (either up or down) to ensure they reflect underlying business performance. The proportion of any bonus satisfied in cash will be subject to the malus and clawback provisions summarised in paragraph 9.4(I) of this Part XII ( Additional Information ). The period during which any cash award may be recovered will be two years from the date the relevantbonus is paid. The proportion of any bonus deferred into a DABP Award will be subject to theleaver and malus and clawback provisions summarised in paragraph 9.4(I) of this Part XII(Additional Information ). (E) Long-term incentives The Board has adopted the Haleon plc Performance Share Plan 2022 (the \" PSP \"), conditional on Admission. Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the PSP, which is intended toincentivise and recognise delivery of longer-term business priorities, financial growth andincreases in shareholder value. Under the PSP, awards will be in the form of conditional share awards or nil-cost options. It is the Remuneration Committee's current intention that the normal maximum awards that may begranted under the PSP in respect of any financial year are 450 per cent. of salary for the CEOand 350 per cent. of salary for the CFO. 279 These awards to Executive Directors will be subject to performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee. Further details of performance conditions and weightings will be setout in the first Directors' Remuneration Report. It is envisaged that awards will be granted annually to Executive Directors under the PSP and will have a three-year performance period and a further post-vesting two-year holding period. The Remuneration Committee may adjust the formulaic vesting outcome (either up or down) to ensure that the overall outcome reflects underlying business performance over the vestingperiod. Awards are eligible for dividend equivalent payments in respect of dividends that would have been paid on the Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs that vest under the PSP Awards up to thedate the awards vest (or to the end of any relevant post-vesting holding period). A PSP Award will be subject to the leaver and malus and clawback provisions summarised in paragraph 9.4(I) of this Part XII ( Additional Information ). A summary of the principal terms of the PSP is set out in paragraph 10.1 of this Part XII (Additional information ). (F) Share ownership requirements To align their interests with those of shareholders, Executive Directors are required to build and maintain significant holdings of shares in the Company over time. The requirements for theCEO and CFO are 450 per cent. and 350 per cent. of salary respectively. Until the relevantshare ownership requirements have been met, Executive Directors are required to hold allHaleon Shares acquired under the PSP and/or DABP (net of income tax and NationalInsurance contributions). Non-Executive Directors (including the Chair) are also encouraged tobuild up a personal holding in the shares of the Company equal to the value of one year of theirannual base fee. Executive Directors are required to comply with shareholding requirements for two years after departure, at a level equal to the lower of their shareholding requirement immediately prior todeparture or their actual shareholding on departure. (G) Recruitment policy The remuneration package of new Executive Directors will be determined on a case-by-case basis, in line with the provisions of the directors' remuneration policy in force at the time. The Remuneration Committee is mindful of the sensitivity relating to recruitment packages and, in particular, the 'buying out' of rights relating to previous employment. The intent is to seek tominimise such arrangements. However, in certain circumstances, the RemunerationCommittee may determine that such arrangements are in the best interests of the Companyand its shareholders, and such arrangements will, where possible, be on a like-for-like basiswith the forfeited remuneration terms. (H) Termination policy In the event of termination, the Executive Directors' service agreements provide for payments of base salary, pensions and benefits over the notice period or for GlaxoSmithKline ConsumerHealthcare Overseas Limited to terminate immediately on making a payment (or phased payments)in lieu of notice equivalent to base salary only for the notice period (or the remainder of suchperiod). Notice (or payment in lieu) will not be payable i n certain circumstances, including where an Executive Director is guilty of (i) wilfully neglecting his duties, or (ii) committing any serious orpersistent breach of his service agreement or gr oss misconduct. There is no contractual right to any bonus or long term incentive payment in the event of a notice of termination being given or receivedon or before the date on which the bonus or long term incentive payment would otherwise havebeen paid, although the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to pay such a bonusor long term incentive payment. 280 (I) Malus and clawback In certain circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may at any time prior to the second anniversary of the date the cash element of an annual bonus is paid or a PSP, DABP or SVPAward (an \" Executive Award \") vests: (i) reduce (to zero if appropriate) the cash bonus or Executive Award; (ii) impose additional conditions on the cash bonus or Executive Award;(iii) increase the length of the performance period applicable to an Executive Award (or delaythe payment of a cash bonus or the vesting of an Executive Award); or (iv) require that aparticipant either return some or all of the Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs acquired under anExecutive Award or make a cash payment to the Company in respect of the Haleon Shares orHaleon ADSs delivered under an Executive Award or cash bonus paid. The Remuneration Committee may only invoke these malus and clawback provisions in accordance with the Haleon malus and clawback policy from time to time, in circumstancessuch as a material misstatement of results; a failure of risk management resulting in materialfinancial loss; an error or material misstatement which results in an overpayment (such as inthe assessment of performance); a corporate failure of the Haleon Group; employeemisconduct; or material reputational damage to the Haleon Group. 10. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS Following Admission, the Company intends to operate three discretionary share-based incentive plans: the PSP, the DABP and a share value plan (the \" SVP \") (together, the \"Executive Plans \"). The Company also intends to operate two tax-advantaged all-employee share-based incentive plans: a share acquisition and free share plan, known as a UK ShareReward Plan (\" Share Reward Plan \") and a savings-related share option plan, known as a UK Sharesave plan (the \" Sharesave Plan \") (the Share Reward Plan and the Sharesave Plan, together with the Executive Plans, the \" Plans \"). The main features of each of the Plans are set out below, with the common terms of the Executive Plans set out in paragraph 10.6 of thisPart XII ( Additional Information ) and the common terms of the Plans as a whole set out in paragraph 10.7 of this Part XII ( Additional Information ). 10.1 PSP The PSP was adopted by the Board on 23 May 2022, conditional on Admission. The PSP is a discretionary share plan, under which the Remuneration Committee may grant awards overHaleon Shares or Haleon ADSs (\" PSP Awards \") to incentivise and retain eligible employees. The PSP will be administered by the Remuneration Committee or by any sub-committee orperson duly authorised by it. (A) Individual limit Awards will not be granted to an Executive Director under the PSP over Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs with a market value (as determined by the Remuneration Committee) in excessof the relevant limit set out in the prevailing directors' remuneration policy, in respect of anyfinancial year of the Company. It is the Remuneration Committee's current intention that PSP Awards to be granted to the Executive Directors in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2022 will be calculatedby reference to 450 per cent. of salary for the CEO and 350 per cent. of salary for the CFO(these amounts are exclusive of any 'refill awards'). In applying this limit, no account will be taken of Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs representing notional dividends on PSP or Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs which have beenawarded to ensure that a participant is not financially disadvantaged if they agree to satisfy theemployer's national insurance or social security liability in relation to their PSP Award. 281 (B) Performance conditions The vesting of PSP Awards will be subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions. The performance conditions will normally be measured over a period of at least three financialyears for PSP Awards granted to Executive Directors and any member of the Executive Team. Any performance condition may be amended in accordance with its terms or if there is a situation which causes the Remuneration Committee to consider that any amendedperformance condition would be a fairer measure of performance. (C) Vesting of PSP Awards Performance conditions will be assessed as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of the relevant performance period. The Remuneration Committee will determine the extent towhich the PSP Awards will then vest, taking into account the extent that the performanceconditions have been satisfied. To the extent that they vest, PSP Awards will normally vest onthe vesting date set by the Remuneration Committee at grant, which will normally be the thirdanniversary of the date of grant. (D) Holding period The Remuneration Committee may also determine at grant that a PSP Award is subject to an additional holding period following vesting. Where a holding period applies, PSP Awards willeither vest at the end of the holding period or they may vest before the start of the holdingperiod but some or all of the vested Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs will be subject torestrictions during the holding period. 10.2 DABP The DABP was adopted by the Board on 23 May 2022, conditional on Admission. The DABP is a discretionary share plan implemented so that a portion of a participant's annual bonus can bedeferred into an award of Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs (a \" DABP Award \"). The DABP will be administered by the Remuneration Committee or by any sub-committee or person dulyauthorised by it. DABP Awards will normally vest on such date or dates as the Remuneration Committee may determine when the DABP Award is granted. 10.3 SVP The SVP was adopted by the Board on 23 May 2022, conditional on Admission. The SVP is a discretionary share plan, under which the Remuneration Committee may grant awards overHaleon Shares or Haleon ADSs (\" SVP Awards \") to incentivise and retain eligible employees of the Haleon Group. Save for any 'refill awards' referred to in paragraph 8.4 of this Part XII(Additional Information ), SVP Awards cannot be granted to Executive Directors or to any Senior Manager who, by analogy with the corresponding GSK 'Share Value Plan', would nothave been eligible to participate in that GSK plan. As part of its programme to incentivise andretain its employees, the Company will explore a broadly-based one-time award, subject tovesting conditions, that may be settled in newly issued Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs (notexceeding 2,600,000 Haleon Shares (or the equivalent value of Haleon ADSs) in total). TheSVP will be administered by the Remuneration Committee or by any sub-committee or personduly authorised by it. (A) Individual limit Except in exceptional circumstances, SVP Awards will not normally be granted to an eligible employee under the SVP over Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs with a market value (asdetermined by the Remuneration Committee) in excess of 300 per cent. of salary, in respect ofany financial year of the Company. 282 In applying this limit, no account will be taken of Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs representing notional dividends on SVP or Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs which have beenawarded to ensure that a participant is not financially disadvantaged if they agree to satisfy theemployer's national insurance or social security liability in relation to their SVP Award. (B) Additional conditions The vesting of SVP Awards may be subject to the satisfaction of additional conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time of grant. Any such condition may be amended orwaived by the Remuneration Committee. It is not currently intended that vesting of SVPAwards will be subject to performance or other conditions. (C) Vesting of SVP Awards The Remuneration Committee will determine the extent to which the SVP Awards will vest, taking into account the extent that any additional conditions have been satisfied. To the extentthat they vest, SVP Awards will normally vest on the vesting date set by the RemunerationCommittee at grant. 10.4 Share Reward Plan The Share Reward Plan was adopted by the Board on 23 May 2022, conditional on Admission. The Share Reward Plan is an all-employee share ownership plan established by the Companywhich has been designed to meet HMRC requirements so that Shares can be acquired by UKemployees in a tax-efficient manner. (A) Grant of Share Reward Plan awards Under the Share Reward Plan, eligible employees may be: (i) offered the opportunity to buy Haleon Shares up to a maximum value of the lesser of \u00a31,800 and 10 per cent. of their pre-taxsalary each year (\" Partnership Shares \"); (ii) given up to two free Haleon Shares (\" Matching Shares \") for each Partnership Share bought; (iii) awarded free Haleon Shares up to a value of \u00a33,600 (\" Free Shares \") each year; and/or (iv) allowed or required to purchase Haleon Shares using dividends received on Shares held in the Share Reward Plan (\" Dividend Shares \"). The Board may change these limits in the future should the relevant legislation change themaximum levels of participation referred to above. (B) Share Reward Plan Trust The Share Reward Plan operates through a UK-resident trust (the \" Trust \"). The trustee of the Trust acquires the Haleon Shares that are awarded to or purchased on behalf of participants. Aparticipant will be the beneficial owner of any Haleon Shares held on their behalf by the trusteeof the Trust. (C) Eligibility Each time the Board decides to make an award under the Share Reward Plan, all employees (including Executive Directors) of the Company and its subsidiaries participating in the ShareReward Plan, where those employees are UK resident taxpayers, must be offered theopportunity to participate. Other employees of the Haleon Group may be permitted toparticipate at the Board's discretion. Employees who are invited to participate must havecompleted any specified minimum qualifying period of employment (as determined by theBoard in line with the relevant legislation, which currently may not exceed 18 months) beforethey can participate. 283 (D) Partnership Shares The Board may allow a participant to use pre-tax salary to buy Partnership Shares at their then market value or (where pre-tax salary is accumulated) by reference to the market value eitherat the start or end of the relevant accumulation period. Once acquired, Partnership Shares maybe withdrawn from the Trust by the participant at any time. Participants can stop contributing at any time. The participant's contributions may be used to buy Partnership Shares immediately or may be accumulated for up to 12 months before theyare used to buy Haleon Shares. (E) Matching Shares The Board may, in its discretion, offer free Matching Shares to a participant who has purchased Partnership Shares. There is a holding period of between three and five years (orsuch other period as may be permitted by the relevant legislation from time to time) duringwhich the participant cannot withdraw the Matching Shares from the Trust, unless theparticipant ceases to be employed by the Haleon Group. The precise duration of this holdingperiod will be determined by the Board each time Matching Shares are awarded. The Board, inits discretion, may provide that the Matching Shares will be forfeited if the participant ceases tobe employed by the Haleon Group other than because of death, retirement, injury, disability,redundancy, or the sale of the individual's employing company or business out of the HaleonGroup (each a \" Good Leaver Reason \") or if the related Partnership Shares are withdrawn from the Trust. (F) Free Shares There will be a holding period of between three and five years (or such other period as may be permitted by the relevant legislation from time to time) during which the participant cannotwithdraw the Free Shares from the Trust unless the participant ceases to be employed by amember of the Haleon Group. The precise duration of this holding period will be determined bythe Board each time Free Shares are awarded. The Board, in its discretion, may provide thatthe Free Shares will be forfeited if the participant ceases to be employed by the Haleon Groupother than for a Good Leaver Reason. Free Shares must generally be offered to all eligibleemployees on similar terms, and the award may be subject to performance measures. \"Similarterms\" means the terms may only be varied by reference to remuneration, length of service orhours worked. (G) Reinvestment of dividends The Board may allow or require a participant to reinvest (and acquire Haleon Shares with) the whole or part of any dividends paid on Haleon Shares held in the Trust on their behalf.Dividend Shares must be held in the Trust for no less than three years, unless the participantceases to be employed by the Haleon Group. (H) Voting Rights Participants may be offered the opportunity to direct the trustee of the Trust how to exercise the voting rights attached to the Haleon Shares held on their behalf. The trustee will notexercise the voting rights unless they receive the participants' instructions. (I) Corporate events In the event of a general offer being made to the Company's shareholders (or a similar takeover event taking place), participants will be able to direct the trustee of the Trust as tohow to act in relation to their Haleon Shares held in the Share Reward Plan. In the event of aninternal reorganisation of the Haleon Group, any Haleon Shares held by participants may bereplaced by equivalent shares in a new holding company. 284 (J) Adjustments Haleon Shares acquired on a variation of the share capital of the Company will usually be treated in the same way as the Haleon Shares originally acquired or awarded under the ShareReward Plan in respect of which the rights were conferred and as if they were acquired orawarded at the same time. (K) Rights attaching to Haleon Shares Any Haleon Shares issued to the trustee of the Trust will rank equally with other Haleon Shares then in issue (except for rights arising by reference to a record time or date prior to the time ordate of issue). In the event of a rights issue, participants will be able to direct the trustee of theTrust as to how to act in respect of the Haleon Shares held in the Share Reward Plan on theirbehalf. 10.5 Sharesave Plan The Sharesave Plan was adopted by the Board on 23 May 2022, conditional on Admission. The Sharesave Plan is an all-employee share option plan established by the Company whichhas been designed to meet HMRC requirements so that UK employees can acquire fully paidHaleon Shares in a tax-efficient manner. (A) Eligibility Each time the Board decides to issue an invitation to employees to participate in the Sharesave Plan, all employees (including Executive Directors) of the Company and itssubsidiaries participating in the Sharesave Plan, where those employees are UK residenttaxpayers, must be offered the opportunity to participate. Other employees of the HaleonGroup may be permitted to participate at the Board's discretion. Employees who are invited toparticipate must have completed any specified minimum qualifying period of employment (asdetermined by the Board in line with the relevant legislation, which currently may not exceedfive years) before they can participate. (B) Savings contract Under the Sharesave Plan, eligible employees must enter into a linked savings contract to make savings over a period of three or five years. The Board has the discretion to set thelength of the savings contract at three and/or five years. Monthly savings by a participant underall savings contracts linked to options granted under any tax-advantaged savings-related shareoption plan may not exceed the statutory maximum, which is currently set at \u00a3500 per month.The Board may set a lower limit in relation to any particular grant. At the end of the savingscontract, participants may either withdraw their savings on a tax-free basis or use their savings(plus any interest or bonus) to acquire Haleon Shares. (C) Option price The proceeds of the savings contract can be used to exercise an option to acquire Haleon Shares at an option price per Haleon Share. The Board sets the option price which must not bemanifestly less than 80 per cent. of the market value of a Haleon Share on the business daybefore the date of the invitation, or on the date specified in the invitation, or the average marketvalue over the three preceding business days. (D) Exercise of options Options can normally only be exercised within six months of the date that the bonus becomes payable (or would have become payable if a bonus was due) under the terms of the savingscontract. Options not exercised by the end of this period will lapse. 285 (E) Leaving employment Generally, an option will lapse on the date the eligible employee ceases to hold office or employment. However, where a participant ceases to hold office or employment because of injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or the sale of the individual's employing company or business out ofthe Haleon Group, their option may be exercised within six months after the participant'scessation of office or employment. If a participant ceases to hold office or employment morethan three years after the option was granted, their option may be exercised within six monthsafter their cessation of office or employment provided the reason for the cessation is notmisconduct. If a participant dies, their option may be exercised within one year by theirpersonal representatives. (F) Corporate events On a takeover, scheme of arrangement, compulsory acquisition or certain other corporate reorganisations, options can generally be exercised early to the extent of the savings made upto the date of exercise. Alternatively, participants may be permitted to exchange their optionsfor options over shares in the acquiring company. (G) Adjustments In the event of a variation in the Company's share capital, the Board may adjust the number of Haleon Shares subject to options and/or the option price applicable to options in such manneras it considers appropriate and as is permitted by the Sharesave legislation. (H) Rights attached to Haleon Shares Options granted under the Sharesave Plan will not confer shareholder rights on a participant until that participant has exercised their option and received the underlying Haleon Shares. AnyHaleon Shares issued will rank equally with other Haleon Shares then in issue (except forrights arising by reference to a record date prior to their issue). 10.6 Terms common to the Executive Plans (A) Eligibility All employees (including the Executive Directors) of the Haleon Group are eligible for selection to participate in the Executive Plans at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, save forthe SVP under which no awards may be granted to Executive Directors or (save for any 'refillawards' referred to in paragraph 8.4 of this Part XII ( Additional Information )) to any Senior Manager who, by analogy with the corresponding GSK 'Share Value Plan', would not havebeen eligible to participate in that GSK plan. (B) Timing of awards Executive Awards will normally be granted (i) during the 42 days beginning on: (a) Admission; (b) the first day after the announcement of the Company's results for any period; (c) in the caseof the PSP and DABP only, the day on which the directors' remuneration policy (or amendmentto it) is approved by the Company's shareholders; (d) the day on which changes to thelegislation or regulations affecting share plans are announced, effected or made; or (e) to theextent that share dealing restrictions apply in any of the preceding four periods, the first dealingday on which such dealing restrictions are lifted, or (ii) on any other day on which theRemuneration Committee determines that exceptional circumstances exist which justify themaking of an Executive Award at that time. 286 (C) Form of awards The Remuneration Committee may grant Executive Awards as conditional awards of Haleon Shares, or nil-cost options over Haleon Shares. No payment is required for the grant of anExecutive Award. Executive Awards structured as nil-cost options will normally be exercisablefrom the point of vesting (or, where a PSP Award is subject to a holding period, the end of thatholding period) until the tenth anniversary of the grant date, except for SVP Awards which willnormally be exercisable for six months from vesting. (D) Settlement The Remuneration Committee may, in its discretion, decide to satisfy an Executive Award with a cash payment equal to the market value of the Haleon Shares that the participant would havereceived had the relevant Executive Award been satisfied with Haleon Shares. (E) Dividend equivalents If the Remuneration Committee so determines, participants will receive an amount (in additional Haleon Shares, unless the Remuneration Committee decides it will be paid (in full orin part) in cash) equal to the value of any dividends declared during the period beginning onthe grant date and ending on the date on which the Executive Award vests or, if there is aholding period applicable to a PSP Award, when that holding period ends, and which wouldhave been paid on the Haleon Shares subject to an Executive Award which vest. This amountmay assume the reinvestment of dividends and exclude or include special dividends. (F) Malus and clawback The malus and clawback policy summarised in paragraph 9.4(I) above will apply to Executive Awards. (G) Cessation of employment PSP AwardsAn unvested PSP Award will usually lapse when a participant ceases to be an employee or director of the Haleon Group. If, however, a participant ceases to be an employee or director of the Haleon Group because of their death, ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement with the agreement of theiremploying company, the sale of the participant's employing company or business out of theHaleon Group or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (i.e.they leave as a \"good leaver\"), their PSP Award will normally continue to vest (and bereleased) on the date when it would have vested (and been released) if they had not ceased tobe an employee or director of the Haleon Group. The extent to which PSP Awards vest in these circumstances will be determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the satisfaction of any performance conditionsapplicable to PSP Awards measured over the original performance period. The RemunerationCommittee retains discretion, however, to allow the PSP Award to vest (and be released) onthe individual's cessation of office or employment or such other date as it decides, taking intoaccount any applicable performance conditions measured up to such point as it decides. Unless the Remuneration Committee decides otherwise, the extent to which a PSP Award vests will also take into account the proportion of the performance period (or, in the case of aPSP Award not subject to performance conditions, the vesting period) which has elapsed onthe cessation of the participant's office or employment with the Haleon Group. If a participant ceases to be an employee or director of the Haleon Group during a holding period in respect of a PSP Award for any reason other than gross misconduct or summarydismissal, their PSP Award will normally be released at the end of the holding period. If aparticipant leaves for gross misconduct or is summarily dismissed, any outstanding PSPAwards they hold will immediately lapse. 287 DABP Awards A DABP Award will vest in full as if the participant had not ceased to be an employee or director of the Haleon Group unless the Remuneration Committee determines that the DABPAward will vest in its entirety on a different date. If a participant leaves for gross misconduct oris summarily dismissed, any DABP Awards they hold will immediately lapse. SVP AwardsAn unvested SVP Award will usually lapse when a participant ceases to be an employee or director of the Haleon Group. If, however, a participant ceases to be an employee or director of the Haleon Group because of their ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement with the agreement of their employingcompany, the sale of the participant's employing company or business out of the Haleon Groupor in other circumstances at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (i.e. they leave as a\"good leaver\"), their SVP Award will vest on the individual's cessation of office or employmentor such other date as the Remuneration Committee may decide (not being more than 30 daysafter cessation of the participant's office or employment with the Haleon Group). If a participant dies, their SVP Award will vest on the date of their death on the basis set out for other \"good leavers\" below. Unless the Remuneration Committee decides otherwise, the extent to which an SVP Award vests will take into account the proportion of the vesting period which has elapsed on thecessation of the participant's office or employment with the Haleon Group (rounded up to thenearest whole year), and vesting will occur regardless of the satisfaction of any conditionsapplicable to that SVP Award. Executive Awards structured as nil-cost optionsExecutive Awards structured as nil-cost options which do not lapse may normally be exercised to the extent vested for a period of 12 months (six months in the case of the SVP) after vesting(or, where PSP Awards are subject to a holding period, release). Where nil-cost options have already vested (and, where relevant, been released) on the date of cessation of office or employment, those options may normally be exercised for a period of12 months from the date of cessation (or six months for a nil-cost option granted under theSVP), unless the participant leaves for gross misconduct or is summarily dismissed, in whichcase their options will lapse. (H) Corporate events If there is a takeover of the Company, Executive Awards may vest (and be released) early. The proportion of any unvested PSP Awards which vest will be determined by the RemunerationCommittee, taking into account performance up to that time and, unless the RemunerationCommittee determines otherwise, the proportion of the performance period which has elapsed.DABP Awards will vest in full. SVP Awards will vest in full, unless the Remuneration Committeedetermines otherwise. Awards structured as nil-cost options may then normally be exercised for a period of six weeks, and will be automatically exercised at the end of that period. Alternatively, the RemunerationCommittee may require that Executive Awards are exchanged for equivalent awards overshares in another company (subject to the acquiring company's consent). In the case of PSPAwards, the replacement awards will be subject to appropriate performance conditions. In the event of a demerger, special dividend or other transaction which in the Remuneration Committee's opinion may affect the value of Haleon Shares, the Remuneration Committee mayallow the Executive Award to vest (in full or in part) or provide for the Executive Award to beautomatically exchanged for an equivalent award over shares in another company. 288 (I) Variation of capital If there is a variation of the share capital of the Company or in the event of a demerger, special dividend or other transaction which in the Remuneration Committee's opinion may affect thevalue of Haleon Shares, the Remuneration Committee may make such adjustments to thenumber or class of shares subject to Executive Awards and/or change the identity of thecompany whose shares are subject to the Executive Award, in each case as it considersappropriate. (J) Rights attaching to Haleon Shares Haleon Shares issued and/or transferred under the Executive Plans will not confer rights on any participant until that participant has received the underlying Haleon Shares. Any HaleonShares issued will rank equally with Haleon Shares then in issue (except for rights arising byreference to a record date prior to their issue). 10.7 Terms common to the Plans (A) Overall limits The Plans may operate over new issue Haleon Shares, treasury Haleon Shares or Haleon Shares purchased in the market. The rules of the Plans provide that, in any ten year rollingperiod, the number of Haleon Shares which may be issued under the Plans and any otheremployee share plan adopted by the Company may not exceed 10 per cent. of the issuedordinary share capital of the Company from time to time. In addition, the number of HaleonShares which may be issued under the Executive Plans and any other discretionary employeeshare plan adopted by the Company may not exceed 5 per cent. of the issued ordinary sharecapital of the Company from time to time in the same period. Haleon Shares used to settle 'refill awards' granted under the Executive Plans will count towards these limits. Haleon Shares transferred out of treasury will count towards these limits for so long as this is required under institutional shareholder guidelines. However, awards which are relinquished orlapse will be disregarded for the purposes of these limits. (B) Amendments The Board (or, in the case of the Executive Plans, the Remuneration Committee) may, at any time, amend the provisions of the Plans in any respect. The prior approval of the Company'sshareholders must be obtained in the case of any amendment which is made to the advantageof eligible employees and/or participants and relates to the provisions relating to eligibility,individual or overall limits, the basis for determining the entitlement to, and the terms of,awards, the adjustments that may be made in the event of any variation to the share capital ofthe Company and/or the rule relating to such prior approval. There are, however, exceptions tothis requirement to obtain shareholder approval for any minor amendments to benefit theadministration of the Plans, to take account of the provisions of any legislation, or to obtain ormaintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for any participant ormember of the Haleon Group. (C) Non-transferability Awards (other than where indicated otherwise in connection with the Share Reward Plan under paragraph 10.4 of this Part XII ( Additional Information )) are not transferable other than to the participant's personal representatives in the event of the participant's death. 289 (D) Benefits not pensionable Benefits received under the Plans are not pensionable. (E) Overseas plans The Board may, at any time, establish further plans based on the Plans for overseas territories. Any such plan will be similar to the Plans but may be modified to take account of local tax,exchange control or securities laws. Any Haleon Shares made available under such furtheroverseas plans must be treated as counting against the limits on individual and overallparticipation under the Plans. The PSP and SVP incorporate separate schedules for employees who are resident in the United States of America, France and Switzerland in compliance with the relevant securitiesand tax laws. (F) Termination No awards may be granted under the Plans more than ten years after Admission. 10.8 The Company's employee benefit trust The Company intends to establish following Admission an employee benefit trust or trusts (the \"Trusts \") to operate in connection with the Plans. The Company will have the power to appoint and remove the trustee(s) of the Trusts. The Trusts will benefit current and former employeesand directors (other than Non-Executive Directors) of the Haleon Group and certain membersof their families (excluding any person resident in the jurisdiction where a Trust is constitutedfor tax purposes, as appropriate). The trustee(s) of the Trusts will have the power to acquire Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs and, with effect from Admission, any Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs acquired may be used for thepurposes of the Plans, other employee share plans established by the Haleon Group from timeto time or otherwise for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the Trusts. With effect from Admission, the Haleon Group may fund the Trusts by loan or gift to acquire Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs either by market purchase or by subscription. Any awards tosubscribe for Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs granted to the Trusts or Haleon Shares orHaleon ADSs issued to the Trusts will be treated as counting against the overall limits thatapply to the Plans. Following Admission, the trustee(s) of the Trusts will not, without HaleonShareholder approval, hold or acquire more than 5 per cent. of the Company's issued ordinaryshare capital from time to time (disregarding any Haleon Shares or Haleon ADSs held by it asa nominee). 11. PENSIONS Defined benefit pension schemesOne of the former sponsoring employers in GSK's UK Pension Schemes and the other material funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the SmithKline Beecham Senior ExecutivePension Plan (the \" SBSEPP \"), is a company within the Haleon Group (the \" Haleon Employer \"). With effect from the end of 31 March 2022, the Haleon Employer ceased to participate in each of the UK Pension Schemes and the SBSEPP. All of the Haleon Employer'sliabilities in respect of the UK Pension Schemes and the SBSEPP were apportioned toGlaxoSmithKline Services Unlimited (another of the sponsoring employers and a company inthe GSK Group following the Demerger) by way of a statutory apportionment mechanism. The US defined benefit plan has been closed to future accrual since 1 January 2021. The US defined benefit plan liabilities and assets related to Group employees are being retained by theGSK Group following the Demerger. The majority of the US post-retirement healthcare planliabilities will be retained by the GSK Group following the Demerger, with the exception of theliability for active Haleon Group employees which will transfer to the Group. 290 The majority of the legacy defined benefit pension liabilities transferring to the Group relate to arrangements outside of the UK and USA. Over 90 per cent. of these liabilities relate to thepension arrangements in Ireland, Switzerland and Germany. The Group will assume liabilitiesfor current and (where applicable) former employees under such arrangements and, wheresuch plans are funded, a share of the plan assets will be transferred to the plan set up by theGroup. Ongoing pension provision for Haleon Group employeesIn the UK, since 1 April 2022, Group employees have been provided with ongoing accrual via LifeSight, a defined contribution master trust arrangement provided by Willis Towers Watson.Certain risk benefits, such as life assurance, are provided to Group employees through aseparate arrangement with Legal & General. The Demerger does not change thesearrangements with LifeSight and Legal & General. In the USA, ongoing accrual is provided via a GSK Group defined contribution arrangement. The Group's US employees are currently members of this plan, but a defined contribution planis being established for them and they will join this plan at or before the date of Demerger. TheUS defined contribution plan assets related to Group employees will be transferred to this plan. Outside of the UK and the USA, the Group has committed to replicating GSK Group benefits where possible. Some pension arrangements operate on a stand-alone basis for the Group,and these will continue beyond the Demerger, but other arrangements cover both GSK Groupand Group employees. In the latter case, arrangements have been made to separate theseplans. In most cases, the GSK Group will retain the existing plan and the Group will establish anew plan, with a transfer of the part of the assets of the GSK plan attributable to Groupemployees being made to the plan established by the Group. 12. EMPLOYEES The average monthly number of personnel 88(including directors) employed by the Group for the three years ended 31 December 2019, 2020 and 2021 was 19,000, 21,900 and 22,800respectively. The monthly average number of Group personnel by region is included below: Region 2021 2020 2019 North 19,000 The number of personnel from 2019 to 2021 increased mainly as a result of the integration of employees from the Pfizer Group upon the completion of the Pfizer Transaction. Thecompletion date of the Pfizer Transaction was 31 July 2019 however, the transfer of theemployees took place in phases. As markets have been integrated, this has subsequentlyresulted in employees being transferred to the Group during the latter part of 2019 through to2021. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in personnel due to existing restructuringprogrammes and synergies achieved from the Pfizer Transaction. Total personnel in March 2022 was broadly in line with the 2021 average with North American reductions (driven by restructuring programmes and synergies) during the course of 2021largely offset by the recruitment of additional personnel in 2022 in both EMEA and LatAm andAPAC to support Group administrative operations previously carried out by GSK. Total APACpersonnel also increased due to the transfer of the Pulogadung site from GSK into the Group'smanufacturing network in late 2021. 88Full-time equivalent employees and agency staff (rounded to the nearest 100). The average number of agency staff in 2021 was 2,400. 291 13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Details of related party transactions entered into by members of the Group during the period covered by the Historical Financial Information are as set out in Note 30 of the HistoricalFinancial Information. The nature of the related party transactions of the Group has notchanged between the period covered by the Historical Financial Information and the LatestPracticable Date from those described in Note 30 to the Historical Financial Information. Saveas set out above and as described in paragraph 15 of this Part XII ( Additional Information ), there have been no other related party transactions entered into by members of the Groupwhich require disclosure under IFRS between the period covered by the Historical FinancialInformation and the Latest Practicable Date. 14. LITIGATION Save as described below, there are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened of which the Company isaware) during the period covering the 12 months preceding the date of this document whichmay have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on the Company's and/or theGroup's financial position or profitability. The Group is currently, and may from time to time be, involved in significant legal and administrative proceedings, principally product liability, intellectual property, tax, antitrust,securities law, employment and governmental investigations, as well as related privatelitigation, further details of which are set out below. The Group makes provision for theseproceedings on a regular basis, as noted below. The Group may become involved in significantlegal proceedings in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of theexpected financial effect, if any, that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. With respect to each of the legal proceedings described below, other than those for which a provision has been made, the Group is unable to make a reliable estimate of the expectedfinancial effect at this stage. In particular, the Group does not believe that information about theamount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would be meaningful with respect to those legalproceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the stage ofproceedings, the entitlement of parties to appeal a decision and clarity as to theories of liability,damages and governing law. At 31 December 2021, the Group had \u00a314 million of provisions for legal disputes and other matters, including amounts relating to legal and administrative proceedings, which are includedwithin \"Other Provisions\" as set out in Note 26 to the Historical Financial Information of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings (No.2) Limited Schedule II . The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlementnegotiations. The Group's position could change over time, and, therefore, there can be noassurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will notexceed by a material amount the amount of the provisions reported in the Group's financialaccounts. If this were to happen, it could have a material adverse impact on the results ofoperation of the Group in the reporting period in which the judgments are incurred or thesettlements entered into. 14.1 Zantac litigation In 2019, the GSK Group was contacted by several regulatory authorities regarding the detection of N-Nitroso-dimethylamine (\" NDMA \") in Zantac (ranitidine) products. Based on information available at the time and correspondence with regulators, the GSK Group madethe decision to suspend the release, distribution and supply of all dose forms of Zantac to allmarkets pending the outcome of the ongoing tests and investigations. Also, as a precautionaryaction, the GSK Group made the decision to initiate a voluntary pharmacy/retail level recall ofZantac products globally. 292 On 30 April 2020, the EMA recommended the suspension of ranitidine medicines. Following the publication of the EMA's recommendation, the GSK Group communicated a decision not tore-enter the market. In the USA, the FDA requested that all manufacturers withdraw ranitidineproducts from the market. GSK, GlaxoSmithKline LLC, GlaxoSmithKline (America) Inc. and/or Pfizer have been named as defendants (alongside other manufacturers of ranitidine, as well as retailers and distributors)in over 2,200 US personal injury lawsuits involving Zantac. There are also numerous unfiledclaims added to a registry implemented by the court presiding over the Zantac MDLproceeding. Class actions alleging economic injury and medical monitoring also have beenfiled in federal court. Outside the USA, there are seven class actions (two active) and fortyindividual actions pending in Canada, along with a class action in Israel. On 6 February 2020, the US product liability litigation was assigned MDL status in the Southern District of Florida. On 24 August 2020, the GSK Group and the Pfizer Group filedmotions to dismiss the MDL claims based on innovator liability, preemption and deficiencies inthe pleadings. On 31 December 2020 and 8 January 2021, the court granted the GSK Group'sand the Pfizer Group's motion on innovator liability, the generic defendants' motion onpreemption and the motion of all defendants on deficiencies in the pleadings with leave toreplead. The plaintiffs have filed notices of appeal related to the decisions on innovator liabilityand generic preemption. Plaintiffs filed amended master complaints, which the defendantsmoved to dismiss on 24 March 2021. On 30 June 2021, the court issued its rulings on theadditional motions. The court granted the GSK Group's and the Pfizer Group's motions todismiss on innovator liability and \"failure to warn through the FDA\" claims. The court alsodismissed the claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act withprejudice. On 20 March 2020, the Department of Justice (the \" DOJ \") sent the GSK Group notice of a civil investigation it had opened into allegations of False Claims Act violations by the GSK Grouprelated to Zantac. On 18 June 2020, the DOJ served a civil investigative demand on the GSKGroup, formalising its request for documents. On the same day, the New Mexico AttorneyGeneral filed a lawsuit against multiple defendants, including the GSK Group and the PfizerGroup, alleging violations of state consumer protection and false advertising statutes, amongother claims. The City of Baltimore filed a similar action on 12 November 2020. In addition to the product liability cases filed in the MDL, cases have been filed against the GSK Group and the Pfizer Group in several State Courts, including a consolidated action inCalifornia State Court. The first trial in relation to Zantac is set to commence on 22 August2022 in the Circuit Court of the Third Judicial District, Madison County Illinois, followed by thefirst trial in the Superior Court of California, Alameda, scheduled to commence in February2023, with three further bellwether trials to be scheduled in 2023. With respect to the USA, the OTC rights to Zantac were originally owned by a joint venture established between the GSK Group and Warner Lambert in 1993. Following the grant of FDAapproval for the OTC formulation in 1995, OTC Zantac was marketed by the GSK-WarnerLambert joint venture until 1998 when the joint venture was terminated and, following which,Warner Lambert retained the exclusive rights to the OTC product. In 2000, Warner Lambertwas acquired by Pfizer. In 2006, Johnson & Johnson acquired Pfizer's OTC business, includingthe rights to OTC Zantac, which were on-sold to Boehringer Ingelheim as a condition to mergercontrol approval. In 2017, Boehringer Ingelheim sold its consumer healthcare business(including OTC Zantac) to Sanofi. Under the Pfizer SAPA, CH JVCo is required to indemnify the GSK Group and the Pfizer Group in respect of \"Purchaser Liabilities\" and \"Assumed Liabilities\", further detail on which isset out in paragraph 15.2 of this Part XII ( Additional Information ) below. Whilst Pfizer and GSK have each served CH JVCo with notice of potential claims under the relevant indemnification provisions in the Pfizer SAPA in relation to possible liabilitiesconnected with OTC Zantac, it is not possible, at this stage, to meaningfully assess whether 293 the outcome will result in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliably estimate what liability (if any) that CH JVCo may have to the GSK Group and/or the Pfizer Group under the relevantindemnities. This is due to a number of factors and uncertainties, including: (A) the complex factual matrix relating to the third-party tort claims and the implications of the history of ownership of the US OTC Zantac rights, including: (i) the inability toestablish whether the patients took the OTC and/or the prescription Zantac productand over what period(s); (ii) the application of (and interaction between) the variousliability allocation and indemnification regimes entered into in connection with thesuccessive transfers of ownership of US OTC Zantac, as well as under the PfizerSAPA; and (iii) how that complex factual matrix and/or ownership history interacts withthe terms of the Pfizer SAPA to determine the application and scope of CH JVCo'sindemnification obligations to the GSK Group and/or the Pfizer Group; and (B) the current status of the respective proceedings, which remain at an early stage. 14.2 PPI litigation Certain members of the Group are defendants in the ongoing proton pump inhibitor (\" PPI\") litigation, in which plaintiffs allege that their use of PPIs caused serious bodily injuries, includingacute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal failure. As of January 2022,there are approximately 1,500 Prevacid24HR (OTC) personal injury lawsuits andapproximately 2,300 Nexium 24HR (OTC) lawsuits filed and pending against the Group, nearlyall of which are pending in an MDL in the District of New Jersey. In addition to the MDL cases,there is a small subset of cases pending in several state courts. Manufacturers of other PPIs, including both prescription and OTC products, are named as co-defendants in the MDL. The Group has filed motions to dismiss several hundred cases, butthe MDL court has not yet ruled on those motions. The first bellwether trial in the MDL is set for October 2022 and will focus on prescription products manufactured by other co-defendants. The Group and its Prevacid24HR (OTC) orNexium 24HR (OTC) products will not be involved in the first trial. Additional trials involvingother defendants, including the Group, may be scheduled for 2023 or 2024. The Group divested the rights to Prevacid in the USA in 2019, but retained certain historical litigation liabilities. Prevacid was originally acquired by the Group as part of the GSK/NovartisJV, and therefore, to the extent that the litigation, in whole or in part, gives rise to any liabilitiesthat result from, or otherwise relate to, acts or omissions of the Novartis group, or anycircumstances or events in existence or arising, in the period prior to completion of the GSK/Novartis JV, the Group may be entitled to indemnification by Novartis (subject to the applicablelimitations and financial thresholds set out in the Novartis Contribution Agreement) (seeparagraph 15.1 of this Part XII ( Additional Information ) below). 14.3 German competition litigation In 2013, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare GmbH & Co. KG and other members of a working group, K\u00f6rperpflege, Wasch- und Reinigungsmittel (\" KWR \"), of a German trade mark association, Markenverband e.V., were fined by the Federal Cartel Office of Germany, as aresult of the exchange of certain information during meetings from 2004 to 2006. Theinformation exchanged related primarily to annual terms negotiations with retailers and to thetiming and the order of magnitude of list price increases. A total fine of approximately\u20ac63 million was imposed in 2013 on 15 companies, including \u20ac5.1 million against the Group. Following the fine imposed by the Federal Cartel Office in 2013, the Group is party to eight active civil proceedings in Germany for damages against the Group and other manufacturers ofbranded drugstore products. The claimants allege that the exchange of information within KWRled to higher purchase prices being paid by the retailers, and therefore the Group and otherKWR members are jointly and severally liable for potential damages. The proceedings aretaking place in different courts across Germany and are at different stages. 294 Separate proceedings have been brought against the Group and certain other members of KWR by the insolvency administrator of Schlecker (formerly a large drugstore retailer inGermany) and other retailers, including M\u00fcller, Rossmann, Kaufland and Budnikowsky. Two ofthese actions have been dismissed in lower courts but are subject to appeal. For one of theseactions, the Federal Court of Justice has set a date for the oral hearing on the appeal for 5 July2022. Two related proceedings brought by Norma have concluded as the claimants withdrewtheir action. Additionally, the Group has intervened as a third party on the defendants' side in three separate proceedings brought by Bartels-Langness and Kaufland (in two separateproceedings). 15.

GSKCHH was the entity through which both GSK and Novartis held their equity interests in the GSK/Novartis JV. On 27 March 2018, GSK, Novartis, GSKCHH and respective GSK and Novartis shareholders in the GSK/Novartis JV entered into a put option implementation agreement,pursuant to which the parties agreed that Novartis would be bought out of the GSK/Novartis JVfor consideration of $13 billion (the \" Novartis Buyout \"). The Novartis Buyout completed on 1 June 2018. Under the Novartis Contribution Agreement, Novartis provided indemnities to GSKCHH in respect of: (i) pre-completion liabilities and liabilities resulting from pre-completion actions inrespect of the OTC business contributed by Novartis to the GSK/Novartis JV; and (ii) anypre-completion tax liabilities of the Novartis companies contributed by Novartis to the GSK/Novartis JV, in each case, subject to certain limited exceptions. These indemnities survived theNovartis Buyout and the creation of the subsequent GSK/Pfizer JV (see paragraph 15.2 of thisPart XII ( Additional Information ) below). Following completion of the Novartis Buyout, GSKCHH released and discharged GSK from any and all existing and future obligations under (and waived any and all rights to make any claimunder) the reciprocal indemnities that were provided by GSK to GSKCHH pursuant to theNovartis Contribution Agreement in respect of the business and companies contributed byGSK to the GSK/Novartis JV. 15.2 Pfizer Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement Pursuant to a stock and asset purchase agreement dated 19 December 2018 and amended and restated on 31 July 2019 (the \" Pfizer SAPA \"), GSK, Pfizer and CH JVCo agreed to form a new global consumer healthcare joint venture (the \" GSK/Pfizer JV \"), through: (i) the acquisition by CH JVCo of the Pfizer Contributed CH Business (as defined below) from Pfizerand (ii) the transfer by GSK to CH JVCo of those parts of the GSK Contributed CH Business 295 (as defined below) not already owned by GSKCHH (the former holding company of the Group) following the creation of the GSK/Novartis JV.

Subject to the Pfizer SHA, GSK has the right in its absolute discretion by notice to the Company at any time prior to completion of the Demerger to terminate the DemergerAgreement in connection with an abandonment of the Demerger. The Demerger Agreement contains certain customary indemnities under which GSK indemnifies the Company in respect of liabilities, losses demands, claims, costs, taxes anddamages arising, directly or indirectly, from or in consequence of certain claims. The Demerger Agreement also sets out how guarantees given by the GSK Group for the benefit of companies in the Group (or vice versa) will be dealt with following the Demerger. 302 15.7 Tax Covenant In accordance with the SCIA, the Company, CH JVCo, GSK, GSKCHH and Pfizer entered into a tax covenant on or around the date of this Prospectus, which is to be effective from the timeof the Demerger (the \" Tax Covenant \"). Subject to certain financial and other customary limitations, the Tax Covenant contains certain indemnities in respect of taxation given from GSK and Pfizer to the Company (and vice versa)where it has been agreed that such taxes are properly allocable to the indemnifying party.Amongst other things, GSK and Pfizer provide the Company with indemnities for tax arising (ifany) pursuant to certain pre-Demerger reorganisation steps within the Group and the stepswhich comprise the Separation. As is customary for demerger transactions, the Companyprovides a more limited set of tax indemnities to GSK and Pfizer. The indemnities in the Tax Covenant cover only liabilities which have been notified by the indemnified party to the indemnifying party by the end of the period ending 30 days after theexpiry of the period specified by statute during which an assessment of the relevant underlyingtax liability may be issued by the relevant tax authority or, if there is no such period, by the endof the period ending six years and 30 days after the end of the accounting period in which theDemerger occurs. The Tax Covenant also imposes certain restrictions on the Company, including certain restrictions with respect to actions following completion of the Demerger that could causeSeparation to fail to qualify for its intended US federal income tax treatment. The restrictionsprimarily require the Company to maintain the corporate structure of certain parts of the Groupas it was immediately prior to the Demerger. For example, there are restrictions on liquidatingcertain subsidiaries of the Company, or issuing or redeeming shares in those subsidiaries. Inaddition, there are restrictions on some intra-group disposals as well as non-ordinary course ofbusiness transactions. As a result of these restrictions (some of which could be in place for atleast two years), the Company's ability to engage in certain transactions, such as thedisposition of certain assets and certain repurchases of its stock, may be limited (although theGroup will nonetheless be entitled to take actions which would otherwise be restricted if theCompany first (i) obtains the consent of (or, in certain instances, if it consults with) GSK orPfizer (as applicable) or, in some cases, (ii) obtains an opinion from an appropriately qualifiedadviser or a ruling from the IRS regarding the tax consequences of the proposed actionswhich, in either case, is reasonably satisfactory to GSK or Pfizer (as applicable)). Although theCompany does not currently anticipate that these restrictions would have a material adverseimpact on the Company, these restrictions may reduce the Company's ability to engage incertain business transactions that otherwise might be advantageous. The Tax Covenant also contains provisions on administrative matters and the conduct of tax authority audits or disputes (including, in each case, how the parties should bear the costs andexpenses of the same). It also contains certain mechanical provisions to ensure that the taxindemnities in the Pfizer SAPA operate properly post-Demerger (i.e. once the Company is thehead of a standalone group). 15.8 Separation Co-operation and Implementation Agreement The Separation Co-operation and Implementation Agreement (the \" SCIA \") was entered into on or around the date of this Prospectus among GSK, Pfizer, Anacor, GSKCHH, PFCHH, CHJVCo and the Company, and details certain actions to be taken and arrangements to beimplemented to effect completion of, or which otherwise relate to, the Separation. The SCIArecords the obligations of the parties relating to such matters and contains certain terms onwhich relations between the parties will be governed following completion of the Separation.

The parties to the SCIA have agreed and acknowledged that they shall each take all actions that they are able to take (and shall procure so far as they are able to do so, that the membersof each of their respective groups do the same), so that certain dividends to be declared andpaid in connection with the Separation are so declared and paid prior to the commencement ofthe Demerger Completion Steps and, in respect of certain dividends, following receipt ofcertain regulatory approvals. In the event that any such dividends are in any respect defectiveor are susceptible to legal challenge, the Company has agreed and has undertaken to take allpossible lawful steps, (including, without limitation, distributable reserves planning andmanagement; rectification and ratification steps; and procuring that none of CH JVCo,GSKCHH or PFCHH or any other member of the Group take steps to seek recovery of priordividend payments), such that any amounts received by any member of the GSK Group or anymember of the Pfizer Group or to which they are entitled by way of dividend can be retained bythe relevant member(s) of the GSK Group or the Pfizer Group (as applicable). The Companyhas further agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to indemnify GSK, each member of the GSKGroup, Pfizer and each member of the Pfizer Group from and against any and all liabilities andcertain costs arising before, on, or after completion of the Separation in respect of: (i) anydefect in, or any actual or potential claim, proceeding, suit or action brought by any member ofthe Group that arises out of or in connection with any of the relevant dividends; and (ii) anyfailure by the Company to take all possible steps required by the SCIA to ensure that anyamounts received by any member of the GSK Group or any member of the Pfizer Group byway of any relevant dividend can be retained by the relevant member(s) of the GSK Groupand/or the Pfizer Group (as applicable).

The parties to the SCIA have agreed that the Pfizer SHA shall terminate with effect from Admission (without prejudice to any rights or liabilities arising under the Pfizer SHA prior tosuch termination) and that, notwithstanding any provision of the Pfizer SHA, the provisions ofthe Pfizer SHA that are expressly stated to continue after termination of the Pfizer SHA shallnot continue and, instead, certain of such provisions shall be set out or otherwise implementedin the SCIA or other documents to be entered into in connection with the Separation. 15.9 Exchange Agreements Subject to and shortly after completion of the Demerger, a series of share-for-share exchanges (together, the \" Share Exchanges \") will occur pursuant to the share exchange agreements summarised below in order to rationalise the Company's shareholding structure such that GSK,the SLPs and Pfizer will hold their remaining interests in the Consumer Healthcare Business byholding shares in the Company, as the listed parent company.

(C) Pfizer Exchange Agreement On or around the date of this Prospectus, Pfizer, Anacor and the Company entered into an exchange agreement (the \" Pfizer Exchange Agreement \") pursuant to which Pfizer will, conditional on completion of the Demerger, transfer all of its interests in PFCHH(the company that holds 32 per cent. of the ordinary shares in CH JVCo) to theCompany in exchange for the issuance by the Company of Haleon Shares to Pfizerand the Depositary (on behalf of Pfizer), representing in aggregate 32 per cent. of theissued and outstanding Haleon Shares immediately following Separation (to thenearest whole Haleon Share), and 25 million Non-Voting Preference Shares. Following completion of the Demerger Agreement and the Exchange Agreements summarised above, the Company will, indirectly, own 100 per cent. of CH JVCo. 15.10 Pfizer Relationship Agreement The relationship agreement between the Company and Pfizer was entered into as a deed on or around the date of this Prospectus (the \" Pfizer Relationship Agreement \").

Any loan drawn under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the aggregate of: (i) the applicable risk free rate (being the Bank of England's SterlingOvernight Interbank Average Rate ('SONIA')); and (ii) a margin determined inaccordance with the terms of the Term Loan Facility, which is dependent on thecorporate rating assigned to the Company. The Term Loan Facility is made available on customary 'certain funds' terms and the proceeds of any utilisation under the Term Loan Facility are available for use, directlyor indirectly, towards the payment of the Pre-Demerger Dividend. The Term LoanFacility has a maturity date falling 36 months after the date on which it was enteredinto. The Term Loan Facility requires CH JVCo and, from the point at which it accedes to the Term Loan Facility, the Company to make certain customary representations andwarranties at various times throughout the term of the Term Loan Facility. In addition,the Term Loan Facility contains customary restrictions on the operations of CH JVCo,the Group and, from the point at which it accedes to the Term Loan Facility, theCompany. These include customary positive and negative covenants, including anegative pledge and, with effect from the GSK Share Exchange, restrictions ondisposals. The Term Loan Facility does not contain any financial covenants, but CHJVCo and, from the point at which it accedes to the Term Loan Facility, the Companyare required to comply with certain information covenants, including the delivery offinancial information. The Term Loan Facility contains customary events of default, including cross- acceleration provisions. The occurrence of any event of default under the Term LoanFacility at a time when any amount is outstanding under the Term Loan Facility wouldpermit, amongst other things, the acceleration of such amounts. 15.14 Transition Services Agreement In connection with the Separation, GlaxoSmithKline Services Unlimited, GlaxoSmithKline LLC, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (Overseas) Limited and GlaxoSmithKline ConsumerHealthcare Holdings (US) LLC entered into a Transition Services Agreement on or around thedate of this Prospectus (the \" Transition Services Agreement \"), pursuant to which each group will provide limited services to the other on commercial terms and on an arms' length basis fora transitional period, effective from completion of the Demerger. 312 Under the Transition Services Agreement, the GSK Group will provide services to the Group including: (i) the continued provision of and access to technology applications and platforms;(ii) the continued provision of various back office services and support across finance, facilitiesand office space; (iii) supply chain (including quality, warehouse, distribution and logisticssupport); and (iv) certain other services, including regulatory compliance andpharmacovigilance.

The Company expects to conduct an audit tender process for the audit of the Company's financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2023, which would be subject toshareholder approval at the Company's 2023 annual general meeting. 20. FRUSTRATING ACTIONS, MANDATORY BIDS AND COMPULSORY ACQUISITION RULES RELATING TO ORDINARY SHARES Other than as provided by the City Code and Chapter 28 of the Companies Act, there are no rules or provisions relating to frustrating actions, mandatory bids and/or squeeze-out andsell-out rules relating to the Company. 20.1 Frustrating actions The City Code applies to the Company. During the course of an offer period, or when the board has reason to believe that a bona fide offer may be imminent, Rule 21.1 of the City Codeprohibits the board from taking any action which may result in an offer or bona fide possibleoffer being frustrated, or in shareholders being denied the opportunity to decide on its merits,or from taking certain frustrating actions, without the approval of shareholders in a generalmeeting . 315 20.2 Mandatory bids Rule 9.1 of the City Code states that, except with the consent of the Takeover Panel, when: (A) any person acquires, whether by a series of transactions over a period of time or not, an interest in shares which (taken together with shares in which persons acting inconcert with that person are interested) carry 30 per cent. or more of the voting rightsof a company; or (B) any person, together with persons acting in concert with that person, is interested in shares which in the aggregate carry not less than 30 per cent. of the voting rights of acompany, but does not hold shares carrying more than 50 per cent. of such votingrights, and such person, or any persons acting in concert with that person, acquires aninterest in any other shares which increases the percentage of the shares carryingvoting rights in which that person is interested, such person shall extend offers, on the basis set out in Rules 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 of the City Code, to the holders of any class of equity share capital whether voting or non-voting and also to theholders of any other class of transferable securities carrying voting rights. Offers for differentclasses of equity share capital must be comparable and the Takeover Panel should beconsulted in advance in such cases. Persons acting in concert (and concert parties) comprise persons who, pursuant to an agreement or understanding (whether formal or informal), co-operate to obtain or consolidatecontrol of a company or to frustrate the successful outcome of an offer for a company. Certaincategories of people are deemed under the City Code to be acting in concert with each otherunless the contrary is established. \"Interests in shares\" is defined broadly in the City Code. A person who has long economic exposure, whether absolute or conditional, to changes in the price of shares will be treated asinterested in those shares. A person who only has a short position in shares will not be treatedas interested in those shares. \"Voting rights\" for these purposes means all the voting rights attributable to the share capital of a company which are then exercisable at a general meeting. 20.3 Authority of the Company to redeem or purchase its own shares When a company redeems or purchases its own voting shares, under Rule 37 of the City Code any resulting increase in the percentage of shares carrying voting rights in which a person orgroup of persons acting in concert is interested will be treated as an acquisition for the purposeof Rule 9 of the City Code. Rule 37 of the City Code provides that, subject to prior consultation,the Takeover Panel will normally waive any resulting obligation to make a general offer if thereis a vote of independent shareholders and a procedure along the lines of that set out inAppendix 1 to the City Code is followed. Appendix 1 to the City Code sets out the procedurewhich should be followed in obtaining that consent of independent shareholders. Under Note 1on Rule 37.1 of the City Code, a person who comes to exceed the limits in Rule 9.1 inconsequence of a company's redemption or purchase of its own shares will not normally incuran obligation to make a mandatory offer unless that person is a director, or the relationship ofthe person with any one or more of the directors is such that the person is, or is presumed tobe, acting in concert with any of the directors. A person who has appointed a representative tothe board of the company will be treated for these purposes as a director. However, there is nopresumption that all the directors (or any two or more directors) are acting in concert solely byreason of a proposed redemption or purchase by a company of its own shares, or the decisionto seek shareholders' authority for any such purchase. For so long as the Pfizer Directors (orany other directors nominated by Pfizer or its concert parties from time to time) are director(s)of the Company, Note 1 on Rule 37.1 of the City Code will not exempt Pfizer (or its concertparties) from the effects of Rule 37.1 of the City Code. 316 Under Note 2 on Rule 37.1 of the City Code, the exception in Note 1 on Rule 37.1 described above will not apply, and an obligation to make a mandatory offer may therefore be imposed, ifa person (or any relevant member of a group of persons acting in concert) has acquired aninterest in shares at a time when they had reason to believe that such a redemption orpurchase by the company of its own shares would take place. Note 2 will not normally berelevant unless the relevant person knows that a purchase for which requisite shareholderauthority exists is being, or is likely to be, implemented (whether in whole or in part). The Takeover Panel must be consulted in advance in any case where Rule 9 of the City Code might be relevant. This will include any case where a person or group of persons acting inconcert is interested in shares carrying 30 per cent. or more but does not hold shares carryingmore than 50 per cent. of the voting rights of a company, or may become interested in 30 percent. or more on full implementation of the proposed purchase or redemption by the companyof its own shares. In addition, the Takeover Panel should always be consulted if the aggregateinterests in shares of the directors and any other persons acting in concert, or presumed to beacting in concert, with any of the directors amount to 30 per cent. or more, or may be increasedto 30 per cent. or more on full implementation of the proposed purchase or redemption by thecompany of its own shares. Subject to certain limits, the Company has authority to purchase Haleon Shares under the terms of the shareholder resolution summarised in paragraph 4.6 of this Part XII ( Additional Information ) above (the \" Buyback Authority \"). The maximum aggregate number of Haleon Shares authorised to be purchased under the Buyback Authority is 10 per cent. of theCompany's issued share capital immediately following Admission (subject to the conditionssummarised in paragraph 4.6 of this Part XII ( Additional Information ) above). The Buyback Authority is due to expire at the conclusion of the first annual general meeting of the Company (or, if earlier, at the close of business on 30 June 2023) but, in each case, so thatthe Company may, before the expiry of the Buyback Authority, enter into a contract topurchase Haleon Shares which will or may be executed wholly or partly after the expiry of suchBuyback Authority. If, prior to such expiry: (a) the Company were to exercise the Buyback Authority in full; (b) the aggregate percentage beneficial holding of Pfizer in the Company immediately followingAdmission is approximately 32 per cent. of the issued share capital of the Company; and(c) none of the Haleon Shares which Pfizer holds are purchased by the Company under theBuyback Authority and no Haleon Shares have been newly issued by the Company betweenthe date of Admission and the date that the Buyback Authority is fully exercised, then theshareholding of Pfizer in the Company would increase to approximately 35.56 per cent. Thisincrease would be less to the extent that any of the Haleon Shares held by Pfizer arepurchased by the Company. In the present case, if the Company were to exercise its Buyback Authority then the effect of Rule 37.1 of the City Code is that, unless independent Haleon Shareholders approve a waiverof Rule 9 or the Takeover Panel grants a dispensation, a mandatory offer by Pfizer under Rule9 would be required. In respect of the period from Admission up to the conclusion of the first annual general meeting of the Company (or, if earlier, at the close of business on 30 June 2023), the Takeover Panelhas confirmed that, notwithstanding Rule 37.1 of the City Code, any potential increase in theshareholding of Pfizer in the Company as a result of the exercise of the Buyback Authority willnot require Pfizer to make a mandatory offer pursuant to Rule 9 of the City Code, and thereforea resolution of the independent shareholders of the Company will not be necessary. Thisconfirmation has been given on the basis that: (a) the Buyback Authority was passed on23 May 2022; and (b) the consequences of any buyback pursuant to the Buyback Authorityhave been fully disclosed in this Prospectus. For so long as Pfizer holds in aggregate an interest in 30 per cent. or more of the voting rights in the Company and subject (where necessary) to the prior consent of the Takeover Panel, theCompany has undertaken to procure that at the first annual general meeting of the Company 317 and thereafter once in every calendar year, the Company will propose to its independent shareholders a resolution to waive, in accordance with Appendix 1 to the City Code, allobligations of Pfizer to make a mandatory offer under Rule 9 that may otherwise arise as aresult of the Company purchasing or effecting any other transaction in relation to the HaleonShares. 20.4 Squeeze-out rules Under the Companies Act, if a \"takeover offer\" (as defined in section 974 of the Companies Act) is made by an offeror to acquire all of the shares in the Company not already owned by itand the offeror were to acquire, or unconditionally contract to acquire, not less than 90 percent. in value of the shares to which such offer relates, and not less than 90 per cent. of thevoting rights attached to such shares, within three months of the last day on which its offer canbe accepted, the offeror could then compulsorily acquire the remaining shares not assented tothe offer. The offeror would do so by sending a notice to the outstanding members informingthem that it will compulsorily acquire their shares and, six weeks later, it would deliver atransfer of the outstanding shares in its favour to the Company which would execute thetransfers on behalf of the relevant members, and pay the consideration for the outstandingshares to the Company which would hold the consideration on trust for the relevant members.The consideration offered to the members whose shares are compulsorily acquired under thisprocedure must, in general, be the same as the consideration that was available under theoriginal offer unless a member can show that the offer value is unfair. 20.5 Sell-out rules The Companies Act also gives minority members a right to be bought out in certain circumstances by an offeror who has made a takeover offer. If a takeover offer related to all theshares in the Company and, at any time before the end of the period within which the offercould be accepted, the offeror held or had agreed to acquire not less than 90 per cent. in valueof the shares and not less than 90 per cent. of the voting rights carried by the shares in theCompany, any holder of shares to which the offer related who had not accepted the offer couldby a written communication to the offeror require it to acquire those shares. The offeror wouldbe required to give any member notice of his or her right to be bought out within one month ofthat right arising. The offeror may impose a time limit on the rights of minority members to bebought out, but that period cannot end less than three months after the end of the acceptanceperiod or, if later, three months from the date on which notice is served on members notifyingthem of their sell-out rights. If a member exercises his or her rights, the offeror is entitled andbound to acquire those shares on the terms of the offer or on such other terms as may beagreed. 21. LIMITATIONS ON ENFORCEMENT OF US LAWS The Company is a global consumer healthcare products company domiciled in the UK. Many of the Directors and executive officers (as well as certain directors, managers and executiveofficers of the Company's finance subsidiaries) reside outside the USA, and a substantialportion of the Group's assets and the assets of such persons are located outside the USA. Asa result, it may be difficult for holders of Haleon Shares to serve legal process on the Companyor the Directors and executive officers or have any of them appear in a US court. There issome doubt as to the enforceability in the UK, in original actions or in actions for enforcementof judgments of US courts, of civil liabilities based solely on the federal securities laws of theUSA. In addition, awards for punitive damages in actions brought in the USA or elsewhere maybe unenforceable in the UK. 22.

Presentation of the Historical Financial Information1.1 General information GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings (No.2) Limited (\" CHHL2 \") and its subsidiary undertakings (collectively, the \" CH Group \") is a group of companies focused on developing and marketing a range of Oral Health, Pain Relief, Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements,Respiratory Health, Digestive Health and Other products for people in more than 100 countries.CHHL2 is a private limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom on 24 April 2019 as asubsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline plc. (\" GSK Group \") and is a limited company registered in England and Wales. The registered office is located at 980 Great West Road, Brentford,Middlesex, TW8 9GS, United Kingdom. The consolidated Historical Financial Information of the CH Group, as described further below, for the three years ended 31 December 2021 (the \" Historical Financial Information \") has been prepared specifically for the purposes of this Prospectus and in accordance withRegulation (EU) 2017/1129 as supplemented by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)2019/980 each as they form part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the EUWithdrawal Act 2018 and in accordance with the basis of preparation set out below. 1.2 Perimeter and basis of preparation The consolidated Historical Financial Information comprises the CH Group for the three years ended 31 December 2019, 2020 and 2021. The legal entities contained within the CH Groupare set out in Note 38. On 19 December 2018, GSK Group reached an agreement with Pfizer Inc. (\" Pfizer \") to combine their respective consumer health businesses into a new world-leading Joint Venture(the \" GSK-Pfizer Joint Venture \" or the \" JV\") (the \" Pfizer Transaction \"). Subsequent to the Pfizer Transaction, GSK Group held and still holds a majority controlling equity interest of 68%in the CH Group whilst Pfizer held and still holds a non-controlling equity interest of 32% in theCH Group. The Pfizer Transaction was completed on 31 July 2019 and the Pfizer consumer health business was consolidated and included in the CH Group's consolidated Historical FinancialInformation from that date. Pfizer, GSK Group and CHHL2 entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement as amended on 31 July 2019 (the \" SAPA \"). The SAPA reflected the fact that the majority of GSK's consumer healthcare business already sat within a relatively standalone corporate structurewithin GSK Group, and under the terms of the SAPA, Pfizer agreed to transfer its consumerhealthcare business into GSK's consumer healthcare business. Basis of preparationThe consolidated Historical Financial Information has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the InternationalAccounting Standards Board (\" IASB IFRS \") and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom (\" UK IFRS \") (together \" IFRS \"). The CH Group is comprised predominantly of, but not entirely, a group of legal entities during the periods presented and the consolidated Historical Financial Information reflects the assets,liabilities and results of operations that represented Consumer Healthcare within GSK Group(\"GSK Consumer Healthcare \"). 347 The following summarises the basis of accounting applied in preparing the consolidated Historical Financial Information: \u0081 The CH Group's Historical Financial Information has been prepared following the principles of IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements, and comprise the assets andliabilities, income and expenses, equity and reserves and cash flows for a certain groupof legal entities within GSK Consumer Healthcare business, as contemplated by theSAPA, from 1 January 2019 to 31 July 2019 and the newly formed GSK-Pfizer JointVenture from 1 August 2019 onwards. \u0081 On 20 June 2019, the existing GSK Consumer Healthcare entities identified within the SAPA were transferred from GSK Group to CHHL2. The transfer of these investments toCHHL2 was accounted for as a reorganisation of entities under common control.Accordingly, all assets, liabilities and results of operations are recorded at their carryingvalues within the GSK Group from 1 January 2019 to 20 June 2019 representing thecontinuation of GSK's Consumer Healthcare business and hence the Historical FinancialInformation for this period has been prepared on a consolidated basis. \u0081 On 31 July 2019, the Pfizer Transaction closed and CHHL2 acquired Pfizer's consumer healthcare business. The acquired assets and liabilities were accounted for under IFRS 3at fair value. \u0081 All intercompany transactions have been eliminated between subsidiaries of the CH Group. Transactions and balances between the CH Group and the rest of the GSK Grouprepresent third-party transactions and balances from the perspective of the CH Group.They have been presented alongside third-party transactions and balances in theappropriate financial statement line items of the consolidated Historical FinancialInformation to which such transactions and balances relate as well as being disclosed asrelated party transactions. The consolidated Historical Financial Information presented herein does not necessarily reflect what the operating results and cash flows would have been had the CH Group been astandalone group for all periods presented. The accounting policies applied and disclosed below are consistent with those to be used by the CH Group in its next annual financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2022and these policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented unless statedotherwise. The consolidated Historical Financial Information is presented in Sterling (\" GBP \", \"\u00a3\"), the functional currency of CHHL2 and presentation currency of the CH Group, and all valuesstated in millions of GBP (\" \u00a3m\"), except where otherwise indicated, and have been prepared on the historical cost basis, unless otherwise indicated in the accounting policies. The consolidated Historical Financial Information does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434(3) of the Companies Act 2006. Going concernThe consolidated Historical Financial Information has been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, unless otherwise indicated in the accounting policiesbelow. The directors of the CH Group have reviewed cash flow forecasts and trading budgetsand after making appropriate enquiries, have formed the view that the CH Group will generatesufficient cash to meet its ongoing requirements for at least the next 12 months; accordingly,the going concern basis of preparation has been adopted. 348 2. Accounting principles and policies (a) ConsolidationEntities over which the CH Group has the power to direct the relevant activities so as to affect the returns to the CH Group, generally through control over the financial and operating policiesfrom either voting or contractual rights, are accounted for as subsidiaries. Interests acquired inentities are consolidated from the date the CH Group acquires control and interests sold arede-consolidated from the date control ceases. Where, as part of a business combination, the CH Group is not able to exercise control over a particular operation due to the existence of legal or other restrictions, the associated assetsand liabilities are not consolidated, and a financial asset or liability is recognised for theeconomic benefit or obligation to be received under the contribution agreement. The assetsand liabilities are consolidated, and the associated financial asset or liability derecognised, onthe date at which the CH Group is able to exercise control over these operations. Transactions and balances between subsidiaries are eliminated and no profit before tax is recognised on sales between subsidiaries until the products are sold to customers outside theCH Group. Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity. Deferredtax relief on unrealised intra-group profit is accounted for only to the extent that it is consideredrecoverable. (b) Business combinationsBusiness combinations where common control exists at the time of the transaction relate to businesses that were controlled by a part of the GSK Group, other than the CH Group and thenas a result of the combination were transferred into the CH Group at some point during theperiods covered by the Historical Financial Information. Such business combinations areaccounted for by recognising all assets and liabilities acquired at their previous carrying valueswithin the GSK Group with effect from the beginning of the earliest period reported in theHistorical Financial Information. No new goodwill arises from such transactions. Business combinations where common control does not exist before the transaction are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method. Identifiable assets, liabilities andcontingent liabilities acquired are measured at fair value at acquisition date. The considerationtransferred is measured at fair value and includes the fair value of any contingentconsideration. Where the consideration transferred, together with the non-controlling interest,exceeds the fair value of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the excessis recorded as goodwill, denominated in the currency of the operation acquired. The costs related to business combinations are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Where not all the equity of a subsidiary is acquired thenon-controlling interest is recognised either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest'sshare of the net assets of the subsidiary, on a case-by-case basis. Changes in the CH Group's ownership percentage of subsidiaries are accounted for within equity. (c) Foreign currency translationForeign currency transactions are booked in the functional currency of the relevant company at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets andliabilities are retranslated into the functional currency at rates of exchange ruling at the balancesheet date. Exchange differences are included in the income statement. On consolidation, assets and liabilities, including related goodwill, of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The results andcash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling using average rates ofexchange. 349 Exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the period retained by overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling are recognised in OtherComprehensive Income. (d) RevenueThe CH Group receives revenue for supply of goods to external customers against orders received. The majority of contracts that the CH Group enters into relate to sales orderscontaining single performance obligations for the delivery of consumer healthcare products.The average duration of a sales order is less than 12 months. Product revenue is recognised when control of the goods is passed to the customer. The point at which control passes is determined by each customer arrangement, but generally occurs ondelivery to the customer. Product revenue represents net invoice value including fixed and variable consideration. Variable consideration arises on the sale of goods as a result of discounts and allowancesgiven and accruals for estimated future returns and rebates. Revenue is not recognised in fulluntil it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenuerecognised will not occur. The methodology and assumptions used to estimate rebates andreturns are monitored and adjusted regularly in the light of contractual and legal obligations,historical trends, past experience and projected market conditions. Once the uncertaintyassociated with the returns and rebates is resolved, revenue is adjusted accordingly. Valueadded tax and other sales taxes are excluded from revenue. (e) ExpenditureExpenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms. Provision is made when an obligation exists for a futureliability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliablyestimated. Manufacturing start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normalproduction are expensed as incurred. Advertising and promotion expenditure are charged tothe income statement as incurred. Shipment costs on intercompany transfers are charged tocost of sales, distribution costs on sales to customers are included in selling, general andadministrative (\" SG&A \") expenditure. Restructuring costs are recognised and provided for, where appropriate, in respect of the direct expenditure of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and welladvanced, and where a valid expectation to those affected has been created by either startingto implement the restructuring plans or announcing its main features. (f) Research and developmentResearch and development (\" R&D \") expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. R&D expenditure comprises expenditure that is directlyattributable to the research and development of new products, including the costs attributableto the generation of intellectual property and product registrations, depreciation andamortisation of equipment, real estate and IT assets used by the R&D function. Developmentexpenditure is capitalised from when the required regulatory approvals to launch a new productare obtained and the criteria for recognising an asset are met. Property, plant and equipmentused for research and development is capitalised and depreciated in accordance with the CHGroup's policy described below. (g) Legal and other disputesProvision is made for the anticipated settlement costs of legal or other disputes against the CH Group where an outflow of resources is considered probable, and a reliable estimate can bemade of the likely outcome. 350 The CH Group may become involved in legal proceedings, in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that could result fromultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases, appropriate disclosure about such caseswould be included but no provision would be made. Costs associated with claims made by theCH Group against third parties are charged to the income statement as they are incurred. (h) Pensions and other post-employment benefitsThe costs of providing pensions under defined benefit schemes are calculated using the projected unit credit method and spread over the period during which benefit is expected to bederived from the employees' services, consistent with the advice of qualified actuaries. Pensionobligations are measured as the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted atrates reflecting the yields of high-quality corporate bonds. Pension scheme assets aremeasured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The costs of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in a similar way to defined benefit pension schemes and spread over the period during which benefit is expected to be derivedfrom the employees' services, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries. Future cashflows discounted at rates reflecting the yields of high-quality corporate bonds. Pension schemeassets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. The CH Group's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as incurred. (i) Employee share plansIncentives, in the form of shares in the CH Group's ultimate parent company, GlaxoSmithKline plc, are provided to employees under share option and share award schemes. These schemesare operated by GSK affiliates. The fair values of these options and awards are calculated at their grant dates using a Black- Scholes option pricing model and charged to the income statement over the relevant vestingperiods. At the end of each reporting period, the GSK Group reviews its charge and revises itaccordingly based on the number of options expected to vest. (j) Property, plant and equipmentProperty, plant and equipment (\" PP&E \") is stated at the cost of purchase or construction less provisions for depreciation and impairment. Financing costs are capitalised within the cost ofqualifying assets under construction. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less residual value of PP&E, excluding freehold land, using the straight-line basis over the expected useful life. Residual values and lives arereviewed, and where appropriate adjusted, annually. The normal expected useful lives of themajor categories of PP&E are: Freehold buildings 20 to 50 years Leasehold land and buildings Lease term or 20 to 50 yearsPlant and machinery 10 to 20 yearsEquipment and vehicles 3 to 10 years On disposal of PP&E, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and impairments are removed from the Historical Financial Information and the net amount, less any proceeds, istaken to the income statement. 351 (k) Intangible assets GoodwillGoodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the CH Group's share of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiredsubsidiaries at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or morefrequently where indicators of impairment exist and is carried at cost less any accumulatedimpairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (\" CGU \") for the purpose of impairment testing. A CGU is identified at the lowest aggregation of assets that generate largely independent cashinflows, and that which is looked at by management for monitoring and managing the business.If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss isallocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then tothe other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in theunit. Any impairment is immediately recognised in the consolidated income statement and animpairment loss recognised for goodwill is not subsequently reversed. On disposal, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal. Other intangible assetsIntangible assets are stated at cost less provisions for amortisation and impairments.Licences, patents, know-how and marketing rights separately acquired or acquired as part of a business combination are amortised over their estimated useful lives, generally not exceeding20 years, using the straight-line basis from the time they are available for use. The estimateduseful lives for determining the amortisation charge consider patent lives, where applicable, aswell as the value obtained from periods of non-exclusivity. Asset lives are reviewed and, whereappropriate, adjusted annually. Any development costs incurred by the CH Group and associated with acquired licences, patents, know-how or marketing rights are written off to the income statement when incurred,unless the criteria for recognition of an internally generated intangible asset are met, usuallywhen a regulatory filing has been made in a major market and approval is considered highlyprobable. Acquired brands are valued independently as part of the fair value of businesses acquired from third parties where the brand has a value which is substantial and long term and where thebrands either are contractual or legal in nature or can be sold separately from the rest of thebusinesses acquired. Brands are amortised over their estimated useful lives of up to 20 years,except where it is considered that the useful economic life is indefinite. The costs of acquiring and developing computer software for internal use and internet sites for external use are capitalised as intangible fixed assets where the software or site supports asignificant business system and the expenditure leads to the creation of an asset. ERPsystems software is amortised over seven to ten years and other computer software over threeto five years. (l) LeasesThe CH Group recognises right of use assets under lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less)and leases of low value assets. Rights to use assets owned by third parties under leasearrangements are capitalised at the inception of the lease and recognised on the balancesheet. The corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a lease obligation within shortand long-term borrowings. The carrying amount is subsequently increased to reflect interest onthe lease liability and reduced by lease payments made. 352 For calculating the discounted lease liability on leases with annual payments of \u00a32 million or more, the implicit rate in the lease is used. If this is not available, the incremental borrowingrate with a lease specific adjustment is used. If neither of these is available, and for leases withannual payments of less than \u00a32 million, the incremental borrowing rate is calculated at therate of interest at which the CH Group would have been able to borrow for a similar term andwith a similar security the funds necessary to obtain a similar asset in a similar market. Finance costs are charged to the income statement to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligations for each accounting period. Variable rents are not part of the lease liability and the right of use asset. These payments are charged to the income statement as incurred. Short-term and low value leases are notcapitalised, and lease rentals are also charged to the income statement as incurred. Non-lease components are accounted for separately from the lease components in plant and equipment leases but are not separately accounted for in land and buildings or vehicle leases. If modifications or reassessments occur, the lease liability and right of use asset are re-measured. Right of use assets where title is expected to pass to the CH Group at a point in the future are depreciated on a basis constant with similar owned assets. In other cases, right of use assetsare depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. (m) Impairment of non-current assetsThe carrying values of all non-current assets are reviewed for impairment, either on a stand- alone basis or as part of a larger CGU, when there is an indication that the assets might beimpaired. Additionally, goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangibleassets which are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. Any provision forimpairment is charged to the income statement. Impairments of goodwill are not reversed. Impairment losses on other non-current assets are only reversed if there has been a change in estimates used to determine recoverable amountsand only to the extent that the revised recoverable amounts do not exceed the carrying valuesthat would have existed, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairments beenrecognised. (n) InventoriesInventories are included in the Historical Financial Information at the lower of cost (including raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads) and netrealisable value. Cost is determined on a first in, first out basis. (o) Trade payablesTrade payables are initially recognised at fair value and then held at amortised cost. Long-term payables are discounted where the effect is material. (p) TaxationCurrent tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid applying tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. A separate return approach isused for calculating income tax provisions and related deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Historical Financial Information. 353 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax isprovided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where thetiming of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that thetemporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is provided usingrates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. (q) Financial instrumentsFinancial assetsFinancial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The measurement basis isdetermined by reference to both the business model for managing the financial asset and thecontractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. For financial assets other than tradereceivables a 12-month expected credit loss (ECL) allowance is recorded on initial recognition.If there is subsequent evidence of a significant increase in the credit risk of an asset, theallowance is increased to reflect the full lifetime ECL. If there is no realistic prospect ofrecovery, the asset is written off. Trade receivablesTrade receivables are measured in accordance with the business model under which each portfolio of trade receivables is held. The CH Group has portfolios in two of the three businessmodels under IFRS 9 to collect the contractual cash flows (measured at amortised cost) and tosell the contractual cash flows (measured at FVTPL). Trade receivables measured at amortised cost are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances for ECL. ECLs are calculated in accordance with the simplified approach permittedby IFRS 9, using a provision matrix applying lifetime historical credit loss experience to thetrade receivables. The ECL rate varies depending on whether and the extent to whichsettlement of the trade receivables is overdue and it is also adjusted as appropriate to reflectcurrent economic conditions and estimates of future conditions. For the purpose of determiningcredit loss rates, customers are classified into groupings that have similar loss patterns. Thekey drivers of the loss rate are the location and type of customer. When a trade receivable is determined to have no reasonable expectation of recovery it is written off, firstly against any expected credit loss allowance available and then to the incomestatement. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously provided for or written off are credited to the income statement. Long-term receivables are discounted where the effect is material. Cash and cash equivalentsCash held in deposit accounts is measured at amortised cost. Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term highlyliquid deposits with a maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to a knownamount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. BorrowingsAll borrowings are initially recorded at the amount of proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between theproceeds, net of transaction costs, and the amount due on redemption being recognised as acharge to the income statement over the period of the relevant borrowing. 354 Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks. The principal derivative instruments used by the CH Group are forward foreign exchange contracts andswaps. The CH Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading orspeculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments are classified as held-for-trading and are measured at fair value. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are classified on inception as cash flowhedges, net investment hedges or fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedges are effective. Ineffective portionsare recognised in profit or loss immediately. Amounts deferred in other comprehensive incomeare reclassified to the income statement when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Net investment hedges are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges.Changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability.Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accountingare recognised immediately in the income statement. 3. Key accounting judgements and estimates In preparing the consolidated Historical Financial Information, management is required to make judgements about when or how items should be recognised in the consolidated HistoricalFinancial Information and estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets,liabilities, income and expenses reported in the consolidated Historical Financial Information.Actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates. The following are the criticalaccounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty. TaxationEstimatesManagement makes the judgement of whether there is sufficient information to be able to make a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute. If insufficient information is available,no provision is made. If sufficient information is available, in estimating a potential tax liability, the CH Group applies a risk-based approach to determine the transactions most likely to be subject to challenge,assuming that the relevant tax authority will review and have full knowledge of all the relevantinformation, and the probability that the CH Group would be able to obtain compensatoryadjustments under international tax treaties. These estimates consider the specificcircumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, are inherently judgemental andcould change substantially over time as each dispute progresses and new facts emerge. Further details and the factors affecting the tax charge in future years are set out in Note 13, 'Taxation'. Where open tax matters exist, the ultimate liability for such matters may vary fromthe amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of negotiations with the relevant taxauthorities or, if necessary, litigation proceedings. At 31 December 2021, the CH Group hadrecognised provisions of \u00a3150 million in respect of such uncertain tax positions (2020:\u00a3124 million and 2019: \u00a3123 million). Due to the number of uncertain tax positions held and thenumber of jurisdictions to which these relate, it is not practicable to give meaningful sensitivityestimates. 355 Indefinite life brands EstimatesEstimation of recoverable amount of indefinite life brands. The CH Group tests at least annually whether indefinite life brands have suffered any impairment, in accordance with theaccounting policy. The recoverable amounts of indefinite life brands have been determinedbased on fair value less costs of disposal model. These calculations require the use ofestimates and assumptions consistent with the most up to date budgets and plans that havebeen formally approved by management and are based on discounted cash flow forecastsusing estimated long-term growth rates. The key assumptions used and sensitivity analysis aredisclosed in Note 18, 'Intangible assets'. Legal and other disputesJudgement and estimatesManagement makes a judgement of whether it is remote, possible or probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle legal obligations. To theextent that the potential outflow is assessed as possible but not probable or insufficientinformation is available to make a judgement on whether a potential outflow is probable, noprovision is made and disclosure related to the claim is provided. For legal obligations that are assessed as leading to a probable outflow and sufficient information is available, the estimated provisions take into account the specific circumstancesof each dispute and relevant external advice, are inherently judgemental and could changesubstantially over time as each dispute progresses and new facts emerge. Details of the statusand various uncertainties involved in the significant unresolved disputes are set out in Note 27,'Contingent Liabilities'. The CH Group's Directors, having taken legal advice, have establishedprovisions after taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and inaccordance with accounting requirements. The CH Group may become involved in legal proceedings, in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the expected financial effect, or practicable to give a meaningfulrange of outcomes that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases,appropriate disclosure about such cases would be provided, but no provision would be madeand no contingent liability can be quantified. The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary fromthe amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings,investigations, and possible settlement negotiations. The position could change over time and,therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legalproceedings will not exceed the amount of the provisions reported in the Group's financialstatements by a material amount. 4. Adoption of new and revised standards In 2020, the CH Group implemented an amendment to IFRS 3 'Business combinations' which was issued in October 2018. The amendment clarifies the definition of a business and permitsa simplified initial assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a group ofassets rather than a business. The amendment did not have a material impact on the results orfinancial position of the CH Group in 2020. 'Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16)' was issued in May 2020. It introduces a practical expedient to IFRS 16 'Leases' which permits a lessee to elect not toassess whether a COVID-19-related concession in respect of rent due for periods to 30 June2021 is a lease modification. The amendment is applicable for annual reporting periodsbeginning on or after 1 June 2020 and earlier application is permitted. The amendment did nothave a material impact on the results or financial position of the CH Group in 2020. 356 The CH Group previously accounted for SaaS (software as a service) configuration and customisation costs as intangible assets. Following the IFRS IC (Interpretation Committee)agenda decision on SaaS in April 2021, the CH Group has adopted the treatment set out in theIFRS IC agenda decision and expensed configuration and customisation costs where the entitydoes not control the software being configured. The impact of the change has not had amaterial impact on the results or financial position of the CH Group. Where the retirement benefit to which an employee is entitled is capped at a specified number of consecutive years, the CH Group previously accounted for these employee benefits from theemployment commencement date. Following the IFRS IC agenda decision on AttributingBenefit to Periods of Service in May 2021, the CH Group has adopted the treatment set out inthe IFRS IC agenda decision to account for the employee benefits during the last specifiednumber of years where the employee earn the benefit. The impact of the change has not had amaterial impact on the results or financial position of the CH Group. During the year, the CH Group implemented 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16' which was issued in August2020. The amendments address issues that arise from implementation of the reforms,including the replacement of one benchmark with an alternative one. A practical expedient isprovided such that the change to contractual cash flows for financial assets and liabilities(including lease liabilities) is accounted for prospectively by revising the effective interest rate.In addition, hedge accounting will not be discontinued solely because of the IBOR reform.Further information is provided in note 33. Certain new accounting standards, amendments to accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2021 reporting periods and havenot been early adopted by the CH Group. These standards, amendments or interpretations arenot expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods. 5. Exchange rates The CH Group operates in many countries and earns revenues and incurs costs in many currencies. The results of the CH Group, as reported in Sterling, are affected by movements inexchange rates between Sterling and other currencies. Average exchange rates, as modifiedby specific transaction rates for large transactions, prevailing during the year, are used totranslate the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries into Sterling. Year-end rates areused to translate the net assets of those entities. The currencies which most influenced thesetranslations and the relevant exchange rates were: Average rates Period end rates 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Average rates: USD/\u00a3 1.38 1.29 1.28 1.35 1.36 1.32 Euro/\u00a3 1.16 1.13 1.14 1.19 1.11 1.18Swiss Franc/\u00a3 1.25 1.21 1.23 1.20 1.28 CNY/\u00a3 8.86 8.91 8.82 8.56 8.93 9.19 6. Revenue and segment information Analysis of revenue by geography is included below, the composition of these geographical segments is reviewed on an annual basis. For management reporting purposes, the CH Group is organised into business units based on geographical areas and has three reportable segments, as follows: \u0081 North America\u0081 Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America (EMEA and LatAm)\u0081 Asia Pacific (APAC) 357 No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments. The primary products sold by each of the reportable segments consist of Oral Health, Pain Relief, Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements, Respiratory Health, Digestive Health and Otherproducts and the product portfolio is consistent across the reportable segments. The Commercial Operations Board is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\" CODM \") who monitors the operating results of the Group's business units separately for the purpose ofmaking decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. The CODM uses ameasure of adjusted operating profit to assess the performance of the reportable segments.Adjusted Operating Profit is defined as operating profit less net intangible amortisation andimpairment of brands, licenses, and patents, restructuring costs, transaction related costs,separation and admission costs, and disposals and other disposal related adjusting costs. TheCODM does not review IFRS operating profit or total assets on a segment basis. 2021 2020 2019 Revenue by segment \u00a3m \u00a3m North America 857 746APAC 461 377 311 Corporate other unallocated (77) (57) (63) 2,172 2,074 1,654 Reconciling items between adjusted operating profit and operating profit: Net amortisation and impairment of intangible assets 18,8 (16) (97) (36)Restructuring costs 12 (195) (411) (330)Transaction related costs 19 - (91) (366)Separation and admission costs 8 (278) (66) -Disposals and others 29 (45) 189 (25)Group operating profit 1,638 1,598 897Net finance costs (2) (7) (11) Profit before taxation 1,636 1,591 886 Net amortisation and impairment of intangible assets includes amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, excluding computer software, and impairment of goodwill, net of reversals ofimpairment.

Other operating (expense)/income In 2021, as part of the continued strategic review of the business, the CH Group sold several assets including Transderm Scop, Acne-Aid and Baldriparan. The CH net gain on disposals of \u00a331 million in the year. In 2020, as a result of the strategic review of the business, the CH Group sold several businesses and assets including Breathe Right, Physiogel, Coldrex, Venoruton, certainintellectual property rights of Horlicks and other assets and smaller businesses. Thermacarehas been disposed in 2020 to meet EMEA anti-trust requirements. The CH Group hasrecognised a total net gain on disposals of \u00a3212 million in the year. In 2019 Other operating expense includes net losses of \u00a317 million relating to the deal costs incurred for the disposal of intellectual property and businesses, mainly related to deal costspreparing Thermacare for the divestment. Certain Horlicks intellectual property rights amounting to \u00a316 million legally owned by an entity within the CH Group were disposed of in 2020. These intellectual property rights were legally 359 owned by an entity within the CH Group however the GSK Group has the beneficial title to these. The intellectual property rights were sold for \u00a374 million resulting in a gain on disposal of\u00a358 million. The proceeds of the sale were subsequently declared and paid as a dividend tothe GSK Group in 2020, refer to Note 14 'Dividends'. 8. Operating profit 2021 2020 2019 The following items have been included in operating profit: \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m 209 226 194Impairment of assets held for sale Intangible assets - 20 -Property, plant and equipment - 3 - Net foreign exchange losses 11 12 7Short term lease charge 1 1 1Separation and admission costs 278 66 - Separation and admission costs represent costs incurred in relation to and in connection with the separation and potential listing of the CH Group as a standalone business. These costs arenot directly attributable to the sale of the CH Group's products and specifically relate to theactivities mentioned above, affecting comparability of the CH Group's financial results inhistoric and future reporting periods. 9. Employee and Key Management Personnel costs 2021 2020 2019 \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m Wages and salaries 1,287 1,362 1,285 Social security costs 147 151 109Pension and other post-employment costs (Note 25) 30 30 29Cost of share-based incentive plans (Note 34) 59 63 58 Severance costs from integration and restructuring activities 95 77 89 1,618 1,683 1,570 The CH Group provides benefits to employees, commensurate with local practice in individual countries, including, in some markets, healthcare insurance, subsidised car schemes andpersonal life insurance. All individuals performing services for the CH Group are employed and remunerated by CH Group companies or other members of the GSK Group. Where a management charge forwages and salaries has been made from entities outside the CH Group, such amounts are notincluded in wages and salaries above as it is not practical to separate such amounts from othermanagement recharges. 360 Details of Key Management Personnel Key Management Personnel comprises the Executive board members and the Consumer Healthcare leadership team (\" CHLT \"). The compensation of Key Management Personnel in respect of their services to the CH Group in aggregate was as follows: 2021 2020 2019 \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m Wages and salaries 11.7 13.9 13.8 Social security costs 1.1 1.1 1.1Pension and other post-employment costs 1.7 1.6 1.4 Cost of share-based incentive plans 6.9 7.8 7.8 21.4 24.4 24.1 Retirement benefits accrued under defined benefit schemes sponsored by sister companies within the GSK Group for one director in 2021, two directors in 2020 and two directors in 2019.Two (2020: three, 2019: three) directors received share awards under long term incentiveplans in respect of qualifying services to the CH Group in 2021. 10.

Restructuring costs Restructuring costs mainly relate to initiatives announced since formation of the CH Group and include Personnel costs, impairments of tangible assets and computer software relating torestructuring programmes. Restructuring costs are those mainly related to specific Board-approved restructuring programmes, including integration costs following material acquisitions, which are structuraland are of a significant scale in terms of the costs of individual or related projects. In 2021, CHGroup defined such programmes to comprise of any projects exceeding \u00a315 million whilst inprior periods, this was determined to be any projects exceeding \u00a325 million. This change didnot result in any differences in the nature of restructuring programmes included as part ofrestructuring costs for 2020 and 2019. In 2021, Restructuring costs of \u00a3195 million (2020: \u00a3411 million, 2019: \u00a3330 million) have been charged to the income statement and recognised in the expense categories outlined below.Restructuring costs are mainly activities to generate synergies from the integration of Pfizer'sConsumer Healthcare business into the CH Group's business, following the Pfizer Transactioncompleted on 31 July 2019. The unutilised balances of the restructuring costs as at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 are included in Note 26 'Other provisions'. 2021 2020 2019 \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m Cost of sales 44 89 69 Selling, general and administration, and other operating expenses 150 314 236Research and development 1 8 25 195 411 330 13. Taxation The major components of income tax expense are: 2021 2020 2019 Taxation charge/(credit) based on profits for the period \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m Current year charge 361 540 196 Charge in respect of prior periods (50) 11 21 Total current taxation 311 551 217 Total deferred taxation (114) (141) (18) Total taxation charge 197 410 199 The tax charge on total profits amounted to \u00a3197 million (2020: \u00a3410 million and 2019: \u00a3199 million) and represented an rate of 12% (2020: 26% and 2019: 23%). 2021 2020 2019 Reconciliation of the taxation rate on the CH Group profits \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m Profit before tax 1,636 1,591 886 UK statutory rate of taxation of 19% 311 302 167Differences in overseas taxation rates 105 124 97Benefit of substance-based tax rulings (18) (70) (29)R&D tax credits (2) (2) (2)Tax losses not recognised 3 8 -Permanent differences on disposals, acquisitions and transfers (164) (20) -Items non-deductible/taxable for tax purposes 3 25 (1)Re-assessment of prior year estimates (70) 19 (29) Changes in tax rates 29 24 (4) Total tax charge 197 410 199 362 Permanent differences on disposals, acquisitions and transfers in 2021 reflects tax credits arising on the transfer of intellectual property within the CH Group. Future tax charges, and therefore the effective tax rate, may be affected by factors such as acquisitions, disposals, restructurings, the location of research and development activity, taxregime reforms, agreements with tax authorities and resolution of open matters as the CHGroup continue to bring the tax affairs up to date around the world. The CH Group operates incountries where the tax rate differs from the UK tax rate and the taxable profits earned and taxrates in those countries vary from year to year. The impact of these overseas taxes on theoverall rate of tax is shown above. Taxation mattersThe integrated nature of the CH Group's worldwide operations involves significant investment in research and manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-bordersupply routes into numerous end-markets. This gives rise to complexity and delay innegotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual CH Group companiesare liable to tax. In line with current OECD guidelines, the CH Group base its transfer pricing policy on the 'arm's length' principle. However, different tax authorities may seek to attribute further profit toactivities being undertaken in their jurisdiction potentially resulting in double taxation. The CHGroup also has open items in several jurisdictions concerning such matters as the deductibilityof particular expenses and the tax treatment of certain business transactions. The CH Groupapplies a risk based approach to determine the transactions most likely to be subject tochallenge and the probability that the CH Group would be able to obtain compensatoryadjustments under international tax treaties. The calculation of the CH Group's total tax charge therefore necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finallydetermined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate,through a formal legal process. Whilst a newly standalone CH Group may be subject to additional and/or different scrutiny from tax authorities than as part of a wider-GSK Group, the CH Group continues to believe that ithas made adequate provision for the liabilities it may bear in respect of periods which are openand not yet agreed by tax authorities. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from theamounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant taxauthorities or litigation where appropriate. At 31 December 2021, the CH Group hadrecognised provisions of \u00a3150 million in respect of such uncertain tax positions (2020:\u00a3124 million and 2019: \u00a3123 million). In 2021, the aggregate amount of unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately \u00a31.7 billion (2020: \u00a31.6 billion and 2019: \u00a31.4 billion). UK legislation relating tocompany distributions provides for exemption from tax for most repatriated profits, subject tocertain exceptions. Provision for deferred tax liabilities of \u00a338 million (2020: \u00a324 million and2019: \u00a314 million) has been made in respect of withholding taxation that would arise on thedistribution of profits by certain overseas subsidiaries. Deferred tax is not provided ontemporary differences of \u00a3147 million (2020: \u00a3135 million and 2019: nil) arising on unremittedprofits as management can control any future reversal and does not consider such a reversalto be probable. 363 Movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities Accelerated capital allowancesIntangiblesPensions & other post- (45) (3,451) 82 26 266 (3,122) Exchange adjustments (6) (18) (8) - 9 (23) (Charge)/credit to income statement(15) 31 (12) (17) 127 114 Credit to statement of comprehensive income- - (12) - (2) (14) At 31 December 2021 (66) (3,438) 50 9 400 (3,045) Accelerated capital allowancesIntangiblesPensions (35) (3,563) 64 17 257 (3,260) Exchange adjustments 1 11 1 1 - 14(Charge)/credit to income statement(11) 131 4 8 9 141 Credit to statement of comprehensive income- - 13 - - 13 Transfers from liabilities directly related to assetsheld for sale- (30) - - - (30) At 31 December 2020 (45) (3,451) 82 26 266 (3,122) Accelerated capital allowancesIntangiblesPensions & 2019 (39) (1,103) 61 14 165 (902) Exchange adjustments - 212 (3) (1) - 208(Charge)/credit to income statement(1) (51) (10) (7) 91 22 Credit to statement of comprehensive income-- 1 - 2 3 Additions through business combination5 (2,621) 15 11 (1) (2,591) At 31 December 2019 (35) (3,563) 64 17 257 364 Recognised million and 2019: \u00a317 million) in respect of net trading losses. Other net temporary differences include accrued expenses for which atax deduction is only available on a paid basis and deferred tax on intra-group profits arising onintercompany inventories which are eliminated within the consolidated Historical FinancialInformation. As intra-group profits are not eliminated from the individual entities' tax returns atemporary difference arises that will reverse at the point in time inventory is sold externally.After offsetting deferred tax assets and liabilities where appropriate within territories, the netdeferred tax liability comprises: 2021 2020 2019 \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m Deferred tax assets liabilities (3,357) (3,373) (3,514) (3,045) (3,122) (3,260) For the periods presented, US entities within the CH Group remain party to the GSK Group unitary state filing. US temporary differences therefore continue to be valued at the unitarystate tax blended rate applicable to the GSK Group. As a result of the demerger, the USentities will no longer be part of the GSK Group unitary state filing and these entities will needto prepare standalone state tax filings. This may result in a higher rate of state taxes applyingto the CH Group for both current and deferred tax liabilities. 2021 2021 2020 2020 10 years 15 3 26 3 6 1More than 10 years 326 15 335 17 349 24Available indefinitely 67 10 86 15 - - As at 31 December 408 28 447 35 355 25 Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise losses, as supported by management forecasts. 14.

The fair value less costs of disposal valuation methodology usessignificant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuationtechnique is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. These calculations determine thenet present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash flows of the relevant asset orcash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the CH Group's post-tax weighted averagecost of capital (\" WACC \") of 6%, adjusted where appropriate for relevant specific risks. For value in use calculations, where an impairment is indicated and a pre-tax cash flow calculationis expected to give a materially different result, the test would be re-performed using pre-taxcash flows and a pre-tax discount rate. Impairment losses of \u00a32 million for 2021 (2020: \u00a311 million and 2019: \u00a33 million) have been charged to cost of sales and \u00a315 million for 2021 (2020: \u00a38 million and 2019: \u00a33 million) havebeen charged to selling, general and administration expenses respectively. Reversals of impairment arise from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original impairments are deemed no longer to apply. All of thereversals have been credited to cost of sales. Reclassifications of \u00a38 million for 2020 (2019: \u00a34 million) relating to assets under construction that have been reclassified to computer software in intangible assets during the year.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs areassessed using a fair value less costs of disposal model. Fair value less costs of disposal iscalculated using a discounted cash flow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to theprojected risk-adjusted post-tax cash flows and terminal value. The discount rate used is based on the CH Group's post-tax WACC of 6%, as most cash generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the CH Group. The discountrate is adjusted where appropriate for specific segment, country or currency risks. Thevaluation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data,therefore this valuation technique is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Details relating to the discounted cash flow model used in the impairment tests of the Asia Pacific (\" APAC \"), Europe, Middle East and Africa and Latin America (\" EMEA andLatAm \"), and North America (\" N America \") cash generating units are as follows: Valuation basis Fair value less costs of disposal Key assumptions Sales growth rates Profit marginsTerminal growth rateDiscount rate Taxation rate Determination of assumptionsGrowth rates are internal forecasts based on both internal and external market information.Margins reflect past experience, adjusted for expectedchanges.Terminal growth rates based on management's estimate offuture long-term average growth rates.Discount rates based on the CH Group WACC, adjustedwhere appropriate. Taxation rates based on appropriate rates for each region. Period of specific projected cash flowsFive years Terminal growth rate 6.0% The terminal growth rate does not exceed the long-term projected growth rate for the CH Group, reflects the impact of future competition and takes account of new product launches. 371 Goodwill is monitored for impairment at the segmental level. In each case the valuation indicated sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions isunlikely to result in an impairment of goodwill. Indefinite life brands and other amortised brandsIndefinite life brands comprise a portfolio of Consumer Healthcare products primarily acquired from GlaxoSmithKline legacy entities, Novartis businesses acquired in 2015 and Pfizerbusinesses acquired in 2019.

The CH Group has performed a sensitivity analysisbased on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by managementleaving all other assumptions unchanged. Sensitivity analysis for the year ended 31 December2021 has identified these two brands as being sensitive to reasonably possible changes in keyassumptions. In order for the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying values ofRobitussin and Preparation H, either the discount rate would have to be increased by 0.5% and0.1%, or the operating margin decreased by 4.1% and 1.5%, or the long term growth ratedecreased by 0.7% and 0.2% respectively. Sensitivity analysis for the year ended31 December 2020 only identified Robitussin as being sensitive to reasonably possiblechanges in key assumptions. In order for the recoverable amount to be equal to the carryingvalue, the discount rate would have to be increased by 0.3% or operating margin decreased by2.7% or the long term growth rate decreased by 0.4%. The CH Group considers that changesin key assumptions of this magnitude are reasonably possible in the current environment. During the year ended 31 December 2020, Breathe Right and Physiogel were transferred to Assets Held for Sale and subsequently disposed of. In addition, certain brands includingLamisil, were reclassified from indefinite life brands to amortised brands following a review bythe CH Group on the useful life of these brands. As at 31 December 2021, Lamisil had acarrying value of \u00a3259 million and 2019: \u00a3291 million) with a remainingamortisation period of 18 years. 372 Except as set out above, each of these brands is considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of the brand and the level of marketing support. The brands are inrelatively similar, stable and profitable market sectors, with similar risk profiles, and their size,diversification and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing areduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low. The CH Group is notaware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factorwhich could limit their useful lives. Accordingly, they are not amortised. Each brand is tested annually for impairment and other amortised intangible assets are tested when indicators of impairment arise. This testing applies a fair value less costs of disposalmethodology, generally using post-tax cash flow forecasts with a terminal value calculation anda discount rate equal to the CH Group post-tax WACC of 6% for 2020 and 2019 adjustedwhere appropriate for country and currency specific risks. This valuation methodology usessignificant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuationtechnique is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The main assumptions includefuture sales price and volume growth, product contribution and the future expenditure requiredto maintain the product's marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdictions. Theseassumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of management'sbudgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosionthrough competition. The terminal growth rates applied of between -3% and 3% aremanagement's estimates of future long-term average growth rates of the relevant markets. Other than as disclosed above, the directors do not consider that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the fair value less cost of sale of the individuallysignificant brands disclosed above to fall below their carrying values. For 2021, the income statement charge for net impairment losses includes impairments of Zyrtec, Treely and capitalised costs for a discontinued research and development project,netted off by reversal of impairments in relation to Alvedon, Abreva and Solpadeine. Certain assets were transferred from intangible assets to assets held for sale and subsequently disposed of during the year. There were no assets and liabilities held of sale remaining as at31 December 2021. For 2020, the income statement charge for net impairment losses mainly includes impairments of Zyrtec, capitalised costs for a discontinued oral care project and a discontinued pain reliefdevice, netted off by reversal of impairments in relation to Transderm Scop. For 2019, the income statement charge for net impairment losses includes impairments of Savlon, Eurax and Abreva, netted off Prevacid.

The reversals of prior year write-downs of inventories in 2021 is \u00a363 million (2020: \u00a343 million and 2019: \u00a324 million) and principally arise from the reassessment of usage or demandexpectations prior to inventory expiration. Included in the balance as at 31 December 2019 is an uplift of the fair value of the inventory acquired from Pfizer as part of the Pfizer transaction of \u00a391 million. The uplift of the fair valuewas fully unwound as at 31 December 2020. For the year ended 31 December 2019, theamount of uplift of the fair value unwound was \u00a3366 million. 20.

There were no assets and liabilities held of sale remaining as at 31 December2021. Assets held for sale as at 31 December 2020, which were after impairment reversals and exchange impact, were subsequently disposed of in 2021. Assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in 2019 primarily reflect the Thermacare disposal group, which was acquired from Pfizer as part of its Consumer Healthcare businessbut had to be sold by the CH Group in 2020 to meet anti-trust requirements. Included within assets held for sale as at 31 December 2020 were inventory assets which were written down to fair value less costs to sell of \u00a36 million (2019: \u00a313 million).

As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reflectthe final outcome and are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the typesof buying group and product sales mix. The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterlyin the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returnsmade and any changes in arrangements. Future events could cause the assumptions on whichthe accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of the CH Group.

Pension benefits can be provided by state schemes, by defined contributionschemes, whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising fromcontributions paid in respect of each employee, or by defined benefit schemes, wherebyretirement benefits are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service. Pension costs of defined benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been calculated using the projected unit method. In certain countries pension benefits are provided on an unfundedbasis, some administered by trustee companies. Formal, independent, actuarial valuations ofthe CH Group's main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years. Actuarial movements in the period are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income. Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countrieswhere there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are used. 377 Discount rates are selected to reflect the term of the expected benefit payments. Projected inflation rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap betweenlong-term index-linked and fixed interest Gilts. In addition, GlaxoSmithKline plc affiliates operate certain pension schemes in which the CH Group's UK and US employees participate. These schemes include defined benefitarrangements where the assets are held independently of the CH Group's finances and whichare funded partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from theGlaxoSmithKline plc affiliates at rates advised by independent professionally qualifiedactuaries. For the UK plans, there is an interest rate and inflation hedging strategy in place. The targets are based on an economic measure of the plan liabilities. Furthermore, the plans also currentlyhedge a portion of their equity exposure with a staggered maturity profile. The interest rate riskand credit rate risk in the US plans are partially hedged. The targets are based on anaccounting measure of the plan liabilities. In the UK, the defined benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate. Theseschemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees, includingemployees of the CH Group, are entitled to join a defined contribution scheme. Following a period of consultation with impacted employees, it was announced on 17 December 2020 that the UK defined benefit plans would be closed to future accrualeffective from 31 March 2022. As a result, post closure the accrued benefits of activeparticipants will be revalued in line with inflation (RPI for the legacy Glaxo Wellcome plans andCPI for the legacy SmithKline Beecham plans subject to the relevant caps for eacharrangement) rather than capped pay increases. In addition, all defined benefit planparticipants who are still active at 1 April 2022, including participants of the CH Group, willreceive a defined pension contribution of \u00a310,000 each. With respect to the US cash balance pension plans, it was announced on 9 September 2020 that they would be closed to future accrual from 1 January 2021. In addition, there are a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the US. The management fee from GlaxoSmithKline plc group companies includes an element relating to the pension arrangements for the CH Group's UK and US employees calculated as if thearrangements were on a defined contribution basis. The underlying assets and liabilities of theschemes cover a number of UK and US undertakings and cannot readily be split between eachGroup undertaking on a consistent and reliable basis. The cost of such defined contributionarrangements is not included in the \u00a312 million (2020: \u00a317 million and 2019: \u00a324 million)charge analysed above. 378 The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in the years stated below for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: As at 31 December 2021Germany Switzerland Ireland Rest Male YearsFemale YearsFemale YearsMale YearsFemale Years Current 25.4 26.6 28.5 26.7 29.3 27.2 28.5 Projected for 2041 28.4 31.5 28.4 30.2 29.2 31.5 28.7 30.0 As at 31 December 2020Germany Switzerland Ireland Rest Male YearsFemale 28.2 Projected for 2040 28.4 31.5 28.4 30.4 29.0 31.3 28.4 29.7 As at 31 December 2019Germany Switzerland Ireland Rest of World Male YearsFemale YearsFemale 28.8 Projected 31.4 28.4 30.4 29.0 31.3 28.8 30.4 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specific assets or as a proportion of a general fund or are insurance contracts. Assets areinvested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.Investments are diversified to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment. The Pension Plans are exposed to risk that arises because the estimated market value of the Plans' assets might decline, the investment returns might reduce, or the estimated value of thePlans' liabilities might increase. In line with the agreed mix of return seeking assets to generate future returns and liability matching assets to better match future pension obligations, the CH Group has defined anoverall long-term investment strategy for the Plans, with investments across a broad range ofassets. The main market risks within the asset and hedging portfolio are against credit risk,interest rates, long-term inflation, equities, property, and bank counterparty risk. The Plan liabilities are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration. On an IAS 19 basis, these cash flows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term inflation rate andthe discount rate (AA corporate bond yield curve) where an increase in long-term inflationcorresponds with an increase in the liabilities, and an increase in the discount rate correspondswith a decrease in the liabilities. 379 The CH Group has applied the following financial assumptions in assessing the defined benefit liabilities: 2021 2020 2019 %p a %p a %p a Germany Rate of increase of future earnings 3.00 3.00 3.00Discount rate 1.10 0.50 1.10Expected pension increases 2.10 1.40 1.50 Inflation rate 2.10 1.40 1.50 Switzerland Rate of increase of future earnings 1.80 1.80 2.00Discount rate 0.20 0.10 0.10Expected pension increases -

Under local plan rules the new GSK Group Scheme covering theBiopharma businesses could not accept any retired members and therefore these memberswere included in the CH Group scheme. 383 A reconciliation of the net post-employment benefit to the balances recognised on the consolidated balance sheet is as follows: 2021 2020 2019 \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m Net Pensions total (142) (182) (178) Net post retirement obligations (100) (113) (117) Net post-employment benefit (242) (295) (295) Post-employment benefit assets recognised on the consolidated balance sheet11 41 3 Post-employment benefit obligations recognised on the consolidated balance sheet(253) (336) (298) Net post-employment benefit (242) (295) (295) Employer contributions for 2022 are estimated to be approximately \u00a328 million in respect of defined benefit pension schemes and \u00a36 million in respect of post-retirement medical benefits.

Contingent Liabilities 2021 2020 2019 \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m Contingent Liabilities 33 28 47 At 31 December 2021, contingent liabilities, comprising guarantees and other items arising in the normal course of business, amounted to \u00a333 million (2020: \u00a328 million and 2019: \u00a347million). Contingent liabilities arise when the CH Group has a present obligation as a result of apast event and comprise guarantees and other items arising in the normal course of business. Provision is made for the outcome of tax, legal and other disputes where it is both probable that the CH Group will suffer an outflow of funds and it is possible to make a reliable estimateof that outflow. The CH Group is involved in significant legal and administrative proceedings, principally product liability. The most significant of these matters, other than tax matters, are describedbelow. Legal proceedingsThe CH Group makes provision for these proceedings on a regular basis as summarised in Note 2 'Accounting principles and policies' and Note 26 'Other provisions'. The CH Group may become involved in significant legal proceedings in respect of which it is not possible to determine whether a potential outflow is probable. In these cases, appropriatedisclosures about such cases would be included in this note, but no provision would be madefor the cases. 386 With respect to each of the legal proceedings described below, other than those for which a provision has been made, the CH Group is unable to make a reliable estimate of the expectedfinancial effect at this stage. The CH Group does not believe that information about the amountsought by the plaintiffs, if that is known, would be meaningful with respect to those legalproceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the stage ofproceedings, the entitlement of parties to appeal a decision and clarity as to theories of liability,damages and governing law. The CH Group's position could change over time, and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed by amaterial amount the amount of the provisions reported in the CH Group's financial statements.If this were to happen, it could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations ofthe CH Group in the reporting period in which the judgements are incurred or the settlementsentered into. Zantac LitigationGSK Group and/or the Pfizer Group have been named as a defendant (alongside other manufacturers of ranitidine, as well as retailers and distributors) in approximately 2,150 USpersonal injury lawsuits involving Zantac, the bulk of which are pending in a MultidistrictLitigation (\" MDL \") in the Southern District of Florida. There are also numerous unfiled claims registered in a census required by the court presiding over the MDL. Class actions allegingeconomic injury and medical monitoring have also been filed in federal court. In addition to theproduct liability cases filed in the MDL, cases have been filed in several State Courts, includinga consolidated action in California State Court. Outside the USA, there are four class actionspending against the GSK Group and the Pfizer Group in Canada, along with a class actionpending against the GSK Group in Israel. The GSK Group has also received notice of a civilinvestigation opened by the Department of Justice (the \" DOJ \") into allegation of False Claims Act violations by the GSK Group related to Zantac. The New Mexico Attorney General filed alawsuit against multiple defendants, including the GSK Group and the Pfizer Group, allegingviolations of state consumer protection and false advertising statutes, among other claims. Under the Pfizer SAPA, the CH Group is required to indemnify the GSK Group and the Pfizer Group in respect of \"Purchaser Liabilities\" and \"Assumed Liabilities\", which may includeliabilities related to OTC Zantac. Whilst Pfizer and GSK have each served the CH Group withnotice of potential claims under the relevant indemnification provisions in the Pfizer SAPA inrelation to possible liabilities connected with OTC Zantac, it is not possible, at this stage, tomeaningfully assess whether the outcome will result in a probable outflow, or to quantify orreliably estimate the liability (if any) that the CH Group may have to the GSK Group and/or thePfizer Group under the relevant indemnities. Proton Pump Inhibitor litigationThe CH Group is a defendant in the ongoing proton pump inhibitor (\" PPI\") litigation, in which plaintiffs allege that their use of PPIs caused serious bodily injuries, including acute kidneyinjury, chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure. As of June 2021, there areapproximately 1,500 Prevacid24HR personal injury lawsuits and approximately 2,300Nexium24HR cases pending against the CH Group, nearly all of which are pending in aMultidistrict Litigation (\" MDL \") proceeding in the District of New Jersey. Manufacturers of other PPIs, including both prescription and OTC products, also are named as co-defendants in theMDL. The CH Group has filed motions to dismiss several hundred cases, but the MDL courthas not yet ruled on those motions. In addition to the MDL cases, a small number of cases arepending in state courts. The CH Group is unable to determine whether the outcome will resultin a probable outflow. German Competition LitigationIn 2013, the CH Group and other members of a working group, K\u00f6rperpflege, Wasch- und Reinigungsmittel (\" KWR \"), of a German trademark association were fined by the Federal Cartel 387 Office of Germany, as a result of the exchange of certain information during meetings from 2004 to 2006. The information exchanged related primarily to annual terms negotiations withretailers and to the timing and the order of magnitude of list price increases. Following the fineimposed by the Federal Cartel Office in 2013, the CH Group is party to eight active civilproceedings in Germany for damages against the CH Group and other manufacturers ofbranded drugstore products. The claimants allege that the exchange of information within KWRled to higher purchase prices being paid by the retailers, and therefore the Group and otherKWR members are jointly and severally liable for potential damages. The proceedings aretaking place in different courts across Germany and are at different stages. Separate proceedings have been brought against the CH Group and certain other members of KWR by the insolvency administrator of Schlecker (formerly a large drugstore retailer inGermany) and other retailers. Two of these actions have been dismissed in lower courts butare subject to appeal. Additionally, the CH Group has intervened as a third party on thedefendants' side in three other separate proceedings. The CH Group is unable to determinewhether the outcome will result in a probable outflow. 28.

Share premium was recognised on shares issued by CHHL2 except where CHHL2 has applied to take merger relief underSection 612 of the Companies Act 2006. In such cases the excess of the fair value of theassets and liabilities recognised into the CH Group, over the nominal value of the share issuedhas been added to the merger reserve as per table disclosed below. During the year ended 31 December 2019, CHHL2 allotted 680,000 ordinary A shares of \u00a31 each to GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings Limited and 320,000 ordinary Bshares of \u00a31 each to PF Consumer Healthcare Holdings LLC. All these shares were allottedwith \u00a31 million nominal value and \u00a320,842 million share premium. In addition, CHHL2 also issued 300,000 preference shares of \u00a31 each to GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings Limited during the year. The preference shares arenon-redeemable with a discretionary right to receive conditional dividends in which 0.01% ofthe aggregate amount of dividend shall be payable to the holders of the preference shares,therefore the preference shares are classified as equity. During the year ended 31 December 2020, CHHL2 issued one C Deferred share of \u00a313,166,038,547 to GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings Limited. The C Deferredshare is non-redeemable and does not carry any voting rights, dividend rights or rights in theevent of a return of capital. Subsequently during 2020, CHHL2 cancelled and extinguished in its entirety the share premium balance of \u00a320,842 million in accordance with section 642 of the Companies Act.CHHL2 also cancelled and extinguished the fully paid up C Deferred share of \u00a313,166 million inthe share capital of CHHL2 held by GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Holdings Limited.Details of other reserves are included below: 2021 2020 2019 Other reserves \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m As at 1 January (11,652) 1,372 (14,841) Other comprehensive income 9 - - Issue of share capital - (13,166) 16,213Capital reduction - (45) -Contribution from parent 11 - - Contribution (non-cash) from parent - 187 - As at 31 December (11,632) (11,652) 1,372 Other Reserves include a merger reserve that arises as a result of acquisition of business. 389 29. Acquisitions and disposals 2020Business acquisitionsOn 28 September 2020, the CH Group completed the acquisition of legal ownership of approximately 55% equity interests in the legal entity that holds the Hsinchu site in Taiwanfrom the Pfizer Group in a non-cash transaction, whereby the CH Group has acquired thebusiness as part of the completion of the Pfizer Transaction on 31 July 2019. The CH Grouphas measured the business at fair value. Goodwill of \u00a3124m, which is not expected to be deductible for tax purpose, has been recognised. The goodwill represents the potential for future synergies arising from combiningthe acquired businesses with the CH Group's existing business together with the value of theworkforce acquired. The non-controlling interest for this acquisition recorded in the CH Group, calculated applying the proportionate interests' method, represents Pfizer Group's share of the net assets of theCH Group, excluding goodwill. The majority of the Hsinchu site's revenue was generated through manufacturing of Consumer Healthcare products for companies within the CH Group and was eliminated on consolidation.Therefore, the external revenue arising from the Hsinchu site since the acquisition on28 September 2020 was immaterial and would remain immaterial if the business had beenacquired at the beginning of the year. The business has been integrated into the CH Group'sexisting activities and it is not practicable to identify the impact on the CH Group profit in theperiod. The fair value of the assets acquired in business combinations, including goodwill, are set out in the table below. Taiwan Hsinchu site business \u00a3m Net assets acquired: Intangible assets 2 Property, plant and equipment 6 Inventory 5 Cash and cash equivalents 20 Other assets 6 Other liabilities (21) Non-controlling interests (14) Goodwill 124 Total 128 Consideration settled by shares in CHHL2 128 Cash consideration paid - Total consideration 128 2020 Business disposalsIn 2020, the CH Group made several business disposals, resulting in the CH Group receiving net cash consideration of \u00a3221 million. The business disposals mainly related to the divestmentof EMEA rights of Thermacare, which was acquired from Pfizer as part of its ConsumerHealthcare business following the completion of the Pfizer Transaction on 31 July 2019 andwas disposed by the CH Group on 30 March 2020 to meet anti-trust requirements. 390 The gain on the disposals of businesses in the year of \u00a369 million was calculated as follows: Total \u00a3m Cash consideration received 221 Net assets sold:Goodwill (1) Intangible assets (125) Property, plant and equipment (12)Inventory (5) Other net assets (1) (144) Transaction costs (8) Total gain on disposal 69 2019 Business acquisitionsThe Pfizer Transaction was completed on 31 July 2019.The GSK Group and Pfizer have contributed their respective Consumer Healthcare businesses into the CH Group to form a new Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture in a non-cashtransaction, whereby the CH Group has acquired Pfizer's Consumer Healthcare business inreturn for shares in the CH Group. CHHL2 is the parent holding company of the new JointVenture and the CH Group is being held by the GSK Group with an equity interest of 68% andPfizer with an equity interest of 32%. Goodwill of \u00a35.6 billion, which is not expected to be deductible for tax purpose, has been recognised. The goodwill represents the potential for future synergies arising from combiningthe acquired businesses with the CH Group's existing business together with the value of theworkforce acquired. Total transaction costs for the acquisition amounted to \u00a377 million. Since the acquisition on 31 July 2019, revenue of \u00a31.2 billion arising from the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare business has been included in CH Group revenue in 2019. If the business hadbeen acquired at the beginning of the year, CH Group revenue in 2019 would have been\u00a31.5 billion higher. The business has been integrated into the CH Group's existing activitiesand it is not practical to identify the impact on the CH Group profit in the period. 391 The fair value of the assets acquired in business combinations, including goodwill, are set out in the table below.

Related party transactions The CH Group undertook significant transactions with entities from within the GSK Group during the years ended 31 December 2021, 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 andwith entities from within the Pfizer Group for the period from 1 August 2019 to 31 December2019 and for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2021. Entities from within the GSK Group supplied goods to and purchased goods from the CH Group during the period. The CH Group supplies goods to companies within the GSK Groupunder Distribution Agreements in those countries where the CH Group does not have its ownlocal operating company. In addition, entities from within the GSK Group were engaged toprovide support function services to the CH Group under Support Services Agreements(\"SSA \") including: regulatory and safety services, financial management and reporting, human resources, payroll services, IT support, property management, legal services, contractmanufacturing, management of the CH Group's UK and US pension schemes, andmanagement of the CH Group's employee share schemes. In addition, the CH Group operatesseparate agreements with GSK affiliates for the provision of research and development and fortoll-manufacturing services. Cash amounts are also held with GSK financing companies.Entities from within the Pfizer Group supplied services and goods to and purchased goods andservices from the CH Group via the Transitional Services Agreement during the period. Allrelated party transactions are undertaken at arm's length in accordance with the CH Grouptransfer pricing policy. Where the legal completion of local transfer of assets and liabilities has been delayed, but the CH Group is able to exercise control over the relevant activities, the relevant net assets andprofits have been recognised in the results. Comparative disclosures included related party transactions with entities within the Pfizer Group for the period from 1 August 2019 to 31 December 2019. Following the completion of 392 the Pfizer Transaction on 31 July 2019, transactions between the CH Group and Pfizer Group are deemed related party transactions and are disclosed below for the period from 1 August2019 onwards.

Financial instruments and related disclosures The CH Group reports in Sterling and paid dividends out of cash in Sterling. During the periods presented, GSK Group's Treasury function has been employed as a service provider tomanage and monitor the CH Group's external and internal funding requirements and financialrisks in support of the CH Group's strategic objectives. Treasury activities are governed bypolicies approved by the CH Group Board of Directors. The CH Group operates on a global basis, through a number of subsidiary companies and the existing sales networks of the GSK Group. A Treasury meeting, chaired by the GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Chief Financial Officer (CFO), takes place on a regular basis to review Treasury activities. Its members receivemanagement information relating to Treasury activities. The GSK Group's internal auditorsreview the Treasury internal control environment regularly as part of their review of the GSKGroup's Treasury function. 394 The CH Group may use a variety of financial instruments to finance its operations and derivative financial instruments to manage market risks from these operations. Derivativesprincipally comprise of foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps which are used to swapborrowings and liquid assets into currencies required for group purposes. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes in relation to underlying business activities and not as trading or speculative instruments. Capital managementDuring the periods presented, the CH Group managed its capital to ensure that entities in the CH Group were able to operate as going concerns whilst availing themselves of intercompanyfunding where appropriate. The capital structure of the CH Group consists wholly ofshareholders' equity as well as short-term bank loans (see \"consolidated statement of changesin equity\" and Note 24 'Borrowings'). The Board reviews the CH Group's dividend policy whichis established in accordance with parameters set in the Shareholders Agreement between theGSK Group and the Pfizer Group. Selling margins are sufficient to cover normal operating costs and operations are cash generative. Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in research and development of new products. It is also used to make routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax and dividends. Liquidity riskThe CH Group benefits from strong positive cash flow from its operating units and has substantial cash and cash equivalents, which amounted to \u00a3413 million at 31 December 2021(2020: \u00a3333 million and 2019: \u00a3339 million). Market riskInterest rate risk managementThe CH Group has no significant external debt and therefore its interest expense is not exposed to changes in interest rates. The CH Group earns interest income on its cash andtherefore benefits from an increase in interest rates. The impact of a decrease in interest ratesis limited (see interest rate sensitivity). Forward starting interest rate swapsThe forward starting interest rate contracts, exchanging floating interest for fixed interest, have been designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the interest variability of the interest cash flowsassociated with the future fixed rate debt. The critical terms of the forward starting interest rate swap contracts and their corresponding hedged items are materially the same. A qualitative assessment of effectiveness is performed,and it is expected that the value of the interest rate swap contracts and the value of thecorresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite directions in response tomovements in the underlying interest rates. The main sources of ineffectiveness in thesehedge relationships are the effects of the Group's own credit risk on the fair value of theinterest rate swap contracts, which are not reflected in the fair value of the hedged itemattributable to the change in interest rates. No other material sources of ineffectivenessemerged from these hedging relationships. 395 The following tables provide information regarding forward starting interest rate swap contracts outstanding and the related hedged items at 31 December 2021. Interest rate swap contractassets and liabilities are presented in the line 'Derivative financial instruments' (either as assetsor liabilities) on the Consolidated balance sheet. 2021 Hedging instrumentsAverage contracted fixed rateNotional principal valueChange in fair value for recognising hedge ineffectivenessFair assets/ %\u00a3 m \u00a3 years 668 4 10-30 years 1.3385% 935 3 3>30 years 1.4515% 393 4 4 2021 Hedged items Change in value used for calculating hedge ineffectivenessBalance in cash flow hedge reserve for continuing hedges \u00a3m \u00a3m Pre-hedging of long-term interest rate(11) (9) The following table details the effectiveness of the hedging relationships and the amounts reclassified from the hedging reserve to profit or loss: 2021 Amount reclassified to profit or loss Hedging gains/(losses) recognised in other comprehensive incomeAmount of hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or lossLine item in profit or loss in which hedge ineffectiveness is includedHedged future cash flows no longer expected to occurAs hedged item affects profit or lossLine item in which reclassification adjustment is included \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m Cash flow hedges Pre-hedging years 4 expense Interest rate benchmark reform 'Interest rate benchmark reform - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 4, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16' Phase I and Phase II were issued by the IASB in September 2019 and August 2020.These amendments modify specific hedge accounting requirements to allow hedge accountingto continue for affected hedges during the period of uncertainty before the hedged items orhedging instruments affected by the current interest rate benchmarks are amended as a resultof the ongoing interest rate benchmark reforms. Phase II also provides that, for financialinstruments measured using amortised cost measurement, changes to the basis fordetermining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform should bereflected by adjusting their effective interest rate and no immediate gain or loss should berecognised. 396 The CH Group has closely monitored the market and the output from the various industry working groups managing the transition to new benchmark interest rates. This includesannouncements made by LIBOR regulators, including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, regarding the transition away fromLIBOR (including GBP LIBOR, USD LIBOR and EURIBOR) to the Sterling Overnight IndexAverage Rate (SONIA), the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), and the Euro Short-Term Rate ( \u20acSTR) respectively. At 31 December 2021, the CH Group was not directly exposed to interest rate benchmark reform as it held no interest rate derivatives or floating rate debt that referenced to LIBOR. TheCH Group did not transition any material derivatives or floating rate debt into a new index as allof the instruments referencing LIBOR matured before December 2021 and new derivativeinstruments are referenced to SOFR. Foreign exchange risk managementForeign currency transaction exposures arising on internal and external trade flows are selectively hedged. The CH Group's objective is to minimise the exposure of overseasoperating subsidiaries to transaction risk by matching local currency income with local currencycosts where possible and by maintaining intercompany payment terms of 30 days or less.Foreign currency cash flows may be hedged selectively as approved by the CFO. Cashsurpluses or borrowing requirements of subsidiary companies are usually managed centrallyusing foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps to hedge future repayments back into theoriginating currency. 397 Derivative financial instruments and hedging program Derivative financial instruments are used to mitigate exposure to foreign exchange transactional risks of the CH Group and are classified as a current asset or liability. The fairvalue of a derivative financial instrument is classified as a non-current asset or liability if theremaining maturity is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability if the maturity isless than 12 months. All foreign exchange contracts are for periods of 12 months or less. 2021 2020 2019 Fair value Fair value Fair value Assets \u00a3mLiabilities \u00a3mAssets \u00a3mLiabilities \u00a3mAssets \u00a3mLiabilities \u00a3m Non-current Cash swap contracts (principalamount - \u00a31,996 million(2020 - \u00a3nil, 2019 - \u00a3nil)12 (1) - - - - Current Cash flow hedges - Interest rate swap contracts (principalamount - \u00a3nil million (2020 -\u00a3nil, 2019 - \u00a3nil)- - -- -- Derivatives designated and effective as hedginginstruments12 (1) - - - - Non-current Embedded and other derivatives- - -- -- Current Foreign exchange contracts (principal amount -\u00a31,854 million (2020 -\u00a32,318 million, 2019 -\u00a31,668 million)5 (18) 6 (25) 12 (2) Embedded and other derivatives- - -- -- Derivatives classified as held for trading5 (18) 6 (25) 12 (2) Total derivative instruments 17 (19) 6 (25) 12 (2) Wholesale and retail credit risk The CH Group employs the GSK Group as a service provider to monitor credit risk relating to key wholesalers. These activities include a review of their quarterly financial information andStandard & Poor's credit ratings, development of internal risk ratings, and the establishmentand periodic review of credit limits. The results of these reviews are submitted toGlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare's local management to support the risk managementprocess. No customer accounts for more than 5% of the CH Group's trade receivablesbalance. All new customers are subject to a credit vetting process and existing customers will be subject to a review at least annually. The vetting process and subsequent reviews involve obtaininginformation including the customer's status as a government or private sector entity, auditedfinancial statements, credit bureau reports, debt rating agency (e.g. Moody's, Standard &Poor's) reports, payment performance history (from trade references, industry credit groups)and bank references. Historical and forward-looking information is considered to determine the appropriate expected credit loss allowance. 398 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group and arises on cash and cash equivalents and favourable derivativefinancial instruments held with banks and financial institutions as well as credit exposures towholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables. The CH Group considers its maximum credit risk to be \u00a33,894 million (2020: \u00a33,588 million and 2019: \u00a34,100 million) which is the total of the CH Group's financial assets, excluding Otherinvestments which bear equity risk rather than credit risk. See next page for details on theCH Group's total financial assets. The CH Group's greatest concentration of credit risk at 31 December 2021 is \u00a3456 million (2020: \u00a3412 million million) with GSK IHC Ltd (A+/A2). As at 31 December 2020, there was also credit risk of \u00a3313 million (2019: \u00a3nil) with GlaxoSmithKline (China) R&D Company Limited (A/A2). As at 31 December 2019, theCH Group was also exposed to concentration risk of \u00a3222 million with GSK Finance plc. Therehas been no change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during thecurrent reporting period in assessing the loss allowance for financial assets at amortised costsince the adoption of IFRS 9. Treasury-related credit riskThe CH Group has continued to maintain its conservative approach to counterparty risk throughout 2021. The aggregate credit risk in respect of financial instruments that theCH Group may have with one counterparty is limited by reference to the long-term creditratings assigned for that counterparty by Moody's Investors Service (\" Moody's \") and Standard and Poor's. The table below sets out the credit ratings of counterparties for cash and cashequivalents. 2021 \u00a3m \u00a3m Bank balances and deposits - - 393 14 3 410 Money Market Funds 3 - - - - 3 Government securities - 1 - - - 1 Third party financial derivatives - - 17 - - 17 3 1 410 14 3 431 2020 AAA/Aaa AA/Aa \u00a3m Bank balances and deposits - - 289 36 8 333 Third party financial derivatives - -6 - - 6 - - 295 36 8 339 2019 AAA/Aaa AA/Aa A/A \u00a3m \u00a3m Bank balances and deposits - 27 279 27 6 339 Third party financial derivatives - 12 - - - 12 - 39 279 27 6 351 399 The credit ratings in the above tables are as assigned by Moody's and Standard and Poor's. Where the opinion of the two rating agencies differs, the lower rating of the two is assigned tothe counterparty. Where local rating or Fitch data is the only source available, the ratings areconverted to global ratings equivalent to those of Standard and Poor's or Moody's usingpublished conversion tables. The cash balances are used by subsidiary entities in funding their working capital requirements. The \u00a33 million (2020: \u00a38 million and 2019: \u00a3nil and 2019: \u00a3nil) held with Banco Popular (unrated) in Puerto Rico. Global counterparty limits are assigned to each of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare's banking and investment counterparties based on long-term credit ratings from Moody's andStandard and Poor's. The CH Group's usage of these limits is monitored daily by GSK Group'sCorporate Compliance Officer (\" CCO \") who operates independently from GSK Group's Treasury. Any breach of these limits would be reported to the CFO immediately. The CCO alsomonitors the credit rating of these counterparties and, when changes in ratings occur, notifiesGSK Group's Treasury so that changes can be made to investment levels or authority limits asappropriate.

The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at theprice that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderlytransaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: \u0081 Cash and cash equivalents - approximates to the carrying amount\u0081 Short-term loans and overdrafts - approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments \u0081 Forward exchange contracts - based on present value of contractual cash flows using market sourced data (exchange rates) \u0081 Receivables and payables - approximates to the carrying amount Trade and other receivables, Other non-current assets, Trade and other payables, Other provisions and Other non-current liabilities are reconciled to the relevant balance sheetamounts in tables below. Financial instruments held at fair valueFinancial assets and liabilities held at fair value are categorised by the valuation methodology applied in determining their fair value. Where possible, quoted prices in active markets are 401 used (Level 1). Where such prices are not available, the asset is classified as Level 2, provided all significant inputs to the valuation model used are based on observable market data. If oneor more of the significant inputs to the valuation model is not based on observable market data,the instrument is classified as Level 3.

As there is presentlynot a legally enforceable right of offset, these amounts have not been offset in the balancesheet but have been presented separately in the tables above. Sensitivity analysisThe sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the amount of net cash (cash and cash equivalents less overdrafts), the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of thedebt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currenciesare all constant. Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, cash anddeposits and derivative financial instruments. The tables below illustrate the estimated impacton the income statement and equity as a result of hypothetical market movements in foreignexchange and interest rates in relation to the CH Group's financial instruments. The range ofvariables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects management's view of changes which arereasonably possible over a one-year period. 405 Foreign exchange sensitivity The two major foreign currencies in which the CH Group's financial instruments are denominated are US Dollars and Euros. The CH Group has considered movements in thesecurrencies over the last three years and has concluded that a 10-cent movement in rates is areasonable benchmark. Financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreignexchange rates where they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.Intercompany loans which are fully hedged to maturity with a currency swap have beenexcluded from this analysis. 2021 2020 2019 Increase/ (decrease) in income(Decrease)/ increase in income(Decrease)/ increase in income \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m 10 cent appreciation of the US dollar 2 (14) (1) 10 cent depreciation of the US dollar (2) 12 110 cent appreciation of the Euro dollar (5) (7) (5)10 cent depreciation of the Euro dollar 4 6 4 Interest rate sensitivity The CH Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments where any changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of financialinstruments. The table below shows the CH Group's hypothetical sensitivity to changes in interest rates in relation to Sterling, US dollar, Euro and Swiss franc variable rate financial assets and liabilities,including derivatives.

Presentation of the Historical Financial Information1.1 General Information Pfizer Consumer Healthcare (\" PCH \" or the \" Business \") was a business unit of Pfizer Inc. (\"Pfizer \") during the seven-month period ended 31 July 2019. PCH develops, manufactures and markets leading non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and personal care products. Thecombined Historical Financial Information includes all the operations that comprise the PfizerConsumer Healthcare operations of Pfizer. On 31 July 2019, Pfizer completed a transaction in which Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline plc (\"GSK \") combined their respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. Inexchange for contributing PCH to the joint venture, Pfizer received a 32% equity stake in thenew company and GSK owns the remaining 68%. The combined Historical Financial Information of PCH, as described further below, for the seven months ended 31 July 2019 (the \" Historical Financial Information \") has been prepared specifically for the purposes of this Prospectus and in accordance with Regulation(EU) 2017/1129 as supplemented by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980 eachas they form part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the EU Withdrawal Act(2018) and in accordance with the basis of preparation set out below. This Historical Financial Information does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434(3) of the Companies Act 2006. 1.2 Perimeter and basis of preparation As the Business has not historically constituted a separate legal entity or group, the Historical Financial Information, which has been presented for the purpose of this document has beenprepared on a basis that combines the results, assets and liabilities of the Business byapplying principles of consolidation as set out in IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements'. The Historical Financial Information has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules and in accordance with this basis of preparation. This basis of preparationdescribes how the Historical Financial Information has been prepared in accordance withInternational Financial Reporting Standards as adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union ('IFRS') for the seven months ended 31 July2019 except as noted below. The principal accounting policies that have been applied inpreparing the Historical Financial Information are set out below. The Historical FinancialInformation has been prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies adopted inthe Consolidated Historical Financial Information of GSK Consumer Healthcare. IFRS does not explicitly provide guidance for the preparation of combined Historical Financial Information, therefore certain accounting conventions permitted for the preparation of HistoricalFinancial Information for inclusion in investment circulars, as described in the Standards forInvestment Reporting 2000 Annexure (the 'Annexure'), issued by the UK Audit PracticesBoard, have been applied where IFRS does not provide specific accounting treatments. The Historical Financial Information is presented in Sterling (\u00a3). For most of PCH's international operations, the local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. Allvalues are in millions of GBP (''\u00a3m''), except where otherwise indicated. 433 All significant intercompany balances and transactions between the legal entities that comprise PCH have been eliminated. Balances due from or due to Pfizer that are expected to be cash-settled, if any, are included, depending on the nature of the balance, in Trade and otherreceivables, Other non-current assets, Trade and other payables and Other non-currentliabilities in the combined balance sheet. All balances and transactions among PCH and Pfizerthat are not cash-settled are shown as part of equity in the combined balance sheet andrepresent the net of amounts settled without payment (to)/from Pfizer. For additionalinformation about balances and transactions among PCH and Pfizer, see Note 24. The Historical Financial Information has been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Pfizer and include allocations for direct costs andindirect costs attributable to the operations of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer. Income statement \u0081 The combined income statement reflects all of the operating results of PCH that were either specifically identifiable or directly attributable to PCH and its operationsassociated with the product lines based on how the PCH business was managed aspart of Pfizer in the period presented, except for certain products (primarily aprescription medicine that transferred to a non-prescription product) that were not partof the transaction with GSK and remained with Pfizer. \u0081 The combined income statement includes costs directly incurred by PCH for certain support functions (Enabling Functions) and allocations to PCH for Enabling Functionsthat were provided on a centralised basis within Pfizer, such as expenses for digital,facilities, legal, finance, human resources, insurance, public affairs and procurement,among others. Allocations are based on either a specific identification basis or, whenspecific identification is not practical, proportional allocation methods (e.g., using third-party sales, headcount, etc.), depending on the nature of the services. \u0081 The combined income statement includes certain manufacturing and supply costs directly incurred by PCH for manufacturing facilities, external supply, and logistics andsupport as well as allocations of such costs incurred by manufacturing plants that wereshared with other Pfizer business units and centralised Pfizer Global Supply (PGS)costs that Pfizer did not routinely allocate to its business units. These costs mayinclude manufacturing variances and changes in the standard costs of inventory,among others. Where used, allocations are based on either a specific identificationbasis or, when specific identification is not practical, proportional allocation methods,such as consumer healthcare identified manufacturing costs, depending on the natureof the costs. \u0081 The combined income statement includes directly incurred costs for certain PCH research and development (R&D) activities and allocations of certain R&D expensesmanaged by Pfizer's R&D organisation. Pfizer does not routinely allocate these coststo any of its business units. These allocations are based on either a specificidentification basis or, when specific identification is not practical, estimates of thecosts incurred in connection with the R&D activities associated with PCH. \u0081 The combined income statement also includes allocations from Enabling Functions and PGS for restructuring charges, additional depreciation associated with assetrestructuring and implementation costs. Pfizer does not routinely allocate these coststo any of its business units. For additional information about allocations of restructuringcharges and other costs associated with cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, seeNote 10. \u0081 The combined income statement includes allocations of pension and post-retirement service costs that have been deemed attributable to PCH operations. For informationabout allocations of pension and post-retirement costs, see Note 20. 434 \u0081 The combined income statement includes allocations of other corporate and commercial costs, which can include, but are not limited to, certain compensationitems, such as share-based compensation expenses and certain fringe benefitexpenses maintained on a centralised basis within Pfizer. Pfizer does not routinelyallocate these costs to any of its business units. The combined income statement alsoincludes a combination of allocations to PCH and directly incurred costs for othercorporate and commercial costs for certain strategy, business development, and otherrelated activities. Allocations are based on either a specific identification basis or, whenspecific identification is not practical, proportional allocation methods (e.g., using third-party sales, headcount, etc.), depending on the nature of the services. \u0081 The combined income statement includes an allocation of income from insurance recoveries related to the hurricanes in Puerto Rico toward the end of the third quarterof 2017. \u0081 The combined income statement includes the impact of certain specifically identified assets as well as allocations of purchase accounting impacts resulting from businesscombinations and trade and asset acquisitions. These impacts are primarily associatedwith PCH related assets acquired as part of Pfizer's acquisitions of Wyeth (2009),Ferrosan's consumer healthcare business (2011), Alacer Corporation (2012) andTreerly Healthcare Co. Ltd (2016), and primarily include amortisation related to theincrease in fair value of the acquired definite life intangible assets, depreciation relatedto the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets (primarilymanufacturing facilities), and the fair value changes associated with contingentconsideration. \u0081 The combined income statement includes an allocation of interest-related expenses, including the effect of hedging activities associated with the Pfizer corporate debt, andan allocation for interest income associated with the Pfizer corporate investments,primarily based on proportional earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation andamortisation. PCH participated in Pfizer's centralised hedging and offsetting programs.As such, the combined income statement, includes an allocation for the impact ofPfizer's derivative financial instruments used for offsetting changes in foreign currencyrates net of the related exchange gains and losses for the portion that was deemed tobe associated with PCH operations primarily based on proportional earnings beforeinterest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. Balance sheet \u0081 The combined balance sheet reflects all of the assets and liabilities of Pfizer that were either specifically identifiable or were directly attributable to PCH and its operations.Cash from PCH operations in subsidiaries that were not completely PCH dedicated isnot included in the combined balance sheet since this cash is swept into Pfizer'scentralised cash management system. PCH participated in Pfizer's centralised cashmanagement system and generally all excess cash was transferred to Pfizer on a dailybasis. Cash disbursements for operations and/or investing activities were funded asneeded by Pfizer. Accordingly, the PCH cash balance as of 31 July 2019 is notrepresentative of an independent company and could be significantly different atanother point in time. \u0081 For benefit plans, the combined balance sheet only includes the assets and liabilities of benefit plans dedicated to PCH employees-see Note 20. \u0081 The combined Historical Financial Information do not include allocations of Pfizer corporate debt as none is specifically related to the PCH operations. Management believes that the allocations are a reasonable reflection of the services received or the costs incurred on behalf of PCH and its operations and that the combined incomestatement reflects all costs of the PCH Business. 435 The provision for taxes on income in the combined income statement has been calculated as if PCH filed a tax return separate from Pfizer in the various jurisdictions where it does business. The allocated expenses from Pfizer primarily include: Cost of salesSelling, general and administrative expensesResearch and development \u00a3m Enabling functions operating expenses1 100 5 - - 106 PGS manufacturing costs 4 - 1 - - 5 Research and developmentexpenses-- 6 - - 6 Restructuring charges 1 5 - - - 6 Additional depreciation associatedwith asset restructuring1- - - - 1 Implementation costs 2 1 1 - - 4 Fringe benefit expenses - 1 - - - 1 Share-based compensationexpense31 3 4 - - 20 Net interest expense - - - - 18 18 Income from insurance recoveries - (11) - - - (11) Net gains associated with Pfizer'sinvestments and net currencyexchange gains- - - (1) (3) (4) Other corporate and commercial costs23 1 - - 6 2. Accounting principles and policies (a) ConsolidationEntities over which PCH has the power to direct the relevant activities so as to affect the returns to PCH, generally through control over the financial and operating policies from eithervoting or contractual rights, are accounted for as subsidiaries. Interests acquired in entities areconsolidated from the date PCH acquires control and interests sold are de-consolidated fromthe date control ceases. Where, as part of a business combination, PCH is not able to exercise control over a particular operation due to the existence of legal or other restrictions, the associated assets and liabilitiesare not consolidated, and a financial asset or liability is recognised for the economic benefit orobligation to be received under the contribution agreement. The assets and liabilities areconsolidated, and the associated financial asset or liability derecognised, on the date at whichPCH is able to exercise control over these operations. Transactions and balances between subsidiaries are eliminated and no profit before tax is recognised on sales between subsidiaries until the products are sold to customers outside ofPCH. Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity. The financial information included in the combined Historical Financial Information is as of 31 July 2019 and for the seven months from 1 January 2019 to 31 July 2019 for the USsubsidiaries and as of 30 June 2019 and for the seven months from 1 December 2018 to30 June 2019 for subsidiaries operating outside the US. PCH is not able to combine its US andInternational subsidiaries on the same reporting date as it is impracticable to do so. TheHistorical Financial Information is adjusted for the effects of significant transactions or eventsthat occur between these dates, where applicable. No such adjustments were necessary in theperiod presented in these combined financial statements. 436 (b) Business combinations Business combinations where common control exists at the time of the transaction relate to businesses that were controlled by a part of Pfizer, other than PCH and then as a result of thecombination were transferred into PCH at some point during the period covered by theHistorical Financial Information. Such business combinations are accounted for by recognisingall the assets and liabilities acquired at their previous carrying values within Pfizer with effectfrom the beginning of the earliest period reported in the Historical Financial Information. Nonew goodwill arises from such transactions. Business combinations where common control does not exist before the transaction are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method. Identifiable assets, liabilities andcontingent liabilities acquired are measured at fair value at acquisition date. The considerationtransferred is measured at fair value and includes the fair value of any contingentconsideration. Where the consideration transferred, together with the non-controlling interest,exceeds the fair value of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the excessis recorded as goodwill, denominated in the currency of the operation acquired. The costs related to business combinations are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Where not all the equity of a subsidiary is acquired thenon-controlling interest is recognised either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest'sshare of the net assets of the subsidiary, on a case-by-case basis. Changes in PCH's ownership percentage of subsidiaries are accounted for within equity.(c) Foreign currency translationForeign currency transactions are booked in the functional currency of the relevant company at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets andliabilities are retranslated into the functional currency at rates of exchange ruling at the balancesheet date. Exchange differences are included in the income statement. On consolidation, assets and liabilities, including related goodwill, of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The results andcash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling using average rates ofexchange. Exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the period retained by overseas subsidiaries are translated into Sterling are recognised in OtherComprehensive Income. (d) RevenuePCH receives revenue for supply of goods to external customers against orders received. The majority of contracts that PCH enters into relate to sales orders containing single performanceobligations for the delivery of consumer healthcare products. The average duration of a salesorder is less than 12 months. Product revenue is recognised when control of the goods is passed to the customer. The point at which control passes is determined by each customer arrangement, but generally occurs ondelivery to the customer. Product revenue represents net invoice value including fixed and variable consideration. Variable consideration arises on the sale of goods as a result of discounts and allowancesgiven and accruals for estimated future returns and rebates. Revenue is not recognised in fulluntil it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenuerecognised will not occur. The methodology and assumptions used to estimate rebates andreturns are monitored and adjusted regularly in the light of contractual and legal obligations, 437 historical trends, past experience and projected market conditions. Once the uncertainty associated with the returns and rebates is resolved, revenue is adjusted accordingly. Valueadded tax and other sales taxes are excluded from revenue. (e) ExpenditureExpenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms. Provision is made when an obligation exists for a futureliability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliablyestimated. Manufacturing start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normalproduction are expensed as incurred. Advertising and promotion expenditure are charged tothe income statement as incurred. Shipment costs on intercompany transfers are charged tocost of sales, whereas distribution costs on sales to customers are included in selling, generaland administrative ('SG&A') expenditure. Restructuring costs are recognised and provided for, where appropriate, in respect of the direct expenditure of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and welladvanced, and where a valid expectation to those affected has been created by either startingto implement the restructuring plans or announcing its main features. (f) Research and developmentResearch and development ('R&D') expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised from when the requiredregulatory approvals to launch a new product are obtained and the criteria for recognising anasset are met. Property, plant and equipment used for research and development is capitalisedand depreciated in accordance with the policy described below. (g) Legal and other disputesProvision is made for the anticipated settlement costs of legal or other disputes against PCH where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate can be made ofthe likely outcome. PCH may become involved in legal proceedings, in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that could result from ultimateresolution of the proceedings. In these cases, appropriate disclosure about such cases wouldbe included but no provision would be made. Costs associated with claims made by PCHagainst third parties are charged to the income statement as they are incurred. (h) Pensions and other post-employment benefitsThe costs of providing pensions under defined benefit schemes are calculated using the projected unit credit method and spread over the period during which benefit is expected to bederived from the employees' services, consistent with the advice of qualified actuaries. Pensionobligations are measured as the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted atrates reflecting the yields of high-quality corporate bonds. Pension scheme assets aremeasured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The costs of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in a similar way to defined benefit pension schemes and spread over the period during which benefit is expected to be derivedfrom the employees' services, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries. Future cashflows discounted at rates reflecting the yields of high-quality corporate bonds. Pension schemeassets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. PCH's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as incurred. 438 (i) Employee share plans Incentives in the form of shares in PCH's ultimate parent company, Pfizer Inc., are provided to employees under share option and share award schemes. The fair values of these options and awards are calculated at their grant dates using a Black- Scholes option pricing model or other appropriate methods, such as Monte Carlo simulationmodel or intrinsic value method, and charged to the income statement over the relevant vestingperiods. At the end of each reporting period, the Pfizer Group revises its charge based on thenumber of options expected to vest, where appropriate. (j) Property, plant and equipmentProperty, plant and equipment (PP&E) is stated at the cost of purchase or construction less provisions for depreciation and impairment. Financing costs are capitalised within the cost ofqualifying assets under construction. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less residual value of PP&E, excluding freehold land, using the straight-line basis over the expected useful life. Residual values and lives arereviewed, and where appropriate adjusted, annually. The normal expected useful lives of themajor categories of PP&E are: Land - Buildings 33 to 50 years Plant and machinery 8 to 20 years Equipment and vehicles 3 to 12 years On disposal of PP&E, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and impairments are removed from the Historical Financial Information and the net amount, less any proceeds, istaken to the income statement. (k) Intangible AssetsGoodwillGoodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of PCH's share of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired subsidiaries at thedate of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently whereindicators of impairment exist and is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (\" CGU \") for the purpose of impairment testing. A CGU is identified at the lowest aggregation of assets that generate largely independent cashinflows, and that which is looked at by management for monitoring and managing the business.If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss isallocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then tothe other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in theunit. Any impairment is immediately recognised in the income statement and an impairmentloss recognised for goodwill is not subsequently reversed. On disposal, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal. Other intangible assetsIntangible assets are stated at cost less provisions for amortisation and impairments. 439 Licences, patents, know-how and marketing rights separately acquired or acquired as part of a business combination are amortised over their estimated useful lives, generally not exceeding20 years, using the straight-line basis from the time they are available for use. The estimateduseful lives for determining the amortisation charge consider patent lives, where applicable, aswell as the value obtained from periods of non-exclusivity. Asset lives are reviewed, and whereappropriate, adjusted annually. Any development costs incurred and associated with acquired licences, patents, know-how or marketing rights are written off to the income statement when incurred, unless the criteria forrecognition of an internally generated intangible asset are met, usually when a regulatory filinghas been made in a major market and approval is considered highly probable. Acquired brands are valued independently as part of the fair value of businesses acquired from third parties where the brand has a value which is substantial and long term and where thebrands either are contractual or legal in nature or can be sold separately from the rest of thebusinesses acquired. Brands are amortised over their estimated useful lives of up to 20 years,except where it is considered that the useful economic life is indefinite. The costs of acquiring and developing computer software for internal use and internet sites for external use are capitalised as intangible fixed assets where the software or site supports asignificant business system and the expenditure leads to the creation of an asset. ERPsystems software is amortised over seven to ten years and other computer software over threeto five years. (l) LeasesPCH recognises right of use assets under lease arrangements in which it is the lessee. Rights to use assets owned by third parties under lease arrangements are capitalised at the inceptionof the lease and recognised on the balance sheet. The corresponding liability to the lessor isrecognised as a lease obligation within short and long-term borrowings. The carrying amount issubsequently increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced by lease paymentsmade. For calculating the discounted lease liability on leases the implicit rate in the lease is used. If this is not available, the incremental borrowing rate with a lease specific adjustment is used. Ifneither of these is available, the incremental borrowing rate is calculated at the rate of interestat which PCH would have been able to borrow for a similar term and with a similar security thefunds necessary to obtain a similar asset in a similar market. Finance costs are charged to the income statement so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligations for each accounting period. Variable rents are not part of the lease liability and the right of use asset. These payments are charged to the income statement as incurred. Short-term and low value leases are notcapitalised, and lease rentals are charged to the income statement as incurred. Non-lease components are accounted for separately from the lease components in plant and equipment leases but are not separately accounted for in land and buildings or vehicle leases. If modifications or reassessments occur, the lease liability and right of use asset are re-measured. Right of use assets where title is expected to pass to PCH at a point in the future are depreciated on a basis constant with similar owned assets. In other cases, right of use assetsare depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. (m) Impairment of non-current assetsThe carrying values of all non-current assets are reviewed for impairment, either on a stand- alone basis or as part of a larger CGU, when there is an indication that the assets might be 440 impaired. Additionally, goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets which are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. Any provision forimpairment is charged to the income statement. Impairments of goodwill are not reversed. Impairment losses on other non-current assets are only reversed if there has been a change in estimates used to determine recoverable amountsand only to the extent that the revised recoverable amounts do not exceed the carrying valuesthat would have existed, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairments beenrecognised. (n) InventoriesInventories are included in the Historical Financial Information at the lower of cost (including raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads) and netrealisable value. Cost is generally determined on a first in, first out basis. (o) Trade payablesTrade payables are initially recognised at fair value and then held at amortised cost. Long-term payables are discounted where the effect is material. (p) TaxationCurrent tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid applying tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is calculated on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Historical Financial Information. Deferred taxassets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be availableagainst which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is provided on temporarydifferences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of thetemporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will notreverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is provided using rates of tax that have beenenacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilitiesare offset if and only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets andcurrent tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to incometaxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or differenttaxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, orto realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in whichsignificant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settle or recovered.Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit orloss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either inOCI or directly in equity. (q) Financial instrumentsFinancial assetsFinancial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The measurement basis isdetermined by reference to both the business model for managing the financial asset and thecontractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. For financial assets other than tradereceivables a 12-month expected credit loss (ECL) allowance is recorded on initial recognition.If there is subsequent evidence of a significant increase in the credit risk of an asset, theallowance is increased to reflect the full lifetime ECL. If there is no realistic prospect ofrecovery, the asset is written off. 441 Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured in accordance with the business model under which each portfolio of trade receivables is held. PCH has portfolios in two of the three business modelsunder IFRS 9 to collect the contractual cash flows (measured at amortised cost) and to sell thecontractual cash flows (measured at FVTPL). Trade receivables measured at amortised cost are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances for ECL. Expected credit losses are calculated in accordance with the simplifiedapproach permitted by IFRS 9, using a provision matrix applying lifetime historical credit lossexperience to the trade receivables. The expected credit loss rate varies depending on whetherand the extent to which settlement of the trade receivables is overdue and it is also adjusted asappropriate to reflect current economic conditions and estimates of future conditions. For thepurpose of determining credit loss rates, customers are classified into groupings that havesimilar loss patterns. The key drivers of the loss rate are the location and type of customer. When a trade receivable is determined to have no reasonable expectation of recovery it is written off, firstly against any expected credit loss allowance available and then to the incomestatement. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously provided for or written off are credited to the income statement. Long-term receivables are discounted where the effect is material. Cash and cash equivalentsCash held in deposit accounts is measured at amortised cost. Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term highlyliquid deposits with a maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to a knownamount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. BorrowingsAll borrowings are initially recorded at the amount of proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between theproceeds, net of transaction costs, and the amount due on redemption being recognised as acharge to the income statement over the period of the relevant borrowing. Derivative financial instruments and hedgingDerivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks. During the period presented, PCH did not directly use derivative financial instruments to manage itsexposure to market risks, instead the business participated in Pfizer's centralised hedgingprogram. PCH does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculativepurposes. Derivative financial instruments are classified as held-for-trading and are measured at fair value. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are classified on inception as cash flowhedges, net investment hedges or fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedges are effective. Ineffective portionsare recognised in profit or loss immediately. Amounts deferred in other comprehensive incomeare reclassified to the income statement when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Net investment hedges are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. 442 3. Key accounting judgements and estimates In preparing the combined Historical Financial Information, management is required to make judgements about when or how items should be recognised in the combined HistoricalFinancial Information and estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets,liabilities, income and expenses reported in the combined Historical Financial Information.Actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates. The following are considered tobe the critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty. TaxationUncertain Tax PositionsManagement makes the judgement of whether there is sufficient information to be able to make a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute. If insufficient information is available,no provision is made. If sufficient information is available, in estimating a potential tax liability, PCH applies a risk- based approach to determine the transactions most likely to be subject to challenge, assumingthat the relevant tax authority will review and have full knowledge of all the relevantinformation, and the probability that PCH would be able to obtain compensatory adjustmentsunder international tax treaties. These estimates consider the specific circumstances of eachdispute and relevant external advice, are inherently judgemental and could changesubstantially over time as each dispute progresses and new facts emerge. Further details and the factors affecting the tax charge in future years are set out in Note 11 'Taxation'. Where open tax matters exist, the ultimate liability for such matters may vary fromthe amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of negotiations with the relevant taxauthorities or, if necessary, litigation proceedings. Due to the number of uncertain tax positionsheld and the number of jurisdictions to which these relate, it is not practical to give meaningfulsensitivity estimates. Legal and other disputesJudgement and estimatesManagement makes a judgement of whether it is remote, possible or probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle legal obligations. To theextent that the potential outflow is assessed as possible but not probable or insufficientinformation is available to make a judgement on whether a potential outflow is probable, noprovision is made and disclosure related to the claim is provided. For legal obligations that are assessed as leading to a probable outflow and sufficient information is available, the estimated provisions take into account the specific circumstancesof each dispute and relevant external advice, are inherently judgemental and could changesubstantially over time as each dispute progresses and new facts emerge. Details of the statusand various uncertainties involved in the significant unresolved disputes are set out in Note 22,'Contingent Liabilities'. Management, having taken legal advice, have established provisionsafter taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and inaccordance with accounting requirements. PCH may become involved in legal proceedings, in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the expected financial effect, or practicable to give a meaningful range ofoutcomes that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases,appropriate disclosure about such cases would be provided, but no provision would be madeand no contingent liability can be quantified. The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary fromthe amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings,investigations, and possible settlement negotiations. The position could change over time and,therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legalproceedings will not exceed the amount of the provisions reported in PCH's combined financialstatements by a material amount. 443 4. Exchange rates PCH operates in many countries and earns revenues and incurs costs in many currencies. The results of PCH as presented in Sterling, are affected by movements in exchange rates betweenSterling and other currencies. Average exchange rates, as modified by specific transactionrates for large transactions, prevailing during the year, are used to translate the results andcash flows of overseas subsidiaries into Sterling. Year-end rates are used to translate the netassets of those entities. The currencies which most influenced these translations and therelevant exchange rates were: Seven Months Ended 31 July 2019 Average rates Period end rates CNY/\u00a3 8.72 8.38 Euro/\u00a3 1.14 1.09 US$/\u00a3 1.28 1.22 5.

All individuals performing services for PCH are employed and remunerated by PCH companies or other members of the Pfizer group. Where a management charge for wages and salarieshas been made from entities outside PCH, such amounts are not included in wages andsalaries above and it is not practical to separate such amounts from other managementrecharges. Details of Key Management PersonnelKey Management Personnel includes representatives from the PCH leadership team, prior to the completion of the Pfizer Transaction on 31 July 2019. The compensation of KeyManagement Personnel in respect of their services to PCH in aggregate was as follows: Seven Months Ended 31 July 2019 \u00a3m Wages and salaries 2 Social security costs 1 Pension and other post-employment costs - Cost of share-based incentive plans 1 4 8.

Restructuring costs Restructuring costs are primarily related to employee termination costs associated with cost- reduction and productivity initiatives. Employee termination costs are generally recorded whenthe actions are probable and estimable and include accrued severance benefits, pension andpost-retirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination. The balances of the restructuring costs as at 31 July 2019 are included in Note 21 Other Provisions.

PCH operates in countries where the taxrate differs from the US tax rate. The taxable profits and tax rates in those countries also varyfrom year to year. Taxation mattersThe integrated nature of PCH's worldwide operations involves significant investment in research and manufacturing at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-bordersupply routes into numerous end-markets. This gives rise to complexity and delay innegotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies areliable to tax. Management continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities. The ultimate liabilityfor such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome ofagreements with relevant tax authorities or litigation where appropriate. At of 31 July 2019 PCHhad recognised provisions of \u00a368 million in respect of such uncertain tax positions. The aggregate amount of unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately \u00a3493 million. Provision for deferred tax liabilities of \u00a32 million has been made in respect ofwithholding taxation that would arise on the distribution of profits by certain overseassubsidiaries. Deferred tax is not provided on the remainder of temporary differences arising onunremitted profits as management can control any future reversal and does not consider sucha reversal to be probable.

On 31 July 2019 goodwill was assessed for any indicators of impairment. Noindicators were identified and therefore no further impairment assessment was performed. Indefinite life brands and other amortised brandsThe historical cost of the major brands are as follows: As at 31 July 2019 \u00a3m Advil 1,340 Centrum 884 Robitussin 562 Caltrate 427 389 Chapstick 392 Emergen-C 145 Other 201 4,340 Each of these brands is considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of the brand and the level of marketing support. The brands are in relatively similar, stable andprofitable market sectors, with similar risk profiles, and their size, diversification and marketshares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of thebrands is considered to be relatively low. PCH is not aware of any material legal, regulatory,contractual, competitive, economic or other factor which could limit their useful lives.Accordingly, they are not amortised. Each brand is tested annually for impairment and other amortised intangible assets are tested when indicators of impairment arise. Indefinite life brands were tested for impairment as at31 December 2018, and no impairment was recognised. On 31 July 2019 indefinite life brandswere assessed for any indicators of impairment. No indicators were identified and therefore nofurther impairment assessment was performed. 449 For the seven months ended 31 July 2019, amortisation and impairment losses, net of reversals, have been charged in the income statement as follows.

Accruals are made atthe time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after theinitial recognition of the sale. As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reflect the finaloutcome and are subject to change. The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted in the light ofhistorical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made andany changes in arrangements. Future events and uncertainties could cause the assumptionson which the accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of PCH. 19.

Pensions and other post-employment benefits Pension and other post-employment costsSeven Months Ended 31 July 2019 \u00a3m German pension schemes 0.5 French pension schemes0.1 0.6 Analysed as: Defined benefit schemes 0.6 There are four defined benefit PCH pension plans in Germany and one dedicated PCH pension plan in France. Two of the plans in Germany are frozen to future benefit accruals.Pension and other post-employment costs are primarily included in selling, general andadministration expenses. Many of the PCH employees also participate in benefit plans sponsored by Pfizer. The combined income statement includes the service cost associated with direct PCH employeesparticipating in plans that are not dedicated to PCH as well as an allocation of service cost thathas been deemed attributable to PCH operations. The combined balance sheet does notinclude benefit plan assets and liabilities associated with PCH employees participating in plansthat are not dedicated to PCH. The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 65 and projected to apply in 2044 for an individual then at the age of 65 is as follows: As at 31 July 2019 Germany France Male YearsFemale YearsMale YearsFemale Years Current 20.0 23.6 19.0 23.0 Projected for 2044 23.5 26.4 19.0 23.0 The Pension Plans are exposed to risk that arises because the estimated market value of the Plan assets might decline, the investment returns might reduce, or the estimated value of thePlans' liabilities might increase. The Plan liabilities are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration. On an IAS 19 basis, these cash flows are sensitive to changes in the expected rate of compensation increaseand the discount rate (investment grade corporate bond yield curve) where an increase inexpected compensation corresponds with an increase in the liabilities, and an increase in thediscount rate corresponds with a decrease in the liabilities. PCH has applied the following financial assumptions in assessing the defined benefit liabilities: Seven Months Ended 31 July 2019 Germany France %p a %p a Discount rate 2.05% 1.75% Expected rate of compensation increase 2.13% 2.25% 452 The amounts recorded in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income in relation to the defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes were asfollows: Pensions \u00a3m 31 July 2019 Amounts charged to operating profit: Current service cost 0.3 Net interest cost 0.3 0.6 Re-measurements recorded in the statement of comprehensive income - The fair values of the assets and liabilities of the German and French defined benefit pension schemes, together with aggregated data for other defined benefit pension schemes in the PCHare as follows: Germany France Total 31 July 2019 \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m Insurance contracts 5 - 5Fair value of assets 5- 5 Present value of scheme obligations (29) (1) (30)Recognised on the balance sheet (24) (1) (25) Included in post-employment benefits assets - - -Included in post-employment benefits obligations (24) (1) (25) Actual return on plan assets -- - All of PCH's dedicated pension plan assets are associated with one PCH dedicated pension plan in Germany.

Beginning on 1 January, 2011, for newly hired non-union employees, rehires andtransfers to the U.S. or Puerto Rico, Pfizer no longer offers a defined benefit pension plan and,instead, offers a Retirement Savings Contribution (RSC) in the defined contribution plan. TheRSC is an annual non-contributory employer contribution (that is not dependent upon theparticipant making a contribution) determined based on each employee's eligiblecompensation, age and years of service. Beginning on 1 January, 2018, all non-unionemployees in Pfizer's U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit plans transitioned to the RSC in thedefined contribution plans. 454 Contribution expense for direct PCH employees, associated with non-dedicated defined contribution plans, totalled approximately \u00a315 million in the seven months ended 31 July 2019. Post-retirement plansMany of the PCH employees are eligible to participate in post-retirement plans, consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees, sponsored by Pfizer. Pfizer does not fund post-retirement plans, but contributes to the plans as benefits are paid. Service cost expense fordirect PCH employees in Canada, the U.S. and Puerto Rico, participating in post-retirementbenefit plans that are not dedicated to PCH totalled approximately \u00a31.5 million in the sevenmonths ended 31 July 2019. 21.

Details of restructuring provisions can be found in Note 10, 'Restructuring costs'. 22. Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities arise when PCH has a present obligation as a result of a past event and comprise guarantees and other items arising in the normal course of business. Provision is made for the outcome of tax, legal and other disputes where it is both probable that PCH will suffer an outflow of funds and it is possible to make a reliable estimate of thatoutflow. PCH is subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. The most significant of these matters, other than tax matters, are described below. Legal proceedingsPCH makes provision for these proceedings on a regular basis as summarised in Note 2 'Accounting principles and policies' and Note 21 'Other provisions'. PCH has assessed that claims and defences in these matters are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. PCH could incur judgments, enterinto settlements or revise expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and suchdevelopments could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and/or cash flowsin the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or cash flows in the period in which theamounts are paid. 455 Losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued for. Substantially all of PCH's contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determiningwhether a loss is probable and/or the measurement of any loss (if probable) can be complex.Consequently, it is not feasible to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess ofamounts accrued. Assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have beendeemed reasonable by management, but the assessment process relies heavily on estimatesand assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events andcircumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates andassumptions. The principal pending matters to which PCH is a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, PCH considers both quantitative and qualitativefactors in order to assess materiality, such as, among other things, the amount of damagesand the nature of any other relief sought in the proceeding, if such damages and other reliefare specified; PCH's view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of its defences;whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, views of thelikelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding ispending; whether related actions have been transferred to a multi-district litigation; anyexperience that PCH or, to its knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings;whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of the Historical FinancialInformation, including whether disclosure might change a reader's judgment about theHistorical Financial Information in light of all of the information that is available to the reader;the potential impact of the proceeding on PCH's reputation; and the extent of public interest inthe matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters in which PCH is the plaintiff,consideration is given to, among other things, the financial significance of the product protectedby the patent. As a result of considering qualitative factors in the determination of principalmatters, there are some matters discussed below with respect to which management believesthat the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote. Product litigation - Nexium24HR and ProtonixSeveral individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and/or other pharmaceutical manufacturers in various federal and state courtsalleging that the plaintiffs developed kidney-related injuries purportedly as a result of theingestion of certain proton pump inhibitors. The cases against Pfizer involve Nexium24HR and/or Protonix (a Pfizer pharmaceutical product) and seek compensatory and punitive damagesand, in some cases, treble damages, restitution or disgorgement. In August 2017, the federalactions were ordered transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-DistrictLitigation (In re: Proton-Pump Inhibitor Products Liability Litigation (No. II)) in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the District of New Jersey. As part of the consumer healthcare joint venturetransaction with GSK, the joint venture has agreed to assume, and to indemnify Pfizer for,liabilities arising out of such litigation to the extent related to Nexium24HR. GSK Consumer Healthcare is now the defendant in the ongoing proton pump inhibitor (\" PPI\") litigation. As of June 2021, there are approximately 2,500 Nexium24HR personal injurylawsuits pending against GSK Consumer Healthcare, nearly all of which are pending in aMultidistrict Litigation (\" MDL \") proceeding in the District of New Jersey. Manufacturers of other PPIs also are named as co-defendants in the MDL. GSK Consumer Healthcare has filedmotions to dismiss several hundred cases, but the MDL court has not yet ruled on thosemotions. In addition to the MDL cases, a small number of cases are pending in state courts. Guarantees and indemnificationsIn the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, PCH often indemnifies its counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connectionwith the transaction or related to activities prior to or following the transaction. These 456 indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters and patent-infringement claims. If the indemnified party were to make a successfulclaim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, PCH may be required to reimburse the loss.These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically,the business has not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of 31 July 2019,recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant. 23. Invested capital Invested capital \u00a3m Invested capitalAt 1 January 2019 6,006 Movements in the period 498 As at 31 July 2019 6,504 24. Related party transactions The Historical Financial Information includes certain related party transactions.There were no balances from transactions between PCH and Pfizer that are expected to be cash-settled as of 31 July 2019. All balances and transactions between PCH and Pfizer thatare not cash-settled are shown as part of Invested Capital in the combined balance sheet andrepresent the net of amounts settled without payment (to)/from Pfizer. Such amounts arereflected in the combined statement of cash flows based on the cash flows made by Pfizer onbehalf of PCH, with the offset reflected in Net financing activities with Pfizer in the financingsection. Pfizer uses a centralised approach to cash management and financing its operations. During the period covered by these combined financial statements, excess cash was remitted to Pfizeron a regular basis and is reflected within Invested Capital. Similarly, PCH cash disbursementswere predominantly funded through Pfizer's cash accounts and are reflected within InvestedCapital. There are no other amounts or loan amounts owing to or from related parties.Historically, Pfizer has provided significant corporate, manufacturing and shared services functions and resources to PCH.

Financial instruments and related disclosures PCH is a business unit of Pfizer. Pfizer's Treasury function manages and monitors PCH's external and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of PCH's strategicobjectives. Capital managementPCH participated in Pfizer's centralized cash management system and generally all excess cash is transferred to Pfizer on a daily basis. Accordingly, the PCH cash balance as of 31 July,2019 is not representative of an independent company and could be significantly different atanother point in time. Cash disbursements for operations and/or investing activities are fundedas needed by Pfizer. All balances and transactions among PCH and Pfizer that are not cashsettled are shown as part of Invested Capital and represent the net of amounts settled withoutpayment (to)/from Pfizer. Historically, Pfizer provided significant corporate, manufacturing andshared services functions and resources to PCH. The combined financial statements of PCHreflect an allocation of these costs, which PCH believes is a reasonable reflection of theservices received. However, these allocations may not reflect the expenses that would havebeen incurred if PCH had operated as an independent standalone company. Liquidity riskPCH participated in Pfizer's centralized cash management system and generally all excess cash is transferred to Pfizer on a daily basis. Accordingly, the PCH cash balance as of 31 July,2019 of \u00a338 million is not representative of an independent company and could be significantlydifferent at another point in time. Cash disbursements for operations and/or investing activitiesare funded as needed by Pfizer. Market riskInterest rate risk managementPCH does not have external debt and therefore its interest expense is not significantly exposed to changes in interest rates. Although PCH earns interest income on its cash and thereforebenefits from an increase in interest rates, PCH interest income is not significant becausegenerally all excess cash is transferred to Pfizer on a daily basis. Included in the PCHcombined financial statements is an allocation of Pfizer's interest-related expenses associatedwith the Pfizer corporate debt and an allocation of interest income associated with the Pfizercorporate investments. Interest rate benchmark reformPCH is not directly exposed to interest rate benchmark reform since it has no interest rate derivatives as of 31 July, 2019. As a business unit of Pfizer, PCH participated in Pfizer'scentralized hedging activities. Foreign exchange risk managementPCH is subject to foreign exchange risk in its commercial operations and assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a business unit of Pfizer, PCH participated inPfizer's financial risk management program to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate onits earnings. Pfizer addresses this exposure through a combination of operational means and 458 financial instruments. Pfizer adapts its practices periodically as economic conditions change. On the commercial side, a significant portion of PCH revenues and earnings is exposed tochanges in exchange rates. Where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposuresPfizer may use foreign currency exchange contracts and/or foreign currency swaps to managethat risk. Wholesale and retail credit riskPCH used Pfizer Inc. expertise to monitor wholesale credit risk. This risk was managed by Pfizer which used their own internal metrics and systems for monitoring this type of credit risk. Sensitivity analysisThe sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the amount of cash and cash equivalents and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are allconstant. Financial instruments affected by market risk are cash and deposits. The tablesbelow illustrate the estimated impact on the income statement and equity as a result ofhypothetical market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to PCH'sfinancial instruments. The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflectsmanagement's view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Credit riskCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to PCH and arises on cash and cash equivalents held with banks and financialinstitutions as well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers, including outstandingreceivables. Treasury-related credit riskThe aggregate credit risk in respect of financial instruments that PCH may have with one counterparty is limited by reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned for thatcounterparty by Moody's Investors Service (\" Moody's \") and Standard and Poor's. The table below sets out the credit ratings of counterparties for cash and cash equivalents. 2019 AAA/Aaa \u00a3m Bank balances and deposits - 30 1 7 - 38 ---- 3 8 The credit ratings in the above tables are as assigned by Moody's. Where local rating data is the only source available, the ratings are converted to global ratings equivalent to those ofStandard and Poor's or Moody's using published conversion tables. Global counterparty limits are assigned to each of PCH's banking and investment counterparties based on long-term credit ratings from Moody's and Standard and Poor's.PCH's usage of these limits is monitored daily by Pfizer's Corporate Treasury Group as well asPfizer's Corporate Compliance Officer (CCO) who operates independently from PfizerTreasury. Any breach of these limits would be reported to the CFO immediately. The CCO alsomonitors the credit rating of these counterparties and, when changes in ratings occur, notifiesPfizer Treasury so that changes can be made to investment levels or authority limits asappropriate. 459 Financial assets and financial liabilities Seven Months Ended 31 July 2019 Carrying value Fair value \u00a3m \u00a3m Financial assets measured at amortised cost: Cash and cash equivalents 38 38 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Trade and other receivables and certain other non-current assets 499 499 Total financial assets 537 537 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost: Short term loans and overdrafts - - Trade and other payables, Other provisions and certain Other non-current liabilities in scope of IFRS 9(548) (548) Total financial liabilities (548) (548) Net financial assets and financial liabilities (11) (11) The table above presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of PCH's financial assets and liabilities. The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the price thatwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transactionbetween market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: \u0081 Cash and cash equivalents - approximates to the carrying amount\u0081 Receivables and payables - approximates to the carrying amount Trade and other receivables, Other non-current assets, Trade and other payables, Other provisions and Other non-current liabilities are reconciled to the relevant balance sheetamounts in tables below. Trade and other receivables and Other non-current assets in scope of IFRS 9The following table reconciles financial instruments within Trade and other receivables and Other non-current assets which fall within the scope of IFRS 9 to the relevant balance sheetamounts. The financial assets are predominantly non-interest earning. Non-financialinstruments include tax receivables and prepayments, which are outside the scope of IFRS 9.

PCH has considered movements in these currencies and hasconcluded that a 10% movement in rates is a reasonable benchmark. Financial instrumentsare only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates where they are not in the functionalcurrency of the entity that holds them. Seven Months Ended 31 July 2019 Increase/(Decrease) in income \u00a3m 10% appreciation of the Chinese Yuan 0.3 10% appreciation of the US dollar 0.110% depreciation of the Chinese Yuan (0.3) 10% depreciation of the US dollar (0.1) Interest rate sensitivity PCH is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments where any changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of financial instruments. The table below shows PCH's hypothetical sensitivity to changes in interest rates in relation to Canadian dollar, US dollar, Euro and South African Rand variable rate financial assets andliabilities. If the interest rates applicable to floating rate financial assets and liabilities were tohave increased by 1% (100 basis points), and assuming other variables had remainedconstant, it is estimated that PCH's finance income for the period would have increased byapproximately \u00a30.3 million. A 1% (100 basis points) movement in interest rates is not deemedto have a material effect on equity.

Employee share schemes PCH compensation programs include grants under Pfizer's share-based payment programmes. The combined income statement includes all of the share-based paymentexpenses directly attributable to PCH. The expenses include allocations of direct expenses aswell as expenses that have been deemed attributable to PCH operations. Compensationprograms at PCH can include share-based payments under various Pfizer employee stock andincentive plans. The award value is determined by reference to the fair value of share-basedawards to similar employees in competitive survey data or industry peer groups used forcompensation purposes; and is allocated between different long term incentive vehicles, in theform of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), Stock Options, Total Shareholder Return Units(TSRUs), Portfolio Performance Shares (PPSs) and Performance Share Awards (PSAs) andProfit Units (PTUs), as determined by the Pfizer Compensation Committee. The pre-tax share-based compensation charge for the above schemes (including allocated amounts) has been recorded in the income statement of \u00a319.6 million for the seven monthsended 31 July, 2019 (\u00a32.8 million in Cost of sales; \u00a313.5 million in Selling, general andadministrative expenses; and \u00a33.3 million in Research and development expenses), which isconsidered immaterial for further disclosure. This expense is incurred in the form of a chargefrom Pfizer Inc. No further disclosures have been made since the share plans are with Pfizerand not PCH and post-acquisition these plans do not transfer over with PCH to GSK ConsumerHealthcare. 462 29.
