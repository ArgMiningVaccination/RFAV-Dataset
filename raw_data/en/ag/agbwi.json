Freeze - dried has very little. Ageing the garlic reduce odor and sulfur components. -Odorless aged garlic eliminates most of alliin. Dosage : Start with 250 -1500 mg daily Garlic Efficacy : Garlic is believed to reduce atherosclerosis/lipids by suppressing oxidized LDL and through antithrombotic effects. Antidiabetic effects include lowering glucose in people with or without diabetes. Found to stimulate insulin secretion from beta -cells. Antimicrobial effects are attributed to allicin which is believed to inhibit RNA synthesis and reduce DNA and protein synthesis.

Garlic has been shown to have mild improvements in LDL chol lowering A meta -analysis of Garlic and BP suggested improvements in BP in hypertensive patients. Aged Garlic Extract Retards Progression of Coronary Artery Description : Vitamin K2 serves an important role in cardiovascular health through regulation of calcium homeostasis. Its effects on the cardiovascular system are mediated through activation of the anti -calcific protein known as matrix Glaprotein. In its inactive form, this protein is associated with various markers of cardiovascular disease including increased arterial stiffness, vascular and valvular calcification, insulin resistance and heart failure indices. Vitamin K is a fat -soluble vitamin and occurs as two vitamers, namely and K2 Description : Vitamin K2 plays role in the activation of extrahepatic -carboxyglutamate ( Gla) proteins such as matrix Glaprotein (MGP), a small 84 -amino acid (14 kDa) protein that is commonly considered the strongest inhibitor of vascular calcification. MGP undergoes post -translational modification for complete maturation into -glutamate carboxylation which is vitamin -K dependent. PEARL: dp-ucMGP established biomarker for vitamin K deficiency. MGP regulates calcification directly by inhibiting formation and solubilisation of calcium crystals and through alternative calcification inhibitors such as fetuin -A, as well as indirectly via modulating transcription factors that suppress differentiation of VSMC to an osteoblast -like phenotype. Essa Hariri et al. Open Heart 2021;8:e001715Vitamin K2 Dosage : The effective recommended dose of longer chain MKs (MK-7, MK -8 and MK -9) for cardiovascular health benefits is 180-360 \u00b5g/day. Efficacy : Studies showed massive arterial calcification and aortic rupture in MGP knockout mice. Accumulating evidence highlights a relationship between a low state of circulating vitamin K, signified by elevated dp-ucMGP , and the development and progression of CVD and mortality. In some studies, surrogate markers of calcification have been reduced with vit K2 supplementation. Cost: ~ $20/month Essa Hariri et al. Open Heart 2021;8:e001715Vitamin K2 Interactions : none known Safety : Typically considered safe Studies showed no increase in hypercoagulable state Evidence : Multiple studies have evaluated the role of vit K2 in arterial calcification and stiffness. Pearl : Statins are associated with an increase in CAC. Statin use is associated with vit K deficiency which may in part be an explanation for increased CAC with statin use. Statins, vascular calcification, and vitamin K -dependent proteins: Kaohsiung J Med -631Vitamin K2 L-Arginine Indication : angina, hypertension, erectile dysfunction, and possibly microvascular dysfunction. Also used for intermittent claudication, diabetes, pre -eclampsia, pregnancy -induced hypertension, and improving athletic performance Description : An amino acid involved in several processes in the body, including energy production, detoxification, and protein synthesis. L -arginine is produced primarily in the kidneys from its precursor citrulline. L -arginine is classified as a conditionally essential amino acid, which means that under certain conditions, such as stress, the body cannot produce adequate amounts of L -arginine and it must be obtained from dietary sources. Dosage : Start with 500 mg twice daily (Doses are 1 gm -20 gm daily) L-Arginine Efficacy : L-arginine is a substrate for the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme. NOS in vascular endothelial cells converts L -arginine to nitric oxide (NO), also known as endothelium -derived relaxation factor which results in vasodilation. L-arginine can coronary endothelial function and -dependent dilation and reduce monocyte/endothelial cell adhesion patients with CAD. Cost : ~ $35 (wide variance in cost) Interactions : Antihypertensive medications Safety : Typically considered safe Rare Bloating, diarrhea, dizziness, nausea Association of L -arginine supplementation with markers of endothelial function in patients with cardiovascular or metabolic disorders: A systematic review and meta -analysis. Nutrients 2019 Jan; 11(1): 15L-Arginine Evidence : Compared with placebo, L -arginine intervention significantly lowered systolic BP by 5.39 mm Hg (95% CI -8.54 to -2.25, P = .001) and diastolic BP by 2.66 mm Hg (95% CI -3.77 to -1.54, P < .001). In a large meta -analysis looking at blood flow and biochemical markers, when adjusting for increased heterogeneity level, l -arginine supplementation may have a positive impact on blood flow responses, and perhaps could be used as a strategy to improve endothelial function in the selected group of patients.

Nutrients 15 Magnesium Indication : Description: Magnesium is an essential mineral for optimal metabolic function. Research has shown that the mineral content of magnesium in food sources is declining, and that magnesium depletion has been detected in persons with some chronic diseases. Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular divalent cation and is a cofactor for more than 300 metabolic reactions in the body. Pearl: Studies estimate that 75 percent of Americans do not meet the recommended dietary allowance of magnesium. Magnesium Dosage: ~ 250 mg once or twice daily (glycinate) Efficacy : Magnesium plays a significant role in glucose and insulin metabolism, mainly through its impact on tyrosine kinase activity, phosphorylase b kinase activity, and glucose transporter protein activity. Various metabolic processes include protein synthesis, cellular energy production and storage, cell growth and reproduction, DNA and RNA synthesis, and stabilization of mitochondrial membranes. Magnesium is one of the minerals responsible for managing bone metabolism, nerve transmission, cardiac excitability, neuromuscular conduction, muscular contraction, vasomotor tone, and blood pressure. Magnesium Cost: Cheap ~ $10/month Interactions : Avoid with levodopa/carbidopa Safety : Common diarrhea, GI irritation, Lucid dreams RareOverdose can cause severe reactions including loss of reflexes, respiratory depression and cardiac dysrhythmias. Pearl : There are many different forms of magnesium. Magnesium Oxide is the most prescribed form but the least absorbable. Magnesium glycinate (chelated) --Magnesium citrate is the most popular magnesium supplement, probably because it is inexpensive and easily absorbed. Since citric acid is a mild laxative, magnesium citrate functions as a constipation aid as well as a magnesium source. It is a great choice for individuals with rectal or colon problems but is unsuitable for those with loose bowel movements. Magnesium taurate --Magnesium taurate is the best choice of magnesium supplement for people with cardiovascular issues, since it is known to prevent arrhythmias and guard the heart from damage caused by heart attacks. Magnesium taurate is easily absorbed (magnesium and taurine stabilize cell membranes together), and it contains no laxative properties. Magnesium malate --Magnesium malate is a fantastic choice for people suffering from fatigue, since malic acid --a natural fruit acid present in most cells in the body --is a vital component of enzymes that play a key role in ATP synthesis and energy production. Since the ionic bonds of magnesium and malic acid are easily broken, Magnesium bound with glycine, a non -essential amino acid) is one of the most bioavailable and absorbable forms of magnesium, and also the least likely to induce diarrhea. It is the safest option for correcting a long -term deficiency. Magnesium chloride --Though magnesium chloride only contains around 12 percent elemental magnesium, it has an impressive absorption rate and is the best form of magnesium to take for detoxing the cells and tissues. Moreover, chloride (not to be confused with chlorine, the toxic gas) aids kidney function and can boost a sluggish metabolism. Magnesium carbonate --Magnesium carbonate is another popular, bioavailable form of magnesium that actually turns into magnesium chloride when it mixes with the hydrochloric acid in our stomachs. It is a good choice for people suffering from indigestion and acid reflux, since it contains antacid properties. The worst forms of magnesium Magnesium oxide --Magnesium oxide is the most common form of magnesium sold in pharmacies, but it is non -chelated and possesses a poor absorption rate compared to those listed above. Magnesium sulfate --Magnesium sulfate, also called Epsom salt, is a fantastic constipation aid but an unsafe source of dietary magnesium, since overdosing on it is easy. Magnesium glutamate and aspartate --Avoid these two forms of magnesium completely. Glutamic acid and aspartic acid are components of the dangerous artificial sweetener aspartame, and both of them become neurotoxic when unbound to other amino acidsMagnesium Evidence : -Magnesium has been shown to lower BP as much as 5.8/2.8 mmHg. -Magnesium has been shown to reduce post -op afib after cardiac surgery -Circulating and dietary magnesium are inversely associated with CVD risk, which supports the need for clinical trials to evaluate the potential role of magnesium in the prevention of CVD and IHD. Pearl: Drugs like loop diuretics and PPIs can cause significant magnesium wasting. Drugs like potassium -sparing diuretics can increase magnesium levels The role of magnesium in hypertension and cardiovascular disease. J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich). 2011 Nov;13(11):843 -7.
