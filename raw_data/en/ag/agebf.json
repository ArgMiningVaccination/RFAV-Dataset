Consequently, issues surrounding the adequacy and safety of vaccinations to protect pet animals from their relevant infectious diseases need to be addressed just as they are for humans. Pet animals, especially canines, also have unique needs because of the wide diversity of purebred and mixed breeds that vary greatly in size, type, temperament, and even maturation rates. Furthermore, pets in early life encounter a series of changes that can affect their development and induce stressors including parasite control, new homes and environment, novel foods, and the socialization that is essential at a time when vaccinations need to be given. While recognizing that this overall need is becoming more understood, current vaccination policy guidelines for companion animals are still only adhered to by about 40% of veterinarians worldwide. Clearly, vaccination of pets should no longer be considered as \"one size fits all\".", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-01-27", "cleaned_text": "Early Life Vaccination of Companion Animal Pets [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9020092](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9020092) [Vaccines in Small Ruminants]( maternally derived immunity from colostrum milk wanes, the infant becomes susceptible to disease exposures until his own adaptive immunity and immune memory develops and becomes functional events, termed the \"window of susceptibility\", the infant is at risk for succumbing to infectious diseases [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00092)]. [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00092), [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00092), [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00092), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00092)]. Both the innate and adaptive (acquired) immune systems and immune memory evolve along with the functional roles of the pituitary-thyroid-hypothalamic axis, the thymus gland and its gradual involution, and the maturation of the microbiome in bursal-dependent (B-cell) and thymus-dependent (T-lymphocytes) that respond to an immune stimulus, whether an infection or vaccination [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00092)]. These cells replicate when responding to an invading antigen, form clones that retain information about each prior exposure, and thereby generate immune memory. Following this exposure, serum antibody levels begin to rise in about a week and peak around 10 days [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00092), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00092)]. Antibody levels then decline but remain higher than in the naive unexposed state. If the same immune stimulus is encountered again, the immune system mounts a faster and more powerful anamnestic response, such as with viral exposures and vaccines [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00092), [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00092), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00092)]. While the immune system's capacity for memory generates immunity through vaccines, it can also trigger adverse events such as autoimmune disorders and of the gut microbiome in the development and function of the immune system may ultimately affect vaccine efficacy as well [ [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00092)]. Early Life adaptive immune responses work together to eliminate pathogens from the body. There are two types of adaptive responses: the cell-mediated immune response, controlled by activated T-cells, and the humoral immune response, controlled by activated B-cells and antibodies. Adaptive immunity is defined by the presence of either T- or B-lymphocytes, and includes both CD8+ cytotoxic effector T-cells that directly tumor that regulate CD8+ T-cell and B-cell function, and B-cells that present antigen and produce antibodies. The regulatory and effector molecules of this adaptive immune response sustain the antigen-antibody binding functions that release effector cytokines (small cell signaling molecules) and their specific family of chemokines that direct chemotaxis and attract cells to sites of inflammation and infection. The important cytokines include the chemokines, interferons, interleukins, and immune response [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00092), [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00092), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00092), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00092)]. In many species, except dogs, cats, and mice, the thymus starts decreasing in size at birth, although the immunosenescence associated with a decline in thymic output is an stress, infections, pregnancy, and malnutrition [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00092)]. [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00092)]. For example, smaller breeds that live longer than large and giant breeds have varying amounts of growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and interleukin -7 (IL-7) that influence T-cell development and their rate of aging. Interestingly, no sex differences have been identified with thymus function and development [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00092), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00092)]. 2. Vaccine Issues Revisited 2.1. Summary on Vaccine Policy [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00092)]: - No vaccine is always safe, no vaccine is always protective and no vaccine is always indicated. - Misunderstanding, misinformation and the conservative nature of our profession have largely slowed adoption of protocols advocating decreased frequency of vaccination. [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092)]: - Vaccination should be just one part of a holistic preventive healthcare program for pets that is most simply delivered within the framework of an annual health check consultation. - Vaccination is an act of veterinary science that should be considered as individualized medicine, tailored for the needs of the individual pet, and delivered as one part of a preventive medicine program in an annual health check visit. 2.1.1. Vaccination May Not Result not always produce the needed or desired immune protective response, not only if the vaccine itself was inadequately prepared (exceedingly rare) but also if the pet is a genetic low or non-responder to that vaccine (may be common in certain breeds of dogs and their latter case, that pet will be susceptible lifelong to the disease of concern and revaccination will not help and could even be harmful [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00092), [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00092), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00092)]. 2.1.2. New [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00092)]. These include: (1) giving the puppy or kitten vaccine series later (starting not before 8 weeks of age, except in the cases of outbreaks of virulent viral disease, in orphans, or those that never received colostrum from their dams) followed by a booster at one year of age; (2) administering further boosters in a combination vaccine every three years or as split components alternating every other year until; (3) the pet reaches geriatric age, at which time booster vaccination is likely to be unnecessary (except when legally required), and can be unsafe for those with aging-related or immunologic disorders. 2.1.3. distinguish between immunity generated by vaccination and/or exposure to the disease, although the magnitude of immunity produced just by vaccination is usually lower [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00092), [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00092), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), immune system contributes to a weak and T-helper cell type -2 (Th2) polarized immunity [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00092), [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00092), [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00092), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00092), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00092)]. This state of immunity in early life sustains endemic infections in humans and continuous reinfections in animal herds [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00092), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00092), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00092), [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00092), [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00092)]. The endemic infections of the young occur preferentially when the immune system is still functionally immature and when the low levels of maternal antibodies are no longer protective, but yet block protective immune responses [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00092), [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00092), [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00092), [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00092), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00092), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00092), [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00092)]. The Th2 bias of the newborn is mediated by high levels of progesterone and Th2 cytokines produced in Viral exposures at a young age are important to promote proper immune system development [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00092), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00092), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00092), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00092), [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00092), [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00092)]. In addition, the immune system is continuously stimulated by systemic commensal viruses at low levels sufficient to develop resistance to other infections. Additionally, newborns can have their immune systems primed by exposure to innocuous environmental antigens, such as non-pathogenic bacteriophages, and noroviruses in humans [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00092), [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00092)]. This has a strong lifelong effect with subsequent exposure boosts. Importantly, this priming effect can be modulated by adjuvants that focus on modulating T-helper In various species, including mice, dog, sheep, horse, and seal, a strong Th1 stimulating adjuvant can induce immune responsiveness and protection in newborns, even when conventional vaccines fail [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00092)]. 2.1.5. Clinical Utilization of Vaccine Policy [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00092), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00092)]. Thus, the clinical efficacy and safety of vaccination protocols are essential in achieving this goal [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092)]. As discussed below, not all vaccines are considered to be essential, and the need for optional, non-essential vaccines depends upon the geographical exposure risk and lifestyle of the pet and caregiver [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092)]. Local veterinary groups and public health agencies can offer up-to-dare data listings of the area's zoonotic and infectious disease cases in companion animal dogs and cats [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092)]. 2.1.6. Role of Governmental Regulatory Oversight [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00092)]. The agency's December 2020 report represents an update of the recent additions and changes with regard to veterinary vaccines. A second goal of the report was to increase the transparency of veterinary adverse reaction reports and describe the current efficacy and safety standards required by the USDA for product licensure [ [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00092)]. This report is especially timely given the global impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, and the increasing number of vaccine skeptics and naysayers throughout the world [ [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00092)]. 2.2. Some Beneficial Effects of Vaccines 2.2.1. A Widely Recognized World Invention [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00092)]. Today, this original approach of variolation has evolved to become modern vaccination practices, which are now mostly standardized worldwide [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00092), [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00092), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00092)]. Vaccination helps to protect humans, companion animals, livestock, wildlife, and birds from their respective common infectious diseases debilitating, and even fatal [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00092)]. Thus, we must balance this benefit-risk equation. As Professor Ronald Schultz has stated, \"Be wise and immunize, but immunize wisely!\" 2.2.3. Saving Countless Human and Animal Lives 2.2.4. Serious Infectious Diseases Controlled or Eradicated [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00092)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00092), [44](#B44-vaccines-09-00092)]. [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00092), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092)]. Postvaccinal [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00092), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00092), [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00092)]. In the case of more delayed reactions, these can occur up to 45 days and even 60 days later, especially with rabies vaccines containing thimerosal seriously under-reported to the manufacturers and government regulatory [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00092)]. incoordination and weakness, separation anxiety, destruction and shredding of objects, unprovoked aggression, obsessiveness, barking, fearfulness, [ Predisposition to Adverse Vaccine Events [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00092)]. The recently weaned young puppy or kitten being placed in a new environment may be at particular risk. Furthermore, while the frequency of vaccinations is recommended to be spaced 2-4 weeks apart, some veterinarians advocate giving vaccines once a week in perceived or legitimate high exposure risk situations [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00092), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092)]. This practice makes little sense scientifically or medically, and clearly can be harmful. 2.3.3. Vaccine Dosage [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00092)]. Yet, why do very small and very large dogs need the same dose of vaccines, when the manufacturer's vaccine clinical trials are typically performed on laboratory beagles and with minimal field testing in different breed types prior to licensing [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00092), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092)]? [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00092), [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00092)]. Toy and smaller dogs logically should require less vaccine than giant and large dogs to be fully immunized [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00092)]. Similarly, puppies and kittens should require less vaccine volume to immunize than adults. In support of the size hypothesis, this author studied healthy adult, small breed dogs that had not been vaccinated for at least three years. They were given a half-dose of bivalent canine distemper and parvovirus (DPV) vaccine, whereby all of them developed increased and sustained serum vaccine antibody titers Other issues with over-vaccination include increased costs in time and dollars spent, despite the well-intentioned solicitation of clients so that pets can also receive a wellness examination. Giving unnecessary annual boosters has the client paying for services that likely are of little benefit to the pet's existing level of protection against these infectious diseases. It also increases the risk of adverse reactions from the repeated exposure to foreign substances into vaccines to enhance their immunogenicity, but this increases risk of autoimmune and inflammatory adverse events following vaccination [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00092), [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00092), [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00092), [58](#B58-vaccines-09-00092), [59](#B59-vaccines-09-00092)]. For the killed vaccines available for human and veterinary use, potent adjuvants and additives are included to produce a more sustained humoral immune response and compete favorably with the longer protection typically afforded by MLV products. While current vaccine adjuvants can successfully generate humoral antibody-mediated protection, other diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria require a cell-mediated immune response for adequate protection. Importantly, while killed, inactivated vaccines containing adjuvants make up only about 15% of veterinary biologicals used, they have been associated with 85% of the post vaccination have been used safely in human and veterinary medicine for decades, and millions of doses have been given with relatively few documented adverse events, there is increasing worldwide concern about the safety of using heavy metals such as thimerosal (mercury) and the term used to remind us all that vaccines carry an inherent risk, albeit small [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00092)]. Vigorous opposition to this belief is also ongoing [ [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00092)]. 2.3.6. aluminum and mercury in adjuvants for these vaccines is intended to boost the antigen-specific immune responses to make the vaccines work more quickly or effectively. Of concern, however, is the fact that these adjuvants can cross the blood-brain barrier and remain there indefinitely [ [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00092)]. When added to the expected low level of dietary ingestion, these metals can then accumulate in the body and can lead to liver damage, gastrointestinal inflammation, kidney damage, and brain toxicity. Ultra-trace minerals, including chromium, nickel, molybdenum, silica, and aluminum, are not regulated by the National Research Council (NRC) or the American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), and there are currently no set safe upper limits, especially for dry pet foods [ [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00092)]. Except for aluminum which has no known nutritional role, other minerals do play a role in metabolism and have specific dietary requirements. These findings indicate that the potential for adverse effects following exposure to and accumulation of heavy metals in vaccinations and other sources merits further is an urgent need to remove heavy metals from all vaccines, especially from those given to human and animal neonates and infants [ [49](#B49-vaccines-09-00092), [50](#B50-vaccines-09-00092), [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00092), [52](#B52-vaccines-09-00092), [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00092)]. A safer alternative, calcium phosphate, has been approved by the World Health Organization and is naturally present in the body. Future vaccines will hopefully utilize calcium phosphate or other, safer alternatives to aluminum or other metals [ [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00092), [59](#B59-vaccines-09-00092)]. 2.4. Compliance or Resistance to the public need to follow the national and international policies on vaccination guidelines [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00092)]. Is it a matter of public distrust of the veterinarian's role in earning income from promoting annual boosters or unnecessary vaccinations during \"wellness visits\" [ [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00092), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00092), [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00092), [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00092)]? Admittedly, some veterinarians continue to assure their clients that there is no scientific evidence linking vaccinations with adverse effects and serious illness; this fallacy can confuse an impressionable client. On the other hand, vaccine and antivaccine zealots abound with hysteria and misinformation [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00092), [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00092)]. Neither of these polarized views are helpful. Given that clinicians may not understand the principles of vaccinal immunity, it is perhaps not surprising that attempts to change vaccines and vaccination programs for pets and people have created an ongoing debate and controversy [ [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00092), [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00092), [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00092)]. 2.5. Treatment of Vaccinosis [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092)]. The recently vaccinated animal that is unwell can be given the very safe oral homeopathics Thuja (for all vaccines other than rabies) and Lyssin to alleviate the symptoms of a vaccine-induced rabies miasm (molecular energy). This therapy should be given even if the clinical symptoms are actually unrelated to the recent vaccination. Therapy also often includes modest doses of steroids in tapering doses over 4-6 weeks to help stop the inflammatory process and clinical symptoms [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092)]. 2.6. Alternatives to Current Pet triennially or more often if needed, one can assess whether a given animal's humoral immune response has fallen below levels of adequate vaccine booster can be administered. 2.6.1. the so-called \"fallacy of titer testing\" because research has shown that once an animal's titer stabilizes, it is likely to remain constant for many years [ [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00092), [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00092)]. Properly immunized animals have sterilizing immunity that not only prevents clinical disease but also prevents infection, and only the presence of antibody promoted by immune memory can prevent infection. As stated by eminent expert Professor Ronald Schultz in discussing the value of vaccine titer testing, these tests \"show that an animal with a positive test has sterilizing immunity and should be protected from infection\". If that animal were vaccinated, it would not respond with a significant increase in antibody titer, but may develop a hypersensitivity to vaccine components (e.g., fetal bovine serum). Furthermore, the animal does not need to be revaccinated and should not be revaccinated since the vaccine could cause an adverse reaction (hypersensitivity disorder). You should avoid vaccinating animals that are already protected. It is often said that the antibody level detected is \"only a snapshot in time\". That is simply not true; it is more a \"motion picture that plays for years\". [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092)]. While non-sterile immunity may not protect the animal from infection, it should keep the infection from progressing to severe clinical disease [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00092), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00092)]. 2.6.2. of immunity to rabies in vaccinated dogs extends beyond 3 years; (ii) immunologic memory exists even in vaccinated dogs with serum antibody titer 0.1 IU/mL; and (iii) non-adjuvanted recombinant rabies vaccine induces excellent antibody responses in previously vaccinated dogs 14 days after administration. 3. The Author's Preferred Vaccination Protocol [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00092-t001)). 3.1. Safety and Socialization 3.1.1. Puppies - Until fully vaccinated, puppies should not walk on unfamiliar or public grounds; they can be carried about, when needed to travel. - If titer testing is desired, instead of giving another vaccine after 12 weeks of age, wait until at least 16 weeks of age to avoid measuring residual maternal immunity. 3.1.2. Kittens - Socialization and vaccine titer testing options are as for puppies. 4. Discussion [66](#B66-vaccines-09-00092)]. Even before that, this approach was used privately by Benjamin Jesty in 1774 to protect his family from smallpox [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00092), [66](#B66-vaccines-09-00092)]. Since then, for nearly 100 years, vaccines have been used commercially and for research in humans and animals to elicit protective immunity to specific infectious agents in vaccine-related issues, this topic continues to be one of the most contentious of all human and animal medical safety and efficacy procedures [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00092), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [58](#B58-vaccines-09-00092), [59](#B59-vaccines-09-00092), [60](#B60-vaccines-09-00092), [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00092), [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00092)]. Regardless, new approaches and research tools are still needed to effect worldwide protection from current and emerging infectious diseases not only for humans, but also for companion animals, pocket pets, birds, laboratory animals, livestock, and wildlife recognized contributors, albeit relatively rare, to immune-mediated blood, skin, bowel, bone, and joint diseases; bone marrow and organ failure; central nervous system predisposition has been documented [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00092), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00092)]. It must be recognized, however, that we have the luxury of expressing these concerns today only because the risk of disease has been effectively reduced by the widespread use of vaccination programs problems with allergic and immunological diseases have been linked to the introduction of MLV vaccines more than 20 years ago [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00092), [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00092), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00092)]. The accumulated evidence indicates that vaccination protocols should no longer be considered as a \"one size fits Reluctance to change current vaccination programs is fueled by the lack of understanding of the principles of applied vaccinal immunity, which is rarely taught even at the estimated 40% of veterinarians follow the latest vaccine policy guidelines, as they have no regulatory authority [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00092), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00092)]. Many pet caregivers receive written or telephone reminders that their pet is \"due\" for vaccinations or is \"up-to-date\" on vaccinations [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00092)]. [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00092)]. The collective experience of the scientific community depends upon the development and implementation of new technologies [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00092), [67](#B67-vaccines-09-00092), One novel approach used electron-microscopy to determine if there were solid particulate contaminants in vaccines [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00092)]. Micro- and nano-sized particulates composed of inorganic elements were found in 43 of 44 vaccines studied, despite the fact that they were not declared among the components. The only vaccine without these particles was a feline 3-way vaccine; all the others were human vaccines made by a variety of manufacturers and for various diseases, including those for typhoid, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, hepatitis B, polio, Hemophilus influenza, measles, mumps and rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, pneumococcus, and meningococcus [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00092)]. [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00092)]. It identifies candidate vaccine antigens and is highly sensitive, although the technique is not specific and not hypothesis driven. To date, it has been used in studies of meningococci and tuberculosis organisms which were made possible once whole genome sequencing technology was available. The future intent is to replace today's vaccine adjuvants and non-toxic derivatives of toxins with \"trained-immunity based vaccines\" [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00092)]. 4.2. Modified-Live versus Killed, Inactivated Vaccines [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00092)]. The hotly debated costs, convenience, and risks concerning live (Sabin) versus inactivated (Salk) human polio vaccines is one example. As stated above, 10% of licensed and used veterinary biologicals are of the killed, inactivated type and yet they account for 85% of the reported postvaccinal adverse reactions [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00092)]. This discordancy is thought to be caused by the effects of various adjuvants and other excipients (cell tissue culture remnants, egg protein, fetal calf serum, human and bovine serum albumin, yeast proteins, squalene, formaldehyde, antibiotics like neomycin and gentamicin, and other proprietary additives) used in vaccines for humans and other species in vaccine pharmacovigilance? As vaccines are generally viewed by the medical community and public as inherently safe, toxicity studies do not have to be included in regulatory safety assessments [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00092)]. 4.3. equation needs to be assessed in each individual before vaccination. The side effects of vaccines appear to be increasing lately in frequency and severity, particularly in children and in young pets [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00092), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00092), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092)]. The diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine has been linked to cases of sudden infant death syndrome; measles-mumps-rubella vaccine with autism; high-titer measles vaccines with childhood mortality; multiple immunizations with immune disorders; hepatitis B vaccines with multiple sclerosis, and the recent serious local or systemic adverse effects from the human papillomavirus vaccine [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00092), [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00092)]. 4.4. Reducing Exposure Risk [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00092)]. The typically recommended annual vaccine boosters for pet animals are not necessary and may be unwise in most cases, since the clinically important so-called \"core\" vaccines have a much longer duration of immunity than previously thought [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092)]. Boosters should be given only when absolutely necessary (such as with inadequate serum titer immunity to a \"core\" vaccine). [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00092), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [67](#B67-vaccines-09-00092)]. However, all rabies vaccines given to animals, as well as vaccines for canine leptospirosis, Lyme, canine influenza, and the injectable form of Bordetella are killed adjuvanted vaccines [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00092), [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00092), [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00092), [63](#B63-vaccines-09-00092)]. Cats have more vaccine options in comparison to dogs. For example, a non-adjuvanted feline rabies vaccine is available [ [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00092), [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00092)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00092)]. A recent study in dogs addressed the potential immune modulating effect(s) of stimulating specific acupuncture points along the body's meridian system, GV-14, as practiced in Traditional Chinese Medicine [ [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00092)]. This randomized trial used canine distemper virus (CDV) vaccine in 100 healthy client-owned dogs, ages 1-10 years, and quantitated the immune response after vaccination in both control and acupuncture groups. No significant differences were found between groups in age, weight, or sex, and both groups had highly significant increases in CDV serum neutralization titer post vaccination. The mean serum titer increase in the acupuncture group, however, was significantly greater than that of the control group. Thus, acupoint vaccination has the potential to enhance the immune response to this immunological challenge [ [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00092)]. 5. Summary 6.
