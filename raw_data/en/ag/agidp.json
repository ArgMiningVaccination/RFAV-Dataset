Along with Quakers and Congregationalists,Baptists emerged among those who rejected estab-lished religion and creed-oriented religious faith.

Anordained Baptist minister, he was previously Professor of Christian Ethicsat the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.THESOUTHERN BAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSBaptists emerged in the South in 1696 when pastor William Screven led his congregationfrom Kittery, Maine, to Charleston, South Car-olina, where they absorbed local Baptists whohad met since the 1680s as house churches. 2 Baptists were also shaped by north-south divi-sions in America. The Triennial Convention wasa national Baptist body from which southernerswithdrew when its Foreign Mission Boardrefused to appoint slaveholders. The SouthernBaptist Convention (SBC) was subsequentlyorganized in Augusta, Georgia, in 1845. The oldconvention was predominantly northern and hassince become the American Baptist Convention(ABC). The southern convention did not devel-op its own publishing house, however, until1885. From such humble origins Southern Bap-tists have become the largest Protestant denomi-nation in the United States, boasting a member-ship of over 45,000 contributing churches andin excess of 15 million people. Its constituencyis drawn from all fifty states but its greatest con-centration and influence remain in the South. BAPTIST THEOLOGY , POLITY, AND ETHICS Southern Baptists are a complex and diverse people, and thus are impossible to define insimple terms. Considerable variety exists amongthem regarding theological issues and appropri-ate responses to particular social problems. Thepopular notion that a Baptist is a Christian whobelieves in immersion and personal regeneration is true but inadequate. Diverse theological andsociological traditions are reflected in whoSouthern Baptists have become. Even so, theyfind significant commonality in commitments tobiblical authority, believer's baptism by immer-sion, congregational or democratic church gov-ernance, and religious liberty. 3 Where ethical questions are concerned, doc- trines such as the priesthood of the believer, theleadership of the Holy Spirit in individual andcorporate decisions, the universality of sin, thepossibility of personal regeneration (new birth),the freedom of conscience under the lordship of Christ, and separation of church and state are ofcritical importance. Baptist theology builds onthe New Testament insight that faith is a matterof personal trust and relationship to God, notintellectual assent to confessional or dogmaticstatements. Emphases on personal responsibilityand the private nature of faith make it bothunderstandable and predictable that strong dif-ferences of opinion would exist among Baptists.Their origins in dissent and their insistence on freedom may represent the most important char-acteristics of the mindset of this diverse andcomplex people. Historically, Southern Baptists were held together by a common commitment to missionsand the belief that cooperation was more impor-tant than unanimity about theological beliefs.Baptists took pride in having \"no creed but theBible.\" The history of their ancestors' sufferingbecause of dissent from orthodox creeds is a constant reminder of the dangers of dogma inthe hands of powerful ecclesiastics co-optingpolitical power, or politicians eager to gain theadvantage of ecclesiastical support. Confessionsof faith have developed in order to express con-sensus views on doctrinal issues while allowingBaptists to fashion cooperative associationsbeyond doctrinal differences. 4 Anti-creedalism had its theological ground- ings in notions of soul competency, the priest-hood of the believer, and local church autono-my. Soul competency is the notion that each person is created in the image of God and thuscan discern the will of God for oneself with theguidance of Scripture, the inspiration of theHoly Spirit, and the shared wisdom of thechurch. Thepriesthood of the believer holds that each person of faith is directly related to andresponsible to God. 5The believer cannot substi- tute conformity to creeds, faithful obedience toclergy, or loyalty to government for the directand profound relationship to God that compris-es the life of faith. 6Ordination conveys the local congregation's endorsement and blessing ofthose called to ministry, but confers no special 2authority or privileges not otherwise controlled by the local church. Local church autonomy affirms that each church is independent of con-trol by any other agency or ecclesiastical entity.This emphasis is basic to Baptist polity. All authority for making decisions and setting poli-cy affecting its life, missions, and associationswith other groups is centered in the localchurch. The Convention is supported by churches cooperating in a voluntary effort to foster mis-sions, evangelism, and educational endeavors.The Convention itself is not a Church, but an organizational structure designed to assist localchurches in carrying out ministries beyond their immediate environs. No assessments of any kindmay be imposed by the Convention on the localchurch, nor may any doctrinal statements be imposed or required. Baptist beliefs regardingthe church emphasize the local congregation asa \"gathered community\" 7rather than a corpo- rate body. The \"universal church\" is composedof all believers but has no institutional expres-sion. Membership in the church is voluntary andpremised on one's conversion and baptism; it isnot conferred by tradition, ecclesiastical authori-ty, or family origins. BAPTISTS , EVANGELICALS , AND DIVERSITY Southern Baptists come from diverse roots. TheConvention is made up of Baptists who identifywith one or more of several traditions: (1) theliberal/religious liberty stance of Roger Williams,(2) the moral rigorism of New England Puri-tanism with its politics of theocratic governance(as in Puritan New England and Calvin's Gene-va), and (3) the influence of the church growthmovement out of California. Other strands ofinfluence include a high church tradition out ofSouth Carolina and frontier revivalism out ofNorth Carolina and Kentucky. Diversity may be asource of strength and vitality, but it is terriblythreatening to those who are convinced that cer-tain beliefs and attitudes are necessary to per-sonal salvation, or who cannot tolerate ambigui- ty. Baptists on both (all) sides of the diversitydebate claim commitments to the integrity of theChristian witness, but they mean very differentthings when they define what is required, per-mitted, or prohibited as a basic indicator ofChristian faith and what it means to be a Baptist. Debates over doctrine and the church's social mission have become a source of profound divi-sion among Southern Baptists. During the pastthree decades, a reform movement led by astutepolitical and religious leaders has impelled astrong shift toward conservative evangelical the-ology and ethics, that is, toward thePuritan/theocratic tradition. Their goal has been to narrow the parameters of theological beliefand moral perspective that might be foundamong those associated with the Southern con-vention. The leadership of the Convention increasingly identifies itself as \"evangelical\" instead of \"Bap-tist.\" Calling Baptists \"evangelical\" is problemat-ic. 8In general, \"evangelical\" refers to those Protestants who believe in biblical authority, a personal experience of salvation, evangelism,and congregational polity. Certainly Baptists fitthis description. But evangelicals make doctrinea central concern. Doctrines such as biblicalinerrancy, virgin birth, penal substitutionaryatonement, the bodily resurrection of Jesus, andthe bodily return of Jesus are thought necessaryto being a Christian. Evangelicalism is thus afirst cousin to Fundamentalism, which is strong-ly rationalistic and intolerant toward other views,even to the point of refusing to \"have fellow-ship\" with those who question doctrines such asthose just mentioned. 9 Historically, Baptists resisted the notion that they were Evangelicals. Since 1979, however, theterminology has become more widespread andreadily accepted among Southern Baptists, ashave an evangelical attitude toward the centrali-ty of orthodox belief and an intolerance towardthose who disagree on doctrinal or ethical mat-ters. SBC leaders have engaged in a concertedeffort to lessen the theological diversity among 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTER4 THESOUTHERN BAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSSouthern Baptists. Largely because of efforts to centralize authority and insistence on conformi-ty to conservative doctrinal views, the once uni-fied Convention has been fractured into a vari-ety of splinter groups. 10Some have broken away from the Convention and now claim no longer tobe Southern Baptists. 11Various forums and a considerable amount of literature provide alter-natives to SBC actions or perspectives onissues. 12 DIVISIONS , CHURCHPOLITY, AND FUTURE PROSPECTS The divisions within the Convention in recent years complicate the task of identifying the reli-gious beliefs of Southern Baptists with regard to health care. There is no definitive statement towhich one can turn and declare with confidencethat one knows what Baptists believe. (If such adeclaration could be made, it would hardly beBaptist, of course.) A further complication isthat SBC leaders now claim that a central orga-nizational authority, whether the ExecutiveCommittee or the President, can make definitivepronouncements on ethical or political issues forall Southern Baptists. Those formed by the tra-dition indebted to Roger Williams, GeorgeTruett, and E. Y. Mullins 13strongly resist such efforts on the basis of appeals to Baptist polityand freedom of conscience. Baptist polity builds upon the autonomy of the local church. The national convention cannotdictate practice or particular beliefs to individualchurches or their members. The Preamble to the 1963 Baptist Faith and Message (BF&M) state- ment acknowledged individual differences ofopinion and affirmed that confessional state-ments are not required of all Southern Baptists. 14 That acknowledgement was deleted from the BF&M revision of 2000. Further, the doctrinal portions of the 1963 BF&M were not to be used or circulated without the preamble, a provisionwhich was important in securing and maintain-ing wide support for the 1963 statement.But SBC leadership is now aggressively seek- ing to intervene in local church practices. Oneissue on which the leadership has succeeded, forall practical purposes, is homosexuality. Church-es that bless the union of openly gay or lesbianpersons, or ordain them as ministers or deacons,may no longer send messengers 15to the annual convention. Nor may they make contributions tothe Cooperative Program, the central fundingagency of the Convention. The issue of womenpastors has also been contentious, but womenhave been quite assertive in preventing SBCefforts to control their organizations and prerog-atives. The 2000 BF&M declares that \"the office of pastor is limited to men.\" 16Nevertheless, a few churches have women pastors, and the ordina- tion of women as ministers or deacons is wide-spread among Southern Baptists. The strategy of using convention resolutions as if conformity to them were required of allSouthern Baptists has met considerable resis-tance. Convention resolutions have traditionallyreflected the opinion of those messengers pres-ent and voting at the annual business meeting,and have not been binding on individuals, localchurches, or state conventions. The effort to press all state conventions to endorse the 2000BF&M has met with mixed results. Some state conventions have affirmed the statement (Mis-souri), others have refused to do so (Texas), andstill others have simply acknowledged it as oneoption among several (Kentucky). 17 A variety of relationships among the various state conventions, local churches, and thenational convention now exists. A very conserva-tive Southern Baptist church may relate directlyto the SBC, but not to its (moderate) state con-vention. Or state conventions may divide, as inVirginia, where strongly conservative churches split away and formed their own state conven-tion more in line with SBC directions and com-mitments. Another pattern is for a local churchto withdraw from the SBC and still cooperatewith a local association and/or its state conven-tion. Finally, the local church may affiliate withgroups or conventions in addition to the SBC.5 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERSome churches have maintained dual affiliation (as with the SBC and the ABC) for years. Freedom of conscience is a second source of resistance to any coerced uniformity of opinionamong Baptists. At the level of individual deci-sion making, traditional Baptist emphases onsoul competency and a personal relationship tothe living Lord have nurtured individualism inpersonal choices. Baptists are to be thinkingChristians who bear the burden of responsiblechoice, 18because they are directly accountable to God. The priesthood of the believer is thusunderscored and emphasized through freedomof conscience under the Lordship of Christ.Baptists think in terms of freedom, choice, andvoluntarism in faith decisions. 19It is one thing for the Convention to condemn abortion orphysician-assisted suicide, but it becomes quiteanother when Baptists confront a problem preg-nancy or an ugly, painful death, or simply reflecton the intellectual or biblical merits of the Con-vention statements themselves. Personal choicesmay be influenced more by health providers,friends, family, or respected ministers than bydenominational resolutions. POWER , LEADERSHIP , AND CONSENSUS In spite of resistance to centralized authority, Southern Baptist leadership is moving aggres-sively to assure basic conformity to its core man-dates, including, but not limited to, the 2000BF&M . The wider aim is to define orthodox belief and practice for all cooperating churches and/or their members. If the strategy of allowingonly one point of view to be taught succeeds,nearly all Southern Baptists should think alikewithin a single generation. 20The first group to feel the pressure to embrace the new directionare those directly associated with or employedby the Convention, who are now required toendorse the new Confession of Faith. Moreover,declaring oneself an \"evangelical\" (not a Bap-tist) is the first requirement for service onboards of trustees or other positions within theConvention. This strategy of selective appoint- ment dominates and gives strong direction tothe life and work of the Southern Baptist Con-vention. Furthermore, the presidents of the six semi- naries and leaders of other agencies insist on\"accountability\" measured by adherence to doc-trinal statements or convention resolutions. 21 Those who refuse to conform are forced out. Certain faculty at Southwestern Seminary, thelargest of the SBC schools, have chosen to resignor retire rather than sign the 2000 BF&M . 22 More recently, foreign missionaries have faced the \"sign it or leave\" dictum.23A strong reaction to this International Mission Board (IMB) actionhas resulted in the establishment of a fund inexcess of $1,000,000 to provide financial supportfor those missionaries who choose to leave theSBC-controlled Board. Still another controversy surrounded the effort by the North American Mission Board(NAMB) to control actions of the D.C. BaptistConvention (DCBC). The NAMB cut off fundingfor churches in the District when the executiveboard of the DCBC voted not to comply with SBC directives. 24At issue was whether the D.C. group was free to belong not only to the SBC but also to the ABC and the Progressive Nation-al Baptist Convention (NBC), both of whichhave more open attitudes on abortion, homosex-uality, and the ordination of women. 25The NAMB has also decided to discontinue commis-sioning women chaplains for the military. 26 The second new direction for SBC leadership concerns public policy. Evangelical/theocraticSouthern Baptists are vigorously pursuing theirmoral objectives through political and legislativeaction. They now form the core of what is calledthe \"Religious Right\" with its vision of a \"Chris-tian\" America. 27Efforts to influence congres- sional leaders seek to promote a conservativesocial agenda, from overturning Roe v. W ade to seeing that only conservative judges are appoint-ed. The claims of SBC leaders would havegreater political credibility if they could say \"Baptists believe\" and produce a statement that15 million Southern Baptists have endorsed. The discrepancy between historic Baptist understandings and faith commitments andthese efforts to reshape the Baptist witnessmakes controversy and resistance entirely pre-dictable. But insofar as the \"official\" or publicpronouncements of SBC leaders are concerned,diversity of opinion or extensive debate is simplynonexistent. The powers of intimidation andinstitutional authority, if not of persuasion, havesucceeded in muting if not eliminating voices ofdissent within the national convention itself.There is an amazing unanimity of opinion among convention leaders, at least according totheir writings and speeches. The net result is that, while Convention lead- ers interpret resolutions passed by messengers atthe annual meeting as both representative ofand required for Southern Baptists, large num-bers of Southern Baptists think and behave as if more traditional Baptist emphases on the priest-hood of believers, local church autonomy, pri-vate conscience, and religious liberty were stillnormative. This ironic state of affairs willundoubtedly persist for some time; there seemslittle prospect for a change in the direction ofthe SBC within the foreseeable future. This booklet therefore attempts to gather the declared or identifiable perspectives of currentleadership throughout the structures and ranksof the SBC, and thus to indicate sources of ten-sion and diverse perspectives that exist in thelarger body of Southern Baptists. It will draw onthe views of political activists, convention lead-ers, and current and former employees of con-vention agencies and seminaries to illustrateboth historical and contemporary variations in perspective on particular topics. 6 THESOUTHERN BAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSIn relating Southern Baptists' beliefs about the- ology and ethics to issues in health care, the key question is how beliefs about biblicalauthority, soul competency, the priesthood ofthe believer, freedom of conscience, localchurch autonomy, the universality of sin, and the leadership of the Holy Spirit affect decisionsabout these issues. Some studies have identified four primary elements in ethical decision making: (1) charac-ter, or one's defining values; (2) ethical princi-ples, or moral action guides; (3) theologicalbeliefs; and (4) perceptions of the nature of the problem and strategies toward its solution. 28The question is how these elements come together toshape the believer's decisions and actions in thehealthcare or clinical setting. Glenn Stassendeveloped a synergistic model showing the inter-action of four major variables: perceptions of thedata, ground-of-meaning beliefs, rules and prin-ciples, and interests and loyalties. 29 Needless to say, Baptist approaches to suchfactors or variables are strongly influenced by Scripture. Reference to the kind of person one ispoints to the virtues enjoined by the Bible; prin-ciples or rules can be drawn directly from Scrip-ture texts ranging from the Ten Commandmentsto the Sermon on the Mount; theological orground-of-meaning beliefs are shaped by bibli- cal teachings, stories, and parables; and one'sloyalties are directed to God as understood inthe biblical portrayal of Jesus Christ. Indeed, all writings by Baptists will emphasize Scripture and be strongly oriented toward thebiblical revelation. Some will appeal primarily toa type of proof-texting and others will be morecomplex in their style of interpretation andapplication. The great advantage of a modelsuch as that developed by Stassen is that it helpsone avoid an overly simplistic, proof-textingapproach. 30It appeals to those who rely primar- ily on a rational or thinking-through approach,both to the Bible and to specific decisions. James McClendon, on the other hand, is suspi-DECISION MAKING AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIP7 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERcious of what he calls \"decisionism,\" which he thinks relies too heavily on reason and rationalprocesses. 31He suggests a \"narrative\" approach to Scripture in which the believer identifies withthe stories of the people of God. He says thatthe stories of the Bible become the stories ofthe believer, and thus shape one's behavior intofaithful obedience. These and other Baptist theologians and ethi- cists engage the issues in a systematic and com-prehensive fashion by bringing historical per-spectives, biblical materials, and theologicalunderstandings together with clinical data andother information drawn from the world of sci-ence and medicine. Their approaches mayappear too complex for ready use by the Baptistin the pew or the parishioner facing a health-care crisis. Even so, almost any believer's deci-sions will reflect the elements identified bythese writers. Believers bring such factorstogether through imagination and intuition asthey make decisions in faith. In the healthcare setting, Baptists will draw on their reading of Scripture, the wisdom andstrength experienced through prayer, the sharedstories and specialized knowledge of physiciansand nurses, and the guidance of pastor and fam-ily. These areas come together as patients andcaregivers reflect on the interventions to be cho-sen among the identified alternatives, orpatients and families wonder whether to acceptany medical intervention at all. In the context ofshared suffering, a community of faith thatreflects or temporarily fills the role of thechurch in the believer's life may be formed. Baptists' decisions are by no means entirelyindividualistic, yet must finally be made by theone most affected: the one whose health, faith,and possibly life are uniquely at stake. Southern Baptists will be concerned that their decisions are \"biblical.\" Particular passagesof Scripture that are meaningful, or that seemdirectly to address the person in the situation athand, may be quoted or recalled. Citing IICorinthians 13:14, McLendon once wrote thatone's \"answer will refer ultimately to the love ofGod, to the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, [and] to the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.\" 32Reading a story in light of one's healthcare needs wouldlead to a \"this is that\" moment in which thebiblical passage becomes word of God for thebeliever. 33Discerning what ought to be done is a matter of the leadership of the Holy Spirit andthe wisdom of experience in community. 34When both patient and physician share similar reli- gious interests and commitments, their conver- sation will have common points of reference andwill genuinely reflect the role of community indecision making. Physicians nurtured among Southern Baptists will be personally concerned for patients andembrace generally accepted standards for pro-fessional medical ethics. They will go beyondprofessional standards, however, since they aremotivated by a Christian call to service and loveof neighbor. The story of the Good Samaritanhas inspired men and women to be sacrificialhealthcare providers and has led Baptists toestablish nonprofit hospitals, clinics, homes forthe elderly, and other facilities both at homeand abroad. For Baptists, beneficence in medi-cine will be understood in religious terms andtranslated into competent, compassionate care. Those providers influenced primarily by the tradition of moral rigorism (Puritanism/Funda-mentalism) may be strongly paternalistic. Somewill intervene or impose their personal point ofview in the name of preventing a patient frommaking a \"wrong\" decision or violating what isthought to be a biblical norm. Such physiciansmay strongly recommend treatments thought tobe in the patient's best interest, or even oppose and refuse to cooperate in certain options oralternatives, such as abortion, sterilization, orartificial insemination. Those committed morestrongly to the liberal/religious liberty traditionare likely to respect the patient as a responsibledecision maker before God and may offerinsight and counsel without seeking to imposetheir personal beliefs. The dynamics involved in patient-caregiver relationships are never purely formal, nor are8 THESOUTHERN BAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSthe decisions purely rational judgments. For Baptists, decisions, like relationships, are pri-marily personal. They reflect one's beliefs andvalues, which shape perceptions of God's willregarding issues such as illness and health, lifeand death, and one's responsibility to answerdirectly to God. Because the individual is creat-ed in the image of God and because Baptists seethe body as the temple of the Holy Spirit, theyplace a strong emphasis on health and wellness. Baptist notions of autonomy and religious lib- erty require respect for the other and emphasizethe responsibility to decide for oneself in light of one's faith commitments. Respect for personscan also enable physicians and other providersto relate positively to those of other religioustraditions in the belief that all people, whetherJewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, or atheist, are entitled to the protections and respect befittingpersons created in the image of God. From thisperspective, health choices reflect a life of faithbefore and with the God of one's religious tradi- tion, though the traditions may differ on particu-lar issues. The 2000 BF&M declares that \"God has ordained the family as the foundational institution of human society.\" Marriage isdefined by monogamy (\"one man and onewoman\") and permanency (\"a covenant commit-ment for a lifetime\"). Further, marriage is the\"framework for intimate companionship, thechannel of sexual expression according to bibli- cal standards, and the means for the procreationof the human race.\" 35 The dominant voice among Southern Baptists is also strongly opposed to gay and lesbianrights. The emphasis on the family presupposes a heterosexual union. Sexual activity by gays orlesbians is regarded as both unbiblical and rep-rehensible. 36Homosexuality is seen as a chosen lifestyle and thus condemned either as mentalderangement or moral depravity. Churches thataccept homosexuals as deacons or affirm theirunions are not allowed to participate in the con-vention. Southern Baptists are also deeply divided over women's rights and whether women are truly equals with men before God. Since 1986,resolutions approved at the annual Conventionhave declared that husband and wife are \"ofequal worth\" before God, since each is createdin God's image. Beyond that, however, theBF&M adopts a hierarchical structure that ele-vates male authority within family and church. The man is \"to love his wife as Christ loved the Church,\" but the wife is \"to submit herself gra-ciously\" to her husband. 37The inequality between men and women extends to the office of pastor, which is limited to men.38No South- ern Baptist seminary employs faculty who open-ly affirm that women may be called as pastors,nor is any woman a member of the departmentof theology at any SBC seminary. 39 CLINICAL I SSUES Abortion and the status of the fetus Polls indicate that most Southern Baptists take a moderate stance toward abortion.40That is, they identify neither with those who believe abortionshould be banned nor with those who believethere should be no legal controls at all. Nearlyall agree that there is a moral issue involved inelective abortion; they disagree over what publicpolicy is appropriate or necessary. Most believeabortion is best left to the woman or coupleinvolved, in a social context that allows aresponsible decision to be made without unduelegal hindrances. That position is based on theprinciple of the priesthood of the believer, thenotion that life begins with birth and breath,FAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATION9 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERand the absence of any prohibition of abortion in Scripture. For many, religious liberty commit-ments are also crucial for public policy protec-tions of the woman's right to decide. In theirview, reproductive freedom is an expressionboth of responsible sexuality before God and of the separation of church and state. Further,some would add, the fact that \"metaphysicalspeculation\" is necessary to arguments that afetus is a person underscores how deeply theFirst Amendment is involved on both Establish-ment and Free Exercise grounds. 41 During the 1970s, the annual convention sup- ported legislation that would have allowed ther-apeutic abortions while it rejected efforts to sup-port a constitutional ban. 42Those Southern Bap- tists who support abortion rights emphasize sal-vation by grace, the freedom of conscience, andthe responsibilities of faithful obedience as basicguides when dealing with matters so deeply per-sonal as abortion. W. A. Criswell, a biblical con-servative, supported Roe v. W ade both because it seemed consistent with Biblical views of person-hood that began with birth and breath (Gen.2:17), and because it protected the health andinterests of the woman. 43Numerous Southern Baptist professors, pastors, and other leaders,including almost all professors of Christianethics at SBC seminaries, also endorsed \"A Callto Commitment,\" circulated by the ReligiousCoalition for Reproductive Choice in 1977. The\"Call,\" among other things, asserted that humanmisery would increase if abortion were madeillegal, and that religious liberty and freedom ofconscience were at stake. Since 1986, however, SBC leaders have made a concerted effort to consolidate opinion againstany support for abortion rights in America. Theone exception allowed is abortion performed tosave the life of the woman. 44An absolutist posi- tion is now required in any public statement byany denominational employee or conventionleader, and an annual \"Sanctity of Life\" Sundayis promoted in SBC literature, with its stronganti-Roeagenda. The aforementioned support for \"A Call to Commitment\" became a majorfactor in criticism leveled by the SBC's right- wing leadership against those professors whoendorsed the statement. Some of the professorsrecanted or withdrew their signature under pres-sure from administrators and trustees. Noemployee of the Southern Baptist Conventionmay now publicly adopt a pro-choice position onpain of removal or other severe sanction. 45 A 1993 SBC resolution affirmed the sacred- ness of human life, deplored \"the killing of 1.6million unborn babies each year,\" criticized leg-islative efforts to curtail anti-abortion protests,and expressed strong opposition to the Freedomof Choice Act (which was referred to as the\"radical abortion on demand bill\") and anyeffort to include abortion funding in healthcarereform. 46More recent Southern Baptist Conven- tion resolutions condemn elective abortion as\"an act of violence against unborn humanbeings,\" and declare the Convention's \"endur- ing, consistent and vigorous opposition to elec-tive abortion.\" 47News reports from the Conven- tion-controlled Baptist Press (not the AssociatedBaptist Press), which are carried by the newspa-pers of all State Conventions, support only anti-abortion positions in their coverage. On this issue (and others of importance to the Religious Right), Baptists and other evangelicalshave joined forces with Roman Catholics. 48At a 1995 Christian Life Commission (CLC) confer-ence on \"Culture Wars,\" 49CLC executive direc- tor Richard Land described Southern Baptists as\"the most pro-life denomination in thecountry.\" 50Timothy George, dean of Beeson Divinity School in Birmingham, argued that\"the erosion of doctrinal substance\" in the SBCwas the reason Baptists had supported abortionrights during the l960s and 1970s. 51 Anti-abortion sentiment carries over into other facets of the reproductive choice debate.The drug mifepristone (RU-486) is considered a type of abortifacient, and its use is strongly con-demned. The convention went on record asopposing \"the testing, approval, distribution,marketing and usage . . . of any abortion pill andurging U.S. corporations which are considering10 THESOUTHERN BAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSsuch business ventures to refuse to do so.\"52 Not all Southern Baptists agree with the Con- vention's views on the moral gravity of abortionor how it should be treated in public policy. In apamphlet entitled Abortion and the Christian Life, the Christian Life Commission of the Bap- tist General Convention of Texas (hereafterreferred to as the Texas CLC) takes a moderateapproach to the debate. It adopts the idea of\"reverence for life\" (instead of sanctity ofhuman life) and applies it to the most vulnera-ble (the poor and minorities) in society, and to\"every life involved in a crisis pregnancy.\" TheTexas CLC would permit \"therapeutic abor- tions,\" and thus would allow the physical andemotional health of the woman, pregnanciesresulting from rape and incest, and fetal defor-mity to be considered in decisions about abor-tion. The pamphlet describes such terminationsas \"regrettable alternatives\" for the woman. 53 In a pamphlet commissioned by the Coopera- tive Baptist Fellowship (CBF), David Hughesargues that the terminology of \"sanctity ofhuman life\" is unbiblical, and that it is prefer-able to speak of a \"profound respect for humanlife.\" 54Ray Higgins argues in the same pamphlet that ethical decision making should focusrespect for persons on real and indisputablepeople, not on abstract ideas such as \"life\" or\"human life.\" The CLC approach, he contends,treats these abstractions as absolute values andapplies them primarily if not exclusively to fer-tilized ova and those who are dying. Higginswants ethics to embrace the moral value of thewoman, not just that of the fetus, and to encom-pass the problems of violence associated withcapital punishment and killing in war. 55 For their part, SBC leaders have strongly crit- icized those Baptists who take issue with themon abortion. Convention CLC staff authorsreferred to the Texas document as \"undefinedand permissive,\" 56and to the CBF pamphlet as \"painfully politically correct.\"57They further claimed that the idea of sanctity of human life isgrounded in the Reformation insight regarding sanctification. 58There is no way to know how many Southern Baptist women have abortions, since records donot indicate specific denominational affiliations.Clearly, abortion has been a chosen option forsome Baptist women. Some Baptists have alsobeen active in groups committed to and active for choice. 59They might cite the priesthood of the believer and freedom of conscience underthe lordship of Christ among their reasons fordoing so. On the issue of abortion, therefore, as with nearly every topic in health care, Baptists dis-play considerable difference of opinion. No one,and no single group, speaks for everyone. Formany Baptists, diversity is the practical meaningof the respect due to one another and is thelegitimate outworking of commitments to reli-gious liberty and freedom of conscience. In this perspective, each person must work out thedemands of faith in \"fear and trembling\" (Phil.2:12). Infertility and new reproductive technologies Varieties of perspective and approach also exist among Southern Baptists on the subject ofhuman infertility and the medical interventionsnow available to counteract it. No definitive con-vention consensus has emerged, nor has any res-olution on the subject been approved at a meet-ing of the national Convention. But there arepamphlets and other writings on the subject. Some statements label infertility interventions as \"artificial\" and \"unnatural,\" and thus ques-tion their ethical acceptability; other statementsexpress sensitivity to couples who struggle withthe frustration of this \"medical problem.\" Oneconference dealt with \"myths\" about how toachieve pregnancy and offered couples insightfulguidance that outlined the various interventionsavailable. Suggestions were also offered to churches developing ministries for couples who cope with this profound frustration. Speakerscalled for an expansion of traditional definitionsof family, and expressed sensitivity to the factthat a stress on mothers and fathers can bepainful for the childless. 6011 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERAt a and Spiritu- ality: Coping, Comforting, and Connecting,\"speakers were basically supportive of a variety ofmedical interventions. Apparently, however, theydid not address more controversial techniquessuch as artificial insemination by surrogacy. the speakers gaveencouragement to couples trying to achievepregnancy through sexual intercourse, but noencouragement to turn to interventions involv-ing biotechnical procedures. 61 Their approach illustrates the fact that, while Southern Baptists support the desire for chil-dren, many will not venture into the thickets ofmoral reasoning where biotechnical interven-tions are an issue. Such procedures involve themanipulation of gametes and pre-embryos 62in such a way that some of the latter are inevitablydestroyed or wasted. The process would there-fore seem to violate the principle of killing after\"the moment of fertilization.\" The same concernthat prompts assistance to infertile couplesprompts alarms about the moral status of thepre-embryo for those strongly committed to thenotion of the zygote as person. SBC materialsargue that compassion and guidance for livingwith the tragedy of infertility should be avail-able, but couples are never to consider optionsthat might prove immoral, such as abortion ordiscarding a pre-embryo. Even so, Baptist couples do resort to repro- ductive services in order to achieve pregnancy.Couples have used AID, IVF, hormonal treat-ments for both male and female infertility, andother approaches. 63At least ten different inter-ventions are now available to help a couple bypass the frustration of infertility. For thosewho believe that God has called them to be par-ents and who take seriously the responsibilitiesof love and nurture that Christians believeshould be part of family planning, there is noobvious ethical or theological reason not to useall the avenues that science makes available.Those choices can be based on Baptist doctrinal beliefs such as soul competency, the priesthood of each believer, and the guidance of the HolySpirit. 64 The Texas CLC has a pamphlet, Infertility and Medical Options , that openly explores sever- al of the technical procedures science nowmakes available to infertile couples. The docu-ment raises certain questions, such as whethergamete donors should be compensated, issuespertaining to the family and its genetic ties tothe offspring, the disposition of any unselected(cryopreserved) pre-embryos, the possible threatto the ego of a partner who is unable to share inthe genetic contribution, whether adoptionmight be a better option, and whether separat-ing love-making from conception is acceptable. 65 Basically, the pamphlet takes a positive butguarded approach that approves of such proce-dures, however tentatively. The pamphlet endswith an appeal to the concept of stewardship-stewardship of procreative powers, of marriage,and of parenthood-as the basic biblical-ethicalissue at stake. Further, the concepts of soulcompetency and liberty of conscience areimplicitly embraced. The moral issue is how various options affect those most intimatelyinvolved in the decision, namely, the prospectiveparents.12 THESOUTHERN BAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSThe Human Genome Project has raised a number of issues that require thoughtful reflection by Christians. Southern Baptists havecertainly given attention to questions posed bythe scientific possibilities associated with thenew genetics. They have shown particular inter-est in certain uses of this new knowledge, and avariety of responses can be found among them. CLINICAL I SSUES Genetic testing and screening Testing for particular genetic mutations is now available for a number of diseases that are relat- ed to the human genetic makeup. Genetic muta-tions can cause problems ranging from disfig-urement to lethal disease. Science can now testfor many markers for lethal genetic problems,but no corrective genetic therapy is yet available.Some problems can be managed by relativelysimple medical interventions, however. Forinstance, PKU is an enzyme deficiency that willcause radical mental retardation if it is not treat-ed. But it can be controlled by diet, and can bedetected at birth using a simple blood sampledrawn from the heel of the infant. Screening(testing) for PKU is now routine in hospitalsdespite the low incidence of its occurrenceamong newborns. Knowing the devastating con-sequences to those who are affected makes thevalue of testing seem well worth the price. Dia-betes can also be detected and treated with insulin, and those affected can lead rather nor-mal lives. No Baptist statement has been criticalof testing for PKU or diabetes. There are types of testing that clearly pose ethical issues, however. Markers can be detectedfor some diseases for which there are no treat-ments or cures. Some of these diseases will notbecome symptomatic until the person is an adult. SBC statements argue that all screeningfor genetic diseases for which there are no treat-ments should be prohibited. 66This prohibitionwould include diseases such as Tay-Sachs, from which a child will typically die by the age of twoand which especially affects Ashkenazi Jews, andadult-onset diseases such as Huntington's dis-ease or ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). In thesecases, terminating a pregnancy is now the onlyway to avoid the suffering and death that thedisease would eventually inflict. SBC oppositionto abortion thus has special meaning for Jews,who have used abortion as a way to reduce theincidence of Tay-Sachs in their offspring. Suchimplications highlight the importance of reli-gious liberty questions for public policy, and the wider significance of the ongoing debate onthese questions among Southern Baptists. 67 A Texas CLC pamphlet takes a more nuanced approach than the SBC statements. Pre-symptomatic testing should certainly be offeredif early detection would aid in treatments orimprove one's chances of survival. The pamphletadds that the possibility of discrimination ininsurance coverage or employment should alsobe addressed. An insurer's knowledge that one has a marker for adult-onset disease mayresult in a denial of health insurance coverage.Employers can use genetic information to deny a job or refuse a promotion. At the societal level,Christians are admonished to guard against ten-dencies to create a genetic underclass in Ameri-ca and against attitudes that would judge geneticdifferences/deficits ethically significant. Legisla-tion that prevents exorbitant costs for healthcarecoverage should also be supported. 68 Sex selection Genetic testing for sex-selection purposes is also condemned in SBC statements. Discarding apre-embryo or terminating a pregnancy becausethe conceptus is not of the gender desired by acouple is regarded as \"an affront to the sanctityof all human life and . . . a grotesque form ofgender discrimination.\" 69On this issue, Baptists are in strong but hardly unanimous agreement.A possible exception to the rule, for some, mightGENETICS13 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERbe cases in which a couple already have chil- dren of one gender and would like to have achild of the opposite gender in order to com- plete their family. Gene therapy The Texas CLC pamphlet acknowledges difficul- ties in making an emphatic distinction betweensomatic and germ line therapy. Somatic therapyis supposedly limited to treating the patient,whereas manipulations of germ cells (sperm andeggs) will transmit the changes to future genera-tions. If it is ethical to correct a problem for oneperson, the pamphlet asks, why not pass on thebenefits of that genetic correction to future gen- erations? The argument that consent cannot beobtained from future persons is a moot point.What can be done is to will and seek the health and well-being of future offspring, and perhapseven assure them of a genetic makeup free of aburdensome mutation. 70 Cloning Strong opposition to nuclear transfer cloning forreproductive purposes was expressed in a reso-lution at the 2000 annual SBC convention. Tworeasons were given: (1) cloning carries a signifi-cant risk of producing children with severe dis-abilities and lethal deformities, and (2) it substi-tutes biological manufacture of humans forhuman procreation. The biblical norm is held tobe \"procreation in which children are begotten, not made.\" The statement presumably intends adistinction between coital conception and fertil-ization produced in vitro. Asexual (noncoital)reproduction is thought to violate the biblicalnorm in which children are born to \"a husbandand wife.\" The resolution calls for Congress andworld leaders to enact a \"permanent, compre-hensive ban\" on human cloning and to imposesevere penalties for violations. 71 Experiments that can lead to cloning human beings are thus regarded as inherently wrong. The large number of embryos that would appar- ently be destroyed in efforts to create a clone isa major concern. Such procedures are comparedto the experiments conducted by Nazis on human subjects and are deemed a violation ofthe moral line-in-the-sand against rogue science.As an SBC spokesperson put it, such effortswould lead to \"a complete breakdown of thetotal system of medical ethics and of humanpersonhood.\" 72 While cloning poses special questions for ethics, not all Baptists agree that it should bebanned or is inherently evil. A previously men-tioned Texas CLC pamphlet does not addresscloning directly, but could encompass cloning inits guidelines for genetic research. 73Cloning human beings is an issue that will not go away,and many Baptists realize that the ethical issuesit raises deserve careful and continuing consid-eration. 74 Stem cell research Research with embryonic stem cells has beenaddressed by Southern Baptists in a variety offorums. At issue are \"pluripotent\" or early uni-versal cells with the potential to form almost anycell in the human body. That possibility makesscientists eager to see whether cures can bedeveloped for people now suffering because ofdamaged organs ranging from diseased livers tosevered spines. The focus is not on germ linecells that could produce an entire human beingbut on cells that might grow into replacementbody parts without the need for anti-rejection drugs. Stem cell research is thought by scientiststo be the most promising avenue for developingcures for diabetes, Parkinson's disease, car-diomyopathy, and hundreds of other maladies. The use of embryonic stem cells is made pos- sible by the existence of many pre-embryos thathave been cryopreserved and will apparently bediscarded. These pre-embryos have been pro-duced as a result of in vitro fertilization proce-dures for women facing infertility. Typically,more pre-embryos are produced than will beimplanted in the woman's uterus. If pregnancy isachieved, the couple may not wish to conceivefurther children. When there are \"extra\" pre-embryos, the couple may donate them to theSouthern Baptists give full support to trans- plants, whether from cadaver donors or liv- ing donors. Their strong belief in the resurrec-tion and the afterlife distinguishes the body ofearthly existence from the spiritual body suitedfor eternity. There is no need for a physical bodyin heaven, so believers can feel free to donatebody parts for transplantation. 78Attention is usu- ally given to cadaver organ and tissue donation,but Baptists would permit transplants from liv-ing donors as well as donation of the entirecorpse for medical research. Advances in anti-rejection interventions maketransplants increasingly effective and less sus- ceptible to rejection. Baptists recognize that adonated organ can thus be the gift of life to per-sons who are in need of a heart, lung, intestines,liver, corneas, skin, or various other body parts.Donating external parts of the body (hands,arms, legs, etc.) may pose certain aestheticissues for family members when viewing thecorpse. Many people are reluctant to donatesuch parts, though the ethical issues are littledifferent from those that arise when vital organsare involved. 79 The Texas CLC provides guidance for people 14 THESOUTHERN BAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSfertility clinic for possible adoption by other couples, donate them for experimentation, dis-card them, or pay to keep them in storage indef-initely. One experimental use, of course, involvesthe use of embryonic stem cells and poses ques-tions about the intrinsic value or personal statusof such genetic material. The SBC has gone on record condemning any federal funding for embryonic stem cellresearch. Such funding would reflect \"a crassutilitarian ethic that would sacrifice the lives ofthe few for the many.\" The SBC's concern isthat human embryos would be harmed, a devel-opment which would violate \"universally heldprinciples governing experiments on humansubjects.\" Research involving stem cells fromadults, \"which does not destroy humanembryos,\" is supported, however. The basic testis whether the research experiment will result inthe death of any embryo or whether it appearslikely to support abortion in any way. 75 Some Baptists disagree both with the Con- vention's use of absolutist language and with thecall for a ban on funding for any stem cellresearch. The Texas CLC cautions against a totalban, saying that each innovation should be eval-uated on its own merit, and that any decisionshould be informed, not reactionary. 76Other Baptists disagree with the SBC position on additional grounds. They argue that the basicquestion is whether a stem cell is \"human life\"that deserves protection as a \"human subject.\"The protection of human subjects in research and experimentation is the concern of interna-tionally recognized codes that govern the con-duct of scientific projects. No code of ethics, it isnoted, treats a pre-embryo as a person, that is,as a living, autonomous creature able to give orwithhold consent to experimental procedures. Moreover, to treat a pre-embryo as a person who should be given constitutional protectionsis questioned on biblical grounds. Some Baptistswould argue that the Bible does not treat fetus-es, much less pre-embryos or stem cells, as per-sons. Furthermore, the Bible insists that onlyGod is worthy of reverence. The pre-embryo should be treated with due regard without laps-ing into a posture of reverence toward it. In thisview, \"reverence for life\" should mean respectfor persons. To revere \"life\" or \"human life\" isto elevate the penultimate to the level of anabsolute. Science's moral mandate to pursueknowledge through research would includeresearch involving pre-embryos and stem cells,according to this approach. 77 ORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATION15 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERcontemplating organ donations. A brochure out- lines legal guidelines, procedures for declaringone's intention, and suggestions for discussionswith family (since family members make thefinal determination about cadaver donation,whatever the deceased person's declared wish-es). A biblically grounded frameworkcenters on the principles of \"reverence for life\"and \"stewardship.\" Organ donation is seen as anact of reverence for life. Stewardship gives direc-tion and meaning to the transplant technology,which both prolongs life and serves God's pur-poses. Donating organs can be a redemptiveaction in the face of tragic death. The brochureconcludes by suggesting support for people fac-ing transplant decisions through ministries thatinclude prayer, counseling, and assistance withcosts. 80 CLINICAL I SSUES Living donors Donations for transplants by living donors pre- sent an ethical problem that has not receivedsufficient attention. The deaths of donors ofliver (only a portion of the liver is used) or akidney have raised the issue with new serious-ness. It can be argued that Baptist notions ofsoul freedom and individual responsibility arenecessary but insufficient guides for makingdecisions about such donations. For one thing, aprospective donor can be free to accept the risksassociated with donating an organ only if he orshe has been adequately informed. Further,Baptists have not held that anyone is morallyrequired to sacrifice personal health, much lessone's life, for the sake of another, though theethic of sacrifice has been a strong motivation toparents or relatives. In recent years living donorshave died who either were not told of the signif-icant risks of infection and possible death from the procedures or chose to donate in spite of therisks. Is what is noble and sacrificial at one level almost reckless at another? Baptist pastoralcounselors, physicians, and theological ethicistswill need to give careful attention to the moraland emotional factors involved in these donordecisions. Sale of fetal tissue It is unlawful to buy or sell transplantableorgans and tissue in the United States. But thelaw allows payments for shipping and handling.(A single corpse can fetch up to $400,000,depending on how much of the body is usedand the various transportation costs in particularparts of the country.) The irony is that the onlymoney exchange that is forbidden is payment tothe donor or to the (deceased) donor's family.The intent of the law, of course, is to inhibit if not eliminate a traffic in body parts. The one market issue associated with organ and tissue recovery that Southern Baptists haveaddressed is the sale of fetal tissue. The Conven-tion's opposition to abortion generates strongobjections to selling parts harvested from fetusesfor use in research. The distinctive fear aboutthis practice is that it might encourage womento choose an abortion in the belief that somegood can come of it if donor tissue is recoveredfrom the abortus. A 2000 resolution named vari-ous companies involved in distributing fetalorgans and body parts. It was also argued thatfederal funding supports research using fetal tis-sue in several states. These transactions werecalled \"grisly practices\" that convert humanbody parts into a marketplace \"commodity.\" The sale of fetal tissue was decried as an assault \"on the biblical truth that all human beings arecreated in the image of God.\" 8116 THESOUTHERN BAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSSouthern Baptists have no objections to com- petent medical experimentation that involves human subjects who can provide informed con-sent. (Strong objections are expressed, however,to any research or experimentation involvingfetal tissue, as noted above.) 82Notions of soul competency and freedom of conscience, com-bined with an ethic of service and love for fellowhuman beings, often prompt volunteers to enterexperimental medical protocols. The volunteermay do so for the benefit of others, rather thanfor personal therapeutic benefit. 83As long as the protections required by law and medical ethicsare provided and careful attention is given toinformed consent, there is no moral reason toprohibit a person from entering a research study.Experimental devices, such as the artificial heart,will also need volunteer subjects if researchers areto discover whether the technology is sufficientlyadvanced for routine use with human patients. 84 CLINICAL I SSUES Genetic engineering and experimentation Genetic engineering is supported by Southern Baptists because it promises new avenues of ther-apy and new possibilities of cure. Now that genet-ic markers have been found for such dread dis-eases as cystic fibrosis, ALS, Huntington's disease,neurofibromatosis, retinoblastoma, certainleukemias, diabetes, and Wilm's tumor, such find-ings seem to promise new treatment approachesand cures for hundreds of lethal illnesses. TheSBC holds, therefore, that scientists should be encouraged in the battle against genetic illnesses. While the SBC supports genetic therapy, its materials also caution that \"we must be carefulnot to violate the sanctity of human life.\"Research that could support genetic enhance-ment is strongly resisted. The fear is that eugen-ics efforts like \"those in Nazi Germany\" mightsurface again with proposals for sterilization,abortion, or infanticide to prevent birth defectsor eliminate the genetically damaged. 85 Patenting new life forms produced by genetic engineering is also opposed when the patentinvolves mixing human genes with animal genes.Such research, declared Richard Land, is \"a par-ticularly egregious abuse of genetic technology,\"since the researchers violate the God-given limitsof nature and science. Each species should retainits own integrity: \"Animals and humans are pre-owned beings. We belong to God . . . [but] patents . . . represent the theownership rights of the Sovereign of the uni- verse.\" Further, \"transgenic experimentation\u2014introducing animal genetic material into humangenetic material\u2014devalues human life and, in ourview, represents a form of genetic bestiality.\"Thus, Land continued, \"[p]atenting human life 'commodifies' human tissues,and gene . . . That the U.S. Patent Office wouldgrant such applications is absolutely chilling.\" 86 Not all Baptists share such strong reserva- tions. Some would argue that the absolute dis-tinction between human and animal biology ishard to maintain. The difference lies in thecomplexity of the human genetic code, but somebasic gene sequences can be found in both plantand animal life. Further, some would add, it isdifficult, if not impossible, to show that theBible supports the notion of forbidden knowl-edge. Human sin and limitation may well distorthuman capacities for curiosity and innovation,but sin attends every human endeavor withoutrendering the venture itself sinful or forbidden.Some contend that to call the mixing of humanand animal tissue a form of \"bestiality\" is surelyan exaggeration, even a misuse of language forpolitical effect. If to own a patent on a life formis by definition to enslave it, is a life form orvirus designed to do a certain job (e.g., clean upoil spills) really a victim of enslavement? 87Clear- ly, this aspect of genetic research and engineer-ing represents another area in which Baptistsare not of one mind. MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND RESEARCHSouthern Baptists have made few formal statements regarding mental health. Discus- sions about healthcare reform have not been apriority for convention leaders, and thus thetopic has received little attention as a publicpolicy matter during annual conventions. At thepersonal and professional level, however, South-ern Baptists have contributed a great deal to thefield of mental health. SBC seminaries providetraining in pastoral care that combines theinsights of psychiatry with those of theologicaland biblical studies. Baptist chaplains serving inprisons, hospitals, and the military have broughtinsight and healing to persons facing mentalhealth crises. Jesus' miracles of healing and the biblical portrayal of God's concern for humanhealth and wholeness have provided inspirationand direction to such ministries. 88 The Wayne E. Oates Institute, located in Louisville, provides materials for ministersengaged in mental health services (and in otherhealth-related aspects of ministry). 89The Insti- tute offers monthly presentations and discus-sions, on-line conversations, an on-line journal,individual articles that can be downloaded, andother materials to ministers and laypersons whoseek assistance. 90 Baptists nurture a strong belief in the afterlife,and this belief affects decisions regarding aggressive treatment during the dying process.Some support is given for choosing to forgotreatment for lethal illnesses based upon thebelief that \"whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's\" (Rom. 14:8). Death is notseen as an ultimate enemy but as a transition toeternal life. CLINICAL I SSUES Forgoing life-sustaining treatment Withholding or withdrawing treatment from a dying patient is morally acceptable to mostSouthern Baptists. 91Their strong theology of the afterlife provides support for this approach insituations when death is imminent. The distinc-tion between \"allowing to die\" and intentionallyor willfully killing a patient is still vitally impor-tant. 92 The Supreme Court's decision in Cruzan (1990) included nutrition and hydration amongthose invasive treatments that might be refusedor withdrawn. Trustees of the CLC, however, directed staff to \"discourage any designation offood and/or water as 'extraordinary' medicalcare for some patients.\" 93Thus, providing nutri- tion and fluids by medical means was also to beviewed as \"compassionate and ordinary care.\"The trustee dictum left the CLC able to provide only limited guidance to Southern Baptists onvarious options for refusal of treatments. The same problem emerges in CLC guidance regarding living wills and advance directives.Without elaborating, the CLC says it \"supports living wills in most cases.\" 94But a CLC pamphlet on living wills never mentions the fact that thePatient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) of 1991 specifically includes the right to refuse even life-prolonging treatments. This information doesnot appear in the CLC pamphlet even though itwas published nearly three years after the PSDAbecame effective. Again, the declarations of SBC agencies are not binding on individual conscience. SouthernBaptists embrace a personal theology that stress-es the presence and power of God available tothe dying for comfort and consolation, as well as 17 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERMENTAL HEALTH DEATH AND DYINGfor wisdom, strength, and courage in dying. Death is the gift of God for the relief of suffer-ing and serves as a transition to eternal life. 95 Baptists also believe in and pray for miracles onbehalf of the sick and dying, but tend to have strong reservations about faith-healing rituals orevangelists who exploit hopes for a miracle.Notions of personal salvation and the divinepresence provide a religious frame of referencefor persons confronting death. One can die inpeace knowing that life everlasting in the pres-ence of God is assured. Beliefs in heaven and hell as the eternal habitations of the righteous and unrighteous,respectively, dominate Southern Baptistthought. 96Such religious beliefs serve as incen- tives to the life of morality and piety and providean orientation for life beyond death. SouthernBaptists have been inspired to sacrificial serviceby such beliefs, even to the point of martyr-dom. 97 Believing in the afterlife also serves to miti- gate efforts to prolong the dying process. Aggres-sive end-of-life measures may be seen as contra-dictory to the desirability of death under cir-cumstances of intractable pain and incurable ill-ness. Refusing treatment or withdrawing aggres-sive care would be acceptable on religious andmoral grounds. Quality-of-life considerationscan also figure prominently in Baptist patientpreferences. An accident or debilitating illnessmay leave a person so severely impaired thatdeath may seem preferable to living under suchconditions. Baptists recognize that personsmight well grow spiritually through suffering orduring the dying process. But few would suggestthat this possibility justifies imposing furthersuffering on the dying by using aggressive treat-ments. Suicide, assisted suicide, and active euthanasia Convention statements and literature draw the line at decisions intended to hasten or invitedeath. Suicide, physician assisted suicide, andeuthanasia are condemned as violations of thesanctity of human life. Suicide is often con- demned as a sign of weakened if not inadequatefaith. The distinction between \"allowing to die\"and intentionally or willfully killing the patientis therefore treated as vitally important. BecauseGod decides when death comes, all human efforts to alter the divine time frame are labeled\"playing God\" or condemned as unethical. God'sprovidence guides, if it does not determine, thecourse of the disease, whether and when one ishealed, and the moment of death. Euthanasia and assisted suicide are con- demned since \"they are direct, intentional actsof killing.\" 98Such practices are said to violate \"the biblical prohibition\" against the taking ofinnocent human life, whether by another personor by oneself. A resolution in 2001 condemnedthe Netherlands for legalizing active euthanasia,whether with or without the patient's consent.The practice of infanticide, even if the neonate is born with lethal deficits, was equally con-demned. Messengers expressed fear of a growing\"quality of life\" ethic as opposed to the sanctity-of-life ethic they embraced. Better pain manage-ment and keeping dying patients comfortablewere supported. 99 A CLC pamphlet calls upon governments at all levels to prosecute physicians or others whopractice euthanasia or assist patients to commitsuicide. 100The reason given is that there are suf- ficient pain management techniques to relievepain without the intentional killing of thepatient. Hospice is thus implicitly commended.The 2001 resolution affirms that \"every human life, including the life of the terminally ill, dis-abled or clinically depressed patient, is sacredand ought to be protected against unnecessaryharm.\" Legalized euthanasia is condemned as\"immoral ethically [sic], unnecessary medically and unconscionable socially.\" 101 Nonetheless, some Baptists believe that under certain conditions it is more humane and moralto help a patient die more quickly when thealternative is enduring a slow and ugly death.Further, it is reasonable to believe that there are and have been Southern Baptist physicians and 18 THESOUTHERN BAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSATTITUDES TOWARD DRUG AND AL COHOL ABUSE A Drug Task Force, composed of the leaders of the twelve SBC agencies, was established bySouthern Baptists in 1998. It reported to theannual convention in 2001. Targeting alcoholabuse and street drugs, as well as abuse of pre-scription drugs, the report charged that theabuse of drugs is \"ravaging our families.\"Churches were challenged to establish halfwayhouses for community ministry to the abuserand the addicted. 104Among Baptists, injurious habits related to drug abuse, nicotine, or alco-holic beverages are condemned on moralgrounds because of their adverse effects, both on health and on society: the body is a \"tem-ple of the Holy Spirit\" (I Cor. 6:19), and \"youare not your own; you were bought with a price\"(I Cor. 6:19-20; cf. 7:23). On the problem ofdrug abuse and addiction, Southern Baptists arein near-unanimous agreement. Additional insight into the meaning of Baptist beliefs about the freedom of conscience emergesfrom Baptist attitudes toward abusive habits. Southern Baptists believe strongly in free will,and this belief underscores personal responsibil-ity for one's actions. So strong is this convictionthat it can be difficult for Baptists to recognizethe implications of studies suggesting a geneticbasis for alcoholism. In ethics, \"ought impliescan,\" and this maxim points to the diminishedcapacity that people may have to control theiraddictive behavior. At the same time, an empha-sis on free will and individual responsibility isoften a source of hope and determination forthose struggling with substance abuse. With Godas helper, a support group for companionship,and the interventions of skilled therapists,unhealthy and indeed life-defeating patterns ofbehavior can be broken and positive, healthy patterns developed. The emphasis on personal responsibility also implies certain boundaries around the liberties ofconscience that Baptists claim so strongly. Theclassic text for Christian freedom is Galatians 5:1,which is an open declaration that freedom frombondage to the law is the gift of Christ. But Chris- 19 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERothers who have assisted persons to die.102 It can also be argued that, from a Baptist per- spective, suicide is not an unforgivable sin, espe-cially when a person is terminally ill. Even incases in which no terminal condition exists,many would concede that any \"moral failure\"involved in suicide is mitigated by depression ormental illness. Believing, as Baptists do, that sal-vation is by God's grace means that the finaldetermination of one's destiny is, in every case,up to God. A Texas CLC brochure recognizes the moral dilemma in end-of-life care. The writer counselsopen dialogue and constant care as persons facedeath. Euthanasia, understood as the activekilling of the comatose or unconscious, is notcondoned. 103The brochure says nothing, howev-er, about those who are in unremitting pain and request assistance. The moral and legal rule of \"double effect\" (or indirect effect), commonly associated withthe Roman Catholic tradition, allows the use ofmedication to alleviate pain even if death occursas an unintended result. Such an action is sup-portable on Baptist theological and ethicalgrounds, as well. The patient who sees death as a gift of God for the relief of suffering and as atransition to eternal life will not fear death somuch as dying an ugly death. Baptists will sup-port comfort measures, assure patients of thepresence of loved ones and caregivers, and praythat God's mercy will be experienced with agentle death. SPECIAL CONCERNS20 THESOUTHERN BAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONStian liberties are both defined and limited in certain ways. One is not free to do whatever one pleasesjust because the human spirit has been liberatedby the work of Christ. Rather, three freedoms aremade possible: one is enabled by grace to chooseappropriate behavior (1 Cor. 10:23); one is free tocontribute to the general well-being (1 Cor. 10:23b);and one is free not to be enslaved by legalistic reli-gion or injurious habits (I Cor. 6:12; 10:23). Baptists have thus been strong advocates of abstinence from alcoholic beverages. Some go sofar as to say that Jesus and the disciples drankonly grape juice, not wine. On the other hand,numerous Baptists work in distilleries, manydrink alcoholic beverages, and some churchesactually require wine for the Lord's Supper onthe basis of the New Testament pattern. Strongprohibitionist factions still exist within Baptistranks, however, and they can often keep a townor county \"dry\" in a local referendum. Even so, a larger proportion of Baptists tend to become abusers of alcohol than is the case, for example, among Jews, who use wine on a regularbasis. A major factor in the Baptist pattern may bethat the ostracism and judgmentalism directedtoward those who drink tend to drive them intoprivate spaces in order to hide the habit. Socialand religious disapproval creates guilt and shame,which, in turn, cause persons to drink in order toescape their problems or feel better about them-selves\u2014a sure formula for abusive behavior. 105 For those who have problems with drink or drugs, Baptists strongly advise therapeutic inter-ventions. Medicines are now available to facili-tate withdrawal and therapy is available to helpestablish new ways of thinking and acting. Alco-holics Anonymous and other assisting groupsare provided and supported by hospitals,churches, businesses, and government agencies. VIOLENCEAND SEXUALITY Southern Baptist responses to violence and sex- uality in the media and on the internet havereflected the national concern about outbreaksof violence among teens and in society generally. Fervent preaching often takes up moral issues, and issues associated with drugs, violence, andsexual exploitation are frequent targets for Bap-tist preachers. A resolution by the SBCaddressed \"a despair-soaked culture fixated ondeath replete with horrifically realistic andvicious computer games, new music genres suchas death metal and shock rock, and Internet websites with malignant content offering the meansfor the acting out of hate-filled behavior anddestruction.\" 106At issue is the extensive exposure of America's youth to violence through music,movies, television, videotapes, on-line interactivegames, and other media. According to the reso-lution, violence and sexuality pervade thenational consciousness and have a perniciouseffect on youth. Thus Baptists called for betterparenting, heightened attention to moral values,and stronger family commitments to nurtureyoung people. The entertainment industry waschallenged to \"exercise restraint\" in the \"depic- tion of violence, immoral sexual conduct, [and]the use of offensive language and lyrics,\" and tocreate products that are \"morally wholesome.\" Southern Baptists also make available materi- als for sex education of various age groups, frompre-school children through young adults. 107The first educational series was launched in 1973. Arevised series, launched in 1993, advocates amuch more conservative posture than priorbooks. For example, no mention is made either of homosexuality or of abortion in the book current-ly used with early teens. \"True Love Waits\" is a religious and educa- tional campaign that aims to persuade teens tocommit themselves explicitly to abstinence priorto marriage. A variety of videotapes, books, andmanuals, along with a pledge sheet, are availableas part of the campaign. 108So strong is the SBC's commitment to sexual abstinence as the onlypossible approach to unmarried sexuality thatthe executive director of the Ethics and Reli-gious Liberty Commission (ERLC) publicly criti- cized the U.S. Secretary of State for suggestingthat sexually active teens should use condoms. 109HIV/AIDS Southern Baptist attitudes toward and approach- es to HIV/AIDS have typically been linked tobeliefs about homosexuality, which is regarded as a \"perverted lifestyle.\" 110The AIDS epidemic has been viewed as the judgment of God,111and it has been claimed that \"toleration\" of homo-sexuality (as well as abortion) leads to God'spunishment of a nation. 112A 1987 resolution viewed AIDS as \"a major health threat\" result-ing from a rejection of \"biblical standards ofdecency and morality.\" Opposition to the distri-bution of condoms and the notion of \"safe sex\"was expressed. Still another resolution viewedhomosexuality as the cause of AIDS, linked suf-fering to God's punishment, and called on gaysto seek forgiveness for their \"abomination.\" 113 The Bible is said to teach that homosexuality is an abomination to God114on the basis of such passages as Genesis 19:1-5, Leviticus 18-22, andLeviticus 20:13 (which calls for the capital pun-ishment of males engaged in homosexual activi-ty). A 1992 recommendation from the ExecutiveCommittee of the SBC condemned two churchesfor \"accommodating homosexuality\" and calledfor their exclusion from the SBC. One hadblessed the union of a gay couple and the otherhad ordained an openly gay man as a deacon. 115 Convention resolutions express \"abhorrence ofhomosexuality\" because \"God regards homosex-uality as a gross perversion unquestionedsin\" and \"unrepentant homosexuality is repeat-edly condemned in Scripture.\" 116 SBC literature has tended to dwell on certain fears associated with AIDS. The CLC, forinstance, expressed a fear that the AIDS epi-demic would be so costly as to \"force the coun-try to adopt active euthanasia out of economicnecessity.\" 117 Even so, an ethic of \"Christlike compassion\" for the \"victims of AIDS and their families\"118 informs the responses of most Baptists. Openacceptance of homosexuality is not often found, but nearly all Baptists advocate a caring ministryto those with AIDS. Educational material isavailable to facilitate discussions by study groups in local churches and calls are made for ministryto those who are homosexual. 119 Southern Baptist churches have begun to rec- ognize the inevitable presence of persons livingwith AIDS (PLWAs) in both church and socie-ty. 120Because AIDS is a disease that affects actu- al human beings, a highly personal theology andethical orientation has led many Baptists toengage in caring ministries for people regardlessof their circumstances. A number of effectiveministries, such as the Baptist AIDS Partnershipof North Carolina, have been developed. Otherministries have been instituted in Houston, SanFrancisco, and Knoxville. 121 Educational materials have also been created to assist concerned individuals and churches indeveloping ministries and countering fears andprejudices that often accompany encounterswith PLWAs. A resource and study guide pub-lished by the Cooperative Baptist Fellowshipsuggests that moral judgment be suspended inthe interest of truthful understandings and com-passionate ministries. It aims to provide accurateinformation about HIV/AIDS, dispel myths,diminish fears based on false rumor, encouragechurches to be open to PLWAs, deal with ethical issues emerging in the AIDS crisis, and provideministries to families dealing with grief andother issues. 122 The tragic story of a prominent Southern Baptist minister's family and its struggle withAIDS brought national attention to their experi-ence. It has proven to be a case study in howbiblical-theological beliefs and traditionalapproaches to homosexuality influence attitudestoward those living with AIDS. The ministernow works with the AIDS Interfaith Networkand served for three years on the President'sCommission on AIDS. 123 21 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERSPECIAL NEEDS , CREATIVE MINIST RIES Effective responses to healthcare needs often emerge in creative ways among Southern Bap-tists through individual and church ministries.These ministries are part of a movement empha- sizing the relation of faith to health care thatseems to be gaining recognition and momentumthroughout the country. A foot care clinic, headed by a retired nurse who recognized the need for such care amongdiabetic patients, has opened at a church in FortSmith, Arkansas. The ministry serves olderadults who find it difficult to care for their feetand toes because of physical limitations. Theservice combines the biblical story of Jesus'washing the disciples' feet with meeting thehealth needs of this particular population. 124Parish nurses and congregational health min- istries often connect area churches with a hospi-tal, thus making these ministries a source ofecumenical cooperation as well as resources forpeople with health-related needs. 125Support groups for home and family caregivers are also gaining recognition for the vital ministry theyprovide. Further, there is an emerging recogni-tion that caregiving professionals\u2014pastors, physi-cians, nurses, social workers, and otherproviders\u2014are also among those who need sup-port groups. These groups provide resources forthe family or professional, relationships withother caregivers, assistance in dealing with fearsand myths, and counsel on how to work throughcomplex decisions. 126 22 THESOUTHERN BAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS1. At least two other views of their origins can be found among Baptists. Some claim that Baptists descendedfrom 16 thcentury Anabaptists centered in Westphalia, Germany. But the General Baptist Confessions of 1611 and 1666 and the Particular Baptist Confession of1644 rejected any association with Anabaptists. Oth-ers, called Landmark Baptists, claim an unbroken suc-cession through various dissenters, whom they traceall the way back to John the Baptist. This claim hasbeen thoroughly refuted. An occasional similarity of views is hardly sufficient to establish organic connec-tions with those claimed as ancestors. See W. M. Pat-terson, Baptist Successionism: A Critical View (Valley Forge: Judson Press, 1969); B. Hays and J. Steely, The Baptist W ay of Life (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice- Hall, 1963); and P. A.

The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship (CBF), Atlanta; Mainstream Baptists, Norman, Okla.; and the BaptistGeneral Convention of Texas, Dallas, have distanced themselves without openly separating from the SBC. 11.

The CBF supports the work of the Baptist Center for Ethics in Nashville (on the web at: baptist4ethics.com);the Baptist General Convention of Texas has its ownChristian Life Commission, which produces materialson various issues and conducts conferences; Main-stream Baptists also produce and distribute pamphletsthat challenge materials from the SBC (on the web at:mainstreambaptists.org). 13.

Southern Baptists distinguish \"messengers\" from \"del- egates.\" The local church appoints a \"messenger\" butcannot dictate how the messenger is to vote at theannual convention. Further, the \"convention\" is not achurch or ecclesiastical body, as such. It is an annual gathering of messengers from local churches for thepurpose of conducting business and encouraging oneanother in missions and evangelism. 16.

McClendon, Jr., Ethics , vol. 1 of Systematic Theol- ogy(Nashville: Abingdon, 1986). Despite his criticism of an excessive reliance on reason, McLendon identi-fies three \"spheres\" or strands basic to Christianthought: the organic , which takes account of bodily needs, and for which love is the central norm; the com- munal , which deals with life in society and the assis- tance the church can provide for ethical living; and theanastatic , which accounts for resurrection and the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer.McClendon's focus is on peacemaking and nonvio-lence, and he does not address healthcare issues. Hisapproach thus has limited value for medical or clinicalethics, but an attempt to devise a decision-makingmodel based on his three spheres could be intriguing.See also A. Jonsen, M. Siegler, and W.

A Southern Baptistpastor and his wife have written a moving book on theirstruggle with infertility (A. Trent and P. Trent, Barren Couples, Broken Hearts: A Compassionate Look atInfertility [San Bernardino, Calif.: Here's Life ers, 1991]). They discovered that there were no storiesof permanent infertility in the Bible, and for them thislack was discouraging and upsetting. (The biblical nar-ratives of Abraham and Sarah [Gen. 16-21] and Elka-nah and Hannah [I Sam. 1-2], for example, both endwith the birth of a child.) The authors offer a sensitiveand insightful approach to a profoundly personal andtroubling issue. One of the strengths of the book is thatthe writers share the problem with hopeful readers;they are not armchair theologians or counselors who donot know the agony of childlessness and/or infertility. 61.

The pamphlet con- cludes with four guidelines based generally on biblicalvirtues. Gratitude to God for the good gifts of the healing arts and scientific inquiry requires good stew-ardship of those powers. Compassion and justice require us to relieve suffering and create a society inwhich the benefits of medical science will bless theentire community, and not be used primarily for aprivileged few. Humility requires patience and leads us to proceed with caution into the uncharted waters ofinnovative science; new techniques raise new ques-tions and problems. Finally, courage and imagination require a positive attitude toward scientific discovery,yet with a sense of its contingency. The promise of thefuture should generate excitement about the possibili-ty of new cures, but should also remind us of the dan-gers associated with enthusiasm without wisdom. 71.

D. Simmons, \"To Clone or Not to Clone?\" Christian Ethics Today 3, no. 3 (July 1997): 10-14. Several fac- tors associated with cloning are worth noting in thiscontext. One is that \"cloning\" takes place in naturewhen twins or multiple siblings are the result of divi-sions of the fertilized ovum. Twins have the sameDNA, much as a clone would have the same DNA as the person being cloned. Can it be inherently wrong toimitate a process that occurs routinely in nature itself?Second, children produced by biotechnical means arestill persons in every sense. To categorize such chil-dren as \"artificial\" or \"manufactured\" seems, howeverunintentionally, to depersonalize and dehumanizethem. Third, each cloned person would be an individ-ual in his or her own right, not someone else\u2014noteven the \"parent\" from whom he or she is cloned. Wemay duplicate genetic information, but not the historyor pattern of experiences that make each personunique. He or she would still be created in the imageof God and would be an object of the divine love and care. Finally, science does not yet know all the bene-fits that cloning techniques might bring to humanhealth. To ban such research might be to deprive thefuture of substantial benefits. 75. \"On Human Embryonic and Stem Cell Research,\" Resolution 7, 1999 Annual , 96. 76.Baptist General Convention of Texas Christian Life Commission, Genetic Research . 77.J.

Increasingly,healthcare workers face the challenge of provid-ing appropriate care and services to people of dif-ferent religious backgrounds. Unfortunately,many healthcare workers are unfamiliar with thereligious beliefs and moral positions of traditionsother than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practi-cal information about the values and beliefs ofdifferent religious traditions. It should assistnurses, physicians, chaplains, social workers, andadministrators in their decision making and caregiving. It can also serve as a reference for believ- ers who desire to learn more about their own tra-ditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the his- tory of the tradition, including its perspectives onhealth and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Final-ly, each booklet offers information on specialconcerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated by authorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral deci-sions about clinical issues to individualconscience. We would therefore caution the read-er against generalizing too readily. The guidelines in these booklets should notsubstitute for discussion of patients' own reli- gious views on clinical issues. Rather, they should be used to supplement information com-ing directly from patients and families, and usedas a primary source only when such firsthandinformation is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practi- tioners see that religious backgrounds and beliefsplay a part in the way patients deal with pain, ill-ness, and the decisions that arise in the course oftreatment. Greater understanding of religious tra-ditions on the part of care providers, we believe,will increase the quality of care received by thepatient.
