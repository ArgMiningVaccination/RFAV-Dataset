Integrative medicine is the main form of alternative treatment in the field of infertility. It focuses on the optimal health and healing of a patient, taking into account the entire person instead of simply treating her immediate condition with drugs or surgery. In other words, integrative medicine takes a holistic look at healing a patient's mind, body and soul - not just a specific ailment. When it comes to infertility, treating patients' entire well-being instead of targeting a certain condition can be very effective because patients often have more than one factor contributing to their infertility.
