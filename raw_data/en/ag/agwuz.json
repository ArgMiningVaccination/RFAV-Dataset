SIatf Writer Despite a marked increase over the IllDlber of city parking tickets issued !be preceding week, Iowa City Police Chief Harvey Miller said Tuesday that !be fU'St week of the UI fall semester is nol open season on student pa rking violators. \"We bave the same level of enforce\u00ad ment as we always do,\" Miller said in response to the 50 percent jump in tickets Issued last week. \"It appears like we are g1vllll out more tickets because of the increased influx of cars (during the first week of school). But no -there's no crackdown .\" WHILE the increased number of tickets is not solely the result of the ex\u00ad panded student population, City Treasurer Nancy Heaton -in charge of city parking revenues -said she has come to expect the increase at the beginning of each school year. \"It's rea\\1y a matter of im\u00ad maturity,\" Heaton said. \"A lot of stu\u00ad dents think they're doing the city a favor by comilll to Iowa City, but when you consider that a student spends money downtown maybe one, two days a week, they're really not putting In enough to keep the merchants going.\" Heaton explained that, because it is vital to downtown merchants that Student newspaper editor jailed there be a steady turnover of trafIic, short-term meters with one and two\u00ad hour limits dominate the area. It is the downtown parking spaces, Heaton said, that generate the most traffic revenue.

Stall Writer Republican candida tes In Johnson County, in an effort to break the Democratic strangle hold on county of\u00ad fices, will receive $12,000 in campaign aid (rom their party, while Democratic candidates will receive 1 none from theirs. The Johnson County GOP Central Committee in July reported it had on hand $15,1Y73.71 compared to $1,863.31 t for the county's Democratic Party. Of the Republican money, $12,000 will go to its county and state legislature can\u00ad didates, while the Democratic stan\u00ad dard bearers may have to rely on their own money-raising efforts and the party's voter registration program. Jeff Cox, chairman of the Johnson County Democratic Party, said the Republican money will mean GOP can\u00ad didates will have a lot of advertising . \"This is just routine,\" Cox said. \"The Republicans are rich. They're rolling in money -what can I say? We don't have any.\" THE REPUBLICAN funds are being distributed by the pa rty central com\u00ad mittee in three allocations. The first round already awarded the largest amount of money to the candidates the party feels will fare best in November. Incumbant Sheriff Gary Hughes, candidate for auditor Cathy Finley, supervisor candidate and incumbant City Councilor Robert Vevera, super\u00b7 visor candidates Audrey Jordahl candidate Mary Conklin and 73rd Dis\u00ad trict state representative candidate Howard Sokol each will receive $2SO as a result of the party's first round of funding. The next round, to be approved by the party's central committee in a few weeks, would allocate $5.000 to the 15 candidates for state and local offices. A third round of funding totaling $2,500 will be voted on during October. ADDITIONAL funding may be available to candidates from the Republican Women, which has raised $1,902, as of July. The party decides which candidates will get the most money based upon the See Fln.ne .. , page 10 hour class before receiving a ticket. Heaton also said, while the $2 fine for a meter violation seems inordinately high when compared with the 50 cents charged in Ames and Cedar Falls, the charge is fair when one considers the graduated fine schemes those cities employ. The 5O-cent fine, Heaton said, is ap\u00ad plicable only when payed within 24 hours after the citation is issued. After the first day, she added, the fine is raised to $3 in Cedar Falls and, after seven days, the fine is raised to t6 in Ames. Heaton said because a graduated fine scale is expensive to maintain and more open to disputation \"a person may claim he mailed the fine in before it went up and the city may say he didn't.\" Iowa City maintains a fixed fine for meter violations. But, Heaton added, if a person ac\u00ad See Pnlng, page 10 Carter fires bitter reply at Reagan INDEPENDENCE , Mo. (UPI) - President Carter accused Ronald Reagan Tuesday of dividing the coun\u00b7 try by trying to link him to the Ku Klux Klan, and called Reagan's nuclear policy a threat to the nation's security and world safety. Republican presidential nominee Reagan raised the Ire of both Carter and Alabama politicians by criticizing Carter for opening his campaign in Tuscumbia , Ala., which Reagan called \"the city that gave birth\" to the Klan. Carter, campaigning Tuesday in Kansas City, Mo., bitterly denounced Reagan's Labor Day comments as un\u00ad called for, inaccurate and a slur on the South. Rep. Ronnie Flippo. D-Ala., noting that Reagan was geographically about 50 miles ofl the mark, demanded an apology. Flippo called It a \"scurrilous statement\" and an \"Insult to the peo\u00ad ple of North Alabama.\" ALABAMA GOV. Forrest H. James, a Democrat who has not yet endorsed Carter. also demanded an apology from Reagan. \"Not only is this statement erroneous but it also demeans the memory of a great Alabamian who is beloved by millions the world over, Helen Keller,\" James said. \"The city of Tuscumbia is the birthplace of this great lady. something of which its resi\u00ad dents and all Alabamians are justly proud. \" Sharply escalating his criticism of Reagan and calling him by name for the first time in the faU campaign, Carter said every president since Harry Truman was committed to con\u00ad trolling nuclear weapons and in not launching a nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union. \"Ronald' Reagan Is the first one to depart from that commitment, \" Car\u00ad ter said. \"He has announced that if he is elected, he will initiate a massive nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union. That would mean that if he did that, there would be no reason for the United States and the Soviet Union to try to negotiate an arms control treaty.\" \"I consider this one of the most serious threats to the safety and security and peace of our nation and the world as being dramatized in this election,\" Carter said. THE PRESIDENT'S voice shook when he responded to reporters' ques\u00ad tions about Reagan's remark Monday noting that Carter bad chosen to open his campaign in \"the city that gave birth to, and is the parent body of the Ku Klux Klan.\" \"Anybody who resorts to slurs and to Innuendos against a whole region of the country based on a false statement and a false premise, is not doing the South or our nation a good service,\" Carter said. \"This is-not the time for a candidate trying to get some political advantage to try to divide one region of the coun\u00ad try from another by alleging that the Ku Klux Klan Is representative of the south or Tuscumbia , Alabama. \"I think it was uncalled for, I think it was inaccurate and it was something that all Southerners will resent. As an American and a Southerner, I resent it,\" he said. \"Reagan is different from me in almost every basic element of commit\u00ad ment and experience and promise to the American people. 1 believe in peace. I believe in arms control, I believe in controlling nuclear weapons, I believe in the rights of working pe0- ple in this country, I believe in looking forward and not backward. I don't believe the nation ought to be divided one region from another,\" Carter said. THE KU KLUX Klan was actually started in Pulaski, Tenn., as a social club on Christmas Eve, 1865. But Klansmen in their white robes and pointed hats soon were trying to frighten blacks by pretending to be ghosts of Confederate dead. Reagan later telephoned James with an apology. saying he did not mean for his \"off-the-cuff\" remarks to be taken as derogatory , and James accepted it. VP candidates to visit Iowa ... ...

Both Republican and Democratic state campaign leaders said the pop\u00ad ularity of Bush and Mondale in Iowa, along with limits on campaigning time and the fact that Iowa repre\u00ad sents only eight electoral votes, are reasons the vice presidential can\u00ad didates (or their relatives) will act as surrogates.

Staff Writer The Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity's press release calls the sale of the items a \"philanthropy project.\" ill Head Football Coach Haden Fry thinks the items may add a little piz\u00ad zazz to his recruiting efforts, so last year he bought more of them than anyone elJe -500 to be exact. The Items, which will ,0 on sale Sept. 5, are c.lendars that include an l!ltenslve IIsltlng 01 UI events, and, for aood measure, pictures of \"lS very complete women from the university sororities,\" according to the frater\u00ad nlty'l presa releue. For 18 years, the Kappa Sigmas have been using pictures of sorority girls - each striking a somewhat reserved yet provocative pose -on the calendars to help sell the items. PROFITS (rom the calendars, which cost $2 each, will go to Mercy Hospital to help purchase equipment that measures children's blood pressure, said fraternity President Mark Roggenkamp. The fraternity last year raised $1,200 for Mercy Hospital's Special\u00b7 Equip\u00ad ment Fund. This year, the fraternity hopes to raise $1,500. Roggenkamp said. Fry ..

Last year's calendars did not have a theme, but Fry $aid the calendars' background scenes typified the UI campus. This year, the motif for the calen\u00ad dars is sports. Liz Isham, president of the UI Women's Panhellenic Association, said the sports theme translates Into the women wearing 'swimsuits, no doubt.\" But ROllenkamp said, \"We're not trying to exploit the Ilrls In any way.\" He added that by concentrating on a \"sports oriented theme,\" the calen\u00ad dars will be marketable not only to stu\u00ad dents, but to the entire Iowa City populace. THE PROCESS of selecting the women who eventually appear on the calendars takes about a week, Roggenkamp said. The selection process begins, he said, after each of the Ul's 13 sororities chooses two represen\u00ad tatives. The \"YOmen then attend a series of get-togethers, like \"wine and cheese parties,\" with the Phi Kappa Sllma fraternity members, Roggenkamp said. At these parties, the field Is narrowed. The women are judged on their at\u00ad tractiveness , outstanding per8Oll8lity and the ability to represent their respective sororities, he said. Isham said that some of the girls who pose for the pictures are honored to be chosen. \"I think it's a status symbol in some ways,\" she said. \"Girls like to be admired.\" But Isham, commenting on the press release's description of women\" said \"I don't like that.\" it w~man for women,\" she said, \"we should be mature.\" BOriefly Court bans teachers from blocking doors UPI -The Philadelphia School District won a court injunction Tuesday to stop striking teachers from blocking entrances to district headquarters, where pickets jeered and shoved officials who tried to cross their lines. Philadelphia was the biggest of a rash of strikes across the nation that could extend summer vacation for thousands of youngsters . The main issues in what has become an an\u00ad nual September rite in recession-pinched school districts were higher salaries, cost of living increases, limitations on class size and more teacher preparation time. Philadelphia's 20,000 teachers struck Tues\u00ad day in demands for higher salaries and the rehiring of 2,000 teachers laid off in an economy move. School was scheduled to open Friday for the city's 220,000 students. In Dubuque, striking members of the Dubu\u00ad que Theological Seminary faculty, who had picketed with such slogans as \"take this job and sanctify it,\" agreed to resume bargaining and to stop picketing at least temporarily . Man gets sentence . for raping his wife REDDING, Calif. (UPI) -A judge senten\u00b7 ced Hughlen \"Cliff\" Watkins Tuesday to 240 days in the Shasta County Jail for raping his wife. Watkins, 24, pleaded guilty to breaking the state's new spousal rape law, which went into effect on Jan. I under Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s signature. The maximum sentence for misdemeanor spousal rape is one year in county jail. Superior Court Judge Joseph Redmon also placed Watkins on three years probation. In March, Watkins' wife, Catherine, 23, told police that her husband choked her and forced her to have sex. She said he told her to \"call the cops if you want,\" then dropped of( to sleep. \"I filed for divorce the same day I called the police to report my husband had raped me,\" she told an interviewer last month. \"I would have done it sooner, but Cliff convinced me that I had no choice but to stay with him. He kept telling me that no other man would want a woman who has three kids.\" Watkins said he changed his plea from inno\u00ad cent to guilty \"because I didn't want my kids to have to go through it. And after thinking it over, I decided it could be called 'rape,' if it's possible to rape your own wife.\" In June, judges in separate cases in Liver\u00ad more and Hayward sentenced two men for spousal rape -the first penalties believed to be handed down under the new law. Maine coast closed , to shellflshlng ..J AUGUSTA , Maine (UPI) -Testing of clams for paralytic shellfish poison began Tuesday as clam diggers and dealers accepted with resignation the bruising economic effect of closing the 3,500-mile Maine coast to shellfishing because of a \"red tide\" invasion. The state's coastline was closed Monday to harvesting of filter feeding shellfish when 16 people in Maine and Massachusetts were hospitalized for paralytic shellfish poisoning caused by the\" red tide,\" a form of seaweed that invades and contaminates marine mollusks, giving sea water a reddish tinge. The contaminated clams eaten by the vic\u00ad tims were believed to have come from Maine. The Marine Resources Department said the ban included filter feeding shellfish such as clams, quahogs and mussels. Scallops, lobsters,. crabs and finfish, unaffected by the parisite which causes the disease, remain fair game. The Marine Sciences Bureau began testing shellfish samples from dealers and retail out\u00b7 let up and down the Maine coast. John W. Hurst Jr., resource services direc\u00b7 tor at the state fisheries research laboratory in Boothbay Harbor, said he might be unable to pinpoint the origin of the contaminated clams even after extensive testing. \"They came from a Maine shipper,\" Hurst said. \"Where he got them I have no way of knowing. I have to take his word for where the clams came from and he mayor may not know.\" Quoted .. h's very hard to look at a tailplp~ and figure out what the owner of a car had In mind when he parked it. -Iowa City Police Chief Harvey Miller dis\u00b7 CUSSing the ticketing of parked cars.

In a report to the Johnson County Boa rd of Super\u00ad visors at their informal session Tuesday Slockett also said an additionaL $100,000 in anticipated aid for Johnson County school districts and ci ty govern\u00ad ments will be cut. And he added that the state com\u00b7 ptroller's office has indicated that Ray's Aug. 12 or\u00ad der for across-the-board cuts totaling $61 million may not be tbe final reduction in the state's aid to local governments . \"IF THE economy gets better he (Ray) may withdraw the order, or if the economy gets worse he may issue another executive order resulting in further cuts,\" Siockett said. \"I think we are paying the consequences of the state's tax rebate,\" he said referring to a property tax cut enacted last year.\"We cut taxes because the state said it would reimburse us, but now they are saying they can't pay us.\" Board Chairman Harold Donnelly said he an\u00ad ticipated even greater cuts. \"I thought it would be more than $40,000.

Hawkeye CableVision General Manager Bill Blough said cable service to the county residents living in areas adjacent to areas already served would be the first step in providing cable in the county. For example, Blough said re sidents living in the Sunrise Mobile Home Park on Scott Blvd. do not get cable television because they Jive outside tbe city's limits. \"You are going to get a lot of heat from certain areas,\" Blougb said. \"People are going to say 'look, my neighbor just across the street has cable and I don't, just because be lives in the city and I live in the county.' \" Wednesday.

After all, they're made by different brewers using different ingredients and different brewing processes. Still, it takes a pretty educated tongue to tell them apart. , . You may not win, but you can't lose. How do Schlitz, Budweiser and Miller compare on taste? That's for you to decide. Simply rate each beer from 1 to 10 on the flavor characteristics below. When you're finished, try to guess the brands by name. Very, very few people can do this. Does the taste of a beer ever change? Yes. All beers have changed over the years. One example is Schlitz.Two years ago a master brewer named Frank Sellinger came to Schlitz. He came to be president. And to brew a Schlitz that was smoother than any other beer. Taste that beer for yourself. Because taste is what it's all about. The best beer is #. ____ ----,. __ _ = 8 E rn =~ :lO u.> ~ ;: 10 g. 8 7 6 5 4 This test requires a blindfold.

The one you pick may not be your beer, but it's the beer with the taste you want. See? You can't lose. What is that taste you're tasting?' Maybe beer tastes so good because you're really tasting each sip more than once. First. the lively, refreshing character of beer comes from the aroma and flavor of the hops.

WI Artificial eloquence Events of the last few weeks indicate that Ronald Reagan has no clear idea of the tremendous responsibility of being president. He talks first and thinks later, has no clear understanding of the constitution and would apparently rather be dramatic than right. Since the Republican convention, Reagan has spent his time con\u00ad fusing himself, his running mate, the American people and foreign observers over what his China policy would be. He has also pandered to the religious far right. Speaking to a group of Christian fundamentalists , Reagan announced that the biblical story of creation, (God made the world in six days and on the seventh He rested), should be taught in public schools. He did not say, however, that the Hindu or Buddhist stories of creation should be ta ught. What Reagan and the religious right do not understand is that the First Amendment provision separating church and state was written both to prevent government control of religion and religious control of government. At the time the amendment was adopted, memories of the New England experiment were fresh. The governments of some New England states had been controlled by the Presbyterians\u00ad Congrega tiona Ii sts' who banished or hung members of other religions because of thei r views. The First Amendment erected a wall between church and state so that never again would one religious sect be able to disen\u00ad franchise and punish another sect. Teaching creationism in the public schools is a clear imposition of the dogma of one sect on members of other faiths. Reagan opened his campaign by trying the old guilt by associa\u00ad tion numbet and in the process smearing the South and making himself look petty. He tried to link Carter to the Ku Klux Klan by accusing him of \"catering to the city that gave birth\" to the Klan, and chastising him for opening his campaign in Tuscumbia, Ala., \"the city that give birth to and is the parent body of the Ku Klux Klan.\" But in the speech at Tuscumbia , Carter spoke out strongly against the Klan. He angrily accused the Klan of practicing cowar\u00ad dice and counseling fear and hatred. Once again Reagan either got his facts wrong or ignored them for the sake of drama. The Klan originated in Pulaski, Tenn. Reagan's ignorance of history, the Constitution and the impor\u00ad tance of accurate information as a basis of judgment, and his ap\u00ad parent dedication to style over substance is not reasurring in a presidential candidate. Dictating concert fare The baptists who have protested country music star Willie Nelson's recent concert in Austin, Texas, have again demonstrated the danger of religious interference in public musical events. One Austin protester explained the need to ban the concert this way: \"We object to his lifestyle, like he smokes and drinks.\" Smoking and drinking are prohibited in the baptist religion. Nelson was raised as a baptist, but considers himself \"Christian, anyway.\" . Nelson seems inoffensive . He is popular for his renditions of religious classics, such as \"Amazing Grace.\" From a Christian standpoint , he would seem to be among the least objectionable popular singers today. And those who have protested the Austin concert should have considered that the proceeds were slated for a ~chool for the handicapped . All this is reminiscent of citizens' petitioning efforts to ban the Kiss concert in Cedar Rapids last October. The citizens conten\u00ad ded, for example, that the title \"Kiss\" stood for Knights In Ser\u00ad vice of Satan. Although the group does engage in such flashy tricks as \"eating\" flre and painting their faces with evil-looking designs, there has never been the slightest indication that the group is seriously satanic. The anti-Kiss petition failed to prevent the group from playing, ~ just as the anti-Nelson protest did not work. Nonetheless, the Cedar Rapids group may have succeeded in what one protester termed their real objective: to prevent Kiss from appearing there again. The question here goes deeper than whether Kiss is really a devil-worshiping group, or whether Nelson smokes or drinks. At issue in both cases is the assumption by some in the Christian com\u00ad munity that they can tell area residents what events to attend. Adults can presumably look out for themselves .

Some of the reasons why the United States should give aid to Zimbabwe were good. However, I found that some of the reasons were based on what the United States would get out of it, rather than for humanitarian reasons. She writes: \"It produces and exports products we need, most importantly chrome ... ,\" Such a dollar-oriented foreign policy does not produce a lasting friendship with the receiving country. If the Unlted States gives aid to Zimbabwe so the people of Zim\u00ad babwe can rebuild their country, I am sure the Zimbabweans will not forget the nations that have come to their aid in a time of need. Schuppener also mentioned that aid to Zimbabwe will \"show South Africa that majority rule does not lead to chaos and provide a stable pro-western government to help the rest of Africa in its development .. \" For South African whites to think that black ma\u00ad jority rule leads to chaos is blindness to African history. The black people were governing themselves before the Dutch settlers 'came in the. 17th cen\u00ad tury. There have been black indepen\u00ad dent nations like Liberia and Ethiopia, Ghana and the rest of Black Africa. There were African kingdoms before the present Western democracies . For South Africa, the \"writing is written on the wall\" -majority rule is in\u00ad evitable. Moreover, African govern\u00ad ments are not the only ones that have had problems. Portugal, Italy and Spain are good examples ol Cba081n the Western world, The West Is not Immune to problema. In addition, Zimbabwe does not need to be \"pro-western\" as Schuppener Im-' plies. Zimbabwe does not necessarily need to be aliRlled with the East or the OOONESBURY COMe/H, aM-f61N, PEAf(./ \\ Letters West. We have to recognize its iden\u00ad tity. Zimbabwe is an African nation. Africans have a right to develop their own philosophy of government. In the meantime, aid to Zimbabwe will help its people to be themselves . Ngoni Sengwe 1002 E. College St. Strengthening the railroads To the editor: America's railroads are dying. What does Jim Leach think we can do about it? He believes that with a few sub\u00ad Sidies here and there, the private sec\u00ad tor will be able to solve our problems. This ignores the fact that the private sector is causing the problems through corporate diversification and a preference for short-term profit over the long-term investments that our rail system so desperately needs. Jim Larew calls for the federal government to take over the un\u00ad profitable rail systems, leaving the profitable lines in the hands of private industry. The Dally Iowan's endorse\u00ad ment of Larew's proposal (D!, Aug. 1) ignores the fact that once again tax\u00ad payers would be stuck with the bill for private industry's mistakes. Such \"lemon socialism\" is an encourage\u00ad ment for rail companies to continue their policy of squeezing the rallways dry and sinking their revenues into other more lucrative investments. A more sensible alternative is for the public to take over all rail systems, us\u00ad ing the profitable tracks to finance a rebuilding of the unprofitable. This is not a new idea. The United States is virtually the only country in the world that continues to use a mostly private rail system. In the past, short-sighted govern\u00ad ment policies have favored the development of highways, allowing the railways to decay. Public subsidy of the highway system for freight and passenger transport has created a wasteful and unsustainable dependence on private trucks and automobiles . These vehicles consume more petroleum fuel than a national railroad and municipal mass transit systems. For years, socialists have been ad\u00ad vocating the nationalization of the railroads and the oil companies . It is clear that only a nationally coor\u00ad dinated transportation and energy plan will save and create jobs, while providing service to the many instead of profit to the few. I believe it is time for us to start talking about the very real alternatives that democratic socialism can offer. Gloria Williams Iowa Socialist Party candidate for lst District Rep. 625 Iowa Ave. The greek system To tbe editor: Congratulations to The Daily Iowan. You actually printed an article about the greek system. Even though the a r\u00b7 ticle reported a negative side to some fraternities in the greek system, it was an accomplishment for the DI. I must, though, point out some irregularities wi th the story. I think the term \"dirty rush\" was an unfair and unjust one to the frater-' nilies involved, as well as the greek system itself. \"Dirty rush\" brings to mind such activities as hazing, high pressure tactics on rushees to join a house and promises that can never be kept. All of these activities have ltq ago been abolished by every individUli ' fraternity on the UI campus. IDSteadail using the term \"dirty rush,\" wouldn'l it be more appropriate to say tlJal fraternities were \"breaking !he rules\" of rush week? ditions and a in state .' bare-bones budget\" III . \"But you can also ,,\" budget and in the d\u00b7, Iowa State will '.

But he said be has heard only \"rumors\" that a few senators will be resigning. He has not received official notification from any of them. Hagemann said one reason for the low turnover rate is that the first senate race results last spring were ruled invalid and the race had to be rerun.

Kathy Tobin, senate vice president, said that sbe plans to contact at least two senators before the senate's Thursday meeting to see if they plan to retain their seats. \"I KNOW there are some people who .,qon't be able to keep their seats,\" she said. \"One moved out of the dorms and one is not a student.\" BOth Htgemann and Tobin declined to name the senators who may be leaving until more specific information is gathered. Hagemann said that when vacancies become available, the senate accepts peti\u00ad tions to fill the seats.

Wednesday , September 3, 1980 -Iowa City, Iowa 7 Area clinics provide birth control advice By Caelly Tobin StaHWrlter Choosing a method of birth control is often a difficult task, and in Iowa City, the choice may be further complicated by having to decide where to go and who to believe when seeking birth con\u00ad trol ~nformation. Besides the gynecological clinic at Student Health, there are three other establisbments that offer birth control services in the area -Emma Goldman Clinic for Women, Iowa City Family Planning Service and the Wesley House's Free Medical Clinic. Dr. Patricia Hicks, head of the gynecology clinic at UI Student Health, said. \"I think that the Pill is an ideal contraceptive for the healthy young female.\" Hicks said she favors the birth con\u00ad trol pill because it is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy , if used correctly. Hicks said she would recommend the Pill to women who have a normal health history and a nor\u00ad mal examination . OTHER methods, including the in\u00ad trauterine device, the diaphragm and the rhythm method, are significantly less effective in preventing pregnancy , she said. In a group of 115 pregnant women who were seen last year by Student Health, 50 were not using any birth control method at the time of concep\u00ad tion. three were using oral contracep\u00ad tives (two incorrectly), 28 were using diaphragms and the rest were using some other method, Hicks said. \"This gives an indication of the method failure of birth control devices other than the Pill,\" Hicks said. But Paula Klein, a lay health care worker at the Emma Goldman Clinic for Women, said, \"We tend to stress the negative aspects of the Pill more than the medical profession does.\" \"The Pill is a quick and easy technology, \" developed and marketed without having been adequately tested for safety, Klein said. \"n's not at all safe. It's a massive experiment on women,\" she added. sultaIJon with health care workers. Klein said. Women may schedule an appoint\u00ad ment for a gynecological examination and for administration of the birth COII\u00ad trol method they choose. Additional counseling and training is given during this session, Klein said. The Student Health clirtic offers two 13\u00b7minute audio-visual presentations covering the lISe, advantages and dis\u00ad advantages of birth control methods_ Hicks said these materials are used because the clinic does not have enough staff members to counsel women individually and because atten\u00ad dance at group sessions on birth con\u00ad trol tends to be low. Hicks said following the presenta\u00ad tions anyone with more questions can talk to her or to a nurse practitione r, or they can \"think about it for a While.\" ALTHOUGH she bas had to take many women off the Pill because of side-effects such as migraine headaches and high blood pressure, none of her patients have ever had serious complications like blood clotting or stroke, Hicks said. \"Sure there's a risk and you have to tell people there's a risk in taking the Pill. But they're taking it to prevent a pregnancy. There's a greater risk of death in terms of pregnancy,\" H.icks said. Anne Rapp, a nurse practitione r at Iowa City's Family Planning Service, said about 400 UI students visit the ser\u00ad vice yearly. Individual counseling on all birth control methods is given by trained medical profeSSionals, Rapp said. Gynecological exams and additional counseling on the specific birth control methods are also provided. Rapp said the service does not favor any particular method over the others, although they try to Inform women of the risks and negative side effects of a 11 methods. Linda Knox, an administrator at the Free Medica I Clinic In the Wesley House, said their policy is to dis\u00ad courage UI students from USing the clinic's services because they are only equipped to serve the permanent Iowa City community _ enough trouble already.\" UI scholarship and accounting ad-. ministrator . Philip Hubbard, vice president for student services, said he did not realize the ur let students with delinquent pay\u00ad ments continue their studies. But he said he felt the practice would apply in tbe case of students with a \"blUe-chip\" guarantee of their tuition payment. In all but special cases, Hubbard said, students with delinquent bills would be notified that their registra\u00ad tion had been canceled. They would not be reinstated without paying their debts and a $10 reinstatement fee. Foreign students with delinquent bills can take out bank loans or seek funds from relatives who live in the United States. Hubbard said. But he said the Office of Student Financial Aids would be unable to give the Ira\u00ad nian stUdents a loan because their debt exceeds $500 . WORKERS at the clinic also try to overcome some patients' negative feel\u00ad ings about using barrier methods, such as the diaphragm and the cervical cap, by informing and training patients on proper use of these methods, Klein said. ABOUT 5 percent to 10 percent of the patients seen at the clinic are UI stll\u00ad dents. Students' registration is canceled only if there is an indication that the ur will not receive payment, Gerlach ex\u00ad plained. \"No one has been canceled because we expect to be paid.\" . Iran holds talks By United Press International THE Iranian government owes the UI $3,401 for spring semester tuition for four students. The ur received a $1,000 payment from the Iranian ~overnment in July, which reduced Iran's prime minister met twice with President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr Tuesday to discuss his cabinet and other \"important state questions,\" Tehran Radio reported, in the midst of another overture on the U.S. hostages from the State Department.

The story, deceptively straightforward , : concerns Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal), forced to leave his native Ireland and seek his fortune in. a world of war, deception, gambling and aristocratic extravagance . C Each time he thinks he has secured the life ~ he desires, his ambitions are thwarted. : This episodic series of reversals, the film's ; entertaining first half, oddly blends humor and tragedy, advent~re and romance, But in the slower-paced second half, the ~ Kubrick style transcends the surface narrative.

By setting the novel in the first person, Thackeray allowed Barry to incriminate himself, a scoundrel flouting the social rules of the 18th century. Kubrick, by contrast, criticizes the social forms themselves, presenting Barry as the helpless victim of a society gone wrong - like Alex in A Clockwork Orange, Dave in z001, Danny in The Shining. He uses the third person (in the voice-over narration) to distance us from the characters ' motiva\u00ad tions, so we may view ironically the social rituals they unquestioningly accept. The duel, in particular, is the height of civilized absurdity; only by violating its rules does Barry perform his one act of buman dignity. THE FILM reinforces narrative distance with visupl distance. The dominant camera movement is the slow zoom out from close\u00ad up to an extreme long shot. Aside from the dramatic effect of graduaIly revealing a stunning pictorial composition , this shot pulls us away from tbe characters, spatially and psychologically , shifting our relationship with nature, fate and time, and C . t t f e g ~~s I Course descriptions and schedules are available at the Art Resource I the histor.lcal narrative becomes, a D~~n~~ :fe Be~i:vers~ I Center Monday -Friday 9 am -10 pm; Saturday 9 am -6 pm; Sunday ~ metap~ortcal comment on SOCial was convicted of anti-I 10 am -10 pm. .. repressiveness .

Cloekwork Orange, he points out the dangers of a society that values technology over moral development ; in The Sbining, he exposes the social restrictions undermining the family. Barry Lyndon, the most pessimistic of his recent films, allows its protagonist only a brief moment of freedom from the system. THOUGH the film demands our ironic distance, Kubrick wisely allows us scenes of intense emotion and unexpected ten\u00ad derness. The Irish traditional music by the Chieftans and selections by Handel, Mozart, Schubert, Bach and Vivaldi form a soundtrack as rich as the visual imagery, Barry Lyndon will be shown at 7: 15 tonight at the Bijou. 19811nfinily Has Arrived THE 1981 INFINITY LOUDSPEAKER IS A SUPERIOR BUY\u00ad HERE'S WHY: ~ : British cancer patient Courses in Aging -Fall 1980 'The state-of-the-art EMIT tweeter gives you excellent depth and definition through the high frequencies .

At an emotional news conference, a weeping Fox, ~ 22, told reporters he had trouble breathing Monday and doctors who examined him overnight diagnosed the new cancer. \"1 had primary cancer 3'1a years ago,\" he said. , \"Now I've got cancer in my lungs. We've got to go home and try to get more treatment. \"I've done the best I could,\" said Fox, who already has raised $1. 7 million for cancer halfway in his 5,300-mile cross-Canada run. \\ Immediately . after the news conference, Fox, a ~ native of British Columbia, boarded a chartered jet for home, accompanied by his parents and a nurse. FOX, WHO lost his right leg to cancer and runs with the aid of a mechanical limb, was taken to Port Arthur General Hospital Monday when he arrived in Thunder Bay, suspecting he had the flu. \"They took X-rays, they did scans, they did tests,\" said Fox, who was flanked by his parents. Breaking into tears, he added, \"I've got it in my lungs.\" \"I can't believe it. While running across the coun\u00ad try. I believed myself to be in perfect health,\" he said. With a tinge of bitterness, he added, \"It didn't shock me at all. I don't think anything would shock me any more. \"1 accepted it even before it happened. I thought even before I went in (the hospital) that it was possi\u00ad ble beca'use of the pain I had in my chest.\" ,Continuous oxygen helps lung patients WASIDNGTON (UPl) -Patients with lung dis\u00ad ease that severely impairs breathing capability I fare better with around-the-clock oxygen treatment v : than those who receive oxygen for only 12 hours a day, a team of scientists reported Tuesday, The findings could affect Medicare reimburse\u00ad I ment for such life-support oxygen therapy. The Health Care Financing Administration is in the process of establishing guidelines for the amount of therapy which would be eligible for relmbursement, and a spokeswoman said the new study results would be taken into consideration. : The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute es\u00ad I tirnated that between 250,000 and 500,000 Americans , require oxygen treatment for chronic lung impair\u00ad : ment at a stage which almost always leads to death. : Such therapy generally costs about $250 a mooth when administered 12 hours a day and $500 a mooth for 24 hours a day. EARLIER STUDIES suggested that oxygen ad- mlnlstered for 12 hours at night milbt be as effective as continuous oxygen in preventing the complica\u00ad tions of oxygen deficiency from conditions In which the lung can no longer supply the body with needed olygeD. But the new, three-year study supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood InsUtute foWld that death rates were almost halved by 24-bour oxygen therapy over periods of one alld two years. \"While nocturnal olygen therapy may be less ex\u00ad pensive, It is not as effective In extending life In patients with this particular lung disease,\" said Dr. Claude Lentant, director of the insUtute's division of lung diseases. .

Heaton said there are other little known parking fines that can be levied against the uninformed motorist: -A person parked in a one-hour limit pa rking space can receive a $2 ticket for each hour they neglect to fill the meter. -A person can be fined $5 for park\u00ad ing on any bridge in the city that does , not have a marked parking lane. -A person can also be fined $5 for parking within 15 feet of an intersec-tion, within five feet of a fire hydrant, in any parking space designated for the handicapped and for parking anyplace in the downtown area not specifically marked as parking space. -A person can have there car towed for leaving it in the same place on any public street for more than 48 hours and for parking anywhere on private property that the property owner does not want a vehicle parked.

They do make up their own minds sometimes .\" The Democratic Party in Johnson Countv has just enough money to keep their head quarters open, and the only form of aid it will receive is for the voter identification program, Cox said. Some Republican candidates, on the other hand, will receive money from the state GOP central committee . The state GOP also has a phone bank matching program, where it supplies \u00b7the county party with telephones for its own voter identification effort. Republican candidates receiving funds from the county party indicated they will for the most part use the money for advertising . Russell Ross, a VI political science professor, said the additional advertiSing may be needed to gain the name recognition the can\u00ad didates may need to win in this traditionally Democratic county. \"I think actually the most effective advertising is grass roots, door-t.o-door campaining ,\" Ross said. \"However, if there's an identification problem -if the candidate is not known -he might need more advertising . \"It (advertiSing) may help,\" he said, \"but certainly if you look at the past 30 years' record m Johnson County, they (Republican candidates) have got a tremendous uphill battle. U's the only chance they've got.\" VP Continued from page 1 tL__ _____ _ \"From the standpoint of political ef\u00ad fectiveness, we realize that this is a state George Bush won,\" said Mick Lura, executive director of the Reagan-Bush effort in Iowa, referring to Bush's caucus victory last January. \"We are hoping to arrange for Governor Reagan to come to Iowa once for sure and possibly two or three Urnes,\" Lura said. \"This state Is con\u00ad sidered important and we know Bush is strong here.\" WILLlAMSueppel , an Iowa City at\u00ad chairman of Carter's re-election cam\u00ad paign, said the president is expected to make one visit to Iowa, though it has not yet been scheduled. Sueppel said intense post-Labor Day campaign schedules do not allow can\u00ad didates to spend much time in anyone state -especially a state with only eight electoral votes. \"Partly it's because of the number of electoral votes, and partly it's because of the demands on the candidates,\" Sueppel said. \"We're hoping we'll get Hours: 10-5:30 T, W, F, S 10-' M&Th Sen. (Edward) Kennedy to come to the state and Rosalynn (Carter), Miss Lillian (Carter) and other members of the family and that should amount to a lot of campaign visits.\" Neither Lura, nor Sueppel said they expect either Bush or Mondale to serve as \"hatchet men\" during the cam\u00ad paign. That label was given to 1976 Republican vice presidential candidate Robert Dole after many Democrats said he made unfair, aggressive at\u00ad tacks on candidate Jimmy Carter's record and character while President Gerald Ford's campaign remarks were more reserved. \"Walter Mondale has never done that and is not cut out to be like a Sen. Dole,\" Sueppel said. \"I just don't think either man will play that role this year. \" Lura agreed, saying, \"Reagan has always said the things that needed to be said. Both Bush and Reagan will equally go after the Carter administra \u00ad tion record. I don't think we'll see any one being the hatchet man. At least we haven't so far.\" . $4.25 to $27.00 Large Selection the VI affirmative action director. \"The needs of I For more infor-I ~~~!s~~ngsters are first, and then comes dollars and I mation calt 338-I The Daily Iowan Hoyle I __ -'-______ _______________ _ lack of a written employment policy.

The three challenging candidates also attacked the district's program for gifted and talented students. Hoyle said: \"The time and the money needs to be devoted to the youngsters who need it -like those with learning disabilities.\" Lockett said: \"I believe they are only a beginning, and I am opposed to them because tbey only repre- sent the top 3 percent of our children.\" I I I 328 S.

RAYMOND Kas: Department of TI II Want to aD ty,lowa 10 80's Wednesday, September 3,1980 -Iowa City, Iowa 1 I 1 Baling hay Jury investigates former city official DES MOINES (UPI) -State Auditor Ricbard Johnson Tuesday questioned the legality of two business transactions involving a former Fort Dodge city commissioner . Johnson, who has supplied infonnation to a federal grand jury investigating alleged improprieties by former city officials, singled out ex-commissioner Virgil Wilshusen for criticism in an audit covering the last half of 1979. The report, which examined a range of city finances, said the May I, 1979, sale to the city of a motor vehicle previously owned by Wilshusen ap\u00ad pears to have violated Iowa's connict~f-interest law. The statute bars cily officials from doing business with their cities. The audit found Wilshusen profitted from the $2,700 sale of an international Scout that he had sold to a third party four days earlier for $200. Johnson said his staff found the $2,700 check was deposited in Wilhusen's bank account and concluded the deal was structured \"to avoid the appearance of the commissioner doing business with the city.\" Uling I hlY liller, O.y. Also questioned by the audit report was the award of a $15,457 painting contract to Wilshusen's brother, Duane. The contract covered painting at the Fort Dodge City Hall between October 1978 and November 1979. Bedell denies any wrongdoing Th. Mill Restaurant FORT DODGE (UP!) -Rep. Berkley Bedell, D-Iowa, lashed out at a former business associate Tuesday after he was angered by renewed publicity about a federal investigation of his fishing tackle business. During a series of news conferences in his Northwest Iowa district, Bedell reiterated his contention that the 2'year-{)ld investigation is based on nothing more than the tainted allegations of a disgruntled one\u00ad time employee of Berkley and Co. of Storm Lake, one of the nation's leading dis\u00ad tributors of fishing tackle. The. ex-employee , Frank Devine, repor\u00ad tedly has told federal investigators Bedell conspired with executives of his company to bribe Taiwanese officials and to avoid paying U.S. customs duties on imported fishing gear.

Now Showing Synthetic fuel billion ~ KUt.rWfltt(~~Af<ir' ~/S'~CA~WAy 18f~tl\" $OIIIJ , \" ! r WASHINGTON (UPI) -The Energy Department has launched what amounts to a crash program to find synthetic fuel projects on which it can lavish $5 billion in public subsidies before the middle of next year, of\u00ad ficials said Tuesday. Agency officials told reporters that draft solicitations for the awards were sent last wee~ to abQut M1icita\u00ad tion for project proposals would follow by Sept. 15. The awards -$3 billion authorized under the Defense Production Act and $2 billion from the Federal Non\u00ad nuclear Energy Research and Develo\u00ad ment Act -are supposed to maintain momentum in synfuel development while the government 's new Synthetic Fuels Corporation is being organized. THE PROPOSALS would be due by Dec. I, giVing sponsors a scant 75 days to complete their paperwork and probably ensuring that each proposed project is already well advanced. \"It's a departure from normal prac\u00ad tice, but one we think is in the interest of the country,\" said acting Energy Undersecretary Worth Bateman, who added that the agency hopes to commit all the money by the end of next June. Asked whether politics might have motivated the agency's rush to spend the $5 billion, Bateman said it was un\u00ad likely, but still possible, that some of the money could be firmly committed by Inauguration Day. Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan has expressed hostility toward the concept of a public Syn\u00ad thetic Fuels Corporation and govern\u00ad ment involvement in industry in general. THE PUBLIC synfuels corporation , authorized by a law signed earlier this summer, is supposed to set up a fledgl\u00ad ing synthetic fuels industry with the aid of $20 billion in federal grants and price, loan and purchase guarantees . Bateman said his agency's subsidies, which will include loan and price guarantees and purchase commit\u00ad ments, respond to a clear con\u00ad gressional requirement for an interim program and will not pre-empt the public corporation 's efforts. \"We have felt for a long time that the successful passage of synfuels legisla\u00b7 tion should not have the effect of slow\u00ad ing down projects that are ready to go,\" said Bateman. Assistant Energy Secretary Ruth Davis said shale oil would figure prominently in the synfuels produced with Defense Production Act money and that such fuels would be ear\u00ad marked for the military. Fuels derived from biomass, in\u00ad cluding' alcohol fuels and those made from municipal and solid wastes, are not eligible for awards under either law. The Energy Department has already awarded $200 million in grants and cooperative agreements for synfuels project feasibility studies and design. , t , . Dubuque highway . gets DOT ,approval AMES (UPI) -A $59 million plan I for a new four-Jane road through Dubu-I r que was unanimously selected by the , state Transportation Commission , Tuesday. But civic leaders were war\u00ad ned it may be years before the project '';' . is completed. The new highway, Iowa 561, will link , U.S. 7A) and downtown businesses with I the City Island bridge under construc\u00ad !' lion on the nort~ side of Dubuque. Commissioners endorsed a plan that , mixes freeway and expressway stan\u00ad , dards. The mixture cuts the project price by nearly $30 million. 1 ~ \"We think this proposal will do what we need -a good link to the downtown,\" said Sister Ca rolyn Farrell, the mayor of Dubuque. Disputes have delayed the highway , project for nearly 15 years. Only recently have Dubuque groups settled disagreements and supported a bighway route known as the Locust Street West Corridor. The commission backed tbe I corridor, which will now be submitted for federal approval. RAYMOND Kassel, director of the Department of Transportation, said right-{)f-way purchases are scheduled to begin in 1982, but he cautioned funding is not assured for the project. He also noted 10 years elapsed between the selection of an interstate highway route tbrough Waterloo and the beginn\u00ad ing of construction. \"We don't see all the funding as we stand here today, It Kassel. He tben ad\u00ad ded an optimistic note: \"We look to see\u00ad ing some priority primary funding since it has been committed to the corridor from Davenport north. But that is still to come.\" Dubuque civic leaders have pressed for speedy action on the highway. They say the future of a $50 million downtown shopping mall is tied to promises the new highway will be built. Under the plan approved by tbe com\u00ad mission, the new roadway will be an expressway as it approaches Dodge Street from the south. It will be a freeway from Dodge Street north to the new bridge. Freeways are bullt at standards similar to interstate highways. Ex\u00ad pressways are four lane divided highways. Want to buy? Need to sell? Try using a Daily Iowan Classified Ad.

Field hockey squad earns coacl1's respect in Canada I, Heidi McNeil Sports Editor A 4-7-1 record usually isn't something IAl brag about. But Iowa Field Hockey Coach Judith David\u00b7 son seems IAl think otherwise. The record is proof 0'( the women's preseason war\u00b7 mup in Canada a couple weeks ago. The figures, however, are misleading , Davidson claims. \"We played some of the best teams in Canada,\" Davidson said. \"The B.C. (British Columbia) Senior team (one of Iowa's foes) is the favorite for the national title. \"We didn't go IAl Canada to win all of the games. We just wanted to get some good competition before our regular season begins. If we had woo all the games, it would have been a waste going there. We wanted to play teams who were a step above us. \"Our team is very cohesive now,\" Davidson said. \"The players are approaching the game in a mature manner. And, I believe a strong sense of mental lAlughness has developed. I know now that we will play well all season.\" THE WOMEN'S first game was against the Un\u00ad iversity of ViclAlria Aug. 18. The game ended in a I-I tie. The next day, Iowa beat the ViclAlria Summer Games team, 7'(), and lost 3-1 to the Victoria Dirty 308. On Aug. 20, Iowa defeated Simon Frazier Un\u00ad iversity, 3-1. They lost to the University of British Columbia, a-o, the following day. The Hawkeye women were downed by the nationally-ranked British Columbia Senior team, 5\u00b71, Aug. 21. The senior team consists of the 11 best players in the province. The Iowa team played five games in the West Van\u00b7 couver Tournament , Aug. 23 and 24. The Hawks lost four of the five, beating only the Victoria Rebels, 3'(). The Iowa women lost to the Doves, 3-2, North Van\u00b7 couver, 2.(), the British Columbia Seniors, 3.(), and West Vancouver , 3-2. DA VIDSON SAID the second meeting with the British Columbia Senior team was much better. \"We were a lot more ready for them.\" she said. \"We showed better defense and moved the ball bet\u00ad ter. We hung in there even though we were really ,tired after playing two other games that day.\" The Hawks left Canada on a winning note. On Aug. 25, Iowa topped the British Columbia Under\u00b723 team, 4-2. This team consists of the province's best athletes between the ages 19 and 23. \"It was a very exciting game.\" Davidson said. \"Our players knew it was the last game and went all out. \" Davidson cited goalkeeper Donna Lee as \"outstanding \" in the final game. \"I was very impressed with the poise our players showed in all of the games,\" Davidson said. \"They played like well\u00b7trained athletes.\" Davidson wa.s 'wonderful hockey weather -cool and crystal clear.\" She added the playing fields were like \"putting greens -perfectly manicured. \" THE IOWA TEAM needs 8-10 additional players. \"Everyone is welcome,\" Davidson said. \"We'll teach them what they need to know.\" The team opens its regular season a t the Cen tra I Missouri Tournament Sept. 12 and 13. \"We'd like to see some Iowa fans come out for the home games,\" Davidson said. \"We're going to be an exciting team. That's what field hockey is -fast. fantastic fun.\" Iowa prepares for final scrimmage Iowa Foetball Coach Hayden Fry sent his team through a \"routine\" workout Tuesday in preparation for Thursday's final scrimmage . \"Everyone worked hard tnday.\" Fry said. \"We had them do a lot of running. We're making it real tough. \"It's hard IAl keep everyone motivated like this without a game,\" Fry said. \"but they're doing a great job.\" Fry said a few more of the injured returned IAl practice Tuesday. He said he's hoping everyone is healthy again by Thursday's scrimmage . Freshman running back J .C. Love Jordan is one of the question marks for Thursday's test. \"He still has a balloon-sized knee.\" Fry said. \"We drained some more water off of it. He's going to need to par\u00b7 ticipate Thursday.\" Fry said his recruits are doing well. \"For freshmen, they're looking good. They just need more repetition and to gain more confidence .\" The Hawkeyes' depth problem is also improving, Fry said. The return of injured players should help that situation. he added. Thursday's scrimmage will determine the travel\u00b7 ing squad for the Sept. 13 game against Indiana in BloominglAln . Opening NCAA football no treat AUSTIN, Texas (UPI) -Texas coach Fred Akers knew the question was coming sooner or later and he seemed to be ready for it. What would he do if he was again asked to move an important game from the middle of the season for\u00b7 ward to the opening week of the campaign. \"I would say thanks,\" Akers said, \"but no thanks.\" J Arkansas coach Lou Holtz is not y'et down on record on the topic, but he would in allilidihood be opposed as well-particularly considering the fact his team was whipped in the 1980 NCAA kickoff game Monday night, 23-17.

The slightly-built, 21-year-old Californian, who quietly bas worked his way up to 18th place on the world rankings, was In total ~ntrol against the 13th seed, continually passing Gott\u00ad fried when be came to the net. Telt.scher, without a tournament victory this year and a flrsWound wipeout In the 1979 Open, registered two early breaks In the opening set and never gave Gottfried a chance to climb back, breaking him three times In the final set. \"I don't think the heat bothered me,\" Gottfried said. \"What bothered me was Eliot's passing shots. I felt good. I felt I was hitting the ball fine. He hits his lobs firm and hard, so even if you get to Making up ain't hard to do Detroit Tigert' outfielder AI Cowen., left, and Chicago While Sox pitcher Ed Farmer met at home pllteln Tiger Stadium Monday to .hake hand. and .ay he WI. lOrry.

When The Daily Iowan Sports Editor Heidi McNeil asked me to do a weekly intramural column, I was pretty ex\u00ad cited. I believe my credentials in the 1M field make me a knowledgeable source for writing this column. I have managed a championship coed 1M team, the Carroll Hawkeyes, for three years; have been part of the Recreational Services Committee for three years and know the 1M and Rec Services personnel very weU. I dreamed about all the great and flowery things 1 might say' about my friends in the Rec Office and the 1M program that is enjoyed by more than 6,000 students, faculty and staff each year. I thought I might elaborate in my first column about the 59 sports and events offered in men's, women's and coed divisions. I also considered dis\u00ad cussing the scope of 1M from the relax\u00ad ing aspect to the fierce competition of the AU\u00b7University Championship . HOWEVER , I'm not going to write about any of those things because I'm upset with the 1M program. I'm not go\u00ad ing to get an 1M manager's jacket. That's right. You bet. The 1M office will award all 1M managers a neat jacket if they enter thei r team in at least 60 percent of the events offered in their respective division. It's a black, lined, lightweight jacket with gold let\u00ad t~ring . Nice. Here I manage the All\u00b7University champs three straight years and I am twice named Outstanding Coed Manager and all I got was a dumpy T\u00ad shirt that shrunk every lime I washed it. I ended up using it as a painter's rag this summer. I Dan Pomeroy The minute I decide to get out of the management business, the 1M office goes big. Really makes me mad. WHEN I WAS in fifth grade, every class before us got to go to the Slate Capitol in Des Moines, but my class didn't get to go. To sour me more, every class after .us got to go. I c0n\u00ad tinued being ripped off. At my Senior Prom, the junior class decided not to have a banquet -just a dance. No free meal for this guy. And nOli no free jacket. I guess it's the story of my life. The 1M managers' meetings are set for Thursday in the Lettermen's Lounge of the Field House. Sorority and women's independent team managers meet at 4 p.m.; men's dorm at 4:30 p.m.; women'!t dorm and in\u00b7 dependent at 5, p.m.; and men's in\u00ad dependent and professional and social fraternities at 5:30 p.m. THE 1M\u00b7 PEOPLE will tell you all about the new bi-weekly newsletter to all 1M managers, the new events this year, band out the latest entry fonns and 1M booklets and explain rules and changes. The meeting is important to get your dorm floor, Greek house or in\u00ad dependent group off to a good start. It's also a great chance to meet !he 1M staff and all the new graduate stu\u00ad dents who work with 1M sports. Go ahead and go. They'll probably tell you all about the damn jackets, too! Gophers to give 'run-and-shoot' style second try By Heidi McNeil Sports Editor Fourth of nine articles previewing BIQ Ten football teams. \"Smokey\" Joe Salem wasn't kidding when he promised wide-open football for Minnesota fans in his first year as head coach last season. But his \"run\u00ad and\u00b7shoot\" policy didn't work quite the way he had anticipated . \"Last year I said we'd give you wide\u00ad open football,\" Salem said at the Big Ten Kickoff Luncheon in Chicago last month. \"I didn't really mean that for both offense and defense, but it turned out that way. We led the conference in giving up yards. \"You saw a learn able to move the football almost at will -and also give . up yards at will. We started out the season great, then collapsed at the end. I don't know what happened. I think we lost because we just didn't know how to win.\" THE GOPHERS were gaining aUen-The Dally Iowan/Kathleen Dee MlnnetOta cOich Joe Salem lion around the conference early last year and were in contention for a bowl bid. They threatened to upset mighty Ohio State in their second game, losing 21-17. They blasted hapless Northwestern, 38-8, before stunning Purdue, 31-14. MiMesota even put a damper on Iowa's homecoming festivities in pulling out a 24-7 victory over the Hawkeyes. But from that point, things went haywire. The Gophers hit the skids, ty\u00ad ing cellar.oweller Illinois and losing their last three games. Minnesota slip\u00ad ped to a 4-6-1 season mark and sixth\u00b7 place finish in the Big Ten. . GRADUATION took its toU at all positions so Salem must view 1980 as a rebuilding yea r with 60 of the 88 players freshmen and sophomores. Only 12 seniors return. \"I don't look forward to a year like that with the kind of schedule we got,\" Salem said. \"The guy who made up the schedule had to be a genius. How could he have ever guessed who the top teams were going to be 15 years ago when the schedule was made?\" ~innesota must play powerhouses 0~1O State and Purdue on the road and Will. play highly-regarded Southern Callfo.rDla and Michigan in Min. neapohs. The most pressing problem for Salem is replacing Mark Carlson at quarterback . \"Our quarterback situation is horri\u00ad ble at this point,\" Salem said. \"Not one player established himself during spr\u00ad ing drills. All the quarterbacks were stumbling around with no experience.\" Salem has five quarterbacks from which to choose -Bruce Olson, sophomore transfer from North \\ \\ \\ \\ Dakota State; sophomore Greg Olson, a Minnesota baseball player last year; and three freshmen, Bill Swats, Bob Sudier and Tim Salem, the coach's son. ANOTHER PROBLEM is replacing Paul Rogind. Rogind set records at Minnesota for total points scored, more extra points, most field goals and the longest field goal during his four\u00ad year stay. Duane Jurgens, a junior who handled kicking duties in spring practice, and rookie Jim Gallery will attempt to fill the void, Salem said . Senior Tom Smith should lake care of the punting department. Salem said his offensive strength Ues in his backs Marion Barber, Garry White and Glenn Lewis.
