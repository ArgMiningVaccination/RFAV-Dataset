A homeopathic practitioner uses only homeopathy. A homeopath has a far deeper understanding of homeopathy which allows the practitioner to use homeopathy to its fullest extent. A Naturopath uses a number of modalities in their practice including life style changes, nutrition, acupuncture, herbs, supplements and homeopathy. Naturopaths use many supplements in their treatment plan, These supplements are very expensive and are usually used for extended periods of time. For this reason the cost of naturopathic treatment can be much higher than homeopathic treatment. Naturopaths support the body through supplementation and try to remove aggravating factors (food/ environment) from the patients diet. Homeopaths aim to restore health so that the patient is free to engage in all types of food and environments. "}
