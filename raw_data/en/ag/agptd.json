The Food and Drug Administration has accepted Pfizer's application for a COVID-19 vaccine for children under age 5, so vaccination could begin as early as June 21, according to White House COVID-19 response coordinator Ashish Jha, MD. \"We know that many, many parents are eager to vaccinate their youngest kids and it's important to do this right,\" [Dr. Jha said](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/974978) at a White House press briefing June 2. \"We expect that vaccinations will begin in earnest as early as June 21 and really roll on throughout that week.\" Decline may just be underreporting Over on the incidence side of the pandemic, [latest COVID report](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/#). The decline in new cases was not spread uniformly across the four major regions of the United States. The count actually went up in the West for the week of May 27 to June 2, while the South saw the largest decline. The Midwest and Northeast, meanwhile, saw new cases drop for the second straight week, the AAP and CHA said. The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in children was up to 13.45 million as of June 2, with children representing 18.9% of all cases since the start of the pandemic, according to the two organizations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [reported figures](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics) of 13.14 million and 17.5% on June 6. The AAP/CHA estimates, however, are based on state data that have become increasingly hard to obtain and subject to inconsistency. \"Shortages of COVID-19 tests during surges and the increasing use of COVID-19 home tests likely affect the undercounting of COVID-19 cases,\" they noted, and \"at times when COVID-19 transmission is low, states might reduce the frequency information is updated.\" Vaccinations held steady over the holiday The ongoing vaccination effort in children aged 5 years and older did not show a Memorial Day drop-off, as initial vaccinations held at 43,000 in 5- to 11-year-olds and at 27,000 in 12- to 17-year-olds for a second consecutive week. That number has ranged from 34,000 to 70,000 for the younger children and from 25,000 to 47,000 for the older group since mid-March, the AAP said in a [separate weekly report](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-vaccination-trends/). Despite weekly vaccine initiations that have been roughly double those of the older children for months, the 5- to 11-year-olds are still only at 36.0% coverage with at least one dose, compared with 69.5% for the 12- to-17-year-olds. Full vaccination for the two age groups comes in at 29.3% and 59.6%, respectively, as of June 6, according "}
