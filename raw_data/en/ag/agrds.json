Supplements & Herbs At Affinity Acupuncture, we only carry the highest quality supplements and products from professional grade companies. You can rest assured we've done the hard work for you, making sure you're only getting the best so you can see the best results. But, if you're looking for products elsewhere, here's some tips: - Read the ingredients. See what form of the substance is in the supplement, what dosage, and any extra or unnecessary ingredients. If you have to take multiple pills/capsules/etc then that particular one may not be very cost effective, and if it's in a form that your body cannot use or absorb then that is definitely not going to be helpful. - Evaluate the brand. Look for 3rd party certification with cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices). Some credible 3rd party organizations include NSF, US Pharmacopeia, UL, and Natural Products Association. This ensures that the company is producing supplements according to FDA guidelines and their quality is verified by an independent party. - Source carefully. Even professional supplements can now be found on Amazon or other websites. While things may be easy to find, Amazon is not an expert on quality supplements or reliable information, and many products found online are counterfeit with compromised quality. "}
