Naturopath, Remedial Massage, Wellness Support Rebecca obtained her Naturopathy degree from the University of Western Sydney in 2005. Decades of working in-person with clients on the Central Coast has enhanced her professional, flexible, and realistic manner and passion for supportive care. Additional training in Remedial Massage and a degree in Environmental Management, further enriches her balanced, nature-based approach to integrative and holistic medicine. Being a partner to an amazing realist, and parent of two vibrant, strong-willed children, has given Rebecca insights into innovative, grounded, and effective methods for wellness. Our bodies are quite adept at repairing themselves. We use methods that aid that natural ability with modalities like nutrition, herbal medicine, and lifestyle techniques such as breath work and meditation. We believe many illnesses are caused by the toxins in our foods. Avoiding manufactured ingredients and pesticides reduces the harmful substances entering our bodies. Replacing them with cleaner, more organically grown food and natural plant remedies aids the body in healing itself and preventing future disease. Breath work, meditation and 'being in nature' are all a critical element to holistic medicine. These safe, convenient, and economical practices are astonishingly effective promoters of wellness. These lifestyle techniques improve not only physical health, but wellness of the mind and emotions. Meal planning, lifestyle practices and supplementation can be family friendly and sustainable. We are passionate about supporting each family member with the goal of achieving long term, realistic and affordable health and wellness for the family. We are available whether the specific condition be an injury, anxiety, menopause, or digestive complaints. We often support management of multiple conditions as the direction of cure becomes apparent in healing.
