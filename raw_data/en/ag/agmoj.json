The system is designed in a way that it recognizes foreign pathogens and prepares every cell of the body to put up a fight against the invaders. The immune system detects the alien cells known as antigens and forms a series of functions to destroy them. [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5091071/) What constitutes the Immune System? Our immune system is mainly composed of white blood cells. Also known as leukocytes, these cells circulate in the body and are always in the lookout for pathogens. When they come across a foreign cell, they signal to all the cells within the body to get ready to attack the antigen. WBCs either break the antigens or prepare antibodies to fight against the antigens. These white blood cells are derived from the multi-potent cells in the bone marrow region.

When the WBC counts lower, the immune system of the body weakens - allowing several diseases to come and attack the body.
