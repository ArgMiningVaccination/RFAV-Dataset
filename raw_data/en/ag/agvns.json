Careful assessment of the relative risk of existing and new man-made environmental hazards is necessary for the establishment of sound regulatory policy. These regulations serve to enhance the quality of our environment in order to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of our Nation's population. The Health Effects Research Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, conducts a coordinated environmental health research program in toxicology, epidemiology, and clinical studies using human volunteer subjects. These studies address problems in air pollution, non-ionizing radiation, environmental carcinogenesis and the toxicology of pesticides as well as other chemical pollutants. The Laboratory participates in the development and revision of air quality criteria documents on pollutants for which national ambient air quality standards exist or are proposed, provides the data for registration of new pesticides or proposed suspension of those already in use, conducts research on hazardous and toxic materials, and is primarily responsible for providing the health basis for non-ionizing radiation standards. Direct support to the regulatory function of the Agency is provided in the form of expert testimony and preparation of affidavits as well as expert advice to the Administrator to assure the adequacy of health care and surveillance of persons having suffered imminent and substantial endangerment of their health. To aid the Health Effects Research Laboratory to fulfill the functions listed above, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) under EPA Contract No. 68-02-1226 prepares evaluative reports of current knowledge of selected atmospheric pollutants. These documents serve as background material for the preparation or revision of criteria documents, scientific and technical assessment reports, partial bases for EPA decisions and recommendations for research needs. \"Zinc\" is one of these reports.

Thompson was able to ascribe the capability of making a compound of copper, tin and zinc by reduction with charcoal to the Babylonians of 3000 B.C. Semitic bronzes found at Gezer in Palestine and dated 1400 and 1000 1211 B.C. contained up to 23% zinc as well as 10% tin. Although brass was known early in Palestine and was probably used for cymbals and bells, zinc was probably quite unknown. The brass was likely to have been made by smelt- ing a zinc ore with copper and charcoal. The oldest known piece of zinc is the form of an idol found in the pre- historic Dacian settlement at Dordosch, Transylvania. Analysis of the idol showed that it was composed of 88% zinc, 11% lead, and 1% iron. In the ruins of Camiros, destroyed in 500 B.C., two bracelets filled with zinc were found? in the ruins of Pompeii, destroyed in 79 A.D., the upper part of a fountain front was discovered, and the finders claimed that it had been covered with zinc. The Greeks may also have known about and used zinc. Aristotle was said to have spoken about a brilliant white copper produced by adding \"some kind 1042 of earth\" rather than melting tin with copper. Theophrastus, a contemporary of Aristotle, also mentioned an ore which became superior in beauty and color 1042 when mixed with copper. Strabo (60 B.C.-20 A.D.) described an ore \"which when burned becomes iron and when heated in furnaces with a certain earth distils *mock silver1 (pseudargyros), and this with the addition of copper makes the 'mixture* named oreichalkos.\" Mitchell concluded that image: ------- pseudargyros was zinc and the method of smelting through distillation was one which would produce zinc. Other historians are not Convinced that pseudargyros was metallic zinc and suggest that it might have been metallic . , 1025 arsenic or arsenical copper. It is not clear when zinc was introduced as a useful agent in the Far East. However, useful brass products were made by the calamine* process 53 certainly since the beginning of the Christian era, and perhaps even before 12 it. Li suggested that zinc was used by the early Chinese by about the 264 beginning of the Christian era. Forbes speculated that zinc metal was pre- pared by Indian alchemists in the laboratory in the twelfth century, but the 489 process was not applied industrially. The Chinese also were said to know how to make a metal from tutty scraped from the sides of smelting furnaces making lead. The substance was thought to be cadmium, but it was mostly zinc A 37\u00b0 oxide. The Romans were probably the first Europeans to make brass when they began to use it for coins (about 20 B.C.). They discovered that when copper was smelted with calamine ore, a yellow alloy more gold than bronze could be 718 obtained. In its isolated form, zinc was not recognized until the fifteenth century when smelting probably occurred accidentally.12 The word \"zinc\" may be derived from the German noun Zinker, meaning \"jagged part or tooth.\" This word was applicable to the metal because in early smelting endeavors, * A zinc ore. image: ------- zinc was deposited in the furnace in the form of pointed parts. Upon slow cooling, zinc vapor will condense and form clusters of hexagonal crystals with pointed ends. \"Spelter\" was also a name given to zinc and it is related to the word \"pewter.\" The earliest occurrence of the word \"spelter\" was in 1661. Commercial smelting began in the eighteenth century when it was clearly realized that zinc could be obtained from the calamine used to make brass and that it was the same metal imported from India and China. No reports of zinc toxicosis in any form were forthcoming from these early accounts. However, it has been alleged that zinc was applied as an ointment for skin lesions by several cultures of the ancient world, including the Egyptians and other Mediterranean peoples. The first documented usage of zinc administered 554 orally occurred in 1826 when zinc sulfate was used to treat gleet and leucorrhea. The purpose of this document is to attempt to place into perspective the role of zinc in the environment \u2014 its importance as an essential nutrient for all forms of life and its effects as a toxic agent to some species. The effects of zinc are many sided. Because zinc is abundantly distributed throughout the earth's crust and found in many manufactured products, humans come into direct daily contact with several forms of zinc. Zinc is used to manufacture motor oils, lubricants, and rubber tires, and it is found in the fuel oil and coal used for heating and manufacturing purposes; thus, particulate zinc is present in the atmosphere in rural as well as urban areas. This particulate zinc has not been specifically identified as a public health problem. Zinc is essential for the normal activity of DNA polymerase; and hence, for protein synthesis. It plays an important role in the growth, development, and metabolism of living species* In plants and animals the balance between excess and insufficient zinc is important. Plants do not grow well in zinc-depleted or zinc-absent soils, and insufficient dietary zinc in animals and humans leads to poor image: ------- development and other pathophysiologic changes. Dietary zinc replacement usually will reverse the pathologic events of zinc depletion in man and animals, but important exceptions do occur. In rat offspring with congenital malfunctions or behavioral abnormalities associated with zinc depletion, repletion with zinc seems to be of little value. In humans, a major problem is the diagnosis and evaluation of zinc deficiency, particularly if the case is marginal. Excessive zinc in the aquatic environment is of particular importance, because the respiratory systems of fish are very sensitive to the toxic effects of zinc. Water represents a convenient vehicle for disposal of human and animal waste products, which can be quite high in zinc. The toxic effects of zinc in humans are not common medical problems, although they may appear in some metal workers and in some children under special conditions. There is increasing evidence that zinc may be helpful in the treatment of several disorders of man and animals, including skin lesions and the rare disease acrodermatitis enteropathica. However, knowledge of zinc metabolism in humans is still quite limited. image: ------- CHAPTER 2 PROPERTIES AND USES OF ZINC* Among the major common metals (iron, aluminum, copper, lead and zinc), all but zinc are easily recognized as such by the consumer. This distinc- tion is a function of its loss of identity to an end product. Zinc has been found to be beneficial and necessary for proper nutrition of humans, animals, and plants, and a deficient intake has been proved deleterious. Zinc is a bluish-white, relatively soft metal with a density slightly less than iron (7.133 and 7.86 g/cc, respectively). Its atomic number is 30, atomic weight, 65.37, and it is placed in Group II-B of the periodic table. The atomic radius of zinc is 1.31 A and its electron configuration is 2-8-18-2. Zinc is divalent in all its compounds. It is a composite of five stable isotopes: zinc-64, -66, -67, -68, and 48.86%, 27.62%, 4.12%, 18.71%, and 0.69%, respectively, of been identified: zinc-62, -63, -65, -69, -72, artificial isotopes are zinc-65 and zinc-69, which have half-lives of about 244 days for the zinc-65, 14 h for the zinc-69 isomer, and 58 min for zinc-69 itself. Decay products of zinc-65 and -69 are stable copper-65, manufactured by positron emission and electron capture from zinc-65, and stable gallium-69 isotopes, produced by negative *Much of this chapter is derived from the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Mines publication, The U.S. Zinc Industry: A Historical Perspective (.1974). 101*> No other references will be provided in the body of the chapter unless the information comes directly from another source. image: ------- B-emission from the zinc-69 Isotopes. Other characteristics of zinc isotopes may be found in Weast et a.1. The structure of the zinc molecule exhibits a hexagonal close-packed lattice: in A, when a = 2.664 and o = 4.9469, a/o - 1.856. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ZINC Cast zinc, which crystallizes in a hexagonal system, is brittle; but when heated to about 120 C, it becomes ductile and is easily rolled or drawn. After mechanical shaping at about this temperature, the metal does not become brittle again upon cooling. Thus, wrought zinc is used in construction to form roofing and as drawn battery cans for dry power cells. The high electrochemical activity of zinc is surpassed among the common metals only by magnesium and aluminum in the electro- motive series. This activity accounts for one of its major uses: the galvanizing of iron and steel. In such applications, zinc undergoes sacrificial corrosion from the surface of the steel, and protects the substrate from structural degradation. Zinc readily combines with other metals, imparting characteristics of workability at low temperature, cor- rosion resistance, and pleasing finishes for use in die-casting alloys, brass, and other common alloys. Table 2-1 sets forth some physical properties of zinc. CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ZINC Pure zinc at ambient temperatures is highly resistant to attack by dry air, but in temperatures above 225 C the rate of corrosion increases rapidly. In moist air, attack proceeds at room temperature, and in the presence of carbon dioxide it accelerates to form the hydrated basic carbonate, 2ZnC03'3Zn(OH)2' This carbonate image: ------- TABLE 2-1 Some Physical Properties of Zinc Density: solid at 25 C, 7.133 g/cm3 solid at 6.83 g/cm3 liquid at C, 6.62 C, 6.25 g/cm3 Melting point: 419.5 C (692.7 K) Boiling point (1 atm) : 907 C (1,180 K) Heat capacity: solid - Cp = 5.35 f 2.40 x 10~3 T (298 - 692.7 K) cal/mol liquid - Cp 7.50 cal/mol C Linear coefficients of thermal polycrystalline (20 - 250 C) , 39.7 x 10~6 per C Volume coefficient of thermal expansion (20 - 400 C) : 8.9 x 10~5 per C Thermal conductivity: solid (18 C) 0.27 cal/sec cm C solid (419.5 C) 0.23 cal/sec cm C liquid (419.5 C) 0.145 cal/sec cm C liquid (750 C) 0.135 cal/sec cm C Modulus of elasticity: 10 to 20 x 106 psi Surface tension (liquid): Y = 758 - 0.09(t - 419.5 C) dynes/cm Electrical resistivity: polycrystalline (20 C) - 0.139 x 10~6 cgs electromagnetic units a Modified from Schuhmann and image: ------- forms a tightly adhering light gray film which tends to protect the zinc from further corrosion. Halogens react with zinc in the presence of moisture, but not under dry conditions. Reaction with steam at 350 C or higher occurs rapidly. Mineral acids also easily attack zinc: the strongest reaction occurs with sulfuric acid, followed by hydro- chloric., and nitric acids. Zinc displays a vigorous reducing power, liberating hydrogen from sulfuric and hydrochloric acids. This property is the basis for the use of zinc dust or mossy zinc in many commercial organic chemical processes* . Zinc liberates nitrogen oxides instead of hydrogen from nitric acid. The metal is amphoteric, reacting with hot caustic to liberate hydrogen and form zincates. All zinc is inert to petroleum derivatives and anhydrous alcohol but is- oxidized by mixtures of alcohol and water. The chemical properties of zinc compounds make them useful as oxides, carbonates, sulfates, sulfides, chlorides, phosphates, and organic complexes. Commercial grades of zinc contain enough trace impurities to make it more reactive than pure zinc. ZINC METAL AND ALLOYS Commercial grades of zinc metal have been established by the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM)y as listed in Table 2-2.

Brass Special and Intermediate were largely used in alloying with copper to form brass. High-Grade, and eventually Special- High-Grade specifications were established for zinc to be used in alloys containing small-amounts of aluminum. These alloys are us.ed in the die- . cast ing method image: ------- of the coating shows first a layer of pure iron overlaid by a very thin layer of FeZn3, over which is a thicker layer of FeZn7, above which is a layer of essentially pure zinc with a few solid crystals of the FeZny. These various alloys are quite resistant to corrosion and form an adherent bond between the steel base and the zinc. If the galvanized sheet is to be subsequently bent and formed, it is necessary to minimize the alloy formation to avoid cracking and peeling. Tin. Tin is deleterious in very small quantities in rolled zinc, because it causes ruptures during hot rolling. In castings it also promotes subsurface corrosion. However, small amounts of tin will cause an esthetically desirable \"spangle\" on galvanized sheets. Copper . Copper increases strength, hardness, creep resistance, and recrystallization temperature. It may bring on corrosion of zinc in dry cells. ii. At levels of 3.5-4.5%, aluminum reduces grain size, and improves impact strength and castability of zinc. In galvanizing, die casting, and protective galvanic anodes, aluminum beneficially inhibits formation of the zinc-iron alloy. Magnesium. Magnesium counteracts subsurface corrosion effects of tin and lead in zinc alloys. Titanium. Titanium forms a compound rich in zinc. At elevated temperatures, it decreases the grain size of cast zinc and restrains grain growth in rolled zinc. Used in newer rolled zinc applications, it greatly increases creep resistance. One of the chief uses for high-purity zinc is in zinc-base alloys for die-casting. The die-casting process enables a dimensionally accurate equipment part to be produced in a die-casting machine in fractions of a minute. Therefore, few finishing operations are required before use, and the economic advantages are obvious. Table 2-3 reports the chemical and physical properties of die-cast alloys. 10 image: ------- TABLE 2-3 Chemical and Physical Properties for Zinc Die-Casting Alloysa Chemical 'Requirements as Ingot*7 Copper, %.

A zinc-containing alloy in growing use is an aluminum-based die-casting alloy incorporating 2.7-8% zinc. Production with this alloy requires higher die temperatures and slower operating speeds than necessary for the zinc-base alloy, but parts made of it exhibit tensile strengths up to 80,000 psi. Many solders, especially those used on aluminum, contain zinc as well as other alloying metals. Silver and gold solders also are alloyed with zinc. Zinc is a minor component of the copper-zinc alloys known as brass (although brass is the oldest known use of zinc). Commercial brasses con- tain between 5-40% zinc. Brass is superior to copper alone in its greater strength and ductility, and its resistance to corrosion. It is widely used in hardware, plumbing accessories, instruments, communication equip- ment, as well as for aesthetic purposes because of its pleasing yellowish- gold color. Table 2-4 lists composition and properties of some of the more popular commercial brasses. Wrought zinc is composed of commercial grades of zinc to which very small amounts of other metals have been added to alter the properties of the zinc. Important properties of these wrought zinc alloys designed for commercial use include: resistance to corrosion; white and nonstaining corrosion products; chemical characteristics desirable for dry cells and photoengraving plates; mechanical properties for easy forming, machining, and spinning; and good solderability. Table 2-5 lists several of these zinc alloys, and their composition, characteristics and uses. 13 image: ------- TABLE 2-4 Properties of Common Brasses0 Nominal Yield Composition, % Strength, Material copper zinc other Condition 10 psi Gilding metal Commercial bronze Red brass Aluminum brass Admiralty brass Cartridge brass Yellow brass Nickel silver Muntz metal Manganese bronze Architectural bronze a From the 95 90 85 76 71 70 65 65 60 58.5 57 5 10 15 22 28 30 35 17 40 39. 40 Chemical Cold-rolled Engineers' Handbook.1234 50 54 55 27 20 63 55 70 20 50 20 Tensile Strength, 103 psi 56 61 70 60 53 76 70 85 54 80 60 Brinell Hardness 114 125 120 82 60 155 115 170 80 180 95 Density, g/cc 8.90 8.80 8.75 8.33 8.53 8.47 8.47 8.75 8.39 8.36 8.47 Modulus of Elasticity, 106 psi 17 17 17 16 16 16 15 18 15 15 14 b 0 Tin d Nickel e Iron, tin, and manganese, respectively. / Lead image: ------- TABLE 2-5 Classification of Wrought Zinc Alloys'2 Composition % Lead 0.05- 0.10 0.05- 0.10 0.15- 0.10 0.05- 0.10 0.10 0.35 max From Manean 0.012 0.012 0.017 max 0.012 the Metals ese.

As mentioned, dipping steel in a bath of molten zinc results in a coating of 1-2 oz zinc/ *\\ ft2 (311.1-622.2 g/m ) of steel surface. This coating galvanically protects the underlying steel from corrosion because of the higher electromotive potential of zinc over iron. Thus the zinc coating must be entirely corroded away before the iron substrate begins to rust, and the structural strength of the article is preserved by the sacrificial corrosion of zinc. Steel of construction dipped in zinc is the material /for galvanized garbage cans, barbed and woven wire fencing, steel woven cable, highway guard rail, radio and electricity transmission towers, and building structures and bridges. Recent advances control of the in continuous-line galvanizing have made possible better/composition of minor alloying metals in the zinc bath possible. The newer processes are able to provide superior, more economical coatings on continuous steel sheet made for protective building siding, downspout and guttering, air ducts, and automobile and appliance bodies. INORGANIC ZINC COMPOUNDS Because of its high reactivity with other elements and amphoteric character, zinc forms a wide variety of compounds. Zinc sulfates and chlorides are water soluble, whereas the oxides, carbonates, phosphates, silicates, and organic complexes generally are insoluble. Properties of common zinc compounds are tabulated in Table 2-6. In the following discussions of zinc compounds, substances will be listed in generally descending order of commercial volume. 16 image: ------- TABLE 2-6 Properties of Common Inorganic Zinc Point \u00bb C 1,975 \u2014 600 283 ~ 872 394 446 200 980 - - - 800 - 900 1,509 Boiling Point.

Combustion control during formation can modify the particle size and shape to achieve desired properties. A variety of particle shapes and wide size ranges combine with the large interstitial spaces of the compound to provide a kaleidoscope of properties to be manipulated. Zinc oxide is used most in the compounding and vulcanizing of rubber, wherein the properties of high heat capacity and conductivity serve to cool flexing rubber in belts and tires. This compound scavenges any free sulfur remain- ing in the article after the rubber is vulcanized. The high index of refraction of zinc oxide accounts for its use as a pig- ment in white paints to bestow high hiding power. For exterior paints, the ability of a thin film of zinc oxide to completely absorb ultraviolet rays from the sun is useful; it also acts as an effective mildewcide and prevents fungal staining. Zinc oxide commonly is classified by method of production. American Process zinc oxide is made by carbon reduction of roasted zinc ore, and the resultant zinc vapor is burned to form zinc oxide; French Process zinc oxide is produced by burning zinc metal in air; some chemical process oxide is made by precipitating zinc hydroxide (Zn[OH]2) from solution and calcining it to form oxide.1607c ASTM specifications and chemical and physical test values for typical grades of zinc oxide are set forth in Table 2-7, although it should be noted that many producers manufacture many more grades than are listed to accommodate certain specific needs and uses. 18 image: ------- TABLE 2-7 ASTM Specifications and Physical and Chemical Test Values for Zinc Oxide A.

With organic and inorganic acids, it forms simple and complex salts and soaps. Reaction with alkalies form zincates, because zinc is amphoteric. The oxide may be used to catalyze some chemical reactions. One of the oldest uses is pharmaceutical \u2014 in treatment of burns, infections, and skin diseases. A newer use for zinc oxide, which relies on physicochemical properties, was taken up by the photoconductivity field: carefully pro- duced zinc oxides are coated on paper and used in office photocopying appli- cations. The ceramic industry produces frits and glazes in which zinc oxide provides color for pottery or improves the brilliance of glass. Other Inorganic Zinc Compounds Zinc sulfate. Zinc sulfate* ZnSO^ is water-soluble and useful as a hard- ener in viscose rayon spinning baths, and as a flotation reagent in mineral concentrations. It has become increasingly popular as a trace element applied to overcome zinc deficiencies in plants grown in certain areas. Zinc chloride. Zinc chloride* ZnCl2 has a low melting point and is used in galvanizing fluxes, and in preserving and controlling inflammability in wood. It is also an essential ingredient in dry cells, a disinfectant, a printing mordant, and an aid for mercerizing cotton. Zinc sulfide. Zinc sulfide^ ZnS. is usually a component of barium litho- pone, a white paint pigment. Very pure zinc sulfide enjoys widespread use as a phosphor in cathode-ray television tubes and fluorescent lamps. Zinc chromate. Zinc chromate^ ZnCrO^ is a wood preservative, an algicide, and a primer on metal surfaces for protection against corrosion. Zinc carbonate. Zinc carbonate^ ZnC03j like zinc oxide, is now being used more and more as a nutritive supplement for swine, sheep and poultry. 20 image: ------- Zinc borates. Zinc berates, 3Zn0.2B203j are used as fire retardants and as fluoborates for insecticides. Zinc acetate. Zinc acetate. Zn(C2H302).2 chiefly provides mordant for dye- ing and glazes for porcelain, but it is also an astringent and antiseptic. Zinc silicate. Anhydrous zinc silicate, Zn^iO^, is used as phosphor in television screens. Zinc fluosilicate. Zinc fluosilicate, ZnSiFg.6H20, has continued to be an effective laundry sour, concrete hardener, and wood preservative. Zinc cyanide. Zinc cyanide, Zn(CN)2\u00bb serves as zinc carrier in electroplating, and it is used for medicinal purposes to treat epilepsy, neuralgia, etc. It is poisonous, and will evolve hydrogen cyanide, HCN> gas if contacted by mineral acids. Zinc nitrate. Zinc nitrate, Zn(N03)2, finds use as a mordant in dyeing. Zinc phosphate. Zinc phosphate, .ZngCPO^.AH^O, mostly is used in dental cements. Zinc phosphide. Zinc phosphide, Zn.P-, is a common ingredient in rat and mouse poisons. It is dangerous to humans if highly toxic phosphltie gas liberated. Zinc permanganate. Zinc permanganate, ZnpfoOif)2.6H20, finds some applica- tion as an antiseptic and astringent. Zinc peroxide. The powdered form of zinc peroxide, Zn02, functions as a deodorant, astringent, and antiseptic for wounds and skin diseases. ORGANIC ZINC COMPOUNDS Most organic derivatives of zinc are manufactured in very small com- mercial quantities, whereas many of the inorganic compounds are sold in lots of thousands of tons. As in the previous section, the list of compounds is in approximate descending order of commercial volume. 21 image: ------- Zinc soaps. fatty acid salts. They are fine, bulky, soft, white powders that feel greasy, repel water, and generally are soluble in benzene and petroleum derivatives. They are used as lubricants and mold release compounds in rubber and plastic forming, metal die-casting, and medicine tablet making. Zinc soaps also waterproof con- crete, paper, and textiles, and serve as flatting agents in agricultural fungicides, because they are more tolerable to humans than are the mercury, lead, and copper fungi- cides which the zinc salts replace. Some plants even reap nutritional value from the zinc. Zinc bacitracin. Zinc bacitracin is an antibiotic in ointments and prepara- tions for human use and a growth stimulator in swine and poultry nutrition. Zinc propionate and caprylate. Zinc fungicides on adhesive tape coatings, and prepara- 8 15 2 2 tions which combat athlete's foot and other molds, fungi, and bacteria. Zinc phenolsulfonate. Zinc phenolsulfonate, Z9(ei2H,0OgS2\u00bb8H20), is both an insecticide and an antiseptic for internal treatment of ulcers and wounds. Zinc salicylate. Zinc salicylate, (C H-0 ) Zn.3H 0, is an effective astringent and antiseptic. Many other organic salts are used in medicinal applications because small quantities of zinc are toxic to many microorganisms harmful to human, animal, and plant life. Zinc undecylenate. Zinc undecylenate, c22^38\u00b04Zn' is used as a cutaneous fungicide to control dermatophytoses. 22 image: ------- PATTERNS OF USE In the United States, the use of zinc in all forms has increased at a rate approximating that of the real growth of the gross national product. The pattern, of use has shifted from one in which brass and galvanizing were predominant to one in which a much larger share is constituted by zinc-base alloys for die-casting applications. Consequently, the proportion of zinc used for brass, wrought zinc, and other purposes has decreased. Table 2-8 and Figure 2-1 chart some of these trends from 1935-1976. During these years, the total zinc usage in the United States has more than tripled from 566,000 to 1,753,000 metric tons in 1973. This total for 1973 includes the most frequently used statistic of \"slab zinc\" consump- tion (1,364,000 metric tons), plus the zinc content of ores used directly without going through the cast metal or slab stage (118,000 metric tons), as well as the recoverable zinc content of alloys and chemical compounds pro- duced from old and new scrap, residues, etc. (271,000 metric tons). During the period charted, the four major uses of zinc appear to have been at or near their peak in 1973 (except for brass, used heavily during World War II for cartridge cases). These large applications of zinc are very sensitive to the economic cycle (note 1975 data), because zinc is important in automobile production (die-casting, galvanizing, and oxide for rubber tires) and industrial and residential construction activity (galvanizing, brass, die-casting for appliances, and oxide for paint pigments). 23 image: ------- TABLE 2-8 Total Zinc Usage in the United States Classified by Industry, at Intervals between 1935 and 1976a Metric Tons Year 1935\u00b0 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1973 1975 1976d Zinc from U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Mines. b Included in \"Other\" on Figure 2-1. a Partially estimated. d Estimated. 24 image: ------- 2,000 i\u2014 1935 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960 1965 YEAR 1970 | 1976 1973 TTTrinHT 2-1 Total zinc usage in the United States by industry at selected internals, 1935-1976? Compiled from data of U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Mines. image: ------- CHAPTER 3 NATURAL SOURCES AND DISTRIBUTION OF ZINC Zinc is a moderately abundant element; its concentration in the continental crust of the earth is generally given as 70 ppm, which would place it as twenty-fourth in abundance of the chemical elements. Zinc has ionic radii of 0.68A in fourfold coordination and 0.83A in sixfold coordination; they are close to those of magnesium, ferrous iron, and cupric copper, and these elements commonly form solid solutions with zinc in oxygen salts such as the sulfates and phosphates. Although more than 80 zinc minerals are known, only a few serve as commercial ores of the metal. The principal ores are the sulfides sphalerite and wurtzite (cubic zoO, and willemite, Za.SiO,. Zinc is present in part in igneous and metamorphic rocks as the sulfide sphalerite, but most of it present is disseminated as a minor constituent of rock-forming minerals, especially those rich in iron, such as and raetamorphic rocks are weathered, most of the zinc is concentrated in the clay minerals of the sedimentary rocks and soils formed, especially in the minerals of the montmorillonite group. ZINC IN IGNEOUS AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS Ranges of zinc content and averages for various types of igneous rocks are assembled in Table 3-1. Zinc generally is concentrated in basaltic rocks and is somewhat depleted in granitic rocks. In basaltic rocks, the content of zinc increases directly with the total iron content. Data on metamorphic rocks indicate that their contents of zinc are very similar to those of the unmetamorphosed rocks in which they were found, that is, no indication of appreciable mobilization of zinc during metamorphism has been found. ZINC IN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS Ranges of zinc content and averages for various types of sedimentary rocks are listed in Table 3-2. Zinc is concentrated notably in shales and clays; part of it is thought to be an isomorphous replacement for magnesium and iron and part may be adsorbed on the surface. The concentration is clearly higher 1627,1694 in black shales rich in organic matter, but the nature of the zinc-organic complex and the exact mechanism of its formation are not known. Zinc exhibits a two- to threefold 791 concentration in iron-rich laterites and bauxites.

Zinc is also quite concentrated in marine phosphorites, and especially high levels of zinc are reported in those from Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah.575 These high levels of zinc also are found in phosphatic fertilizers manufactured from phosphorites of this area. ZINC IN SOILS The zinc content of soils has been the subject of some review.153'938'1581'1696 Normal soils contain 10-300 ppm zinc, average about 50 ppm, and in uncontaminated areas, the contents generally are not very different from those of the parent rock. A recent study of 863 U.S. soils1 77a noted an average of 54 ppm zinc (see bar graph for Figure 3-1). Zinc contents of soils near sulfide deposits are generally higher than background; this indicator is the basis of geochemical prospecting methods widely used in exploration for ore deposits. Soils near highways may be contaminated appreciably; zinc contents of such soils891 are set forth in Table 3-3. The source of the zinc may be from wearing of tires (containing zinc oxide) and emissions from motor oil to which zinc dithiophosphite has been added; these sources of zinc are in addition to industrial emanations. Klein851 found that soil from industrial areas near Grand Rapids, Michigan, had a mean content of 56.6 ppm zinc, whereas nearby agricultural and residential areas had re- spective means of 22.1 and 21.1 ppm zinc.

The occurrence of insoluble zinc-organic matter complexes has been established, and the formation of soluble organic complexes with zinc has a pro- found effect on the mobility and availability of the metal. The soluble zinc-organic complexes can leach through the soil to influence weathering and geochemical distribution in the soil profile. Organic substances are also important in the transport and ultimate concentration of zinc and other metals in such important deposits as peat and coal. Some soluble zinc-organic complexes are so stable that the zinc is essentially unavailable to living systems, but these extremely stable complexes are rare. Therefore, the chem- istry of the zinc-organic complex in soil is closely related to the nature and magnitude of microbial and other biologic activities as well as to the level of zinc and other competing compounds present. Natural Chelating Substances in Soil Two main groups of organic compounds that form stable compounds with zinc in soil are biochemicals which exist in living organisms, and complex polymers formed by secondary synthesis reactions to form more complex products. The first group contains organic acids, peptides, proteins, and polysaccharides, and the second group contains humic and fulvic acids. The two groups cannot always be clearly separated because some biochemical compounds are bound tightly to humic materials. Zinc can function as a linkage in binding these organic compounds, and it can be chelated by them. Most of the insoluble zinc-organic complexes are associated with the humic group, especially humic acid. The most soluble and least stable zinc complexes are with individual bio- chemical compounds; but the fulvic acid complexes also have high water 1553 solubilities, yet greater stability than the biochemical complexes. 33 image: ------- Biochemical Compounds The relative susceptibility of simple biochemical compounds to microbial decomposition has often been assumed to be of little or no importance in metal reactions in soils. But recent studies show that the combined total of poten- tial chelating agents at any one time may tremendously influence the availa- 526,713 bility of zinc and other metals to plants. For example, up to 75% of the zinc in displaced soil solutions was shown to be associated with low 526,713 molecular weight, dialyzable organic constituents. Natural complexing biochemicals have also been demonstrated to be of considerable importance in 425 the transport of zinc to plant roots and its movement through the soil profile. Many organic acids (malic, citric, oxa&cetic, fumaric, a-ketoglutaric, glycine, cystine, cysteine, etc.) are the biochemical compounds of primary importance in the formation of soluble zinc complexes in soils. Other compounds that chelate zinc in soils include organic phosphates, phytic acid (inositolhexa- acid], chlorophyll porphyrins, phenolic compounds, and auxins. The con- tribution of all these other compounds to zinc-organic complexes from biochem- ical sources is minor compared to the prevalence of organic acids and free 711,1081 amino acids. Specific reactions have been reviewed in detail. 34 image: ------- Humic and Fulvic Acids The binding of zinc and other metals by humic and fulvic acids is influ- enced greatly by the nature and properties of the acids. The following differences should be noted between fulvic acid and humic acid: fulvic acid is light yellow to yellow-brown, whereas the color of humic acid ranges from dark brown to gray-black; the degree of polymerization is increased for humic acid; the molecular weight of fulvic acid is about 2,000, and the molecular weight of humic acid is about 300,000; carbon content increases from 45% in fulvic acid to 62% in humic acid; oxygen content decreases 48% in fulvic acid to 30% in humic acid; and exchange acidity decreases from 1,400 in fulvic acid to 500 1553 in humic acid. Generally, humic acid is the material extracted from soil by alkaline solutions and precipitated upon acidification, whereas fulvic acid is an alkaline-soluble 1553 material that remains soluble after acidification. Formation of stable humic and fulvic acid complexes with zinc and other metals is possible because of the high content of oxygen-containing functional groups such as carboxyl, phenol, alcohol, enol- hydroxyl, and carbon-oxygen structures. Amino and imino 1553 groups may also be important in zinc binding. Several functional 1314 groups have been identified as being involved in the binding of zinc by humic acids. Phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups having pKa values between 2.8 and 4.4 accounted for the least stable but greatest adsorbed fraction of zinc, while more stable fractions were attributed to strongly acidic carboxyl groups with pKa values below 2.0* Zinc would be more likely to be adsorbed by the more stable forms. 35 image: ------- 1314 1436 711 Randhawa and Broadbent, Schnitzer and Hodgson have suggested that humic and fulvic acid fractions of organic matter are 1314 very important in zinc adsorption. Randhawa and Broadbent found that the species of zinc complexed by the humic acid varied with pH. At pH 7.0, they concluded that 70% of the metal retained by humic acid was present as the divalent species, whereas at pH 3.6, 75% of the acid was monovalent. However, inherent errors in determining the ratio of the complexes by the ion exchange resin method may cast doubt on their conclusions. Stability constants for the zinc-humic acid complex were calculated to be 4.42 at pH 3.5, 6.18 at 1315 pH 5.6 and 6.80 at pH 7.0. 1436 Schnitzer and Skinner reported zinc-fulvic acid stability constants (Io8l0) of 1.73 at pH 3.5 and 2.34 at pH 5.0. Because bonding of metals to fulvic acid involves carboxyl groups, the' dependence of pH on the stability constants reflects the competition with hydrogen ions. Whenever possible, it would be preferable to eliminate the pH dependence on the metal-fulvic acid complexes in determining stability constants. The log K value of 5.6 at pH 7.0 for a zinc-soil-organic matter complex 705 reported indicates that most of the zinc may have been adsorbed in the form of a zinc-humic acid complex. The pH drop of the humic acids on addition of metallic cations was found Mn+2, Ni+2, Zn+2, Cu+ , Al*3, and Fe+3 in descending order. Therefore, copper, aluminum, and iron may be more tightly bound than zinc to humic acid. Zinc can be fixed through solid phase adsorption (including complexation) or the formation of insoluble precipitates. The hydrolysis (log K, \u00bb 9.7) and solubility (log <8O = -16 ) constants for zinc hydroxides indicate that these insoluble forms of zinc cannot be controlling the levels of soluble zinc in 36 image: ------- soils. Most of the zinc immobilization is attributed to surface adsorption 711 793 and complexing by organic matter. Jensen and Lamm found a high degree of correlation between zinc content and organic matter distribution in differ- ent soils. Destroying the organic matter of a surface soil allowed almost all of an extra source of zinc to be extracted with dithizone (C6H5'N:N'CS'NH*NH- CgHs) whereas only 50-75% could be recovered when organic matter was allowed to 87 remain. Thus, removing organic matter appears to decrease the immediate reactivity of zinc in soils. Although the immobilization of zinc by stabilized organic matter is well established, newly formed organic substances (especially biochemical inter- mediates and fulvic acids) are mobile and can solubilize zinc and increase the metals availability to plants and other biologic systems. Leachates from organic soils and humic layers from forest soils often contain considerable amounts of soluble organic substances during periods of high biologic activity. Hence, zinc movement and availability can be increased greatly whenever zinc- enriched sewage sludges, animal manures, and industrial wastes are added to soils. The possibility of influencing the environmental impact of added or native zinc through proper management of soil organic matter is of considerable importance because of the variety of chemical reactions that occur between zinc and organic materials. 37 image: ------- ZINC IN WATERS Most modern determinations of the zinc content of sea water are in the range of 1-27 y.g/1 zinc, with a median at about 8 Mg. 543, 1291, 1349, 1498, 1530, 1625 Jt has been estimated that about 700,000 metric tons of zinc are transported to the sea annually. More than 99.9% of the zinc reaching the sea in the dissolved form is eventually precipitated with oceanic sediments, chiefly with clay minerals, but partly with manganese oxide nodules and phosphorites . Appreciable amounts of zinc can be precipitated as sulf ide in anoxic waters , such as those that exist in parts of the Black Sea.^531 The zinc content of fresh waters is more variable, but uncontaminated fresh waters generally contain 10 yg or less zinc/1 water. The chemistry of zinc in such waters has been reviewed recently by Hem, who has compared observed concentra- tions of zinc with those calculated from thermodynamic data. Zinc carbonate or zinc orthosilicate were assumed to be solid phases. Most surface waters appear to be unsaturated by the carbonate; the equilibrium of zinc silicate may be more important. Recent analyses of filtered surface waters of the United States are summarized in Table 3-4. An earlier study869 pre- sented similar results. Zinc was detected (sensitivity 20 yg/1) in 76.5% of 1,577 samples; the maximum content reported was 1,183 yg/1, and the mean content was 64 yg/1. 38 image: ------- TABLE 3-4 a Zinc Content of Filtered Surface Waters of the U.S.- Zinc Content, ug/1 < 10 - 20 - 30 - 40 - 50 - 60 - 70 - 80 - 90 - 100 - 110 - 120 - 130 - 140 - 150 - 200 - 250 - 300 - 500 - 1,000 - 4 19,000 42,000 TOTAL 10 19 29 39 49 59 69 79 89 99 109 119 129 139 149 199 249 299 499 999 ,500 40Q No. of Samples 205 112 104 57 37 35 23 12 11 11 11 13 11 9 7 20 17 2 8 2 5 1 1 714 \u2014Data from Durum et al. 39 image: ------- High amounts of zinc in surface waters represent indus- trial and urban pollution, from such sources as zinc dissolved from galvanized pipes and the dumpings of plating baths. Streams that drain from areas of mining activity also may have 424,1068 zinc contents up to 21,000 yg/1. High amounts of zinc were found in waters of the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River (in northern Idaho) in an area where thousands of tons 1068 of ground tailings of zinc ores were exposed. Waters of such streams tend to purify themselves by pre- cipitating zinc with clay sediments or with hydrous iron and manganese oxides. Quantitative data are insufficient to permit an overall estimate of the proportion precipitated, but the 424 effect of such precipitation was shown by Elderfield et al., who found 1,000-10,000 ppm zinc (average was 3,700 ppm) in 69 sediments of the Conway River in Wales, and by Banat e al., who examined seven German rivers for zinc content, and reported highest values for the sediments of the Weser River, which contained 400-3,100 ppm zinc, with an average of 1,572 ppm. 1225 Perhac found that although the zinc content of suspended matter in two Tennessee streams was much higher than the con- centration of dissolved zinc, most of the zinc was transported as dissolved material. Zinc is picked up by water in the distribution system and household plumbing, and almost all drinking water has a de- tectable concentration of zinc. All but three of 2,500 samples 40 image: ------- of water collected at consumers' taps had more than I p% zinc/1. The survey of 969 water systems located in nine geographic areas in the U.S. reported the average zinc content of drinking water as 194 yg/1. The highest concentration detected was 13,000 vg/lf and 0.3% of the 2,595 1646 samples exceeded the drinking water standard limit of 5 mg/1. When the intakes of food and water are compared, it is found that drinking water would provide 4.3% of the average food-zinc intake in the United States. ZINC OOMTEMT OF CQKLS Although hundreds of samples of coal have been analyzed for zinc, a meaningful average content is not easy to obtain. Nearly all the available analyses were made by spectrographic analysis of the residual. ash of the coal; there is considerable danger of volatilizing part of the zinc during ashing unless special precautions are taken. Furthermore, the spectrographic method for zinc is comparatively insensitive; various 5,925,1823 workers have given their limits of detection of zinc as 50 to 200 ppm zinc in the ash. As indicated in Table 3-5, a substantial per- centage of the analyses report zinc as \"not found.\" Because all such determinations were calculated as zero, all averages given are minimal figures. No attempt has been made to average all the data reported. Tables 3-5 and 3-6 give data based on reports in which analyses are given of a substantial number of samples, and in which the percentage of ash was given, so that results could be calculated back to the zinc content of the 289 coal proper. Earlier data have been reviewed by Clarke and Swain and 4 by Abernethy and Gibson. 41 image: ------- 10 TABLE 3-5 Zinc Content of Coals of the tftiited States, by Regions Area b Eastern province- Appalachian region- . b Interior province\u2014 b Western states- Western region^ Northern Great Plains- No, of Samples 600 378 123 475 104 44 221 Average Zinc in a Coal, ppiu 21.4 8.2 78.0 44.0 25.3 28.0 59.0 No. of Samples Reporting \"Not Pound\" - 296 - 260 - - 199 TOTAL 1,945 AVERAGE 32.6 =In these calculations, \"not found\" was calculated as zero; the averages are therefore all minimal figures. 5 ^Derived from Abernethy et al. ^Derived from Zubovic et al. ^Derived from Zubovic et al. ^Derived from Zubovic et from Zubovic et al. image: ------- TABIE 3-6 Zinc Content of Coals from Major Dcxxmtentation APRS b.c Alabama\u2014 \u2014 Arkansas- fa Scotia- No, of Samples ~ii^^_jab^ij__M_^^ 137 67 40 319 82 123 25 198 208 93 117 40 23 51 938 494 182 Average Zinc in a Coal, pptr- 9.7 7.2 33.0 141.0 313.0 149.0 25.0 a ~When zinc was not found, it was calculated as zero; the averages, are therefore all minimal figures. ^Derived from Abemethy et al. 0\u00ab_ . . ^Derived from from Zubovic et al. from from Ruch et al. 43 image: ------- The average content of zinc in U.S. coals given in Table 3-5 (32.6 107 ppm) is of the same order of magnitude as other recent estimates: 50 ppm, 1816 1016 20 ppm for hard coal, and 60 ppm for brown coal. The last two estimates were based on a survey of world literature, weighed according to the total estimated reserves in each area. The nature of the bonding of zinc in coal has been discussed by 1821a 1382a Zubovic and Ruch et al. There are notable areal variations in the proportion of zinc bound to the organic and to the inorganic con- stituents of coal, but a large proportion of the zinc is bound to inorganic constituents, and especially to the occurrence of sphalerite. Data on zinc content of petroleum are scarce. A recent estimate for 107 oil was 0.25 ppm, and an average of 4.2 ppm zinc was given for 3 resid- 369 ual heating oils. 44 image: ------- CHAPTER 4 MAN-MADE SOURCES OF ZINC MINING AND CONCENTRATING There are over 30 mines and smelters where zinc is mined and produced in the United States. Primary areas of zinc production are mapped in Figure 4-1 and the specific locations are listed in Table 4-1. Zinc ore, primarily sphalerite, ZnS, is mined by conventional under- ground mining methods, then crushed in mills, and concentrated by dif- ferential flotation. The choice of concentration techniques depends upon the chemical composition of the zinc compounds and also the other con- stituents (e.g., lead, copper, iron) in the ore. Losses of zinc to the atmosphere from mining, milling, and concentrating are comparatively small, but some do occur during blasting, ore handling, crushing, and wind loss from tailings. During grinding and flotation, the ore is wet and atmospheric emissions are small. It has been estimated that zinc emissions to the 369 atmosphere from mining and milling are 0.1 kg/metric ton of zinc mined. Based on the 1973 total of 435,318 metric tons for U.S. mine production of zinc, the total zinc emissions to the atmosphere from mining and milling would have 1644 a been 43.5 metric tons. However, mining and milling, including flotation, can be an important source of water-borne zinc, whenever water pumped from the mine is utilized in the concentrating process. Figure 4-2 is a flow diagram of mining and milling waste water from a lead-zinc mine in Missouri, and Table 4-2 shows the concentrations of zinc found at various stages along 1796 that path. 45 image: ------- PRIMARY ZINC PRODUCTION AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES FIGURE M\u20141 Primary zinc production areas in the United States.

Mill discharged through tailings direct to stream during construction of new lagoons. 50 image: ------- Wixson and Bolter hold that the differences between the final stream concentrations of zinc in the early and present mining situations were caused by reduced retention time in recent years as the lagoons filled up with tailings. However, the data in Table 4-2 indicate that the concen- tration of zinc in the mill water, the point furthest up the waste stream sampled, may be the determining factor of the eventual discharge concen- tration. It also was noted that the zinc content of the streams returned to baseline levels within a few miles of the source. A study of the Coeur d'Alene River system in northern Idaho confirmed that nonferrous metals mining and related activities can result in high concentrations of zinc in waters that receive effluents. ^^ Zinc concen- trations during low volume flow ranged from less than 0.1 mg/1 for the North Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River, which has little mining activity, to 21.0 mg/1 at a station in the South Fork, which has considerable mining activity. Concentrations of zinc in the South Fork were generally between 1-2 mg/1; in the main stream the concentrations of zinc were between 2-5 mg/1. 51 image: ------- Although mining and concentrating activities are only minor sources of zinc to the atmosphere, such activities can cause significant quantities of zinc to be discharged into waterways. It should be noted that sedimentation may cause concentrations of zinc in steams receiving effluent from mining and concentrating activities to be reduced with distance downstream from the point of discharge.1676 SMELTING AND METALLURGIC OPERATIONS Primary Zinc Production There are three basic types of primary zinc smelters in the United States: horizontal-retort distillation units, vertical-retort distillation units, and electrolytic plants. Regardless of the type of smelting process zinc may be released into the air during concentrate handling, open storage, and conveying. In each of these smelting processes, the concentrated zinc ore must go through a roasting procedure to drive off sulfur dioxide, SOo, and convert the zinc sulfide, ZnS, to zinc oxide, ZnO, Roasting may create large amounts of dust, but because that operation is enclosed, the dust may be readily collected. The horizontal-retort distillation units are essentially batch processes in which a roasted concentrate and coke mixture are heated in a retort to approximately 1,100 C; natural gas is the usual fuel. Zinc is then reduced from the roast (zinc oxide) to zinc metal in vapor form. The zinc vapor passes into a condenser where it condenses into a liquid; it is then drained off at intervals into molds. 52 image: ------- The vertical-retort distillation process produces highly pure zinc con- tinuously. The basic process is essentially the same as for the horizontal- retort process, except that the charge, consisting of briquettes of zinc ore concentrate and coke, is fed into a charge column, which is a vertical extension of the retort. The charge moves down through a combustion zone where zinc vapor, carbon monoxide., and particulates are evolved. The gases pass out through the top of the column into a condenser, where the zinc vapor is condensed into zinc metal. The electrolytic process is quite different from the other two systems. After the ore concentrate is roasted, the concentrate is leached with sulfuric acid to form a zinc sulfate solution. The liquid is then pumped into electrolytic cells where the zinc deposits on aluminum cathode. The cathodes are removed periodically and the zinc is stripped off. The use of particulate collecting devices, primarily baghouses and electrostatic precipitators, is highly efficient (> 95%) in recovering zinc particulates. However, some emission sources are uncontrolled and little control is exercised over emissions associated with concentrate unloading, handling, and storage.3\" The particle size of zinc emissions (composed of zinc oxide and sulfur complexes) from the retort of a horizontal-retort operation were as follows: 34% of the particles were 2.5 ym in diameter, 35% were 2.5-5.0 ym, and 31% were greater than 5.0 ym.-'69 Other estimates, however, have indicated smaller particle sizes. The particle size for zinc fume has been estimated at 0.01-0.3 ym in diameter and metallurgic dust and fumes at 0.001-100 ym in diameter.317 Few quantitative data exist on the concentration of airborne zinc near primary zinc smelters in the United States. Schrenk ejt al, estimated that the total pollution load of zinc oxide from a zinc smelter involved in the air pollution episode in Donora, Pennsylvania in 1948 was 11,068 kg 53 image: ------- zinc oxide/day. Another study of two vertical-retort zinc plants estimated 198 that the daily emissions of zinc since 1960 ranged from 6,000-9,000 kg. However, particulate control systems can remove 99.5% of the particulate matter.1238 Based on conditions existing in 1969, the following estimates for emission factors for the three types of zinc processes were made: horizontal-retort smelting created 77 kg zinc emissions/metric tons zinc produced; vertical-retort smelting released 36 kg zinc emissions/metric tons zinc produced; and the electrolytic 369 process produced 27 kg zinc emissions for every metric tons zinc. The study also estimated that primary zinc smelting activity accounted for the discharge of 45,454 metric tons of zinc into the atmosphere in 1969. Since 1969, however, five zinc smelters in the United States have ceased operations, thereby reducing the zinc-producing capacity of the United States, as well as the total emissions of zinc to the atmosphere. ^\"^ Although data are not available on the concentration of zinc in the air near zinc smelters, soil analyses are available. Table 4-3, which summarizes the zinc content of soils near three smelters, shows that concentrations are much higher than the average 50-54 ppm found in normal soils. Although most of the zinc is in the top few centimeters of soil, there is appreciable downward movement, as shown by the data in Table 4-4. Great contamination has been shown in the upper 15 cm of the soil 1 QQ profile near a zinc smelter. \u00b0 The range of zinc content of soil within 1 km of the plant was 50,000-80,000 ppm zinc in the soil. Organic matter in the same area contained as much as 135,000 ppm of zinc. It has been estimated that the zinc deposition rate in this area was 1.75-5.25 ^ g/mj/month, or approximately 207-621 kg/ha/yr. The concentration of zinc in soil fell off sharply with distance from the plant. Background levels* of zinc were found The level of zinc normally found in the soil if there has been no contamination from any metallurgic operation. 54 image: ------- Location Swansea, W.

However, the concentrations of zinc in soil noted above are the consequences of metallurgic operations dating back to 1898. The installation of control equipment and improved control technology should mean that the area near the smelter now receives contamination at a much lower rate than in the past. The potential waste waters from electrolytic refining are spent electrolyte solutions and slurries formed by removing impurities in the electrolyte solution by precipitating them in thickeners. According to Tallmadge, little or no zinc appears in waste water, as spent electrolyte solutions, and supernatant liquids 1594 from slurries are usually recycled for re-use in the leaching step. A survey of lead-zinc smelting and refining operations in the United States 606a has shown that waste waters can have zinc concentrations ranging from 0.01-25 mg/1. Tables 4-5 and 4-6 list the composition of waste waters from these processes. By comparison, a 1970 survey of surface waters in the United States indicated that most waters contained less than 0.05 mg/1; some exceeded 5.0 mg/1, and the highest value was 42 mg/l.1116a Another important primary source of zinc\u2014accounting for 68,471 metric tons of zinc in 1972^\u00b0a\u2014is zinc oxide from fuming furnaces. Zinc is recovered from lead blast furnace slag by heating the slag to high temperatures and blowing coal and air through it. Zinc is reduced, volatilized, reoxidized, and then collected as zinc oxide in bag filter units. Information is not available on the quantity of zinc emitted to the atmosphere during zinc fuming operations. However, the efficiency of the collecting units probably determines the magnitude of zinc arising from fuming furnaces. One survey of a fuming operation found the particulate emissions to be negligible because of the efficient collection by a baghouse unit.1646a Because zinc is a constituent in other ores and raw materials, zinc dusts and fumes may be produced when other metals are refined or produced, primarily lead, copper, and steel. Athanassiadis has reported that considerable quantities of 57 image: ------- TABLE 4-5 Composition of Waste Waters and Receiving Streams in Lead-Zinc Metallurgic Processes for Lead Smelters and Refineries, mg/1 Upstream pH 7.6-8.1 Arsenic 0 . 11 Cadmium 0 . 002 Copper 0 . 13 Iron Manganese \u2014 tn Nickel \u2014 oo Lead 0.03 Zinc 0.08-0.43 Plant Water 7.2 5.0 \u2014 \u2014 7.7 0.06 5.0 7.4 0.9 0.7 0.2 0.5 8.0 126 960 Other Waste Water 8.6 \u2014 0.5 4.0 1.3 0.5 0.06 11.0 2.0 200 606a from Hallowell al.

Average airborne zinc concentrations in four communities with steel-producing plants have been reported in Table 4-7.1590 Concentrations during and after strikes demonstrate the impact of the industrial activity on the zinc content of the air. Therefore, primary production of zinc and other metals may release zinc into the environment. These contributions are appreciably reduced by dust and fume control equipment and by water pollution control systems. How- ever, even in situations under little control, the emission of zinc into the environment is likely to be confined to a limited area near the smelter. Secondary Zinc Production Secondary or recycled zinc is an important source of zinc in the United States. In 1972, 438,150 metric tons of recoverable zinc were produced by American mines. In addition, 83,736 metric tons of secondary zinc were produced, nearly 19% of the total U.S. zinc production. Zinc scrap materials are composed of metallic scrap and residual scrap materials (skimmings, residues, and drosses from metallic baths). Because these materials differ considerably in zinc content and form, several differ- ent processes are employed to reclaim the metal. Scrap brass and bronze are also recovered by remelting. Bronze contains little zinc and is poured at temperatures substantially below the boiling point of bronze. Brass, however, contains 15-40% zinc and is poured at a temperature near the boiling point of brass. Therefore, major zinc emissions may occur from brass remelting operations.-^9 Analysis of various brass smelter flue dust samples indicated zinc concentrations of 47.0-70.4%, when approximately 0.9-1.8 metric tons of flue dust were collected daily.512a>1269a 60 image: ------- TABLE 4-7 Zinc Concentrations in Air During and After Steel Industry Strikes a in Four Communities in the U.S. (1956) and Corresponding Probability Levels Average Concentrations, yg/m-* No. of , Community After Strike Strike Difference Samples Probability^ Birmingham, Ala. 700 200 500 9 0.028 Donora, Pa.C 11,800 100 11,700 15 < 0.001 East Chicago, Ind. 1,600 300 1,300 9 0.002 Allegheny County, Pa. 1,100 100 1,000 8 0.009 1590 from Tabor and Meeker. ^Probability of obtaining the observed differences by chance alone; the limit of statistical significance is p=0.05. cThe only community with a zinc plant (closed during the strike) . 61 image: ------- Zinc scrap materials are sorted and sometimes pretreated to drive off moisture, oil, and other organic impurities. After pretreatment, the scrap zinc-bearing material is sweated and/or distilled. In sweat processing, heat is applied to scrap materials to melt the metal. A flux may or may not be used. A molten-metal bath is formed from the metallic zinc and dissolved alloy metals. The molten metal may then be cast directly into blocks for subsequent further processing, fed directly to a distillation furnace, or cast into ingots to specifications. The distillation process is similar to the distillation systems used in primary zinc production. Either a retort or a muffle furnace is used, each equipped with condensers.\"\u00b0\u00b0 The principal source of airborne zinc emissions in secondary zinc process- ing occurs from vaporization of the metal in melting and pouring, and through escape of zinc fume from the sweating and distillation processes. It has been 0Q estimated00 that zinc emissions to the atmosphere vary from 5 g-62 kg/metric tons of products, averaging 9 kg/t. The total zinc emissions to the atmosphere 369 came to 3,455 metric tons in 1969. Although the amount of secondary zinc seems small when compared to emissions from primary zinc production (45,455 metric tons in 1969), as secondary zinc evolves as a more important source of the metal, its contribution to total zinc emissions will increase. Zinc Oxide Production Zinc oxide is used extensively in industry. In 1974, 228,356 metric tons of zinc oxide were produced in the U.S. and used for many purposes, the most important being in the production of rubber.135^a Zinc oxide may be produced chemically, or by direct or indirect pyrometallurgic means. As mentioned, in the direct (American) process, zinc vapor is produced from ore or scrap and 62 image: ------- then oxidized to form zinc oxide. The indirect (French) process uses zinc metal, which first is vaporized and then oxidized to form zinc oxide. One survey has indicated that zinc emissions to the atmosphere during the produc- tion of zinc oxide in 1969 ranged from 9-85 kg zinc/metric ton of product. It was estimated that in 1969 emissions from zinc oxide production totalled 7,330 metric tons.369 Manufacturing and Fabricating The major end uses of slab or metallic zinc are galvanizing, manufacturing brass products, and die-casting alloys. During galvanizing, zinc is primarily released into the atmosphere when ammonium chloride flux is added or when the flux layer over the hot zinc bath is disturbed. Brass is a copper alloy containing up to 40% zinc. Bronze contains a much smaller percentage of zinc. During processing of both products, the metals are melted together and poured at elevated temperatures (649-1,316 C). Zinc fume is released to the atmosphere during heating and pouring. Similarly, when zinc die-castings are produced, the zinc alloys are melted and poured into 369 dies and then cast into the desired forms. Table 4-8 lists the amounts and sources of zinc emissions into the atmosphere from manufacturing and fabricating. Industrial operations using zinc contribute to the zinc content of streams into which waste water flows, of course, but few quantitative data exist from individual sources. ZINC IN THE COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT Available data on air levels of zinc in urban communities without mines 54 or smelters indicate a general decline in airborne zinc from 1954 through 1964. 914a Lee and Lehmden report concentrations of zinc particulates in urban areas 63 image: ------- TABLE 4-8 Airborne Emissions from End Uses of Zinc' a Use Zinc-based alloys Zinc-coating Brass and bronze Rubber tires Photocopying Paint Zinc sulfate Miscellaneous Major Source of Emission Melting Molten zinc baths Melting Abrasion Waste disposal (burning) Production Production Emissions,, metric ton/yr (1969^ 2,727 864 164 7,836 1,364 9 27 1,000 369 Adapted from Davis. 64 image: ------- throughout the U.S. ranging from 0.1-1.7 pg/m3, and data from the National Air Sampling Network have recorded annual average airborne zinc concentrations that i645a throughout the U.S. /are generally less than 1 ug/m3, as shown by Table 4-9. *y Motor vehicles , fuel oil and coal combustion, incineration, soil erosion, and industrial, commercial, and construction activities contribute to zinc in urban atmospheres. Estimates have been made of the amounts of zinc released into the urban atmosphere by these activities and products. For example, tire wear and leakage and combustion of fuels and lubricants containing zinc additives account for most of the zinc released by motor vehicles. Rubber tires contain 1.5% zinc by weight jH72a according to Davis, 3<^ ztnc wears off rubber tires at a rate of 45 g zinc/tire/yr, or 1.2 kg zinc/million km. Fuel and lubricating oils contain 30-1,500 ppm zinc;^72a the zinc arising from motor vehicle emissions is preferentially attached to small (submicron) particles in amounts of 0.1-10 ppm.^l^a The amount of zinc contributed from motor vehicles appears to vary from city to city. Gordon, in College Park, Md.t and Fried lander, in Los Angeles, reported that the fraction of zinc in the atmosphere accounted for by motor vehicles wae 23% and 22%, respectively. 72a However, Creuson et_ al.335 found that neither site differences, distances, nor depth gradient effects were significant for dust fall zinc when comparing samples representative of various Industrial and urban patterns collected from roadside sites in Cincinnati. Ondov lt aJL, H72a compared zinc: lead ratios for urban area roads and a tunnel, which provided a system for accurate measurement of background air. Sample! from the tunnel gave a zinc: lead ratio of 1:100, whereas the urban areas had a zinc: lead ratio of 1.10(0.25; hence, motor vehicles account for only a small percentage of the zinc observed in city air. Moreover, they are not the major source of zinc on suspended particles in urban atmospheres. 65 image: ------- TABLE 4-9 Urban Air Samples and Yearly Zinc Averages, yg/m3 \u2014 Birmingham, Alabama Paradise Valley, Arizona Texarkana, Arkansas Bakersfield, California Bridgeport, Connecticut Atlanta, Georgia Boise, Idaho Moline, Illinois Beverly Shores, Indiana Dubuque, Iowa Ashland, Kentucky 1.09 Baltimore, Maryland .34 .05 Brockton, Massachusetts .11 <.01 Kalamazoo, Michigan .04 <.01 Moorhead, Minnesota <.01 1.60 Lincoln, Nebraska .50 .52 Bridgeton, New Jersey .08 <.01 Albuquerque, New Mexico <.01 <.01 Akron, Ohio .48 .20 Altoona, Pennsylvania .27 <.01 Baymon, Puerto Rico <.01 .54 Portsmouth, Virginia .08 ^Adapted from the National Air Sampling Network. 1645a 66 image: ------- Fuel oil is used in homes for heating and by industries, electric utility companies, railroads, oil companies, and the military. Based on an average zinc content of 4.17 ppm for fuel oil, Davis369 has calculated a zinc emission factor for fuel oil of 0.64 kg zinc/1,000 barrels of oil burned. In the U.S. in 1969, combustion of fuel oil accounted for 410 metric tons of zinc emitted to the atmosphere, or approximately 0.28% of total zinc emissions. The probable forms of the zinc particles in the flue gas are zinc oxide and zinc sulfate.860a Davis369 also provides estimates for zinc emissions contributed by burn- ing coal. The average zinc content of various U.S. coals is 54.6 ppm (see Chapter 3). Based on U.S. figures for 1969, the calculated zinc emission factor for burning coal is 8.5 kg zinc/1,000 metric tons of coal burned. This means that an estimated 3,922 metric tons of zinc were emitted, that is, 2.7% of the total zinc emissions from milling and nonmining sources. Most of the zinc is discharged with the airborne fly ash.^^Oa Small but significant amounts of zinc are released during incineration. otq DavisJ y calculated that 25,435 metric tons of zinc, or 17.5% of total zinc emissions, were emitted into the atmosphere in the U.S. in 1969 from incinerations. This estimate is based on an average zinc content of about 2,400 ppm a in sewage, sludge, and 23,842 metric tons of refuse and garbage that were ultimately incinerated. Much of the zinc particulate material released into urban atmospheres from all of these sources settles on pavements as \"fallout\" and is washed into natural and man-made drainage systems as rainfall runoff. A study of runoff from street surfaces following a moderate-to-heavy storm in seven cities revealed zinc values ranging from a low of 0.03 kg/curb mi to a high 67 image: ------- of 0.95 kg/curb mi, with an average of 0.34 kg/curb mi (see Table 4-10).1414a The zinc was of no particular size or particle range, and it was one of the metals present in the greatest amount in the runoff, regardless of land use category (see Table 4-11). Zinc loading intensities were heaviest in indus- trial areas and lightest in commercial areas (see Figure 4-3).' However, such distinctions disappear when the contribution of zinc is considered in terms of percent by weight of total solids, that is, pounds (grams) of metal per 100 pounds (kilograms) of dry solids, as shown in Figure 4-4. Drinking water samples from throughout the United States indicate that despite the contribution of airborne zinc to water systems as fallout or in precipitation, the drinking water standard of 5 mg/1 was exceeded on the average in only one of 969 water systems tested. Of a total of 2,595 distri- bution samples, the 5 mg/1 standard was exceeded in 8 cases, or 0.3%. The 1646 maximum zinc concentration found was 13 ppm. Available data indicate that significant zinc contamination of the environment in specific limited areas near point sources exists. However, there do not seem to be major mobile sources of zinc nor does zinc appear to be an increasing environmental contaminant. ZINC USES AND MARKETS Zinc consumption in the United States during the 1960fs and on into the 1970's has averaged over 1,183,000 metric tons/yr, making zinc the fourth most used metal after steel, aluminum, and copper. The consumption rate is high because of the wide availability and advantageous properties of zinc. Consumption of zinc is sensitive to economic cycles, particularly because the metal is mostly used in automobile production (for die-casting, 68 image: ------- TABLE 4-10 Concentrations of Zinc in Runoffs from Street Surfaces City San Jose - I San Jose - Ii Phoenix Milwaukee Baltimore Atlanta Tulsa Seattle Zinc Loading Intensity, kg/curb mi 0.63 0,13' 0.16 0.95 0.59 0.05 0.03 0.17 Average 0.34 1414a Derived from Sartor and Boyd. \"San Jose was tested twice, once in December 1970 and again in June 1971; other cities were tested in the summer of 1971. 69 image: ------- TABLE 4-H Distribution of Heavy Metals by Land Use Category from Metal Chromium Copper Zinc Nickel Mercury Lead Cadmium Street Surface Residential 5 10 38 1 10 36 _LMB Contaminants , Industrial 8 14 44 5 4 25 __ % by Weighta Commercial 5 20 24 3 20 28 \u2014 _ Total 7 11 40 3 4 35 ^v 100% 100% 100% 100% a 1414a Derived from Sartor Boyd.

This sensitivity can be observed by noting the recent change in the consumption pattern for zinc in the United States. Since the 1960's, die-casting alloys accounted for the largest consumption of zinc, galvanizing has been second, and brass a distant third. These patterns of consumption are charted in Figure 4-5. In 1974, however, the U.S. consumption of zinc for die-casting alloys dropped to a level below that for galvanizing. Because of anticipated growth in the galvanizing markets and a probable lower growth rate in zinc die- casting, consumption of zinc for die-casting is likely to remain at a lower level (personal communication, T. F. Shaffer, Zinc Institute, Inc.). Consump- tion patterns vary throughout the world, but in general, galvanizing is the leading market, especially in Japan and Australia, where zinc consumed for galvanizing surpasses all other zinc markets combined. In Europe, galvanizing is also the leading zinc market in all countries except the United Kingdom, where brass is the largest single consumer of zinc. 73 image: ------- 1400 1925 FIGURE 4-5 Consumption of slab zinc in the United States. Reproduced from the annual review of the U.S. zinc industry.13543 74 image: ------- Zinc Die-Casting For many years, zinc alloys have been the most widely used metal in die- casting, because of their combination of favorable properties, adaptability to the process, and low cost. The low melting point of zinc also preserves the life of the dies longer. It has been estimated that over 455,000 metric tons of zinc were used in 1974 by die-casters in the United States.1354a The metal is used in major appli- ances and automobiles for functional parts like pumps, impellers, carburetors, and housings. It is also employed for decorative door handles, trim, frames, and control panels. Toys, hardware, plumbing fixtures, and industrial com- ponents are other major markets for zinc die castings. The development of ILZRO 12, a general foundry zinc alloy, in the late 1960's has opened new casting markets for zinc. Components previously cast in iron, copper-base, or some aluminum alloys are now being produced with this zinc alloy. New die-casting techniques developed in the early 1970's have made it possible for conventional zinc castings to be made with cross sections only about half as thick as those made in previous years. Thus, material costs and weight of the product are reduced, yet its tensile, fatigue and impact strengths are retained or even improved. rlention of this product does not imply any endorsement or recommendation by the National Academy of Sciences or the National Research Council. 75 image: ------- Wrought Zinc Depending on the ultimate product requirements, numerous \"compositions and alloys are used for wrought zinc applications. Various alloying metals are used to improve various properties (such as stiffness and creep resistance*) for specific applications. The conventional grades of slab or ingot zinc are rolled into sheet, strip, ribbon, foil, plates, or rod according to their uses. For instance, dry cell battery cases, are made from wrought zinc rolled into a strip. The zinc also may be continuous cast into rod or bar. Because of its properties, rolled zinc is easily workable into various shapes and forms by common fabri- cating methods, such as stamping, forming, and spinning. It may be polished, plated, painted, or left to weather naturally. Major markets for wrought zinc include the electrical and electronics industries, which make products such as brackets, shielding, capacitor cans, and heat sinks; general manufacturing, for products like drawer knobs, bezels, and golf club sole plates; the jewelry industry for medallions, jewelry, and buckles; and construction, for flashing, trim, and decorative panels. Galvanizing One of the oldest functions of zinc has been as a protective coating on steel to prevent rusting and its ultimate destruction. It is estimated that over 450,000 metric tons of zinc were consumed in the U.S. in 1974 for coating of *Creep resistance is the ability of metal to resist elongation over long periods of time under sustained loading stress. See also Chapter 2. + Continuous casting is a process for converting molten zinc directly into rods without interruption by casting the metal between two counter-rotating steel wheels with V-slots on their faces. 76 image: ------- Continued improvements in the galvanizing process and related areas have increased consumption totals markedly for conventional applications. In the late 1930's, for example, the introduction of the continuous hot-dip galvanizing line led to wide installation of such lines around the world, turning out millions of tons of galvanized sheet and strip. But the traditional method of dipping a steel product into a bath of molten zinc is still very much in use, particularly for prefabricated and very large parts. Over the years, galvanizing has proved effective in protecting such steel products as bridges, railroads, automotive vehicles, ships, wire, cable, pipe, hardware, containers, trash cans, and roofing. Although hot-dip galvanizing is the most popular method for protecting steel against corrosion, metallic zinc can be applied to steel in several other ways: by electrodeposition, metallizing or spraying of molten metal, sherardizing, and painting. The all-galvanized bridge became a reality in the late 1960fs when it was demonstrated that galvanized bolted connections were technically and economically feasible.31a The use of galvanized steel reinforcement for concrete also became widely accepted then. Galvanized steel reinforcements are integral parts of major governmental and institutional buildings, office buildings, bridges and roads, chemical plants, storage tanks, and other build- ings where prevention of concrete spalling or rust staining from black steel reinforcement is necessary. Zinc-rich paint has become one of the fastest growing new markets for zinc in the past few years. Such paints are most often used to supplement galvanized steel for automotive underbody protection against corrosion, for 77 image: ------- bridges and other structures, for ship hulls, and for various buildings. Zinc- rich paint provides sacrificial galvanic protection of steel similar to that of galvanized coatings and is recommended whenever economics or size and shape of products make conventional galvanizing impractical. \u00bb Large-scale applied research in the early 1960's on whether zinc anode systems should be used for marine tankers showed zinc to be superior to mag- nesium anodes in performance and economy. That zinc does not spark was a significant advantage, and now zinc anodes are the preferred sacrifical anode for protection against corrosion in this application. Related research led to a later development of zinc anode systems for galvanized hot water storage and glass-lined tanks, which provided superior service life at an economic price. Protective zinc anodes also were developed for crab pots. a ZincChemicals Zinc and its compounds are used more and more in the chemical-metallurgic, ceramic, fertilizer, paint, paper, plastics, rubber, textile, and electronics industries. As mentioned, zinc oxide is the most important zinc chemical; it is employed primarily as a reinforcing pigment in rubber, where it provides good heat conductivity and resistance to aging by sunlight. Zinc oxide is a necessary substance for the copying industry, where it is used as a thin electrostatic coating material. Although only a micron-thick layer of zinc is applied when used, the zinc oxide consumed by the copying industry has been estimated to be around 33,000 metric tons in 1972. Recently, zinc has become a supplement in plant and animal feed. Trace amounts of zinc are essential for the growth and development of plants and animals, and this essentiality will be discussed in Chapters 5, 6, and 8. 78 image: ------- WASTE DISPOSAL Tailings Tailings are the gangue and other refuse material left over from the washing, concentration, or treatment of ground ore. Tailings from the processing of zinc and lead ores may include considerable amounts of zinc, as well as sulfates, chlorides, copper, iron, lead, cadmium, arsenic, and selenium. These tailings are dissolved or suspended in process waste waters which have come into direct contact with raw materials and intermediate or final products or by-products. Table 4-12 shows some of the concentrations of metals contained in waste water discharge streams.1643 Most major waste water streams from processing plants contain sulfuric acid as well as trace metals. Addition of a lime slurry to the water raises the pH from around 2 to between 10 and 11.5, causing precipitation of several of the metals as hydroxides. The water is channeled through an enclosed system to a settling pond where the suspended solids settle; absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere leads to formation of carbonates, gradually re- ducing the pH of the pond. The effluent which evolves contains less than 10 mg/1 of total suspended solids.1\u00b0^3 Table 4-13 shows typical concentrations of various constituents from a lime and settle treatment plant. Waste water is often cycloned before liming and settling. As the water passes through cyclone pumps, coarse sand is separated from finer material. The coarse sand is used to build the retaining walls of the disposal dams; the fine material is dumped into the lagoon with the mine water or other waste stream water and left to settle. Waste water from flotation concentrators, thickeners, and zinc scavenging circuits is treated by cycloning and then allowed to settle. Cooling water from metal casting operations is usually just settled, whereas acid-plant blowdown can be treated in several ways: 79 image: ------- TABLE 4-12 Gross Concentrations 1643 Data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The Akita zinc smelter in Japan, designed with zero pollution emission as a primary goal, treats its waste waters by using a two-stage neutralization with ground limestone* CaCO,, and calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, followed by settling. The final discharge water from such treatment has a zinc content of 0.5 ppm or less. Table 4-14 QOQ compares the efficiencies of various methods which remove zinc from effluents. JJ The clarified water that remains in tailings ponds after settling occurs is left to evaporate, to percolate through the bed of the pond and underlying soil, or to be diluted by rain and snow before being decanted and released to the natural watershed. Or, it will be discharged directly to the watershed if the concentrations of trace contaminants are low enough. Few specific data are available on the concentrations of zinc contributed to ground water from water percolating through the beds of tailings ponds. Concentrations of zinc in the natural waters of zinc mining areas have been found as high as 50 mg/1, although in most ground and surface fresh water, zinc is present only in trace amounts. 1434 A median value of 20yig/l has been reported in the surface waters of the United States. ^ Studies of the translocation of zinc in soils demonstrated the relative immobility of zinc added to sandy soils, even at pH 4.^90 Similarly, Wheatland and Borne, applying river water to soils of the Bunter Sandstone area of England, found the concentration of zinc in the percolate to be considerably less than the concentration in the water applied (see Table 4-15). 82 image: ------- TABLE 4-14 Treatment Processes for Removal of Zinc Possible Effluent Concentration after Treatment Processes Treatment, mg/1 CPa (with lime) + Sd 0.5-2.5 CP\u00b0 (with lime) + Sd + F6 0.1-0.3 CP\u00b0 (with lime) + Sd + Rf/ + Fe + AC^ 0.4 o, 933 Data from Lin and Lawson. b Treatment efficiencies vary according to initial concentrations of raw wastes. ^Chemical precipitation.

Lehman and Wilson observed similar results, using suburban residential sewage effluent filtered through sandy soil material. When lysimeter columns were intermittently treated with effluent, less translocation of trace metals occurred than when the columns were treated by continuous flooding. The tests performed on both field plots and lysimeter columns proved that: zinc was present in approximately the same amounts in both studies; concentrations of zinc at the 15- and 30- cm depths of the field site were nearly the same as the concentrations at comparable depths of the continuously flooded lysimeter columns; in the lysimeter study, zinc was removed from the applied effluent at or near the soil surface, and only minor amounts of zinc were detected in the filtrates; and some zinc was translocated when filtration rates were high, as during the first few weeks of irrigation and when the Q1 O soil was saturated. \u00b0 85 image: ------- Sewage Zinc is one of the trace elements found in highest concentration in municipal waste waters. Depending upon the treatment process utilized, the zinc in waste water will be separated into effluent and sludge. On a concen- tration basis, the sewage sludge is usually enriched, whereas the effluent is lower in zinc than the incoming waste water. Even though effluents may be relatively low in zinc content, the great amounts of effluent which are dis- charged at larger sewage treatment plants can be responsible for discharging significant portions of zinc to receiving streams, irrigation sites or other effluent-receiving systems. The zinc concentration permitted in industrial effluents is regulated by discharge limits, so the metal is removed from contaminated industrial waste waters and often forms industrial sludges which are highly contaminated by zinc as well as other metals. These sludges are usually disposed of by landfill, but some are incinerated. Pound and Crites^^SSa have listed effluent concentrations of zinc measured from differing stages and types of sewage treatment in California. The values given for primary effluent were 0.83 ppm zinc, trickling filter effluent, 0.16 ppm zinc, activated sludge effluent, 0.32 ppm zinc, and pond effluent, 0.39 ppm zinc. These data are based on limited samples, but Blakeslee*23a nas presented data on effluents ranging from 0.01 to 4.7 ppm zinc in a survey of 58 sewage treatment plants in Michigan. However, most effluent values for zinc are well below 1.0 ppm, and a value of less than 0.5 ppm zinc has been cited as typical, '\"a when sanitary and storm sewers are combined, the addition of zinc to sewage by fallout of zinc particulate material onto urban pavements is significant (see Figure 4-3 and Table 4-9). Therefore, many loading factors of zinc must be considered, and the zinc concentration in the effluent from a single treatment plant may vary greatly, depending on water use and amount of zinc received. 86 image: ------- If all sewage were treated to meet secondary treatment requirements set by the EPA, about 8.1 million dry metric tons of digested sludge would be produced in the U.S. each year; the current amount is about 4.5 million dry metric tons (personal communication, R. Bastion). Because of the variation in wastes arriving at the sewage treatment plants, the sludges range widely in zinc concentrations. Many municipalities have industries that produce waste water high in zinc and more than 98% of it is segregated into sewage sludge. Sludge zinc concentration increases during anaerobic sludge digestion, because unstable organic components are lost and zinc forms an increasing percentage of the remaining material. Therefore, the zinc is effectively concentrated on a dry-weight basis. 2S6 Chaney has found zinc concentrations in digested sewage sludge ranging from 500 to 50,000 ppm. Dean and Smith3713 have shown that the distribution of zinc values in sludges tend to be logarithmically normal: some extremely high values are traceable to industrial effluents. A geometric mean gleaned from over 100 studies was 2,420 ppm zinc, and 80 additional samples from sewage treatment plants in the U.S. yielded a geometric mean of 6,380 ppm zinc.371a Berrow and Webber have described the composition of British sludges and the range of values for the 42 sludges sampled was 700 to 49,000 ppm zinc, with a mean value of 4,100 and a median value of 3,000 ppm. By comparison, normal values for zinc in 283 soils range from 10 to 300 ppm with a typical level of 80 ppm. Swedish workers have reported a mean value of 2,800 ppm zinc in 1968 and 1969 and 11 'JR 2,500 ppm in 1970 from routine samplings of sludges at 57 treatment plants. The five sludges highest in zinc in Sweden ranged from 5,700 to 17,200 ppm zinc.11^ Blakeslee^3a reported zinc values for sludges from 58 municipal sewage treatment plants in Michigan. They ranged from 72 to 16,400 ppm, with 87 image: ------- a median value of 3,200 ppm zinc. Recently, Page1191a and Peterson et al. a also have summarized published data on the metal content of sludges. Depending upon the disposal or utilization of the sludge material, the presence of zinc in sewage sludge may or may not be a potential problem. Zinc contamination should cause no problems in well-designed landfill sites where there is no opportunity for leaching into surface waters or groundwater supplies. As mentioned, significant amounts of zinc may be released to the atmosphere when sludge is incinerated. Sludge which will be applied to agri- cultural or other lands that support plant growth may be the most dangerous problem. Indeed, zinc is such a common contaminant of sewage sludges that 283 Chumbley expressed the permissible levels of toxic metals in sewage used on agricultural land in terms of a zinc equivalent. Solid Wastes In addition to the effluents discharged to tailing ponds, zinc-bearing converter dust and retort waste are produced as solid wastes during smelting of zinc and lead ores. These wastes used to be dumped, but now the zinc is recovered.\"6 Converter dust is a mixture of zinc, lead, iron, and copper oxides. Leaching with a sulfuric acid solution removes the copper; addition of a bleaching powder precipitates the iron. The remaining zinc sulfate reverts to zinc through electrolysis. Retort residues, consisting of unconsumed coal, coke, and unreduced ore from incomplete distilla- tions, may contain 5-15% zinc. Because the composition varies so greatly, each residue must be separately analyzed to determine the best method of treatment. 88 image: ------- Many foundry and metallurgic operations produce wastes that can be treated to recover zinc. Skimmings from galvanizing operations may contain 20% metallic zinc and 35% zinc chloride; the zinc drosses that form at the bottom of galvanizing vats may yield intermediate grades of zinc; crude zinc oxide can be recovered from the leaching vats in which skimmings from galvanizing are treated. Zinc ashes and flue dust from foundries and smelters can be mixed with zinc ore and be distilled into slab zinc, or they can be used to make oxides and pigments; die-cast drosses and turnings may contain 40-70% recoverable zinc.^^ The reclaimed zinc products are used for galvanizing vat charges, producing rubber, making paint pigments and ceramic glazes, and for rolled zinc. Trace amounts of unrecoverable zinc will still remain in waste material even after reprocessing. This material frequently is deposited in municipal sewer systems and treated with the rest of the sewage. If the sludge from the sewage treatment is dried and incinerated, trace quantities of zinc may be released into the atmosphere. Zinc oxide is also a potential effluent from the incineration of vinyl products in which the zinc was used as a heat stabilizer. Data on the concentration of zinc emitted from one stack of a twin-stack municipal incinerator are set forth in Tables 4-16 and 4_17.1813 89 image: ------- TABLE 4-16 Metals Analysis of Samples Extracted from Various Points of One Stack of a Two-Stack Municipal Incinerator^ Cadmium Lead Metal Glass TOTAL 0.845 44 124.9 6,507 78.2 00 0 0 \u2014 401 0.02 0 0 408.8 ------- TABLE 4-17 Metals Emission Rate from One Stack of a Two-Stack Municipal Incinerator- Metal Mass Emission Rate, g/sec\u2014 Cadmium 0.017 Lead 0.683 Zinc ' 4.580 Copper 0.014 1813 Data from Yost et al.

Water is a popular coolant because it can also serve as a moderator to slow down neutrons. Although the water is purified before circulating through the reactor, small amounts of trace elements dissolved in the water are not removed. Also, corrosion products from reactor construction materials and feedwater systems are present. These impurities concentrate on the fuel cladding surfaces where they are bombarded by the intense neutron flux in the reactor and become radio- active. Zinc-65 is one of the radioactive contaminants formed in reactor coolant water in this way, particularly in those reactors in which admiralty brass is used in the feedwater system. Zinc from aluminum alloys also provides n the target material. The nuclear reactions involved are copper-63 ( EtfT)) zinc-65 and zinc-64 (n,^)^ zinc-65. The radioactive material is subsequently removed from the coolant water by ion exchange. Since it is generally classed as low-level, that is, it contains 10 uCi/ml or less of activity, \"^ this material may be contained for a brief period of time to allow shorter-lived radionuclides to decay; then it is discharged into a system that allows dilution of the remaining radioactivity. Discharge into rivers, lakes, and oceans provides ample dilution of the radioactive waste to below the maximum permissible limits. It is in this manner that waste containing zinc-65 is handled. +2 When it is discharged from a reactor, zinc-65 is a soluble cation, Zn If discharged into a river, it becomes associated with particulate matter in the water. Studies of the transport of zinc-65 by the Columbia River from Hanford reactors to the Pacific Ocean reveal that changes in physical form and concentration occurring in transit are caused primarily by adsorption on 92 image: ------- suspended sediments. Most of these suspended particles settle in the pro- 1977 tected and slack water regions of the river. Perkins et_ al., i7 sampling Hanford reactor effluent water from the Hanford reactors and river water at three downstream river locations, demonstrated an increased percentage of zinc-65 in particulate phase from 1.8% at the point of discharge to 14% at Pasco, Washington (56 km downstream) and 64% at Hood River, Oregon (336 km downstream), to 76% at Vancouver, the third point (448 km downstream). They also observed that total zinc-65 concentration at downstream locations de- creased, except during spring and early summer when flooding caused scouring of the river bed and resuspension of the deposited radioactivity. Annual samples of average metal concentrations from 1966 to 1970 taken at Richland, Washington and Bonneville Dam (48 and 384 km below the Hanford reactors, respectively) also showed that zinc-65 in the water decreased with distance because of settling (See Table 4-18). ^Oa Because all but one of the production reactors were closed during the time tests were conducted, the zinc concentration diminished from year to year. As river water mixes with ocean water, the amount of zinc-65 activity associated with particles decreases as salinity of the water increases (see / o *? Figure 4-6). This effect and the distribution of dissociated zinc in ocean water have been investigated by the Laboratory for the Study of Radioactive Contamination of the Sea at Fiascherino, Italy. The laboratory has reported that 10-20% of the naturally occurring zinc in sea water is in an ionic state, 30-50% is in particulate form, and 40-50% is in a complexed form. If the ionic form of zinc-65 (65Zn ) is added, its distribution among these forms is not equal. Exchange with the ionic and particulate forms is rapid, but even after 2 years, exchange is incomplete with the complexed forms; complexed zinc-65 is not in chemical equilibrium with and particulate zinc-65. 93 image: ------- 0) 4J \u00ab 1 so zinc-65 16 Salinity, 7. 24 o a 4 10 8 6 4 3 J 1 zinc-65 1 1 1 1 1 *\" \"Pafticulatc ~ \u2014'\u2014Soluble -X ' _ Is.

Jennings and Osterberg7^ reported in situ radioactivity measurements of estuarine sediments and overlying water; more zinc-65 activity was found in the sediments, and the highest radioactivity was observed in sedi- ments in protected areas of upstream portions of the estuary where fine-grained silts and clays would tend to settle from suspension. Gross570 and Osterberg,1181 comparing estuarine sediments with offshore sediments, found that radioactivity decreased rapidly with distance from the mouth of the river and the surface of the water. This distribution of zinc-65 was further evidenced by radioactivity levels in birds, fish, crustaceans, mollusks, algae, and plankton from along the Washington and Oregon coasts.1738 Concentrations were highest in samples at the mouth of the river, and they decreased very rapidly with distance from the river mouth, QQO as seen in Figure 4-7. Kujala analyzed 132 samples from 5 species of Pacific salmon and noted distinct differences in radioisotope concentration by species and area of capture. Chinook, chum, and pink salmon that spend most of their ocean life in the Bering Sea and the central north Pacific had zinc-65 activity less than 2.0 pCi/g, while Chinook and coho salmon that live within the Columbia River plume areas had levels as high as 49.2 pCi/g and 59.3 pCi/g, re- spectively. The highest level, 81.9 pCi/g, was found in Chinook salmon near Eureka, California, which has a nuclear power plant that disposes low-level wastes into the Pacific. Samples of sockeye salmon did not show any increase in zinc-65 activity close to the Columbia River; since these fish are thought to spend most of their ocean lie beyond the influence of the Columbia River, they would not be expected to be appreciably influenced by zinc-65 from the river. Radionuclides in the Columbia River water have been used as convenient tracers to study the dispersion of the river water itself in the Pacific Ocean. 95 image: ------- COOS BAY. ORE.

Reproduced from Watson et al. 1738. 96 image: ------- Since zinc-65 is taken up by most aquatic organisms and is usually the predominant Y-emitting radioelement found in biota samples, mapping the distribution of zinc-65 by analysis of samples of marine organisms has been particularly useful as an indication of the dispersion pattern of the river water. Such studies^92*1738 have shown that the dispersion follows two seasonal patterns: in summer, because of winds from the north, the flow is offshore toward the southwest as far as 320 km; and in winter, the flow is inshore, north of the river mouth along the coast of Washington, because of the southerly winds. Research on the distribution and levels of zinc-65 has been prompted by a concern for zinc-65 because it is radioactive, not because it is zinc. Although levels of zinc-65 discharged in effluent are below permissible levels, the potential exists that the radioactivity may be brought back to man in dangerously high levels if it becomes concentrated through food chains. Many studies have been undertaken to evaluate this possibility, including studies using controlled food chains,72 experiments with oysters raised in reactor effluent,^397 an image: ------- TABLE 4-19 Permissible Levels'2 for of Exposure _ Air, uCi/ml Water, yd/ml 4 Insoluble zinc-65 2 x 10~9 2 x 10~4 Atomic Energy Commission Standards.

The research on aspects of zinc in aquatic plants other than metabolism has been largely devoted to the fate of zinc-65 as a radioactive contaminant in water systems. Hence, much of the available literature deals with zinc-65 in aquatic plants. A requirement for zinc in the alga Stichococcus bacillaris was demonstrated 421 in 1926, and the metal is now considered to be required by all algae for normal growth and development. Besides the continuing research on metabolic functions and uptake of zinc-65, work is now being done on the ability of aquatic plants to concentrate zinc by several orders of magnitude from ambient waters. Interest has developed in using aquatic plants to remove zinc from contaminated waters as well as in the toxicity of zinc to the T695 plants. Vinogradov demonstrated that plants living in the ocean remove zinc from the water to produce zinc levels in the ocean which are more acceptable for the normal growth of other organisms. Zinc Uptake and Concentrations Uptake. There are two separate mechanisms of zinc uptake by aquatic plants. These are sorption processes (adsorption, absorption, and ion exchange) and metabolic assimilation. Both mechanisms may exist in the same organism, but the pathway utilized often is determined by metabolic requirements or environmental conditions. 99 image: ------- Evidence was provided that the uptake of zinc-65 in algae was 63 directly related to the rate of photosynthesis and metabolically controlled. The involvement of adsorption processes in zinc uptake by algae was confirmed when the green alga Golenkinia paricispina was used to show that zinc uptake involved ion exchange sites created by the photosynthetic removal of carbon 62 dioxide. Living and freshly killed algae were placed in the same concentration of zinc-65 and zinc uptake was determined by zinc accumulation in cells over time. Dead cells accumulated more zinc-65 than the living algae. These results were confirmed in studies of freshwater phytoplankton 345,346 and periphyton. Such results indicate that sorption mechanisms accumulate more zinc than is necessary for normal metabolic functions. 590 Gutknecht suggested that metabolic zinc uptake by algae may be a secondary process that occurs only after sorption has taken place. Much of 1452 the zinc sorption takes place in the cell walls of aquatic plants. The sorption processes are probably responsible for the large concentrations of zinc which are found in algae and other aquatic plants when compared to the zinc concentration of the ambient water. Uptake of zinc by aquatic plants is influenced by the structures in the plants. Algae are often covered by organic excretions that can function 146 as ion exchangers. Because of their suspended state, planktonic algae and free-floating vascular plants can take up zinc from the water but not from sediments. Benthie algae or rooted vascular hydrophytes which are submerged in water may take up zinc from either the sediments or the ambient water. Sediments are usually several orders of magnitude higher in zinc than the ambient water, but the relative importance of sediment and solution in supplying zinc to rooted aquatic plants is unknown. 100 image: ------- Concentration. The presence of zinc in aquatic plants has been established 123,646,1695 0 for some time. Some of the earliest analyses of aquatic plants OT Q which showed traces of zinc were conducted in 1919. It was variously demonstrated that the concentration of zinc in brown seaweed (Fucus vesi- _. t 123,196,591,1815 culosus) varies with the concentration in the seawater. 187,188 This observation was confirmed for another brown seaweed, Laminaria digitata. 275 Similar results had been obtained earlier. 187 Bryan, in studies with Laminaria digitata, found 2.2 mg zinc/1 of seawater and a growing tissue concentration of 5.4 mg zinc/g, resulting a concentration ratio f mg zinc/g tissue ]of zinc between plant and Vitag zinc/g ambient solution\"'' ^23 seawater to be 2,455. Earlier studies by Black and Mitchell produced lower concentration factors, listed in Table 5-1. In a review of mineral 1163 nutrition of algae, O'Kelley reported zinc-65 concentration factors in marine algae ranging up to 1,200. However, concentration ratios for 344a zinc-65 in Columbia River plankton were reported to range from 300-19,000. 649 Similar high concentration factors were reported for freshwater algae. In later research with brown seaweed, a tissue concentration factor of 146 3,240 for zinc was reported. Bowen cited ratios found by Russian workers who studied the uptake of zinc-65 by 32 species of algae, bryophytes, and vascular hydrophytes. The concentration factors usually ranged between 2,000-4,000 in tissue as compared to ambient water, where concentrations 259 were low. Chapman et al. found similar conditions determining zinc 149 concentration factors. Boyd found that certain aquatic plants concentrated zinc from the environment in early stages of growth, but uptake decreased as the growing season progressed. Boyd's work does not necessarily disagree 101 image: ------- TABLE 5-1 Concentration Factor, or Ratio of Zinc Content in Algae 6L> to Zinc Content in Seawater Species Concentration Factor mg zinc/g tissue Ardencaple Bay 1,000 1,400 1,100 600 400 600 1,000 900 from Black and Mitchell. 123 102 image: ------- with the research denoting a continued uptake throughout the growing season, because variations in uptake rate within a specific growing season were seldom determined. That aquatic plants can concentrate zinc from ambient water is well documented. The content and concentration factor for zinc in algae grown under 591 similar conditions was shown to be species-dependent by Gutknecht. How concentrations of zinc may vary by species is illustrated in Table 5-2. Much of the difference in zinc concentration factors by aquatic plants 146 is caused by differences in the ion exchange properties of their surfaces. One of the primary sites of zinc binding in aquatic plants is in the cell 1452 991 wall. In studies with Chlorella fusca, Matsku and Broda concluded that some zinc-65 taken up by the organism can be removed by exchange with unlabeled zinc, although another fraction is more tightly bound. Exchange- able zinc is probably in the free space, whereas the bound zinc is in the protoplast. There are probably marked differences in the metabolic assimilation of aquatic plants as well as in their ion exchange properties. Zinc concentrations assimilated by freshwater and marine organisms reported the - __ researchers in/ literature before 1964 have been summarized, and other/ have studied zinc concentration in aquatic plants and reported results similar to those f , , 105,512,908,1339,1815 of Matsku and Broda. The seasonal changes in zinc concentrations of aquatic plants must be considered when data are compared and interpreted. Table 5-3 contains data on zinc variations by season in several species of seaweed. Considerable variation in zinc content was evident in some species with different seasonal samplings, but other species contained relatively constant amounts of zinc through all seasons. Sampling techniques probably 103 image: ------- TABLE 5-2 Uptake and Concentration of Zinc-65' and 290 30 3,300 280 210 395 150 Total Zinc, Fresh Weight 23.80 0.96 124.00 image: ------- TABLE 5-3 Seasonal Variation in zinc/kg dry weight 40 103 79 99 no data 117 47 62 60 70 60 64 62 76 90 no data 116 63 105 59 92 a 123 D?ta from Black and Mitchell. 105 image: ------- account for some of the seasonal variability. However, data have been presented which confirm, a seasonal fluctuation in zinc content of Fucua 196 859a veslculosua. Knauer and Martin found that the seasonal variations of zinc in both water and phytoplankton in Monterey Bay, California, were related to the upswelling of the ocean and possibily to the availability of zinc from organic matter on the ocean floor. Other biologic, chemical, and environmental factors that can Influence the seasonal variation of zinc in aquatic plants are growth rate, supply of other nutrients, and temperature. Zinc toxicoses in aquatic plants are distinct possibilities in areas where vine-contaminated surface waters exist. Complete destruction of aquatic plant communities because of zinc toxicosis in areas associated 110 with mining or processing of ore was reported by Besch and Roberts-Pichette in their study on the effects of zinc mining pollution in the Miramlchi River system of northern New Brunswick, Canada. 527,1769 A laboratory bioassay approach was developed to determine critical levels of zinc that would be potentially toxic to many aquatic plants. The sampling, analysis and correlation studies that have been completed show promise, but variables such as pH, light, temperature, and the presence of other species can influence the reliability of 384 a critical metal level. Dietz conducted bloassays on mosses to assess the trend of water pollution by metals and found that the mosses were considerably enriched by zinc because the water had been contaminated by it. The amount of enrichment also was dependent upon plant species 527 and specific plant selectivity. Gerloff used plant analysis to 106 image: ------- evaluate nutrient supplies and growth-limiting nutrients for the aquatic weeds Elodea occidentalia and Ceratophvllum dejmuraum in lakes and streams. The critical concentration of zinc was 8 ppm in the second 2.5-cm segment of main branches and laterals of Elodea occidentalis. 1540 Sprague used a bioassay that established a critical level of 0.75 mg zinc/1 of ambient water as a value which caused lethal effects in aquatic plants. The 0.75 mg zinc/1 value applied only when zinc was in an ionic form; the presence of nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) also reduced the toxiclty of the zinc to the plants. Therefore, the form in which zinc exists in solution is an Important factor in evaluating potential zinc toxicity to plants. 1615 Tlerney did not find a clear relationship between concentration of zinc in Elodea anadensls and Ceratophyllum demursum and the zinc content of the ambient waters, and he observed that more detailed field and laboratory studies were needed to identify the specific factors which control availability, uptake, and accumulation of zinc by aquatic plants. Factors Affecting Zinc Uptake and Accumulation Temperature. Variations in temperature significantly influence the metabolic 366 rate of aquatic organisms. Organisms which obtain zinc through food conuumption were shown to increase their zlnc-65 accumulation as their rate 338,637,1332 of food consumption increased at elevated temperatures. Similar Increases In zinc uptake by aquatic plants can be expected as rates of metabolism increase with increasing temperature of ambient water. 107 image: ------- 590,592 pH. Zinc uptake and accumulation by algae is dependent upon pH. Gutknecht found accumulation of zinc-65 by Ulva lactuca to be twice as high at pH 8 as at pH 7 and three times as high at pH 9 as at pH 8. These data and later research, in which zinc uptake was found to follow the Freundlich adsorption equation, demonstrated that pH-dependent adsorption exchange 591 183 was an important mechanism of zinc uptake by aquatic plants. Brungs observed that the solubility of zinc-65 decreased with increasing pH in freshwaters. These observations were confirmed by the calculation of solubility products, but the precipitation of zinc would be low enough to provide adequate zinc for aquatic plant growth and development at near neutral pH values. Ambient concentration of zinc. Accumulation of zinc in aquatic plants 123,187, was found to be directly related to the amount in the ambient water. 188 196 591 1815 The log of the zinc concentration in Chlorella cells was discovered to be proportional to the log of the zinc concentration in the 860 medium over a hundredfold range in concentration of zinc. Halving the ambient concentration of zinc-65 available to Chlorella resulted in a 50% 345 decrease in uptake rate and total amount accumulated. Previously 62 592 Bachmann and Gutknecht had reported similar results with certain other algae species, and similar relationships have been demonstrated for 392 mercury in vascular aquatic plants. Competing.-ion. The presence of other cations in waters containing zinc have been shown to reduce the amount of zinc taken up by aquatic plants. 108 image: ------- 62 Bachmann found that zinc-65 uptake In the green algae, Golenkinia, was reduced when concentrations of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium 345 were increased. Gushing and Rose reported that zinc-65 uptake by periphyton was reduced 50% when the amount of magnesium in solution was doubled. Also, doubling the stable zinc concentration decreased the zinc-65 uptake by 25% (probably caused by isotopic dilution). The competition between zinc-65 and other cations for available binding sites on the plants is responsible 345 for such occurrences. Light. If minimum requirements for photosynthesis are met, increased light 590,592 intensity will cause little increase in zinc uptake or accumulation. Functions of Zinc 1296 Zinc functions primarily in plants as a metalloenzyme. Several zinc-requiring dehydrogenases, proteinases, and peptidases have been identified 1295 in various organisms, including aquatic plants. Price reported that several dehydrogenases were sensitive to zinc deficiency in Eugjlena gracilis. Therefore, the metabolism of aquatic plants can be influenced markedly by changes in the availability of zinc. Data indicate that zinc deficiency rapidly reduces the amount of RNA as well as the ribosome contents of ly be as a 1289,1296 1296 cells. Another function for zinc in plant metabolism may be as a stabilizer of the cytoplasmic ribosomes of Euglena gracilis. It also has been suggested that zinc aids in auxin B production, but a definite connection between zinc and indolacetate has not been 1296 determined. For additional information on the metabolic role of zinc in connection with metalloenzyme activity, see Chapter 9. 109 image: ------- TERRESTRIAL PLANTS* Reports of the use of zinc as a nutrient in plant fertilizer 790 157 appeared in the literature as early as 1912, and Brechley described zinc deficiency in higher plants in 1914. That zinc was essential to 1523 plant life was established by Sommer and Lipman when they reported that zinc was required for three plant species. Zinc was discovered to be necessary for trees when zinc deficiency was identified on fruit trees 255 in California, and when pecan rosette (a malformation of the new leaves 14 of growing tips) in the South was found to be caused by zinc deficiency. Knowledge of the nature of zinc made the identification of many nutritional problems in higher plants possible. Zinc deficiency is now the most 938 common micronutrient deficiency in the United States. Using zinc fertilizer to improve crop growth also is well established. Although it is possible for zinc toxicity to be a problem to plants, zinc deficiency in plants is far more likely than toxicosis. Crops that are sensitive to zinc deficiency are citrus and deciduous tree fruits, pecans, pine (in Australia), grapes, kidney beans, hops.soybeans, corn, lima beans, flax, castor beans, and onions. Cotton, potatoes, tomatoes, alfalfa, clovers, sorghum, sudan grass, and sugar beets are mildly sensitive to zinc deficiency, and peas.small grains, peppermint, asparagus, mustard and other crucifers, forage grasses, safflower, and carrots are not 1686 sensitive to it. *The research discussed in this section appeared in the literature before April 1975. 110 image: ------- Availability of Zinc in Soils Climatic and soil conditions responsible for zinc deficiency in crops 956 in the United States were reviewed in detail by Lucas and Khezefc. Zinc 1387 deficiency in European countries was reviewed earlier. Some important factors associated with or contributing to zinc availability in soils are 938 956 summarized below. Further details may be found in two reviews. * Soil low in zinc reserves. Quartz is low in zinc, so sandy soils often 938 contain only 10-30 ppm total zinc. A similar observation has been reported for peat and muck soils, where zinc in the plant root is separated from the mineral reserves below the organic surface layer. Under acid conditions, zinc may be rapidly leached from the soil where rainfall is 956 great. High soil pH. Most disorders in plants caused by zinc deficiency occur in calcareous soils with a pH of 7.4 or higher, because the solubility of zinc decreases as soil pH increases. The total zinc content of calcareous soils is often equal to or higher than that of noncalcareous soils. In addition to precipitation at high soil pH values, adsorption of zinc by carbonates may contribute to low availability of zinc to plants on certain calcareous 939,956 soils. Limited root zones. Zinc deficiencies are frequently found in soils with restricted root zones. They may be caused by hardpans, high water tables, or other factors. Equipment passage may compact soil and cause zinc defi- 956 ciency in certain agricultural soils. The root development of rice 111 image: ------- grown on flooded and nonf looded soils in Alabama determined the amount of 535 zinc available to plants. Microbial fixation and low soil organic matter. Zinc deficiency in beans and corn on calcareous soils is often observed on old corral sites and barnyards and has been attributed to the rapid growth of microorganisms 956 that may tie up available zinc. Zinc deficiency in corn is sometimes more severe when it has been planted after a crop of sugar beets than when 938 planted in soil used for corn or many other crops. DeRemer and 378 Smith observed that plowing down sugar beet tops reduced available zinc to the succeeding bean crop. Therefore, organic matter or soil microorganisms help determine the zinc fixation by soils. Zinc deficiencies are often reported in areas where surface soil containing organic matter 572 938 has been removed. Lindsay concluded that deficiencies increased because the exposed subsoil was lower in organic matter and higher in pH and carbonate than the surface soil. Indeed, a close correlation 487, between soil organic matter and extractable zinc has been well documented. More observations of zinc deficiencies were reported in Michigan 956 where the surface soil was disturbed and the subsoil exposed. Soil temperature and moisture. Cool, wet spring weather often aggravates 956 or induces zinc deficiency in field crops. Limited plant root growth, which brings about a limited root feeding zone and reduced microbial activity so that zinc is not released from organic matter during the cool, 1719 damp weather, may cause such deficiencies. Wallace, et al. have found 112 image: ------- 86 that zinc uptake increases with temperature. Bauer and Lindsay concluded that decreased solubility of zinc in the soil,rather than a biologic effect^ was the primary reason for more pronounced zinc deficiencies in cool weather. 523 Additional research supported those results. Soil moisture and aeration 432 influence zinc availability through indirect soil reactions and root metabolism. High phosphate levels in soil. A phosphorus-induced zinc deficiency has . 131,435,523,977,1121,1384,1465,1686 A ,. , been widely reported. Application of phosphate fertilizer and high phosphorus levels in soils have been linked to zinc deficiency problems for many years. ' Since zinc extractable from soil is not decreased by the addition of phosphorus to soils, the formation of insoluble zinc phosphate compounds in soils 939,1168 is probably not the cause of a phosphorus-induced zinc deficiency. The deficiency may result from the formation of an iron phosphate at the root surface that excludes zinc uptake where soil zinc levels already . 432 are low. Influences of nitrogen in soil. The acidifying influences of nitrogen fertilizers \u2014 which make zinc solubility greater and possibly increase the cation exchange capacity of roots when the nitrogen supply increases \u2014 132,396,939,1687 have been cited as causes of enlarged zinc uptake in plants. Movement of Zinc to Plant Roots Zinc is believed to move through the soil to plant roots by mass 938 flow (convection) and diffusion. Mass flow is the movement of nutrients 113 image: ------- along with the soil solution, whereas diffusion is the movement of nutrients 1775 through the soil solution because of a concentration gradient. (Olsen 1169 and Kemper provide a detailed review on movement of nutrients to plant 73,74,238,290,371,425,426,434 roots.) Various workers have shown that diffusion gradients are formed between the soil solution and plant roots and that most zinc movement to plant roots is by diffusion. Warncke and 1733- Barber have explained how the rate of zinc diffusion in soil is controlled. 1735 Soil moisture, bulk density, and zinc adsorption are all important 1776 in determining final zinc diffusion rates. Wilkinson et al. have reported that tripling the transpiration rate in wheat seedlings did not yield an increased uptake of zinc, and concluded that zinc movement to plant roots was independent of mass flow and dependent upon diffusion. 607 These results were confirmed for several species. The movement of zinc to plant roots is dependent upon soil solution concentration and the 938 ability of soil to replenish zinc removed from solution. Lindsay and 941 Norvell reported that increasing soil pH decreased solubility of zinc 939 in soils, and Lindsay stated that the diminished zinc concentration and subsequent reduced concentration gradient would reduce zinc availability 1028 and uptake by plants. Melton et al. have confirmed the influence of soil pH on zinc diffusion and found a limited influence of phosphorus on zinc diffusion. The effects of chelates upon zinc solubility and availability to _ . J 170,174,175,212,372,425,426,574,712,938, plants have been well documented. 941 1149 1717 ' ' Chelating agents increase the solubility of zinc in soils 938 and increase the movement of zinc to plant roots by both mass flow and diffusion. 114 image: ------- The ability of the plant root to compete with the chelating agent for the zinc will determine if the actual amount of zinc uptake by plants will be increased or decreased from chelation. Adding chelating agents to soils will usually increase zinc availability to plants because the solubility is increased; but the addition of a chelating agent to nutrient solutions 938 may reduce the uptake of zinc that is already in solution. Zinc Uptake, Translocation, and Concentration by Plants 938 1078 Uptake. Zinc absorption by plants has been reviewed, ' and factors influencing plant absorption of zinc have been identified. ' Ranges of zinc uptake from 2-4,000 ng/day on a fresh weight basis 239,1428 695 have been reported. Hewitt reported optimal levels of zinc for plants growing in nutrient solution to range from 0.3-3.0 yM, Carroll 238 and Loneragan observed that a variety of plants grew well at 0.01 yM with maximum growth at 0.25 uM zinc. Zinc absorption by sugar cane 147 has been investigated with similar findings. Considerable uncertainty still exists about the roles of active 938,1078 and passive mechanisms in zinc uptake by plants. Conclusions of workers who failed to separate passive exchange absorption from active 166,441,1078,1317, cellular accumulation are the source of much conflict. ' For example, some researchers of zinc translocation found that xylem exudates from tomatoes and soybeans contained higher concentrations 27,1617 of zinc than did the nutrient solution in which the plants were grown. Such results suggest an active accumulation component in the plant if it is assumed that the zinc in the xylem exudate is present in a form similar 115 image: ------- to that in the external nutrient solution. Most of the evidence based on study of metabolic inhibitors points toward an active accumulation component 536 crucial to zinc uptake. Translocation. Zinc is translocated from the roots to the tops of plants through the xylem, and a limited amount of zinc is retranslocated 938,1617,1618,1721 from the leaves through the phloem. (For a review of 1618 the translocation in plants, see Tiffin. ) It is intermediately mobile 938 within plants compared with other micronutrients. Zinc is localized in 238 plant roots when zinc supply is normal, but it moves from roots to plant 984,1340 tops when in limited supply. Also, some plants increase the efficiency of the zinc they have stored by redistributing it from seeds 200,938,1088,1618 to leaves and from older to newer plant tissue. 1168 Olsen reviewed the interactions of zinc and other elements in plants. Generally, zinc and phosphorus interactions reduce the uptake 111,113,169,827,1084,1502,1559,1604 and translocation of zinc by plants. Also, a high level of available nitrogen often causes increased zinc deficiency. Much of this deficiency was attributed to increased formation of zinc-protein complexes in plant roots that inhibited normal transloca- 1168 tion to plant tops. Excess copper or iron in a plant also will bring about intensified zinc deficiency. The influence of zinc in suppressing copper uptake and translocation by plants usually is greater than the 263 suppressive effect of excessive copper upon zinc translocation. 786 Iron levels were reported to be high in zinc-deficient sweet corn. The application of phosphorus decreased zinc concentrations in plants and 116 image: ------- 26 plants low in zinc were high, in iron. Ambler and Brown have observed that lowering zinc concentration in solution has increased the translocation of iron and phosphorus into bean leaves. Because the iron and phosphorus consistently increased in bean plants, the phosphorus evidently did not 1737 inhibit iron translocation. Similar findings have been reported for corn, and decreasing the amount of zinc applied increased the phosphorus uptake nearly sevenfold in leaf tissue, but only threefold in stems and roots. Zinc uptake and translocation in tomato, soybean and squash plants 960 were increased when the salt concentration of the growth medium was increased. Hence, there may not be an antagonistic relationship between soluble salts and zinc in nutrient culture. Nor has additional research on iron, man- 452 ganese, and zinc interactions (using isotopic techniques) been conclusive. Macronutrient cations, as well as copper and hydrogen, suppressed zinc uptake and translocation by wheat seedlings, but iron and manganese had no 9fi1 9fi9 effect on zinc uptake. ' Therefore, the evidence for zinc interactions with various elements is not solid and varies according to plant species and other minerals present. For example, Brown e al. reviewed the differential susceptibility of various plant genotypes to zinc deficiency. A study of zinc in temperate crops and pasture grasses revealed that species differ in their ability 540 to take up and utilize zinc. Similar findings have been reported for navy beans,431'803'1258'1317 cats,209 rice,534 soybeans,1716 sugar cane,128 and wheat.1 A definite genetic basis for zinc uptake, distribution, 603,984 and utilization by corn plants was confirmed by others. 117 image: ------- 1417 800 Concentration. Sauchelli and Jones summarized ranges of zinc concentration in plants. When zinc drops to levels below 20 ppm dry weight in leaves, deficiencies may occur. The normal concentration range is 25-150 ppm. Zinc and toxicoses often occur when levels exceed 400 ppm. Zinc concentration ranges for several specific plant species have been 85,258,540 reported. The concentration of zinc in plant tissue usually is greatest in young plants; it decreases because of dilution and redistribu- 550,799,1088,1341 _ tion as the tissues grow and mature. Crops were 1689 classified into three groups by Viets et al. according to their zinc concentration. Table 5-4 sets forth the variety of zinc concentrations possible which do not produce visible symptoms of deficiency or toxicosis. Zinc Disorders in Plants Deficiency. Zinc deficiency symptoms have been described in detail for 1417 1612 several plants, and zinc deficiency and its control have been reviewed. Because zinc is intermediate in mobility within the plant, a variety of symptoms, including chlorosis, stunting, and necrotic tissue may indicate zinc deficiency. In corn and sorghum plants, chlorotic streaks appear in older leaves. The older leaves of navy beans and soybeans turn yellow, and the entire plant becomes stunted and fails to produce a normal crop when the deficiency is severe. In citrus, peach, pecan, and tung frees, irregular chlorosis and bronzing occurs and the new growth becomes stunted. Severe deficiency may kill the leaves and twigs and the growing tip may be deformed, exhibiting a symptom known as \"resetting.\" 118 image: ------- TABLE 5-4 Zinc Content of Crop Plants^ Crop Plant Zinc, ppm Deficient Low Normal High Toxic Corn leaves, vegetative stage Soybean leaves, vegetative stage Wheat, barley oats, vegetative stage (7.5-30 cm) Cotton, vegetative stage Tobacco, vegetative stage Sugar beets, vegetative stage Potatoes Alfalfa tops Grass, vegetative Totatoes (leaves) Citrus (leaves) Florida Tung (leaves) Apples (leaves) Peaches (leaves) Pears (leaves) Grapes (petioles) 200 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 aDerived from Sauchelli14^ and Bishop and MacEachern.^O 119 image: ------- Symptoms of zinc metabolic disorders also are expressed cytologically and morphologically. There are more free amino nitrogen and amides in 1267 zinc-deficient plants than in healthy ones. Inorganic phosphate also is higher in the region outside the stele and in the phloem of 1321 deficient stem tissue. In many plant species, zinc deficiency is 258 shown by interveinal chlorosis because the chlorophyll 1453 1464 formation has been disrupted. According to Seatz\"3nd Jurinak, the palisade cells of leaves are larger and transversely divided, rather than columnar; reduction in number of chloroplasts; the absence of starch grains; the presence of oil droplets in the chloroplasts and the presence of calcium oxalate crystals and accumulation of phenolic materials in the leaves. are morphologic changesvthat plants undergo when deficient ia ziae, Diagnosis and correction of deficiency. Plant and soil analyses can be useful tools in diagnosing zinc deficiency in many plants. A current review which includes soil testing and plant analysis techniques for zinc 1724 has been edited by Walsh and Beaton. Zinc deficiency usually is suspected if plant tissue concentrations are below 20 ppm zinc, but the critical level varies with species, stage of growth, and plant part 1026 sampled. Levels of zinc in solutions obtained from soil extractions with acids or chelating agents have been correlated with the occurrence of zinc deficiency. Usually, about 50 ml of solution is used to extract zinc from 10 g of soil. Use of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid has been accepted for several years, but solutions containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) have also been used. Critical zinc levels in the extracting solution that have been related to zinc deficiency in plants 21,1724 631 range from 0.5-2 ppm zinc. Hag and Miller have compared four 120 image: ------- zinc extractants on 65 soils and found EDTA and DTPA extractions to be 445 most useful in predicting zinc deficiency. But Evans et al. found few differences in correlations between zinc uptake and soil zinc extracted with several extractants. The reliability of soil tests to predict zinc availability in soils is dependent upon many soil and plant factors and no single extractant works best in all situations.1623 Table 5-5 summarizes recommendations of zinc fertilizer applications on specific crops by state. With most plants, zinc deficiency can be overcome by soi,l or foliar 927,955 application of zinc salts. Zinc sulfate or finely powdered zinc oxide are the inorganic zinc salts usually applied. However, Wallace 1718 and Romney have used zinc sulfate, alnc NTA and zinc EDTA with great success; seven different zinc sources were evaluated extensively and found to be effective during the first few months after application. However, the zinc apparently reverts to forms of equal availability after 1-3 yr. Banding the zinc fertilizer 2.5 cm to the side of and 5.0 cm below the seed 801,802 provides the most efficient use per pound of zinc by responsive crops, and banded and broadcast applications of zinc to soils for crop response have 963,1693 been successfully used. Zinc has been applied to corn seed at 980 planting time without injury, and the plants have responded to the zinc fertilizer, but many crops may suffer from salt toxicosis during germination. Applying zinc in the form of synthetic chelates increased 128,1693 zinc efficiency from two*to fivefold compared to zinc sulfate. But.certain zinc chelates are relatively soluble and can be leached out 892 of the plant root zone when the soil is excessively moist. Most crops use less than one kilogram of zinc per hectare of soil per year. 121 image: ------- TABLE 5-5 Recommendations for Applying Zinc Fertilizer State Alabama California Colorado^ Florida Georgia Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maryland Michigan by_ Crops pecan corn all tree crops and field crops corn tree crops vegetable and field crops ornamentals pecans peaches corn corn corn, soybeans corn, sorghum corn citrus, pecans, tung corn beans State0 Recommendations for Zinc 1.8 - 2.25 kg ZnS04/tree/yr .11.25 kg ZnS04/ha tree: 1.02 - 2.96 kg ZnS04/100 liter water field: 11.25 - 22.5 kg ZnS04/ha 5.63 - 11.25 kg ZnS04/ha 360 g ZnS04, plus 120 g lime/100 liter water 90 - 225 g ZnO every 4-5 yr 90 - 270 g ZnO every 4-5 yr 0 . 9 kg ZnS04/cm trunk diameter 0.9 - 1.35 kg ZnS04/tree 11.25 - 22.5 kg ZnS04/ha 0.9 kg ZnS04/ha applied as plow down 11.25 - 22.5 kg ZnS04/ha 11.25 - 16.88 kg ZnS04/ha 4.5 kg ZnS04 in row 360 g ZnS04, plus 120 g lime/100 liter water 11.25 kg ZnSO,/ha 2.25 - 4.5 kg ZnSO./ha 122 image: ------- TABLE 5-5 (Continued) North Dakota* Oklahoma* Oregon* South Carolina Tennessee Texas Utah2* Crops corn pecans, tung, corn cherries, apples castor beans, corn, fruit, sugar beets, soybeans peaches corn, potatoes pecans corn, lima beans all tree fruit cherries pear barley corn pecans vegetables corn pecans fruit Recommendations for Zinc 11.25 kg ZnS04/ha 2.25 - 4.5 kg ZnS04/tree 11.25 kg ZnS04/ha 16.88 kg ZnS04/ha 5.63 -22.50 kg 44.2 liter water 3 16.88 ZnS04/ha ZnS04/ha 5.86 - 12.38 kg ZnS04/ha 204 g/100 liter water 1.42 - 1.77 kg ZnS04/liter water 590 g ZnS04/ioo liter water 16.88 kg ZnS04/ha 11.25 kg ZnS04/ha 4.5 - 5.4 kg ZnS04/mature tree 5.63 kg ZnS04/ha 11.25 - 22.5 ZnS04/ha foliar: 360 g ZnS04/100 liter water 11.25 kg ZnS04/ha 1417 ?Derived from Sauchelli.

Similar residual effects of zinc 129 6*52 9^8 fertilizer have been reported. * ' ' Foliar application of zinc to plants, often used to provide supplemental zinc, is usually imposed 927,1062 90 at rates of 1.13 kg zinc/ha/application. It also has been reported that certain surfactants enhance foliar absorption of zinc. Once absorbed, 233 1795 zinc is not easily leached from vegetative parts of plant tissues . 130 Toxicosis. It is well established that excess zinc can be toxic to plants. 133,256,258,519,913,1095,1320,1546 Staker and Cummins1546 found zinc toxicosis in onions, spinach and potatoes in some peat soils in New York. The soils had accumulated several thousand ppm zinc (normal soils contain 97 10-300 ppm). However, few areas of natural zinc toxicity exist. Toxic amounts of zinc /usually occur in acid soils or in contaminated areas such as mine spoil banks, industrial areas, waste disposal sites, or areas of mine seepage. Zinc was toxic to corn and cowpeas when added to soil at rates 519 of 560-1,120 kg zinc/ha. A concentration of 50 ppm zinc in Sanilac field beans can be poisonous; toxicosis at this concentration was produced 1027 mainly with acid soils. Zinc toxicosis has been reported in several 256 plants in greenhouse studies when excessive levels of zinc were added. 130 133 Boawn and Boawn and Rasmussen have investigated potential zinc toxicosis in many plants, and their results are provided in Tables 5-6 124 image: ------- TABLE 5-6 Zinc Concentration in Leafy Vegetables Grown at Normal and Excessive Rates Zinc Fertilization a Crop Head Lettuce (Lactuca sativa, var. capitata) oleracea) 847 Grand Rapids Parr is Island Parris Island Green Curled Extra Curled Dwarf Lucullus Improved Thick Leaf Chihli Chihli Florida Broad- leaf Vates Ear liana Long Island Imperial Sample Description Market size Market size Whole plant heading Market size Market size Market size Market size Market size Whole plant heading Market size Market size heads plants before heads plants plants plants plants before heads plants Rosette of young leaves Market size Market size heads heads of Zinc Treatment, kg/ha 0 38 38 32 48 32 58 80 139 54 46 32 33 22 50 11 45 46 40 . 50 38 50 72 119 48 42 32 34 20 47 55 64 64 56 62 73 86 153 148 68 60 36 38 23 56 112 ppm 94 125 78 76 142 107 325 175 84 71 43 42 28 50 224 144 157 108 100 247 188 615 240 89 112 58 63 34 62 448 165 239 146 117 308 296 704 344 112 248 131 104 54 73 896 248 269 179 122 343 438 862\" 340-' 114 389 364 366 73 79 aData from Boawn.13\u00b0 the indicated rate of zinc fertilization, plants showed normal color but were stunted. image: ------- 842 and 5.7. King and Morris reported zinc toxicosis in rye at soil applica- tions of 600 kg zinc/ha in sewage sludge on sandy loam soil, but no toxicosis 841 was observed in Bermuda grass at the same zinc levels. Zinc levels in the plants were in excess of 300 ppm at the highest rate of zinc application. Zinc toxicosis was induced in pine trees on three coastal plain soils of 1673 Florida when 200-300 ppm zinc was added to the soil. Tissue concentra- tions reached 300 ppm zinc at the highest application rates. 267 Conversely, Chesnin observed that field experiments in Nebraska involving zinc applications up to 700 ppm zinc for corn on acid and alkaline soils did not bring about toxicosis. However, corn is thought to be moderately tolerant to excessive zinc levels in soil. In Michigan, a single application of 140 kg zinc/ha did not induce zinc toxicosis to navy 1693 beans on a calcareous soil. Nor did additions of 387 kg zinc/ha result in toxicosis in corn, cucumbers, or snap beans grown on a sandy soil in 1725 Wisconsin. Six annual additions of 11.1 kg zinc/ha on a sandy soil 979 in Virginia did not cause toxicosis in soybeans. Tolerance. Certainly many plant and soil factors influence the susceptibility of various species to zinc toxicosis. However, certain species have a relatively high tolerance to zinc in soils.

Although many plants are sensitive to high soil zinc levels, certain plants can provide vegetative cover on zinc-contaminated soils because of their tolerance for high zinc levels in soils. In Europe, Minuartia verna. var. gracilis, and Gomphrena canescens are such reliable markers that they are used as such in prospecting for heavy metals. Philadelphus sp. is a similar 43 signal in the state of Washington. The mechanisms of zinc tolerance in colonial bent grass (which is readily tolerant to zinc) and creeping bent grass (which is not) have been well examined.1237'1633'1634 Similar amounts of zinc entered the tolerant and intolerant plants and similar amounts reached the tops, but the tolerant plants appeared to deactivate zinc. Most of the cytoplasmic zinc in the 1237 tops of colonial bent grass existed as a stable anionic complex. Considerable differences were noted among the physiologic responses of the bent grass species. ' The binding of zinc in the cell wall fraction was suggested as the mechanism of zinc tolerance in the colonial bent grass. Species other than bent grass have developed zinc-tolerant 563 ecotypes, but they have not yet been studied in detail. The relationships between cadmium and zinc in grasses are quite 744 important to human and animal nutrition. Huffman and Hodgson determined the zinc:cadmium ratios in wheat and perennial grass samples from 19 states 128 image: ------- east of the Rocky Mountains. No zinc: cadmium ratios appeared to be determined by regions of the country in which the plants grew. These data are summarized in Table 5-8. High levels of zinc may suppress cadmium uptake by plants, but at levels of zinc normally found in soils, suppression does not seem to 256,598,1632 occur. There is evidence that each element may enhance the uptake of the other even when relatively low levels of cadmium and zinc are present in 256 the soil. Zinc in Plant Metabolism The specific functions of zinc in plant metabolism are not completely defined, but much progress has been made in the last 30 years. Established 1296 functions of zinc in plant metabolism have been reviewed. The best defined and most important role of zinc in plants is as * an enzyme cof actor. Carbonic anhydrase was the first zinc metalloenzyme to be identified in plants and considerable research has been and is still 55,56,371,415,450,554a,1130, conducted on zinc and carbonic anhydrase activity. 1312,14 8,1624,1803 ^^ metalloenzymes that been described . Zinc binds pyridine nucleotides to the protein portion of enzymes and zinc atoms stabilize the structure of yeast alcohol 59 8a dehydrogenase . It has been recognized as an essential component of a variety of dehydr ogenases , proteinases, and peptidases, as well as the more information on zinc and enzymatic activity, see Chapter 9. 129 image: ------- TABLE 5-8 Average Cadmium Concentrations and.

Zinc supplied to a deficient citrus plant increased RNA and protein synthesis but 838 1764 decreased ribonuclease activity in the leaves. Subsequently, White et al. reported that RNA synthesis was a prerequisite for protein synthesis. Zinc supplied to deficient Neurospora increased the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase only in the presence of a nitrogen source; apparently protein synthesis must occur to affect enzyme activity. The presence of a nitrogen source appears 1294 to be a general requirement for the recovery of zinc-sensitive functions. When zinc is insufficient in growing organisms, metabolic lesion occurs. 1433,1710 First, RNA falls to form, followed by protein, total nitrogen and DNA lesions./ 1294 In Euglena severely deficient in zinc, the absolute amount of RNA decreases. 837,838 RNA hydrolysis has been found to increase in citrus leaves lacking zinc. Zinc in plants is known to be closely associated with proteins, ' 798 1488 and it is bound to some enzymes. Sibly and Wood found that zinc was not removed by dialysis against water from plant carbonic anhydrase. Zinc is more concentrated in the protein fraction of the Russett Burbank potato tuber rather than in the tuber as a whole, indicating an association 926 between zinc and protein. Chelating agents remove or combine with zinc cofactors in enzymes, so that enzymatic activity is lost. In yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, 1, 10-phenanthroline does not remove zinc from the enzyme but forms a dissociable zinc-protein-chelate complex that inhibits enzyme activity. This reaction is common to many other zinc metalloenzymes 1653,1658 dependent upon pyridine. 131 image: ------- Zinc is so firmly bound in carboxypeptidase that it is not removed by prolonged dialysis against water; however, 1,10-phenanthroline will remove the zinc. Carbonic anhydrase also binds zinc so firmly that its 712 zinc will not exchange with zinc-65 for over 32 days. 928 There are two types of interaction between zinc and proteins. Zinc metalloenzymes are enzymes in which zinc atoms are specifically and firmly incorporated into the protein, so that they can be considered as a single physical entity in their native state, and homogeneous metalloenzymes can be isolated and identified. In contrast, zinc metal-protein complexes are formed with enzymes which may require zinc as one of several units for activity. The enzymes are more weakly bonded with zinc and cannot be 928 isolated. Less zinc is bound by enzymes or whole plant extracts as the 798 pH of the medium decreases. 1296 Price et al. stated that if zinc were essential to cytoplasmic ribosome stability, then it would be necessary to provide another function of zinc in plant growth and development. Such a function was proposed when it was found that cytoplasmic ribosomes of Euglena gracilis contained large amounts of 1289 zinc and that the ribosomes became unstable when the Euglena lacked zinc. Early research showed that zinc and auxin contents are linked in 1491 1630 higher plants and Tsui concluded that zinc was essential for the synthesis of tryptophan in tomato and indirectly for its auxin synthesis. Later, Nason found that zinc was needed to form tryptophan from indole and serine. 132 image: ------- Because zinc is primarily an enzyme cofactor, it is likely that zinc aids 1 / C O auxin synthesis by activating enzymes. For example, growth was stimulated 1394 in zinc-deficient corn seedlings by adding tryptophan. Therefore, zinc may be needed to synthesize tryptophan rather than in the direct formation of auxins. The role of zinc in auxin formation is certainly not clear at present. Research also has been reported which postulates that zinc may 804,805 be involved with starch metabolism in bean plants. Again, the research is not yet sufficiently advanced to evaluate this newly proposed function for zinc. 133 image: ------- CHAPTER 6 ZINC IN AQUATIC ANIMALS Zinc is distributed throughout freshwater and marine aquatic environ- ments and occurs in all organisms analyzed. Interest in the accumulation and distribution of zinc in aquatic organisms has arisen from a concern about heavy metals or radioisotopes in human food products of marine or freshwater origin. However, in terrestrial organisms, interest always has been sparked by the need to know nutritional requirements for domestic stock and fowl as well as humans. Therefore, much of the information on zinc in aquatic environments is found in the literature on radioecology and pollution rather than in biochemistry and nutrition reviews. Literature about the eco- logic cycling of zinc in aquatic environments and distribution of zinc in 62 1339 1695 aquatic organisms has been written by Bachman, Rice, Vinogradov, 105 1223 1797,1800 Bernhard and Zattera, Pentreath, and Wolfe. CONCENTRATIONS OF ZINC IN AQUATIC ANIMALS Marine Animals Zinc is present in significant concentrations in all marine animals. The range of concentration among species is relatively narrow, except for .oysters, in which very high amounts may occur. Whereas the zina content of most seafoods ranges from 3-30 ppm, oysters contain tOOfc2,QOO ppm. The National Marine Fisheries Service has conducted extensive investiga- tions into the content of zinc in numerous species of marine fish, mollusks and crustaceans. These results are summarized in Table 6-1. The average zinc content of all finfish was about 6.5 ppm, and means for individual 134 image: ------- TABLE 6-1 Zinc Content of Fish and Shellfish from Coastal Waters of North America^ Species macrocephalus) Area6 C w C s C A S C W C A S G G W Samples analyzed0 8 10 30 24 17 19 21 21 21 26 29 10 19 30 37 135 Mean 4.05 6.90 23.06 4.12 3.70 9.04 8.14 3.86 4.04 6.67 7.35 14.06 4.00 Zinc, ppm Standard Deviation 1.15 9.93 5.39 1.70 1.06 4.09 10.78 0.75 0.91 1.43 2.30 2.76 3.75 6.33 1.09 Low 2.00 2.64 15.55 (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) Flounder, Yellowtail Area* A G S A W H S G G A G S A A Samples analyzed0 46 10 10 11 44 21 21 23 32 10 20 32 22 29 Mean 11.00 0.93 1.54 1.04 1.27 1.44 0.94 4.02 0.90 1.12 2.23 2.00 Low 0.87 2.50 3.20 3.23 2.68 0.69 1.44 High 10.50 Area* G G S A W A A A W K W G W W Samples analyzed 10 18 14 32 41 19 17 26 26 9 14 36 31 49 Mean 0.64 0.91 1.47 3.92 1.78 8.66 4.12 Low 2.50 3.10 1.87 0.13 2.21 0.40 2.44 1.21 1.31 8.13 3.21 0.48 8.31 Area* A G S C S S S A S G G G G S Samples analyzed 8 22 20 12 29 11 15 23 9 17 11 12 36 20 Mean 6.84 5.15 5.11 7.47 5.78 8.30 5.56 5.50 10.70 10.29 4.50 3.31 2.25 4.25 3.82 4.00 2.56 7.75 9.25 11.88 5.75 13.13 2.80 3.45 Chum Area6 A S A A G S C W w C K K W K Samples analyzed\" 16 16 9 22 9 15 10 32 19 39 8 22 55 15 Mean 3.80 12.19 12.28 5.64 2.92 1.21 1.59 1.65 0.80 2.27 1.56 0.91 Low 1.82 4.82 6.62 1.12 5.54 1.43 3.37 2.50 2.29 0.00 Dover Area3 K W K K W G S S 6 S H S C W Samples analyzed0 18 25 15 22 21 28 29 10 8 16 9 25 28 38 Mean 5.52 3.03 1.25 C w C w C w s w H C C H C H A Samples analyzed0 24 40 18 36 10 37 19 10 16 10 13 16 22 15 18 Mean 0.87 0.96 2.36 0.91 1.36 1.07 2.87 1.72 2.21 1.34 1.96 Low 1.44 2.38 2.13 (Crassostrea gigas) Scallop, Calico Area S C C W A S K W A G S C W S Samples analyzed 10 8 10 27 37 9 9 26 23 36 31 19 37 20 Mean 5.23 18.11 White (Penaeus setiferus) Area6 C A 6 S W K A S G 6 G S Samples Q analyzed 21 15 15 11 28 10 16 18 27 15 19 29 resource survey, National Marine Fisheries Service, College Park, Md.

As mentioned, oysters are exceptionally high in zinc among mollusks; their mean for values shown in Table 6-1 is 202 ppm, as compared to a mean value of 12.5 ppm for clams. Crustaceans contained slightly more zinc than finfish; the mean value for crustaceans was 12.5 ppm, and means for individual species ranged from 7-57 ppm. Such results are consistent with measurements of the concentrations of 1626 zinc in shellfish from coastal areas of Scotland, and amounts of zinc found in finfish sampled from coastal and deepwater areas around England and 1266 Wales. The evidence indicates that fish regulate the concentrations of zinc in muscle tissues and that zinc levels in adult finfish do not vary greatly with age. Results are also similar for amounts of zinc reported for processed fish and crustaceans. For example, Gormican found the following zinc concentrations in processed samples: canned and salted crab, 36 ppm; uncooked frozen haddock, 3 ppm; canned sockeye salmon, 11 ppm; canned and salted shrimp, 19 ppm; 549 uncooked, frozen sole, 3 ppm; and water-packed canned tuna, 4 ppm. However, Takino reported that the average zinc content in the muscle of 34 species of 1591 fish was only about 1 ppm, with a range of zero to 2 ppm. These values are about tenfold lower than the others reported in previous literature on fin- fish. The low values and very narrow ranges makes the validity of Takino's research suspect. Mollusks. The subject of most investigations on zinc in marine animals has been mollusks. Mollusks are able to concentrate certain trace metals up 1301 to many thousands of times that level found in the environment. Fringle et al. have published extensive data on the uptake of zinc and other trace elements by several estuarine mollusks. They collected samples of shellfish at 100 144 image: ------- stations from Atlantic and Pacific waters and reported the following zinc contents: Eastern oysters accumulated about 1,428 ppm zinc on a wet weight basis, with a range between 180-4,120 ppm; amounts reported for the Pacific oyster ranged between 86-344 ppm wet weight. The mean zinc content of soft- shell clams was 17 ppm wet weight, and the range was 9-28 ppm. The northern quahog had a mean of 21 ppm wet weight and a range of 12-40 ppm. Zinc levels in shellfish along the Atlantic Coast varied from about 10-40 ppm in the case of hard- and soft-shell clams to a range between 1301 180-4,100 ppm for the Eastern oyster. But zinc levels in the Pacific oyster only reached 90-350 ppm. The high levels of zinc found in Eastern oysters suggests a possible genetic difference between Atlantic and Pacific oysters for the physiologic role of zinc. Studies on the uptake and content of zinc in soft shell clams showed that clams reached concentrations of 27 ppm in 50 days when 1487 exposed to 0.2 ppm zinc at 20 C. This uptake represented a 17 ppm increase in zinc over a period of 50 days, or 0.35 ppm zinc/kg/day. It was also found that the soft-shell clam apparently concentrates copper preferentially 1487 over zinc under identical experimental conditions. The significance of chemically polluted estuarine waters for shellfish and, by implication, public health, prompted Shuster and Pringle to obtain comprehensive data on the levels of certain chemicals in shellfish and study the uptake of trace elements by oysters. Extensive data on zinc in the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) were compiled; they are summarized in Tables 6-2 and 6-3. 145 image: ------- TABLE 6-2 Zinc Content in American Oysters from Atlantic Coast Waters Source of Data Grassestrea.virginica Zinc Content, ppm wet weight Range Mean 1301 Pringle et al.

(New Hampshire through North Carolina, 1960) 522 Galtsoff (Long Island Sound, 1933-1935) 275 studied oysters exposed to 0.1 and 0.2 ppm zinc and produced the data set forth in Table 6-3. Zinc accumulation increased with time over the 20-wk period, and oysters exposed to 0.2 ppm exhibited somewhat higher concentrations than those exposed to 0.1 ppm zinc. The highest levels observed in oysters exposed to 0.2 ppm zinc, however, were comparable to the naturally high concentrations noted in Table 6-3. 146 image: ------- TABLE 6-3 Zinc Accumulated by the Eastern Oyster in Two 20-Week Periods'2 Crassostrea -vlrgioiea 1968 1967 1968 1.036 1,708 1,036 1,708 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and Pringle. The mean levels of zinc in the oyster tissue are shown for each weekly sampling interval at two different zinc levels in experimental seawater systems. The experiment, first performed in 1967, was repeated in 1968; trends were similar, although the initial zinc content of the oysters was higher in 1968. The sample was about 200 oysters harvested from Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. 147 image: ------- Oysters lose zinc rapidly if they are transplanted into water with low 768 zinc content. A linear decrease from about 1,000 ppm to about 100 ppm over a 4-mo period was observed. Copper in oysters did not decrease until at least 2 wks after transplanting, whereas zinc started to disappear immediately after the change. 745 Huggett et al. established a high positive correlation between levels of zinc and levels of copper and cadmium in oysters from the Chesapeake Bay. Based on average values for these elements, they showed that a concentration gradient existed in oysters from all river systems emptying into the bay, and that in the oysters, each metal increased in concentration with proximity to fresh water. The concentration of heavy metals by oysters was shown to follow a predictable pattern: therefore, the oyster is usable as an index for measuring and identifying unnatural amounts of metal taken up. Although the high content of zinc in oysters has been well documented, little information is available on the biologic availability of zinc in 1478 oysters to consumers of seafood. Shah et al. reported that when rats were fed oyster-supplemented diets containing 60 pg zinc/g diet, the apparent absorption of zinc from oysters was 16.3%, an amount not significantly different from the corresponding value of 18.5% for zinc carbonate ingested by rats. Dietary levels of zinc up to 2,000 ppm from either source had no significant effect on body weight, hemoglobin, hematocrit and liver cytochrome oxidase activity after 8 wks. The concentration of zinc in various tissues was not affected by the source of zinc; however, the dietary level markedly affected the concentration of zinc in all tissues examined 148 image: ------- except muscle and hair. A homeostatic control of the intestinal absorption of zinc was demonstrated when the fraction of dietary zinc deposited in rat femurs was found to decrease markedly with increasing dietary concentrations. The homeostatic mechanism that regulated absorption of zinc appeared to be overcome at a dietary level between 275-1,550 yg/g because the skeletal load of zinc increased at a dietary level of 1,550 ug/g but not at 275 ^ig/g or less.1478 Crustaceans. The zinc content of crustaceans has been studied less than that of moHusks. The zinc content of several whole decapod crustaceans is rather 186 consistent and ranged from 20-50 yg/g (Table 6-4). The overall similarity among the values from different animals suggested that the concentrations of zinc and copper are probably regulated in all decapods. In Homarus, Carcinus, Cancer and Maja, zinc is found mainly in the blood plasma, rather than in 189 the blood cells, where most of it is bound to proteins in the plasma. The concentration of zinc in the blood is regulated at different values in different species of crustaceans, as listed in Table 6-5. Variations between individuals of the same species appear to be related to the amount of protein in the blood. As Table 6-5 shows, wide differences exist among samples of muscle from different species. Evidence indicates that t' s sine content of a muscle may be related to the speed with which it can contract. For example, the muscles that contract quickly in Homarus contain about 15 Vg/g zinc, whereas muscles / 191 that contract slowly contain about 100 pg/g. An indication of the permeability of slow and fast muscles in crustaceans was obtained by measuring concentrations of zinc-65 in lobsters kept in sea 186 water to which the isotope was added. The concentrations of zinc-65 (expressed as muscle:blood ratios) in slow muscle were about twice those of 149 image: ------- TABT.E 6-4 Mean Concentrations of Zinc and Copper in Whole Decapod Crustaceans'2 Species Shrimp 3 3 6 1 2 7 3 Concentration, Ug/g Solid Content, % 27.0 29.7 24.9 28.6 34.9 28.6 32.7 44.5 wet weight Zinc 21 30 20 34 23 24 18 54 tissue Copper 30 31 32 32 33\u00b0 17 29 27 Hermit Crab Eupagurus bernhardus 30.2 282 Crabs 33.9 31.6 28.6 34.6 36.6 33.8 39 32 27 27 21 22 26 49 21 22 10 20 21 18 22 20 28 25 a Data from Bryan.186 \" Females with extenu \u00b0 Mean of 10 animals. eggs, 150 image: ------- fast muscle, suggesting that slow muscle is more permeable to zinc. The nature of the differences in concentrations of zinc between the two types of muscle is not known. This feature, however, suggests that lobster, and presumably other decapod crustaceans, would be suitable organisms for determining how zinc functions in the muscles of crustaceans. Concentrations of zinc in the hepatopancreas vary from species to species, but usually lie within the range of 30-90 yg/g (see Table 6-5). In Homarus, dietary zinc is rapidly absorbed and the concentration increases in the blood and hepatopancreas. It is thought that the zinc stored in the hepatopancreas of Homarus is not removed in the feces. Rather, it is lost across the body 193 surface or gradually lost into the blood and then excreted in the urine. The amount of zinc which can be absorbed directly from seawater across the body surface of decapod crustaceans increases if the concentration in the water is raised. Therefore, species living in fairly clean water will absorb less zinc from the water than species living in a polluted water where the concentration is higher. However, variation in the dietary intake is probably 186 more important. Freshwater Animals Data on the content of zinc in freshwater animals are limited, but it seems that the levels in freshwater fish are not markedly different from amounts found in marine animals. The concentration of zinc and 12 other elements was measured in a limited study of dressed fish from nonindustrialized and heavily industrialized fresh- 1648 water areas around the Great Lakes. All samples were composite, consisting of at least 2.25 kg or 3 fish. No major differences were detected between 151 image: ------- TABLE 6-5 Mean Concentrations of Zinc in Body Fluids and Tissues of Decapod Crustaceans\u2014 Ul 10 6 6 6 2 4 6 5 3 5 3 5 5 3 11 3 3 Blood 38 87 23 3.1 7.4 0.9 0.25 11.6 11.0 9.5 49 7 1.8 36 12.3 2.4 Leg Muscles 66 60 36 52 61 64 28 15 44 63 Abdominal Muscles 10 14 14 20 15 12 10 24 Stomach Fluid 48 0.7 41 47 26 12 6 15 15 13 18 92 31 Hepato- pancreas 64 65 78 97 34 109 49 69 50 88 45 42 24 56 169 71 Urine MHM^MM^^B 0.6 2.2 0.02 1.4 0.6 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.3 image: ------- TABLE 6-5 of Animals 6 6 6 2 4 6 5 3 5 3 5 5 3 11 3 3 are from Excretory Organs 20 20 7 23 16 29 29 10 8 19 15 English waters.

Lake whitefish and northern pike from the nonindustralized Moose Lake area had 14 and 19 ppm zinc, respectively. Their counterparts in parts of Lake Ontario and Lake St. Pierre affected by industry had incorporated 12 ppm and 19 ppm zinc. Northern pike, rainbow smelt, and yellow perch around industralized 1648 areas of Lake Erie had absorbed 10, 20, and 12 ppm zinc, respectively. Lucas et al. also investigated the concentration of zinc and other 954 trace elements in fish from the Great Lakes. They studied the content of zinc and 14 other trace elements in 40 liver samples from 10 species of fish from Lakes Michigan, Superior, and Erie. The levels of zinc varied littie.between species and the range was 11-48 ppm. This range is somewhat higher than the range (3-24 ppm) reported in Table 6-1 for mean concentrations of zinc in marine samples. 154 image: ------- Concentration of Radioactive Zinc Levels of zinc-65 have been studied in marine organisms mainly for 1215 their relation to discharges from nuclear reactors. Pearcy and Osterberg investigated the major y-emitting radioisotopes found in the livers of albacore (Thunnus alalunga) along the west coast of North America from 1962-1965. The zinc-65 content of albacore livers from southern California and Baja California. ranged from 10-100 pCi/g, which was about 10% of the levels found in samples off Oregon and Washington. The highest levels of zinc-65 were found in samples taken off northern Oregon and Washington, and those levels increased markedly during the summer. The data suggest that albacore rapidly accumulate zinc-65 after they migrate into Oregon waters. It was concluded that radioactivity from the Columbia River significantly affects the zinc-65 content of migratory albacore tuna. Zinc-65 content and specific activity in albacore tended to be higher in fish taken nearer the mouth of the Columbia River and in those taken in the 1215 summer and fall months. The levels of zinc-65 in benthic invertebrates of the Oregon coast 231 have been reviewed by Carey. Zinc-65 and other artificial radioisotopes in the marine environment off the northwest coast of the United States come from activation of naturally occurring stable elements and from corrosion of reactor parts within the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) reactor at Hanford, Washington. Marine benthic fauna concentrate zinc-65 and the concentration 232 changes markedly with depth. Rapid decreases generally occur within the first 400 m of depth. 155 image: ------- 1290 Preston reported that the rate of discharge of zinc-65 by a nuclear power station in Essex, England, is based on the amount of the metal that accumulates in oysters in the surrounding area. The rate of discharge of zinc-65 is restricted specifically because of its high concentration in oyster flesh. Assuming maximum human consumption of oyster flesh of 75 g/day over the whole year, the calculated permissible level for oyster flesh was calculated to be about 2,900 pCi/g. Because it had been shown that the concentration factors (concentration of zinc-65 accumulated in organism tissue) for zinc concentration of zinc-65 in seawater 275 tended to increase as the level of zinc in the seawater decreased, Preston was able to suggest that the accumulation of zinc-65 in oysters could be 1290 limited by adding inactive zinc to seawater. Studies on the stable zinc concentration in oysters before opening the Essex power plant reported a mean of 367 ppm, with a range of 308-419 ppm, whereas when the power plant was operating the mean was 834 ppm, with a range of 388-1,230 ppm. These data indicated that zinc levels had risen, perhaps caused by the zinc in the pipework of the power station's condenser cooling water system. 156 image: ------- ZINC METABOLISM IN AQUATIC ANIMALS Mo Husks Oysters. The accumulation of zinc by various members of the family Ostreidae received attention over half a century ago, 36\u00bb70^ ^ut that interest was generated primarily by the undesirable phenomenon of \"greening\" in commercial oysters, the outcome of excessive tissue concentrations of metallic elements, 521 522 particularly copper. ' More recently, the accumulation by oysters of zinc-65 from nuclear fallout475'1097'1797 or reactor effluents1290'1397'1477'1738 renewed interest in studying zinc metabolism in oysters and other organisms. It has been found that oysters may concentrate zinc to levels greater than 275 1290 1797 100,000 times the ambient concentrations in seawater, ' ' and an inverse relationship was demonstrated between this concentration factor and the zinc concentration in seawater, suggesting a limiting or regulatory 275,1290 process. This mechanism may exist because of the limited number of 1223 zinc-binding sites on structural proteins. Curiously, replotting the data reported reveals a strong linear log-log correlation between \"equilibrium zinc concentrations\" in oysters and seawater, a correlation that might be 275,1290 expected from a simple adsorption mechanism. Zinc is not strongly localized in particular organs or tissues of 312 768 1797 oysters; ' ' nor are there great differences in the molar ratios of 312 calcium, magnesium, sodium or potassium compared to zinc in any tissues. External tissues such as mantle, gills, and labial palps tend to contain more zinc than do internal tissues; adductor muscle tissue usually contains 157 image: ------- the least. In all tissues, zinc commonly is found with nuclear and cell debris and with cell sap or cytoplasm, rather than being localized in either microsomal 312,1361,1800 or mitochondrial fractions. However, in none of these studies was the relative concentration of zinc determined in any of the subcellular fractions. Nearly all soluble zinc in supernatant preparations from homogenized oyster tissues is bound to proteins of high molecular weight, as experiments 1361,1800 with gel-diffusion chromatography have shown. Dialysis of whole 312,1361 1800 oyster tissue homogenates or soluble extracts, however, removes about 95% of the zinc. Therefore, the zinc may be very weakly bound and readily dissociated from the protein moieties. Based on the observation that removing 95% of the zinc present had no effect on the activity of alkaline 1800 phosphatase, Wolfe concluded that most of the zinc in oysters was superfluous to the biochemical or nutritional requirements of the organism. Similarly, calculations of the zinc requirements of the oyster based on enzyme-specific activities and zinc stoichiometry recorded for zinc enzymes purified from other biologic systems amount to a small fraction (about 0.1%) 312 1224 of the total zinc present in oysters. ' Of the enzymes demonstrated to be zinc metalloenzymes in other systems, only four (carbonic anhydrase, alkaline phosphatase, carboxypeptidase A, and Crassostrea virginica. Alpha- D-Mannosidase, a for a gastropod 1520 312 mollusk (the limpet), was also abundant carboxypeptidase not detected in whole tissue homogenates or subcellular fractions from either species of oyster. 158 image: ------- Two hypotheses\u2014both related to the metabolism of calcium\u2014have been offered to explain the high zinc concentrations found in oysters. The first postulates that zinc may be assimilated from the environment coincidentally with calcium by a relatively nonspecific ion transport mechanism to satisfy the organism's large calcium requirements for shell deposition.1800 Moreover, at the mantle and shell interface, effective ionic discrimination occurs, such that calcium is deposited in the shell and zinc remains loosely bound to available sites in the soft tissues. According to the second hypothesis, zinc would have to be accumulated selectively and actively to overcome the com- petitive action of calcium and maintain the vital functions dependent upon zinc, especially the activities of carbonic anhydrase and alkaline phosphatase, 312 which are necessary for shell formation. This possible zinc-calcium interaction also may be studied by considering research on the dependency of relative ion composition of oyster tissues on 745 746 salinity and relative turnover rates of zinc and calcium. ' Because calcium content of seawater is directly correlated with salinity and zinc content is not, significant differences in zinc concentration or turnover as a function of salinity would be expected for either of the mechanisms proposed above. To satisfy the first hypothesis, the zinc concentration would have to increase at reduced salinities, because the calcium-assimilative transport system presumably would have to work harder to maintain sufficient calcium reserves for shell deposition. Conversely, if the second hypothesis is correct, reduced zinc turnover and concentration in oysters at lower salinities would be expected because of the decreased competition from environmental 159 image: ------- calcium. To date, only one experimental study has been conducted in which the effects of salinity were separated from the influences of other significant environmental variables. Duke et al. studied zinc-65 accumulation by Crassostrea virginica and other estuarine organisms in a multifactorial experiment in which salinity, stable zinc, pH and temperature were each tested at two different levels for accumulation over 15 days. The effect of salinity, tested at 25 and 30 ppt, was significantly inverse: that is, zinc-65 accumulation was about 10% lower at the higher salinity. An inverse salinity effect was also noted on the contents of 1383 manganese and magnesium plus strontium in shells, implying that the oyster accepts less preferred ions for shell construction when subjected to lower environmental calcium concentrations. Copper and zinc were analyzed in oysters (Crassostrea virginica) from various stations in the Newport River in North Carolina, and the Rappahannock River in Virginia. Higher concentrations of copper and zinc were found in animals living in fresher waters as had been shown previously for oysters 746 in the James, York, and Rappahannock estuaries in Virginia. For example, in the Newport River estuary, oysters living at about 12 ppt salinity contained a mean of 320 ppm zinc wet weight, whereas oysters at 32 ppt contained about 130 ppm zinc. The concentrations of zinc in unfiltered water samples from 339 this same estuary were constant, irrespective of salinity, implying that the concentration gradient found in the oysters does not result from a similar gradient in the water. 160 image: ------- The biologic turnover of zinc by oysters and other aquatic organisms is summarized in Table 6-6. The most reliable data on zinc turnover in oysters are from Seymour's studies conducted in the natural environment for two years.1476 These data, summarized in Table 6-6, were recently analyzed o / *7 again by Cutshall, who showed that both the accumulation and loss data were described by simple first-order exponentials with similar rate constants. The effective half-life for zinc-65 turnover was 135 days, and .the corresponding biologic half-life was 300 days. Thus, once accumulated by oysters, zinc is retained very effectively. 161 image: ------- TABLE 6-6 Zinc Turnover in Aquatic Organisms Species days 300 days 650 days 40 days Q 15 C 25 days @ 25 C 23 days @ 30 C 60-270 days 38 days 30-38 days 140 days 140 days @ 3 C 100 days @ 7 C 90 days @ 12 C 75 days @ 10 C 58 days @ 20 C 35 days @ 30 C 295-313 days 6.5 days Up to 20-day zinc-65 uptake; in laboratory; animals unfed Columbia River zinc-65; life-long accumulation, one year of loss in natural environment Columbia.River zinc-65; life-long accumulation; 2 years of loss in natural environment ' Single injection of zinc-65; loss to synthetic running pondwater Unspecified, but turnovers correlated positively with zinc concentration of seawater Injection of zinc-65; loss into seawater contain- ing 100 ug/1 zinc; periodic feeding Single feeding of zinc-65; loss into unlabeled freshwater; stable zinc in food increases turnover 15-day feeding period with \u00abinc-65 labeled Artemia nauplii; from seawater; 29- day loss period; data obtained with and without sediment were combined 267-day zinc-65; accumulation from seawater; 91- day loss period Single intraperitoneal injection of zinc-65; loss to clean seawater aDerived from van Weers.1674 Derived from Young and Bryan Bryan; *'2 also Table 6-5. ^Derived Fowler et al.502 ^Derived from Cross e al. ^Derived from Mishuma 162 image: ------- Marine mussela and scallops. Mytilus has been used extensively as an indicator of radioactive contamination because of its local abundance and worldwide distribution; consequently, considerable attention has been focused on zinc metabolism in this organism. Values for zinc turnover have been obtained for , they are listed for the first two species 826 in Table 6-6. Keckes et al. demonstrated conclusively that the experimental determination of short-term turnover rates using zinc-65 and resolution of turnover into differing rate constants depended heavily upon the duration of exposure of the organism to zinc-65. From these observations, it is evident that many mechanisms interact to produce zinc turnover, and that long exposure periods are necessary for valid measures of elemental turnover in radioisotopic 347 loss experiments. This relationship is discussed theoretically by Cutshall; it is evident specifically in comparisons of the data from experimental 826,1674 exposures of various short durations, and in data from lifelong exposure to zinc-65, which suggested only a single long-lived component when zinc-65 was lost by Mytilus. Unlike oysters, where zinc is generally found in most tissues, zinc is strongly localized in certain tissues of Mytilus. Tissue concentrations of zinc in Mytilus edulis aoteanus have been reported in the order of visceral 168 1223 mass > gills > gonads > mantle > muscle = foot = shell. Pentreath found visceral mass > adductor muscle > gonad > mantle = foot = gill. The distribution of zinc-65 fallout was examined in Mytilus californianus, where half the total zinc-65 was found in the kidney tissues constituting about 1% of the total weigh; an additional 19% of the isotope was discerned in the digestive 163 image: ------- glands representing less than 4% of the weight of Mytilus. Only 4% of the zinc-65 was in the shells, which constitute about 70% of the weight. Presumably, 168 1222 the \"visceral mass\" measurements just noted ' include kidney tissue. The localization of zinc in the kidneys was confirmed by autoradiography of 1674 zinc-65 accumulated experimentally. However, in a related species of Mytiltdae, Modiolus modiolus, rather uniform zinc concentrations were found in gonad, mantle and gills, gut, and digestive gland, and they were 2-2.8 times 1467 higher than that in muscle tissue. Although it is possible that zinc metabolism varies from species to species, it is more likely that greater care should have been exercised during dissection to demonstrate the specific tissue distribution of zinc. Scallops (Pectenidae) also show strong tissue localizations of metals, including zinc. Again, kidney tissue exhibits highest concentrations of zinc, 10-100 times the concentration for the total soft parts, in Pecten novae- 168 190 zelandiae, Pecten maximus L., and Chlamys opercularis L. High zinc concentrations in the kidneys usually are accompanied by high concentrations of manganese and iron168,190,1422,1467 Some of thft data190 show similar relationships between kidneys and the various other tissues which also hold true for cdbalt, copper, nickel, and lead, which are summarized in Table 6-7. Although metal concentrations were usually highest in kidneys, the digestive gland frequently contained a significant portion of the total metal present in the scallop, because the kidney is such a small organ. Seasonal fluctua- tions were evident in the kidney and digestive gland: zinc and manganese concentrations were maximal in late autumn and winter and minimal during 164 image: ------- TABLE 6-7 Relative Content of Metals in Different Scallop Tissues .a Metal, %b Aluminum Cadmium Chromium Cobalt Copper i-* gj Iron Lead Manganese Nickel Silver Zinc Gills \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 6.7 5.3 5.7 3.1 3.1 7.2 \u2014 3.0 Pecten Mantle \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 8.8 4.4 7.4 5.4 1.2 7.9 \u2014 3.6 maximus L.

Bryan suggested that seasonal variations may be caused by the reproductive cycle, temperature, availability of food, and land drainage; he surmised that elemental changes in the kidney were independent of the reproductive state of the gonads, and that changes in phytoplankton productivity were probably more important than either temperature or runoff. Generally^ periods of highest productivity coincided with lowest metal concentrations in scallop tissues. Bryan further reasoned that the greater availability of phytoplanktonic food would increase the metabolic rate of the scallop and hence the excretion of waste products; reduce the amount of metal left available in the water; and diminish the metal concentra- tion per phytoplankton cell, thereby decreasing metal intake of the scallop despite the additional food ingestion. Freshwater bivalves. Freshwater bivalves are well known for their concentration of manganese, ' generally accompanied by a lower concentration of 6^7 A^R ftAfi zinc. ' ' As in the scallops, these metals are unevenly distributed among the tissues of unionid bivalves. Anodonta nuttaliiana Lea has a mass of tissue in which approximately 25% of the dry weight is composed of calcium. This calcareous tissue contains metal-rich granules 2 ym in size, and is present as an elongated white area on the surface of the mantle near the C.\"1~J attachment of the gills. Radionuclides of manganese, cobalt, zinc and lead are rapidly accumulated to high levels in this tissue, whereas accumulated radionuclides of scandium, chromium, iron, europium, tantalum, and mercury were f.\"3Q found in the organs of the digestive system. After 147 days of accumulation, the gonad and foot of the clam appeared to have equilibrated with both zinc-65 and manganese-54, but the mantle and calcareous tissue were still accumulating isotopes at an exponential rate. 166 image: ------- The biologic half-time for turnover in the large, long-lived pool 638 in Anodonta was about 1,300 days for manganese and 650 days for zinc. Of the total zinc-65 accumulated in 35 days, about 35% was in the calcareous tissue, whereas the proportion of stable zinc in this tissue was 42% in small clams (in which average wet weight of tissue was 15 g) , and about 58% in large 637 clams (where wet weight averaged 45 g or more). 1214 In similar studies with Anodonta californiensis. Pauley and Nakatani found that zinc-65 was associated predominantly with mantle and gill tissue, but they did not distinguish calcareous tissue. Nor did their autoradiographic 637 techniques identify the granules observed by Harrison. Instead the auto- radiography showed highest localizations of zinc-65 in the base and tip of the outer mantle epithelium, the tips of the gill epithelial cells, and the epithelial cells of the kidney. It seems probable that Pauley and Nakatani simply included the calcareous tissue either with gills or mantle tissue, and they probably did not section the organism through this region. A similar judgment may be applied to the distribution of zinc-65 in tissue of 1024 Margaritifera margaritifera. In studies of whole animals, rapid equilibra- 183,648,1024 tion with zinc-65 has been noted for several species of unionids. 637 But the slow turnover and high concentrations of zinc in the calcareous tissue, probably thwarted the achievement of true equilibration, and some of the biologic 648,1024 f s half-lives obtained are probably not representative of zinc turnover in these species. 167 image: was accumulated to much higher concentrations in soft parts than in the shell, 183 but tissue distribution was not studied. Unborn embryonic snails contained a higher concentration of zinc-65 than did the adults collected at the same time from the experimental pond, suggesting that zinc mobilization into the gonads and internally developing embryos is rapid compared to turnover in some other organs of the adult snail. Stable zinc was not analyzed in this study; 183 therefore, dynamics of zinc turnover were not well defined. Calcium accumulation and turnover were studied in the pulmonate 1678 Lymnaea stagnalis. Calcium was pumped against a concentration gradient by this gastropod from low concentrations in the water ( < 1 rag calcium/1). The calcium transport system was directly affected by temperature; the rate of calcium uptake showed a Qin* of ^\"^ between 6 C and 16 C and 3.0 between 16 C and 30 C. At least two rate components were resolved for calcium exchange between Lymnaea and the medium. Although zinc was not measured in this study, it is mentioned here because of the implied relationship in oysters between calcium metabolism and the bioaccumulation of metals like zinc and manganese, which was discussed in the section on oysters. Crustaceans Zinc-65 was assimilated with about 56% efficiency from ingested food (zinc-65-labeled Artemia) by the gammarid amphipod Anonyx and retention of 338 the isotope was affected significantly by feeding and deprivation. Amphipods starved during the 3-wk loss period exhibited a mean biologic half-life Increase in rate of chemical reaction for each 10 C increase in temperature. 168 image: ------- for zinc of about 100 days, compared to about 35 days for animals on a brine shrimp diet. Similar effects of controlling the food allowance on zinc-65 turnover were observed in marine Idothea1160 and crabs.192 Turnover of zinc by Anonyx was also directly related to temperature; biologic half-life for 338 zinc turnover was about 92 days at 12 C and about 150 days at 3 C. Similar effects of temperature were also noted with the isopod Idothea, with the euphausids Euphausia Autoradiography of crustacean tissues indicates that zinc-65 is located primarily in the interstitial spaces between muscle fibers, in the eye mainly between the rhabdoms and cystalline cones of adjacent ommatidia, within and on the interior surface of the exoskeleton, regardless of whether the 340 503 isotope was accumulated directly from water ' or assimilated from labeled food. In euphausids, the prawn Pasiphaea pacifica and shrimp Pandalus tended to concentrate zinc-65 accumulated from water more in the exoskeleton and less in muscle than when the isotope was accumulated from food. In all cases, however, the exoskeletons contained 30-66% of the accumulated zinc-65. The turnover of zinc by growing crustaceans was not readily studied in short-term zinc-65 loss experiments because a mean of 41% of the body burden of zinc-65 was lost with the molted exoskeletons after zinc-65 accumulation from 503 water. In long-term loss experiments after ingestion of zinc-65-labeled food, however, only 1% of the body burden was excreted with each molted 502 exoskeleton. This finding corresponded to the earlier radioautographic observations that zinc-65 accumulated from water tended to be associated 169 image: ------- with interstitial spaces in the calcified cuticle of the exoskeleton, whereas ingested zinc-65 was more localized on the underside of these cuticular 340,501,503 layers . 501 Fowler et al. speculated that the localization of zinc in euphausid eyes might be associated with melanin pigments in the distal and proximal screening pigment cells that closely surround the cones and rhabdoms of 814 euphausid eyes. Zinc also may be required the enzyme retinene dehy- drogenase, which catalyzes the oxidation (retinol) to vitamin A aldehyde (retinene) . Zinc is 1664 many other nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) -dependent enzymes. Based on the above mentioned research on zinc-65 accumulation and turnover in euphausids, and studies of zinc-65 accumulation by Euphausia pacifica under conditions simulating those which euphausids would encounter if they migrated vertically in and out of a zinc-65-labeled mixed surface 1499 layer of the ocean at different seasons in temperate latitudes, the 1501 turnover of zinc by the single euphausid Hegany ct iphanes norvegica 1500 as well as by total populations of this organism in the Mediterranean region was estimated. Flux of zinc through Meganyctiphanes norvegica was presumed to follow a linear model where: Pe + 170 image: ------- in ingested food (i), new tissue added in growth C.6), feces (f_), molts (m), dead carcasses (c), and nonviable eggs (x); and p\u00b1 p6, pf, pm, PC, and px are the rates of ingestion (i) and growth (6 ), and the respective rates of production of f eces (f), molts (m), dead carcasses (c) , and nonviable eggs (x). For adult animals feeding and defecating 12 h/day, zinc ingestion rate (K ) was estimated as 51-130 yg zinc ingested/g dry weight/day, depending on whether maximal or minimal values of the other concentrations and rates were used. The zinc concentration in the food of Meganyctiphanes norvegica would have to be 400-450 yg zinc/g dry weight to satisfy the elimination and growth rates of the model. Because zinc measured in Arte^-fa fed to Meganyctiphanes norvegica in the laboratory (417 + 103 yg zinc/g dry weight) and in natural plankton mixtures consisting of 95% small copepods plus phytoplank- ton, flagellates,and detritus (570 + 113 yg zinc/g dry weight) hewed closely to the calculated estimate, the zinc budget for Meganyctiphanes norvegica was believed to be described adequately. Fecal pellet deposition represented over 90% of the total zinc flux from the organism. For the Ligurian Sea, the entire pool of ionic zinc in the water would be circulated through the Meganyctiphanes norvegica population in 500-1,200 yr, depending on the dietary 1500 availability of zinc. Furthermore, zinc would be effectively transported downward from the surface waters by sinking fecal pellets, molts, and carcasses generated by the vertically-migrating euphausid population during daylight hours. Daily net transport of 36-98% of the pool of body zinc in Meganyctiphanes norveeiea would occur to a depth of 500 m, depending on whether food availability was marginal or sufficient, and at least 6% of the body zinc pool would reach 2,500 m daily. 171 image: ------- 1183 Osterberg et al. attempted to correlate the distribution of several radionuclides including zinc-65 with the exposed surface areas of macroplanktonic organisms, and concluded that surface adsorption played a relatively insignificant 503 role in the bioaccumulation of the nuclides. Yet Fowler et al. found that weight-specific uptake and elimination of zinc-65 were statistically similar between live and formalin-preserved euphausids over a range of temperatures and zinc-65 concentrations. In euphausids which apparently do not regulate zinc concentrations in tissue, the turnover and steady-state concentrations of zinc probably depend entirely on the number and affinities of internal 502 binding sites for the metal. A similar hypothesis also was suggested for zinc concentration and turnover in oysters. In large decapod Crustacea (crabs, lobsters, and crayfish), zinc concentrations in the body are controlled by mechanisms regulating zinc absorp- 1 Of. tion through the gills and zinc loss in the urine and across the body surface. ' 191-193 The following discussion is derived from Bryan's reviews of zinc metabolism in decapods. The zinc concentration in blood of lobsters (Homarus vulgaris) from waters containing about 5 yg zinc/1 is similar to the value of 5.6 yg zinc/g 376 given for human blood. Whereas in human blood about 90% of the zinc is found in the erythrocytes and leukocytes, in lobster blood 93% of the zinc is in the serum. As in vertebrates, this zinc appears to be bound to blood protein^ which in the lobster is principally the copper protein, hemocyanin. Normal hematic zinc concentration is highest in lobsters that have more hemocyanin, measured by high contents of copper and solids in the blood. In normal male lobsters, the highest concentration of zinc is found in the hepatopancreas: about 25 ug/g. High zinc concentrations were not 172 image: ------- found to be associated with the male reproductive system in the lobster (fhe vas deferens contains about 13 yg/g). But the highest zinc concentrations in normal female lobsters were found in the ovary, which contains up to 50 pg/g. No other obvious differences between the sexes were observed. Zinc concentra- tions in normal lobsters are relatively low compared to vertebrates, but are very similar to the zinc concentrations of 20 yg/g found in whole shrimp 136,1209 and crabs. 193 Bryan has showed that zinc concentrations in most lobster tissues are quite accurately controlled. Except in the hepatopancreas, variations produced by zinc injections were rectified quite rapidly. In muscle tissue and gonads no changes were induced by zinc injections, suggesting that these organs are either almost impermeable to zinc or that zinc regulation is particularly good. The process of zinc regulation in the freshwater crayfish (Austropota- mobius pallipes) differs from that in the marine lobster Homarus because most crayfish tissues contain less zinc than those of the lobster, but the concentrations in the hepatopancreas and stomach fluid are much higher. Concentrations in the main abdominal flexor muscles are similar in the two species, however, and zinc concentrations in muscle are fairly constant under different conditions. In both species, muscle is the tissue responding least to changes in the blood concentration of zinc, although zinc exchange does 193 occur. Crayfish blood contains less zinc than the blood of any marine decapod crustaceans that have been examined, although in estuarine species blood zinc was higher than in marine species. The blood concentrations of zinc do not increase in crayfish, despite high concentrations of blood protein and copper which tend to increase amounts of zinc in Homarus. Zinc is bound 173 image: ------- to proteins in the blood, but binding to the variable hemocyanin component may be less important for crayfish. Low zinc concentrations for crayfish have been found consistently in the excretory organs and urine. The excretory system appears to be unimportant in regulating zinc, although it certainly prevents zinc loss. The permeability of the body surface to zinc is low and therefore zinc losses are small. Similarly, very little zinc is absorbed across the body surface from solution. In contrast, Homarus absorbs and loses zinc across the body surface, apparently in a controlled manner. Urinary losses in Homarus are also closely controlled, yet they can 192 be appreciable. Both species are likely to obtain excess zinc from food, and it is the major source of zinc for the crayfish. Excess zinc is absorbed rapidly from the stomach fluid in Homarus, partly by the hepatopancreas, and concentrations will increase in all tissues except muscle, gonads and exoskeleton. Uptake from the stomach fluid of the crayfish is slower, and all the zinc is absorbed by the hepatopancreas before affecting the other tissues. If zinc penetrates directly from the stomach of the crayfish into the blood, it is removed so rapidly by the hepatopancreas that no obvious change in blood concentration is seen. When excess zinc was injected into crayfish blood, all the excess zinc.was absorbed by the hepatopancreas in a few days and some of it was transferred to the stomach fluid. When excess zinc was injected into Homarus, some was removed in the urine, some was lost across the body surface, and as in the crayfish, an appreciable amount was removed by the hepatopancreas. Whereas in the crayfish excess zinc in the hepatopancreas and stomach fluid 174 image: ------- was lost in the feces, in Homa.rus excess zinc in the hepatopancreas was eventually lost by blood, excretory organs, or body surface.192 The amount of zinc absorbed directly from sea water across the body surface of decapod crustacea varies with the zinc concentration in the water. Hence species living in fairly clean water away from the coast will absorb less zinc from the water than species living in lightly polluted estuaries. Variation in the dietary intake of these metals is, however, probably much more important. Animals which feed on worms from sediments may take in considerable zinc and copper. Although the intake of metals may be highly variable, the concentrations of zinc and copper in the majority of species lie between 20 and 35 yg/g. Therefore, it seems likely that zinc regulation occurs in all species of decapod crustaceans. Zinc is bound so tightly by the proteins in the blood that even in waters containing only a few yg/1 of zinc, the concentration gradient for unbound zinc points toward penetration from the water to the blood through the gills. The amount of zinc absorbed in this way increases as the external concentration is increased, indicating that the proteins in the blood to which zinc binds 189 are not normally saturated. So far, no unequivocal evidence has been obtained to show whether or not absorption via the gills is an active or controlled process. Decapod crustaceans probably receive more zinc than they require, and thus processes for removing extra zinc probably are more important than measures for its absorption. The removal of zinc from the body can occur through the feces, urine, or across the body surface. Losses in the feces depend on whether the animal is feeding and how much zinc is in the stomach fluid. In Homarus, for example, the zinc concentration in stomach fluid is 175 image: ------- usually less than 1 ug/g and losses In the feces are very small. In freshwater 192 crayfish, almost all losses of zinc occur in the feces. The ability to regulate the concentration of zinc\u2014and perhaps the concentration of copper\u2014in the body may give decapod crustaceans a degree of protection in regions where metal pollution is found. The concentrations of zinc and copper in muscle tissue are unlikely to vary, but the hepatopancreas \u00b0f Cancer pagurus (which is consumed by humans) would probably yield higher 186 concentrations of metal in polluted regions. Polychaetes in the Newport River estuary 339 In a study of manganese, iron, and zinc/in North Carolina, Cross et al. found that three polychaete worms (Glycera americana, Diopatra cuprea and Amphitrite ornata) showed similar concentrations of metals regardless of large differences in metal concentrations of the sediments in which the worms were burrowing and feeding. Therefore they suggested that these species may regulate 195 body concentrations of trace metals. Bryan and Hummerstone examined Nereis diversicolor, a species closely related to Glycera, and found that whereas the concentration of copper was roughly proportional to that of the surrounding sediment) zinc appeared to be regulated independently of the zinc level in 194 the sediment. It subsequently was found that zinc in Nereis varied by a factor of only 2.7 although they were living in sediments where zinc concentra- tions varied by a factor of about 30. In these same samples, concentrations of cadmium in the worms were roughly proportional to those in the sediments, indicating that cadmium\u2014like topper\u2014was probably not regulated, whereas zinc was. In experiments to induce toxicosis, worms from sediments high in 176 image: ------- zinc were more resistant to zinc than were normal worms. This adaptation of Nereis was ascribed to a reduced permeability to zinc and more effective excretion.194 Fish Theoretical considerations of limited experimental evidence show that fish must obtain zinc from their dietary intakes rather 726 1222 than through exchange with dissolved zinc in the aqueous medium. ' This conclusion was deduced from the observation that turnover rates of larger body pools of zinc cannot be sustained by inflow rates of zinc from water alone. Such a conclusion again points to the shortcomings of turnover rates estimated from short periods of exposure to radioactive zinc. Estimates of zinc turnover in fish are listed in Table 6-6, along with certain aspects of the experimental approach. Longer turnover times are obtained naturally when the fish are 1332a,1679,1680 exposed for long periods to zinc-65 in the natural environment. Similarly, the use of short-term exposures of fish to experimental dissolved zinc concentrations in tests for acute toxicosis is of questionable significance. This practice usually provides estimates of lethal levels that can cause death through tissue hypoxia from direct gill damage or precipitation of gill secretions. Under these experimental circumstances, the organisms die before their body pools have equilibrated with the environmental level of zinc, and the significant lethal or sublethal physiologic effects of longer term exposure tend not to be studied. Zinc concentrations in whole fish are a function of age in certain 337 species, at least in juvenile stages. In croakers image: ------- concentrations decreased as an exponential function of weight over the range of 0.01-5 g dry weight for the whole fish. In adult bathyal-demersal morids (Antimora rostrata), zinc concentration in white muscle also decreased slightly with size between 200-1,400 g total live weight, but zinc concentration was independent of fish size in muscle of bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) between I/ \"I 400-4,500 g. In freshwater carp, the initial zinc concentration in roe decreased with the age of the female, although after gastrulation the zinc 1389 concentrations in the larval fish were similar regardless of the parent's age. Tissue distribution of zinc-65 in yearling trout was observed after oral administration of a single dose of radioisotope contained in a force-fed gelatin capsule. Initial high blood concentrations of zinc-65 declined exponentially after 1 day, whereas the isotope was retained for 2-3 days in kidney, spleen, and liver and continued to increase in gills through the fifth day. Muscle, bone, and eye tissues appeared to have equilibrated with zinc-65 by the fifth day and were retaining the isotope more effectively than the other tissues, albeit at a lower concentration than gills, kidneys, or spleen. This experiment suggests that zinc elimination from fish may occur both through urine and gills. The daily flux of manganese, iron, copper, and zinc was estimated for populations of Atlantic menhaden, spot and pinfish for the summer months in 342 the Newport River estuary in North Carolina. Assimilation efficiencies of these metals by fish were highly variable and dependent on the trace metal concentration in inorganic content of ingested materials. Except for zinc in menhaden and pinfish, assimilation efficiencies were less than 10%. Because a significant fraction of the trace metal ingested is not assimilated, defecation 178 image: ------- of unassimilated trace metals by these fish may be a major biologic process in cycling trace metals in highly productive coastal plain estuaries. By comparing analyses of manganese, iron, and zinc in estuarine organisms, sediments and water, Wolfe et al. 1801 estimated the fluxes of these metals through and within the Newport River estuary and a descriptive model was constructed for the annual movement of zinc in that estuary.1798 Zinc appears to be retained very effectively in coastal plain estuaries: sediment and detritus reservoirs are large, and efficient recycling occurs through the living organisms. This model was subsequently examined-'-7\" for sensitivity of the major zinc flows around the detritus compartment toward the other conditions, either measured or assumed, used in the development of the model. The model was most sensitive to phytoplankton incorporation of zinc, microbial zinc assimilation within the detritus compartment, and macrofaunal standing crop, production, and assimilation of zinc. The model was insensitive to changes in Spartina productivity, phytoplankton standing crop, zooplankton standing crop, and productivity and estuarine flushing rate. It is still poorly understood how zinc adsorbed on sediments or incorporated in detritus becomes remineralized and available again for bioaccumulation. Metabolism of Radioactive Zinc Zinc-65 introduced into the Columbia River by the Hanford nuclear installa- tions was accumulated by various organisms in the adjacent North Pacific Ocean. Studies of zinc-65 specific activities in fish and prey organisms have produced estimates of intake rates of zinc-65 in the predator fish species and hypotheses 1216,1679,1680 of mechanisms of zinc-65 transport in the ocean. As mentioned, 179 image: ------- content of zinc-65 decreased markedly from 1965 to 1971 when the reactors were shut down. Specific activities decreased faster in small individuals of the flounder Lyopsetta exilis than in large individuals, indicating more thorough labeling of longer-lived pools of zinc in larger fish. Specific activity also decreased with increasing depth and with increasing body size for both Lyopsetta exilis and the rockfish Sebastolobus. From extensive time series of zinc-65 specific activities in Lyopsetta exilis 1680 and prey organisms of this species, Vanderploeg used the model = a (F(t) - S) - S X, at where j[ = zinc-65-specific activity of the predator; a = rate of zinc input as fraction of zinc body burden in the fish; J_(t) - zinc-65-specific activity of the prey; and X = physical decay constant of zinc-65. He calculated the daily rate of input of zinc as a fraction of the body burden of zinc in the fish. Values of 0.0027 day\" and 0.0026 day\" were obtained for fish of 22 g and 35 g wet weight. Zinc-65 from the Columbia River was apparently in a form more available to the Lyopsetta exilis food chain than stable zinc in seawater was to it. 1679 Vanderploeg hypothesized that several mechanisms could contribute to this conclusion. For example, some soluble zinc-65 in the river is rapidly accumulated by plankton and other small particles. A portion of the zinc-65 446 entering the ocean as suspended particulate material is desorbed and might also be sorbed to particles of marine origin. Herbivorous zooplankton feed on the particles, transform them into fecal pellets, and they, as well as settling particulate matter, deliver high specific activity zinc-65 to the 180 image: ------- continental shelf. Distribution of zinc-65 specific activity in the pelagic food web and in fauna at different depths and distances downstream from the river mouth was consistent with these hypotheses. Vanderploeg1679 found that zinc-65-specific activities in suspended particulate were greater than in the soluble form. His observation is consistent with the existence of stable unreactive complexes of zinc in seawater. Bernhard and Zattera observed that phytoplankton could accumulate zinc-65 and stable zinc differentially 1249 if they were available in different physicochemlcal forms. Piro et al. found that ionic zinc added to seawater equilibrated with the ionic and particulate zinc already present, but that the amount of complexed zinc remained unchanged. Zinc-65, when added in the form of an ethylenediaatinetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complex, however, was distributed among all forms in the same proportion as the stable element. Consequently, the presence of complexed stable zinc in the ocean would promote biologic accumulation of zinc-65 in the ionic form from organisms which selectively accumulate ionic or particulate zinc. Correlation of Zinc Turnover with Respiration Retention of zinc-65 has been proposed and used with varying degrees of success as an indirect measure of respiratory metabolism in a variety of organisms.1069*1159'1160 A very high positive correlation was demonstrated between zinc-65 turnover and oxygen consumption in young plaice, when 417 temperature was the only experimental variable. Similar observations have been obtained with mice. ' Shulman et al. found no effect of varying food intake on the turnover of zinc-65 in Menidia menidia and 181 image: ------- Fundulus heteroclitus; nor was any effect of varying dietary zinc concentration 727 on zinc-65 turnover found in Lagodon rhomboides L. For zinc-65 turnover to be a valid measure of respiration in the natural environment, both feeding rate and temperature must respond similarly and consistently to environmental changes affecting either function. Thus both feeding rate and temperature\u2014 which affect respiration\u2014must be correlated to zinc-65 excretion rate, as has been demonstrated for temperature; and respiration must be correlated with environmental zinc concentration, or the turnover of zinc by the experimental organism must be regulated independently of environmental zinc. In euphausid shrimp, respiration was poorly correlated to zinc-65 503 accumulation rates as either a function of temperature or individual dry weights. Turnover of zinc in euphausids was not metabolically controlled and was likely a surface phenomenon, suggesting a strong interdependence on both temperature and zinc concentration. Thus, the utility of zinc-65 loss as a measure of respiration under natural conditions may be restricted to vertebrates. For fishysuch a remote technique is especially desirable in natural conditions to avoid the excessive respiration produced by the stress of being confined in experimental respirometers. TOXICITY OF ZINC TO AQUATIC ORGANISMS How zinc and other heavy metals are toxic to fish has been studied since 921 the mid-1920's 39^\u00bb 1^90and the subject recently has been reviewed. Acute heavy metal toxicosis in fish has been attributed to the coagulation or precipitation of mucus on the gills and/or to cytologic damage to the gills. The physiologic mechanism of death from either cause is related to a breakdown 182 image: ------- 208 in gas exchange at the gills. Burton et al. studied acute zinc toxicosis in rainbow trout (Salmo gairdnerii) and was able to support the hypothesis that modification of the gas exchange process at the gills creates hypoxia at the tissue level. Tissue hypoxia appeared to be the major physiologic change preceding death once the gas exchange process at the gills was no longer sufficient to supply the oxygen requirements of the fish. Daphnia magna has been used as a representative of common and abundant zooplankton to study acute and chronic toxicosis produced by several metals.112 In 48-h tests for acute toxicosis, the median lethal concentration (LC ) for zinc was 100 yg/1 when no food was provided and 280 yg/1 when food was added to the water. In 3-wk studies for chronic toxicosis, reproductive impairment was found to be a more sensitive measure of toxicosis than survival. The 16% reproductive-impairment concentration was used as the criterion, as values below this level could not be detected from the controls because of variability within groups. The 16% reproductive-impairment concentration for zinc was 70 yg/1. Because the organic material added as food was found to alter the potential for toxicosis, the results may not be directly applicable for any particular water. Waller et al. evaluated data from two studies on fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) populations from three lakes. They concluded that the maximum concentration of zinc to which fish could be continuously exposed should not exceed 1/100 of the 96-h median tolerance limit (TL5Q)\u2014a concentration that caused a 50% reduction in the mean number of eggs laid per female fathead minnow in a laboratory study. The Environmental Protection Agency has suggested that bluegills be used 1529 1009 as a warm water species in bioassays. McDonald and Heimstra showed that 183 image: ------- machrochirus) are very agressive and set up dominance- submission relations when confined in aquaria. They found that dominant fish survived an exposure to 32 mg/1 zinc longer than submissive fish. A shelter placed in each compartment was found to reduce the number of agressive encounters between fish and reduced the response difference. The results indicate that dominance-submission relations may be a variable for the outcomes of bioassays with fish. 216 Cairns et al. studied the effects of pH, solubility, and temperature on the ability to produce acute zinc toxicosis in the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis machrochirus). Bluegill sunfish were for 96 h to water-soluble zinc sulfate and water-insoluble zinc phosphate at two tem- perature ranges (21-24 C and 7-9 C) and two pH ranges (5.7-7.0 and 7.3-8.8). Control fish were maintained in water containing no zinc. No bluegills died in water containing particulate zinc in amounts comparable to the amounts of soluble zinc (13.5, 18.0, 24.0, and 32.0 mg zinc, which produced mortalities of 90-100%. Bluegill mortalities in concentrations of soluble zinc ranging from 10-32 pg zinc/1 were zero to 10% at the high pH, whereas at the low pH, where ionic zinc would more readily dissociate from the zinc sulfate, mortality was 100%. Bluegills acclimated to the low temperatures died at a much slower rate, and the time-to-death of the first fish was considerably delayed in comparison to bluegills at the warmer temperature. At the concentration of zinc tested (32 yg zinc/1), the acclimation temperature had no effect on the percentage of fish surviving at the end of the 96-h test period. The acclimation temperature did, however, affect the percent survival of the bluegills at 24 and 48 h. 184 image: ------- The toxicity of zinc to the larvae of crab (Carclnus maenas) during periods 309 up to 64 h has been examined. At a concentration of 1 ppm zinc, the median effective time for 50% mortality (ET ) was 47 h. For higher concentrations of zinc, the log of the concentration and the ET were related linearly. The level of 1 ppm of zinc is about 100 times the concentration found in natural seawater. For periods longer than 47 h, however, the LC would be cnnsiderably lower and much closer to the level of zinc found in natural seawater. Thus, elevation of zinc levels in confined water to values substantially above natural levels could have a severely deleterious effect on survival of larvae. The toxicity of several metals, including zinc, to oyster embryos in synthetic seawater at 218 25% salinity and 26 C, also has been tested. For 48-h exposures, 0.075 ppm zinc produced no mortality, and 0.5 ppm zinc produced 100% mortality; the estimated LC (48 h) was 0.31 ppm zinc. 185 image: ------- CHAPTER 7 ZINC IN HUMANS The roles of zinc in the normal physiology and biochemistry systems have been reviewed widely. * ' ' ' ' ' ' ' The purpose of this chapter is to describe major aspects of the role of zinc in humans. ZINC CONCENTRATION IN BLOOD. URINE. AND FECES Zinc is found in every human tissue and tissue fluid, although concen- trations vary in different fluids and tissues. Zinc is present in nuclear, mitochondria!^ and supernatant fractions of all cells that have been examined by ultracentrifugation. Total body zinc for a hypothetical 70 kg man may * be estimated to be 2.3 g, making it the most prevalent trace metal in tissue. Table 7-1 compares the estimated zinc concentrations of several tissues in a hypothetical 70 kg man. Clearly, the major amount of zinc in the total body resides in muscle and bone (approximately 90%), although the highest con- centrations of zinc is found in tissues from the reproductive tract. Blood For convenience, mean serum zinc concentration in humans may be con- sidered to be approximately lOOyig/dl (see Table 7-2 for the ranges involved) and is the same in healthy men and women. ' Reports that differences in 935 plasma zinc occur between mean and women have appeared, but they have not been careful^ substantiated. Deviations from the mean of 100^ug/dl may be indicative \"e Iron, which exists in higher concentration, is found primarily in blood. For a human weighing about 70 kg, the total concentrations of trace metals are estimated as follows: iron, 4.0 g; zinc, 2.3 g; manganese, 0.2 g; copper, 0.1 and all others g. 186 image: ------- TABLE 7-1 Tissue Adrenal Aorta Bladder Blood Bone Brain Gastrointestinal tract Heart Kidney Liver Lung Muscle Ovary Prostate Skin Spleen Testes Thyroid WHOLE BODY in Some Human Zinc, Ug/g wet wta 6 26 22 1 66 13 21 27 48 27 14 48 12 87 6 19 13 25 33 Tissues Zinc, mg/organ 0.9 2.6 4.4 6.0 660-0 18.0 25.2 8.7 1-9.8 40.5 16.6 1,420.0 0.3 1.7 30.0 3.8 0.8 0.4 -- Zinc, % of total body (70 kg man) \u2014 0.1 0.2 0.3 28.5 0.8 1.1 0.4 0.9 1.8 0.7 62.2 \u2014 0.7 1.0 0.2 \u2014 \u2014 __ TOTAL 2,259.7 Measurements 187 image: ------- of disease or environmental conditions, and such changes will be discussed in Chapters 8, 10, and 11. Estimates of zinc in the serum, plasma, and other fluids of normal adults are set forth in Table 7-2. Measurements of serum zinc are influenced by many factors. Different techniques of measurement may produce varying results. Sample contamination (a major problem, particularly if glass syringes or collection tubes or rubber or cork stoppers are employed), hemolysis, and the addition of various agents to the sample tend to make values higher. Serum zinc is about 16% higher than 205 plasma zinc, the higher percentage reflecting differences in zinc liberated from platelets204,482 as weii as differences in volume, hemolysis and other AQO unidentified factors. Circadian variation also affects blood zinc levels: 693 932 values in the afternoon are higher than in the early morning. ' Zinc levels in serum for 2-3 h following ingestion of food have been found to be lower than those measured during the fasting state. ' Zinc is also an important constituent of red blood cells, representing approximately 10 times the amount of zinc found in serum. Erythroblasts mea- sured by histochemical techniques do not appear to contain zinc, suggesting that 1588 carbonic anhydrase may be found only in erythrocytes. Systematic chemical analyses have not yet been performed. Zinc also is present in young and mature 1588 377 reticulum cells. Leukocytes contain more zinc than erythrocytes. Granu- locytes, particularly eosinophils and basophils, are relatively rich in zinc q (14.2 yg zinc/10 cells). Zinc has been incorporated into metamyelocytes, and 1588 the content of the metal increases as granulocytes mature. The content of zinc in peripheral blood granulocytes was found to be about 30% higher than in 1588 bone marrow granulocytes. Most zinc in leukocytes is protein-bound and can 1660 be isolated in a purified form. The function of zinc in leukocytes has not been systematically investigated; however, leukocytes contain the zinc- dependent enzymes alkaline phosphatase and peptidase, indicating that some zinc 1588,1660 in leukocytes may be associated with the activities of these enzymes. 188 image: ------- TABLE 7-2 Authors and Henkin1031 Number of persons 19 37 men 45 women 39 6 97 14 64 23 30 men 30 women 96 men 97 women 7 25 11 82 45 women 37 men Mean value \u00b1 SD Serum or plasma, 102 \u00b1 13 157 159 98 \u00b1 5 85 \u00b1 7 84 \u00b1 30 104 + 14 91 \u00b1 17 90 \u00b1 10 95 \u00b1 13 96 \u00b1 10 96 \u00b1 13 94 \u00b1 29 110 \u00b1 21 85 \u00b1 15 92 \u00b1 18 90 \u00b1 20 94 Mean value \u00b1 SD Range Dennes et al.\"' Brune et al. *-\u00b0*- 58 Auerbach Kleinman jet al. 852 Whole blood, yg zinc/ 100 ml 28 7 30 15 560 \u00b1 680 \u00b1 734 \u00b1 545 \u00b1 20 8 186 408-1170 Talbot and Ross 1592 Dennes et al. 1651 Auerbach 58 Rosner and Gorfien 1369 Red blood cells 30 15 57 30 23 11.8 \u00b1 1.8yg/g blood 8-14.9 510 14 \u00b1 1.9 yg zinc/10-9 cells 5 yg/g dry weight Szmigielski and Litwinl588 Units Granulocytes 10 bone marrow metamyelocytes juvenile cell polymorphonuclear cell peripheral blood 94 \u00b1 8.21 112 \u00b1 7 139 \u00b1 14 178 \u00b1 12 190 image: TABLE 7-2 Authors Number persons 1667 t al.

This amount contrasts with circulating copper in the blood, which represents more than 6% of total body copper but is consistent with the relative percentage of circulating hematic manganese. Concentrations of zinc in blood plasma vary considerably during the first /1QO fld0 two years of life, as shown in Figure 7-1. At birth, plasma zinc levels approximate those of normal adults, but within the first few days to a week of life, zinc levels decrease to less than one half of the means shown by C0O normal adults. \u00b0^ Zinc concentrations in infant plasma appear to remain at lower than adult levels for the first five or six months of life; then values rise again to the normal adult range, albeit at its lower end. An abrupt fall in serum zinc levels occurring at about one year of age was observed in f O O one group of normal infants. Before 15 months of age, human plasma zinc values remain normal except when influenced by physiologic or pathophysiologic processes, Such changes may be characteristic only of some infants; although clearcut patterns of change have been observed in American infants, few fluctuations have been measured in Western European babies. In adult life, the circadian variation found in plasma or serum zinc is significant.204'6603'693'932'17153 It is generally agreed that zinc levels in serum are at a minimum at 6 a.m., with the maximum occurring at 10 p.m. After 10 p.m. \u00bb. values drop rapidly and consistently. They rise rapidly after the nadir at GOO 6 a.m., and remain relatively stable over the next 8 h. J The pattern of circadian variation is somewhat similar to the circadian pattern observed in \\ the secretion of adrenal corticosteroids, although the specific timing of the nadir and zenith is displaced by approximately 4-5 h. 192 image: ------- i Plasma Zinc T (MiiSEM) 0246 Days 6 9 12 Months TIME 18 21 FIGURE 7-1 Total plasma zinc concentrations during the first two years of life..

Reproduced from Henkin et al. 193 image: 668 194 image: ------- Zinc in serum is always bound to some ligand, as illustrated in figure 7-2. Approximately 43% of the zinc circulating in blood serum is bound to al- . . 537,1205,1692,1802 bumin, presumably to one of the histidine CQf. moieties of this molecule. However, it has been suggested that zinc binds to the free carboxyl and not to the imidazoles of the histidine residues of albumin.1226 It is chemically possible for each of the 16 histidine moieties of albumin to bind one zinc molecule,-^ but albumin in human serum is normally undersaturated in zinc.^37 The zinc-albumin complex has an association constant of approximately 10\u00b0 and has been called the major macromolecular zinc ligand.537'-668 This albumin-bound zinc is in equilibrium with amino acid zinc complexes that comprise about 1-2% of the circulating zinc. * This latter group of ligands, called micromolecular zinc ligands, are almost exclusively some form of the amino acids histidine and cysteine. ' These amino acid^zinc ligands are available for transport to all tissues, including body organs, red blood cells, and brain. Histidine and cysteine easily cross the blood-brain barrier. 537,668 Porphyrin-bound zinc may serve as another micromolecular zinc ligand, although it may not be of particular quantitative importance in normal humans. Small concentrations of zinc-porphyrin complexes have been measured in normal subjects and larger concentrations are present in patients with various types of porphyria. Approximately one-third of the zinc carried in blood serum is bound to an a2-macroglobulin.^6\u00bbD68\u00bb 1205,1226 This macromolecular zinc ligand, a zinc- protein complex with an association constant greater than 10 , is not in equilibrium with the albumin-zinc complex or the amino acid zinc complexes.537,668 Zinc is incorporated into this o^-macroglobulin only in the liver and the com- plex is metabolized only there. Zinc in serum may be divided functionally into diffusible or nondiffusible fractions. Diffusible serum zinc is composed of the amino acid-bound zinc and 195 image: ------- 682 the freely exchangeable or more readily removable zinc from albumin. 682 This zinc has been quantitatively determined by ultrafiltration. The nondiffu- sible zinc has been distinguished by ultraf iltration to represent ligands with a molecular weight greater than 50,000. These distinctions have clinical value in the analysis of abnormal zinc metabolism, as noted in Chapter 10. The distribution of zinc in human serum has also been studied by measuring the partitioning of zinc between the two major macromolecular zinc COT ligands in serum. J/ As mentioned, albumin-bound zinc is both the major and the more dynamic of the two. However, it is possible to measure the a^-macroglobulin component of human serum,1^20a thereby obtaining an estimate of its relative importance. Whereas concentrations of albumin-bound zinc and total serum zinc were highly correlated (p<.01) as were the concentrations of albumin and albumin-bound zinc, c^-macroglobulin-bound zinc was not significantly correlated with either total serum zinc or with the serum concentration of c^-macroglobulin. Urine Approximately 500 yg/24 h appears in the urine of healthy -subjects. This zinc content reflects changes in nutrition, physiology disease, and the environment. In normal subjects, urinary zinc is composed of zinc pri- marily bound to amino acids and secondarily to porphyrins. Zinc in urine apparently is not correlated with any of the known variables that determine the behavior of serum zinc. Whereas there is a clear circadian variation in serum zinc, none has been observed in urinary zinc excretion.^ This inability to pinpoint a circadian variation in urinary zinc contrasts with the discovery of a circadian variation in serum and urine copper^2 an^ may indicate some basic differences in the manner by which the metals are handled by 196 image: ------- the kidney. The unhindered passage of zinc-amino acid complexes in normal blood across the renal glomerulus would result in a calculated filtered load of 2 mg of zinc in a normal 24-h glomerular filtrate of 18351. Thus, the major part of the normal filtered load of amino acid-complexed zinc (and presumably, porphyrin-complexed zinc) must be reabsorbed by the kidney, al- though the exact nature and characteristics of the reabsorption have not been well studied. Feces Zinc in feces represents the major source of zinc lost from the body. The zinc content of feces varies with the zinc content of the diet, and, as such, varies from 5-10 mg daily, and roughly 70-80% of ingested zinc is found in the stool. Zinc in feces also is composed of zinc secreted from the gastrointestinal tract and the bile. Although reabsorption has not been well studied in man, estimates from the rat suggest that zinc is secreted 362b into the gut lumen and that one-third of this zinc normally is reabsorbed. Zinc in meconium of normal babies varies from 39-569 Vg/g dry weight, with a mean of 230 iig/g dry weight. The amount of zinc in meconium was found to be approxi- mately three times the amount of iron or copper and 10 times the amount of Q/r \u00aby manganese. Infants with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, meconium ileus, and intestinal obstruction were reported to exhibit lower mean levels of zinc O / T/\u00bb in meconium than did normals. Other Body Fluids and Tissues Zinc in sweat is about 115 pg/100 ml. Under conditions of extreme heat, zinc losses through this route have been reported to increase to as much as 97 ntA 309a,720a,1288,1585a,1816b 1355 U7A 2-3 mg/day. These and other 1JD-5\u00bb-L^/^ data indicate that the zinc content of sweat can be greater than that of serum. 197 image: ------- Zinc concentration in human milk was found to be higher than that of any other trace element. 1101'16/t\u00b0 The level of zinc in human milk varies with time after delivery. In colostrum the zinc level was found to be 3-5 times the level in milk found 1 wk after parturition, after which 675 996 the level fell slowly over the next 6 months. ' It is evident that zinc levels in human milk are carefully controlled, and maternal levels of prolactin have been suggested as an important factor in such control. An average zinc level in human milk 4-6 mo after parturition is 50 yug/100 ml. In milk from cows delivered to market in the U.S., zinc content varied from 1.3-12.4 ug/100 ml with an average of 4.4 ug/100 ml. ' ' As would be expected, cows' milk stored in galvanized cans was higher in zinc, varying from 55-154 ^ig/100 ml. \" Zinc content of cows' milk is re- portedly constant all year, but it will vary somewhat with geographic 1101 other factors affecting bovine metabolism. location, diet, and / The importance of the zinc content of milk as an essential nutrient is suggested by a report of zinc deficiency in newborn / 1 O mice nourished by a mother lactating for a fairly long time after parturition. Small amounts of zinc also appear in. the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) . Zinc has been found in various secretions of the gastrointestinal tract, in- secretions. Zinc is also an important constituent of cerumen. Its concentration is over 1,800 yg/g, roughly 300 yg/g greater than the amount of calcium found, 50 times greater than the concentration of 151 copper, and 5 times greater than the concentration of magnesium. 198 image: ------- Zinc has been found in sebum excreted from skin.208*'374'1557 By measuring excretion rates 344b,1558a tne amount of sebum may be z\u00b1nc content male weanling rats made zinc- deficient, sebaceous gland hypertrophy was observed despite depressed pituitary and testicular function. From these observations, hypotheses were advanced that disorders of sebum production such as acne might be related to disorders of zinc metabolism. ' Patients with acne treated with oral zinc sulfate were said to show decreased sebum production and remission of acne. ' 208a These findings have not been reproduced. In 1940, Eggleton estimated the zinc and copper content of tissues of Chinese subjects by a colorometric technique. Using emission spectroscopy, Tipton and Cook estimated the concentration of 24 trace elements, including zinc, in normal human tissues from 150 adults who died quickly as a result of a,n accident (Table 7-3) . Many of these values subsequently were confirmed by atomic 1451 absorption spectrophotometry. Although limited sampling made direct comparisons difficult, zinc in tissues of Mideastern and Chinese subjects was higher than in 1621 their counterparts in the United States and Africa. Forssen carried out similar studies in Finnish and British people who died accidentally or by violence. ^ His results, which are set forth in Table 7-4, are generally similar to Tipton and Cook's, whose findings in American subjects are provided in Table 7-3. No differences in zinc concentrations were observed between men or women and little difference was noted with age, except that zinc levels in the ovary appeared to decrease with age in healthy . British women. Zinc in prostate is also known to increase with age, usually in association with prostatic hyper trophy. 1451 Highest concentrations of zinc were found in human prostate and hair, followed by muscle and liver, and kidney and pancreas; the rest of the metal was distributed 199 image: ------- TABLE 7-3 Concentrations of Zinc in Normal Tissue of Adult Americans a Organ, or Tissue Adrenal Aorta Brain Diaphragm Esophagus Heart Intestine, duodenum Kidney Larynx Liver Lung Muscle Ovary Pancreas Prostate Spleen Skin Stomach Testis Thyroid Urinary bladder Uterus Number of Samples 15 104 129 91 67 140 68 145 48 150 141 137 16 138 50 142 21 130 71 21 112 32 jjg Zinc/g Tissue Median 1600 1800 760 4600 2600 2700 2400 4500 1200 3500 1300 4300 1700 2300 7500 L300 780 2400 7-4 Concentrations of Zinc in Normal Tissue of Adults in Brain Parietal lobe Pancreas Gall Urinary System Kidney Bladder Reproductive System Testes Prostate Ovary Uterus Vagina Breast Endocrine System Adrenal Thyroid Lymphomyeloid Tissue Spleen Lymph nodes Thymus Bone marrow Musculoske.letal System Skeletal muscle Articular cartilage (knee) Costal cartilage Bone (rib) Integument and Fat Skin (midventral) Fat (under midventral skin) Hair Number of ..

Discrepancies among zinc values in different studies differ primarily in the zinc content of muscle, which varies considerably. Differences in measurements of zinc content of the same tissues and organs commonly occur, and result in part from the diversity of methods used (emission spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, X-ray fluorescence, etc.) to analyze these tissues. Results have been expressed as jig zinc/g tissue ash, ug zinc/g dry wt,^ug zinc/g wet wt, and ug/zinc/g nitrogen. Because soft tissue loses water easily during sample preparation, results calculated on a wet weight basis must be evaluated carefully. Losses and contamination during preparation for analysis can also make it difficult to specify the zinc level in a given tissue with certainty. In addition, the source of the human tissues analyzed is factors dependent upon such diverse / as age, sex, physical and clinical well being at the time of demise, drugs used, and etiology and timing of death.

' ' * ' It is of interest that the ventral prostate of rat contains little zinc compared to the posterior portion. * These proportions may relate to histologic and physiologic differences observed between these areas. although The function of prostatic zinc is unknown, /it may supply zinc to spermatozoa.

Later studies indicated that zinc could be partitioned between high and low molecular weight ligands, although a specific protein could not be identified . Studies of boar semen have been repeated in the dog; the zinc in epididymal 1 OQO sperm was loosely bound in both cases. However, zinc in rat sperm is less 1393 available for ethylenediaminetetraacetic aci4 (EDTA) extraction. In women, adding zinc to the cervipal mucus in the uterus inhibits sperm penetration although copper is a more effective contraceptive agent. Zinc levels in endometrium are lowest in the late proliferative phase (days 10-12 of the menstrual cycle); they gradually increase thereafter, reaching 205 image: ------- SQfi SQ7 their highest levels during the late secretory phase (days 25-27). ' The zinc concentration of cervical mucus of normal menstruating females has also been studied. In menstruating women, zinc in dry cervical mucus varied between 14 and 939 yg/g.866b The highest zinc values were found before or just after ovulation (794-939 wg/g dry mucus). A cyclic pattern of zinc concentration was noted in women, 66a,871a an(j an observable midcycle peak was measured in the monkey. a Sharp peaks in zinc in cervical mucus unrelated to menses were thought to come from intercourse, since an average ejaculate contains about 14 mg zinc/100 dl, or about 8-10 times as much zinc as does cervical mucus. Kidney Few data are available on the levels of zinc in kidney other than those reported in studies on tissues in general. In rat kidney, zinc in the cortex was found to be five times higher than in the medulla, 1^83 with the highest concentrations occurring in cytoplasm of the cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, 1482a ^& ciliary edge of the proximal part of the nephron, the ascending part of Henle's loop, and the cytoplasm of the cells in the distal part of the nephron. After unilateral nephrectomy, zinc rises over the first few postoperative days, but after the compensatory hypertrophy occurs the level reverts to normal. ^' In rats with alloxan diabetes, renal zinc concentration decreased markedly, 1482a ^eTea8 z\u00b1nc levels were observed to return toward normal after insulin administration. A correlation between zinc content and alkaline phosphatase activity was reported for the renal tubules. Sensory Systems The concentration of zinc in the human eye is high, although not as 964 high as in the prostate. Human eye tissues may not be as richly endowed with zinc as are some animal eye tissues.1751'1753'1754 The presence of zinc 206 image: ------- in the eye suggests some- physiologic role for this metal in the eye or in 1752 the visual process. Indeed, studies with metas table zinc-69 suggest that zinc may be important in uveal and retinal metabolism,1177 and zinc in the human eye may be related to carbonic 'anhydrase or retinal reductase activity.886 The lens is rich in carbonic anhydrase,66 which may account for the high level of zinc in this tissue. Rats treated with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea developed retinal atrophy and cataracts associated with increases in 877 zinc content of the eye. A zinc-containing protein has been isolated from 332 the tapetum lucidum of the cat, and the zinc concentration is among the highest found in cat tissues. Zinc has been found in various fluids of the eye, further implicating this metal in some aspect of the visual process. Zinc has also been found in or near the taste bud681 and in saliva. Its absence from the saliva is associated with loss of taste acuity and the appearance of pathologic changes in taste buds. Zinc in saliva has been with found in gustin, a metalloprotein that may be involved /providing nutrition to the taste buds. In addition, zinc in saliva has been claimed to reflect zinc 678 nutrition in the body. Because this fluid is easily obtainable, its measure- ment may be useful in determining some aspects of zinc status in the body. Brain Zinc is uniformly present in the human brain. It is the fourth most prevalent element in the brain, preceded only by sodium, potassium, and 333a, 344, 393, 1424 magnesium. Twice as much zinc is present in the brain as copper. The gray matter of human brain tissue contains about twice the amount of zinc AQl found in the white matter. In 21 brain samples, gray and white matter had 257 78 and 33.7 yg zinc/g dry weight respectively. Recently, brain regions in experimental animals627*11^3 and humans *1>738 were analyzed for zinc content; zinc was found primarily in the hippocampus, hypothalamus , and mossy fibers 207 image: ------- of the cerebellum. Zinc in the cortex was greater than that in the medulla. ^ Loss of zinc from the brain has btten associated with several neurologic symptoms. Zinc has been found in the basal ganglia \" as well as in various pituitary fractions. \u00b0 Radioactive zinc accumulates in high concentration in steer , , 456 pituitary. Heart In isolated heart mitochondria zinc alone or with -chloromercuribenzene sulfonate increased the accumulation of magnesium; it was suggested that zinc T67 altered the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. Zinc also initiated a vigorous uptake of potassium. Addition of zinc under carefully defined experi- mental conditions was sufficient to induce the transport of potassium by heart ....... 163,164 mit ochondr ia . Lung Little is known about the concentration of zinc in the lung. Few functional studies have been performed concerning changes in zinc levels during physiologic or pathologic changes in pulmonary parenchyma. One report notes that during the acute phase of tuberculosis, zinc levels in lung decrease. (In patients with chronic forms of the disease, zinc levels increase in lung parenchyma. ) Zinc also accumulates in the damaged pleura of patients with acute tuberculosis. Pancreas Zinc is found mainly in the islets of Langerhans in the cytoplasm of the a-and 0-cells. In other parts of the pancreas, the concentration of zinc is very low. Small doses of alloxan have been shown to increase the zinc content in the pancreas, whereas high doses made zinc disappear from the 3-cells; in Thus the a-cells zinc content increased. /zinc may pl&y a role in the function of 208 image: ------- cells that elaborate insulin and secrete glucagon.1482 Although insulin is biologically active when zinc is absent, the metal has been shown to prolong the physiologic action of insulin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) preparations, apparently by retarding their rate of absorption.1274 The relationships between zinc and insulin, and glucagon are thought to be similar. The role of zinc in ACTH action has not been clearly characterized. Liver Very few studies of zinc content in liver of normal humans have been carried out except those in which zinc levels in several tissues were studied. Zinc levels in liver have been studied most often in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, in which condition zinc levels are consistently lower than in normal 149a,1680a,1680b subjects. From studies of viral hepatitis, it has been found that the production of macromolecular zinc ligands synthesized in the liver is 683 reduced, and the concentration of amino acids found in blood is increased. This shift in equilibrium allows zinc bound to micromolecular ligands to increase, 683,1420a with subsequent hyperzincuria and total body zinc loss. Zinc also has been studied in the liver of patients with various types of carcinomas.8^3* Mean normal adult values of liver zinc are 279 yg/g dry weight; zinc levels in patients with cancer ranged from 147-421 yg/g dry weight. The meaning of such a wide range is unclear, although Addink has suggested some relation between high levels of hematic and hepatic zinc. Olson et al. reported low levels of zinc in patients with hepatic tumors. Zinc in i normal liver was calculated to be 38 yg/g wet weight, zinc in the uninvolved portion of carcinomatous liver was 80 yg/g wet weight, and the liver tumors contained 18 yg/g wet weight. 209 image: ------- Muscle^ The concentration of zinc in muscle represents the largest zinc pool in man. Zinc levels reported in muscle have been quite variable. ' * 1451,1620,1621 Only a small fraction of the total zinc in muscle is free. The role of zinc in muscle contraction has been investigated but its action is unclear. Zinc binding to glycerol-extracted muscle exerts a strong relaxing effect, probably through interaction with sulfhydryl groups. In small con- centrations, zinc produces a marked potentiation of the muscle twitch. At higher concentrations^ zinc reversibly blocks transmission at the neuromuscular 1402a,1402b junction. The amplitude of the contraction of skeletal muscle was 785 reduced in the presence of 0.5 mM zinc and increased with 0.01 mM. The 1122 amplitude of cardiac muscle contraction was not enhanced by zinc, sug- gesting that the role of zinc is different in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Hair Analyses of zinc in hair under some conditions can correlate with the zinc level of serum. Because hair is readily available, it has been commonly used as an index of tissue zinc. However, hair represents \"history\" as its growth is reflected in its length from the hair shaft. Awareness of this phenomenon is necessary to evaluate any changes in zinc levels along the hair shaft. Zinc 1704 fluctuates greatly close to the scalp. Hair zinc varies in hair of different colors\u2014the highest amounts are in black hair and the lowest in blonde hair\u2014 723,1450 apparentiy related to the high level of zinc in hair melanosomes and melanoproteins. ' Zinc may be active in melanogenesis. Harrison et al. measured the zinc content in hair of 122 normal individuals. The mean dry weight was 178.7 ug/g, the median 171.3 ug/g, 642 and the range was 81-314 Vg/g* These values agree reasonably well with other . 411 measurements. It has been claimed that hair zinc levels reflect body zinc levels, but by themselves they are not particularly good indices. Rats fed zinc-deficient diets 1 ^27 exhibit lower than normal zinc levels in hair. Similar low levels of zinc 210 image: ------- in hair have been associated with zinc abnormalities in man,617'1557'1558 but such relationships are more firmly established in animals than in humans.855 Hair zinc levels are particularly inaccurate in reflecting zinc stores in prepubescent children. \" Lower than normal levels of hair zinc have also been found in pregnant and lactating women.620 Hair zinc varies systematically from infancy through the first four years of life615 and demonstrates changes that generally follow those of serum. At birth, hair zinc levels are similar to those found in adults, but they decrease over the next year of life. Adult levels are not attained again until four years of age. Fluctuations in hair zinc are illustrated in Figure 7-3. New methods for evaluating the composition of hair take into account the incorporation of metals into the hair matrix during mitosis. Metals also may and incorporated into the be adsorbed onto the hair surface or utilized metabolically/ structure of the hair shaft. Thus zinc concentration in the cold- and hot-water soluble and Insoluble fractions can be determined.

Bones, Tendon, Nails, and Teeth Zinc is always found in bones and represents a major body pool of Zinc.17\u00bb651\u00bb909\u00bb1399 Although the function of zinc in bone is not clear, it may aid in calcification as an organic constituent of bone or as an activator of the calcification process itself. Its ability to exchange with bone calcium 1399,1399a in vitro is well known. Even when bone is demineralized, zinc is found 91,1527 in small but constant amounts in the insoluble organic fraction of bone t o o ^ RO7 and tendon. * Thus, zinc could be bound in some manner to the collagen 1 527 matrix and not merely present in the interstitial fluids. Indeed, Hsu 729 has postulated a specific role for zinc in collagen metabolism, perhaps in the cross linking of the collagen matrix. 1437 Zinc is present in human rib cartilage. Concentrations vary with age; it is lowest under 2.5 years of age and after that it rises. Dwarfs did not show any significant differences from normal subjects. In teeth, zinc concentration is greatest in the top layer of the enamel, and it decreases in the underlying layers. The deposition of zinc in the tooth enamel probably takes place at the same time fluoride is laid down. Analyses of human enamel showed that zinc was present in all enamel samples but varied 1144 widely, ranging from 58-1,550 ppm. Pregnancy and Fertility Changes in zinc metabolism during pregnancy have been studied extensively and reviewed in other portions of this phapter. However, several 213 image: ------- investigators have attempted to assess the relationship between zinc metabolism and pregnancy by measuring changes in blood and/or hair zinc during pregnancy. Many changes noted in zinc metabolism during pregnancy are the result of the changing hormonal state, and the shifts in zinc among the various body pools 1 primarily are related /to the complex interaction between maternal, placental, and perhaps fetal secretion of several hormones. The dynamics of hormonal interactions have not been fully characterized so that many of the changes in zinc metabolism must still be described as observations determined over time* Changes in blood zinc during pregnancy have been described,613.\u00ab-6\u00bb669,676,797,1164a as have changes in hair * and blood zinc in the fetus and in the amniotic fluid.669'676 That zinc is retained during pregnancy primarily in the placenta has been hypothesized by Sandstead,1404 based upon data collected by others.767\u00bb1770a A zinc coating has been used either alone or with copper as an effective agent in the control of reproduction following the insertion.of a wire, loop, or T-bar device into the cervix in rabbits and rats.1021*1022 Although the specific role of zinc and/or copper in this process has not been characterized as a chemical event, Insertion of zinc and copper wires into the uterus of pregnant and estrous rabbits appeaxad to increase uterine motility, thereby affecting fertili- 1021 ty.

Of further interest is that following the insertion of a copper-T device into the cervix 1163a in 16 women there was a much greater increase in endometrlal zinc than copper. Changes with.

Zinc-65 has been found in /even when the only source is the male sire, ultimately from the spermatozoa in 580 which zinc-65 has equilibrated with naturally occurring zinc. Infancy and childhood. High (>200 yg/g wet tissue) concentrations of zinc 813 have been found in the liver of newborns, which persist until about the fourth month of life. Then levels fall, and the lowest values are reached at age 10; 813 after age 10, hepatic zinc increases gradually until adult values are attained. The zinc content of many brain regions of newboms was lower than that found 641 in adult brains. Zinc contents of infant organs are shown in Table 7-7. Table 7-8 lists zinc values for some body fluids of children at different zinc ages. Whole blood/levels of a newborn child are about 29% the amount found in 852 whole blood of a healthy adult. One reason for the small amount may be discovered in the lower content of zinc and carbonic anhydrase in the red blood i cells of the newborn. By the end of the first year of life, the zinc level 957 doubles, and it reaches normal adult values by the second year of life. Zinc levels in blood and hair of infants and children with several physiologic and pathologic conditions have been reviewed recently. 215 image: ------- TABLE 7-7 Concentration of Zinc in Tissues of Infants6 Organ or tissue Liver Kidney Spleen Pancreas Thymus Brain Adrenal gland Age 4 h 6 h 13 d 2 yr 2 yr 6 h 13 d 6 h. 13 d 2 yr 6 h. 6 h 6 h 6 h Sex Female Female Male Male Male Female Male Female Male Male Female Female Female Female Zinc, ^ig/g wet weight of tissue 228 105 172 80 33 28 21 15 12 24 58 16.7 7.2 10.7 1210 from Parr and Taylor. 216 image: ------- TABLE 7-8 Zinc Content of Body Fluids in Children Number of Authors 970 Mahanand and Houck Hellwege660 ' Henkin*69 682 Henkin et al. 852 Kleiman et al.

ZINC ABSORPTION Routes Zinc is absorbed across several physiologically active membranes, including the gut mucosa, alveolocapillary membrane, and tissue and organ membranes. Absorption across the gut mucosa occurs after oral administration. Absorption across the tissue and organ membranes normally follows gastrointestinal absorption or parenteral administration. Zinc most commonly enters the body through ingestion of food and drink. Inhalation of the metal and its absorption across the alveoloctp- illary membrane present a specialised type of absorption, because the amount of cine available via this route is usually small except among sine workers where metal fums fever or other forms of zinc inhalation may cause clinical problems.* Absorption across tissue and organ membranes is a natural consequence of all forms of presentation. In addition, zinc may be absorbed across the unbroken epithelial membrane of the skin as well as across the broken epithelial membrane after burns or wounds. Mechanisms Orally administered zinc is absorbed at several loci in the gastrointestinal tract. Earliest evidence of absorption appears in the stomach as soon as 15 min after ingestion. Although the major site of zinc absorption appears to be *See Chapter 11. 218 image: ------- pom o\u00bbh , 7000 6000 5000 4000 3000 2000 1000 0 II X S * -S^ Mean concentrations of zinc in the kidney in 221 subjects from the United States.

However, a consideration of the molecular characteristics of zinc would indicate that 987 the formation of a tetrahedral quadradentate ligand with a small organic molecule is the preferred absorption complex. Our knowledge of this process is limited. The initial event in absorption probably is the formation of a low molecular weight organic zinc chelate; the presence of a zinc-protein complex in the gut has been suggested by several investigators. '* The soluble organozinc complex may be passively absorbed across the plasma 1398 membrane of the mucosa of the intestinal villi following first-order kinetics. Although not established in gut mucosa, this type of kinetics has been suggested in studies of zinc uptake into fish liver slices, where metabolic inhibitors such as dinitrophenol, potassium cyanide, or iodoacetic acid did not influence transport.1328 gome workers have questioned this passive first-order kinetic process, ^28 jjut their data\u2014in which an active process is suggested\u2014are not entirely convincing in view of the informa- tion supporting the other opinion. The remainder of the ingested zinc forms an insoluble, nondiffusible complex transported and carried in the intestinal products and excreted in the feces. Fecal zinc is composed in large part of all the unabsorbed zinc. However, some absorbed zinc is also found in feces; this amount includes zinc excreted in the bile, in the pancreatic fluids found in the second portion of the duodenum, and fluids composed of back diffusion products derived from gut serosal to mucosal transport. In the rat the serosal to mucosal zinc transport can account for as much as one-third of the total zinc content of the feces. The feces of a man with an average zinc intake of 15 mg daily contains between 10-14 mg zinc. 223 image: ------- Many agents affect zinc absorption positively or negatively at the initial stage of absorption. Agents that inhibit formation of the low molecular weight organic zinc complex and thereby decrease absorption include phytate (from bread and other sources),1157'1328 and soy protein. Other agents that influence absorption (but to a lesser extent due to a smaller oral intake) are peanut, sesame,906 cottonseed, saf flower, and other meals,1141 and franklinites,416 arginine,716 calcium,365'4893 particularly 691 when phosphate in high and phosphates, particularly when calcium is high, other metals,1669 particularly cadmium,40 and food itself.3'822'1421 Oral intake of exogenous zinc even 45 min after a light meal may decrease zinc absorption.* In the rat, a lowered protein intake was associated with decreased zinc absorption, but a low protein intake has been associated with increased zinc uptake in man. Other factors also influence the manner by which zinc is transported across the intestinal mucosa. They include temperature (as temperature decreases, 1398 transport decreases), concentration of zinc in the external medium (as zinc concentration increases, absorption increases), and efflux of zinc from the tissue itself (e.g., loosely bound zinc will exchange with circulating zinc and become mobilized and metabolized) . Concentration of zinc in tissue must be taken into account because it varies inversely to the amount of absorbable zinc. Other factors include the physicochemical characteristics of 154 zinc in relationship to the state of the mucosa, dietary components not previously mentioned (for example, food additives or other substances that act on zinc such as oxidizing or reducing compounds), alcohol, and the microbial C.OQ characteristics of the gut. The age of the subject may affect absorption. ^Substances which limit zinc availability by limiting solubility of the zinc itself by complexation with the organozinc complex may be species- dependent. 224 image: ------- Adding EDTA and other synthetic chelators to food counteracts the negative effects of phytate and calcium365'691'741 to some extent,1508 and other naturally occurring complexing agents produce similar effects.1157 In states of zinc deficiency, rats and dogs exhibit impaired intestinal absorption of zinc, and it may be considered an anomalous physiologic condition. Clinical problems of gastrointestinal absorption, including malabsorptive processes of several types, will decrease metal absorption. Zinc can be lost during several disorders, such as excessive renal loss of trace metal because of intrinsic kidney disease or changes in tubular or glomerular function; defective metal binding in plasma of a congenital, acquired, or iatrogenic type; or probably through Inborn errors of metabolism, since some aminoacidemias and aminoacidurias 1495,1496 are associated with excessive loss of metals. A few agents appear to increase zinc absorption in animals by providing or aiding in the fomation of the low molecular weight organic zinc complex; these 537,904,1141 875 include histidine, cysteine, and methionine; EDTA; and several 96 zinc-sugar complexes. Vitamin C also has been reported to increase zinc absorption with the intake of food.882 Rats raised in a germ-free environment appear to utilize zinc better than rats raised in an environment with 1509 normal bacterial flora. 1345c When zinc-65 is administered orally, plasma levels peak 2-4 h later; 1368,1532,1534,1535,1537 about 50% of the total dose was found in the feces within 15 days after oral administration. The average net absorption of zinc-65 varied between 30-70%, but Spencer observed approximately 50% absorption of the isotope.1532 She also noted that low zinc-65 levels in plasma reflected low absorption, where- 1532 as higher plasma levels reflected greater absorption. Although high calcium intake decreased zinc absorption in rat, sheep, and other animals, this did 1538 not appear to be the case in humans. Dietary protein does influence zinc absorption in humans. Subjects on a low protein intake had higher zinc-65 plasma levels and lower fecal zinc-65 levels than individuals on a normal 225 image: ------- Human protein intake.1534'1535'1537 /subjects on a high protein intake exhibited the expected converse results. After intravenous administration of a single dose of zinc-65, human liver 11 ^7 has been shown to accumulate and retain zinc, perhaps because of metallothlonein 1S38 in liver. More than 2 mo after the dose, the liver contained about one-fourth the level found the first day after administration. Zinc is also found in the kidney, spleen, and intestinal mucosa, and zinc levels in lung are similar to 1532 those found in the gut. Pancreas, adrenals, and thyroid show relatively high uptake of zinc-65, whereas prostate, the organ with the highest zinc 1532 concentration, is rather low in activity. In muscle, the turnover of zinc-65 is quite slow\" the highest activity is found in cardiac muscle. Bone exhibits low uptake but prolonged retention. Bile concentration of zinc-65 also is low.1532 Differences in human blood, fecal, and tissue levels are a function of the route of administration of zinc-65. Following oral zinc-65, the isotope may be found in blood within 15-20 min with peak levels found within 2-4 h. After oral administration, plasma or serum zinc-65 levels are higher than in whole blood. Levels in red blood cells increased for the first 5 days after intravenous injection of a single dose of zinc-65 and decreased thereafter; after 28 days zinc-65 in red blood cells was 2-3 times higher than that in plasma. No matter what the route of administration of the isotope was, most of it was found in of administration. the feces^although the amount differed according to route/ Following oral administration of a single dose, 66% of the isotope was found in the feces within the first 3 days. After 21 days, 70% of the isotope was found in the feces, 2% in the urine, and 28% remained in the body. Most of the gastrointestinal absorption occurred within 4 h of oral administration. These studies were carried out in older adult males. Thus, little or no information about distribution in young adults or male-female differences is available. Zinc balance has been studied in only a few small groups of children. In 36 7-10-yr-old girls in 3 different areas in the United States, daily 226 image: ------- 437 zinc intake was found to be from 4.6-9.3 rag, with a mean of 6 mg. Protein sources in food were of animal origin in 74% of the subjects. The average fecal excretion was 3.9 mg/24 h, and urinary excretion was 274 + 69 yg/24 h. Values for fecal zinc correlated with zinc intake. In 2-yr-old children given 1707 4.34 mg zinc, 53% of the metal was retained. In 8-9-yr-old children given 1707 10.9 mg zinc, 3.8% of the metal was retained. Studies of oral absorption of zinc-65 in human subjects provide values 1345c ranging from 25-90%. Absorption values found by Richmond et_ al. for four people given zinc-65 chloride orally and calculated by the method of la,672a 672a 515a Aamodt e al. were 34.8, 47.5, 66.9, and 88.8%. Furchner and Richmond also reported an effect of stable zinc intake on absorption of zinc-65 in one 1534 human subject. Spencer e al. reported absorption of orally administered zinc-65 in five subjects. They reported values ranging from 27% to 43.9% with an average of 37.5%. The zinc-65 chloride was given as a single, daily dose of 15-25 yCi with breakfast. The values obtained by Aamodt e al. indicate a vari- ation of 19-100%. These values are not inconsistent with the values reported by Richmond et^ al. and it is probable that binding of zinc-65 to food proteins could 1534 account for the lower values reported by Spencer et al. Comparison of the 1534 1345c values from the studies of Spencer and Richmond et al. with those of la,672a with taste and smell dysfunction Aamodt e al. suggest that the patients/they studied fall into three groups\u2014a low absorption group with values between 19-37%, an intermediate absorption group with values between 60-75%, and a high absorption group with values close to 100%. Because only 11 patients were studied by Aamodt et_ al., the separation of absorption values into three groups was somewhat arbitrary, and the positive results by T-test, comparing the high, low, and middle group, only suggested that these groups were independent. 227 image: ------- The long-range component for the 11 patients observed by Aamodt et al. who received oral zinc-65 ranged from 250 to 498 days, except for one patient with a congenital loss of taste, who had very shortened half-times of 143 and 167 days after oral and intravenous administrations, respectively. The combination of low absorption and rapid loss of ingested zinc might be expected to lead to chronic zinc deficiency unless supplemented by a high zinc diet or exogenous zinc. Two patients studied following oral administration of zinc-65 were found to have an unusual retention pattern characterized by a sharp decrease in the second component of biologic retention. One patient's half-time changed from 288 to la,672a 145 days and the other from 350 days to 177 days. The period of shortened half-time corresponded with the period in which each of these patients had been receiving exogenous stable zinc (100 mg/day). These results imply a washout effect of orally administered, stable zinc. Some evidence for this type of effect 323 had been previously reported. Retention of intravenously administered zinc-65 by normal human subjects follows a two-component exponential pattern. The rapid component consists of 20% of the injected activity and is lost with a biologic half-time of 8 days. The slow component includes the remaining 80% of the activity and is lost with la 1534 a biologic half-time of 300 days. Spencer et l. reported that two pa- tients lost 25% of intravenously injected zinc-65 with an average half-time of 12.5 days and 75% of the injected activity with a half-time of 322 days. Newton 1137 and Holmes observed that following accidental inhalation of zinc-65 by a human subject, 27% of the inhaled activity was retained with a half-time of 18 1345c days and 73% was retained with a half-time of 453 days.* Richmond et al. reported that the slow biologic retention component was 418 days for oral admin- istration to four human subjects. Figure 7-8 compares retention of zinc-65 in man and other species. *In this study there was a greater uptake and retention of zinc-65 by soft tis- sues, including liver, than by bone. 228 image: ------- 1-0 O 10 20 X> 40 50 60 70 80 SO\"1' ?(\u00bb ' WO FIGURE 7-8 Retention of orally administered zinc-65 by four mammalian species.

This patient's zinc-65 retention after intravenous injection required three exponential components, reflecting a very rapid initial loss: 21.9% of the activity was lost with a biologic half-time of 1.5 days, 17.6X with la a half-time of 15.9 days, and 60.5% with a half-time of 235 days. Increased excretion of zinc-65 during penicillamine treatment has also been reported by Ekberg direct et. al 2a and it is probable that the increased removal was a /effect of D- penicillamine. Moreover, urinary excretion was substantially increased during the first 6 days of the study. The ratio of urinary to fecal excretion was 4,2:1 compared to a ratio of 0.2:1 for 4 patients, 2 with Wilson's disease and 2 het- 672a erozygous for Wilson's disease, neither or whom wore treated with D-penicillamine. A urine to feces ratio on the order of 0.25:1 UOX of daily excretion in urine) developed 1137 1534 following inhalation of zinc-65. Spencer et_al. reported variable for urinary to fecal excretion from 0.75:1 to 4:1 in 8 terminal cancer partients, with an average value of 0.49. The variations between urinary to fecal excretion ratios and the limited amount of data available make it difficult to conclude that D-penicillamine 1534 increases urinary zinc excretion independent of its effect on zinc absorption. After intravenous administration of rinc-65j activity decreased in whole blood and plasma during the first 24 h, followed by increased activity in whole blood and continued loss from plasma. Red blood cell activity increases during the first 5-10 days after injection and then decreases at about the same rate as the plasma thereafter. The biologic half-time is 26 days. Plasma activity initially decreases with a half-time of 3.8 min and more than 95% of the activity is removed by these short half-time components. The data for whole blood of la,672a normal subjects were resolved into four exponential components. Initially, 95% of the injected activity was removed with a half-time of 6.5 min, 2.5% of the activity was lost with a half-time of 80 min, 1.5% of the activity was lost 230 image: ------- with a half-time of 2 days, and the remaining IX was lost with a half-time of about 25 days. These values are consistent with data on whole blood reported for *1277,1278 normal subjects and growth-retarded, hypogonadal Egyptian boys, and for 1488a patients with neoplastic diseases. What is striking about the disappearance of zinc-65 from plasma is the extremely rapid loss of nearly all of the activity within the first few minutes after injection. of After intravenous administration/zinc-65, most of the isotope is rapidly la,672a taken up in liver. The rapid uptake phase, completed within the first 20 min, is followed by a slower rate of uptake continuing for 5 h, with maximum activity found between 5 and 24 h. Zinc-65 activity in liver then decreased slowly over the next 100 days. Activity measured over the thigh decreased initially, prob- ably reflecting lost activity in the blood; it then increased during the first 40-50 days after injection as the activity in the liver decreased. The apparent uptake of zinc by the thigh area following release from the liver may imply a and/or biochemical conversion / release of the injected zinc to a form stored by muscle or bone. Although many studies of zinc absorption have been reported, a great deal about the dynamics of zinc absorption 504, of uncertainty/still exists. Zinc is still considered to be absorbed poorly 614,1652 92 and variably. i % Data from several zinc-65 absorption studies lead to the following conclusions: 1. Retention (R) of intravenously injected zinc-65 bound to plasma follows a two-exponential component pattern in normal subjects; average retention was: -(0.693/6.36)t -(0.693/266.5)t R - 16.2 e +83.8 e *See Chapter 10. 231 image: ------- 2. The cystinurln patient treated with D-penicillamine had a markedly dif- ferent pattern, characterised by three exponential elements: -(0.693/235)t R - 21.9 e +17.6 e +60.5 e The major effect of D-penicillamine was rapid removal of 22% of the injected activity with a half-time of 1.5 daye. Th* similarity of the remaining retention pattern to those reported by other investigators and by studies of normal volunteers suggest that the effect of the drug was to remove zinc-65 that otherwise would have been part of the long com- ponent of retention. 1*. 3. Following Injection of zinc-65, activity in whole blood of all subjects 515a,672a,1345c,1534 decreased rapidly during the first 24 h, then In- creased to a maximum value between 5 and 10 days after injection, after which it decreased. Activity in plasma quickly decreased to less than 2% one day after injection and then more slowly for the rest of the study period. Red blood cell activity increased for the first 5-10 days after injection, then decreased at a rate similar to that of the plasma there- given D-panlcillamine after. Although the patient with cystinuria/always had less activity in cells and plasma than the normal volunteers, no significant dif- ferences were observed. 4. Measurements made over the liver area after intravenous zinc administra- in tion/patients with taste and smell dysfunction showed a pattern of rapid uptake by the liver, followed by a much slower loss. Maximum liver uptake reached 55-70X of the injected activity between 5 and 24 h after injec- tion.

Zinc Binding in Humana Zinc complexes of low molecular weight found in serum are thought to be transferred paaaivaly across tissue membranes and bound at various concentrations in different tissues, according to the concentration of tiasue-binding cine pro- teins at specific sites in tha tissues. Although metallothionein represents an 807,1304 806 important binding protein in kidney and liver, other specific tissue- binding proteins may be present.

Because zinc is an integral component of DNA polymerase, any rapidly dividing cellular system has an important requirement for zinc. However, several systems requiring zinc metalloenzymes or metalloproteins have a requirement for zinc. In addition, some systems are influenced by the presence of zinc in a manner not readily apparent from their molecular characteristics. This section will attempt to outline the role of zinc in each major system and specify how zinc acts in it. Zinc directly affects the activities of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Yet in terms of nutritive factors, carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins can affect zinc concentration and thereby change organ function and behavior. Although the role of zinc as a cof actor in enzymes has been well studied,* that zinc is an activator or transducer at cell membranes in intercellular or intracellular systems 285 only recently been suggested. Indeed, systematic studies of zinc effects thwarted until reliable techniques were developed in which concentrations of easily zinc present in the system under study could be/ measured and used to assist in the investigation of metabolic function. The discovery of zinc as a membrane stabilizer, a participant in electron transfer processes, and a major participant in enzyme- substrate interactions, all indicate the important role zinc plays in several 285 physiologic systems. The Endocrine System There are many zinc-hormone interactions in which zinc influences hormonal activity at several levels of action, including synthesis, secretion, target- organ binding, and function. Similarly, there are hormone-zinc interactions in which hormones influence the absorption, distribution, and excretion of zinc, its trans- port in blood, and its action at several levels of organization. *See Chapter 9. 234 image: ------- Zinc-hormone interactions. Zinc has been shown to influence the endocrine system at each of its major levels. Thus, increasing or decreasing the concen- tration of zinc has been shown to influence hormonal secretion in the hypothalamic- pituitary axis, the anterior pituitary-target gland axis, hormonal synthesis within target glands, and activities at several peripheral organs and target tis- sues, including hormone binding and utilization. A surfeit or deficiency of zinc has been shown to influence the endocrine system. Excess zinc will affect the endocrine system, but much less than will 1403a,1816c 9?2b 575b 518a,1206a 888a lead, mercury, iron, cadmium, nickel, and 257a,790a copper. It is more common to find that zinc deficiency affects the endocrine system adversely. It is noteworthy that zinc may influence the same or different hormonal systems independently of the mechanism of how the deficiency was produced; that is, from reduced dietary intake or greater body loss. * Other factors may influence dietary intake of zinc. For example, zinc deficiencies in animals and humans have been reported to be associated 382a,1174,1277,1640,1642 with hypogonadism. This condition has been linked with decreased testicular weight and size, decreased number of spermatozoa, and a late-stage spermatogenic arrest, yet Leydig cells have remained intact. In rats are depressed in 575b with severe zinc deficiency, growth and development / the testes, epididymis, 423a,488a,1044b accessory sex organs and pituitary. It has been reported that 1044b complete testicular atrophy induced in zinc-depleted rats is irreversible, whereas in other studies gonadotropin administration was associated with gonadal maturation. Zinc supplements have been reported to reverse the signs of the deficiency in all organs, but neither the testes nor the epididymis regain 1044b their normal size, function or zinc concentration. Similar effects have been *Zinc-deficient diets and their effects are discussed in Chapter 8. 235 image: ------- 1054a 1053 reported for cattle and goats. However, there was little or no differ- ence in the synthesis of testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone following the in- cubation of testicular tissue with hydrogen-3 cholesterol from zinc-deficient or 1272a pair-fed control rats. These latter findings indicate that the mechanisms involved in this process are not in the testis itself. These results are consistent with those investigators who suggested that the effects of zinc deficiency on the release of pituitary gonadotropins are the major phsiologic factors influencing the 1044c changes observed. Indeed, lower levels of plasma and pituitary luteotrophic hormone (LH) were found in zinc-deficient rats than in controls although levels of 544 hypothalamic LHRH were similar. Responsiveness to exogenously administered LH and FSH was greater in zinc~deficient than in restricted-fed control rats although a comparison of pituitary or plasma LH or FSH levels between these two groups of rats was not reported. The influence of zinc on pituitary function has been studied for many years. In 1939, /zinc was shown to enhance pituitary activity when a crude extract from the posterior pituitary was injected into frogs and the water-retentive property of 150 the extract was prolonged by adding zinc salts. The action of what might presently be considered to be the pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) was enhanced after zinc salts were added to anterior pituitary extracts and then injected into sexually immature or hypophysectiomized 116,117,997a rats. More recently, incubating zinc with bovine pituitary extracts has been associated with increases in circulating growth hormone (GH), thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH), LH, FSH, and ACTH, although the amounts of zinc re- quired to produce these effects were larger than would be necessary for copper or 888b nickel to produce them. 236 image: ------- The specific role of zinc in insulin action has not been clearly defined. When present in the insulin molecule, it is well known that it delays its phsio- 1459 logic action and prolongs hypoglycemic activity. Although native insulin does not contain zinc and zinc-free insulin is fully potent, the metal has been 1459 useful in the crystallization of the insulin molecule. Hormone-zinc interactions. Just as zinc influences the endocrine system, changes in the concentrations of various hormones affect the concentrations of several trace metals in blood, urine, and other tissues. Thus, increasing or decreasing the concentration of trophic pituitary hormones has been associated with fluctuations in body concentrations of zinc as well as changes in the secre- tion of hormones from target glands. Differences in the hormonal secretion of several target glands also have been associated with changes in zinc concentration. Whether or not releasing hormones in the hypothalamus influence trace metal concentrations is not yet known. Changing levels of circulating hormones may alter the distribution of zinc in various cellular compartments, promote alterations in zinc-ligand interactions, or alter renal or hepatic handling of trace metals. These changes generally accompany changes in the body concentration of zinc either because they produce a shift to tissue compartments not normally associated with such zinc concentra- tions or they may increase urinary and fecal loss, thereby bringing about total body loss. Effects of growth, hormone. Increased concentrations of circulating growth hormone, which occur in patients with untreated acromegaly, have been associated 237 image: ------- 667 with reduced serum zinc and greater urinary zinc excretion. Treating these patients with surgical hypophysectomy or X-irradiation, procedures which lower circulating growth hormone levels, also decreases urinary zinc excretion, in- creases serum zinc concentration, and slightly decreases serum copper concentra- 667 tion. Conversely, decreased concentration of circulating growth hormone, which occuis in patients with untreated, isolated growth hormone deficiencies, has been associated with elevated levels of serum zinc and decreased excretion of urinary 667 zinc. Treating these patients with exogenous growth hormone lowered the elevated serum zinc level and elevated the previously reduced urinary zinc excretion, To demonstrate these interrelationships further, changes in trace metal metabolism were studied following the intravenous administration of arginine hydrochloride to patients of short stature to evaluate growth hormone release. ' In one subject with low plasma levels of growth hormone, serum zinc concentration was elevated and excretion of urinary zinc was depressed. Following arginine administration, growth hormone concentration in blood increased, whereas serum zinc levels fell; urinary zinc excretion increased in temporal relationship with the rise of growth hormone in plasma. These results suggest that growth hormone levels in blood are directly related to urine levels of zinc excretion. These changes may be related to the manner by which growth hormone either directly and/or indirectly affects the binding of zinc to its macromolecular and micromolecular ligands in blood, thereby 537,668 affecting the urinary excretion of zinc. However, the specific relation- ships between total serum zinc concentration and plasma growth hormone levels are there was not entirely clear, because/no significant correlation between these two variables were ggy when the data obtained / plotted. The lack of significance may indicate that 668 blood growth hormone levels do not influence macromolecular liganded zinc as 238 image: ------- 668 much as zinc bound to albumin or peptides. Therefore, total serum zinc may only reflect some of the physiologic and biochemical changes that occur in hormonal disorders. Effects of progesterone. Little or no change in serum or urinary zinc occurs after rats receive small amounts of progesterone. However, serum zinc concentra- tions decrease following administration of large amounts of progesterone to 1415 rats. In women receiving various drugs to control fertility, serum zinc con- 613 centrations may be lowered, whereas serum copper concentrations are elevated. The mechanisms by which these changes occur have not been well studied. Effects of other gonadal hormones. In adult rats with gonads removed, serum 1415 zinc concentrations are uniformly low. They increase with the administration gonadal of the appropriate male or female/hormones. The pattern of change in serum zinc 599, has been well studied in women and rats during their menstrual or estrus cycle, 1203,1415 599,676,797,839,1203,1548 1415 pregnancy, and during pseudopregnancy in rat. Each condition demonstrated an inverse relationship between estrogen and progesterone and serum zinc concentration. In these studies little influence of pituitary 415 gonadotropin on zinc metabolism in gonadectomized rats was observed, although the influence of pituitary hormones on male hypogonadism in rats is well known. Zinc, as noted, is present in the placenta of pregnant womenjand levels change during pregnancy. In one study, at term, the zinc content of the placenta was high, representing 1-2% of the total zinc content of the pregnant 1548 480 female. In another report, the zinc content of the placenta was highest 6-12 wk into the pregnancy and it decreased thereafter. The role of zinc in the placenta is really not known. However, it may be related to its high level of 707 253 alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme that increases in serum as pregnancy proceeds. 239 . image: ------- Changes in serum zinc have been studied during the menstrual cycle of normal females with contradictory results. However, there was one indication that serum zinc concentrations did exhibit changes during the menstrual cycle, with the 599 highest level coinciding with the time of ovulation. Whether any specific relationship between ovulation and zinc metabolism exists is still unanswered. In humans, the influence of gonadal steroids and their analogues has been most clearly demonstrated in the effects of these agents on lowered serum zinc 611,613,1415 levels. No specific contraceptive effect was imputed to the changes in serum zinc levels, but the possible importance of their coexistence should be noted. The exact role of zinc in testicular function is not known. In rats fed 80 zinc-deficient diets, testicular atrophy eventually developed. In zinc-deficent rats, alterations in protein and nucleic acid metabolism in the testes were found. Studies of the effects of gonadotropins and testosterone on zinc-65 uptake in male rats also have been carried out. Administration of FSH decreased zinc-65 uptake in tissues of the reproductive tract as well as tissues not involving gonadal function. The nature of the synthetic defect in testosterone metabolism from zinc deficiency has not been clearly established. It is clearly demonstrated that sperm contain the highest concentration of zinc of any bodily tissue per milli- 1338 gram protein. High zinc concentrations have been found in the heads of 604* individual spermatozoa by X-ray microprobe techniques, although this finding 511a has been ascribed by later workers to contamination with seminal vesicle fluid. Zinc is highly concentrated in ova of all species, but its purpose, except as related in some general way to growth and development, is not clear. Changes in the metabolism of pregnant women produced changes in zinc con- 767a,1404,1770a tent of some tissues. In eclampsia of pregnancy, zinc levels decreased to about 10% of their normal amounts. Infectious processes or neo- plasia complicating pregnancy raised the content of placental zinc. It has been 240 image: ------- suggested that loosely bound zinc may affect the epithelial tissues of the uterus. Some toxic states in pregnancy are associated with the loss of zinc by 1138 the placental epithelium. Effects of jflsulin. Because of the high content of zinc in the islets of Langerhans and the prolongation of action of insulin by zinc, a relationship between zinc and diabetes has been sought. In patients with diabetes mellitus without proteinuria, urinary excretion of zinc was reported to be above normal. In patients with diabetes and proteinuria, urinary zinc excretion is 310,717 understandably higher than in normal subjects. Plasma zinc levels of fasting diabetics have been reported to be higher than in normal subjects, and diabetics of more than 10 years' duration have been reported to have plasma zinc 310 levels higher than those in the earlier stages of the disease. Whether or not the extremely high values in diabetics of more than 10 years reflected pro- longed therapy with zinc insulin was not determined. However, in recent studies, no correlation could be obtained between plasma 361 levels of zinc, glucose, or glycosuria. Nevertheless, these investigators 367,717 demonstrated a striking fall in plasma zinc after loading with oral glucose. On the basis of fat-free pancreas tissue, little difference in zinc content of 422 the pancreas from normals or diabetics was measured by some investigators, although others estimated that the zinc content of the pancreas was one-half that 1460 of nondiabetics. These problems have not been resolved yet. In oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests, glucose rose as plasma 361,717 zinc concentration fell; however, the curves were similar for both normal subjects and diabetic patients. In zinc-deficient rats, glucose intolerance was intraperitoneal observed after an / glucose load but not after an oral glucose load. Thus, insulin has a biologic action independent of zinc. However, zinc forms a physiologically active compound with insulin that delays its physiologic 241 image: ------- 1459 action and greatly prolongs the hypoglycemia. Many studies have attempted to elucidate the structure of zinc insulin. Imidazole groups are 165,1570 implicated in the binding of zinc to insulin. The ratio of zinc to the 1271 insulin monomer is approximately 0.5 g atom/mole; in actuality, there are 3 zinc atoms/insulin hexamer. Measuring the kinetics of photooxidation suggested that the rate of photooxidation of zinc-free insulin was considerably faster than 1746 that of zinc insulin. Analyses by X-ray techniques have offered evidence of the structure of crystallized insulin from different species. For example, bovine 391,632 insulin crystals are rhombohedral. Zinc is useful in the crystallization of insulin: if the ash content of crystalline insulin is lowered it will not 1457a,1459 crystallize again unless a metal salt is added. Effects of parathyroid hormone. Patients with untreated hyperparathyroidism 971a,971b exhibited increased urinary zinc excretion. However, the mean concentration of total serum zinc in these patients was normal. Following surgical treatment of the hyperparathyroidism, urinary excretion of zinc decreased among patients whose parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels reverted to normal; in patients with per- 971b sistent hyperparathyroidism, no decrease in urinary zinc occurred after surgery. These clinical results suggest that parathyroid hormone was directly related to body zinc loss from urinary excretion. The results were partially confirmed by studies in which purified parathyroid extract was administered intravenously to two patients in whom urinary zinc excretion increased two- to threefold during the second hour after infusion. However, their urinary cyclic adenosine 3':5f- cyclic phosphate (AMP), which increased after the first 15 min, had returned to 971b baseline levels. There are several possible ways PTH could have produced these results. For example, increased metal excretion observed in patients with untreated primary 242 image: ------- hyperparathyroidism or after PTH infusion could have been the result of an aminoacidurla induced by the PTH excess. About 36% of the patients with primary 346a hyperparathyroidism have been reported to show a generalized aminoaciduria, and intravenous infusion of PTH increases the urinary excretion of histidine and 1491a other araino acids by about 50% within 2 h. Since oral administration of histidine has been shown to increase urinary excretion of zinc, these results are consistent with the concept that the blood histidine strips the zinc normally complexed with albumin, forming histidyl-zinc ligands that are readily excreted 668,679 in the urine. Another possible effect relates to the increased bone turnover 800a commonly observed in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Since a 1640 large proportion of body stores of these metals is located in bone, the in- creased urinary excretion of these metals in hyperparathyroidism may be an index of bone turnover. The increased urinary excretion of copper and zinc observed in 667 acromegaly, a disease in which bone turnover may also be increased, may also reflect this phenomenon. Effects of adrenocortical steroid. Abnormalities of adrenocortical steroid metabolism in man and animals have been linked to changes in copper and zinc 670 metabolism. Adrenalectomy or adrenocortical insufficiency from several causes, including idiopathic Addison's disease and hypopituitarism, have been accompanied by increased serum zinc concentration, decreased urinary zinc excretion and in- 670,677 creased retention of zinc in several tissues. Exogenous replacement of adrenocortical steroids in both man and animals corrects these changes by normalizing the serum concentration, urinary excretion and tissue retention of 479a,670 the metal. 1091b 932 Circadian changes in copper and zinc levels in blood have been associated temporally with the circadian variation observed in the levels of 667 17 hydroxycortical steroids in blood and urine, although administration of 243 image: ------- exogenous carbohydrate-active steroids did not abolish the circadian variation 932 observed for these metals. Conversely, elevated endogenous secretion of adrenocortical steroids, which occurs in Gushing*s syndrome or in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma, has been associated with decreased plasma zinc, increased urinary zinc excretion, and 670,677 decreased tissue retention of zinc. These changes are a consequence of increased excretion of metals. Any treatment of these diseases that helped the excessive endogenous adrenocortical steroid secretion brought about the return of serum copper and zinc concentration to or toward normal, a reduction in urinary 670,677 excretion of zinc and an elevation in tissue levels of zinc. Similar changes in patients with hypersecretion of adrenocortical steroids were observed following oral administration of exogenous carbohydrate-active 670 steroids to normal volunteers. After five days of being dosed with 50 g prednisolone daily, the subjects' serum zinc concentration decreased and urinary zinc excretion increased. These studies indicate an inverse relationship between adrenocortical steroid levels in blood and serum zinc concentration, and a direct relationship between blood levels of adrenocortical steroids and urinary excretion of zinc. These changes may be related directly to some adrenocortical steroids affecting the 669,670 production of increased ultrafilterable zinc in serum. Such changes previously were associated with decreases in serum zinc concentration and increases 670 in urinary zinc excretion. However, increased renal excretion of copper after 1748a adrenal corticosteroid administration may be linked to changes in glomerular filtration produced by adrenocortical steroids. These fluctuations may also affect serum levels and urinary secretion of zinc and copper. It has recently been demonstrated in mammalian cell cultures that zinc uptake was stimulated by the 1205 adrenocortical steroids hydrocortisone and psednisolone. The action of these 244 image: ------- steroids on zinc accumulation was thought to be caused by stabilization of cellu- lar membranes,^since zinc protects membranes from fragmentation during subcellular fractionation. Prostate and Gonads Zinc concentration in the prostate, seminal vesicles, and other associ- ated structures is higher than in any other soft tissue of the body. Table 7-9 lists zinc concentrations in the male reproductive tract. In Sanyal and co-workers' studies of rats, removal of zinc caused irreversible degeneration of the seminiferous tubules of the testes. Degenerative changes were also found in the prostate and seminal vesicles after zinc depletion, but they were reversed after administration 1412a of androgens, chorionic gonadotropins, or zinc supplements. Zinc concentration in prostate tissue undergoing various types of pathologic changes has been reported to vary widely from normal. Verrilli et al. attempted prostatic to make a diagnosis of early/carcinoma and a differential diagnosis of prostatic nodules by studying the differential uptake and distribution of zinc-65 throughout prostatic tissue; their efforts were unsuccessful in making a selective differ- entiation.1685 245 image: ------- TABLE 7-9 a Zinc in the Male Reproductive Tract~ yg/g Fresh Tissue Mean 73-189 41-130 57-295 39-305 54-86 Number of 9 9 12 17 10 a \"Data from Lindholmer and Glauman. 937 246 image: ------- Zinc in prostatic cancer, studied by the assay of individual tissue sections, 1443 confirmed previous findings of lower than normal levels of zinc in this tissue. However, a high zinc level in prostate has been observed in benign prostatic 1443 hyperplasia. Normal human prostatic fluid contains a high level of zinc, and in cases of benign hyperplasia the most elevated zinc levels were in prostatic fluid, an extracellular fluid, instead of within cells. The in vitro uptake of zinc-65 was highest in cases of prostatic cancer and lowest in prostatic hyper- plasia. An inverse relationship has been observed between zinc concentrations 594 and the in vivo and in vitro binding capacity of zinc-65 in different patho- 593 logic stages of prostatic tissue. Further evidence showed that zinc within the prostate was bound to sulfonated-acid mucopolysaccharides: autoradiographs indicated that zinc binding areas corresponded to areas of acid mucopoly- 593 saccharides. A zinc-binding protein has been isolated from human benign hypertrophic 659 prostate tissue. Analysis of amino acids in this protein reveals a very high molar ratio of histidine. The importance and specificity of this finding awaits further investigation. Because of the wide variation of zinc reported in prostate\u2014ranging from 709,1443 30 to 2,315 yg/g dried tissue\u2014 several investigators attempted to cor- relate zinc concentration in prostate by the histologically estimated ratio of zinc in and 835a,948b epithelium / stroma. However, the results were not very useful. 544a Gonic e al. stated that zinc prostate concentration varied inversely with prostatic the amount of/fibromuscular stroma. In an attempt to establish some standard, several investigators attempted to correlate levels of zinc and 3-glucuronidase 1091a,1091c,1143a activity in prostatic tissue. Their results indicated a good correlation between zinc concentrations and B-glucuronidase activity in noncar- cinomatous tissue but not in carcinomatous tissue. 247 image: ------- Several investigators, using techniques correlating zinc levels with histo- chemical enzyme activity, confirmed the extremely low levels of zinc in carcino- 593,1091c matous prostatic tissue (40-50 ug/g tissue wet wt), and reached fairly good agreement about the level of zinc in noncarcinomatous prostatic tissue 140a,1091c 948b,993,1091c,1766a Since patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy exhibit elevated levels of zinc in prostate, treatment with several chelating agents has been suggested as a way of producing decreases in the symptoms associated with this condition and de- 593,948b,1008a,1443 creases in the size of the prostate. These results have not been tested in controlled clinical trials, yet they do appear encouraging. These effects could be explained as an effect of the chelating agents on the noncarcinomatous prostate cells such that hyperplastic areas of the prostate are shrunk. Low levels of zinc in prostate have been observed not only in carcinoma of the prostate, but in patients on zinc-deficient diets. Low levels of zinc also have been observed in the prostatic fluid and testes of patients with zinc deficiency! In recent years the incidence of hypogonadism among zinc-deficient subjects has 383,1174,1277 been noted, and the relatively high concentrations of zinc in the prostate gland and in sperm have been related to the role that zinc plays in interaction gonadal function. However, this / has not been clearly defined. In a double- blind study of zinc-deficient Egyptian dwarfs given either placebo or supplemental zinc, no differences in growth or gonadal function could be demonstrated between 1410 the two treatments. Studies have been carried out in which gonadal weight and zinc content of rats fed zinc-deficient diets have been compared with similar measurements made in controls fed restricted amounts of food. Interpretation of 993 this study is difficult since 3-4 rats were grouped in each cage, thereby 248 image: ------- greatly increasing the variability of the results. Exogenous testosterone or pituitary gonadatropins also have been given to rats fed zinc-deficient diets, 1045b but as pair-fed controls were not studied simultaneously interpretation of these results is limited. However, there is little question that decreased testicular weight in zinc-deficient rats is a consistent feature associated with zinc deficiency. Differences in morphology between the testes of zinc-deficient and pair-fed control rats indicate a true spermatogenic arrest in the zinc-deficient animals in 1272a one study. Although destruction of the germinal epithelium was not observed, 1045b which others had noted, decreased tubular size was apparent, as was the absence or marked diminution in number of sperm. The presence of Leydig cells 1272a in the testes of zinc-deficient rats was notedin one study. Vacuolated 1272a nuclei of the spermatocytes were reported in this same study. Zinc deficiency also has been observed to reduce the diameter of testicular tubules and to pro- duce atrophy of the up to the spermatogonia stage with 1045b sloughing of cells into the tubular lumen. This latter change became more apparent as the zinc deficiency was prolonged. It must be pointed out that starvation, i.e., pair-feeding per se, apparently did not produce significant 1272a histopathologic changes in the rat testes. That zinc deficiency alters gonadal function is clear; however, the manner by which it occurs is unclear. Either zinc is involved in some aspect of gonadal function other than testosterone synthesis, e.g., in the synthesis or release of pituitary LH or FSH, or the inanition produced by zinc deficiency impairs gonadotropin release. Although little data are available to support either hypothesis, previous studies suggest that zinc and gonadatropin function may be interrelated. Exogenous administration of gonadotropins to zinc-deficient rats 1045b increased the weight of epididymis but did not alter testicular zinc concentration. 249 image: ------- Although the results of these studies were quite variable and pair-fed rats were not studied, some gonads of zinc-deficient rats appeared to mature once gonado- tropins were administered. These animals' pituitaries were small in size and more morphologic \"gonadotrophs\" were recognized when compared with those of normally fed controls. In some ways the morphologic appearance of the testes of zinc-deficient rats is similar to that of patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; i.e., a spermatogenic arrest accompanied by spennatogonia and Leydig cells is observed in both conditions. In addition to these effects of zinc deficiency on testicular function, zinc 1766 in high concentrations can be spermicidal. Renal Function Extrapolations from model studies suggest that the unhindered passage of zinc-amino acid complexes in normal plasma across the renal glomerulus would re- sult in a calculated filtered load of 2 mg zinc in a normal 24-h glomerular filtrate 537 537,668,1503,1551,1666 of 183 1. Observations of several investigators indicate that under normal conditions about 0.5 mg zinc is excreted in urine daily. Thus, the major part of the normal filtered load of amino acid-complexed zinc must be reabsorbed by the kidney. Although earlier workers suggested that urinary zinc excretion was not a function of intake, this notion may require further evaluation because many recent studies have questioned it. If plasma zinc shifts such that more or less zinc is complexed with micro- 668 molecular ligands, normal zinc transport and storage processes may be altered. An increase in micromolecular zinc ligands (amino acid-zinc ligands) crossing the renal glomerulus could lead to excessive loss of zinc through urine. Albuminuria would lead to hyperzincuria as well. 250 image: ------- The manner by which zinc is reabsorbed by the kidney is not clear, although analyses by laser microprobe and histochemical techniques have suggested that a high concentration of zinc resides in the proximal tubule of the kidney, where reabsorption may be expected to take place.668'1483 if reabsorption of zinc occurs, then the role of metallothionein as an agent in the conservation of zinc could be an important one. However, agents such as carbonic anhydrase and alka- line phosphatase\u2014both zinc-containing enzymes\u2014have been shown to occur in high 541a concentrations at the brush border of the renal tubule. Thus, although zinc loss is controlled primarily through size discrimination at the renal glomerulus (which inhibits the loss of macromolecular-liganded zinc moieties) , specific properties of other substances and enzymes influence the tubular reabsorption of a very large amount of zinc. Schroeder has shown that kidneys of human subjects dying from hypertensive complications had increased concentrations of cadmium or increased cadmium in 1444 relation to zinc. The systolic hypertension in rats caused by cadmium salts may be reversed by injecting a chelate of zinc with a higher stability constant 430,1448 for cadmium than for zinc. It has not only been concluded that cadmium plays some role in hypertension, but that the ratio of cadmium to zinc is very important. In metallothionein, which contains both zinc and cadmium, these two metals may interact with the same binding site and functionally replace each other. Since the physiologic role of this protein is not understood, these data cannot be specially related to renal pathology. All data suggest that, in the 1451 kidney, cadmium and zinc are closely related. In Figure 7-9, Schroeder et al. have shown that the concentration of zinc and cadmium in kidneys changes in amount and ratio in different decades of human life. The curves represent mean concentrations of 221 subjects. The difference in peak levels in age groups between 40 and 50 is statistically significant. 251 image: ------- Cd Zn ppm ratio ash 07 06 05 0., 0.3 0.2 01 00 7000 6000 5000 4000 3000 2000 1000 x \u2014 x / ^ < _ _^ ., .,//- * 'S / --'\"\" 0'\"\"-- \\ S ' \\ Si .' \u00b0 FIGURE 7-9 Mean concentrations of cadmium and zinc and their ratios in kidneys in 221 subjects from the United States. Reproduced from Schroeder et a 252 image: ------- Zinc has been found in a large number of urinary calculi, and in some patients with calcium oxalate renal calculi, hyperzincuria has been 430,1336 observed. Additional studies have suggested that only men with renal 294,343 calculi exhibit hyperzincuria. Hydrochlorothiazide has been suggested as a useful agent for preventing calcific renal stones.1810'1811 1193 Administration of this drug also produces a significant hyperzincuria, but evidently without significant cupruria. Zinc has been found to increase the 429 solubility of calcium oxalate in vitro, which may relate to the mechanism of this effect. However, sodium cellulose phosphate, another agent used in the treatment of some forms of renal stones, has no effect on renal 1192 excretion of zinc. Nephrocalcinosis was produced in rats fed a diet deficient in magnesium and zinc, and these renal stones were more common in females than 1810 in males. Muscle Function Several studies over the past 20 years have attempted to establish a role for zinc in muscle function. This function has not been clearly defined, but zinc might be necessary to muscle contractility. Although not directly related, examinations of cupric and zinc ions bound to crystalline sperm whale myoglobin and studied by X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the metals are bound by histidine and probably by lysine and asparagine V side chains with high affinity to myoglobin. Cann has suggested 227 that zinc ion alters the iron-imidazole linkages in myoglobins. The reaction of zinc with myoglobin causes major changes in physical and chemical properties of the protein. The most characteristic spectral change is a marked reduction 226,227 of Soret band intensity, which shifts the peak of absorption to 390 mm. Whether metal ions other than the iron atom of theheme group is physiologically involved in the function of myoglobin is not known. 253 image: ------- Collagen Recent studies in rats indicate an important role for zinc in collagen 732 formation. For example, a primarily copper- and 733b iron-dependent enzyme, lysyl oxidase, was shown to be zinc-dependent as well. Cross linking per se appears to require zinc. Zinc deficiency appears to be associated with a decreased proline . uptake in the epiphyses, a de- proline to hydroxyproline, lowered sulfur- 923 1142 35 uptake and decreased epithelial shearing strength. ' Because zinc is important for the activity of alkaline phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase has been related to the secretion of collagen and/or mucopolysaccharides, then a role for zinc in this system may be reasonably surmised. Zinc also may inhibit 1083 the pyrophosphatase activity of alkaline phosphatase in humans. Hematopoiesis and Red Blood and White Blood Cell Function In vitro studies of zinc-65 transport into leukocytes and erythrocytes and 1041,1164 into erthyrocyte carbonic anhydrase carried out. Zinc-65 377 uptake in leukemic leukocytes has been found to be only half that of normal cells. Carbonic anhydrase, first discovered in bovine erythrocytes, has been found 831 in several human tissues. Three forms have been found in human erythrocytes 33,901,1151 and named carbonic anhydrase: A, B, and C. These different forms are similar in their role in catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide, in their molecular weights, and in the one atom of zinc in each molecule. Studies of the mode of binding with different inhibitors, especially some derivatives of sulfonamides, described the mode of action of the active site and 302 the differences between them. Carbonic anhydrase B has at least one histidine 1767,1768 molecule located in the active site region close to the metal. Using t zinc-65, it was shown by kinetics that immediate inactivation is caused by the formation of an inert ternary complex and that the mobilization of zinc proceeds 235 slowly by formation of the apoenzyme. Infrared spectrophotometry revealed that bound carbon dioxide attacked the hydroxyl coordinated to the zinc 1346,1347 ion. Other investigators studied the structure of the active site of this 254 image: ------- enzyme; they constructed a model that corresponded to the active site.388\"390 Both human carbonic anhydrases B and C act as esterases on g- and - nitrophenyl acetates and the mechanism of the carbon dioxide hydration re- 1684 action may be extended to the esterase reaction. Chelating agents such as 0-phenanthroline at pH 4 and below may remove zinc and deactivate 414 the enzyme. The metal specificity of the enzyme seems to be independent of 1613 the substrate. 1365,1588, Alkaline phosphatase also has been found in white blood cells of man, 1629 and its concentration has been shown to be abnormal in several blood 1365 dyscrasias. Reverse transcriptase, a metalloprotein containing two zinc 1255 atoms per mole of protein, has been isolated and a function in human leukemia 596 has been suggested. Sensory Function* The role of zinc in taste and smell has been documented in humans and 331,617,621,666,671,673,679,680,1004 animals. Zinc deficiency is associated with loss of taste and smell acuity and the appearance of dysgeusia, dysosmia, and 621,666,671 666 pica in man. Zinc may be a component of the taste bud and in subjects with 678,1087 normal taste acuity it has been shown to be present in the saliva that bathes the taste bud. Several causes of loss of taste acuity in humans are 678,1087 associated with decreases in salivary zinc concentration and the 671,680 appearance of pathologic changes in the taste buds. Zinc is an integral part of a protein known to be secreted by the human parotid gland. The function of this protein appears to be related to the maintenance of normal taste bud 674 form and function. Zinc also may affect the visual system. Zinc has been found in high concen- trations in the choroid of the eye. a This concentration has been caused by *See also Chapter 10. image: ------- localization of the metal Ln the tnpatum lucidum ceLluloaum, which la thought to b\u00ab reaponaiblu for tha light reflection Mean in the ayes of carnivoraa.

Cardiovascular System Little is known about the specific role of zinc in the function of any particular aspect of the cardiovascular system, but important relationships have been postulated. As already noted, an interaction between renal cadmium and zinc 1444,1448 has been suggested as an influence on some forms of hypertension. The urinary excretion of cadmium was greater in 95 hypertensive women treated with antihypertensive agents than in 107 normotensive women, but zinc excretion was 1013 the same in both groups. Carroll attempted to link the zinc concentration in air and the incidence of cardiovascular disease\u2014including hypertension\u2014in 240 28 North American cities. His results are difficult to correlate with the multiple or indirectly / clinical factors that directly/relate to the pathogenesis of the disease processes. Some investigators have suggested that zinc deficiency may be a factor in fiofi I oi the development of atherosclerosis * and that zinc therapy is useful in the 686 treatment of some of the symptoms of obliterative vascular disease. One investigator noted that the zinc content of the aorta of atherosclerotic patients, 1703 particularly in the areas of the atherosclerotic plaque, was markedly decreased; he also noted that these patients exhibited decreased zinc in plasma, liver, myocardium, pancreas and hair. It has been suggested that accumulation of zinc 1133 in the renal cortex promotes aortic atheromata and hypertension. Another 474 group experimenting with hypertensive dogs could not find these large differences; these studies were carried out in animals with a different set of cardiovascular problems. Zinc-protamine-glucagon has been claimed to be useful 258 image: ------- in the relief of symptoms related to cardiac insufficiency,812 although the role of zinc itself in this complex may not be critical. After acute myocardial infarction, human serum zinc concentration falls. >17U Dogs with experimentally produced myocardial infarctions had reduced zinc concen- 936 trations in the infarcted area. However, no differences in zinc were found in heart muscle analyzed from patients who died from acute coronary thromboses 274 although magnesium levels were decreased. In addition, zinc was carefully measured in the thoracic aorta of patients with graded levels of atherosclerosis and differences between those subjects and patients not suffering from cardio- 1310 vascular disorders could not be measured. Such diverse results make it dif- ficult to ascertain the specific influence of zinc in cardiovascular function. Other Enzymatic Activities Zinc complexes with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to form Zn.ADP, ZnADP, and Zn(ADP>2 in solutions. Zinc markedly reduced the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to AMP in lipocytes 1784 when used alone or with magnesium. ATP-metal-norepinephrine ternary complexes may be of major importance to the understanding of the biologic 298 phenomenon of binding or storage of catecholamines in vivo. 244,1231 Zinc has also been found to affect the activity of ATPase, acid 1728 yeast of several enzymes, including 158,690 1698 ribonuclease, allantoinases inhibition for each enzyme is specific. 1005 Superoxide dismutase, an enzyme important in oxygen metabolism, contains 645 two zinc atoms, perhaps as structural components of the enzyme. Zinc is bound 490 at the histidine site of this enzyme. 259 image: ------- Zinc-a2~glycoprotein, with a molecular weight of 43,000, is present in 1427 most body fluids and has been isolated from normal plasma. It is found in low concentrations in normal serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and in higher concentrations in urine, saliva and sweat. This glycoprotein appears to be homogeneous, as shown by ultracentrifugation, electrophoresis, chromatography and N-terminal-ami no acid analyses. In the low pH range, the protein appears in several fractions even after the removal of sialic acid. The polymorphism of zinc-(X2~glycoprotein may be an expression of genetically determined 1429 variants. The zinc-a2~glycoprotein should not be confused with the major serum macromolecular binding protein of zinc-a2~niacroglobulin noted in the beginning of this chapter. 260 image: ------- CHAPTER 8 ZINC IN THE DIET AND THE EFFECTS OF ZINC DEFICIENCY IN ANIMALS* Zinc must be present in the diet of all animals, including man. Moreover, it must be supplied In the diet almost continuously, because animals have only small amounts of readily available zinc stored in the body. This condition exists although the body contains a relatively 1640 large amount of zinc, particularly in bones, skin, and hair. However, zinc in these tissues cannot normally be utilized by the animal to meet its need for zinc. LACK OF ZINC IN THE DIET The primary effect of insufficient zinc in the diet is decreased food intake and cessation of growth. The effect is quite rapid; growth 1195,1782 stops almost Immediately in rats and in about 2 wk in calves 1064 and lambs. Other signs of zinc deficiency observed in young growing animals are listed in Table 8-1. It should be emphasized that the additional symptoms described generally were observed in very young animals that would have been in an active stage of growth. Somewhat older animals will also stop growing soon after being placed on a zinc- deficient diet but may not show other signs of deficiency. Six-to-nine- month old calves, for example, failed to grow after being placed on the 1064 deficient diet, but showed no other clinical signs of deficiency. Undoubtedly, adult animals are also affected by a lack of zinc in the diet, but less information exists on the effects of a low zinc diet *Work discussed in this chapter appeared in the literature prior to 1640 April 1975. Papers included in Underwood's comprehensive review generally have not been covered here. *See Chapter 10 for symptoms in'humans. 261 image: ------- TABLE 8-1 atoms of Zinc Deficiency in Young Animals and Approximate Requirements for Zinc Species Ruminants Cattle Sheep Deficiency Symptoms Parakeratosis, increased bacteria in mouth, stiffness of joints with swelling of feet, horny over- growths, excessive salivation (transitory)1050 Salivation (transitory), increased bacteria in mouth, parakeratosis of tongue, '^ loosening of wool, distortion of hoof walls and horns10** Goats Swine Poultry Chicken Similar to cattle 1114 Parakeratosis 1127 Poor feathering, shortening and thickening of long bones of legs and wings, hock enlargement, reduced egg production and hatchability, skeletal abnormali- ties in embryos Turkey Japanese quail Laboratory Animals Abnormal feathering, nated gait1699 uncoordi- Rat esophagus, cyclic food impairment of reproductive function1\"40 401108 Egg white: 151064 (somewhat chick (0-8 wk):50 (1.5 times this amount may be required during first week to prevent abnormal feather development) 72 Breeding hens: 65 Poults (0-8 wk): TABLE 8-1 continued Species Mouse Rabbit Guinea pig Monkey Dog Mink Deficiency Symptoms Alopecia1112 Sparse hair, reddening around mouth, wet and matted hair on lower Jaw and ruff, impair- ment of reproductive function in the female4*'1480 Rough Alopecia, hyperkeratinization, acanthosis1^^ (symptoms and requirement based on single study in which a simple zinc deficiency probably was not present) 1001 Approximate Requirement >3 1112 diet: 20 1109 <20- a Symptoms listed are in addition to growth failure and decreased food consumption. - Mg/kg feed, dry weight. - Unpublished data, H.

Studies with rats indicate that a low zinc diet inter- 1154,1408 feres with wound healing in the adult male and with estrous 45,544 1640 cycling and reproduction in the adult female. Skin lesions have been reported in adult humans whose zinc intake has been very low for 199 2 mo. REQUIREMENT FOR ZINC IN THE DIET Table 8-1 also estimates the amount of zinc that various animals require in order to grow normally. Adult animals presumably require some- what less than the amounts listed, except during periods of stress such as pregnancy and lactation. The amount of zinc required varies somewhat with the type of diet, because diets which contain seed protein (such as soy protein) may increase the requirement for zinc. There may be other conditions under which the requirement for zinc is increased, since deficiencies have been reported in ruminants in the field on zinc intakes which, based on laboratory studies, should have been adequate. A lower than normal requirement for zinc has been reported in 1513 germ-free rats and a higher than normal requirement in a breed of 179 Danish calves with hereditary thymus hypoplasia. A genetic difference has been suggested to affect the requirement of pigs. \"\u00b0 Normally, little zinc is available to the body except that ingested in the diet, and therefore zinc must be supplied in the diet more or less continuously. Under some conditions, however, zinc stored in the tissues may become available to the body. Such conditions include muscle and/or 462 1532 skin catabolism after severe injury, starvation, low protein 760 762,1599 intakes, and bone resorption during low calcium intake. The animal may also be able to make some adjustment to a low zinc intake 264 image: ------- through decreased excretion of zinc and perhaps by increased absorption 199,447,1048,1456 efficiency. Ruminants Cattle. The suggested zinc requirement for cattle is 40 ppm for 1108 Hl4a dairy cattle and 10-30 ppm for beef cattle. This rather wide range exists because zinc deficiencies occur in the field on intakes of zinc substantially higher than those which appear to be adequate under experimental conditions. Under experimental conditions, 8 ppm was sufficient for calves to 1064 grow,although plasma zinc levels were still low. This concentration may be very close to the minimum, because in another study calves receiving 1052 7-8 ppm became severely deficient. On an intake of 17 ppm, lactating cows did not show signs of deficiency nor was milk production affected, 1123 although the zinc concentration of the milk was decreased by about 25%. 1124,1126,1212,1213 Cows receiving low levels (5-17 ppm) of zinc absorbed 1125 and retained more zinc-65 than did cows fed 40 ppm. Addition of zinc to a. barley-hay ration containing 25-32 ppm zinc did not improve weight 1302 gain of beef heifers. The experiments indicate that 30 ppm should be an adequate zinc intake for beef cattle; but zinc supplements given to beef calves in Greece on a ration already containing 32 ppm zinc resulted in a 7% greater weight gain, and deficiences were reported in the field 1528 on Intakes of 20-40 ppm. Young Fresian bulls on a barley-swede turnip ration containing 30-50 ppm zinc developed a pododermatitis that 375 was healed by oral zinc administration although growth was never affected. Facial eczema in dairy cattle in New Zealand was treated 1345a successfully with zinc supplements, although forage in the area had 552 not been considered to be low in the metal. 265 image: ------- The above cases suggest that some unknown factor influences the zinc requirement of cattle. One possibility is phytate, although phytate 1050 content of the diet has not been considered to be a problem in ruminants. Another factor that has not been carefully considered is soil ingestion. 657 Dairy cows may consume 1 Ib (0.45 kg) or more of soil a day. In 658,1510 some cases, animals might be able to utilize the zinc in the soil, but ingestion of other soil types might reduce the availability of zinc. Stress also may increase the requirement for zinc. Sheep and goats. Although severe zinc deficiency has been developed 1064,1204 in sheep, little evidence exists of zinc deficiency occurring in sheep in the field. A field survey of plasma levels of zinc in sheep in 552 various parts of New Zealand indicated that sheep in some areas had plasma zinc levels as low as animals reduced in growth by experimental 1064,1204 zinc deficiency. However, no cases of zinc deficiency were observed. A survey of 600 sheep in Greece showed that 1% of them had severe symptoms of zinc deficiency, and 60% had milder symptoms probably 1204 associated with other factors (other deficiencies, poor management, etc.). Zinc or zinc plus manganese supplements were reported to have improved repro- ductive performance in ewes in Australia although management was apparently 418 also involved. It is not known whether sheep are more resistant to zinc deficiency than cattle, or if zinc deficiency in the field merely has not been recog- nized. Sheep may need less zinc than cattle because deficiencies developed 1204 in sheep on a dietary level of 4 ppm zinc in the same amount of time 1052 in which deficiency symptoms developed in calves on 7-8 ppm dietary zinc. 656 The large amounts of soil ingested by sheep and the ability of sheep 658 ruminal fluid to extract zinc from it may also offer protection. 266 image: ------- Zinc deficiency in goats has not been studied much. Nine-month-old male goats on a diet of 4 ppm zinc developed signs of deficiency in about 1127 5 wk. Adult female goats on a diet of 6-7 ppm did not develop signs of zinc deficiency until they were lactating. Milk production was not affected, but the zinc content of the milk dropped to approximately 50% of that pro- 569 duced by the controls after a month's lactation. Male kids raised on the 6-7 ppm diet were severely stunted, but females apparently were not 375,945 affected. Other observations have indicated that the growing intact males have an increased zinc requirement, but the differences have not been as large as those reported in this experiment. It would seem that other 1204 factors must have been involved. The survey of ruminants in Greece mentioned previously found that 2% of the 150 goats examined exhibited severe symptoms of zinc deficiency. Swine Although 14-20 ppm zinc appears to be adequate for pigs on a diet 1479 with casein as the protein source, the requirement on a soy-based diet 1114 (in which the zinc is less available) is 50 ppm. However, soy is not the only feed that increases the zinc requirement; pigs on a cassava-rice bran diet supplying 40 ppm zinc displayed symptoms of zinc deficiency, 992 whereas pigs on a corn-soy (20%) diet with 48 ppm zinc developed normally. Swine receiving a 13% soy meal intake showed no signs of deficiency although the zinc concentration was only 32-34 ppm. Not surprisingly, neither the 1188 additions of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) uor pre- 1187 chelated trace minerals to this diet improved weight gain of the pigs. Addition of low levels of the pre-chelated trace minerals was said to produce poorer results than the basal diet without the added trace elements; 267 image: ------- but none of the results were strikingly different and considerable discrepancy was found between the amount of trace minerals cal- culated to be in the diet and the actual content determined by analysis. For the pig in particular, high calcium levels increase the zinc 614 requirement in diets containing large amounts of seed protein. Rat 99, Zinc deficiency has been studied extensively in the growing rat. 846,847,1195,1196,1197,1236,1640,1782 A casein diet containing 8 ppm zinc yielded maximum growth, but 15 ppm was required to maintain bone 1197 and whole body zinc at normal levels. Humans Zinc was included in the list of recommended dietary allowances 1119 (RDA) for humans for the first time in 1974, and recommended levels are given in Table 8-2. These recommendations are based partly on the average intake of apparently healthy people and partly on balance studies. In a balance study the amount of zinc ingested in the diet is compared to that excreted in the urine and feces. Because the studies are cumbersome, they usually involve small numbers of people for short periods of time on a limited range of intakes. Such data allow only a crude approximation of the requirement, but they provide the best information currently available. Levels similar to those of the RDA's also were arrived at by 1806 a committee of the World Health Organization. Requirements in this case were based partly on considerations of changes in lean body mass at 1404 various ages. The adequacy of 15 mg zinc daily for adults is supported by recent 1532 1354 studies in which both adult American men and young New Zealand women 268 image: ------- TABLE 8-2 Recommended Dietary Allowances For Zinc Infants Children Men Women Pregnant Lactating 6 9 13 20 30 44 61 67 70 70 44 54 58 58 58 (Ibs) 14 20 28 44 66 97 134 147 154 154 97 119 128 128 128 Height (cm) 60 71 86 110 135 158 172 172 172 172 155 162 162 162 162 (in) 24 28 34 44 54 63 69 69 69 69 62 65 65 65 65 Zinc (mg) 3 5 10 10 10 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 20 25 ?rt>m Recommended Dietary Allowances. 1119 269 image: ------- were in balance on a daily intake of approximately 17 mg. Adults have also 504,614,643,1119 been reported to be in balance on lower intakes. A zinc intake of 4.5 mg in a diet typical of low income groups appeared to be marginally adequate for 7-9-yr-old girls when additional nitrogen was added 1298 to the diet. Levels of zinc in diets of children from different insti- 1102 tutions varied from 2.7-6.4 mg/day. The allowance for the infant is based primarily on the estimated zinc intake of an infant receiving breast milk. This amount may not be enough to maintain bottle-fed infants in positive zinc balance, because an intake of 1 mg/kg body weight was necessary to keep infants less than a month old in positive zinc balance. In 3-4-month-old 471 infants, positive balances could be maintained with 0.75 mg. The rapid decline in the zinc concentration in infants' hair in the U.S. shortly 617 after birth may also be an indicator that zinc intake is marginal. 615,621a Hair zinc in infants in Thailand was not low after birth, and hair zinc in infants in England did not decline as much as it did in the 614a U.S. In addition, supplementing an infant milk formula with zinc 1722 increased the growth of male infants by age 6 mo. However, evidence from animal studies shows that some change in zinc metabolism takes place after birth, as plasma zinc levels decreased shortly after birth in both 757 879 rats and pigs. More information is needed on the zinc requirements of infants and children. 562 Total parenteral nutrition also substantially lowered the plasma zinc levels in two infants. Trace element formulas for use in intravenous . , 749,1483a hyperalimentation solutions for children and adults have been described. 270 image: ------- Reproduction Female. Zinc requirements for pregnancy and lactation have not been extensively studied. In the rat and pig, the zinc level that allowed maxi- 1780,1782 mum growth was also adequate for gestation: 12 ppm in the rat and 65,1607b 20 ppm for swine on a casein diet and 34 ppm for a corn-soy diet. The requirement for lactation is assumed to be higher than that for gesta- tion. An adequate zinc intake for gestation in the goat resulted in severe 569 deficiency during lactation. Little is known about the effect of zinc on reproduction in the human female except that plasma and hair zinc levels decrease during 616 614 pregnancy and with intake of oral contraceptives. To some extent, 1000 this may simply reflect a redistribution of zinc in the body. Pregnant teenagers who were given 30 mg zinc daily still maintained lower levels of plasma zinc during the ninth month of gestation than they had 6 wk after 1439 parturition. Nonetheless, the values were higher than those reported 616 for normally noumished women in the ninth month of pregnancy. Zinc concentrations in plasma and hair two days after parturition were lower in women in Iran that had been living in villages or under low socioeconomic conditions in the city than in those that had been living in higher socio- 1414 economic levels in the city. (But an attempt to correlate decreased plasma zinc with abnormal outcome of pregnancy in East Harlem was 1515 unsuccessful. ) Several unsuccessful pregnancies have been reported 618 in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica, a condition in which very low plasma zinc levels have been reported. It recently has been 1085,1129a,1520a discovered that the condition responds to zinc therapy. The possibility of zinc deficiency occurring in human pregnancy 721,1474a,1475 has been of particular concern because zinc deficiency in 757,759, rats has been shown to cause congenital malformations. 761,761a,1640,1732 To what extent these results are applicable to humans is 271 image: ------- unknown. When evaluating these results one must remember that extremely low zinc diets are required to produce the malformations, and that so far the only reported experiments have been conducted with rats. The results of the rat studies may not be applicable to other species since vitamin deficiencies, for example, have been known for a long time to be terato- 1730 genie in the rat; but comparable effects have not been seen in humans. Similar experiments are difficult to simulate in other animals, and apparently no experiments have been done on animals with long gestation times and only one or two offspring. For animals that do not bear large litters, zinc may be more important to normal mating and maintenance of pregnancy. Male. A zinc intake somewhat higher than that required for normal growth may be necessary to support normal reproductive function in the male. Male sheep receiving a diet containing 17 ppm zinc exhibited reduced testic- ular weight, low volume of seminal fluid, and an increased percentage of abnormal sperm, compared to sheep receiving 32 ppm zinc, although food 1642 intake and weight gains for the two groups were the same. Young bulls developed a zinc-responsive pododermatitis.although steers and heifers were 375 unaffected. In the rat, the developing testes seem to be particularly susceptible 383,1174,1640,1642 to zinc deficiency. Because the testes of rats with restricted food intake are not affected, the effect appears to be primarily 383,1642 a result of lack of zinc and not secondary to low food intake. Changes in the adult male goat after relatively longer periods of zinc defi- 1127 ciency were apparently related more to lowered food consumption. 272 image: ------- SOURCES OF ZINC IN THE DIET \u00bb. In an average diet, most of the zinc will be supplied with the protein ingested. Table 8-3 sets forth the approximate zinc content of foods relatively high in zinc.

Two servings of meat will probably supply approximately half the daily requirement. Nuts, legumes, and whole grains also contain relatively large amounts of zinc, but the zinc in these foods may not be as available as the zinc in meats (see discussion of phytate). The zinc content of foods as published in the literature has been 1425 comprehensively reported. Some additional zinc values of various foods 1179 1826 are listed by Osis; of wheat and wheat products by Zook; and of 1100, market milk and evaporated milk, infant products, and human milk by Murphy. 1101 1115 Zinc contents of a few forages and animal foods have also been reported. Representative zinc values for a number of common foods have been compiled by the Consumer and Food Economics Institute, United States Department of Agrl- 109 3a culture (USDA). These tables listing zinc content of foods make up Appendix A. 1179 Since the values for cooked meat and fish are not very different from what would be expected based on the values given for raw muscle, loss of zinc in cooking meat appears small. Canned vegetables have been reported 1446 to have 40-80% less zinc than fresh vegetables. Since a negligible pro- portion of zinc in the diet comes from fruits and vegetables other than legumes, loss of zinc from this source would be of little consequence. In addition, the canned and fresh vegetables that were compared in the study were not from the same lot, so zinc contents may have been different even before processing. The most serious losses in processing are those that occur in refined foods such as wheat. For example, whole wheat bread has 1826 three times as much zinc as white bread. 274 image: ------- Although the concentration of zinc in milk is relatively low, an adult who drinks a pint (0.47 1) of milk a day can get 107. of the zinc requirement from this source. Reports of zinc concentration in cows' 1101,1593 1093a milk varied from 3 to 8 yg/g, with 4 yg/g given as the average. 1771a 1100,1175,1244 Human milk was reported to have the same or less zinc than cows' milk. It is possible that zinc in human milk is absorbed more efficiently, however, since plasma zinc levels fell from 60 to 39 yg/100 ml in a 2-yr-old boy with acrodermatitis enteropathica when he was no longer 619 given human milk. Improvement in patients with acrodermatitis who are 1085 given human milk may, of course, be from some factor other than increased 1107 1639 zinc absorption. Colostrum and partum mare's milk had twice as much zinc as milk obtained at later times. Availability As was mentioned when discussing the requirement for zinc, the amount of zinc needed in some diets is higher than in others. Presumably this is caused by a difference in the availability of zinc in these diets. (Some factors associated with reduced availability of zinc in certain diets are discussed in the following section on interrelationships between zinc and oth<=>.r dietary components.) Some work has been done to determine the best way of measuring the availability of zinc. Differences in zinc concentration that varied with protein source were found in tibia of young Japanese quail although the birds' body 634a weight was not affected. Rats on a moderately low zinc diet also 104 showed a difference in tibia zinc, although again body weight was similar. 103 Tibia zinc increased in rats from 3-16 weeks of age on normal diets. Total zinc in the femurs of young rats repleted with 12 ppm dietary zinc 275 image: ------- 1076 were reported to be linear. In a similar experiment, however, the zinc 1371 content of bone increased only slightly. Bone zinc concentration 254,1371 decreased rapidly in rats on a low zinc diet. In rats, at least, bone zinc does not seem to be any better a measure of zinc availability than is an increase in body weight in rats fed diets in which the amount of zinc is less than that required for normal growth. Fortification To meet the RDA of 15 mg zinc/day, one must eat a fairly high protein diet. From the data in Table 8-3, one can estimate that an adult who has an egg and two pieces of whole wheat toast for breakfast, chicken for lunch and roast beef for supper would consume approximately 12 mg zinc. If meat is eaten only once a day, with cereals or legumes as the protein source for other meals, the zinc intake would be significantly less. To raise the zinc content of low protein diets, fortification of cereal foods with 22 ppm zinc has been recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research 1117 Council. Even with fortification of cereals it would be very difficult for a woman on a low protein diet to meet the recommended allowance of zinc for pregnancy and lactation. Even a woman on a high protein diet would have difficulty meeting the 25 mg requirement for lactation without a zinc supplement. zinc. Institutional diets generally fall below the 15 mg/day standard for 1033,1451 INTERRELATIONS BETWEEN ZINC AND OTHER DIETARY COMPONENTS Phycace Since most instances of zinc deficiency in the field have occurred in diets in which most of the protein was obtained from plant sources 276 image: ------- (and seeds in particular), zinc from plants is considered to be less available to monogastric animals and chickens than is zinc derived from animal protein. This distinction has been attributed to the presence of large amounts of phytic acid (inositolhexaphosphoric acid) or phytate in seeds. It has been recognized that soy protein increases the need for zinc in the diet, presumably because of the protein's phytate 904 content. Other seed meals have the same properties as soy so that their use also might increase the zinc requirement. Protein concentrate from mustard or rapeseed which also contained high levels of phytate interfered with reproduction in female rats when it was fed from the time of breeding 1015a to parturition. Since serum zinc levels were low, the effects were attributed to zinc deficiency; but the performance of females receiving these diets along with increased levels of zinc was not tested. A cassava- rice bran diet caused zinc deficiency in pigs, although the zinc level in 992 the diet was 45 ppm. The high level of phytate in rice bran\u2014approximately 5%\u2014may have been responsible for the high zinc requirement. (Phytate con- 545 tents of some feed ingredients are supplied by Gontzea and Sutzescu and 1132 Nelson et al. ) The incidence of zinc deficiency in Iranian villagers was attributed 1325 to high levels of phytate in the bread. To demonstrate the effect of phytate, high levels of phytate in the chemical form or tanok, an unleavened bread high in naturally occurring phytate, were fed to three men. Zinc excretion increased in two of the three men, but serum zinc levels were 1328 not consistently lowered. Prasad et al. reported that Iranian men whose diet consisted almost exclusively of bread and beans had low levels of zinc in their plasma, red blood cells, and hair, suggestive of zinc deficiency.1276 Incubating zinc-65-labeled high extraction wheat with yeast increased the 1329 solubility of zinc-65 in the wheat. Since phytate phosphorus decreased in yeast-wheat mixtures, part of the increased availability was probably from hydrolysis of phytate. How- ever, the difference in solubility of zinc-65 was much greater than could be accounted for by phytate destruction alone. There are also enzymes in 122,361a,1778 the animal intestine that degrade phytate, but they have not been studied extensively. Adding phytate to animal proteins decreased the availability of their zinc to chicks; the effect was aggravated in the presence of high 1155 levels of dietary calcium. Assay of zinc availability in plant food 1156 ranged from 40-60%, quite a high availability compared to that of other minerals. Zinc in zinc-65-labeled pea seeds was 75% available even in 1755 mature seeds with a 1.2% phytate content. Hencex factors other than phytate contribute to the appearance of zinc deficiency in animals on diets high in plant protein. The high fiber content of these diets may also con- tribute to reduced zinc availability since fecal zinc loss has been reported 1439 to be significantly correlated with fecal dry solids. The presence of phytate in the diet has not been considered a problem in ruminants because the microorganisms in the rumen can degrade 545,1050 phytate. The development of a zinc-responsive pododermatitis in 375 young bulls on a diet containing swede turnip and barley suggests that this conclusion should be reexamined, however, since the phytate content of 545 this ration could be relatively high. Weight gain of cattle on a soybean meal ration was improved by adding a combination of trace elements, including 288 zinc, to the ration. Calcium Calcium generally does not depress zinc absorption except in the 1155 presence of phytate. Addition of 7.7 g calcium lactate 278 image: ------- to the diet of 7-9-yr-old girls, for example, did not change the excretion 1298 of zinc, nor did a sixfold increase in the calcium intake (from 200 1532 to 1,300 rag) affect the zinc balance in adult men. Phytate reduced the rise in serum zinc in normal adults after zinc sulfate dosage, 1216a but calcium had no additional effect. However, some indication exists that high levels of calcium may affect zinc absorption when zinc levels in the diet are marginal. Rats given 1.3% calcium excreted more zinc-65 in the feces than did controls given 0.6% calcium. The effect appeared to be at the intestinal level, since the calcium level in the diet had no effect on retention or distribution of zinc-65 injected intra- 741 peritoneally. The high level of calcium (18%) in the clay ingested by 1510 some Iranians may also have contributed to zinc deficiency in this population. Because the source of much dietary calcium in this country is milk, it is interesting that oral administration of lactose and 500 zinc-65 increased the absorption and retention of zinc-65 in rats. A low calcium diet has been reported to reduce the severity of zinc deficiency in the pregnant rat, presumably by causing resorption of 762 bone and thereby releasing zinc from it. To support this theory, a low calcium diet was shown not to alleviate zinc deficiency in pregnant 1599 rats parathyroidectomized to prevent bone resorption. Pigs on a low zinc and low calcium diet showed no signs of zinc deficiency^ although those on a high calcium-low zinc diet were severely affected. Bone zinc was lower in pigs on the low calcium-low zinc diet, suggesting that either mobiliza- tion of zinc from the bone or failure to deposit zinc in the bone had occurred. In growing rats on a low calcium diet with a normal amount of zinc, bone zinc 464 increased. 279 image: ------- Protein and Amino Acids Net protein utilization of a soy diet by chicks was increased 57 slightly when zinc was increased from a marginal to an adequate level. Low levels of dietary protein in rats decreased both zinc absorption and 1671 levels of zinc in the liver and small intestine, implying that a secondary zinc deficiency might be induced in cases of protein malnutrition. Zinc absorption and retention by ruminants similarly was decreased on a low 1543 protein diet. In the ruminant, the effect was attributed to a lessened need for zinc because of reduced growth, but the lowered tissue zinc concen- trations found in the rats on the low protein diet suggests interference in zinc metabolism. Addition of 1% histidine or 0.2% histamine to low zinc diets alleviated leg abnormalities in chicks and skin lesions in pigs \u00b0 without affecting the zinc concentration of the tissues. Histidine did increase alkaline phosphatase in tibia of chicks QflS fed a low zinc-soy protein diet. UJ Feeding a histidine-rich protein to pigs also alleviated zinc deficiency although here absorption of zinc was increased. \u00b0 Adding arginine to chick diets low in zinc increased the severity of the leg abnormalities. Even with adequate zinc, added arginine tended to depress tibia zinc concentration, though not as markedly as with low levels of zinc. Since many seed proteins are high in arginine, arginine, as well as phytate, may cause problems when seed proteins are used in chick diets. 90^ The negative effects may be peculiar to chicks since their metabolism of arginine differs from that of mammals. Unlike the experimental animals, humans fed a diet rich in histidine became zinc-depleted . 673 280 image: ------- Vitamins Biotin has also been reported to alleviate somewhat 282 the symptoms of zinc deficiency in the rat. However, the observation was based on a small sample of rats. In a more extensive study, biotin levels from 2-50 rag/kg diet had no effect on weight gains or zinc levels in 1201 rats on a low zinc diet. Since folic acid concentration 1781 has been reported to be low in livers of zinc-deficient animals, these workers also studied the effect of adding 1-5 mg folic acid/kg diet. The additional folic acid produced no detectable effect. Similarly, additions of 2, 5, and 10 times the requirement for thiamine, niacin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, or vitamin B,^ failed to alleviate any of the symptoms of zinc deficiency. Low levels of vitamin A have been reported in 52,1413 zinc-deficient lambs and rats. -50ja\u00bbJ--'-1-' Retinol-binding protein 1514 was also lower in serum of zinc-deficient animals. Since vitamin A levels in the livers of zinc-deficient rats were higher than in ad libitum 1512 controls, it was concluded that zinc is required for normal mobiliza- tion of vitamin A from the liver. The accumulation of vitamin A in the liver of the deficient rat was related to the animal's lack of growth, however, because zinc-supplemented animals with growth restricted by limited food intake to the same rate of growth as the zinc-deficient animals also had high levels of vitamin A in the liver and low levels in serum. The low serum level in lambs may also have resulted from slow growth. Low levels of vitamin A 1356 in serum have been observed in protein-calorie malnutrition. 281 image: ------- Other Minerals Since cobalt can replace zinc in vitro in some zinc-dependent 929 enzymes, the possibility of substituting cobalt for some of the in vivo zinc requirement has been investigated. A preliminary report indicated 716 that this substitution was possible in pigs. In a more recent study with rats, cobalt reduced the zinc content of liver and serum but was ineffective in relieving any zinc deficiency symptoms. In the rat, cobalt cannot be substituted for the zinc required in the diet. Iron and nickel were simi- larly ineffective in relieving the zinc deficiency symptoms in rats but 848 did alter the concentrations of zinc in some tissues. Nor did Increasing 1194 the copper or manganese levels affect symptoms of zinc deficiency. 1102 Although cadmium normally is neglible in foods, a few studies 1236 have been done of zinc-cadmium interactions in the diet. Zinc or zinc 1047 plus copper in the diet protected against toxicosis from dietary cadmium. Distribution of injected cadmium was not different in weanling hamsters fed 1045a a low-zinc diet compared to those fed a stock ration. But the hamsters on the low-zinc diet were apparently not very zinc-deficient. Injecting cadmium on day 12 into pregnant rats caused more resorptions in females fed a low zinc (7 ppm) diet on days 4-12 than in those fed a high zinc (135 ppm) 1211a 448 diet. Cadmium decreased the intestinal uptake of zinc-65 in rats 1352 and calves, but in the deficient rats the transport of zinc to the carcass was not inhibited. Nor did copper inhibit zinc transport in zinc- deficient rats although it had some effect on rats with adequate zinc 448 / levels. Since more orally administered zinc-65 was excreted by copper- deficient rats than by controls, it has been hypothesized that copper 282 image: ------- 19 facilitates zinc absorption. The difference was small, however, and could have been caused by differences in growth or food consumption. There were no differences in zinc uptake and transfer by everted intesti- 1456 nal sacks of copper-deficient rats or the controls. However, binding 155a,156a,156b of copper and zinc by liver proteins has been shown to be related. Form of Zinc Absorption or retention of zinc was about the same in rats, cattle, and quail whether the intake was in the form of an inorganic salt or incor- 911,1122a,1128,1478 porated in a natural food. The anion associated with the 32 zinc does not affect utilization of zinc, although its solubility in the 155 alimentary tract of sheep varies with pH. Zinc sulfate has been reported to result in greater weight gains in pigs than did zinc oxide , but the data are not very convincing since the pigs supplemented with zinc sulfate did not grow any better than those supplemented with magnesium sulfate and no zinc. OCCURRENCE OF ZINC DEFICIENCY The extent to which zinc deficiency, particularly marginal zinc deficiency, occurs in man and animals outside the laboratory is largely unknown. The chief symptoms of zinc deficiency\u2014decreased food intake and cessation of growth\u2014are not, of course, unique to zinc deficiency. A test which will distinguish zinc deficiency from other deficiencies and is suitable for screening large populations of animals has yet to be developed. Because of the widespread presence of zinc in foodstuffs, zinc deficiency was long considered not to be a problem of any practical importance. 283 image: ------- Increased use of supplements such as soybean meal in animal diets, particu- larly for pigs and chickens, produced demonstrable zinc deficiencies despite supposedly adequate amounts of zinc in soybeans. Diets for these animals are 1049 now routinely supplemented with zinc. Only a few severe cases of 1050 apparent zinc deficiency in cattle have been reported, but unrecognized cases of mild deficiency may be extant, particularly in areas where the zinc content of forages is low. Crested wheat grass (Agropyron cristatum) in 125 northern Nevada was reported to have a content of 13 ppm zinc, less than that required by calves on a purified diet to maintain normal serum zinc levels. Zinc levels as low as 6 ppm have been found in some grasses (Kubota, unpublished data). Animals grazing on such grasses might well suffer from zinc deficiency. It is now known that zinc deficiency may occur in humans, particularly in people who derive much of their protein from plant sources. A recent 617 report of apparent zinc deficiency in middle-class American children indicates that the problem is more widespread than had been assumed. Forty- nine percent of children selected for short stature in a group of Project 1723 Head Start children had hair low in zinc. Similarly, about half the girls from low income families in another study had somewhat depressed zinc 1217 levels in their hair, although no correlation with growth seemed to exist.* Hair zinc was low in Iranian and Egyptian 2^8\u00bb1 hypogonadal patients with retarded growth. ASSESSING ZINC STATUS IN ANIMALS Because signs of a marginal zinc deficiency generally are nonspecific, some other test of zinc status is needed. Attempts to correlate zinc *See Burch et al.201a 284 image: ------- concentration in blood, hair, or urine with zinc status have met with limited success, as have endeavors to correlate zinc status with enzymes or metabolites in blood or urine. There have been recent attempts to correlate zinc status with taste acuity and salivary zinc levels. The problems involved in using these measures are discussed below. Plasma Zinc Although red blood cells contain significantly more zinc than do plasma or serum, zinc in the red blood cell appears to be firmly bound and shows little change in deficiency. Plasma or serum zinc is more variable and does reflect changes in the zinc status of the individual. Serum or plasma zinc in rats, for example, fell significantly after only 1-2 days on a deficient 1199,1773 diet, and it remained low throughout the period of low zinc intake. 199 This pattern was also true in humans. Low plasma zinc levels have been linked to poor growth and symptoms of zinc deficiency in cattle and sheep, although it was pointed out that at least two low serum zinc levels obtained on separate occasions would provide more conclusive evidence than a single 1064 determination. Unfortunately, many other conditions are responsible for reduced plasma zinc levels, including pregnancy, various diseases, and 614 stress. Food intake also affects serum zinc level. The plasma zinc levels ftfif) 82T of zinc-adequate quail and pigs and zinc-deficient chicks dropped when they were refed protein-containing diets after fasting. An oral protein 1235 supplement lowered serum zinc in healthy adults. Administration of zinc sulfate to fasting subjects increased serum zinc levels more than did 3,1216a administering zinc with a meal. Measurement of plasma zinc levels after oral dosing with zinc has been suggested as a better method for determining zinc deficiency than the usual measurement of plasma zinc, as rats on a zinc-deficient diet had higher levels of zinc in plasma after dosing with zinc than did 285 image: ------- 1774 those that had been on the control diet. The situation is consistent with the observation that everted jejuaal sacs (intesti- nal segments) from zinc-deficient rats took up more zinc than did those of 850,1456 fully fed controls. Other suggestions have been made that zinc 1048 absorption is increased in zinc deficiency, but the evidence is not con- clusive. Uptake by animals on restricted intake was also altered, however, suggesting that any animal receiving less than a normal food intake might also show a higher level of plasma zinc after dosing. Thus it is unlikely that determining plasma zinc levels after oral dosing offers any significant advantage. In summary, fairly severe zinc deficiency would be reflected in a low plasma zinc concentration, but marginal deficiencies are unlikely to be diagnosed by this index. For example, in cases of total starvation, plasma zinc levels were not lowered although body zinc stores were being 1532 depleted, indicated by excretion of zinc in the urine. Hair Zinc Because hair samples are easy to collect and store, their use for 504,614 estimates of zinc status has been looked into by several investigators. Various washing procedures were used to remove surface contamination, sweat, and body oil from the hair. One study of such procedures concluded that none of them satisfactorily overcame the effects of the cosmetic treatments 701 commonly used on human hair. With care, however, reliable estimates 1525 of zinc content of human hair probably can be obtained, although it may be wise to exclude samples subjected to the more severe treatments 286 image: ------- such as permanent waving, bleaching, and dyeing. Use of pubic hair has been suggested in cases where values from scalp hair might be unreliable because zinc concentrations in scalp and pubic hair of pregnant women have 89 been found to be the same. It is necessary to discern how useful the zinc content of the hair is in determining zinc status. The zinc content of hair is a reflection of chronic zinc status over the time the hair has been growing, because hair zinc does not exchange with the body zinc pool. Hence it is no surprise that no correlation was found between the zinc concentrations 999 in plasma and hair of Iranian village children. The lack of correlation between plasma and hair zinc was demonstrated more strikingly by an aero- dermatitis enteropathica patient whose plasma zinc levels were very low (less than 0.4 yg/ml), but whose hair zinc level was in the normal range. The normal hair zinc level may be related to the decreased hair growth in 1037a these patients. An extensive study of hair zinc in young rats on varied levels of zinc intake showed that a diet deficient enough to prevent weight gain also prevented hair growth, and therefore zinc concentration 1198 did not change substantially. A level of dietary zinc that was still suboptimal, yet which permitted some growth, resulted in increasing hair 1198 growth and reduced zinc concentration in the hair. Lack of correlation 855 between plasma and hair zinc was also reported in a Panamanian population, atif. although hair zinc in the females varied with geographic location. 617,1235b Zinc concentration in human hair is also reported to vary with age. Hair zinc content in female goats was suggested as a good indicator of zinc status because concentrations were decreased in animals on the deficient diet, but the concentration only was measured when the goats were 287 image: ------- 569 severely deficient. Zinc concentration was not correlated with the 1150 color of bovine hair in samples collected from field locations, but 39 3a it has been reported to vary with the season. Fairly severe zinc deficiencies in animals, particularly over a long period of time, would probably be reflected in a low hair zinc concen- tration. Marginal deficiencies are unlikely to be diagnosed in this manner 617 although a study of hair zinc in middle class American children indicated that the zinc level of hair might be a useful measure in detecting deficiency in humans. Urinary Zinc* Although zinc is largely excreted in the feces\u2014with only a small amount excreted in urine\u2014some indication exists that, at least in man, urinary zinc may be decreased in states of deficiency. Urinary zinc has not been measured extensively in animals, although urinary zinc excretion was studied in rats after EDTA administration to determine whether this 896 technique might be a way of assessing zinc stores. Such a procedure would be useful primarily for laboratory studies. Zinc Enzymes The existence in zinc-deficient animals of an inactive zinc-dependent enzyme that could be activated by the in vitro addition of zinc would provide an excellent assay for zinc deficiency. For example, a mutant of the bac- terium Escherichia coli grown in low zinc media produces an inactive form of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase, which can be activated if the enzyme is 602 incubated with zinc. The existence of this type of enzyme in blood would be obviously advantageous to diagnosis of zinc deficiency. Unfortunately, such an enzyme has not been found in animal tissues. *See also Chapters 7 and 10. 288 image: ------- Zinc-dependent enzymes in blood are of the most interest for their potential in assessing zinc status. Alkaline phosphatase is one of the enzymes that has been measured extensively in young, zinc-deficient animals. The enzyme appears to be consistently reduced in serum of zinc- 11,349,350,1146,1285 deficient pigs compared to controls, but in most cases the controls have grown more than the deficient animals. However, an instance of zinc deficiency in pigs was reported in which serum alkaline 201b phosphatase was not decreased. The results with rat serum have been 742,849,1370 more variable and not always different from controls on a restricted food intake, suggesting that decreased growth influenced the decreased activity. Since alkaline phosphatase in serum comes primarily 1765 from bone and liver, slight differences in growth rate may significantly affect the amount of the enzyme in serum. However, in a 22-yr-old aero- dermatitis enteropathica patient presumably not in an active stage of growth, the level of serum alkaline phosphatase rose parallel to the increase in serum zinc when zinc treatment was applied. Addition of zinc 1129a to serum in vitro did not increase the activity. Alkaline phosphatase was also low in serum of a boy who appeared to be zinc-deficient by other 615 1363 criteria, but not in Iranian boys with low plasma zinc levels. Calves with hereditary zinc deficiency were observed to have only slight alterations in alkaline phosphatase activity, although serum zinc levels decreased to 0.4 yg/ml. Symptoms of deficiency appeared 2-3 wk after the 881a serum zinc fell to that level. Since the activity of alkaline phosphatase can be altered by other conditions which interfere with normal metabolism of bone or liver and because low levels are usually found along with low 289 image: ------- levels of serum zinc, serum alkaline phosphatase is of no greater diagnos- tic value in determining possible zinc deficiency than the measurement of serum or plasma zinc level. 1370 Other zinc enzymes, such as lactic and malic dehydrogenase, have been measured in serum of zinc-deficient animals, but their enzymatic activity was not affected. Carbonic anhydrase activity was lower in deficient animals if the increase in numbers of erythrocytes from hemocon- 1374 centration in the deficient animals was taken into account. Since restricted-feed intake can also cause hemoconcentration, decreased activity was probably related to the reduced food consumption of the deficient 742 animals as was, in fact, found in another study. Therefore^no presently known enzyme is a reliable measure of zinc status. Metabolites Concentrations of various metabolites in blood and/or urine have been reported to be changed in zinc deficiency, but none of the changes appear to be observed consistently in deficient animals and are therefore of little value as a diagnostic tool. Metabolites that have been reported 1783 to appear in increased concentrations are uric acid in blood 730 729 731 733 and urine; hydroxyproline, sulfate, taurine, and alanine in and taurine and free fatty acids in plasma. Urinary ascorbic acid has been 93 reported as decreased. All these metabolites have been observed in young animals, and it is quite possible that they are nonspecific changes related to the slow rate of growth caused by the zinc deficiency. Reduced 290 image: ------- plasma protein in severely zinc-deficient rats was not related to decreased 1370,1598 growth or food intake; however, neither serum protein nor albumin levels were lowered along with the very low serum zinc level of patients 1129a with acrodermatitis enteropathica. Plasma protein would be affected by many conditions other than zinc deficiency. Taste Acuity and Salivary Zinc Because some conditions of abnormal taste acuity have been zinc- responsive, both taste acuity and salivary zinc have been measured in connection with studies of possible zinc deficiency. Taste acuity was 617 impaired in children with poor growth and low levels of hair zinc, but not in a young woman with acrodermatitis enteropathica, a zinc-responsive 1129a disease in which plasma zinc levels are very low. Zinc secretion in parotid saliva was lower in children who had low levels of hair zinc than 615 in normal children. The data are insufficient at present to indicate whether either of these measures is a reliable and specific indicator of zinc status. In any event, measurement of taste acuity would not be a practical means of screening large populations. Salivary zinc could be measured on animals as well as people. The large variation in zinc con- centration of saliva collected from the same individual at different 1536 times suggests that there may be substantial problems in the use of this criterion. Nonetheless, in view of the striking changes that have 973 79 been reported in the tongue of zinc-deficient sheep and monkeys, 1180 1146 in the mouth and esophagus of pigs, and in zinc-deficient 461,1102a 382 rats (including the fetal rat), measurement of salivary zinc may be worth pursuing. 291 image: ------- METABOLIC CONSEQUENCES OF ZINC DEFICIENCY Although many studies have examined in some detail the effects of zinc deficiency on various systems in the animal, the critical roles of zinc in these systems still are not known. Zinc is contained in a number of enzymes, but the effect of zinc deficiency on the activity of these enzymes is variable. Also, decreased activity of the known zinc-dependent enzymes seems not to be a major factor in the disturbances observed in zinc deficiency. Because some of the earliest effects of zinc deficiency are reduced food intake and cessation of growth, it is very difficult to distinguish between a primary effect of a lack of zinc on the animal and secondary effects based on decreased food consumption and halted growth. In theory, it is possible to control for the decreased food consump- tion by feeding a zinc-adequate animal the same amount of food that the zinc-deficient animal eats. The problem, however, is not so simple as it might appear, since the deficient animal has a cyclical pattern of 270,271,1782 eating, will gain weight less quickly than a zinc-adequate animal on the same amount of food, and will consume its food over a 24-h period, whereas the pair-fed animal consumes its food in a much shorter time.. To control for all these effects is difficult and often is not done. Since food intake can influence metabolism in ways and over time periods that are not obvious, differences between deficient animals and their \"controls\" must be interpreted very cautiously. DNA. RNA, AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS Because of the rapid effect of a lack of zinc on growth, a number of studies have been conducted on DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis during 292 image: ------- zinc deficiency. Concentrations of DNA, UNA, and protein were not remarkably 467,493,494,775,878,1172,1280,1284,1285 different in the deficient animal, but the concentration of these compounds may be less important than their meta- bolic activity. The activity of these compounds has been estimated by measuring the incorporation of radioactive precursors into DNA, KNA, or protein. In order for such measurements to be reliable, however, the radio- active precursor must have the same relative concentration in both deficient and adequate animals. Since concentrations of free amlno acids were higher 732 567 in both skin and plasma of deficient animals than in controls, and 729a since compounds such as thymldine and several amlno 733a,1607a acids were metabolized to carbon dioxide to a greater extent, the radioactive precursor may constitute a smaller proportion of the precursor pool in the deficient animal than it does in the control. Different concentrations of the radioactive precursor may be brought about by differences in enzymes needed to enable the radioactive compound to enter the precursor pool, as well as by differences in the concentration of metabolites in the cell. For example, incorporation of radioactive thymidine into the pool of DNA precursors in the cell depends on the activity of thymidine kinase, an enzyme whose activity has been shown to 722 351a vary diurnally, which is related somewhat to food consumption. The different eating pattern of the zinc-deficient animal therefore could make a difference in the time at which thymidine kinase activity occurs and consequently in the time at which peak Incorporation of thymidine would be observed. In rats on a low zinc diet, the peak of thymidine incorpora- tion which follows partial hepatectomy was delayed compared to the controls, but there was little difference in the amount of incorporation at the 293 image: ------- 397,408 respective peaks. Others have reported differences in thytnidine incor- poration between zinc-deficient animals and controls in which the magnitude 732,1002,1550 of the differences changed with time. Thymidine kinase activity, as measured by thymidine incorporation into DNA in vitro, was reduced in connective tissue from animals on a low zinc diet; the concentration of zinc used in the assay systems differed, however, and the animals on the low zinc 1280 diet also were receiving 2.5 times as much phytate as the controls. DNA Thymidine incorporation was reduced in liver, kidney, and spleen in young rats before growth and food consumption were affected by the low zinc 1779 diet. The sensitivity of these tissues to the early effects of the deficiency was no doubt related to the rapid turnover of zinc in these 920 tissues. Thymidine incorporation was also reduced in 12-day-old embryos of female rats given a deficient diet. However, mitoses in neuroepithelium 1584 were increased. In rapidly differentiating tissue such as embryonic tissue, tissues from animals fed a deficient diet may not be in the same stage of development as the controls although the time of gestation is the same. Different stages of development at the same time of gestation were observed between fetuses from folic acid-deficient females and fetuses 788a from controls. Thymidine incorporation was decreased in zinc-deficient rats more 736 than in controls after wounding the skin or implanting sponges under 1280 966 it, but not after an esophageal wound. Interpretation of studies of incorporation after surgery is complicated by the hormonal changes which accompany stress, since adrenal hormones, for example, affect thy- 542a midine incorporation. 294 image: ------- In contrast to reduced mltotic activity observed in most tissues 383,461,1180 of the zinc-deficient animal, mltotic activity in the esophagus and buccal mucosa was stimulated. The stimulation may be peculiar to 383,461 zinc deficiency because it did not occur in pair-fed controls. Furthermore, a single dose of zinc in zinc-deficient rats reduced cell division in the esophagus but increased the mitotic indices of epidermis 461 23 and liver. In addition to increased mitotic activity, thymidine incor- 24 1037 poration, and dry weight of cells in buccal mucosa of deficient rats, epithelial thickness was increased.1180 The increase in epithelial thickness occurred before the increase in mitotic activity and was thought to come from interference with the normal shedding mechanism, perhaps from an increased glycoprotein coating of keratinizing cells. Apparent interference with the shedding mechanism was also observed in esophagi from 18-day-old rats nursed by zinc-deficient dams and in pigs on a low zinc-high calcium diet. Alterations in salivary and intestinal mucus have been reported in zinc- . -. . t fc 1309 deficient rats. Cell cultures also are affected by a lack of zinc. Results in these systems are clearer, because differences from food intake and hormonal changes are eliminated. Addition of a zinc chelating agent inhibited 931a,931b incorporation of thymidine into DNA in primary rabbit kidney cells, 1785 269 1377,1378,1379 in human and porcine lymphocytes, and in chick embryo cells. However, the zinc.requirement was lost rapidly by rabbit cells, and continu- ously cultivated cells such as HeLa cells and L cells were also resistant 931a to EDTA. Chick embryo cells retained the requirement for zinc but 1377 became quite resistant to EDTA after infection with Rous sarcoma virus. 295 image: ------- The effect of EDTA did not appear to be caused by damage to the cell membrane 1379 since cell movement and uptake of glucose were normal. 1494,1542 59,59a, Although good evidence exists that both DNA- and RNA- 59b,1255 dependent DNA polymerases from some organisms are zinc-dependent enzymes, EDTA probably does not affect enzymes directly involved in DNA syn- thesis. A delay in the addition of EDTA decreased its effect in several 268,269,515,931a,931b systems, and in continuously replicating cells EDTA 1377 was able to reduce thymidine incorporation only after a time lag. Both these results are interpreted to mean that zinc is required for a critical step preceding the onset of DNA synthesis in the cell, and that cells past 268,931b,1377 this step when EDTA is added will replicate normally. Studies of microorganisms grown in low-zinc media are also consistent with this hypothesis. Although growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis was inhibited by a low-zinc medium, the activity of DNA polymerase in vitro was 201a not affected. As has been pointed out, an enzyme which is zinc-dependent in one species need not be so in another; however, the activity of the poly- merase from Mycobacterium smegmatis was inhibited by a 1790 and was presumably a zinc-requiring enzyme. Euglena gracilis also 452 appeared to synthesize DNA normally, but it failed to divide. The DNA synthesized could, of course, have been abnormal. In the zinc-deficient Mycobacterium smegmatis, increased DNAase activity was suggested to be related to increased need for DNA-repairing enzymes to compensate for synthesis of abnormal DNA. DNA synthesis was not affected in Rhodotorula 292 gracilis. In summary, the increased mitotic activity in esophagus, buccal mucosa, wounded skin, and liver after partial hepatectomy, as well as the 296 image: ------- synthesis of connective tissue in response to an irritant, provide ample evidence that zinc-deficient animals can synthesize DNA. The lack of growth in zinc-deficient animals seems to be due to an effect on factors initiating DNA synthesis rather than to any defect in the process once it has begun. RNA In general, incorporation of precursors into RNA is less affected by a lack of zinc than is incorporation of precursors into DNA. Levels of EDTA that almost completely inhibited thymidine incorporation into DNA had little effect on incorporation of precursors into RNA in rabbit kidney 931a,931b 1785 268,269 cells, human, or porcine lymphocytes, and perfused 515 liver. EDTA reduced the incorporation of precursors into RNA in chick embryo cells to 60% of normal, whereas incorporation of thymidine into DNA 1377 was almost completely inhibited. Incorporation of uridine 11 79 into brains of both zinc-deficient rats and controls was identical. ' Synthesis of RNA was not affected in Mycobacterium smegmatis grown in a medium 635a 292 low in zinc, but it was decreased in Rhodotorula gracilis and 452 Euglena gracilis. 1462 RNA polymerase has been reported to contain zinc, but its activity was less inhibited by EDTA the later the EDTA was added to the incubation mixture. This phenomenan has been interpreted to mean that zinc is required for the initiation of RNA chains but not for their elongation. Because the enzyme does contain zinc, its activity has been measured in zinc-deficient 1603 493 animals. Its activity was reduced in liver and brain from rat pups nursed by zinc-deficient dams. However, the pups continued to grow despite 1603 the reduced polymerase in the liver; and the activity in brain, although 493 reduced at 6 days, was no longer reduced at 16 days. RNA polymerase 122a,1345b activity in rat liver nuclei was also affected by starvation, 297 image: ------- but the relation between RNA synthesis in the animal and the measurement of RNA polymerase in the test tube is not clear. Zinc stimulated orotate incorporation in vivo without any detectable effect on RNA polymerase activity 1757 1757,1757a measured in vitro. Zinc inhibited polymerase activity in vitro. The increase in material in the monosome region of the sedimentation profiles 493 122b 1144a of zinc-deficient rat pups, starved pigeons, and mice could repre- sent defective RNA synthesis, but it may simply reflect the decreased protein synthesis that is apt to follow decreased growth. Neither additional poly- 1345b 122b merase nor initiation factors increased RNA synthesis in preparations from starved animals, further suggesting that reduced polymerase activity was the result rather than the cause of decreased growth. RNAase activity was increased in testes of rats that had been on a 1284 1522a deficient diet for 5 or 11 wk. Since the testes of growing rats are particularly susceptible to zinc deficiency, increased RNAase activity at these relatively late stages of the deficiency may also have been a result rather than a cause of the problem. RNAase activity was not different in brains of rats nursed by females on a low zinc diet, although, brain growth 494 itself was reduced. Protein Synthesis Nor did EDTA have much effect on incorporation of labeled amino acids 931a 1377 into protein in rabbit kidney cells, chick embryo cells, and perfused 515 rat liver. Since EDTA only affected amino acid incorporation into protein 269,1785 in lymphocytes at later stages of the cell cycle (but not initially), EDTA presumably did not affect protein synthesis per se. A zinc-deficient diet also had little effect on incorporation of labeled amino acids into 408,1172 533,731,735 protein in young rats. Incorporation of several amino acids, 298 image: ------- 1003 including selenium analogs, was decreased in skin from deficient rats but not in other tissues. Incorporation of radioactive amino acids into liver, heart, and kidney was reduced in rat pups nursed by females on a low zinc 496 diet. Aside from the differences in incorporation in skin and in nursing 533 pups (perhaps partly caused by differences in amino acid metabolism by the deficient animals), little indication has been found that a zinc-deficient diet interferes with protein synthesis. The deficient rat was able to syn- thesize new tissue in response to an irritant; and although the total amount synthesized was less than that of controls, the amount synthesized relative to weight gain was as high in the deficient animal as in the ad libitum 467,1284 control. Deficient rats also synthesized protein in response to 1218 267a infection and after partial hepatectomy. INTERMEDIARY METABOLISM Glucose Because the concentration of zinc in the pancreas decreases markedly when zinc is deficient, and because the addition of zinc to insulin prepara- tions prolongs their action, several studies have been made on the effect of zinc deficiency on glucose tolerance. Results have conflicted, somewhat accounted for in that glucose tolerance in rats appears to be closely related to the food consumption of the animals in the 24 h preceding 479 the pretrial fast. In studies where differences in glucose tolerance 139,740 existed, comparisons were apparently made to ad libitum-fed controls. 139,1309a Differences in glucose levels in fasted animals, glucose toler- 663,1221,1308 139,740 139,1221, ance, insulin levels in blood before and during 1308,1309a 740,1221 glucose stimulation, and insulin levels in the pancreas 299 image: ------- between deficient animals and pair-fed controls generally have been small. Blood glucose was higher in deficient animals that were given a second dose 663,1309a of glucose within 2 h after the first dose. Pancreatic tissue from deficient animals released less insulin in vitro in response to glucose stimulation than did tissue from ad libitum-fed controls but the effect was 740 obtained only at a high glucose level. Insulin secretion in response to 659a glucose stimulation is also affected by starvation. Resistance to 1309a insulin coma was greater in zinc-deficient rats, but resistance to 1594a insulin coma is also affected by starvation. Fatty Acid High levels of free fatty acid were observed in fasted rats during 1308 the first 3-4 wk after they were placed on a zinc-deficient diet. How- ever, values approached those of the control group with time. Zinc stimulated 130 7b the glucose uptake by rat adipose tissue in vitro, although the magnitude 1307c of the effect varied with the species of rat. Glucose uptake by adipose tissue from zinc-deficient rats was less than that from rats given a zinc 130 7b supplement. Amino Acid Amino acid metabolism, particularly that of the sulfur-containing amino acids, has been reported to be disturbed in zinc deficiency. Urinary excretion of both total sulfur and sulfate from sulfur-labeled methionine, 733 42 733 cystine, and taurine, as well as sodium sulfate was increased in deficient rats. The urinary excretion of taurine increased in one investigation*2 but not in another.567 Hydroxyproline excretion also increased in young zinc-deficient 300 image: ------- 729 rats. Levels of free amino acids in rat skin were increased in deficient 732 animals. Activities of the amino acid-catabolizing enzymes arginase and tryptophan pyrrolase were also increased, although the activities of serine 730 and threonine dehydratases were not affected. In these experiments, the weight of the pair-fed animals exceeded that of the zinc-deficient ones. Therefore, the differences observed may have been due to differences in growth rate of the two groups of animals. Both food restriction and zinc 156,364,1342 deficiency affect zinc-binding proteins in rat liver. ZINC DEFICIENCY AND BONE FORMATION Bone abnormalities in zinc-deficient chicks and rat embryos have led to studies on the effects of zinc deficiency on calcium metabolism and bone 99,100,102,221,755,949,951,1139,1146,1760 growth. Kinetic studies of calcium- 45 in zinc-deficient rats showed that turnover of calcium was slower in deficient than in pair-fed animals and that pool size was smaller. Absorption 755 and excretion were not different, however. Sulfate uptake and turnover in 1139 growing regions of bone were impaired in the zinc-deficient chick. In vitro sulfate uptake by skin from pigs given a moderately low zinc diet was 1610 not impaired. There was no difference in collagen or mucopolysaccharides of zinc-deficient chicks, although the hexosamine content of primary spongiosa 1139 was somewhat higher. Hexosamine content in bone from deficient rats was 949 not different from the controls, although hexosamines in saliva were 1309 affected. No change occurred in the hexosamine content of skin from 1610 pigs given a moderately low zinc diet. Many changes that were observed 99,102,949,1146 in bone from deficient animals were similar to those observed 301 image: ------- with decreased feed intake. Zinc and manganese appeared to interact in 1306a otolith formation in mice. Zinc deficiency in chicks causes a swollen hock condition which resembles arthritis. Certain anti-arthritic compounds relieved the con- 715 1323 dition while others did not. How the effective antidotes acted was unclear, although in some cases sulfate uptake in areas of bone growth increased. However, sulfate uptake increased in adequate as well as 395 deficient chicks. Increased dietary histidine also relieved the swollen hock condition and was postulated to function by increasing histamine concentration, but his- tamine in tissues of deficient chicks was not different from controls, nor 1324 was it increased by the feeding of histidine. Histidine did increase 904,905 alkaline phosphatase activity measured in the entire tibia, although histolbgic studies did not show any difference in the distribution of alka- 1760 line phosphatase in the epiphyseal plate. Some changes in bone histology 1760 were apparent before alkaline phosphatase would be produced, so that deranged alkaline phosphatase may be a symptom rather than a cause of problems in bone formation. ZINC DEFICIENCY AND ZINC-RELATED ENZYMES As with the DNA polymerases, the demonstration of a zinc-requirement by an enzyme in an organism has led to its measurement in zinc-deficient animals, although the enzyme tn the animal may not have been shown to be zinc-dependent. Again, it must be emphasized that the metal requirement for the same enzyme in different species need not be the same. A comparison of 302 image: ------- activities of various enzymes in zinc-deficient animals in relation to the controls is given in Tables 8-4 and 8-5. The tables only are intended to indicate whether a difference was observed between the activity of the enzymes in the tissues of zinc-deficient animals and those of controls; and, if values were given for both pair-fed and ad libitum controls, whether the enzymatic activity in the tissues from the pair-fed animal varied in the same direction as that of the deficient one. If a change is shown in the deficient animal without a notation of change in the pair-fed control, it may mean that information on pair-fed controls was not given. Also, increased enzymatic activity in the pair-fed control relative to the activity in the ad libitum will not be reflected in the tables unless the enzyme activity was increased in the deficient animal. It should also be pointed out that different authors expressed their results differently. Ratings in the table were based on activity/ unit weight rather than on total activity, since the total would obviously be influenced by the smaller size of the tissues in the deficient animals. Nonetheless, activity/unit DNA was significantly different in some tissues 1285 in one study, whereas activity/unit protein was not. Also, in one of the studies, pair-fed controls were not used because in a previous study 775 they had become \"zinc-deficient.\" It seems more likely that the animals were biotin-deficient, as diets containing egg white increase the requirement for biotin. Since egg white protein is widely used in studies of zinc deficiency because of its low zinc content, increased biotin require- ment should be taken into consideration although most investigators do add an excess of biotin to such diets. 303 image: ------- As shown in Table 8-4, the activities of presumably zinc-related enzymes in the deficient animal have varied from tissue to tissue and from experiment to experiment. In Table 8-5 it can be seen that other enzymes not known as zinc-dependent enzymes were also altered in the zinc-deficient animal. Alkaline phosphatase in bone was consistently lowered in the zinc-deficient animal, as was alcohol dehydrogenase in liver and carboxypeptidase in the pancreas. The volume of pancreatic secretion was 1565 also smaller in zinc-deficient pigs. The decrease in a-mannosidase in useful as serum may be/ an indicator of zinc status because the activity of the enzyme in liver was reported to decrease in zinc-deficient rats and be activated by zinc in vitro, whereas the activity of the liver enzyme from zinc-adequate 1213a rats was only slightly stimulated. As mentioned, this type of effect would make a useful assay of zinc deficiency. Little correlation has been found between zinc concentration in tissues and the activity of the presumed zinc-dependent enzymes. Concen- tration of zinc in the liver was not lowered in the deficient animal in two 1279,1372 of the studies, whereas liver alcohol dehydrogenase was lowered. The activity of alcohol dehydrogenase correlated well with the concentration of zinc if food were restricted but not if animals were fed 1330 normally. Because enzymatic activity is not correlated with zinc in the tissues and most enzymes are not activated by zinc in in vitro assays, it is possible that enzymatic activity is low in the zinc-deficient animal because the animal has stopped growing and consequently needs less enzyme. In any 304 image: ------- event, of the few enzyme activities that have been consistently lowered, none seem likely to account for the symptoms (see Table 8-1) observed in the deficient animal. Alkaline phosphatase has been one of the most extensively studied enzymes in zinc-deficient animals. Determination of alkaline phosphatase activity in animals is complicated by the fact that enzymes from different 783a tissues varied in pH optima, activity with different substrates, and 361a,361b,783a,948a activity in presence of magnesium. Within a single tissue several isoenzymes may exist,; as many as five have been reported in 36 la intestinal mucosa. Only one isoenzyme\u2014with a pH optimum at 10.5\u2014'was 783a,1326a activated by adding zinc in vitro, although intestinal homogenates 1778 have not been activated by in vitro addition of zinc. In cases where alkaline phosphatase was activated, it happened to the control as well as the deficient enzyme. Chromatography of homogenates from deficient and control animals indicated that the same isoenzymes were present in both animals. although some properties of the enzyme from the deficient animal 1326a differed from those found in the control. The apparent differences, however, may have been a consequence of differences in degree of purifica- tion of the preparations. ZINC AND REPRODUCTION Another major effect of zinc deficiency is its interference with the growth or function of the reproductive organs. This is another area in which it is extremely difficult to distinguish between the effect of a lack of zinc per se and the effect of reduced food intake. Underfeeding is well 907a known to interfere with reproductive function. 305 image: ------- Female 220,327, In the rat, inadequate zinc severely affects reproduction. 759,761,1582,1640,1732 Effects include difficult parturition, congenitally malformed young, failure to maintain pregnancy, and cessation of estrous cycles. Congenital malformation or difficult parturition occurred after consuming a 46,756,1731 1582 low zinc diet or large amounts of a zinc chelate for just a few days during a critical period of gestation. Development of preimplanta- tion eggs was abnormal in females fed a deficient diet for only the first 758 few days of pregnancy; however, offspring born after dams received a deficient 756 diet for days zero to five had only a slight incidence of malformations. Work with the teratogenic effects of trypan blue also suggest that there is some mechanism for repairing early damage to the 621b eggs. Administration of zinc late in pregnancy prevented stress at parturi- 47 tion, but survival of offspring from dams fed a zinc-deficient diet during the second week of gestation was poor although zinc nutriture after that was 757 adequate. Survival of pigs born to gilts on a low zinc diet for approxi- 1744a mately the last third of pregnancy was also poor, and abnormalities in 1202 bone development were observed in the fetuses. Feeding the rat a zinc- 1102a deficient diet during lactation caused severe zinc deficiency in the pups. Insufficient zinc during pregnancy also interferes with reproduction 44 in the rabbit. Studies of zinc metabolism in zinc-adequate rabbits have shown that zinc accumulation in the rabbit endometrium coincided with the 958a blastocyst phase of embryonic development. About that time, luteal tissue also showed a marked increase in specific activity of injected zinc-65, 306 image: ------- lOlla although the zinc concentration in the tissue did not change. Turn- over of zinc-65 in the endometrium decreased in the pregnant, pseudopregnant, and superovulated rabbit. In placental tissues, zinc transport varied with gestational age, and fetal placenta exchanged zinc with blood plasma four times 1011 757 1202 faster than maternal placenta. Fetal plasma in rats, pigs* and 929a sheep and goats is higher in zinc concentration than maternal plasma. The concentration of zinc in human amniotic fluid at the end of pregnancy 453a has been correlated with the birth weight of the newborn. Zinc in vitro has been shown to potentiate contractile responses of 354b rat uteri to submaximal doses of acetylcholine. Since uterine contractions have not been measured in the zinc-deficient preg- nant animal, it is not known whether there is anything abnormal about the contractions that could be related to the difficulty at parturition. Zinc concentration in the deficient uterus was the same as in the controls. But such a condition does not indicate of itself that contractility was normal since the potentiation in vitro did not correlate with the zinc content of 354b the uterus. Adding zinc to an endometrial homogenate has been reported 43 5a to increase binding of g-estradiol to protein. Most studies dealing with the relation of zinc to reproduction in the female have been done with animals that bear large litters, such as the rat, rabbit, and pig. Whether the work with these animals applies to other species, particularly those that bear single offspring during relatively long gestation times, is unknown. For animals that do not have large litters, zinc may be more important for normal mating and maintenance of pregnancy than for normal delivery. 307 image: ------- After consuming a low zinc diet for 2-3 wk before mating, rats failed 45 to maintain pregnancy. Consumption of a low zinc diet for longer periods 45,544 brought about cessation of estrous cycling. The effects on the estrous cycle in particular are probably caused by reduced food consumption although measurements of reproductive hormones indicated that effects of zinc deficiency 544 and restricted food intake were not identical. 614 1000 Oral contraceptives lower plasma zinc levels in humans and rats. The percentage of zinc-65 in other tissues of rats given high levels of estro- gen was increased somewhat; however, the dose administered signficantly depressed weight gains in the growing females. Male The relation of zinc to the male reproductive function has received considerable attention because of the high concentration of zinc present in 1640 the prostate gland and semen. The major portion of the zinc in semen comes from the prostate gland, but its function is not known. Zinc content 1376b of the epididymis is also high and may function in retarding oxidation 224 of sulfhydryl groups in the sperm. But sperm motility is not 789a affected by large differences in zinc content, although sulfhydryl 224 groups in sperm flagellum have been thought to be involved in motility. Zinc also has been postulated to protect the integrity of sperm since 42 7a oxygen consumption by sperm in vitro was raised in the absence of zinc. Increased oxygen consumption by sperm is associated with metabolic disorganiza- tion. Zinc uptake by sperm was affected by factors other than the concentra- tion of zinc in semen. a' ' c Interference with normal zinc metabolism was postulated to be a mechanism of the antifertility agent a-chlorohydrin since it increased radioactive zinc in regions of the 308 image: ------- 575a testes in which zinc concentration in sperm is normally reduced. Repro- ductive hormones have also been shown to alter the distribution of zinc in 1640 male reproductive organs. Insufficient zinc in growing male rats severely affected testicular Development. The effect was apparently independent of the low food intake since pair-weight rats had normal size testes whereas those of deficient rats 383 were considerably smaller than normal. Histologic studies of a few zinc- deficient rats suggested that the earliest effect of zinc deficiency on the testes was the inhibition of the transformation of round spermatids into 1174 elongated ones. Refceding the animals with zinc for 15 days subsequent 383 to the 28-day depletion period restored the histologic appearance to normal. However, low food intake does affect the testes in some ways. Alpha\" mannosidase activity, for example, has been reported to decrease in epididy- mal tissue of zinc-deficient rats. But enzymatic activity was restored in castrated animals by injecting them with testosterone, yet zinc 1517a concentration was not affected. The enzyme may have been affected by the decreased testosterone levels associated with low feed intake. Libido of adult male goats on a zinc-deficient diet has been reported 1127 to be reduced, but the goats may not have had a simple zinc deficiency. EFFECT OF ZINC ON FOOD INTAKE For both animals and man, one of the first effects of a low zinc diet is decreased food consumption. In rats, food consumption also became increasingly variable and cyclic.270'1782 Intake varied less if the rats were given a 5% rather than a 20% protein diet. Moreover, zinc-depleted rats ate more of a zinc-supplemented diet only when it contained protein.270 Examination of the amino acid pattern 309 image: ------- in plasma and urine of animals fed low zinc diets containing either 24% or 6% protein indicated that plasma amino acids\u2014particularly nonessential ones\u2014were elevated on the low zinc diets. Tyrosine was the only amino acid that fluctuated significantly in relation to daily food intake. Animals on a low protein diet may not be functionally zinc- deficient, because growth is restricted by the lack of protein and the increased catabolism of body protein may release enough zinc to satisfy temporary maintenance requirements. Mean plasma zinc concentrations of rats on a low protein diet were appreciably higher than in those fed 20% protein diets.1376a Zinc-deficient rats drank more of an acetic acid solution if they pre- 276 viously had received zinc in the solution. Zinc-deficient rats also drank more sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, and quinine sulfate solutions than did pair-fed controls, and took in a greater total volume of fluid, including tastant 1004 solutions and water. Zinc-depleted chicks also chose a zinc-supplemented diet in preference to a low zinc diet, after 5 days, however, the controls also selected the supplemented diet. Turkey poults have been reported to select a zinc-supplemented diet, \"a but apparently because of a position preference. Food consumption rose within a few hours after zinc repletion 11 QS in young zinc-deficient rats, but it increased more slowly in zinc- deficient pregnant rats who were transferred to a zinc-adequate diet. EFFECTS OF ZINC DEFICIENCY ON WOUND HEALING AND TUMOR GROWTH IN ANIMALS Reports of beneficial effects of zinc on wound healing in man have led to studies of wound healing in both zinc-deficient and zinc-adequate animals. Wound healing was impaired in zinc-deficient animals; *' differences were more apt to occur during later stages of healing.1264 -jhe level of zinc in wound fluid and wound plasma has been reported to increase 310 image: ------- 930 931 in rats and dogs in early stages after wounding. However, the increases observed were highly variable, as were the effects of different stresses on 1745 427,571, serum zinc in dairy cows. Additional zinc generally has no effect 1307,1408 902,1034,1082 or only slight effect on wound healing in zinc-adequate animals. Zinc sulfate did not improve collagen biosynthesis or fibroblast 1737b proliferation in human tissue culture. Zinc seemed to have some protective effect on the livers of rats injected with carbon tetrachloride427 and on the thyroid glands of pigs given methylthiouracil, a thyroid 685 antagonist. The effectiveness of zinc in stimulating lymphocyte transfor- 98,1243 1307a mation and increasing thymus weight suggests that excess zinc might stimulate the immune system; but except for the effects mentioned, beneficial effects of zinc treatments on zinc-adequate animals have not been demonstrated. Zinc deficiency has been reported to decrease the growth rate of several tumors and increase the survival times of animals inoculated with them. If Walker 256 carcinosarcoma (a rapidly dividing solid tumor) were injected intramuscularly in young male rats that had been on a zinc-deficient diet for 8 days, the number of takes was reduced; survival time was increased and 381 tumor size reduced in those animals in which tumors did grow compared to 1018 381 either pair-fed or paired-weight controls. Growth of a variant of the Walker 256 carcinosarcoma was reduced in young rats that had been on a 1235a low zinc diet since weaning. Similar results occurred in mice with the 380 slower growing Lewis lung carcinoma. Survival times after injection with various leukemia tumors were not as markedly affected by zinc deficiency as 81,380 sarcoma tumors and attempts to increase the effectiveness of the zinc 81 deficiency in treating leukemia tumors were unsuccessful. 311 image: ------- It is important to realize that in the cases in which tumor growth was reduced in zinc deficiency, the animals were already deficient when the tumor tissue was injected. Transferring animals to a low zinc diet after a tumor is established has not been shown to reduce tumor growth. Because of the hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis of the esophagus that occur in zinc-deficient animals, a relationship between esophageal cancer and zinc deficiency had been postulated. A marginal intake (7 ppm) of zinc did not, however, affect the incidence of nitrosamine-induced 1683 esophageal carcinogenesis in rats. ZINC DEFICIENCY AND BEHAVIOR Zinc-deficient rats have performed poorly on different behavioral 220,601,950,1406 tests. Exploratory activity was decreased and performance 219 impaired in rats given a deficient diet for 7 wk after weaning. However, the rats were apparently ill at the time of testing. Behavior was also affected in offspring of rats given a deficient diet during gestation or lactation although the offspring themselves were given a zinc-adequate diet. Offspring from two rats given a deficient diet during lactation made 950 more errors on an elevated maze than did offspring from two pair-fed rats. Offspring from successive litters of females fed a deficient diet through- out gestation and lactation were less active in an open field test than were controls. The number of deficient rats tested, however, was very small and represented few litters, since not many offspring from the deficient 220 females survived to weaning. Male offspring of 5 dams on a deficient diet only during days 15-20 of gestation avoided shock less successfully than did offspring from 5 pair-fed 312 image: ------- rats. Offspring from both deficient and pair-fed animals, however, were less active and extinguished the response faster than did offspring from ad libitum 601,1406 females. Since female offspring of zinc-deficient dams tolerated 600 shock less well than did those from pair-fed animals, poorer performance of the males in the shock avoidance test also may have been due to a reduced tolerance for shock. Females from pair-fed dams were less resistant to shock than were those from ad libitum females. These studies suggest that consumption of a zinc-deficient diet during pregnancy or lactation has a residual effect on the offspring. Such an effect 737 has also been attributed to protein deficiency during gestation^ but the number of pregnant females used in the zinc studies was small. In addition, the effect of zinc may have resulted from differences in the care given the 46 pup by the dam, the suckling ability of the pup and hence its ability to 1816a stimulate lactation, or the in utero nutrition of the fetus,although the dams received the same amount of food. Whatever the source of the difference, one must be very cautious in extrapolating these results to other species since the brain of the rat is relatively immature at birth and may be more susceptible to nutritional insults. Brain maturation, as measured by the activity of the myelln- associated enzyme, 2', 3'-cyclic rats suckling females on a zinc-deficient diet. Studies of DNA, RNA, and protein in brains of animals whose mothers were subjected to gestational or lactational zinc deficiencies have revealed 493,494 relatively little difference in the concentration of these compounds. 313 image: ------- TABLE 8-U Effects of Zinc Deficiency on Tinaue Levels of ZIne-Relnted Enzyiron Eeryma Blood Alcohol Decrease Decrease Bo change Bo change ; Bo change Decrease* Bo change Bo change Bo change* Decrease* Bo o>nannosldase Increase* Bo change Bo change Decrease D8crea.e Bo change a(pl\u00ab) Decrease*1 Ho change Decrease* Bo change* change change\" change1 Decrease TABLE 8-4 (Cont'd.)

A fairly constant supply of zinc is required by all species. Signs of zinc deficiency develop rather quickly when zinc intake is low because very little zinc is stored in the body in a readily available form. Although a relatively large amount of zinc is stored in skin, muscle, and bone, this zinc is not available to the animal unless those tissues are being catabolized. 2. The extent to which marginal zinc deficiency occurs in humans and animals is unknown. Without a specific test for zinc deficiency, it is difficult to determine a marginal occurrence of it. The high protein diet typical of middle and upper income Americans will probably supply close to the 15 mg zinc that is the RDA for adults. Therefore, deficiencies would not be expected in these individuals. However,.people eating low protein diets are apt to receive significantly less zinc. To what extent marginal zinc deficiency may occur under these conditions is at present unknown. It is important to realize that the RDA and nutrient requirements of animals are simply the best estimates that can be made with the limited amount of data available. They will undoubtedly be modified as more is known about the-factors affecting zinc requirements and zinc availability. 3. The aspects of cellular metabolism that are primarily affected by zinc deficiency are not known. Although zinc is contained in a number of enzymes, the effect of zinc deficiency on enzymatic activity is varied, and decreased activity of known zinc-dependent enzymes does not seem to be a major factor in disturbances observed in zinc deficiency. Many of the effects observed may be a function of low food intake or lack of growth. 318 image: ------- 4. The amount of zinc occurring naturally in food is unlikely to be a health hazard. Ingested zinc is relatively nontoxic if the diet contains adequate copper and iron; most animals appear to tolerate levels of the order of a milligram per gram. Because of the possible interference with copper and iron metabolism, animals with high zinc intakes should be monitored for signs of anemia. 319 image: ------- CHAPTER 9 ZINC IN METALLOPRDOEENS SPECIFIC ZINC ENZYMES The study of the specific biologic role of zinc has centered on its function in a number of zinc metalloenzymes. Several of their structures are now known on a molecular level; moreover, the three-dimen- sional structure as determined by X-ray diffraction has allowed sane precise descriptions of the role of zinc in the mechanisms of enzymatic action. The characteristics of the zinc metalloenzymes which have been well documented and the reactions catalyzed are listed in Table 9-1. Table 9-2 lists zinc- containing enzymes for which extensive studies on the function of zinc have not been carried out. Some enzymes, such as DNA and KNA polymerase, have been reported to contain zinc when isolated, but the metal's particular functional role in these enzymes has not been delineated. The carboxypeptidases (part of the exocrine secretion of the pancreas) are important in the C-terminal hydrolyses of peptides and proteins in the mammalian gut. Additional proteases from bacteria have been discovered to be zinc metalloenzymes. The most thoroughly studied example is thermolysin, found in an extremely heat-stable enzyme containing both calcium and zinc.990 The Ca(II) appears to participate in the heat stability rather than in the activity, whereas Zn(II) is essential to activity and appears to function much as the Zn(II) ion in carboxypeptidase A. The specificity of thermolysin is analo- gous to that of the latter enzyme, except that it is an endopeptidase and does not require the terminal free-carboxyl on the substrate. The neutral protease from Bacillus subtilis has been less extensively studied, but it is i known that Zn(II) is essential for activity. 320 image: ------- Molecular per b Weight Molecule Reaction Catalyzed- Reference W f\\ H T B 1 T 34,500 1 J2>-C-N-CH2-C or Lys O H 6 catalytic 6 regulatory Molecular Weight 80,000 80,000 80,000 32,000 300,000 subunits 33,000 subunits 17,000 Zinc per Molecule Reaction Catalyzed- 2 ROPO 4- HO ^ ' '\"* ROH 4- HPO \" 3 2 * 4 RSP03 4- H20 ;ps\u00b1 RSH 4- 2; Cu 0~ 0~ 4- 2K+SgHH 00 ^22 2 6 H2N-C-O'*'P 4- Asp^Carbanyl-Asp + HPO^ Reference 1322 Reid and Wilson Horecker et al. 833 Keleti 508 Fridovich hydrolyzed -Hippurylphenyllactic acid image: ------- TABLE 9-2 Enzymes Reported to Contain Zinc Enzyme RNA polyroerase RNA. polymerase DMA polymerase Rat liver Escherichia coli coli Yeast Yeast Jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) Bacillus cereus Snake venom Rat muscle Clostridium histolyticum Bacillus cereus Porcine kidney Bacillus cereus Molecular Weight 370,000 110,000 109,000 52,000 450,000 26,000 290,000 105,000 47,000 Zinc Atoms per Molecule Oof actor 2 2-4 2 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1? 2 Ca 2 0 0 1 Reference 1462 Scrutton et al.

Carbonic anhydrase may also influence the eg|li1^hrium in the leaves of green plants. Aside from carbon dioxide transport itself, it is possible that catalysis of the CO^sft HCO~ equilibrium by carbonic anhydrase is involved in the general scheme of anion transport and the maintenance of electroneutrality. Alkaline phosphatase is widely distributed in nature. It is present in bacterial cells like Escherichia coli (where it is located in the peri- plastic space between cell wall and cell membrane), as well as in mammalian cells such as the cells of the intestinal endothelium, and cells along the line of newly calcifying bone. Both the bacterial and mammalian enzymes are zinc metal loenzymes. The known function of alkaline phosphatase is the nonspecific hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters, but many of the enzyme's functions in the complex environment of the cell are not fully understood and it also may participate in phosphate transport and phosphate transfer reactions. Bone phosphatase is essential for bone calcification, as human mutants lacking the enzyme activity do not calcify their bones. The enzyme does participate in transferase activity in the test tube with suitable acceptors such as Tris buffer and ethanolamine. Acceptors must carry an amino function on a carbon adjacent to a carbon carrying an alcoholic hydroxyl. 325 image: ------- The physiologic dinplications of alcohol dehydrogenase are obvious be- cause of its central position in the metabolic pathway for the exogenous (and possibly endogenous) metabolite, ethanol. dismutase, a zinc-copper protein also known as erytii- rocuprein, has become the subject of recent interest because of the theory organisms carrying out that its presence is necessary for / aerobic metabolism by protecting the organism from damage by the superoxide radical. This radical is the product of a number of enzyme-catalyzed reactions involving oxygen: for example, the oxidation of xanthine to urate by xanthine oxidase. Radicals as products are likely to occur since reactions involving oxygen usually proceed in one-electron steps involving free-radical intermediates because of the spin restriction applying to the addition of two electrons to molecular oxygen. The enzyme catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide radical rapidly, limited only by the difusion of substrate. Aldolase is a central enzyme in the pathway of anaerobic glycolysis and in organisms such as yeast, Zn(II) is an essential component although the mammalian muscle enzyme is not a metalloenzyme. In this enzyme, a specific lysyl -NIL,\"1\" group is the substitute for the zinc function. Aspartate transcarbamylase is important in pyrimidine biosynthesis and the bacterial enzyme is the only well-characterized zinc metalloenzyme in which zinc directly and exclusively affects enzyme structure, since the metal is contained in the regulatory subunit of this enzyme and the catalytic subunit is active in the absence of metal. Zinc is involved indirectly in the regulation of enzymatic activity, since its presence is required for the proper association of regulatory and catalytic subunits to form the function- ing hexamers of this allosteric enzyme. 326 image: ------- ROLE OF ZINC AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL The protonatable amino acid side chains of proteins have been the obvious candidates as ligands to the zinc in metalloproteins. These chemical groups include the carboxyl groups of aspartyl and glutamyl residues, the N-terminal ^-amino groups of the peptide chain, the I -amino groups of lysyl residues, the imidazole nitrogens of histidyl residues -- the most likely candidates considering their chemical properties of pKfl and formation constants \u2014 the phenolic hydroxyl groups of tyrosyl residues, the sulfhydryl groups of cysteinyl residues and the guanidino groups of arginyl residues. The -NH-group of the peptide bond has been shown in certain model systems, especially Zn(II)-peptide complexes, to form a coordinate bond with loss of its proton. Thus this group is also a potential donor in the formation of metal-protein complexes. Of this group, only three have been identified as Zn(II) ligands in Zn(II) metalloproteins: the imidasole nitrogen, the <-carboxyl glutamic acid and the sulfhydryl group of cysteine. Carboxypeptidase A coordinates the Zn(II) through the imidazole nitrogens of two histidyl residues and the V1-carboxyl group of a 644 glutamyl residue. Thermolysin, a bacterial endopeptidase similar to 990 Carboxypeptidase A, has the same three ligands to the Zn(II) ion. In both proteins, the fourth coordination position of a distorted tetrahedron is occupied by a water molecule. The Zn(II) of carbonic anhydrase is coordinated to the imidazole nitrogens of three histidyl residues. A fourth coordination site is also open to solvent and occupied by a water molecule or an hydroxyl ion.275a'303'9^2 Indirect evidence from nitrogen nuclear hyperfine splitting of the electron spin resonance signal of the Cu(II) derivative of alkaline 327 image: ------- phosphatase suggests the presence of three nitrogen nuclei as ligands to 275a the metal ion (probably imidazole nitrogens). Spectral data and amino acid analysis have established that Zn(II) binds to sulfhydryl groups in the protein metallothionein from mammalian kidney. ' Zn(II) also binds to 275a sulfhydryl groups in alcohol dehydrogenase. To draw conclusions about the nature of coordination sites to be found at the active centers of metalloenzymes, the large body of information that exists for small coordination complexes must be studied. In these systems, however, the ligands are flexible and free to assume bond lengths and bond angles dictated by the electron distribution in the d-orbitals of the metal ion. Bond lengths and bond angles in enzyme coordination sites, however, may be dictated as much by the stereochemistry of relatively inflexible protein ligands as the electron distribution in the metal ion's orbitals. Such inflexibility may be one of the advantages of a large protein molecule as a catalyst in that a particularly unstable configuration of amino acid residues (considered as an isolated structure) may be maintained at one site in the molecule (e.g., the active site) by the stabilizing effect of structure in the rest of the molecule. Such \"strain\" could radically affect the stability of particular complexes and affect the reactivity of the metal ion toward a sub- strate in a mixed complex formed during catalysis. Highly purified zinc metalloenzymes for which the relative affinities of several first transition and IIB metal ions for the metal -binding site have been determined show an extraordinary preference for Zn(II) compared to Co(II), Ni(II) i and Cu(II) , although the sites in most cases are made up of nitrogen and oxygen ligands, which have greater affinity for the other three ions in simple systems. Model systems would suggest that all Zn(II) binding sites should contain sulfur ligands, since sulfur is known to have a particularly high affinity for Zn(II) , a property that does not occur uniformly in nature. 328 image: ------- The Zn(II) ion does not appear to be necessary for the synthesis of the apoprotein nor does it have to be present to assure the presence of the high affinity Zn(II) binding site. The Zn(II) enzyme, alkaline phosphatase, has been thoroughly examined in this regard. Escherichia coli grown in a zinc- free medium derepressed with physicochemical characteristics identical to the apoenzyme produced by removal of the metal with chelating agents.2753 The apoenzyme synthesized by the Zn(II)-deficient organisms can be completely reactivated by the addition of Zn(II). The organism can synthesize enzymes containing Co(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II) if these metal ions are added to the zinc- free medium, but Zn(II) will overpower the other three metals at relative con- centrations much below those expected for competititve binding to model coor- dination complexes. This dominance could be related to the fact that most of the protein binding sites have highly distorted ligand geometry, a function of the three-dimensional structure of proteins. The first transition metals with unfilled d-shells generally derive significant stabilization of their complexes from the ligand field stabilization energy, provided the geometric arrange- ment of the ligands is such that low energy orbitals exist that can be occupied and higher energy orbitals are left vacant or half-occupied. If the ligands are prevented from assuming the ideal geometry that maximizes the splitting of the orbital energy levels (as may occur because of restraints in the protein structure), the metal complex will be destabilized in relation to the usual models. However, zinc with a filled d-shell and no field stabilization energy from the ligand may accommodate the distorted geometry without destabiliza- tion resulting. It has been speculated that zinc operates in its capacity as a Lewis acid and withdraws electrons from certain groups of the substrate in mixed enzyme- metal-substrate complexes. The open coordination sites in carboxypeptidase A, 329 image: ------- thermolysin, and carbonic anhydrase clearly suggest this possibility. Only in the case of carboxypeptidase A has the structure of an enzyme-metal-substrate complex been determined. The X-ray structure of the crystalline glycyl-L- tyrosine complex with carboxypeptidase A shows the Zn(II) ion to be coordinated to the carbonyl oxygen of the susceptible peptide bond which is placed in the 644 position of the coordinated water molecule in the free enzyme. Mechanisms proposed for carbonic anhydrase suggest coordination between Zn(II) and the oxygen of an active hydroxyl ion in hydration or the oxygen of bicarbonate in the dehydration reaction, but no direct proof is available. a Whether a simple Lewis acid function applies in all instances or even in all hydrolysis or hydration reactions catalyzed by zinc metalloenzymes is not clear. Structural roles for Zn(II) have been suggested, but evidence has been difficult to obtain. In aspartate transcarbamylase the Zn(II) is not at the active site, but seems 1772 to participate primarily in the structure of the regulatory subunit. EVOLUTION OF ZINC ENZYMES If one of the major functions of zinc in the biosphere is its fundamental catalytic role in metalloenzynes, then an important question is, how uni- versal among the various phyla is it that the catalysts for these particular reactions are zinc metal loproteins? Is the evolution of a given zinc metalloenzyme a relatively restricted event, or have these zinc macrono- lecular catalysts existed over long periods of evolution? A great amount of phylogenetic information has been gathered on seme of these zinc enzymes fron isolating and characterizing the enzymes (listed in Table 9-1) from plants, and primitive and higher animals all the way up to primates, including man. The sources from which the enzymes were obtained, the molecular weight, and the zinc content are given in Table 9-3. Usually if an enzyme is a zinc enzyme 330 image: ------- in one species, it will contain zinc in another; for inany enzymes the zinc is maintained in the enzyme from bacteria to man. Thus in an enzyme like carbonic anhydrase, the active site of zinc is present in the enzymes of the elasmbbranch, a species that split off from the mainstream of animal evolution approximately 350 million years before the evolution of mammals. Therefore some zinc enzymes are under little evolutionary pressure to change. However, there are notable exceptions. The aldolase of yeast is a zinc enzyme, whereas the aldolase of the mammalian muscle is definitely not. An c-amino group of a lysyl residue of the protein provides a complete reaction through the formation of a ketimine intermediate without the assistance of a metal ion. Another notable substitution occurs within the enzyme superoxide dismutase: the bacterial enzyme is a manganese metallo- protein, but the mammalian enzyme is a zinc-copper protein. OTHER POSSIBLE BIOLOGIC FUNCTIONS OF ZINC Whereas the enzymatic functions of zinc outlined above form a specific and fundamental basis for the biologic function of zinc, a number of complex 1652 syndromes have been described in animals as a result of zinc deficiency. In many of these syndromes, however, it is very difficult to ascribe the patho- logic findings (both chemical and morphologic) to the malfunction of all or some of the zinc enzymes described above. This may relate to the difficulty of predicting the chemical and morphologic changes responsible for disrupting a single or limited number of enzymatic steps in a complex and interrelated series of metabolic pathways. For example, a disorder similar to cirrhosis of the liver appears in zinc-deficient pigs and a relationship to alcohol dchydro- genase might be postulated. It has been found that serum zinc content of alcoholic humans with cirrhosis has been low and urinary zinc excretion has been high. 331 image: ------- However, some features of zinc deficiency syndromes reflect unknown biologic functions of zinc. One example is the well-characterized zinc 1710 deficiency that occurs in Euglena gracilis. In zinc-deficient media, these organisms fail to grow well, and undergo peculiar morphologic changes. Chemical analyses have shown that the concentration of DNA per cell doubles, whereas protein and RNA synthesis are radically depressed. In addition, a derangement of the relative concentration of other metals and a 1710 striking increase in acid-insoluble polyphosphate occur. It has been suggested that zinc participates either in the structure and function of nucleic acids or in protein synthesis, through effects on ribosomal structure or on specific enzymes involved in protein synthesis. Indeed, it has been shown 1712 that RNA isolated from diverse biologic sources does contain zinc and that added zinc and other metal ions significantly affect RNA structure, as revealed 518 in melting curves. Zinc may have important enzymatic functions of which we are not yet fully aware. For example, isolated samples of DMA. and RNA polymerase contain zinc (Table 9-2). If zinc were essential to proper transcription in Euglena, the chemical findings reported would be consistent with the activity necessary to that function. However, finding zinc in a given biologic specimen is not in itself sufficient evidence for function, because zinc is a ubiquitous element in biologic fluids, second only to iron in relative concentration among the transition elements. More direct relationships between the contained metal and enzymatic activity must be demonstrated. Zinc has been clearly proved to participate in the structures and mechanisms of action of many enzymes. But it is possible that zinc also functions in maintaining the ionic environment necessary for certain biologic processes or in the maintenance of the structure of certain nonenzymatic proteins. For example, the cadndum-containing protein 807 metanothionein has been isolated from kidney, and shown to contain sub- stantial amounts of zinc. The biologic function of this protein is not known at present. 332 image: ------- 9-3 Comparative Biochemistry of Zinc Metal loenzymes Source Molecular Zinc Content, Weight gram atom/moleg.

Decreased concentration of zinc in serum and liver tissue and the increased excretion of zinc in the urine have been reported in patients with 610,1568,1666,1667,1668 1273 alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. Prasad et al. found decreased zinc in red blood cells of cirrhotic subjects. Oral adminis- 1568 tration of zine sulfate was reported to improve some liver functions, but these studies were uncontrolled and attempts to confirm their results have not been successful. 1666,1667 in chronic alco- holism, patients commonly exhibit serum zinc concentrations two standard deviations below the normal mean, elevated urinary zinc excretion, and increased 1 568 clearance of renal zinc. Urinary zinc excretion returned to normal in some patients without cirrhosis who abstained from alcohol for 1-2 wk. 1568 But in patients with postalcoholic cirrhosis the changes persist. Administration of alcohol to normal subjects has been associated with a slight increase in urinary zinc excretion, but it is difficult to predict 1564 whether such an increase may occur. The zincuria of alcoholism may be somewhat similar to the renal defect 1568 for magnesium found in alcoholics. Prolonged and excessive intake 336 image: ------- of alcohol with insufficient dietary intake of protein and other nutrients may produce primary renal dysfunction with excessive excretion of zinc and/or magnesium. Use of intravenous zinc-65 suggested that the hyperzincuria in cirrhotic patients was not caused by a specific renal defect;1567 a more general abnormality of cellular zinc metabolism was postulated. Rats with cirrhosis exhibited reduced serum and liver zinc levels.810 Laboratory models of hepatic cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride and other agents have also been used to study the role of zinc in liver ab- normalities. Liver damaged by carbon tetrachloride has been used to study other manifestations of liver pathology related to zinc. Voigt and Saldeen1701 showed that water-soluble zinc salts given parenterally inhibit liver damage produced by manganese in golden hamsters and carbon tetrachloride in rats. A histochemical study139^ demonstrated that mice with hepatic damage from carbon tetrachloride had much less pronounced enzyme changes when treated with zinc beforehand to protect them. In animals treated simultaneously with carbon tetrachloride and zinc chloride, alkaline phosphatase increased in newly formed tissue in the peripheral zone of the damaged liver. However, no difference in activity between zinc metalloenzymes or zinc-dependent enzymes was found.1396 The uptake of zinc-65 in rat liver damaged by carbon tetrachloride increased; uptake was greater in animals with damaged liveuthan in controls.1809 Zinc was taken up by the parenchymal cells but not by the Kupffer cells.1396 However, even after acute carbon tetrachloride damage, uptake of zinc-65 was still rapid,89a suggesting that any alteration in zinc-65 uptake in damaged rat liver requires time following the insult to be apparent. 337 image: ------- In all patients with infectious hepatitis, serum concentrations of total zinc decreased early in the acute phase of the viral disease and then rose 683 to normal as the illness subsided; diffusible serum zinc concentrations were elevated early in the acute phase of the disease and fell to normal as 683 the disease subsided. Serum changes were always accompanied by a signif- icant zincuria during the early acute phase of the illness and by a return to normal as the illness subsided. Little about the zincuria or the levels of plasma zinc of hepatitis patients has been agreed upon; some investigators discovered no change from normal urinary zinc excretion but a lowering of plasma zinc (which eventually 819 returned to normal), while others noted variability in urinary excretion 361,608,809 and plasma concentrations of zinc. The disagreement may be related either to the failure to specify the stage of the illness at which the patients were studied or to differences in methodology. Studies carried out late in the disease may have missed the elevated urinary zinc excretion and lowered serum zinc levels observed in the acute phase. Decreased concentrations of total plasma zinc and increased urinary zinc 610, excretion have been observed in patients with several forms of liver disease. 683,819 Attempts have been made to correlate abnormal levels of plasma zinc 661,809 with the severity of the hepatic disease with moderate success. In patients with acute viral hepatitis, the lowest serum total zinc concentrations and the highest levels of diffusible serum zinc and urinary zinc excretion were observed in patients hospitalized because of the severity of their 683 disease. 338 image: ------- Normally, there are two classes of zinc ligands Macromolec- class; micromolecular zinc ligands, including amino acids and species such as porphyrins and peptides, exemplify the other,, The equilibrium of these ligands in serum depends upon their respective concen- trations of albumin and amino acids, particularly levels of histidine and cysteine.537'538'668 In vitro, the amount of ultrafilterable or diffusible zinc has been shown to increase as the concentration of these amino acids increases. Exchangeable zinc is bound mainly to albumin, and the affinity of zinc for albumin is altered sharply in favor of the amino acids histidine and cysteine if their concentration 537,538,668 in serum is elevated or if albumin concentration is decreased <, However, urinary zinc excretion is related primarily to the amount of micromolecular-liganded zinc complexes because they readily pass the renal glomerulus and are excreted in urine. Indeed, oral administration of histidine (\\T\\ 679 to humans has produced significant hyperzincuria and hypozincemia. * In general, significant decreases in plasma albumin or globulin do not 1481a occur in acute viral hepatitis. No such decreases were observed in 683 the patients studied by Henkin and Smith. However, the concentration of some amino acids in plasma have 339 image: ------- 460a been reported to increase by 20% and increased urinary excretion of amino acids such as histidine, lysine, and glutamine has been observed. a These amino acids also may be released into the circulation during the destruction of liver cells 683 that accompanies severe liver disease. Thus, the increased concentra- tion of plasma and urinary free amino acids observed in hepatitis might be associated with shifts in the binding of zinc from macromolecular to micro- molecular ligands and consequent increases in diffusible zinc. These changes would account for the significant zincuria and liver losses of zinc observed in this disease. Another mechanism by which diffusible zinc might be increased during hepatitis is by reducing the affinity of the macromolecular zinc ligands for zinc. In those patients observed by Henkin and Smith, serum diffusible zinc 683 varied directly with bilirubin concentration. When calculated separately, the correlation between plasma bilirubin and diffusible zinc in patients with bilirubin concentrations greater than 6 mg/100 ml (correlation coefficient 0.949) was greater than that in patients with bilirubin concentrations less than 6 mg/100 ml (correlation coeficient = 0.605). Whereas the correlations in the entire group and in each of the two subgroups were all highly signif- icant (probability < 0.001), the higher correlation coefficient suggests a closer relationship between bilirubin and diffusible zinc at higher bilirubin concentrations. Nevertheless, the normal concentration of albumin in plasma (650 uM) is so much greater than that of zinc (15 yM) or bilirubin (1 y M), that even 340 image: ------- in the event of severe pathologic increases in bilirubin,478a\u00bb762b'1652\u00bb1809a the displacement of zinc by bilirubin from a common binding site cannot account for the observed increase in the concentration of diffusible zinc. One attempt to clarify this complex relationship was made by Lindeman and Baxter, who suggested that alterations in serum binding of zinc-65 were present in patients with cirrhosis.933* Schecter et al. * studied the distribution of serum zinc between albumin and ou-macroglobulin in patients with decompensated hepatic cirrhosis. Not only did those patients with cirrhosis exhibit lower than normal zinc levels, but a greater proportion of the zinc in their serum (about 50%) was associated with cu-macroglobulin, an amount significantly higher than percentages found in normal subjects (between 20-30%). Schecter et al.1420a also noted that albumin-bound zinc in serum was lower than that of normals, as expected. ' a Decreased levels of zinc have also been found in the serum, red and white blood cells,5^ and hair*28^ of cirrhotic patients. Increased urinary zinc excretion and a decreased total body zinc pool, was observed. All of these symptoms indicate that patients with decompensated hepatic cirrhosis exhibit a total body loss of zinc. Other Gastrointestinal Disorders and Malabsorption Various abnormalities of zinc in blood have been reported in patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Lower than normal levels of serum zinc have been reported in patients with kwashiorkor,630a>1412'1504 although hair zinc levels are elevated above normal.867a Lower than normal levels of zinc in blood have been reported in patients with regional enteritis;14043 \u00bb1522 gastrica. However, no abnormal hematic zinc 361 levels were found in patients with acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage or 972a following partial distal gastrectomy. Indeed, experimental production of gastric ulcers in dogs revealed decreased fecal zinc excretion and pre- sumed zinc retention in tissues. Increases in whole blood zinc in patients with chronic pancreatitis have been reported, the result of de- 1817a creased plasma zinc and increased red blood cell zinc. Zinc deficiency may affect exocrine activity of the pancreas. The metal has been shown to 1661 be an important component of pancreatic carboxypeptidase, and the activity of this enzyme was reduced in zinc-deficient rats. Hypogonadal Dwarfism Syndrome Dietary zinc deficiency has been associated with clinical symptoms in humans. Prasad et al. reported on a group of Iranian men whose diet consisted almost ex- 17 76 clusively of bread and beans. Their deficiency was related not only to the low level of zinc and protein in their diet, but the presence of phytate in the bread. Phytate tends to decrease the intestinal absorption of endogenous dietary zinc. 1276,1277,1278,1287,1412 _ f * * -u t j A Symptoms of deficiency in these patients were decreased zinc in plasma, red blood cells and hair; decreased urinary zinc excretion; rapid turnover rate of zinc-65 with decreased 24-h exchangeable pool; and decreased excretion of zinc-65 in feces and urine. Iron deficiency anemia, dwarfism, hypogonadism, hepatosplenomegaly, depression of adrenocorticotropin- (ACTH) production, and increased sensitivity to insulin 1412 was also found in a group of Egyptian adult males on a low-protein diet similar to that observed in the previously reported Iranian men. Although the Egyptian boys studied were infested with liver schistosomes, they excreted less urinary zinc than did normal subjects; this tendency contrasts with the zincuria seen in 342 image: ------- patients with cirrhosis of the liver on zinc-adequate diets. This observation suggested that these subjects, taking a diet which was apparently low in zinc, conserved zinc by reducing its excretion in urine. Anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, growth retardation and lower than normal levels of zinc in plasma were also observed in preadolescent Iranian children.4363 The basis for this syndrome was also considered to be the large amounts of phytate and fiber present in their diet. Dwarfism, hypogonadism and alterations in zinc metabolism have also been reported to occur in the U.S. without association with the dietary intake of large amounts of phytate or fiber. 214a Zinc salts and a good animal protein diet were fed to some Egyptian boys. All symptoms of the syndrome were reported to diminish or disappear, and the boys gained weight. The level of zinc in body fluids and hair were reported to return to normal levels. One patient only on an iron supplementation did not show these changes. After their plasma zinc had become normal, five patients returned to their native villages and resumed their original diets; their plasma zinc levels gradually decreased, reinforcing the conclusion that the described syndrome was caused by zinc deficiency. Ronaghy t al^ reported that administration of zinc supplements to malnourished Iranian school boys improved their skeletal \u00ab. 1363 growth . Several investigators have doubted that zinc deficiency alone produced this syndrome. The reported symptoms of these patients coexisted not only with zinc deficiency, but also with protein deficiency, and were manifested by de- 248 pressed levels of serum albumin and plasma protein. Thus, Coughey con- sidered the role of zinc deficiency overemphasized in these patients. In the only controlled clinical trial carried out in this patient group, a double*blind study of the administration of zinc sulfate and placebo indicated that no differences could be shown between the treatment groups. Plasma and erythrocyte zinc levels QO e are below normal in children suffering from protein calorie malnutrition; these 885 levels are lower in kwashiokor than they are in marasmus. Hair zinc in growth- retarded Iranian248and Egyptian248'1558 hypogonadal patients was below normal, 343 248 image: ------- although hair zinc levels in patients with either kwashiorkor or marasmus have been found to be similar & to or appreciably higher than in normal subjects. a In these latter patients plasma or erythrocyte zinc is lower than in normals or in patients with dietary zinc deficiency. These differences may be useful in differentiating between patients with abnormalities in zinc metabolism caused by dietary deficiency from those with protein calorie malnutrition. Some Egyptian patients with hypogonadism and growth retardation have attained sexual maturity and a normal stature without treatment or change in their low plasma zinc level. Thus the importance of the plasma zinc level as a reflection of zinc deficiency may be limited. Whether zinc is the sole factor limiting growth and development in these Iranian and Egyptian adolescents has also been 249 250 1281 questioned. A debate about the limited \" versus sole importance of zinc in growth and development in these patients has continued over the past few years. Although this problem has not yet been resolved, it is clear that zinc deficiency itself can be a restrictive factor in growth and 612 development. That zinc deficiency can alter other biologic systems and offer an environment in which other pathologic processes may occur is readily apparent. 609,1282,1331 _ . -,,.,. * * In humans several pathologic processes may accompany zinc deficiency, making the issue of zinc deficiency per j3 difficult to define and the effects of treatment difficult to evaluate. Acrodermatitis Enteropathica rare Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a/ autosomal recessive disorder characterized by pathologic changes in several organ systems. Skin changes include alopecia totalis, paronychia, and bullous-pustular dermatitis of the extremities of and genital areas. Ophthalmic manifestations corneal diarrhea, malabsorption, steatorrhea 344 image: ------- and lactose intolerance. Tremor has been observed, along with occasional cerebellar ataxia, emotional lability, and irritability. Infections caused by Candida, albicans are frequent, as are retarded growth and hypogonadism. The disorder, described by Danbolt and Closs,354c and the clinical changes observed .since, have been defined and reviewed 440b'504c'802a>1232a' 1355a,1572a,1755a The disorder, although rare, may be observed more frequently in infants of Italian, Armenian, or Iranian origin, and usually develops after weaning from breast feeding. Diiodohydroxyquin therapy has been used with some success in these 384a patients since 1953, but neither the mechanism of the drug's action nor the pathologic basis for this disease was amenable to study until recently. In 1973, decreased levels of serum zinc were noted in an infant with acrodermatitis enteropathica, and after oral treatment with zinc sulfate a 77a,1086 complete remission of symptoms occurred. After inadvertent omission of zinc sulfate from the patient's treatment, the symptoms of the disease recurred; but they remitted again following reinstitution of zinc sulfate. The dramatic alleviation of this condition with oral zinc sulfate has been con- 1037b,1129a,1266a firmed. Reasons for the changes observed in these infants after therapy are not clear. That changes developed after weaning suggests either that infants 620a received too little dietary zinc following weaning or that absorption of zinc was impaired. Because very small amounts of zinc added to the diet appear to correct abnormalities, it is rather unlikely that a specific dietary 672b,1129a lack of zinc per se produces symptoms of acrodermatitis enteropathica. That treatment with diiodohydroxyquin is effective might be related to the 1085b formation of an absorbable zinc chelate. Human milk therapy may be helpful 950b for similar reasons. 345 image: ------- Although there may be a significant abnormality in the manner by which 950a,950b 515a,672b orally administered zinc-65 is absorbed, diverse data suggest that malabsorption cannot be the primary defect in acrodermatitis enteropathica. Although the nature of the defect is not clear, the lack of an appropriate factor in gastro- intestinal transport corrected by administration of even small amounts of oral zinc is an attractive hypothesis, because zinc binding and transport 672b after absorption appear to be intact. Such a zinc-binding protein has 873 been isolated from rat jejunal mucosa, although its role in active transport across the gut mucosa has not been firmly documented. Blood Dyscrasias Plasma zinc was found to be below normal in pernicious 1369,1802 1802 1802 anemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, 58 1802 Hodgkin's disease, and various other types of anemiaso In Hodgkin's 58 disease, whole blood zinc also, is diminished. After vitamin IL- therapy, the zinc serum level returned to normal in patients with pernicious 1802 anemia. Lower than normal levels of serum zinc have also been observed in some patients with thalassemia1275 and sickle-cell anemia,158a>1287a It has been suggested that zinc may counteract the deleterious effect of calcium on the red blood cell membrane. In uncontrolled studies administration of exogenous zinc has been claimed to improve the clinical status of patients with sickle cell anemia, assist in the healing of their peripheral ulcers and improve their clinical condition in general. Controlled clinical trials will be of importance to verify these provocative early findings. 1802 Elevated plasma zinc concentration was observed in patients with eosinophilia, 346 image: ------- lymphocytic lymphoma, severe untreated megaloblastic anemia, and multiple myeloma.58 These latter results in patients with multiple myeloma are at variance with those noted by other investigators,1586>1589and make it difficult to sort out the changes that occur in blood zinc levels in this condition. In megaloblastic anemia, treatment with folic acid returned zinc levels to normal after a few 58 days. No changes in the plasma zinc level were observed in six patients with polycythemia vera or in nine patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. 1367 Erythrocyte and plasma zinc were found to be reduced in Hodgkin's disease. 1367 Valberg ejt al. found an increase in the number of erythrocytes containing zinc in Hodgkin's disease, chronic myeloid and lymphatic leukemia, and in multiple 58 myeloma, an observation contrasting with Auerbach's results. The discrepancy may have been caused by different diagnostic criteria and whether patients were studied before or during therapy. The erythrocyte zinc of the leukemic subjects was higher than in the controls, ' except in patients with acute granulocytic leukemia. High erythrocyte zinc levels also were found in and pernicious anemia in relapse, although the degree of elevation did not correlate with the severity of the disease. Elevated erythocyte zinc values were also reported in patients with 1369 lymphoma and multiple myeloma, in contrast with lowered values reported by 1367 others. In megaloblastic anemia, high zinc levels in erythrocytes have been found to decrease with therapy, but elevated zinc values have not always 1369 been found in megaloblastic or pernicious anemia. In some cases, erythocyte zinc content correlated with the mean corpus- cular volume of the erythrocytes, as it did in cases of polycythemia rubra vera and myeloid metaplasia. However, this observed in leukemic patients.505 Talbot and Ross1592 attributed the greater amounts of zinc in erythro- cytes to the increased carbonic anhydrase that they found in patients with these disorders. 347 image: ------- Zinc in leukocytes of patients with lymphatic leukemia has been reported to decrease as the number of leukocytes increased and the disease process worsened. This inverse relationship is particularly common in patients with 377 a majority of premature forms of cells in their peripheral smear. In 56 t patients with chronic lymphocytic and granulocytic leukemia, or with acute lymphocytic, monocytic, and leukemias or myeloid metaplasia, values for zinc in leukocytes were less than normal in all groups. The lowest values occurred in subjects with chronic and acute lymphocytic leukemia. No correlation between zinc in leukocytes and total or differential leukocyte 505,1802 number could be established. In patients with chronic granulocytic 505 leukemia zinc in leukocytes rose in response to treatment. However, 510 Frischauf est al. did not find an essential difference in the zinc content in leukocytes of leukemia patients. High concentrations of zinc in leukocytes were found in patients with predominantly lymphoblastic forms of leukemias, whereas in lymphosarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma, and nonlymphomatous undifferentiated 237 carcinoma, the level of zinc was close to the normal range. The zinc content in granulocytes was studied in bone marrow and peripheral blood by a histochemical technique and results were graded on a semiquantative 1589 scale. Decreased zinc content was demonstrated in acute and chronic myelocytic leukemia, plasmacytoma, and Hodgkin's disease. During the remis- sion of leukemia the zinc content increased, but it was still below normal.158 903,1587 Rising zinc values were observed in lymphocytic leukemia. In patients 1589 with myelosclerosis, the zinc content of bone marrow granulocytes was elevated. In four 348 image: ------- 1587 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, increased 2inc levels were obsc-rved. 1588 Szmigielski suggested that the amount of zinc protein in granulo- cytes decreased in leukemic patients. Free protoporphyrin can be demonstrated in leukemic cells, but it cannot be found in normal granulocytes; he therefore hypothesized that protein synthesis with a pro- toporphyrin prosthetic group was inhibited in leukemic cells. He related the decrease in zinc content to the increase of free protoporphyrin in leukemic cells, but it did not appear that the protein which regulated the maturity of granulocytes contained a zinc-protoporphyrin-prosthetic group. Decreased zinc in granulocytes of patients with acute and chronic myeloid leukemia was one of the most constant signs of the disturbances in leukemic 903 cells. As so often in zinc metabolism, the meaning of these differing observations is not immediately apparent. 373a Delves et al. reported that the ratio of plasma copper to zinc was elevated in children with untreated leukemia. This ratio was useful in evaluating patients' responses to therapy. Other Cancers Numerous studies of the role of or the change in serum zinc in malig- nancies have been performed, but the meaning of these findings is obscure. The behavior of zinc in malignancy may depend upon the site, nature and state of the cancer as well as the nature of the treatment. 349 image: ------- 361 Davies et^ al. suggested that decreased zinc levels in serum of patients with carcinoma of the bronchus are one of the most constant char- acteristics of the disease because they remain in normal ranges in all other pulmonary illnesses. The constancy of these decreased levels has 361,1802 been contradicted. Lowered zinc plasma levels have been reported 361 1802 in patients with carcinoma of the colon. Wolff, who studied 45 patients with carcinoma of different etiologies and sites, also found de- 361 creased serum zinc levels. After studying 49 cases, Davies et_ l. did not find significantly lower serum zinc values in patients with .carcinomas than in the control group, except for those with carcinoma of the bronchus and colon. X-ray therapy also has been said to produce an immediate in- 1802 crease in serum zinc values. More recently, patients with osteosarcoma had elevated concen- 474a 800a trations of serum zinc, a finding previously demonstrated. However, 474a Fisher et^ al. also noted that patients with osteosarcoma with metastases had depressed serum zinc. It has been suggested that the level of zinc in cancerous organs was higher than in normal tissue, although the tumors themselves may exhibit 813,1241 decreased zinc content depending on the phase of the disease. 7 Serum zinc levels have been elevated in some forms of leukemia, and lower than normal levels of zinc were found in leukocytes of patients with various 505 acute and chronic leukemias. Urinary zinc was reported to be three times as high in patients with various malignancies as in normal subjects, and their urinary excretion of molybdenum was also decreased; a zinc:molybdenum ratio 1241 higher than 300:1 was considered a manifestation of cancer. An increase of the zinc:molybdenum ratio in urine was observed during the progression 1650 * of the malignancy. 350 image: ------- A small increase of zinc in 30% of patients with carcinoma was observed in erythrocytes,1650 whereas zinc in the leukocytes of patients with different types of carcinoma showed a decrease even in 18/i,185 very early stages of the disease. This change has been suggested as a useful early test of the disease. A decrease of plasma zinc even as an early prognostic of cancer was suggested after analyzing 1588 the zinc content of blood granulocytes of 50 patients. The granulo- cyte zinc content in cancer of the skin was reported to decrease in advanced stages of the malignancy. The content of zinc in carcinoma of the prostate is of special interest because this organ normally contains the highest amount of zinc in any soft tissue in the body. In prostate, the level of zinc in malignant 1586 cells was much lower than in normal pro static tissue. As in pros- tatic carcinoma, zinc content was increased rather than decreased in hyper- plastic prostate glands. Cystic Flbrosis (CF) of the Pancreas Patients with CF exhibit higher levels of various electrolytes\u2014 particularly sodium and potassium in eccrine sweat\u2014than do normal sub- jects, and this phenomenon has been useful in diagnosing the condition. Spvever. zinc levels in hair and nails were reported to be lower than in 86ft comparable controls, although actual levels were not given. Mean zinc concentration in cerumen was 16 times higher in controls than in patients with 151 CF. . Pancreatic zinc concentrations in patients with CF were significantly lower than those of controls. The mean zinc concentration in the pancreases 351 image: ------- from 17 controls was 193+94 ug zinc, whereas mean concentrations for 35 patients with CF was only 77 + 73 yg zinc/g dry pancreas. Lower levels were associated with the more seveVe form of the disease. Duodenal fluid from a patient with CF contained 868 almost no zinc. Differences among cerumen, hair and nails, which have lower than normal zinc levels, and sweat and saliva, which have been reported to contain higher levels, do not yield to simple interpretation. Of further interest is the relative sterility of males and the reduced fertility of women with CF. Decreased gonadal function is a common accompaniment of zinc deficiency. Yet zinc levels in semen from men with CF are reportedly higher than 1385 in corresponding controls, because the ejaculate of CF patients contains mainly fluid from the prostate with little or no fluid from the testis or epididymus. Infectious Processes Zinc in serum and urine of subjects in whom experimental viral and bacterial Infections have been induced has been carefully studied. Under controlled conditions, Subjects were inf ected with viral and bacterial agents. Serum zinc levels decreased rapidly after the onset of the viremia or bacteremia, but before 1219 fever was measured. The zinc decreased throughout the course of the infectious process and was accompanied by a significant zincuria. i These changes have been related to an alteration of body zinc pools by a leukocytic endogenous mediator (LEM), a heat-labile protein released from sensitized polymorphonuclear leukocytes. LEM appears to produce a 94a,94b,94c, prompt hypozincemia and a concomitant increase in hepatic zinc. 414a,720a,814a,1217a,1217b,1219,1219a,1285a 352 image: ------- Lower than normal levels of zinc in blood have been observed in patients with typhus and acute dysentery. 140 Changes in serum and urinary zinc following infection may reflect a natural body defense mechanism.1748 Because zinc is necessary to the growth of viral or bacterial agents, decreased hematic zinc could represent a signifi- cant factor in the virostatic and bacteriostatic processes of the body.1748 Decreased serum zinc and increased serum copper and iron are thought to be changes that occur in response to invasion by viruses and bacteria; these alterations may 1748 be part of the normally active homeostatlc mechanism of the body. It is curious, however, that zinc was able to display antiviral activity at the nontoxic concentra- 870 tion of 0.1 yM in tissue culture of viruses. The metal inhibited formation of infectious virions at any stage of the replication cycle.870 Zinc also inhibited the cleavage of precursor molecules. Out of 11 other metals, in- cluding cadmium, copper, cobalt, mercury, molybdenum and nickel, only zinc 871 had these antiviral effects at nontoxic levels of the metal. In vitro data suggest that at higher concentrations zinc markedly inhibits the cleavage of polio and encephalomyocarditis virus polypeptides in relation 871 to rhinoviruses. % Drug Metabolism Various drugs alter zinc metabolism in man and animals. In the rat, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea results in retinal atrophy, cataracts, 877 and significantly increased zinc content in the eyes. However, administration of 6-azauridine, an antimetabolite effective in inhibiting de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and treating psoriasis, uniformly is linked to reduced serum zinc concentration and increased urinary zinc excretion.1495 Administration of 6-azauridine has been associated with the appearances of histidinuria, homocystinuria, and ex- cessive levels 353 image: ------- of histidine, cysteine, and homocysteine in blood. Other drugs may be associated with total body zinc loss and the appearance of the most common symptoms of it. Drugs that interfere with protein synthesis most commonly produce zinc loss, and they are used in 1092 the treatment of malignant processes. Common clinical symptoms of zinc deficiency observed have been anorexia and weight loss, hypogeusia, 671 hyposmia, dysgeusia, and dysosmia. However, zinc deficiency in the rat has been associated with a reduction in the metabolic rates of pentobarbital, aminopyrine, and -nitrobenzolc acid. was of these zinc- deficient rats. All biochemical and pharmacologic abnormalities reverted to normal after 14 days of zinc repletion. Renal Disease and Chronic Dialysis In patients with proteinuria related to any renal lesion, associated zincuria and a subsequent loss of total body zinc are reflected in decreased serum zinc concentrations. In renal diseases in which proteinuria is not a significant factor, total body zinc levels are variable. In one study of patients with uremia, plasma zinc levels were lower than normal, urinary zinc excretion was within normal limits, and levels of zinc were normal in most 308 tissues except for those in the kidney, which were lower. 354 image: ------- or) o The zinc within various body pools of these patients has been redistributed. 613,975,1440a,1802 This relationship has been well documented. In rats, plasma 308 zinc levels decreased after ureteral'ligation, but kidney zinc increased. Other organs showed little or no change. Several changes have occurred in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis. In early trials with extracorporeal dialysis, loss of total body copper and a subsequent neuropathy occurred. Some attempts to counteract the loss produced acute copper toxicosis. 7>971,9/5,976,989a changes in zinc in blood and tissues also occurred during these episodes, perhaps reflecting zinc 127,1075b content of the dialysis fluids and the tubing as well. When these materials were purified, many of the acute changes in copper and zinc metabolism were obviated. The values obtained appear to depend, in part, on the type of membrane coils used, but the state of the patient before dialysis and the length 1816d of the dialysis may also have their effect. Patients undergoing chronic extra- corporeal dialysis (with current technology) have a slight but consistent decrease in serum zinc concentration from the zinc found in the dialysate. Although zinc is reduced, a small but consistent increase in copper is found in the serum and in some tissues of dialysis patients (unpublished observations, R. I. Henkin and C. W. Mueller) It also has been suggested that the way the kidney handles zinc differs from 1547a the way in which it handles sodium, calcium, and magnesium. 355 image: ------- Schizophrenia and Emotional Disorders Serum zinc levels of schizophrenics have been reported to be lower 840,1239 than in controls; brain autopsy specimens from schizophrenics were found to contain approximately half as much zinc as brains of patients with diseases such as progressive paralysis, congenital syphilis, 840 epilepsy, and erysipelas. The urinary zinc level was elevated in a 378a patient with porphyria and symptoms of schizophrenia. In this patient, the authors related the changes in zinc levels to the psychiatric symptoms observed, but it is well known that patients with acute porphyria exhibit hyperzincemia. However, in a study of 20 untreated patients with acute and chronic schizophrenia, Gillin (unpublished observations) could ascertain no difference between blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, or gastric fluid zinc levels of patients with untreated schizophrenia and controls. These findings are set forth in Table 10-1. TABLE 10-1 Comparison of Zinc Content in Various Tissues of Patients with Untreated Schizophrenia and Normal Controls^ Serum, Urine, CSF,\u2014 Gastric Fluid, Subjects 1 42 \u00b1 4 Controls 82 92 \u00b1 2 353 \u00b1 23 7 \u00b1 2 40 \u00b1 5 -Data from J. C. Gillin -Cerebrospinal fluid - + 1 SEM 356 image: ------- During insulin shock, serum zinc concentrations were reported to 840 J increase; it was suggested that the enzymes responsible for glycolysis were zinc-containing enzymes and that insulin treatment increased the activity of carbonic anhydrase. Zinc loss has been correlated with abnormal mental behavior. Zinc-deficient rats were reported to exhibit 950 impaired maze learning compared to pair-fed and ad libitum controls. Zinc-deficient children were reported to perform below normal on cognitive 1246a and perceptual motor tests. Disturbances of mood have been observed 1085a in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica and kwashiorkor, and the acute loss of zinc following L-histidine administration commonly is associated with psychotic ideations, including paranoid delusions, depression, and other profound changes in mental state, symptoms which have been reversed after zinc 679 sulfate therapy. 357 image: ------- Other Disorders Reduced plasma zinc levels were found in patients with psoriasis, 559 874 1794 various dermatoses, and venous leg ulceration. ' Withers et al. examined patients with chronic venous ulceration and observed lowered plasma zinc. 1802 Wolff measured serum zinc in many patients and found it to be lower than normal in many acute and chronic conditions, including hypothy- roidism (higher than normal levels were found in hyperthyroidism and hyper- tension) . Lower than normal levels of serum and plasma zinc have also been 1252 reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Parenteral Nutrition Fluids rich in amino acids are being given parenterally in increasingly common fashion to assist the alimentation of patients with various disorders or appetitive when their own absorptive/mechanisms prove faulty. Parenteral hyperalimen- tation usually is accomplished with a mixture of essential amino acids, glucose, and electrolytes. Administration of these fluids Is commonly followed by losses of 358 image: ------- total body zinc, ' ' perhaps because of the interaction of those with amino acids / the zinc bound to albumin. Albumin-bound zinc is shifted to the amino acids and this amino acid-bound zinc freely passes the renal glo- merulus and is excreted in the urine. The loss of total body zinc may become profound and can contribute to the patient's already severe systemic abnormalities. One way to obviate this loss is through the appropriate and judicial use of zinc added to the parenteral fluids administered. Cardiovascular Disease Various abnormalities of zinc metabolism have been observed in patients 613,632a,999a with myocardial infractions. Changes occur in hematic zinc levels and 1711 999a metalloenzymes, and abnormalities of acute myocardial injury in man 632a and experimental animals. It is unclear whether the changes observed in blood zinc levels reflect specific changes related to myocardial function or general changes from stress associated with it or other similar condi- 462,479a,1466a tions. A relationship between decreased incidence of cardiovascular mortality in areas supplied by hard water, has been proposed, although mean serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were higher in subjects drinking hard llla,333b,873a,982a,1446a water than in those drinking soft water. what characteristics of hard water that appear to convey this protection is not Ilia clear, but the magnesium and calcium content of the water may be important, 982a as might be the trace metal content. 359 image: ------- Klevay has suggested that an imbalance between zinc and copper is an 858 important factor in the production of hypercholesterolemia in rats and perhaps in humans. He has suggested that animal fat ingestion and the zinc: copper ratio in milk may be important in the etiology of cardiovascular Q C QV disorders in man. These hypotheses have yet to be fully tested and are not generally accepted. Vitamin Metabolism In 1939, Patek and Haig observed that some patients with hepatic cirrhosis exhibited a night blindness that did not improve with treatment with vitamin A.1213b Later studies also suggested a clinical 612a,851a correlation between some forms of liver disease and night blindness. During the acute phase of viral hepatitis, patients not only had serum 683 zinc levels lower than normal, but serum vitamin A and retinol 682a (vitamin A alcohol) binding protein levels were similarly low. Although hepatic levels of vitamin A are normal in zinc-deficient 1512 rats, hematic vitamin A levels appear to be low, as are serum levels 1514 of retinol and retinol-blnding protein. Concentrations of serum retinol were shown to be lower in zinc-deficient than in zinc-supplemented , . 1413 lambs. These studies suggest a relationship between zinc metabolism and vitamin A metabolism. Some of the animal studies were carried out with diets in which less than adequate amounts of protein were fed to the experimental group and pair- fed controls were not systematically employed. Nevertheless, zinc might be necessary to convert retinol to retinene (vitamin A aldehyde) 360 the in reductase, an enzyme similar to alkaline phosphatase in molecular weight, amino composition, and dependence upon zinc. 420 Relationships between zinc and the metabolism of several B vitamins, 728a 528 and between zinc and thiamine, and with pyridoxine, 282 1781 biotin, and folic acid have been noted. The action of zinc and vitamins on food intake in animals was noted in 1934. Feeding either biotin or folic acid had little effect on the growth, food intake, or depleted levels of zinc in liver, hair or serum of growing, 1201 zinc-deficient rats. Congenital Malformations There are no direct data which demonstrate a sure teratogenic effect in humans caused by zinc deficiency. However, Sever and Emanuel have deduced from preliminary epidemiologic data that a possible teratogenic effect of 1475 zinc deficiency in man may exist. Some of these speculations were based upon the high rates of malformations in the central nervous systems of infants born in Egypt and Iran, countries where zinc deficiency has been , t , 353a 756,757,759,761a 1584,1731,1732 commonly observed. Hurley and others also have speculated that maternal zinc deficiency may cause congenital 754a malformation in humans. However, the rat, the model with which Hurley has worked extensively, is highly susceptible to the effects of various teratogenic agents such as antibiotics and cancer chemotheropeutic agents and therefore may not be a relevant model for man. Yet a dam may be fed a zinc-deficient ration 361 image: ------- with, little pr no change in total body zinc content, although the rat fetus may be severely damaged.756'757 Indeed, the fetus may be damaged even if zinc in- take decreased only for a short time during the pregnancy. Some investigators have speculated that American women may ingest marginal to deficient amounts of zinc. Thus, it is conceivable that during some periods of pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, too little zinc reaches the fetus. How this affects fetal growth or development is not fully known. Studies of serum zinc levels generate little useful data because estrogens and other gonadal and placental hormones may depress serum zinc levels regardless of the amount of zinc intake. Hambidge reported a significant decline in hair zinc in pregnant women between the seventeenth and thirty-seventh weeks of gestation, but the meaning of these reductions cannot be readily evaluated because hair zinc does not always reflect the level of total body zinc accurately with respect to time of sampling. Porphyria Abnormalities of divalent transition metals are associated with various types f , . 378a,1171a,1235c,1349a,1360 of porphyria. Patients with active porphyria of several types have been reported to excrete excessive amounts of zinc in their urine, C) although their serum levels of zinc may not be altered?253'1360 In 1929, elevated urinary zinc excretion was observed in a patient during an acute exacerbation of porphyria. a Zinc-uroporphyrin chelates in urine have been 362 image: ------- 1349a,1738a measured, and found to be elevated in porphyria patients during acute attacks. Abnormalities of zinc and/or copper metabolism have occurred 1235c,1360 in patients with the cutanea tarda hereditaria variety. These studies led to the use of chelating agents like ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and British antilewisite (BAL) as antidotes for these conditions. Although these therapeutic regimens were claimed to be successful, data relating porphyria and its underlying abnormalities to trace metal metabolism were not clear enough to establish how trace metals 1171a may affect this disease. Indeed, conflicting data were presented, and whether abnormalities of metal metabolism are involved in the etiology of porphyria at all is still being disputed. 925a Levine et al. studied the zinc metabolism of patients with several types of porphyria. They found that after histidine was administered, the half-time of orally administered zinc-65 shortened significantly, which demonstrated a total body loss of the metal. They also found that during histidine administration, urinary excretion of various porphyrins decreased, 668,679 although urinary zinc excretion increased. This previously observed decreased in excreted porphyrin c was related by Levine et al. to the 2 26*i specific action of histidine on the zinc requirement ' of 6-ALA synthetase, the critical enzyme controlling the rate of porphyrin Histidine administration dramatically lowered the urinary porphyrin excre- tion to or toward normal in each patient studied. The role of histidine was found to be useful in reducing urinary porphyrin excretion in these patients. a 2,265 Because zinc is a component of 6-aminolevulinic acid dehydiatase in several species, it is possible that abnormalities of zinc metabolism may influence the synthesis of porphyrins. 363 image: ------- THERAPEUTIC USES OF ZINC Wound Healing 515,1410a,1584 Zinc plays an important role in protein synthesis. It is essential for the normal activity of DNA polymerase and is present in 1462 RNA polymerase. Zinc also appears to influence the synthesis of 729 collagen. Removing zinc from DNA polymerase inhibits polymerase activity, whereas complete activity is restored after its incubation with zinc ions. Physiologically, zinc is important to growth and development. Some 108 bacteria require zinc to synthesize several essential amino acids. Zinc 1523 is also an essential nutrient for higher plants. Animals on zinc-deficient diets develop anorexia, hypogeusia, growth retardation, and various skin 270,271,1004 dystrophies. Each sign of zinc deficiency found in animals has also been reported in man, although the relationship between zinc deficiency and the abnormalities observed have often been difficult to specify. 364 image: ------- These biochemical and physiologic observations indicate the impor- tance of zinc to cell division in several systems of different species. Therefore, it is not surprising that zinc would affect any system under- going rapid cellular division, such as a healing wound. Such an obser- vation was made in apparently healthy men undergoing surgical excision of 1262,1263,1265 pilonidal cysts. In this study, conducted without the benefit of systematic controls, orally administered zinc was claimed to accelerate the healing rate of surgical wounds. Zinc may accelerate healing because zinc pools shift radically after an operation. In the postoperative or wounded period, more zinc is necessary to promote protein synthesis, collagen formation, or the incorporation of zinc into enzyme systems. Radioactive zinc has been found to concentrate in healing tissue, and highest levels have been found immediately after 1418 injury. The greatest activity of zinc in wound healing has been sug- gested to occur during epithelization when the large store of zinc in the 1265 skin may be a convenient source of the metal. Zinc has been shown to preferentially concentrate in healing tissues, with peak levels reached 1418 the third day after injury. Serum and urine zinc have been reported to be lower than normal in 1 patients with bedsores and interpreted to reflect the depleted body zinc 295 of these patients. Oral zinc sulfate has been said to promote healing. Zinc given to animals to aid wound healing is not consistently effective 1054,1058,1096,1411 in increasing the healing rate. These studies in animals 75a,291b,559a,1102b and in man cast doubt on claims that zinc is influ- ential in wound healing. 365 image: ------- 75a 295 504c Other controlled and uncontrolled studies ' ' have been performed to evaluate the claims that zinc accelerates the healing rate of surgical wounds. Single- and double-blind studies involving oral admin- istration of zinc and placebo have been carried out in man and animals and have 291b,559a,762a,1102b,1305b,1471a produced conflicting results. Some verified v 559a,762a, the efficacy of zinc in accelerating the rate of wound healing. 1265,1305b,l471a 75a,291b,lK)2b Others did not. But if zinc plays such an important role in cell division and protein synthesis, how can the negative results be explained? These studies are problematic. How can the rate or end point of the healing process be established to the equal satisfaction of different investi- gators? The absorption of oral zinc by humans is variable-dependent upon several factors, including the counterion used and the nutritional status of the patient? the results of different studies cannot always be compared directly. Evalua- tion of the results may also be difficult because human zinc absorption is slow and variable during the first few weeks of oral intake. As long as 6-8 wk may be required before some aspects of bodily changes in zinc metabolism can be measured. Although no definitive answers have been found, a double-blind study was reported in which the effects of zinc and placebo were studied on the rate of 605 healing of venous leg ulcers. If all data from that study were pooled and the total results analyzed, no significant difference would be found between zinc and placebo in accelerating the rate of wound healing. However, when patients with lower concentrations of serum zinc were evaluated as a group, a statistically significant acceleration of the rate of 366 image: ------- healing was demonstrated, whereas no differences could be shown in patients with what investigators considered normal concentrations of serum zinc. Similar outcomes (that is, open to two interpretations) were also demonstrated in zinc-deficient rats and rats on diets supplemented 1411 with zinc. These results suggest that zinc aids wound healing in zinc-deficient states, but not in states where zinc is adequate. If these latter studies are confirmed, the only problem would be to identify 367 image: ------- the patient or subject group at risk. Unfortunately, this latter task is simpler to state than to solve. In rats on a zinc-deficient diet, the serum zinc concentration may be an adequate 1522 index of --' zinc deficiency. However, in humans, serum zinc concentration may not - . accurately reflect the status of total body zinc metabolism. Acute or chronic infectious processes, anemias, various drugs, liver diseases, malignancy and other pathologic processes may depress the concentration of serum zinc and affect a redistribution of body zinc pools, yet not necessarily produce a total body zinc loss or a state of zinc deficiency. How then is the patient at risk to be readily Identified? No simple answer exists although several approaches are possible. The clinical ideal would be a simple, direct method of assessing total body zinc status with one quick and easy test. Since assessing status of the serum zinc pool may be misleading, measurement of urinary zinc excretion along with it may be helpful. However, this index also must be used cautiously, for during decreased food intake or starvation human serum zinc concentration may be normal, whereas urinary zinc excretion may be quite elevated. Any bodily process which involves the breakdown or rapid turnover of cells is 1532 1537 associated with increased urinary zinc excretion, ' changes which may or may not be reflected in serum zinc concentration. Since mobilization of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is associated with decreased serum zinc concentration and increased urinary zinc excretion, stress from any significant source, including surgery itself, could be manifested by a redistribution of body zinc and a transient zinc loss, both of which may be evident for a few days. Measurement of hair zinc is relatively simple but it does not reflect 368 image: ------- the dynamic changes inherent in body zinc metabolism. Measurement of salivary 678 zinc may offer a direct index of total body zinc, but too little is known about this new technique. Administering zinc to zinc-deficient humans or animals may well correct the numerous defects produced by the deficiency. The mechanisms by which these abnormalities are corrected are multiple, and they are related to the specifics of the several organ systems affected by the deficiency state. However, /the incidence of zinc deficiency in man has not been established clearly, and it as in most disease states, /is represented by a spectrum of severity. Secondary effects of zinc, unrelated to net total body zinc loss, also may be important, particularly in organ systems which metabolize rapidly. If the role of zinc in cell division and wound healing in man is to be comprehended, changes in the intake, absorption, excretion and distribution of zinc, as well as the many biochemical, physiologic and pathologic factors which influence the dynamic nature of these processes will have to be evaluated carefully. States of Zinc Deficiency Clinical zinc deficiencies in humans have been related to zinc malabsorption caused by gastrointestinal diseases of several etiologies, 150a,214a,998a, 1412,1522 decreased zinc intake> loss of f , 296,899a,899b,899c,1793a TT , rich fluids. Urinary losses following hepatic and 309a,720a, renal damage, the effects of certain drugs, excessive perspiration, 1288 ' or some combinations of these phenomena also may be responsible for zinc deficiency. Whatever the etiology, clinical symptoms of anorexia 369 image: ------- taste and wnell abnornialities have been considered early signs of Insufficient 673,679 zinc. Taste and Appetite Disorders fi 70 The role of zinc in appetite has been studied in normal subjects, and 679 those with scleroderma or malignancies. After zinc was depleted by L-histi- dine administration, anorexia uniformly developed as the first symptom associated with zinc loss. Appetite returned to normal after oral zinc administration. * In some patients with malignancy and cachexia, treatment with zinc ion has been useful in obviating some of the more severe effects of anorexia; in others with idiopathic hypogeusia and anorexia, oral administration of zinc ion is useful in ..... --it-t. -t.i_ j 681. 1420b _ , obviating anorexia if the hypogeusia has been corrected. In the rat t anorexia and a marked cyclic pattern of food intake also developed as the first symptoms of zinc deficiency and these symptoms were the first corrected even with 270 the administration of very small amounts of zinc. 615,617,620a,621,679,1522 Acute or chronic zinc deficiency or loss in humans 1004 and animals has been accompanied by anorexia, hypogeusia and hyposmia. As noted above, anorexia is the initial symptom in all species. The symptoms of 678 hypogeusia, hyposmia, dysgeusia and dysosmia have been shown to develop later. Oral administration of zinc to human patients with acutely induced zinc deficiency abolished the dysgeusia and dysosmia and restored taste and smell acuity to or toward normal in each patient so affected. Changes in human taste acuity were related to the diminution of the recently isolated par otic zinc protein, gustin, which has a molecular weight of 37,000 daltons and contains 8% histidine and 2 moles of zinc I mole of protein. This protein is present in subjects with 370 image: ------- normal taste acuity but has been shown to be decreased in patients with various types of taste dysfunction.674 Because this protein contains zinc and is the major zinc-containing protein in saliva,674 measuring salivary zinc excretion from the parotid gland may be a convenient way to obtain information about the C6ntration of this protein in parotid saliva. '^?&'\u00b0 Decreased zinc concentration in parotid saliva often reflects decreases in salivary gustin 674 concentration; this change in turn is commonly associated with anatomic ab- normalities in the taste buds. The pore area of the bud is disrupted by several pathologic processes, but they may be observed systematically only with the use of transmission electron microscopy. Pathologic conditions may be reflected by several anatomic and functional abnormalities. In patients who lack saliva, e.g., patients with xero- stomia from Sjogren's syndrome or fatty parotid syndrome, there is a decrease in taste acuity (hypogeusia), and in those taste buds that can be found, the pore area of the bud is disrupted. Treatment of these patients with drugs or x-irra- diatioa\u00bb in whom salivary flow was restored to or toward normal, was accompanied by the restoration of normal taste bud anatomy and taste acuity to or toward nor- 684 . .* mal. Patients with untreated Sjogren's syndrome and hypogeusia do not exhibit decreased levels of salivary zinc; rather they have normal levels of parotid salivary zinc but apparently too little salivary secretion to support normal taste bud function. The salivary flow rate of patients with idiopathic hypogeusia (i.e., taste loss related to unknown or unexplained factors) is normal, but taste acuity is impaired. ' * Their taste bud anatomy is altered in a manner grossly similar to that observed in patients with xerostomia \u2014 the pore area of the taste bud is markedly disrupted and the normal cell types exhibit cytologic pathology. In some patients with idiopathic hypogeusia, analysis of parotid saliva revealed lower than normal levels of zinc and gustin. 674,678 371 image: ------- Treatment with zinc ion in a single-blind study restored taste acuity and taste bud anatomy to or toward normal in some patients with idiopathic hypogeusia, and in both single-and double-blind studies, concomitant parotid sali- 673a,674,678,681 vary zinc and parotid gustin concentrations were observed. For other patients not only was zinc ion ineffective in restoring taste acuity and taste bud anatomy to or toward normal, but also their parotid salivary gustin concentrations 673a did not increase. Placebo treatment was also effective for some patients, as noted later, and ineffective for others in restoring taste acuity to or toward normal 673a as observed in a double-blind study. No systematic studies have yet been pub- lished in which the nature of metabolic or other changes in these patients improved by placebo have been ascertained. The rationale for treating patients with idiopathic hypogeusia with zinc ion lay in empirical observations of taste and smell dysfunction and abnormalities 682a,683 of zinc metabolism among patients with acute viral hepatitis, and in women during the first trimester of their pregnancies. In both of these groups, taste and smell dysfunction returned to or toward normal when zinc metabolism returned to or toward normal with the waning of the hepatitis or the progression and subsequent termination of the pregnancy. In a single-blind study of the influence of zinc ion and placebo in treating patients with taste dysfunction of several etiologies, a statistically 681 significant effect of zinc ion was measured. In addition, hypozincemia was observed among these patients, reinforcing the.hypothesis of an abnormal zinc metabolism. In a subsequent double-blind study in a similar group of patients, both placebo and zinc ion were equivalent in ' restoring taste acuity to or toward normal. Reevaluation of the double-blind study, carried out in the same manner as the single-blind study, suggested that the order in which the drugs were given affected the results of the study. Thus, zinc therapy is clearly not effective in the treatment of unselected patients with taste disorders. 372 image: ------- Although taste dysfunction has been described as a common accompani- ment of zinc deficiency states and treatment with zinc ion has been shown to correct the abnormalities of the deficiency, including those of taste and smell dysfunction, patients with changes in taste and smell function do not always exhibit abnormalities of zinc metabolism. As noted, available data indicate that placebo therapy cannot be differentiated from therapy with zinc in the correction of taste and smell dysfunction of diverse etiologies. The confusion between zinc deficiency in which taste loss is a symptom, and taste loss, which may be related to a variety of factors, is compounded by the lower than normal mean serum levels of zinc observed in patients with taste and smell dysfunction when measured as a - . 673a,681,1420b . group. Before the double-blind study carried out by 7O Henkin and his associates, it was assumed that most patients with taste and smell dysfunction exhibited an abnormality of body zinc metabolism because of their low serum values. This hypothesis was buttressed by the finding of decreased alkaline phosphatase in leukocytes of patients with hypogeusia participating in the double-blind study. However, these findings may not reflect total body zinc loss. In a study of the oral absorption of zinc-65 in 13 patients with hypogeusia and hyposmia, three groups of patients were tentatively identified. ' Six patients absorbed 65\u00b1 4%(mean - I SEM) of the zinc-65, a value 950a 1345c similar to that reported ' for normal subjects. Five patients absorbed 22 t 5% of the dose given, a value similar to that reported as indicative of zinc malabsorption. This value is similar to that absorbed by patients with untreated acrodermatitis enteropathica. Two patients 373 image: ------- absorbed 99 - 1% of the administered dose. Athough the mean level of serum zinc in all 13 patients was lower than normal, only 30% ,i m n exhibited apparent zinc malabsorption. The role of zinc in the taste system has been investigated in several studies. Taste bud-enriched membranes have been isolated from bovine circumvallate papillae. As these membranes were purified, the activity of alkaline phosphatase, a zinc-dependent enzyme, was significantly enhanced and found to be the major enzyme of the purified membranes. In addition, the specific binding of several tastants to these purified membranes was inhibited by EDTA but rose toward normal QC QU by adding zinc ion. The saliva and mucus secretions from the small gut of zinc-deficient sheep and rats are also different from their normal counterparts and these secretions return to normal when zinc ion is provided. Color Blindness Michaelson noted that in patients with acroderraatitis enteropatuica whose color blindness was induced from optic atrophy after diiodohydroxquin treatment, zinc restored color vision to normal. The visual cones may be sensitive to zinc deficiency and thus zinc might influence the visual process. Treatment of Laryngeal Granulomas Granulomas of the larynx arise from several etiologies and often are difficult to manage. Since repeated surgical removal may be compli- cated by repeated regrowth of this tissue, narrowing of the laryngeal airway, and other surgical problems, a chemical method of treatment has been sought. Oral administration of zinc has been reported to be 374 image: ------- useful therapy. \u00b05' 1305a\u00bb 13<>5b The specific relationship between zinc therapy and the occasional complete disappearance of these lesions is not clear at present, although the rationale for its use is based on the hypothesis that zinc accelerates the healing of wounds.1*18 Skin and Epithelial Tissue Locally applied and orally ingested zinc has been used to treat several skin disorders. Topical application of calamine, an impure zinc oxide, was described as early as 1550 BC. Calamine is still widely used as a pro- prietary preparation to treat many skin disorders and zinc oxide itself has been prescribed by dermatologists for many years. Zinc is chief constituent of many common proprietary agents, including talcum powders and skin creams. Zinc stearate, oleate, and sulfate solutions are main ingredients in talcums and creams. Zinc has also been claimed 296 to rejuvenate hair .and skin. Dilute solutions of zinc sulfate and acetate are components of eye washes prescribed to treat conjunctivitis; and they are sometimes applied as ancillary aids in the management of urethritis. Zinc peroxide pastes are commonly-used in the treatment of skin ulcers, especially sores that are complications of varicose veins or vascular insuffi- ciency of the lower extremities. 1 Cardiovascular Disorders Abnormalities of zinc metabolism in several disorders, including hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and Raynaud's phenomenon have been directly 685b,686 or indirectly related to the pathogeneses of those disorders. Treat- ment with zinc ion has been used to reverse the abnormalities observed in 686a, 1261,1557a atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The validity of these impressions remain to be clearly established, because clinical trials have claimed that zinc not been controlled. It has been / improves local blood flow to ischemic 375 image: ------- 686 areas in patients with impaired circulation to the leg; this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested yet. However, zinc-65 appears to deposit preferentially in rapidly proliferating tissue, particularly areas undergoing 685a,843a rapid healing. Routes of Zinc Administration* lu general, when zinc is administered to animals or humans, it is given 1262,1263,1265 by the oral route. Effectiveness of oral absorption depends upon the many factors noted in Chapters 7 and 8. At present, sulfate is the only approved, easily available counterlon for pharmacologic zinc therapy in the United 1647 States. Nevertheless, this compound is poorly absorbed and one of the more toxic of 1'ie available zinc compounds. Oral administration of zinc sulfate may be associated with gastrointestinal toxicosis in some subjects. The Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of zinc only as an emetic for humans. Thus, administration of significant amounts of oral zinc is limited by this side effect. The pharmacology of oral zinc administration and subsequent blood and tissue levels have not been studied systematically. Similarly, pulmonary inhalation of zinc and subsequent changes in blood and tissue levels have not been carefully investigated. Since zinc is used to treat diverse disorders, its pharmacology is of immediate and practical interest to physicians and veterinarians. * Because of the limited state of knowledge and the preference for oral administration, intravenous and other kinds of parenteral administration of zinc will not be discussed. However, these routes have become more important in treating some clinical conditions, particularly in patients undergoing long-term hyperalimentation.615 ' 376 image: ------- CHAPTER 11 TOXICITY OF ZINC HUMANS Ingestion, Inhalation, and Absorption Acute effects. Apart from effects of inhaling zinc fumes encountered during some types of industrial exposure, it is apparent that zinc, especially from oral ingest ion, is not very toxic to humans. There are a few sparse reports of accidental exposure of humans to food or drink contaminated with high levels of zinc. However, these reports are problematic because it is difficult to determine whether the alleged zinc toxicosis was caused by the zinc ger s_e or by some impurity associated with the metal, particularly cadmium. In addition, the literature is old and lacks present day confirmation. Acute onset of gastrointestinal distress and diarrhea was reported to follow ingest ion of lemonade prepared in galvanized iron garbage cans for military per- 222 sonnel stationed in Panama. Zinc absorbed into the acidic beverage was sus- pected of being responsible for this outbreak of diarrhea, and use of galvanized iron utensils for preparing or serving food or drink was subsequently prohibited by the Army Medical Research Board. Another incident was reported in which several people became ill, apparently with food poisoning, from food eaten which had been 173 cooked and/or held in galvanized containers. Storing food, particularly acid foods such as citrus punches, in galvanized containers may bring about consider- able zinc contamination. An even less well documented report was a letter which described a couple who drank water containing 40 ppm zinc from a galvanized pipe. They became irritable, and suffered difficulty in concentrating, drowsiness, cloudiness of thinking, mental fatigue, and headaches. A diagnosis of zinc toxicosis was only suggested by the nonspecific symptomatology and the couple was said to have improved upon change in water supply. 377 image: ------- More recent reports suggest that ingested zinc is toxic to humans only in very high dose levels that break down the homeostatic mechanisms 124 controlling zinc uptake and excretion. Eighteen patients were given a daily dose of 660 mg zinc sulfate for 16-26 wk for treatment of venous leg ulcerations. No evidence of hematologic, hepatic, or renal toxicosis from zinc was found in any of these patients. It was reported that a 16-yr-old boy ingested 12 g of elemental zinc in 2 days to hasten healing of a minor laceration. In 3 days he developed a lethargy that progressed for 5 more days. He complained of light-headedness, and exhibited a slightly staggering gait and difficulty in writing. These effects were accompanied by an elevated blood zinc concentration and increased 1094 serum amylase and lipase, suggesting a pancreatic effect. A patient on home hemodialysis experienced nausea, vomiting and fever, allegedly from zinc toxicosis that developed when the metal contaminated the water stored in the galvanized tank of her dialysis unit. Plasma and 520 red blood cell zinc concentrations were elevated. Chronic effects. Whether long terra or chronic ingest ion of excessive zinc in humans is associated with adverse health effects is debatable. A syndrome consisting of gastrointestinal symptoms which include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort, and weight loss was described in workmen in a galvanizing plant as characteristic of excessive exposure , . 1006 or zinc. However, simultaneous exposure to other potentially toxic substances also occurred, so that identification of zinc as the principal toxic substance is uncertain. 378 image: ------- Another report suggests occupational exposure to zinc oxide fumes at concentrations ranging from 3-15 mg/m3 for 2-35 yr may not affect health 84 adversely. Increases in blood zinc and zinc content of gastric secretions were found in furnace operators who were chronically exposed to zinc 622 oxide fumes in a brass foundry in Egypt. The increased zinc concentration in gastric secretion might account for the reported gastric complaints, notably epigastric pain after food intake. Radiography detected no pathologic changes in stomach or duodenum in the four workers studied by this technique. On the basis of a single case report, it has been suggested that chronic inhalation of zinc stearate powder may produce chronic pneumo- coniosis.1145 Some observations of children have suggested that excessive oral intake of zinc might be more widespread than previously suspected. For example, toy cars made with zinc are often placed in warm bath water along with soap. Because of the high pH, this environment would be conducive for high concentrations of zinc to leach out of the toy into the bath water. Children do drink bath water, and this chain of events has been reported to precipi- tate the lethargy, fatigue and acute hemolytic anemia of some children 284 observed in hospital. Their serum zinc concentrations were elevated, as was the amount of zinc excreted in their urine. Excessive intake of zinc in the form of zinc supplements given to aid healing of wounds has produced lethargy in children, along with high levels of blood zinc.10^* A severe porotic effect of oral zinc on bone also may result, especially if dietary calcium is low.463 Other investigators 251 have noted that oral zinc supplementation is not without medical consequences. 379 image: ------- Metgl Fume Fever^ Metal fume fever is defined as an acute disability of short duration that occurs when fume is inhaled from metal heated to a temperature above its melting point. Clinical features as well as the pathogenesis of the syndrome have been summarized.177,751,829,1555 ^e disorder has been most commonly associated with inhalation of zinc oxide fume, but it may be seen after fumes of other metals are inhaled, particularly magnesium, iron, and copper. But metal fume fever is most severe among brass founders and the higher the proportion of zinc, the more severe are the symptoms. Clinical signs and symptoms occur within 4-8 h of exposure. They are characterized by hyperpnea, shivering with fever, profuse sweating, pain in the chest and legs, and general weakness. An attack is usually sliort--lasting only 24-48 h--and accompanied by leukocytosis. One of v the more intesting aspects of this disorder is that a second exposure to the metallic fumes within 48 h will produce little or no response, but if the second exposure comes after a lapse of 48 h or more, an attack is likely. This is best demonstrated in workmen who suffer fresh attacks on a Monday following a weekend away from exposure. However, if the individual continues to be exposed daily, he does not become ill again. The word \"tachyphylaxis,\" meaning \"quick immunity,\" has been applied to this phenomenon. Although metal fume fever was said to be recognized as long ago as 1822 by the French physician, Potissier,751 complete understanding of the role of zinc in the pathogenesis of the syndrome is still not available. McCord refers to metal fume fever as the foremost scientific enigma 380 image: ------- of industrial toxicology. Several theories have been advanced to explain the observed features of the disorder but few of these notions have received experimental support. One appealing hypothesis is that inhaled zinc fume has a direct chemical toxicity to alveolar and capillary epithelium, which brings about an acute inflammatory response and consequent exudation. Fume fever, the systemic reaction, may occur because protein produced by breakdown of polyraorphonuclear neutrophils pours into the circulation. This concept is a slight variation of an earlier proposal*1^ that the inhaled zinc produces pulmonary bacteriolysis. Proteins released from the lysed bacteria are pyrogenic. A more recent study suggests that protein released from cell breakdown serves as an endogenous pyrogen. Extracts prepared from tracheal mucosa and lungs of animals with experimentally induced metal fume fever have T631 produced similar symptoms when injected into other animals. McCord suggested that the effects of zinc on respiratory tract tissues result in the formation of an allergen and eventually to an antigen- antibody, or hypersensitivity reaction. The thesis is intriguing but it has not been proved. Also, one might expect eosinophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes to increase significantly as part of the peripheral leukocytesis occurring in the disorder, but apparently no such process occurs. Another experimental approach has been to reproduce the disorder in animals by spraying blood serum into a zinc oxide cloud, and collecting and injecting this material into animals. It also was claimed that the syndrome could be induced by the subcutaneous or intravenous administration OnT of zinc salts, but this method has not been repeated or verified. In fact, there is little or no evidence to suggest that metal fume fever is a direct result of systemically absorbed zinc jger_se\u00ab 381 image: ------- Some of the most detailed clinical and experimental studies of the pathogenesis of metal fume fever here conducted by Drinker and his associates 398 399 402 between 30 and 40 years ago. ' ' It was demonstrated that an initial respiratory exposure to zinc fume at 52 mg zinc/m air was capable of inducing metal fume fever in human subjects, although later exposure to higher concentrations within 24 h had no further effect. They believed then and it was more recently contended by some ' that freshly formed fumes composed of very small particles from 0.05-0.5 ym are necessary to cause the disorder. As fumes age, they tend to agglomerate and become less reactive. Larger particles tend to settle out or become entrapped higher in the respiratory tract. 2 399 Drinker and Drinker also produced clinical metal fume fever in cats, rats and rabbits by exposing them to high concentrations (600 mg zinc/nr air) of zinc oxide fumes. Within 1 or 2 h the animals exhibited an initial decrease in body temperature followed by fever. They also demonstrated that the highest concentrations of zinc in these animals after pulmonary exposure were in pancreas, liver and gallbladder, a phenomenon similar to that found after the feeding of a single dose (0.175-1.0 g) of zinc oxide. They also learned that elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, perhaps because it increased depth of respiration, increased the severity of experimentally induced metal fume fever. It has been shown that the inhalation toxicity of catalytically active zinc oxide dust is increased markedly by. ultraviolet radiation.9^1 876 Krause demonstrated that inhaling zinc inhibited red blood cell carbonic anhydrase activity; the level of inhibition correlated with zinc. Similar inhibition followed inhalation of 382 image: ------- magnesium oxide, a metal that also produces metal fume fever. He suggested that inhibition of carbonic anhydrase was the actual cause of metal fume fever, but beyond demonstration of the association, the rationale for this notion was not discussed. Reasons for the transient tolerance or immunity of experimental animals and exposed workers to metal fume fever also remains unexplained. Drinker observed that the period of immunity or tolerance seems to parallel the period of the leukocytosis. It also must be considered whether or not the symptoms of metal fume fever that seem to be caused by the metallurgy of zinc are actually arising from the presence of a metal contaminant, such as arsenic, cadmium, manganese, lead, chromium, or silver. Apart from the knowledge that the syndrome may be contracted from exposure to other forms of metal fume, particularly manganese oxide, there is no other information implicating these 697 metals. Moreover, a similar syndrome (cotton-mill fever, or byssinosis) occurs among cotton mill workers, presumably from exposure to a foreign QC/: protein in cotton dust. Therefore, it can be said that exposure to finely divided zinc dust will produce a disorder described as metal fume fever. The pathologic mechanisms Involved In the expression of the syndrome are not yet defined. The syndrome may be produced by other forms of metal fume or protein-containing dusts. ANIMALS Animals are quite tolerant of high levels of zinc in the diet. Levels 100 times that required in the diet usually do not cause any detectable 383 image: ------- symptoms of toxicosis. Part of any observed toxicosis is caused by the decreased food consumption that accompanies the feeding of high zinc diets; interference with copper and iron absorption and metabolism is probably also responsible for toxicosis.16^0 High zinc ingestion frequently affects the joints of animals fed such a diet; this effect is probably not from inter- ference with food intake or copper and iron metabolism, and may be related to the increased level of zinc in the bones of animals fed excess zinc. The adverse effects of high levels of dietary zinc on bone have been reported 'els of zii 1051,1198 464 to be aggravated in the presence of low calcium intake. Levels of zinc as high as 600 ppm in the diet have not been reflected in hair.' Elevated plasma zinc coupled with low plasma copper has been suggested as a reliable indicator of chronic zinc intoxication. Horse Reports of lameness and death In young horses raised in the vicinity of lead-zinc smelters prompted a study of lead and zinc toxicosis in young 1786 horses. Growth rates of animals fed zinc decreased after intake exceeded 90 mg/kg body weight/day. Enlargement at the epiphyseal region of the long bones was the first clinical sign noted, and it occurred in all animals between 20-30 wk. These swellings were followed by stiffness, reluctance to walk and turn, lameness, and reluctance to stand. The growth of animals receiving lead was similar to that of controls until signs of illness appeared. Animals that received both lead and zinc had lower levels of lead in bones but higher levels in liver and kidney than did those fed only lead. They did not, 384 image: ------- however, have the neurologic dysfunction associated with the high levels of lead. Another report of illness in foals in the vicinity of a smelter was diagnosed as lead toxicosis, 31 but the symptoms are more like those described for the horses given either high levels of zinc or of zinc and lead. Since zinc in grasses was as high as 1,100 ppm and 3,500 ppm in overwintered grass, it is likely that the condition resulted from the high levels of zinc as well as lead. Since a foal affected the summer before the study was undertaken was still stiff the next summer, it would appear that horses do not recover once they have been affected, although here the animal was still eating the contaminated forage. Older horses and cattle in the area were not affected. A German study in which similar involvement of bone joints was found in foals pasturing near metalworks with large lead and zinc emissions 754 indicated that cattle were also affected at times, although not as severely. If not too severe, damage to the joint was apparently reversible; but both horses and cattle were likely to suffer other complications which decreased their usefulness for breeding. Swine A zinc-lead interaction has also been demonstrated in growing pigs. Zinc (0.4% of the diet) increased lead (0.1% of the diet) toxicosis when 728 fed over 15 wk. The toxicity was greater with low levels of calcium-phosphorus in the diet. (Zinc interferes with development and mineralization of bone by decreasing calcium and phosphorus content as well as reducing the calciumiphosphorus ratio.1391) Enlargement and 385 image: ------- softening of epiphyseal ends of the humerus and femur were reported in young pigs receiving milk piped through galvanized iron piping and attributed to 568 high levels of zinc in the milk. In swine overdosed with dietary zinc (0.4%), zinc levels in the liver increased, whereas hepatic iron decreased markedly and copper remained unchanged.328 Pigs fed levels of zinc alone up to 500 or 1,000 ppm for several weeks showed no significant difference in weight gain.61'1640 Ruminants Calves fed 600 ppm zinc for 7-21 days showed no sign of toxicosis although zinc levels in pancreas, liver, and kidney were strikingly elevated.1051'1060'1544 Lactating dairy cows receiving 1,300 ppm zinc for 6 wk did not have a greater increase of zinc in their milk than cows on a 700 ppm zinc diet. Moreover, feed containing 1,300 ppm did not produce any discernible changes in health or milk production. Levels around 1,000 ppm appear to be approaching toxic levels for lambs and feeder cattle, however. Levels of this order have been found in mixed pasture herbage downwind of possible zinc sources. Grasses grown in an area in which a smelter previously had operated had levels of 600 ppm. ^ The greater toxicity to ruminants may be accountable to adverse effects on rumen microorganisms, since cellulose digestion by rumen bacteria in vitro 825 981 was reduced by zinc concentrations of 10-20 yg/ml. ' The effect varied 825 to some extent with the protein source. Cows that accidentally ingested a very large dose C20,000 ppm) of zinc oxide contracted severe enteritis and prostration, and some fatalities followed.20 386 image: ------- Poultry Mallard ducks fed high levels of zinc suffered severe paralysis; some ducks were unable to walk after 30 days.52* The lowest level fed them was 3,000 ppm, but even at this level food consumption decreased. At higher levels consumption was reduced to the point that none of the groups received as much zinc in a 30-day period as did those on the 3,000 ppm intake. The high mortality in the groups receiving over 3,000 ppm zinc may have been caused primarily by decreased feed intake. Addition of 3,000 ppm zinc to a corn-soybean meal ration significantly reduced growth in chickens, too. Only a slight reduction occurred in growth with 2,000 ppm, >1351 and taking chicks off the high zinc diets brought about weight gains during the next 6 wk equal to that of the 796 controls. When given in a sucrose-fishmeal diet, 2,000 ppm zinc did impair growth, but this diet did not support normal growth even 96 with control levels of zinc. Mortality from Salmonella galUnarum was 702 not affected by 2,000 ppm zinc in the diet. Growth in turkey poults was 1700 reduced slightly by 4,000 ppm zinc but not by 2,000 ppm. Cat and Dog Cats fed daily doses of zinc oxide between 150-600 mg and dogs given 400 500-1,000 mg daily for periods from 3 wk to 1 yr showed no sign of damage. Although in this experiment cats did not reject the food until the zinc oxide concentration was greater than 600 mg, other investigators found that cats either rejected or vomited a diet containing more than 300 mg zinc oxide. After 12-16 wk on a diet containing 300 mg zinc oxi^p, cats lost weight and exhibited marked fibrotic changes in the pancreas as well , 1458 as a decrease in pancreas size. 38,7 image: ------- Dogs given 4 rag zinc g]ucc-nate/kg body weight intravenously developed it CO lassitude, enteritis, and paresis of the hind legs. Their electrocardio- grams recorded changes similar to those charted in cases of potassium intoxication. Rat and Rabbit The rat can tolerate very high levels of dietary zinc; the median 223 lethal dose of ingested zinc for rats is 350 rag/kg body weight. A level of 2,000 ppm in the food during gestation and lactation had little effect on either dams or offspring. ' Feeding 5,000 ppm during gestation did not affect maternal weight or number of viable offspring, although fetal gOQ weights and weights of 14-day-old pups were decreased. If females were fed 5,000 ppm from weaning, however, their litter size was reduced, and most of the offspring were born dead. Feeding 4,000 ppm for 3 wk before mating also reduced litter size. In another study, however, females that received 7,000 ppm zinc from weaning were able to maintain pregnancy, although 457 litter size was reduced and only 50% of the fetuses were viable. If 4,000 ppm were fed during lactation, the pups had increased zinc and decreased iron 281 and copper in the liver. To sorae extent the hepatic condition was a reflection of the higher zinc level (approximately three times normal) and lower copper and 280 iron levels in the milk; but since the pups had access to the dam's diet, the pups' ingestion of the high zinc diet probably was responsible for much of the change in mineral levels. Consumption of high zinc diets accounted for decreased copper con- centration in some tissues, particularly liver. Interference with copper metabolism was reflected in lessened activity of cytochrome oxidase and 1687 catalase. Enzymatic activities returned to normal in both liver and 407 heart if the high zinc diets were supplemented with copper. In young rats 388 image: ------- liver copper was reduced on a 2,000 ppm zinc diet more than it had been 1761 on a 1,000 ppm diet. Zinc concentration in liver, kidney, and spleen was much higher with 2,000 ppm zinc in the diet than with 10-1,000 ppm.266 Intake .of a high zinc:copper ratio (40:1) has been reported to cause 858 hypercholesterolemia In rats. High zinc:copper ratios were therefore suggested to be of concern in human diets because of the association of hypercholesteroleraia with heart disease. ' The hypercholesterolemia in rats, however, may have been caused by copper deficiency because the level of ingested copper was quite low. Since zinc and copper are antagonistic in several aspects of metabolism, a a high zinc:copper ratio may induce copper deficiency when copper levels are low, but have no effect when they are higher. For instance, zinc:copper ratios of 10:1 and 20:1 reduced 1099 weight gain in weanling rats at a copper level of 1 ppm but not at 2 ppm. Even with a low level of copper in the diet, a zinc:copper ratio of approxi- mately 20:1 did not Increase serum cholesterol in weanling male rats fed the 442 diet for 4 wk. Supplementing infant formula with a zinc:copper ratio of 1799 17:1 for 6 mo did not increase serum cholesterol. Zinc sulfate injected 1560 subcutaneously reduced serum cholesterol in adult rabbits. Zinc was given in drinking water (35-50 mg/day) to rabbits on control diets and on atherogenic (cholesterol-supplemented) diets. Rabbits fed the atherogenic diet showed decreased serum zinc levels and.compared to controls, zinc 472 concentration in their aortas was reduced. High levels of zinc in the diet decreased fat content in the liver of-young rats on a high fat-low protein diet.1391 Cardiovascular lesions have been linked to copper deficiency in the rabbit. In rats, excess zinc decreases cytochrome oxidase activity of the heart, but 389 image: ------- 969 copper supplementation will restore cardiac oxidase activity to normal or greater than normal.^07 Similarly, high dietary levels of zinc markedly decrease liver catalase and cytochrome oxidase activities, but they return 1 687 to normal with addition of copper. \u00b0\u00b0* However, copper deficiency in Americans appears to be extremely rare. Since no evidence exists of marginal copper deficiency in the general population of this country, there is no reason to expect high zinc: copper ratios in the diet to cause hypercholestero- lemia. In pregnant rats and their offspring, high levels of dietary zinc 281 also reduced iron concentrations in some tissues, ' ' but that effect was less marked and more variable \"\u00bb\"'\u00bb than the effect on copper. In young rats, 4,000-7,500 ppm zinc produced a condition resembling iron deficiency anemia and reduced hepatic iron stores. -*^*\u00bb 1516 Supplements of iron plus copper increased hemoglobin concentration to normal levels, 969 although growth remained depressed. A level of 1,200 ppm zinc in the diet of young rats was reported to cause decreased hematocrit, although weight gains were not affected. It would be wise to check animals on high zinc intakes for signs of anemia or copper deficiency even if growth does not appear to be affected. Reports of the effects of zinc on the kidney are sparse. One study suggested that rats given intraperitoneal injections of zinc chloride on alternate days for 10 doses of 2.4 and 4.8 mg/kg body weight would develop histologic changes in renal tubular lining cells. *5/* The nuclei enlarge, and the formation of intranuclear inclusion bodies is reminiscent of the changes that occur in lead or zinc intoxication. Repetition of this experiment In another laboratory failed to produce those changes (R. A. Goyer, personal communication). 390 image: ------- Walters and Roe found no indication that feeding high levels of zinc for as long as 1 yr accounted for any increased incidence of tumors in mice.1726 SUBCELLULAj^ EFFECTS Mitochondria Zinc inhibits concentra- \u20145 752 tions of about 10~;J M. Smaller concentrations induce mitochondrial o / c swelling. Effects of zinc ions on respiratory chain enzymes are complex and depend upon the particular concentration. The most sensitive reactions appear to be nicotinaraide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) reduction with succinate and the electron transfer between cytochromes b_ and c\u00b1. Higher concen- i Zn stimulates energy-linked I n accumulation of Mg in heart mitochondria, an action ordinarily not associated with any irreversible membrane change, implying that the uptake may be a physiologic effect. Lysosomes In an attempt to determine how zinc may beneficially influence various 286 tissue injuries, Chvapil et al. found that zinc stabilizes lysosomal membranes by a mechanism restricted to the surface of the membrane. CARCINOGENESIS. TERATOGENESIS. AND MUTAGENESIS Zinc and Cancer Tumor induction by zinc in experimental animal^. That zinc may induce tumors was first reported by Michalowsky, who produced testicular 391 image: ------- by 5% zinc chloride solution directly beneath the testicular capsule. Tumors developed in only a small percentage of cases. However, spontaneously occurring testicular teratomas occur only rarely.982 Zinc was found to induce testicular tumors in fowl only if the testes were Injected during the months (January-March) when the gonads were active, but they could be induced at other times of the year if the testes were stimulated by prolonged injection of gonadotropins. Injecting testes of Japanese quail with zinc chloride caused few teratomas in organs where gonadal growth was stimulated by manipulation CQQ of the photoperiod. Zinc will not induce tumors in immature testes. 64 2^2 Zinc-induced teratomas do not metastasize, ' and are believed to be derived from anlagen originating in germ cells and resembling reticulum cells. These rests may become trapped in the zinc-induced scars.150\" Zinc-induced teratomas from testes of fowl have been transplanted successfully 39 into subcutaneous tissues and intra-abdominal cavities of other fowl. The transplanted tumors grow rapidly and may invade adjacent skeletal muscle. Injection of other fibrosing substances or irritants have not produced testicular teratomas,1038'10*0 so that zinc per se applied in this manner somehow must provide the tumorigenic stimulus to these cells. Similar tumors may be induced in mammals. Testicular tumors have been produced in rats by intratesticular injection of zinc chloride.1350 Except for the ability to induce testicular teratomas, no experimental evidence exists that zinc administered orally or parenterally is tumorigenic.15 Mice fed diets containing 5,000 ppm zinc as zinc oleate for 3 mo, reduced to 2,500 ppm for 3 mo and then 1,250 ppm for a total time of 1 yr were studied for tumor incidence at 45 wk of age.1726 Dosage was reduced 392 image: ------- because of onset of anemia, weight loss, and death. Hepatoma, malignant lymphoma, and lung adenoma were found in control and experimental groups. Only the number of hepatomas exceeded the number of similar tumors in the control group (7 out of 23:3 out of 24), but these numbers were not believed to be significantly different. Addition of zinc sulfate to drinking water at 5,000 ppm and 1,000 ppm for the same period of time did not increase the incidence of tumors mor growth by zinc. Several studies of experimental animals and observations of humans suggest that the administration of zinc may inhibit tumor growth. The initial suggestion that zinc might have such an effect arose from studies by Bishchoff and Long,*^ who injected virgin Marsh-Buffalo mice aged 2 mo with a predictably high occurrence of spontaneous mammary adenocarcinoma. Seventy-three percent of the control mice in this study developed tumors at age 15 mo, whereas tumors occurred in only 38% of the zinc-injected mice. Similarly, supplementing drinking water with zinc sulfate reduced the incidence of 9,10 dimethyl-l,2-benzanthracene -induced 1 268 tumors in the cheek pouches of golden hamsters. Zinc chloride paste has been found useful in controlling local effects of inoperable breast cancer.152* Tissue zinc levels in humans with malignant disease. There is no available evidence at the present time to suggest that zinc deficiency per se has any etiologic role in human cancer. However, a number of studies have been conducted which indicate change in tissue content of zinc in persons with malignant disease, but it is not possible now to interpret the significance of these changes. Furthermore, results from many of the studies to date appear contradictory. Reasons for the present uncertanties are manifold, 393 image: ------- but variations in analytic methods and cytologic criteria guiding selection of material to be analyzed may be responsible for some of the difficulties. An early report suggested that some neoplasms contain particularly high concentrations of zinc,336 but it is clear now that this does not apply to all cancers. In fact, the converse Is more generally true. Tumors usually contain lower levels of trace metals such as zinc than do non-neoplastic tissues in the same patients,1616'1807 but exceptions may exist for specific tumors. For example, scirrhous carcinoma of the breast and bronchogenic carcinoma may contain increased amounts of zinc. But measuring zinc ope content of pleural fluid cannot distinguish benign and malignant lung diseases. J Prostatic tissue has a particularly strong affinity for zinc,*5 4\u00bb965\u00bb994\u00ab1652 and hyperplastic prostate gland significantly increases in zinc content, whereas carcinomatous portions of prostate decrease in zinc.138'355'593\u00bb709,993,1368,1443 In 1959, it was shown that the zinc level of blood from patients with cancer generally is subnormal; and it has been suggested that the lower serum zinc levels reflect lower levels of red cell carbonic anhydrase. Davies found that 75% of all patients with carcinoma of the bronchus had plasma zinc levels below the normal range. In a larger study of more than 100 patients with bronchial carcinoma of all histologic types, he concluded that most patients with bronchogenic carcinoma have persistent low serum zinc and that 25% of patients with malignancies that do not metastasize have lower than normal plasma zinc. Patients with cancer at other sites do not have low plasma zinc unless they have experienced marked weight loss or have low serum protein levels.360 Others warned that zinc metabolism is inhibited by excessive calcium, cadmium, copper and probably other elements, so that * See also Chapter 7, 394 image: ------- lower plasma zinc levels can only be interpreted when amounts of other trace metals in plasma are determined simultaneously.1556 Lower than normal plasma zinc levels have also been observed In children with untreated leukemia. Plasma copper levels are increased but no correla- tion was found between copper:zinc ratios and total white cell or peripheral blast cell counts. The zinc content of noncancerous portions of liver containing malignant tumor is higher than normal;1171'1807 in one case of acute lymphatic leukemia with hepatic infiltration, the liver showed a 258% increase in zinc, a 301% increase in iron, and a 233% increase in cobalt.1171 Elevation of hepatic zinc levels in persons dying of malignant disease not involving the liver has been found in more recent studies.5^' Morgan et al. reported increasefll liver and kidney zinc in patients with carcinoma of the lung. Three explanations for the increase in hepatic zinc that accompanies malignancy have been postulated: the rise in liver zinc could reflect widespread preraalignant change not peculiar to liver; the rise in liver zinc could be related to the poor nutritional state of patients with cancer; and the rise in liver zinc could be a feature of a chemical defense 566 reaction of normal liver to invasion by malignant cells. Table 11-1 shows the results of the study by Griffith et al.566 that confirmed the increase of liver zinc in apparently normal tissue in subjects dying from cancer. No comparable elevations occurred in kidney, heart, spleen, or pancreas* thus the authors suggested that the first two explanations were Improbable. 395 image: ------- TABLE 11-1 Tis_sue o_l_ Series Standard Tissue8 Liver Kidney Heart Spleen Pancreas Mean D< 837 502 301 169 263 sviation 204 154 98 64 104 Mean 538 505 364 196 291 Deviation 95 rrobabiiity <0.05 >0.49 >0.25 >0.25 >0.30 - Data from Griffith et al. 566 - Zinc values in mg/100 g ashed tissue. Other explanations of the relationship between zinc metabolism and cancer involve the influence of zinc on RNA and DNA metabolism and chelating ability of chemical carcinogens. Zinc Teratogenesis a_nd_Mu_ta_g_ene_si No evidence exists that excessive zinc produces any teratogenic effect, It is of interest, however, that simultaneous administration of zinc with cadmium salts will dramatically reduce the teratogenic effect of cadmium in golden hamsters. No literature was found to suggest that zinc is mutagenic. 396 image: ------- CADMIUM Introduction The close relationship between zinc and cadmium makes it necessary to discuss both metals whenever one of them is under survey. This imperative was recognized early. In an extensive study published in 1926 on workers exposed to zinc8^ the authors pointed out that they had chosen a smelter treating zinc ore with low content of cadmium and lead to avoid significant effects from these other metals. However, this aspect has often been neglected since. Reports on effects of zinc inside or outside zinc smelters have sometimes not taken into account that significant exposure to cadmium, lead, or arsenic was also likely. Similarly, food poisoning reported to have been caused by zinc actually may have been caused by cadmium leaking from zinc-plated materials. Zinc compounds often contain relatively large amounts of cadmium, and since reports on animal exposures to large amounts of zinc seldom state the concentration of cadmium or lead, it cannot be ignored that some effects may have been caused by other metals. Aspects of relationships 1451 between zinc and cadmium have been discussed by Schroeder ejt a].. Metabolism and Effects of Cadmium Because the metabolism of zinc has been discussed elsewhere, only the metabolism and effects of cadmium will be mentioned. For further details, two recent reviews ' should be consulted. The following section is based on those two reviews. The systemic absorption of ingested cadmium in healthy human beings is about 6%. Data from experiments on rats indicate that calcium deficiency may cause higher absorption of cadmium. The placenta constitutes an effective 397 image: ------- barrier to cadmium and thus the newborn is virtually free from it. Absorbed cadmium will mainly accumulate in liver and kidneys; in normal people, the kidneys will contain about one-third of the total body burden. The main part of the cadmium is bound to a low molecular weight protein, metallothionein, which contains both cadmium and zinc. The synthesis of this protein is stimulated by exposure to cadmium. It has been claimed that zinc also may stimulate the synthesis and that metallothionein is important to zinc metabolism. * The accumulation of renal cadmium may eventually cause renal tubular dysfunction. The critical level, that is, the concentration at which the first signs may appear in sensitive individuals, has been estimated to be about 200 yg cadmium/g wet weight in renal cortex. Present mean concentra- tions in European and North American populations at age 50 are 15-30 yg cadmium/g wet weight, whereas in parts of Japan regarded as nonpolluted by cadmium, higher values have been reported. The first known sign of renal dysfunction in human beings is increased excretion of low molecular weight proteins. This sign may be followed by more advanced proteinuria, glycosuria, aminoaciduria, and disturbances in renal handling of calcium and phosphorus. Itai-itai disease,* found in Japan, is thought to be caused by disturbed mineral metabolism; women with calcium deficiency and renal damage caused by cadmium after prolonged ingestion of rice contaminated by the metal have exhibited the disorder. Excretion of cadmium is very slow and thus the biologic half-life is extremely long: estimates from between 10-30 yr have been postulated. *Itai-itai or \"ouch-ouch\" disease got its name from the severe pain caused by the multiple fractures of bones that occur. It is resistant to treatment with vitamin D^, except in extremely large doses. The disorder was reported in Toyama, Japan, where rice fields had been contaminated by river water used for irrigation. The pollution source was a zinc mine many miles upstream. 398 image: ------- INTERACTIONS .BETWEEN ZINC AND CADMIUM This section will mainly deal with in vivo interactions between zinc and cadmium, as a vast literature on in vitro effects of cadmium on zinc, especially in enzyme systems, is easily available. For accounts of such experiments, a 1663 review by Vallee and Ulmer may be consulted. Animals Major work in this field was initiated by Parizek,1206 who observed that a large dose of a zinc salt could prevent the action of a large single 579 dose of injected cadmium on the testes. His finding has been confirmed. ' 581-583,817,818,983 Also> the teratogenic and carcinogenic effect of large injected doses of cadmium can be unequivocally prevented by zinc. ' However, these were all acute experiments, involving large amounts of injected cadmium and zinc and with little application to long-term toxicity problems. That dietary cadmium could accentuate zinc deficiency symptoms was first shown in turkeys. \"* The adverse effect of cadmium could be reduced by 1574 increasing zinc intake. Similar findings were then obtained in chicks. This research had great heuristic value. Groups of chicks were fed diets with varying amounts of zinc and cadmium (and effects of copper and iron were studied as well). The basic diet contained 25 pg zinc/g and was supplemented with 200 pg zinc/g and/or 100 pg cadmium/g. It was found that cadmium depressed the growth rate and caused pathologic gizzard changes and that both these changes were reversed by zinc. Cadmium brought about hypochromic anemia, nf\\ -I which was not reversed by zinc. Bunn and Matrone studied groups of rats and mice. Some groups were pretreated so that they were copper-deficient. Zinc was added to the diet, which contained 9 pg zinc/g and 2 pg copper/g in a concentration of 200 or 400 pg zinc/g diet and/or cadmium in a concentra- tion of 100 pg/g diet for 5 wk. 399 image: ------- Whereas supplemented zinc did not increase zinc concentrations in liver or testes, ingested cadmium caused zinc concentrations to increase significantly in these organs in normal and copper-depleted mice on both basic and supplemental zinc diets. Also, supplemental copper increased zinc concentrations, especially in the testes. In rats the results were not so consistent. Cadmium exposure actually decreased liver zinc in copper-depleted animals on the basal diet, but hepatic zinc markedly increased in animals pretreated with a commercial diet. Even in zinc-supplemented and copper-depleted animals, there was only a slight increase in liver zinc, whereas animals treated with copper plus zinc increased their zinc levels markedly after cadmium exposure. Cadmium caused anemia, which was partly reversed by copper, but not by zinc. Indeed, anemia was more pronounced in mice given both zinc and cadmium. Banis et _al. made similar studies on rats. Zinc (200 Vg/g), cadmium to a basic diet. (100 yg/g), and iron (68 yg/g), alone or in combination, were added/ Cadmium depressed weight gain, and although zinc or iron alone did not reverse this effect, zinc plus iron did. Cadmium decreased hemoglobin concentration and cadmium plus zinc further reduced it. Another experiment demonstrated that cadmium intake increased liver zinc in animals on basal diets. Miller et al. found increased fecal zinc in calves given a diet with 40 yg zinc/g and 350 yg cadmium/g. Powell et al. found that in calves given 640 yg cadmium/g in a diet that also contained 27 yg/g of zinc, kidney and liver levels of zinc increased. No tissues examined were found with zinc levels below those of the controls. 400 image: ------- That there was an Increase in fecal zinc after ingestion of cadmium seems to ^ 7 ft conflict with the findings of Gunn e al., who found that injecting cadmium in rats caused reduced excretion of zinc-65 via feces. However, the high amount of dietary cadmium given by Miller et al..1059 may well have reduced zinc absorp- 578 tion. The results of Gunn et al. will be discussed in detail later. 1259 Pond et. al. gave 154 yg cadraium/g diet to pigs on diets high (74 yg/g) and low (22 yg/g) in zinc for 6 wk. Whereas low zinc alone did not depress weight gain, ingestion of cadmium did cause a significant drop, although the effect was partially overcome by the higher zinc intake. Fox et al.504a found that in young Japanese quail given a diet with cadmium (75 yg/g) and zinc (75 yg/g), cadmium markedly reduced the zinc content of the tibia. All the above experiments were performed using high dietary levels of 12^6 cadmium and/or zinc. In contrast, Petering et al. gave groups of weanling rats a zinc-deficient diet ( <2 yg zinc/g) and zinc in drinking water in concentrations of 0, 2, 8, and 32 yg/g. Optimum growth was obtained with 8 yg/g, whereas at 2 yg/g, growth was marginal. After 4 wk, 50% of the groups on 2 and 8 yg zinc/g water were then given cadmium in the water at a concentration of 3.4 yg/g for about 7 wk. The molar ratios of zinc:cadmium were 1:1 and 4:1. The cadmium exposure was considerably lower than those used earlier, and it is more realistic. It was found that in the group on 2 yg/g water, cadmium decreased the growth rate, and was responsible for some pathologic changes, such as corneal keratinization, which are seen in zinc- deficient animals. Gonads did not seem to be affected. Rats on higher zinc intake were not influenced by cadmium. The most significant finding with regard to distribution of zinc was that the zinc concentrations in testes markedly decreased in rats given marginal zinc and cadmium (molar ratio, 1:1), whereas no such change was noted 401 image: ------- in rats given zinc: cadmium at a ratio of 4:1. Therefore, cadmium can cause changes in distribution of zinc at marginal intakes. Zinc will still be stored in organs such as liver and kidney, where cadmium will accumulate. However, zinc may be depleted in other organs where cadmium does not accumulate as greatly. Most studies on long-term interactions between zinc and cadmium are ingestion 1691 experiments, and few studies use injection techniques. Vigliani reported on rabbits given subcutaneous injections of 0.25 mg cadmium/kg body weight, 5 days a week for several months. Some animals also were given injections of equiroolar amounts of zinc. Morphologic changes and degree of proteinuria revealed that cadmium alone caused more severe renal tubular damage than cadmium 1691 plus zinc. That cadmium can alter the metabolism of zinc has also been shown in 322 isotope experiments using zinc-65. Cotzias et al. gave 63 uM of cadmium, zinc, copper, or mercury as the sulfate or citrate in a single intravenous injection to rabbits, alone, simultaneously with, or after an injection of zinc-65 as the chloride. Cadmium as well as stable zinc changed the clearance curves of zinc-65 in blood similarly, whereas the other metals had no effect. And, there were differences in the distribution of zinc-65 activity in organs after the administration of zinc or cadmium. The authors interpreted the results to mean that some degree of interchange between cadmium and zinc occurred in vivo, but zinc-zinc and cadmiura-zinc interchanges were not identical. When zinc or cadmium was given some time after the zinc-65 injection, differences'appeared in the plasma zinc-65 curves, indicating a difference in exchange. The doses administered were high, but nevertheless these data indicate a possible interaction between cadmium and zinc. 402 image: ------- Gunn et. _al. found that cadmium decreased the uptake of zinc-65 in the testes and dorsolateral prostate. They conducted the following four studies on rats and mice: Rats were given an intracardial dose of zinc-65 4 mo, 1 wk, and 1 day after a subcutaneous injection of 3.4 rag cadmium/kg body weight. After 24 h, the zinc uptake of organs was measured. Increased zinc uptake was noted in liver, pancreas, and kidney, whereas no difference was found.in skeletal muscle, After an intracardial injection of zinc-65 to rats, an intracardial / injection of 2 mg cadmium/kg body weight was given 24 h later. Liver content of zinc-65 was measured 5 and 48 h after the cadmium injection. Five hours after injection, concentration of zinc-65 decreased in cadmium-treated animals compared to saline-treated controls whereas after 48 h the reverse was found. This initial displacement of zinc 322 from the liver had been noted before. i Zinc-65 was given to rats in an intracardial injection and feces were collected daily. Four days after the zinc dose, half of the rats were given a subcutaneous injection of 3.4 mg cadmium/kg body weight. Feces were collected for another 3 days. Compared to controls, zinc excretion decreased in the animals given cadmium and it was found that zinc-65 concentrations were higher in the cadmium-treated animals. 0 Three days after mice were injected subcutancously with 3.4 mg cadmium/kg body weight, they were given a subcutaneous dose of zinc-65. Animals were killed 1, 2, 3j and 7 days after the zinc-65 injection. Activity was measured in liver, kidney, pancreas, and carcass. Whole body retention was 15-20% greater in cadmium-treatod rats than in controls. 403 image: ------- The authors interpreted the results to mean that cadmium was interfering with the gastrointestinal excretion of zinc, thus causing zinc levels to rise in liver, kidney and pancreas. The present knowledge of cadmium metabolism suggests the opposite, that is, the decrease in excretion was caused by increased zinc retention. Studies also have been conducted on more specific physiologic problems. Whereas large doses of injected cadmium bound to cysteine increased renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, zinc had no effect at all. Cadmium, either after injections or long-term, low-level ingestion, can cause hypertension in experimental animals; it occurs at a molar cadmium:zinc into 1445 1445 ratio of > 0.4. When a zinc chelate was injected into animals made hyper- tensive by cadmium, blood pressure decreased rapidly. There are a number of zinc-dependent enzymes which could be susceptible in vivo to cadmium interference. Alkaline phosphatase activity decreased in renal cortex of rabbits exposed to cadmium for 6 mo by subcutaneous injections. This decrease still existed 6 mo after Che last injection. It was postulated that leucine aminopeptidase would be a kidney enzyme 1.691 susceptible to cadmium. 7A This enzyme is important for protein catabolism in the kidney and interference with that system could be influential in the development of tubular proteinuria. Cousins e aU showed that in cadmium-exposed pigs the activity of this enzyme in renal cortex was decreased after 150 pg cadmium/g in the diet (80 pg zinc/g) for 6 wk, resulting in a mean renal concentration of 78 pg cadmium/g wet weight, and about 100 pg/g wet weight in renal cortex. Because different levels of cadmium were given and both cadmium and zinc were determined in organs^ the research also dealt with distribution of zinc 404 image: ------- in relation to cadmium. Zinc levels increased ir whole kidney, and on a molar basis there was a distinct change between 150 and 450 pg cadmium/g diet. Exposure to 50 and 150 pg cadraium/g resulted in molar cadmium:zinc ratios of I 0.55 and 0.71 respectively, whereas 450 ^g/g made a molar cadmium:zinc ratio of 2.73. The renal concentrations of cadmium were 41, 78, and 276 pg/g wet weight. These results indicate that the critical level in this experiment must have been between 100 and 300 pg/g wet weight in renal cortex. The decreased leucine aminopeptidase activity indicates that the level could well be close to 100 Pg/g wet weight. Liver enzymes such as glutaraic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), phosphorylation, 1539 were studied by Sporn et al. Young rats were given diets supplemented with 10 pg cadmium/g and/or 80 pg zinc/g. Growth rate was not affected by cadmium. Cadmium caused a decrease in phosphorylation, but zinc counteracted this effect. Cadmium also reduced the activity of GOT, alkaline phosphatase, aldolase, and the succinoxidase system, but zinc did not affect this change. The authors emphasized that the zinc-cadmium interaction was not a case of general antagonism, but an effect limited to certain enzymes and metabolic sequences. Original cadmium and zinc levels were not reported. It was calculated by using data from similar exposures that the amounts of liver cadmium could only have been a few pg/g wet weight. 1449 Long-terra effects of cadmium were studied in two generations of mice. Cadmium was given in drinking water at a concentration of 10 pg/g from the end of the weaning period until the end of the experiment. The metal was found to be toxic for breeding mice to such an extent that there was no 405 image: ------- survival beyond the second generation. Congenital abnormalities appeared at a much higher frequency than in controls. Cadmium does not traverse the placenta and it is conceivable that a teratogenic effect was caused by a secondary zinc deficiency in the fetuses. However, cadmium and zinc were not determined in the organs. 1249a A recent paper on normal levels of cadmium and zinc in horse kidneys reported that cadmium concentrations in renal cortex varied from 5-250 yg/g wet weight in 37 horses aged 1-25 yr. At lower cadmium concentrations (5-70 yg/g) an equiroolar increase in zinc occurred, but at higher cadmium concentrations zinc did not increase to the same e.xtent as cadmium. Humans Information on the relationship between cadmium and zinc in humans has been 1451 obtained by autopsy studies. Schroeder et al. showed that parallel increases in 1250 zinc and cadmium levels in kidney occurred with age. Piscator and Lind found the same relationship and demonstrated that the increase in zinc was equiraolar to the increase in cadmium. This discovery was thought to be connected to the presence of raetallothionein in the renal cortex, because this protein normally has equiroolar amounts of the two metals. Furthermore, it was shown that if the amount of zinc equiraolar to the cadmium were subtracted from the total zinc, the physiologic amount of zinc in the cortex could be determined. The concentration of this zinc fraction was found to be about 160 yg/g dry weight (34 yg/g wet weight), piscator and Lind's data were obtained from members of the general population. They were not victims of occupational exposure, and had concentrations of cadmium below levels that could cause renal damage. 406 image: ------- CHAPTER 12 STANDARDS FOR ZINC LEVELS Air quality standards for zinc and its compounds have been established in many countries for occupational exposures, but a thorough search of the literature did not reveal any standards for public exposure. Table 12-1 presents the current standards for industrial situations, all of which are maximum allowable concentrations (MAC). Their variations may arise partly from historical reasons. Before 1962, the U.S. standard for Q zinc oxide fume was 15 mg/ra and was based primarily on the work of 402a 451a Drinker and Fairhall. Subsequent experience showed that zinc fume 3 28 fever occurred from exposures to less than 15 mg/m . No adverse effects have been reported where this standard is observed. EXISTING STANDARDS FOR WATER QUALITY281*' 1011b' 1645b\u00bb 1806a Standards for drinking water quality for zinc are based primarily on esthetic characteristics such as taste and cloudiness. Most standards recommend 5 mg soluble zinc/ 1 water, which is the threshold for the astringent taste. At 30 mg/1 the water becomes cloudy, and at 40 mg/1 it has 829 a metallic taste. Acute gastrointestinal distress will occur from concen- trations in the range of 280 mg/1 and above. Z_inc_JLnJ[)rinMn Water The levels at which zinc is found most frequently in drinking waters cannot be considered to be detrimental to human health. The current recom- mended standard is 5 mg/1. Zinc is an essential trace element in human and animal nutrition with a recommended daily allowance of 15 mg/day for adults 1119 and 10 mg/day for growing children. 407 image: ------- TABLE 12-1 Occupational Standards or_ Zinc and Zinc Compounds in Air- Country .

Craun and McCabe reported that the concentration of zinc at treatment plants was well below the current image: ------- Cadmium and lead are common contaminants of zinc used in galvanizing. Assuming that zinc is dissolved from galvanized water pipes no less than cadmium, dissolution of zinc to produce 5 mg/1 would be accompanied by some- thing less than the allowable 0.01 mg cadroium/1 when cadmium contamination of the zinc is as high as 0.03%. The cadmium may contribute to the acute gastrointestinal distress following ingestion. Similarly, lead concentrations would likely be increased by something less than the allowable 0.05 mg/1 when lead contamination of the zinc reaches as high as 0.6%. Based on the available evidence, the current drinking water standard of 5 mg/1 provides sufficient protection for consumers. Zinc _in_Wate_rways_ 869 Kopp and Kroner reported that in 1,207 positive tests for zinc on samples from U.S. waterways, the highest observed value was 1,138/ig/l (from the Cuyahoga River at Cleveland, Ohio) and the mean was 64 jsg/1. Soluble zinc was measured in over 76% of all water samples tested. The highest mean zinc value, 205 A\u00bbg/l, was found in the Lake Erie basin, whereas the lowest mean zinc value, 16>ug/l, was observed in the California basin. In seawater, the highest concentration of zinc has been found to be about 10 >ig/l. The toxicity of zinc compounds to aquatic animals Is modified by several environmental factors, particularly hardness, dissolved oxygen, and tempera- ture. Skidmore. in a review of the literature on the toxicity of zinc to fish, reported that salts of the alkaline earth metals are antagonistic to the action of zinc salts, and salts of certain heavy metals are synergistic in soft water. Elevations in temperature and reductions in dissolved oxygen increase the toxicity of zinc. Toxic concentrations of zinc compounds can affect eh* morphology and physiology of fish adversely. Acutely toxic con- centrations induce cellular breakdown of the gills, and possibly clog the 411 image: ------- gills with mucus. Conversely, chronically toxic concentrations of zinc com- pounds bring about general enfeebleraent and widespread histologic changes to * many organs, but not gills. Growth and maturation are retarded. See Chafer 6, \"Zinc in Aquatic Animals,\" for a detailed discussion of the effects of zinc on fish. 412 image: ------- CHAPTER 13 SAMPLING AND MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYZING ZINC SOLID AND LIQJJID,, CAMPLES Although the analytic chemical literature pertaining to zinc is quite extensive, only a limited number of techniques have enjoyed the bene- fit of extensive evaluation by various organizations of analysts and, where possible, these procedures are emphasized. Attention is paid to the evalu- ation of zinc in physiologic fluids and other biologic media, potable and polluted waters, foodstuffs, and soils and plants. Samples Levels of zinc in most media of direct interest to environmental health occur at the trace level and regardless of measurement technique, require that maximum care be exercised to minimize both loss of zinc from the sample and the contamination of the metal by zinc-containing reagents, vessels, etc. Contamination is especially worrisome in the case of zinc because of its ubiquitous presence in the general environment. Details of sampling procedure to minimize the above problems have been fairly well 1606 standardized and one is directed to the discussion by Thiers for specific information. In most procedures for zinc analysis, some prior treatment of the sample is necessary and involves destruction of the zinc-containing sample matrix. In practice, this involves wet-, dry-, and low-temperature ashing. A detailed discussion of the merits and disadvantages of the various ashing 551 techniques may be found in a recent book by Gorsuch. Zinc in Biologic Media Unlike procedures for foodstuffs, soils, plants and waters, standard- ized official methods for zinc analysis in physiologic media have not evolved. 413 image: ------- Consequently, the limits of accuracy, precision and detection which have been developed in representative methods will be noted. With liquid samples, deproteinization is usually carried out by using denaturants such as trichloroacetic acid, hydrochloric 1283,1369,1753 acid, or a combination of both. Mineralizing techni- ques involving wet or dry ashing may also be carried out and these pre- 1140 treatments are invariably necessary for most zinc analyses of bone, 642 661,809,1656 hair, and soft tissue. A newer, highly efficient mode of 541 dry ashing is low-temperature ashing, in which organic material is removed from the sample by an oxygenated high-energy plasma generated in a combustion unit by a radio-frequency discharge. Most spectrophotometric procedures for zinc determination in biologic media have involved the use of chelating agents which form colored coordi- 1044 nation complexes with divalent zinc. The most common is diphenylthio- carbazone (dithizone) and zincon. Dithizone is only moderately specific for zinc complexation and requires the concomitant use of masking agents and/or steps for removing interferents, whereas zincon is more selective to zinc complexation but forms a highly labile and complex chroraophore which necessitates rapid analysis. Measurement of zinc in biologic media by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) appears to be the current method of choice in most laboratories. Sample handling and reagent use steps are greatly reduced while sensitivity, accuracy, and precision remain superior. With the 373 advent of microsampling techniques in AAS, such as the Delves cup and 414 image: ------- 811 boat techniques,* as well as flaraeless atomic absorption spectral tech- 650 niques \u2014sampling manipulation and lower detection limits for elements like zinc are being revised downward continually, as is apparent from the 1162,1170 literature. Fluid samples may be deproteinated and diluted or 1031 simply diluted: both approaches enjoy routine use. Because they may enhance or repress the zinc absorption signal, chemical and physical matrix effects should be considered in zinc assay by AAS, although appropriate 278 steps can be taken to minimize them. When bone, hair, or soft tissue is involved, wet or dry ashing is necessary for conventional atomic absorption spectral \"analysis. Further, it is advisable to dry ash samples in platinum crucibles, as porcelain crucibles have been shown to 624 entrap zinc on their surface. For hair samples, an analytic compromise usually must be reached between chemical cleaning of hair surface to remove contaminating metals and leaching of zinc from hair by vigorous cleaning. A recent text of clinical chemistry techniques describes recommended 1750 methods for zinc evaluation in serum and urine. Serum is deproteinized with trichloroacetic acid, and the resulting supernatant is analyzed directly by AAS using a zinc 214 run line. To deprotelnize urine, zinc is chelated with ammonium pyrrolidino-dithiocarbamate and extracted with methyl isobutyl ketone^. *The Delves cup method is a microanalytic procedure for volatile elements such as lead, cadmium, etc. The sample is placed in a nickel crucible, which is inserted in the flame portion of an atomic absorption spectrometer. The burner is equipped with an absorption tube to enhance the collection of the atomized element present. The tube is fabricated of a ceramic or quartz material. With the boat technique, samples are placed in shallow boats con- structed of tantalum and inserted into the flame portion of the instrument. 415 image: ------- followed by aspiration of the organic phase into the flame of an atomic absorption spectrometer. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) appears to be the method of choice where very high sensitivity is desired and the requisite highly sophisticated in- strumentation is not available. Unlike other popular techniques, activation analysis permits determination of many trace metals or metalloids. Examples of the application of this method to zinc determination in biologic media 469,1165,1210 are available. Emission spectrography, using direct (dc) or alternating current (ac) arcs for excitation, is a multielement technique that has been employed for several years to measure zinc and other elements. But this technique has been limited by its lack of precision in exacting quantitative work, although this drawback is being offset by the use of increasingly more stable arcing 1651 accessories. Spectrofluorometric techniques for zinc analysis, a procedure de- scribing fluorometric analysis of zinc via the 8-quinolinol complex, 970 demonstrates a marked fluorescence at 517 nm when excited at 375 nm. 988 Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) is a newer method for zinc measurement; it demonstrates excellent sensitivity but requires that con- siderable pains be taken in sample pretreatment. More comparative data and research on the range of media studies are necessary to help establish ASV as a competitive alternative to atomic absorption or colorimetric techniques. In media such as soft tissue, in which various means of sampling are available, the method of expressing data is a particularly vexing 416 image: ------- problem In zinc and other element analysis. How data are expressed has hampered correlation of data on zinc levels from various sources. Measure- ment of zinc on a wet weight of tissue basis is made risky because evapor- ative loss may be incurred. And losses will vary with time the sample is exposed to the atmosphere, removal of excess moisture with filter paper, etc. An assessment of zinc on a lyophilic dry weight basis must consider moisture uptake by hygroscopic residues. Dry ash analyses may suffer from incomplete ashing, which will influence the ash weight. Some uniformity may be intro- duced by expressing zinc content per unit weight of protein, DNA, or other biochemical marker. Measuring^ Zinc in JPotable_ and \\laste_ Water Of the various acceptable techniques for zinc evaluation in potable and polluted waters, those involving spectrophotometry were standardized and extensively employed first. They operate through colored complexes formed by coraplexing of zinc with selected chelating agents. Representative are the dithizone and zincon methods (see Appendix B for details) for 1311a examination of waters. Colorimetric techniques for zinc in water are tedious procedures with problems of interference with the chromophore and stability, difficulties similar to those encountered in sampling biologic media of the generated complex. 131 la The presently accepted procedures are polarography and 319,1010,1023,1191b AAS, the latter perhaps enjoying widest use. Polarographic methods for evaluating zinc itself or zinc along with 1311a other metals have been described. Sample treatment includes preliminary removal of organic matter interferents from 100-ml samples by successive evaporations to dryness with concentrated nitric acid 417 image: ------- followed by final manipulation with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Samples relatively free of organic matter may be handled with a 1:15 ratio of hydro- chloric acid:water. Zinc is easily measured polarographically and the method permits routine evaluation of zinc in the 0.01-0.1 mg/1 range. AAS is especially suited to the evaluation of zinc in 319,1010,1023,119Ib water samples: in many cases, direct aspiration of the samples into the burner of the spectrophotometer can be carried out. The literature about zinc measurement in waters by AAS is extensive and growing. One is referred to the annual surveys in the Journal of the Water Pollution Control Federation, biennial review of water analysis, Analytical Chemistry, and an annual bibliography of AAS appearing in the Atomic Absorption Newsletter. Measuring Zinc in Soils Levels of zinc in most soils are usually in the trace quantity range and are examined by the analytic techniques previously mentioned. In a stan- 628,1382 dardized spectrophotometric procedure for zinc in soil in which the dithizonate complex is used, soil samples are ground, sieved, and digested with various mixtures of concentrated acids. Hydrofluoric acid is included when removing silicate is desired. Subsequent manipulation includes the use of citrate to mask iron and copper. Copper is removed as the dithizonate or is masked by carbamate or thiosulfate. The zinc dithizonate is extracted into an organic medium at a pH of 8.3. Polarographic measurement of the zinc content of soil digests or extracts, prepared as for the spectrophotometric procedure above,also have been described, although satisfactory results are offset by the 1029 tedium of the overall assay. 418 image: ------- 37 Soil zinc levels may also be obtained by AAS. Soil samples are either wet-ashed or dry-ashed with a mixture of perchloric, nitric and hydrofluoric acids or extracted with either hydrochloric acid or a chelating agent into an organic medium. Using ammonium pyrrolidino-dithiocarbamate and methyl isobutyl ketone as agents of chelation and extraction permits a multifold increase in overall sensi- tivity because of the high aqueous:organic phase ratios as well as the enhanced element signals found in organic media compared to an aqueous milieu. An alternative to concentrating is the use of ion exchange resins, for which a seventyfold increase was reported once. When zinc levels are desired as part of a multielement profile for a given sample, emission spectrography with an ac arc 628 has been employed. Samples are treated with a mixture of nitric, sulfuric, and perchloric acids to destroy organic matter. Sili- cate is removed by charring with hydrofluoric acid and a prepared buffered mixture. Aliquots are then placed in the carbon electrode crater for analysis. 477,478 Zinc has been analyzed in standard rock samples. Zinc in 478 rocks G-l and W-l was measured by optical emission spectrometry (OES), fluorescence (XRF) analysis, NAA, ASV, polarography. AAS, and spark- source mass spectrometry (SSMS). The values corresponded enough from the various methods to permit nine levels to be established for G-l (45 ppm zinc) and W-l (82 ppm zinc). To compile data for the new rock standards G-2, GSP-1, AGV-1, PCC-1, DTS-1 and BCR-1, methods of zinc analysis included OES, AAS, XRF, NAA, and polarography, and the following means were yielded: 419 image: ------- in Foodstuffs Two recommended methods for evaluating zinc in foodstuffs involve 725 34,1357 spectrophotoraetry and AAS. In the coloriraetric technique, samples are wet-ashed in the usual manner with nitric, sulfuric, and perchloric acids. Elements other than zinc are eliminated in large measure as the sulfides, whereas nickel and cobalt are removed with various chelating agents. Zinc is isolated as the dithizonate complex through carbon tetrachloride extraction and spectrophotometrically measured as such. Ten collaborating groups have evolved an atomic absorption method 1357 for zinc in foods, and it was deemed accurate and precise. Sources of zinc sampled in the study included sucrose, soybean meal, and white and whole wheat flour. Both wet- and dry-ashing steps were employed in the study. Recoveries were 98-102% with precision of 0.2-2.0% standard deviation. NAA has also been applied to evaluation of zinc In foodstuffs. Of particular interest is the NAA program of the Food and 1597 Drug Administration, in which relatively thorough assessments are being made of the elemental (including zinc) makeup of food stuffs of major economic importance. Samples are digested with 420 image: ------- sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide and in the case of foods, radio- chemical separations are carried out to simplify radionuclide counting. Analyzing Zinc in Plants The classic standard procedure for measuring zinc in plants is the spectrophotometric method, involving a mixed or single color technique 725 measuring zinc as the dithizonate. Samples are dry-ashed at 500-550 C and the residues taken up in dilute hydrochloric acid. After a series of extraction steps to rid the analytic medium of interfering ions, zinc is then measured as the dithizonate, either in the presence of (mixed color) or in the absence of (single color) an excess of complexing agent. AAS is rapidly becoming the most popular method of analyzing zinc in plants. Direct analysis of plant digests may be performed with little interference from other elements present. This method has been recommended for plant analysis on the basis of a compara- tive study between the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) 1507 colorlmetric procedure and AAS. Samples\u2014which included corn, sorghum, wheat, and alfalfa\u2014were wet- and dry-ashed. The accuracy of the AAS method was found to be as good as or superior to the standard colori- metric assay. 421 image: ------- AIR Zinc is encountered as an atmospheric ingredient entirely in suspended dust and dirt, so that determining zinc in the atmosphere becomes a matter of collecting and analyzing atmospheric particulates. Because zinc is often present in trace concentrations on the order of micrograms per cubic meter or less, the sampling and subsequent analyses require careful planning. Care is especially necessary in analytic procedures which determine zinc and 20-30 other elements simultaneously. This chapter summarizes methods of sampling airborne particulates and describes some of the advanced proce- dures for determining their zinc content. Surveys and Reviews In recent years, airborne particles have received considerable attention from investigators of air pollution, and this interest has coincided with the development of new instrumental methods of chemical analysis for zinc and other elements present in trace concentrations. Therefore, a wealth of literature exists on the collection and analysis of airborne particulates so that a comprehensive bibliographic review could easily become a treatise in itself. For the scope of this report, only the most recent and pertinent references have been cited.* * Chemical Abstracts (1967-1974), Air Pollution Abstracts (1971-1974), Applied Spectroscopy Reviews (1969-1974), and the of Radioanalytical Chemistry (1971-1974) were examined. 422 image: ------- The sampling and chemical analysis of atmospheric participates have been the subject of surveys, reviews, and collections of papers *39, 772\u00bb 1030, 1489 which do not always describe zinc determinations specifically, but are useful nonetheless for providing an overview of particle collection and characterization against which the occurrence and determination of zinc can be related. A procedures manual by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)16 reviewed air sampling and elemental determinations, including zinc determined by 1758 AAS. West reviewed the trace metal analysis of inorganic particulates and concluded that classical methods of gravimetric and titriroetric analysis are being replaced by instrumental methods offering advantages of selectivity and sensitivity: colorimetric and spectrophotometric methods, ring oven photometry, AAS, and polaro- 564 graphy. Greifer and Taylor surveyed methods for determining trace elements (concentrations less than 100 ppra) in environmentally important materials such as coal, fly ash, and incinerator ash that could eventually find their way into the atmosphere as particulates. They described the determination of zinc and 26 other elements using nuclear methods, SSMS, XRF and X-ray emission, absorption spectrophotometry, atomic emission spectrography, voltammetry (polarography), and potentiometry (ion-selective 815 electrodes). Kane and Larrabee reviewed trace analysis techniques for solids and their treatment of emission spectrography, activation analysis, SSMS, and XRF is directly applicable to particulate analysis for zinc content. Zief and Speights 1818 reviewed the techniques of trace element analysis and described sample handling and analysis by emission spectrography, flame spectrophotometry, absorption spectrophotometry, neutron activation, and coulometry. Specific information on zinc determinations was included where applicable. 423 image: ------- .^rAt Sampling To determine zinc in the atmosphere, airborne particulates must be collected and transported to the laboratory for chemical analysis because no good methods exist for carrying out trace element analysis in the field. Atmospheric sampling involves careful planning to assure that the elemental content of the samples in the laboratory is truly representative of the atmosphere in the locations sampled. Careless sample collection and handling may invalidate the most sophisticated and accurate chemical analyses. The number of samples taken for analysis and the variety of locations sampled must be sufficiently great to assure that all the trace elements, and zinc in particular, be represented in their correct concentrations in the collected specimens. Caution must be exercised to avoid problems arising from inhomogeneity of the particulates, variation of composition during sampling, sample alteration during transport, i.e., zinc losses or zinc contamination, and inefficient collectors which do not capture all the trace elements. A full treatment of the best places to sample, the bast times, how big a sample to take, how often and for how long, and how to collect and retain the zinc and -other trace elements is outsi-de the scope of this chapter. These matters are essential to a proper inter- pretation of the analytic data, and they may assume even greater importance if health considerations or legal implications are involved. Many of these principles of trace element sampling are discussed by Hendrickson, Fair et al..A51 and the AEC.1644 There are various techniques for collecting suspended particulates from the air, and the most widely used are filtration methods and impingers. Other particle collectors include electrostatic precipitators, 424 image: ------- The sampling techniques may be divided into two broad categories: those which collect total participates and those which fractionate the samples into size classifications. The latter samplers are popular where the occurrence of zinc in the atmosphere is to be correlated with particle sizes. Most particulate samples are obtained with filters, the most popular filter materials being paper (randomly matted cellulose fiber), membrane (thin plastic structures with flat, porous surfaces), and glass fiber. Metallic silver is used at times, as when wet chemical analyses require acid dissolution of the filter material. Membrane filters (Millipore, Gelman, Nuclepore, etc.*) collect on their surface (as opposed to the bulk material matrix)all particles of a size larger than the stated pore size. They are available in a variety of materials such as cellulose acetate- nitrate copolyroer, polyvinyl chloride, nylon, and Teflon. The 0.45-um and 0.8-um pore sizes are widely used for air sampling. Contrary to popular belief, filters do not work by simply straining the air stream, although this sieving action is one mechanism by which particles are trapped. The primary filter action is impact ion, resulting when the air stream suffers a sudden change in velocity (magnitude and direction) and the particles continue onward from inertia to impact with the substrate where they remain entrapped. The relative effects of irapaction versus sieving are shown by the ability of Whatman 41 filter paper (widely used in air sampling) to collect about 98% of 0.2 pro particles from an air stream of 100 cm/sec face velocity although the pore size is * Trade names have been identified solely to help readers and do not imply any endorsement or recommendation by the National Academy of Sciences or the National Research Council. 425 image: ------- 20 pm,910 or the 0.45 ym pore size membrane filter to collect 0.1-um particles.665 Diffusion, a third filter mechanism, is of minor importance 910 with the thin filters and the relatively high air velocities used. High volume samplers, such as those used in the U.S. National Air Sampling 2 Network (NASN) draw air through a filter at a rate of 1.1-1.7 m /min (1,100- 1,700 1/min) and are considered a standard method of outdoor particle collect- 7R9 iotx. Low volume samplers such as are used for sampling the occupational environment operate in the range of 5-50 1/min; and personal (lapel) samplers, limited in size and weight to small battery-operated devices, operate at 1-3 1/min. Impaction devices are samplers which collect particles impinging on surfaces (as cascade impactors) or in liquid bubblers fas midget Impingers). Cascade impactors such as the Andersen sampler are made up of a series of stages (often six or more). The stages consist of plates containing holes or slots of progressively decreasing size, which effect a size separation of air-entrained particles. The particles are not sieved by the holes but are deposited according to the air velocities in each stage; the largest particles are deposited in the earliest stages where the air velocities are lowest, and the finer particles are carried toward the later stages where the air velocities increase with decreasing hole size. The overall volume rate of flow remains constant, about 28 1/min for the Andersen sampler. The particles are deposited on paper or membrane filters, sticky tape, glass or stainless steel surfaces, or agar in Petri dishes. The trace metal content of filter materials and irapaction surface coverings themselves have been investigated extensively because of its 353 possible interference with the particulate analyses. Dams etal. tested 426 image: ------- 10 filter materials by NAA using lithiua-drifted germanium (Ge[Li]> detectors or their spectrometers and found high trace element concentrations in most of the materials. Cellulose paper and membrane filters had the lowest trace 2 metal content, 7-30 ng/cm zinc, compared with filters such as polystyrene, which had 60-515 ng/cm zinc. Bodart et al.137 analyzed finely dispersed filter paper for 10 elements using XRF and lithium-drifted silicon (Si[Li]> and Ge(Ll) detectors and found 0.13 + 0.04 pg/cm zinc. Birks et al. determined 17 elements in membrane and paper filters and found 2 0.2-30 ug/crn zinc through XRF measurements, compared to Bowman et al., who found 0.007-0.025 jjg/cm zinc by NAA. a Birks et al. also reported EPA figures based on OES that showed glass fiber filters to have a very 2 1353 high zinc content (160 ug/cm ). Robertson summarized contamination problems in trace element analysis and gave the zinc content of polyethylene filters as 25-300 ppb, membrane filters as 2.4 ppm, polystyrene as 4 ppm, paper as 27 ppm, and tissue paper as 49 ppm; he concluded that paper and membrane filters were suitable for collecting particulates from the atmosphere. Midget impingers also are mentioned as particle collectors in the 910 air pollution literature. They resemble gas scrubbers in that the air stream from a nozzle la bubbled through a liquid in a container. The particles are collected in the liquid by an impaction mechanism although the liquid also has a scrubbing action on the gas stream. Various sizes of impingers are marketed, the midget impiuger mentioned above accepting an air flow of 2.8 1/min. These collectors have the disadvantage that some zinc may leach out of the particles into the liquid to cause a negative error, or else some zinc from the container walls may transfer over to the 427 image: ------- particulates to give a positive error (contamination). This collection device is popular because of its simplicity and low cost. When particles are to be collected over an extended period of a month or so and they are large enough (5 pro or larger) to settle out as dust without the aid of motorized blowers, then they may be sedimented into suitable containers using standardized methods such as the Intersociety Committee's 780 tentative method for analyzing dustfall from the atmosphere, or the procedure for collecting and analyzing dustfall proposed by the American 30 Society for Testing and Materials. The advantages of simplicity, low cost, and unattended operation sometimes may be offset by contamination from trees, insects, bird droppings, or curious passersby. Sedimented particles that have settled out on soil and vegetation by the natural action of winds and rain are sometimes studied as alternatives to collection in sedimentation bottles. They have provided valuable information on the 198, 765, 891, 1638 amount of zinc and other elements carried in the atmosphere. Less frequently used collectors include electrostatic precipitators which impart an electrical charge to the particles so that they are attracted to an oppositely charged electrode. The collector electrode may be covered with a membrane filter for ease in handling the collected material, or with a sample grid for subsequent instrumental analysis, as with an electron microprobe. This type of collector has a high collection efficiencv and does not damage the particles physically, but its awkward handling in the field accounts for the poorer incidence of its use. Cyclone samplers which impart a centrifugal motion to the air stream and collect the particles in sharp size fractions above about 5 jjra through inertial effects are becoming available and are enjoying increased use. Therraan precipitators that impart a thermal 428 image: ------- gradient to the air stream and collect particles on the colder of two plates are not used often for particle collection in air pollution studies because of snail handling capacities and the extensive cleaning required between samples. P_eter1Bina_t-iOD__of_Zlnc _i Most of the work in this field has concentrated on pollution, with interest directed toward the simultaneous determination of all the metals present in the atmosphere rather than zinc or any other element in particular (except for lead and mercury). Large numbers of low cost, multielement analyses of high sensitivity and good precision and accuracy have been needed most, and this need is being satisfied by the development of sophisti- cated computer-assisted instrumental methods. Several reviews ' ' ' are devoted almost entirely to instrumental methods of analysis. In contrast, classical wet methods of zinc determination as 428 exemplified by the absorption spectrophotometry of dithizone complexes, are slow and expensive. Also, they are suitable for determining only one element at a time and subject to interferences from the other elements present in the particulates. This is not to say that wet chemistry has been discarded; on the contrary, wet chemical manipulations are indispensible for the dissolution of particulates for AAS or polarography, for chemical separations in activation analysis, and for destruction of filter substrates when required. Analytic techniques reported for zinc are NAA, SSMS, XRF spectrometry, OES, AAS, and the classical techniques and polar- ography. 429 image: ------- A^.l.t?:\u00b0H Spectrophotometry Although the literature is heavily oriented toward instrumental methods which require a minimum of sample handling (and often not even sample dissolution), this wet-chemistry technique continues to be used because of its modest apparatus requirements, good sensitivity, and potential for high accuracy. In absorption spectrophotometry the particulates are dissolved, interfering elements are removed or sequestered, and the visible or ultraviolet light absorption of a suitable colored complex is measured in solution at a characteristic wavelength. 978 Marshall et al. described the determination of zinc oxide particulates in air by collection on a membrane filter, dissolution in dilute hydrochloric acid, and colorimetric determination using 4-(2'-thiazolylazo)- resorcinol (TAR) at a wavelength of 530 nm. Zinc oxide concentrations up to o 17.4 mg/m were measured, more than twice the threshold limit value set by the United Kingtom. Sereda and Artemova collected particulates on a filter, dissolved them in dilute hydrochloric acid, separated out inter- fering metals on an anion exchange column, eluted the zinc with 0.65 M hydrochloric acid, and determined it colorimetrically using sulfarsazen* RBO at 510 nm. The method detected 0.04 pg/ml zinc. Krylova sampled particulates at a rate of 10-15 1/min, dissolved them in 1:1 hydrochloric acid, precipitated interfering metals as dithiocarbamates, and determined zinc colorimetrically using sulfarsazen at a wavelength of 500 nm. The sensitivity was 0.5 yg zinc in 5 ml solution. Further information on absorption spectrophotometry for trace metal determinations has been summarized by Weiss. * Benzene sulfonic acid, 4-[{4-[3-(2-arsono-4-nitrophenyl)-l-triazenyl] phenyl} azoj\u2014, monosodiura salt. C. 1772-02-07. image: ------- Atomic Absorption Spectrometry AAS measures the absorbance of light by a sample when it is present as an atomic vapor at a specific wavelength that is characteristic of the individual element being determined, here 213.9 run for zinc. A light source often containing the element of interest incorporated in one of the electrodes emits the specific line spectrum of this element, and a simple monochromator isolates the wavelength to be measured. Absorbance is proportional to the concentration of ground state atoms when the vaporized sample is introduced into the light path in the atomic state. The production of vaporized sample in the atomic state usually is accomplished by atomizing a solution of the sample into a flame, or by vaporizing the solution on a tungsten or tantalum ribbon, graphite rod, or in a graphite furnace. The method is rapid, sensitive, and highly specific for metals, although it is subject to some interferences from anions and organic materials. It is well suited to accurate determination of zinc in atmospheric particulates. Atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) is a related analytic technique in which the optical path is broken at a 90\u00b0 angle and the stimulated visible and ultraviolet emission from the atoms is observed rather than their absorption. When the direct flame emission is observed without a separate light source, the technique is called flame emission spectrometry (FES). 206 Burrell has reviewed these three techniques. The analytic procedure of AAS involves collection of particulates on a filter, acid dissolution of the sample, destruction of organic matter including the filter, and measurement against suitable standards. In an extensive review of the use of AAS for determining trace metals including 431 image: ------- zinc in atmospheric participates, Hwang noted a yearly average of about 0.001 yg/ai^ zinc in urban air samples from 22 cities with incidences up to 1.6 yg/ 2 The unsuitability of glass fiber filters Q-60 yg/cm zinc impurity) and the acceptability of silver and cellulose membrane filter materials CO.01 and 2 0.002 yg/cm zinc, respectively) were mentioned. Thompson et al. determined zinc and 12 other metals by collection on glass fiber filters and oxidation with a low-temperature asher to destroy organic materials (oxygen passing through a corona discharge formed a strongly oxidizing oxygen plasma which ashed samples at 150 C instead of the 500 C used in conventional furnace ashing). The particulates were dissolved in acid and analyzed by AAS at a wavelength of 213.8 nm. The 3 3 technique gave a detection limit of 0.2 ng/m for zinc based on a 2,000 m air sample. The sample preparation procedure was stated to be suitable 3 for FES as well, for which a zinc detection limit of 120 ng/m was found. TOT f Ranweiler and Moyers measured 22 metals in atmospheric particulates by collection on polystyrene filters using high volume samplers, dry ashing at 400-425' C, and dissolution with a mixture of hydrofluoric, hydrochloric, and nitric acids in Teflon bombs. After appropriate dilutions and matrix corrections by adding lanthanum and cesium, zinc and 21 other elements were determined. High zinc concentrations in the reagent blanks were attributed to filter and reagent impurities, and urban air was reported to contain 0.15 yg/m zinc. The usual means of producing atomic vapor by nebulizing a sample solution into a flame requires relatively large volumes of solution, a disadvantage in air particulate analyses in which samples are limited. Recently, flameless devices have been introduced to improve sensitivity and decrease sample requirements from milliliters of solution to microliters 432 image: ------- of solution. Matousek and Brodie167' 986 filtered air particulates directly into perforated graphite cups containing membrane filters. The cup was part of a carbon rod furnace in the instrument light path, and direct determinations of lead and cadmium could be made in air samples as small as 200 ml. Although zinc was not reported, the technique is mentioned because it is novel, and appears to be suitable for the determination of many more metals than lead and cadmium. The necessity of destroying all organic matter, including membrane, cellulose, and polystyrene filters, has aroused some controversy over suitable procedures for accomplishing this without loss of the volatile zinc. Morgan and Homan, in unpublished work mentioned by Hwang and 1609 Thompson et al., reported the recovery of only 39% of the zinc after ashing samples in a furnace at 550 C, compared with 96% recovery with a low-temperature oxygen plasma. Dissolving the membrane filter in acetone 766,767 before ashing in a furnace at 550 C has been recommended. Van 1681 Jlaaphorst et al. summarized the contradictory claims regarding zinc losses during dry ashing and reported his results of radioactive tracer experiments, which showed no volatilization of zinc after dry ashing in porcelain crucibles for 20 h at temperatures to 1,000 C, and no adsorption of zinc on crucible 866 walls to 550 C. Kometani et al. studied 3ry ashing of airborne particulates on paper and glass fiber filters as a preliminary step in analysis by AAS, and also concluded that losses were not from volatilization but from formation of insoluble silicates. It is inferable from these papers that difficulties encountered with high temperature ashing had a variety of causes and volatilizing of zinc was less important than formation of insoluble slags. 433 image: ------- 853 861 Kleinman et al. and Kneip et al. correlated the results of AAS analysis of atmospheric participates with .neteorologic phenomena. The mixing height of the atmosphere, taken as the height of the inversion layer and measured daily with balloon-borne temperature and altitude sensors, was considered to limit the dispersion of pollutants rising into the air from emission sources at ground level. Multiplying this height in meters by the wind speed in meters/second yielded a product related to the zinc 2 concentration and defined as the dispersion factor, with unite of m /sec. Marked seasonal variations for zinc and for the total particulates, involving spring minimums and summer maximums, were attributed to changes in the atmospheric capacity for mixing, as indexed by this dispersion factor. For additional information on applications of AAS, 1300 attention is invited to Price s work. Optical Emission Spectroscopy Optical emission methods measure the wavelength and intensity of visible and ultraviolet radiation emitted from excited electronic states of atoms introduced into arc and spark excitation sources. They are suitable for rapid, semiquantitative, multielement surveys of airborne particulates as well as for accurate quantitative measurements of Individual elements. An emission spectrographic laboratory utilizes critically aligned, vibration-free optical and excitation instruments, computer-based data processing, and personnel with a high degree of skill and training. Never- theless, the speed, high sensitivity, and broad applicability of OES make it one of the most popular analytic techniques for determining zinc in the 1390 atmosphere. 434 image: ------- The technique generally involves powdering or ashing the samples, mixing them with a buffer and an internal standard, and arcing in graphite 894 electrodes. Lander et al. described the spectrographic determination of zinc and 11 other elements in airborne particulates. Samples collected on paper or membrane filters were analyzed without further treatment by rolling the papers tightly into cylindric graphite sample electrodes and burning them with high voltage spark excitation in an oxygen atmosphere. Zinc was measured at a wave length of 213.9 nm. Calculations and tabula- tion of results were performed by a computer. Individual filters 25 mm in diameter, sampled at a rate of 14 1/min, contained up to 1.5 ug zinc, with the detection limit judged to be 0.1 jjg zinc. Coefficients of variation (the measure of precision) ranged from +9 to + 60% for the individual elements. 1562 Sugimae collected airborne particulates on a silver membrane filter, dissolved the filter in dilute nitric acid,precipitated the silver with hydrochloric acid, evaporated the solution to dryness and determined zinc and 11 other elements simultaneously by emission spectrography using dc arc excitation. Zinc was determined in the concentration range 0.13- 3 \"^ 2.5 yg/m , based on a sampled air volume of 400 nr (50-1,000 ug/filter) with a precision of + 15%, using the analytic line pair of zinc I 334.5020 nm and indium I 303.9356 nm. 778 Imae et al. collected particulates on membrane filters for 10 days using a low volume sampler with a flow rate of 20 1/min, burned the filters with ethanol (C2H5OH) in a quartz boat and further ignited the carbonized ash in a low temperature plasma to remove the carbon and residual organic materials. They mixed the ash with indium and palladium oxides , buffered with lithium carbonate 435 image: ------- and graphite, and excited the sample in an ac arc to determine zinc and 12 other trace elements. The urban zinc concentration was reported as 0.14-1.02 yg/m3 with a precision of + 16.5%, using the 328.23 nm analytic line for zinc. Metallic impurities in hydrochloric acid extracts of 105 mm diameter filter materials also were measured: zinc content was 0.4-1.0 yg for 5 membrane filters, 10.0 vg for 1 polystyrene filter, and 73 yg-10.3 mg for 6 glass filters. Seeley and Skogerboe^\u00b0\u00b0 avoided problems of filter contamination and disposal by using the graphite spectroscope electrodes as filters for atmos- pheric particulates, sampling at a rate of 1 1/min. They determined zinc and 13 other elements directly by emission spectroscopy using dc arc excita- tion with indium as an internal standard. Their detection limit for zinc was 3 ng when the analytic wavelength of 334.502 nm was used. 914 Lee et al. reporting on the results of emission spectrographic analyses of particulates collected by the National Air Surveillance Cascade Impactor Network (NASN), emphasized the variation of metal concentrations with particle size. Particulate matter collected biweekly over 24-h periods with a 5-stage Andersen sampler was extracted with nitric acid, buffered with lithium chloride, and analyzed on a 2-meter spectrograph employing a rotating disc and high-voltage spark source. Indium and yttrium were taken as internal standards. The annual concentration levels observed for 3 zinc were 0.1-1.7 yg/m , which were intermediate between highs for iron and lead and lows for nickel and vanadium. Particle size distributions were correlated with metal concentrations for zinc and 11 other elements. About 70-80% of the zinc particles were smaller than 2 ym, and 40% were smaller than 1 ym. No seasonal pattern was discerned, but a geographic pattern hinted at possible urban sources of zinc in the atmosphere. 436 image: ------- X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry XRF spectrometry, also known as X-ray emission Spectrometry, measures the characteristic photon or X-ray emissions that result when higher energy electrons fall into a K or L shell whose electron was previously ejected by irradiation with high energy photons or particles. The energy of the emitted X radiation is characteristic of the elements present in the sample, and the frequency with which the transitions occur is proportional to the quantity of element present. All elements above sodium can be determined rapidly without any sample preparation. The instrumentation required includes an excitation source which may be an X-ray tube, radioisotope, or other source of electrons, protons, or ions; a sample holder; an analyzer to resolve the emitted X rays into an energy spectrum by wavelength dispersion (such as crystal diffraction, or bandpass filters) or by energy dispersion; and an X-ray detector. Detectors used with wavelength dispersion spectrometers may be scintillation detectors, or gas-filled or gas-flow proportional detectors. Detectors used with energy- dispersive spectrometers are the solid-state Si(Li) detectors, with an out- put pulse height proportional to the incident energy. A great many combinations of source, analyzer, and detector are possible. Several very readable introductions to the principles of XRF analysis 114, 115, 531 exist. Four types of excitation (X-ray tubes, fluorescers, radioisotopes, and high energy ions) are compared, as well as two types of data analyzers (crystal spectrometers and energy-dispersive detectors) for determining 10-20 elements including zinc in air particulates. A multichannel crystal spectrometer instrument is recommended as the optimal technique for measuring at least 12-14 elements simultaneously. If only 437 image: ------- one or a few elements are of interest, then energy dispersion analysis with a low power X-ray tube or high activity radioisotope and a simple proportional counter may be an adequate alternative to sophisticated laboratory instrumenta- tion. Zinc detection limits for 100-sec measurements of prepared standards 2 ranged from 51 ng/cm for X-ray tube excitation and wavelength dispersion 2 to ng/cm for isotope (iron-55) excitation and energy dispersion. XRF results for zinc and 16 other elements were comparable to atomic absorption measurements made on the same particulate samples. Studies of 115 elemental impurities in filter materials have been mentioned earlier. 1337 Rhodes et al. compared energy-dispersive XRF spectrometry using radioisotope sources with AAS for determining zinc and 16 other elements in particulates collected with high volume samplers on cellulose 3 filter paper. Air pollution data presented for urban areas averaged 0.13 ug/m zinc, compared with a national average of 0.67 yg/m . The X-ray analyses produced consistently lower results than the atomic absorption determinations, and this discrepancy was thought to be an effect of particle size of the samples. 958 Luke et al. compared XRF spectrometry with AAS for analyzing particulates collected on filter paper. Zinc and six other elements were determined by direct X-ray analysis, X-ray analysis of samples after wet chemical separations, and AAS. The results, between 2-100 yg/cm2 for zinc, were comparable for-all 3 techniques. 924 Leroux and Mahmud analyzed particulates collected in an urban area on membrane filters and found 0.08-4.03 yg/m3 zinc. The analyses 529 took only 5 min/element. Giauque et al. used X-ray-induced XRF spectrometry to determine zinc and other elements in particles collected over 438 image: ------- 2-h intervals for 24 h with a 4-stage impactor. Detection limits for zinc 3 ^ were stated to be 4 ng/m on membrane filters and 2 ng/m on Mylar filters. Diurnal charts showing changes of zinc concentrations with time were presented 230 for several cities. Cares described X-ray spectrometric procedures for airborne dusts and included a detailed method for preparing reference OQg standards, but zinc was mentioned only in passing. Dittrich and Cothern analyzed trace metals in urban atmospheric particulates using a high volume air sampler to collect particles on filter paper. A y-ray source (americium- 241) and a bremsstrahlung excitation source (promethium-147) both were used to produce X rays. Data for zinc and six other elements were presented 3 1071 as counts rather than as yg/m . Mitsugi et al. collected air particulates on filter paper using a high volume sampler, and determined zinc and lead concentrations directly; also, samples collected with an electrostatic precipita- tor were briquetted with boric acid and analyzed. Zinc concentra- 3 tions in the range of 0.25-1.06 yg/m agreed with results yielded by AAS. 137 Bodart et al. analyzed particulates on filter papers by irradiating the filters with 1.7 million electron volt (MeV) protons from a low energy Van de Graaff generator, and detecting XRF with Si(Li) and Ge(Li) detectors. Standards were prepared from pure salts and powdered paper filters. Findings were presented for 10 elements: results for zinc fell in the 1.40 + 0.14 2 yg/cm range. Mizohata americium-241 excited, energy- dispersive XRF spectrometry to determine zinc and 11 other elements in airborne urban dust samples. Corrections for sample loading on membrane filters were made by comparing the X-ray data with determinations from instrumental NAA. (The measured X-ray emission of zinc decreased about 20% as the mass 2 loading of the filter increased from 0.2 to 7.5 mg/cm because of self- 439 image: ------- absorption in the sample.) Actual dust samples collected with a low 2 volume air sampler were found to contain 1.1-48.7 yg/cm zinc, as measured by the two techniques. 625 Hammerle et al. compared XRF spectrometry with NAA for determining 10 elements in atmospheric particles. The zinc analyses for both techniques 3 agreed within 6.7% of the average of 0.28 yg/m found in urban particulates. 314 Cooper compared particle- and photon-excited XRF determinations of zinc and about 20 other elements in urban aerosols collected on filter paper, and in rural aerosols collected on Mylar film in an impactor. The samples were cemented as thin samples or briquetted as thick samples, and analyzed by excitation with either high energy a-particles (80 MeV and 30 Me'V) or protons (4 MeV and 2 MeV). Cooper also studied photon excitation with a molybdenum target X-ray tube, and with high intensity radioisotope excitation using iron-55 and cadmium-109 sources, and measured the energy spectrum with a Si(Li) detector. Zinc was reported at a concentration of o 1-5.6 ng/m in typical urban particulates. Photon excitation methods were concluded to be significantly more sensitive than high energy a-excitation, with the additional advantages of small size, easy portability, and applica- bility to a wide variety of samples for trace element analysis of environ- mental particulates. This brief survey of the application of XRF spectrometry to the determination of zinc in air particulates shows that it is a popular analytic technique because 20 or so elements may be determined simultaneously and directly on filters without prior sample manipulations such as acid dissolution, extraction, or ashing. What cannot be emphasized strongly 440 image: ------- enough is the necessity of having reliable calibration standards because the technique is substrate-sensitive. Dried solutions of pure salts on filters may not simulate collected particulates closely enough, because the latter are mixtures of many different inorganic and probably organic materials with different particle sizes and shapes. It seems reasonable to use a uniformly deposited, exhaustively analyzed natural material for an X-ray calibration standard to supplement the data obtained with pure salts. Neutron Activation Analysis Activation analysis is similar to XRF or emission spectrometry except that it is the atomic nucleus rather than an extranuclear electron which is energized by irradiation with energetic particles or photons. The emitted radiation of the nucleus as it decays radioactively is measured. The energy and type of the emitted radiation as well as its rate of decay identify the nucleus, and the intensity of the radiation is a measure of the amount of element present. The technique generally involves irradiation with thermal neutrons, chemical separation of the activated species, and measurement of the emitted radiation, preferably with solid-state detectors coupled with multichannel analyzers and computer-controlled data processing to convert spectral counts and energies to elemental concentrations. Although a variety of neutron sources is available (neutron generators and isotopic neutron sources such as californium-252), the trace metal concentrations in air- borne particulates are so low that high thermal neutron fluxes of the order 12 13 2 of 10 or 10 n/sec/cm are required and these fluxes are available only from nuclear reactors. Chemical separations of activated species may be required if the energies of emitted radiation from many elements overlap; image: ------- however, the high resolutions available from the new solid-state Ge(Li) y~ detectors make direct sample assays possible without the need for wet 01c 83s chemistry. Two reviews ' give a concise introduction to the subject. 352 354 1311 Dams et al. ' and Rahn et al. have described the determina- tion of 33 elements in air pollution particulates directly on filters without prior chemical separations. Particulates collected on polystyrene filters were irradiated for 2-5 h (for long-lived isotopes such as zinc) in a nuclear reactor at a thermal neutron flux of 1.5 x 10^ n/sec/cm2 together with a standard mixture of elements in a polyethylene bottle. After irradiation, the samples and standards were counted with a Ge(Li) detector coupled to a 4,096 channel pulse height analyzer. The spectra were recorded on seven-track magnetic tape for subsequent data reduction by computer. Zinc was determined as the 13.8-h zinc-69 metastable radioisotope, using the 438.7 kiloelectron volt (KeV) radiation. The detection limit for zinc was 0.2 yg, which corresponded to an urban air concentration of 0.02 ug/m^ for a 24-h sample. The authors commented that emission spectrography would o detect about 0.24 ug/m zinc in such a sample. Suspended particulates o 3 contained 180-1,690 ng/nr zinc (standard deviation, 10-300 ng/m ). Dams and co- 353 workers used this analytic technique to evaluate filter materials and study airborne trace element distributions. ' 1311 2inc and antimony exhibited similar well-defined distribution patterns which were correlated to geographic areas. 887 Kuykendall et al. used automated instrumental NAA to determine zinc and 39 other elements in air filter samples. Particulates collected on filter paper with a high volume sampler operating for 24 h at a flow rate of 1,223-1,631 m3/day were irradiated in a neutron flux of 5 x 1012 f\\ n/sec/cm for 8 h (for long-lived radioisotopes such as zinc), and counted 442 image: ------- directly with a Ge(Li) detector coupled to a 3,200 channel pulse height analyzer with computer-compatible magnetic tape readout, sample changer, and system controller which permitted continuous unattended counting of many samples. Zinc was reported in the range of 48-1,453 ng/m3, with 3 a mean of 410.5 ng/m , which was well above the stated detection limit of 120 ng/m3. 1440 Schramel et al. determined zinc and 11 other elements in dustfall samples collected for 1 mo periods in polyethylene bottles, thereby avoiding the limitations of filter blanks. The particulates were sealed in quartz ampoules and irradiated for 24 h in a thermal neutron flux of 1013 n/sec/cm . They were cooled for 3 days, and the zinc group was chemically separated from the other elements and counted with a Ge(Li) detector connected to a 4,096 channel pulse height analyzer. High zinc concentrations were noted in areas of heavy vehicular traffic (16.26 mg/g), which were thought to be caused by airborne rubber particles from automobile tire wear. 1788 Winchester discussed the significance of the results of NAA as they related to occurrence and transport of pollution and natural substances in the air. He recommended that sampling from aircraft be seriously consid- ered for acquisition of improved data. , Particulates have been collected with excellent size fractionation 49 539 548 on polyethylene films in a cascade impactor ' * and analyzed for 18 elements by instrumental NAA. Zinc occurred predominantly in the finest particles, in 100 times the concentrations found in the coarsest particles. Actual particle sizes were not determined. Statistical correlations with elemental abundances from known sources such as the earth's crust, marine aerosols, coal and oil combustion, and automobile 443 image: ------- exhausts did not explain the zinc enrichment in the atmosphere. Thr- fact that the greatest amounts of xin< were found In I he smallest particles seemed to vaporization followed by condensation, that Is, a combustion source, ft 539 was suggested that tire dust generated by abrasion would most likely consist of large particles, so that the hypothesis of tire wear as a source of zinc ' would not be consistent with measured particle size distributions. 1247 Pi Hay and Thomas described the analysis of airborne participates using sequential air sampling onto special high-purity filters, high flux 13 2 (3 x 10 n/sec/cm ) thermal neutron Irradiation, and high-resolution Y-ray spectrometry to determine zinc and 1.8 other elements. Instrumental neutron activation for multielement analysis of airborne particles has been described 252, 351, 547, 556, 795 by other investigators. 49 Aras et al. determined 14 elements Including zinc by an Instrumental photon activation technique. Atmospheric particulates were Irradiated with bremsstrahlung from 35 mev electrons produced with a linear accelerator, and the emitted y-ray radiation was counted with a Ge(Ll) detector. Zinc was determined by the zinc-68 (y,p) copper-67 reaction, and was reported 3 In the range of 0.09-0.22 jjg/m at several sampling locations. The detection 3 -53 limit for zinc was reported to be 3 ng/m , compared with 4 x 10 ng/m for 3 Instrumental NAA, and 0.0025 ng/m for flame methods. Therefore, it was concluded that Instrumental photon activation analysis was a useful technique for analyzing particulates. Instrumental NAA Is the method of choice for many Investigators who determine zinc and other elements simultaneously in air particulates. The wide applicability of this analytic technique has 379 been thoroughly demonstrated. 444 image: ------- Mass Spectroroetry Ma0e spectrometry of airborne particulars in usually taken to mean S8MS, in which samples introduced as electrodes in an evacuated chamber are pulsed with a 1 megahertz (MHz) radio frequency (rf) voltage of 20-80 keV to yield ions of all the elements present. The ions are accelerated with a 24-kV dc potential, focused In an electrostatic sector, and dispersed according to mass;charge ratio in a magnetic sector for photographic or electronic detection and measurement. The technique Is highly sensitive: it can detect all the elements simultaneously including adsorbed gases. Furthermore, the spectrum is simple (consisting mainly of singly-charged positive ions), and sample preparation is minimal, requiring only 10-100 mg of solids for analysis. Some limitations include spark-sourre instability leading to nonuniform ion production) and the relatively poor sensitivity and reproduclbility of photographic plates used for detection and measure- ment, 172 U6 Brown et al. and Brown and Vossen reviewed research on solid- state mass spectrometry and presented analyses of particulars on membrane- filters. Table 13-1 lists 46 elements Including zinc, which were determined 172 in 2.65 mg particulates collected on a membrane filter. 445 image: ------- TABLE 13-1 Analysis of Particulate Matter from Mine Interior for Trace Elementsa Element Uranium Bismuth Lead Samarium 0.02 0.07 0.01 0.12 0.03 0.12 0.06 1.2 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.04 0.02 0.16 0.02 0.77 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.07 0.05 Element Gallium Zinc Copper Nickel Cobalt Iron Manganese Chromium Vanadium Titanium Scandium Calcium Potassium Chlorine Sulfur Phosphorus Silicon Aluminum Magnesium Sodium Fluorine Boron Lithium Concentration 0.18 1.1 2.3 2.0 210.0 0.01 0.02 1 79 aData from Brown et al.

Standardization with pure metal alkyls or chelates would be required. Only findings for lead tetraethyl were presented. The use of such metal-organic complexes has been proposed for gas chromatographic analysis. \"' Since zinc forms volatile chelates with a of 6-diketones such as 2,4-pentanedione, hexafluoro- 2,4-pentanedione , 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedione, 917 and 2-thio-2,4-pentanedione, it may be possible to determine zinc by mass spectrometry. Such determina- tions apparently have not been reported yet. Despite its broad capabilities, SSMS does not appear to have been used extensively to analyze airborne particulates. Voltammetry In common with other techniques requiring sample dissolution, buffering, and other wet-chemical processing, electroanalytic methods are not described in the air pollution literature as frequently as multielement techniques that require few sample manipulations. With such attractive features as high sensitivity and selectivity, low cost, and a modest multielement capability, voltammetry should be used more extensively in environmental analysis than it is. In voltammetry (polarography), current-voltage relationships measured during electrolysis are used to identify and quantitate the ions reacting 447 image: ------- at one of the electrodes (generally a dropping mercury electrode). Many variations of the basic technique have been developed, and instruments are available for conventional dc polarography, derivative dc polarography, cathode ray polarography, ASV, and ac, square wave, and pulse polarography. The various names refer to the types of voltage applied to the electrodes and the forms of data presentation. The highest sensitivity is afforded by ASV, in which the elements are plated from solution onto a cathodic electrode and then oxidized into solution by applying a voltage scan in the anodic direction. The peak currents arising from the oxidation of the ions of interest are measured to yield results down to nanogram and picogram concentrations in solution. 895 Landry described early work on polarographic zinc determinations 307 in the atmosphere. More recently, ASV has been used to determine trace amounts of zinc in airborne particulates: particles were collected on a membrane filter, which was ashed to destroy the filter and organic materials; the residue was digested in nitric and hydrofluoric acids. The solution was diluted and analyzed by stripping analysis, using 0.1 M potassium nitrate as supporting electrolyte, by plating at -1.2 V for 3 min, then scanning from -1.2 v to + 0.1 V against a standard calomel 3 electrode. Results for zinc were 0.020-0.93 yg/m ; they were compared with atomic absorption analyses carried out on the same samples. 989 Matson et al. used ASV to determine zinc in tissue, blood, urine, and hair below the nanogram level and found excellent agreement with results from AAS and NAA. Their technique employed perchloric acid digestion, addition of 0.5 M salt (Nad), 1 M sodium acetate, and 0.5 M ethylenediamine, plating for 30 min at -U3 V, and then stripping 448 image: ------- at 66 mV/sec to a potential of +0.1 V against a standard calomel electrode. The method should be suitable for analysis of particulates. To sum up, the variety of analytic methods and sampling procedures that have been used complicates comparing results from different investigators that might allow the testing of theories about zinc sources, atmospheric 823 transformations, or removal mechanisms. Katz has suggested the initiation of collaborative testing programs to evaluate the various analytic methods for specificity, selectivity, sensitivity, range, precision, and accuracy; however, very often these programs evaluate the capability of the operators rather than the analytic methods used. Von Lehmden et al. attempted to evaluate methods of analysis for coal, fly ash, fuel oil, and gasoline: 9 laboratories determined concentrations of zinc and 27 other elements in the same samples using SSMS, OES, INAA, AAS and ASV. Table 13-2 presents interlaboratory results obtained for these methods of analyzing zinc. Because the wide variations reported are a consequence of differences in sample handling and instrument operating procedure, results are difficult if not impossible to interpret. Comparisons of data from different laboratories (for example, the different literature cited in this chapter), could lead to erroneous conclusions. 449 image: ------- TABLE 13-2 a Collaborative Test Results for Zinc Determinations in Various Materials Laboratory 1 3 6 1 3 2 3 4 5 8 3 9 1 7 Method of Analysis b SSMS SSMS SSMS OESC ppm ppm 100 200 5 1,000 6.6 330 100 100 50 200 - - 100 - - 600 350 - \u2014 turn Fuel Premium Oil, Gasoline, ppm ng/ml 0.5 0.2 1.0 - 0.4 0.2 2.0 1.4 0.36 1.3 3.0 - - - - 2.0 1.0 0.12 Low-Lead Gasoline US/ml - 4.0 - - - 0.43 - - - - - - - 0.096 a 1705 Derived from von Lehmden et al. & SSMS - spark-source mass spectrometry Q OES - optical emission spectrography \" INAA - instrumental neutron activation analysis e AAS - atomic absorption spectrometry J\" DRES - dissolution followed by dc arc excitation in emission spectroscopy ^ ASV - anodic stripping voltammetry 450 image: ------- CHAPTER 14 SUMMARY PROPERTIES AND USES OF ZINC As the fourth most widely used industrial metal, zinc serves the consumer in a form not easily recognized in the end product. It is a corrosion protec- tion for steel (galvanizing); an alloying metal with aluminum, magnesium, and titanium in mass-produced precision parts (die-casting); an alloy with copper for brasses; a chemical for white paint pigment; and a vital ingredient in com- pounding rubber products. Zinc compounds have long been used pharmaceutically, although some newer applications in physiology and medicine are still being evaluated. NATURAL SOURCES AND DISTRIBUTION OF ZINC Zinc is found in most soils, but some areas are deficient in it. Differ- ences of zinc in soil and water can influence the zinc content of plants and animals found in these areas and in the products derived from them. MAN-MADE SOURCES OF ZINC Metallurgic operations, primarily mining and smelting of lead and zinc ores, contribute appreciable zinc contamination to air, water, and soil. However, this contamination is normally limited to areas near point sources. Few data are available on airborne concentrations of zinc near metallurgic operations. How- ever, evidence of elevated soil and vegetation zinc concentrations near these operations implies that airborne levels of zinc in these areas are or were appreciably elevated. The closing down of many older primary zinc operations has reduced environmental contamination and presumably new operations will have better particulate controls. 451 image: ------- Available data, although scanty, indicate that airborne zinc concentrations 2 in the United States away from point sources are generally low (less than 1 /ig/m ). Zinc in drinking water in the United States rarely exceeds the drinking water standard of 5 mg/1. Data are conflicting on the contribution of mobile sources to zinc contamination near roadways. If mobile sources do contribute markedly to the zinc roadside dust, the zinc probably is generated from zinc compounds in tires and motor oil. Sewage sludges also may contain high concentrations of zinc and other metals. Such sludges may not be suitable for indiscriminate use on agricultural land. Few data are available on the zinc content of solid wastes and the contribu- tion such waste may make to total environmental zinc levels. Information that exists on the quantity of zinc-65 released into waters from nuclear power plants would seem to indicate that levels are within acceptable limits. ZINC IN PLANTS Aquatic Plants Trace amounts of zinc are essential for normal growth and development of aquatic plants. Uptake of zinc is accomplished by ion exchange and metabolic assimilation processes. Aquatic plants can accumulate much more zinc by sorp- tion than is needed for metabolic activity. Rooted plants may take up zinc from sediments as well as from the ambient water, but zinc is usually accumulated by the plant in relative proportion to zinc in the ambient water. Zinc concentra- tion factors in plants as compared to the ambient water solution may range from a few orders of magnitude to 19,000. Therefore, zinc concentration of aquatic plants can range from a fraction of a ppm to several thousand ppm. Zinc con- centrations in aquatic plants vary seasonally, and the variation is probably caused by differences in availability and content of zinc in ambient waters as well as factors such as growth rate, supply of other nutrients, and temperature. 452 image: ------- Excessive levels of zinc in waters can bring on zinc toxicoses in aquatic plant communities. Tissue sampling and analysis techniques are being developed to establish threshold values for zinc toxicity to aquatic plants. The same analytic data may be used to determine the overall zinc nutritional status in aquatic plants. A primary function of zinc in aquatic plants is as a cofactor for several metalloenzymes and possibly as a stabilizer of the integrity of plant ribosomes. Aquatic plants (mainly algae) have been used extensively to elucidate the metabolic functions of zinc in plants. Terrestrial Plants The recognition of zinc deficiency and an understanding of essential func- tions of zinc in terrestrial plants have been commonplace since 1900, and zinc deficiency is now the most common micronutrient deficiency in the United States. Plants vary widely in sensitivity to zinc deficiency, toxicosis, and tolerance. Climatic and soil factors affecting zinc availability to plants are: amount of soil reserves; soil pH; extensiveness of root zones; microbial and soil organic matter content; soil temperature and moisture; and interactions with other elements. Most soil zinc moves to plant roots by diffusion\u2014convection plays a minor role. Soil intensity and capacity as well as availability of natural and synthetic chelating agents influence the movement of zinc to plant roots in soil. Zinc is taken up by plants as the divalent cation, and both active and passive uptake mechanisms are present. The active metabolic component is most important for continued zinc uptake by plants. Zinc is translocated in the xylem of plants as the divalent cation or as a weak metal-organic complex. Some zinc is redistributed from older to newer tissues through the phloem. Evidence exists for considerable interaction of zinc with phosphorus, iron, copper, and other elements in the plant. These interactions influence the rate and degree of zinc translocation. Zinc deficiency is often observed in plants that contain less than 20 ppm zinc; the normal plant concentration is 25-150 ppm zinc. Toxicosis 453 image: ------- often occurs at concentrations above 400 ppm zinc. Zinc deficiency can be overcome by foliar or soil fertilizer applications of soluble zinc salts. Zinc is intermediate in toxicity to plants among the heavy metals. Several species of plants that are extremely tolerant of high zinc concentrations in soil have been identified and provide an opportunity to establish vegetation on zinc-contaminated soils. The best defined role for zinc in plants is as an enzyme cofactor in various metalloenzymes. The greatest amount of research has been conducted on carbonic anhydrase, but the necessity of zinc to several metalloenzymes is well established. There is also evidence that zinc may function in stabilizing ribosomes. ZINC IN AQUATIC ANIMALS Although zinc is ubiquitous in aquatic organisms, the environmental and physiologic mechanisms controlling the biologic availability and accumulation of zinc in tissues are not well understood. In fresh fish muscle, zinc normally occurs in a concentration range of 3-30 ppm. Similar concentrations are observed in muscle tissue of many crustaceans and mollusks, particularly in those from open ocean waters. Organisms from coastal estuarine waters, however, tend to exhibit higher and more variable concentrations of zinc. Oysters have a partic- ularly high affinity for zinc, occasionally accumulating the element to more than 1,000 ppm. The highest concentrations in oysters are usually found in specimens from environments low in salinity. In mussels, scallops, and freshwater bivalve mollusks, zinc is strongly localized in certain organs, whereas in oysters the metal is rather uniformly distributed throughout all tissues. Fish, decapod crustaceans, and certain species of polychaete worms appear able to regulate tissue concentrations of zinc. Since aquatic organisms spend their entire lives immersed in a complex chemical milieu, it is difficult to distinguish dietary sources, integumentary exchange processes, and excretory and secretory mechanisms. An understanding of the 454 image: ------- physicochemical behavior of zinc in the aquatic environment is therefore a requisite for metabolic studies of aquatic organisms. Numerous studies have suggested that various chemical forms of zinc (including organic complexes) occur in natural waters, but their role in biologic accumulation and metabolism of zinc in organisms has not yet been defined. The disposal of industrial and municipal wastes in the aquatic environment has made zinc toxicosis a potential problem for aquatic organisms. Short-term acute toxicosis experiments have indicated that the median lethal concentration (LCc0) for some species may be in the range of 100-300 ng zinc/1. In fish, acute metal toxicosis has been attributed to precipitation of mucus on gills or to other cytologic damage to gill tissue. Systematic studies of the effects of environmental variation on toxic or sublethal effects of zinc have not been performed for most aquatic organisms. ZINC IN HUMANS Zinc is an essential element found in every human tissue and tissue fluid. trace only to iron. Among the/transition elements, the concentration of zinc in the body is second/ Approximately /90% of total body zinc is found in muscle and bone, but the highest concentration of zinc is found in endocrine glands, particularly the gonadal system, and in sensory receptors, particularly the retina of the eye. Only a small amount of total body zinc is carried in the blood, with the active fractions bound primarily to either albumin or amino acids, particularly histidine. Zinc is normally excreted in the urine bound to amino acids, but only a small fraction of the circulating zinc is excreted daily. Most dietary zinc is excreted in the feces as a result of lack of absorption or because of resecretion from bile. Zinc is a critical constituent of DNA polymerase. without it, protein synthesis does not proceed normally and cell division appears to be abnormal. Zinc deficiency in humans is commonly associated with abnormalities 455 image: ------- in those systems in which rapid cell division occurs; hence, growth retardation, hypogonadism, and abnormalities of the gastro-intestinal tract are common com- plaints. Zinc also appears to be particularly important for growth and develop- ment in utero and in early life. The specific manner by which zinc is transported across the gut is not known, but the process may involve the formation of a low molecular weight organic zinc chelate which moves across the gut primarily in several areas of the small bowel. Studies with zinc-65 suggest that about 65% of this isotope is absorbed by normal humans; however, there is an extremely broad range of absorption of this isotope, a phenomenon quite different from the absorptive characteristics of other trace metals. Zinc malabsorption, which occurs in several gastro- intestinal diseases, is associated with absorption of less than 30% of the zinc-65 presented orally. Although the specific functions of zinc in various organ systems are unclear, most systems appear dependent upon its presence. In the endocrine system, zinc is associated with the release of several pituitary hormones, the prolongation of action of adrenocorticotropin and insulin and an effect on prostate and testes that appears important in spermatogenesis. Many hormones influence zinc metabolism, and the bases of these changes are related to effects not fully understood. Zinc is involved in muscle function. Muscle represents the largest single body pool of zinc and the metal may be associated with potentiation of contract- ibility. Zinc is associated with key enzymes involved with the function of several organ systems, including liver and retina, and with vitamin and hematopoetic function. The association of zinc with alkaline phosphatase and the prominent role of this enzyme in the function of receptor membranes suggests a ubiquitous role for zinc. 456 image: ------- In sensory systems, the enzyme needed to convert retinol to retinal in the retina is zinc-dependent; hence visual processes are, in part, dependent upon this metal. In saliva, the zinc protein, gustin, may be important in the growth and differentiation of taste buds. With the isolation of taste bud receptor membranes from the cow, the zinc-dependent enzyme alkaline phosphatase appears to be the most highly concentrated enzyme; demonstration of specific bind- ing of sugars and other tastants to the isolated taste bud membrane are zinc- dependent. Zinc depletion in humans or animals is almost uniformly associated and taste loss, with anorexia conditions usually reversed following administration of zinc. Although zinc is the fourth most prevalent cation in all brain tissue, little is known of its function. Its location in the cerebellum and in the limbic system and the production of cerebellar dysfunction and mental dysfunction with acute zinc depletion in humans are well established. Severe mental aberrations in acutely zinc-depleted human subjects and poor performance in learning situations by animals made zinc-deficient suggest that zinc is associated with higher brain function as well as several neurophysiologic functions. ZINC IN THE DIET Zinc Deficiency Feeding animals diets low in zinc has decreased growth in all species tested. Other signs of zinc deficiency frequently observed in young animals are para- keratosis, hyperkeratinization, and impaired testicular development. Animals in less rapid stages of growth may have no signs of deficiency other than poor appetite and decreased growth. Wound healing has been impaired in adult animals on a low zinc diet; and reproduction, at least in the female rat, has been severely affected. Since food consumption is consistently reduced in zinc deficiency, some of the problems apparently caused by a low zinc intake are a secondary effect of decreased food consumption. 457 image: ------- Sources of Zinc and Amounts Required in the Diet Zinc in the diet primarily comes from protein. Meat, legumes, and whole grains are good sources of zinc. Zinc intakes considered adequate for various animals range from 20-50 mg/kg diet. Factors other than the actual content of zinc in the diet affect its adequacy, however, since deficiencies have developed in animals eating diets with presumably adequate amounts of zinc. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for adult men and women is 15 mg/day. Low protein diets are apt to have significantly less zinc than this. A higher intake is recommended during pregnancy and lactation. Since zinc deficiency in pregnant rats has caused congenital malformations, concern has been expressed that congenital malformations in humans might be a consequence of zinc deficiency. Malformations have only been obtained with diets extremely low in zinc and so far only in rats. Whether the results with rats would be obtained in other species is presently unknown. Interrelationships with Other Components of the Diet Phytic acid was one of the first constituents of plants to be linked to the decreased availability of zinc from plant sources. Other factors in plants affect zinc availability, but there is little information on them. High calcium levels in the diet aggravate symptoms of zinc deficiency, particularly in pigs; calcium does not have much effect, however, unless most of the protein in the diet is derived from plant sources, particularly seeds. Although interrelationships between zinc and vitamins such as biotin and minerals such as cobalt have been suggested, no vitamin or mineral additions have alleviated the symptoms of zinc deficiency. Additional histidine or histamine has alleviated the swollen hock condition that develops in zinc- 458 image: ------- deficient chicks/ although other symptoms of zinc deficiency in chicks were not affected. Occurrence of Zinc Deficiency Severe zinc deficiency caused by low zinc intake is rare. The incidence of marginal deficiency states is largely unknown because of the lack of a good method for assessing zinc status. Low hair zinc levels reported in some American school children suggest that marginal zinc deficiencies do occur. Apparent zinc deficiencies have also been reported in animals fed diets appear- ing to be adequate in zinc. Assessment of Zinc Deficiency Because the chief effects of low zinc intake \u2014 poor appetite and slow growth \u2014 may arise from many causes, a specific test is needed to diagnose zinc deficiency. Plasma and hair zinc levels have been used most frequently to assess the zinc status of humans and animals. Plasma zinc is limited in that it is affected by many things other than zinc intake. Hair zinc reflects zinc status only over fairly long times. Although both measures probably will be low in cases of severe deficiency, they may not be lowered in states of marginal deficiency. Metabolic Lesions in Zinc Deficiency Zinc deficiency results in decreased growth of most body tissues, although the effect does not seem to interfere with DNA synthesis per se. Indeed, mitotic activity increases in cells in the esophagus and buccal mucosa. Why mitotic activity should increase in a few tissues and decrease in most others is not known. Disturbances in sulfur metabolism, glucose metabolism, bone growth, and reproduction have also been reported. However, the extent to which these differences are caused by altered food intake or reduced growth of the deficient animal rather than the lack of zinc per s is unclear. 459 image: ------- Zinc in Wound Healing in Animals Although zinc has been implicated in more rapid healing of wounds, studies with animals indicate that additional zinc is of value only if the animal is zinc-deficient. There is no evidence that supplementation of zinc for zinc-adequate animals improves wound healing. ZINC IN METALLOPROTEINS Since 1940, when Keilin and Mann discovered the first zinc metallo- enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, the list of enzymes in which the functional or structural role of Zn(II) has been documented has increased considerably. Data on approximately 50 enzymes suggest that zinc may be involved as a necessary cofactor. Several metabolically important reactions are catalyzed by these enzymes, including hydrolysis, hydration, oxidation-reduction, and group transfer reactions. Detailed physicochemical data on several of the enzymes catalyzing hydrolysis or hydration reactions, e.g., carboxypeptidase A and carbonic anhydrase, show the zinc to function in its capacity as a Lewis acid by withdrawing electrons from a group of the substrate directly coordinated to the metal ion at a site initially occupied by solvent water. Zinc may also generate active, coordinated hydroxide ions at enzyme-active sites. In each case, the function of the Zn(II) as a Lewis acid is clearly only part of a concerted mechanism involving reactive side chains of the proteins in addition to the metal ion. Whereas such interaction may be the role of Zn(II) in the catalytic mechanism of a number of enzymes, the Zn(II) in superoxide dismutase and aspartate transcarbamylase does not appear to the interact directly with/substrate. Thus zinc may also function by maintaining the required conformation of a protein or by participating in the binding of effector molecules to allosteric enzymes. If, in addition to its functional role in we11-characterized zinc metalloenzymes, zinc is an absolute requirement 460 image: ------- for the function of the nucleotidyl transferase enzymes basic to DNA replica- tion and transcription, then the metal's fundamental role in molecular biology and at least some of the molecular reasons for the severe physiologic effects of zinc deficiency become clear. CLINICAL ASPECTS OF ZINC METABOLISM Because zinc is a cofactor in protein synthesis, it plays an active role in many disease processes. Severe liver disease is commonly associated with loss of total body zinc. In animals, zinc pretreatment has been associated with some protection from liver damage with several hepatotoxins. However, the role of zinc therapy in human liver disease is unclear. Gastrointestinal malabsorption from any cause is associated with decreased gut absorption of zinc and with the subsequent production of zinc deficiency. Although rare, acrodermatitis enteropathica is a severe systemic disease in which zinc malabsorption plays a role in patho- genesis. The symptoms of this disease disappear following exogenous zinc administration. Serum concentrations of zinc vary with several disease states, including several cancers, blood dyscrasias, infectious processes, and renal diseases. Various drugs alter zinc levels in blood and urine, as do peritoneal and blood dialyses of patients with uremia. Parenteral hyperalimentation is associated with decreased serum zinc concentration and increased urinary zinc excretion, a con- dition consistent with the production of zinc depletion. Zinc deficiency, as evidenced by total body loss of zinc, has been produced acutely in man following the oral administration of L-histidine; the symptoms produced by this body depletion of zinc are quickly obviated following exogenous oral zinc administration, even in the face of continued histidine administration. In animals, several studies have suggested that zinc may inhibit the growth of specialized tumors. There are no applicable data for humans, but changes in serum zinc concentrations accompany many malignant processes at various stages, 461 image: ------- Preliminary reports of the usefulness of zinc in the treatment of various medical disorders have appeared but have yet to be substantiated by controlled clinical trials. Claims have been made that schizophrenia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, laryngeal granulomas, gastric ulcers, and some forms of color blindness can be improved by oral administration of zinc ion. Zinc has been used as a therapeutic preparation for several centuries. It has been applied topically to treat skin disorders since ancient times and is still used for this purpose. Its capacity to produce gastrointestinal irritation is consistent with its use as an emetic. Oral administration of zinc has been used to assist in the more rapid healing of wounds of various types, but this therapy appears to be useful only in patients with signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency. Zinc has also been used to treat patients with taste and smell dysfunction of various types and, as in the wound healing studies, it is apparently of little value except in those patients with zinc deficiency. Be- cause zinc deficiency may be difficult to ascertain reliably, identification of patients at risk poses a difficult practical problem. TOXICITY OF ZINC Humans Zinc is not a highly toxic substance. Zinc toxicosis may occur only when very high dose levels overwhelm the homeostatic mechanisms controlling zinc uptake and excretion. Reports of zinc tolerance as well as toxicosis in humans are sparse, but they do suggest that 500 mg to 1 g or more may be ingested on a daily basis without adverse effects. Ten or more g taken as a single oral dose may produce gastrointestinal distress, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. There are also suggestions in the literature that even higher dosage may produce dizziness and perhaps increase blood levels of pancreatic enzymes. 462 image: ------- None of these observations of acute disorders have been rigorously studied under controlled conditions nor are they confirmed experimentally. Chronic zinc toxicosis in humans is even less well documented. Inhalation of zinc has been related to metal fume fever, an acute disability of short duration that can occur when fume is inhaled from metal heated to a temperature above its melting point. It is most commonly associated with inhalation of zinc oxide fume and is most severe among brass founders. It is characteristized by hyperpnea, shivering accompanied by fever, profuse sweating, pain in chest and legs, and general weakness beginning 4-8 h after exposure and lasting about 24-48 h. With repeated exposures, some degree of tolerance may be built up, but it will be lost when exposure to fume ceases for a period as short as two days. The pathogenesis of this disorder, including the role of zinc in it, is not understood. 463 image: ------- Animals Although animals have a high tolerance for zinc, problems have been reported in animals (particularly horses) grazing near lead-zinc smelters. Zinc intake of the order of 3,000 ppm (mg/kg body weight) was required to induce the symptoms experimentally. Most animals appear to tolerate levels up to 1,000 ppm in the diet without ill effects if the diet contains adequate copper and iron. High levels of zinc interfere with metabolism of these minerals; therefore anemia and increased serum cholesterol are likely if copper or iron intake is low. Interactions Between Zinc and Cadmium Zinc and cadmium have some physiochemical properties in common. There are, however, large differences between these two metals in biologic sys- tems: zinc is essential and has a short biologic half-time, and cadmium is not essential and has an extremely long biologic half-time. Zinc is found in high concentrations in most tissues, whereas cadmium mainly accu- mulates in kidney and liver. The cadmium- and zinc-binding protein, metal- lothionein, is the main storage protein for cadmium. Zinc easily crosses the placental barrier, whereas cadmium is practically excluded. Experiments with animals, in which cadmium concentrations in the diet often have been similar to or higher than the zinc concentrations, have shown that cadmium may accentuate symptoms brought on by zinc deficiency. Whereas zinc can counteract some actions of cadmium (such as weight loss), it does not influence anemias caused by cadmium. Exposure to cadmium will increase zinc levels in kidney and liver. When zinc intake is marginal, exposure to cadmium may cause some tissues, such as testes, to become depleted of zinc. Cadmium has been shown to 464 image: ------- interfere with many enzymes both In vivo and jLn vitro. Zinc may prevent some of these interferences, but not all. Limited data exist on zinc-cadmium interactions in human beings. The normal accumulation of cadmium in renal cortex will be accompanied by an equimolar increase in zinc, probably reflecting the metal content of metal- lothionein. From the available data, it can be concluded that for human beings who ingest enough zinc and who are not excessively exposed to cadmium, the main metal- metal interaction will take place in the kidneys, where about one-third of the total body burden of cadmium is stored. The cadmium concentrations in other parts of the body are probably too low to interfere greatly with zinc-dependent systems. As long as the amount of zinc necessary for normal function is not altered in the kidneys, cadmium should not cause any functional disturbances in that organ. Higher exposure to cadmium\u2014from industry or food\u2014will elevate cadmium levels and eventually cause renal damage. The few available data indicate that zinc stops increasing when cadmium levels become very high in the renal cortex. If zinc intake is marginal, then it can be postulated that zinc levels of some tissues may become depressed if the accumulation of cadmium in kidney and liver results in zinc storage there. A risk may be incurred for the fetus if pregnant women are exposed to cadmium without adequate zinc intakes. The danger lies not in a direct action of cadmium, but in the smaller amount of zinc available for the fetus. Usually animal products rich in protein are a good source for zinc, and cadmium concentrations are very low in meat. If vegetable protein sources replace meat, it can be expected that the zinc:cadmium ratios will not be so favorable. 465 image: ------- The World Health Organization has recommended that the weekly intake of cadmium in adults should not exceed 400-500 yg. This means a daily limit of about 70 pg of cadmium. It has also recommended that the concentration in drinking water should not exceed 5 yg cadmium/kg. If zinc supplements are added to human food, care must be taken that excessive amounts of cadmium are not added as well. Since not more than 10 yg (assuming 2 kg water/day) should be allowed from drinking water, less should be allowed from supplements. If zinc Is added to human diets, supplements should not cause an increase of more than 5 yg cadmium/day. There is thus need for strict control of zinc compounds used as food additives. STANDARDS FOR ZINC LEVELS Standards for zinc in air and water have been obtained using techniques which do not fully reflect available advanced technology. Zinc is ubiquitous and, as such, will be present in the environment forever. Continuous moni- toring of the environment is important to maintain a close check on the levels of zinc in air, water, and land. SAMPLING AND MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYZING ZINC Analysis of Samples from the General Environment Methods for evaluating zinc In media such as physiologic fluids, soft tissue, bone, hair, waters, soils, foodstuffs, and plants vary greatly in nature as to merits and disadvantages. Techniques include absorption spectro- photometry, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, neutron fluorescence, arc-emission spectrography, spectrofluorometry, and optical spectrography. Comparatively reliable and standardized methods for zinc in waters, soils, food- stuffs, and plants exist, but for biologic media, recommended routine methodology exists only for urine and serum. 466 image: ------- Methods of expressing zinc levels in various media vary considerably. They Include wet weight basis, dry weight basis, dry-ash weight basis, and per-unit biochemical reference such as protein, DNA, etc. Analysis of Zinc in the Air Modern methods for determining zinc in the atmosphere include absorption spectrophotometry, atomic absorption spectrometry, optical emission spectro- graphy, X-ray fluorescence instrumental neutron activation analysis, and voltammetry (polarography). The inclusion of activation analysis indicates the ready availability of nuclear reactors for carrying out routine analyses. Ring oven techniques have not been discussed because the results obtained are semlquantitatlve. The variety of analytic methods and sampling procedures that have been used complicates comparing results of different Investigators necessary to coordinate data to test theories of zinc sources, atmospheric transformations, or removal mechanisms. Because the variations reported are a consequence of differences in sample handling and Instrument operating procedures, results are difficult if not Impossible to interpret. Comparisons of data from different laboratories could lead to erroneous conclusions. 467 image: ------- CHAPTER 15 RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Areas of zinc deficiency and zinc excess in Soils and waters in the United States should be identified. 2. A systematic programofmonitoring air for zinc should be established. The sparseness of data on airborne zinc frustrates attempts to quantify and identify sources of zinc in the environment. A study designed to monitor airborne zinc levels both in the general community and near known point sources would greatly assist in determining the environmental impact of diverse zinc sources, 3. .Efforts^should bemade^to Controljzinc leveljs^ in zinc-containing was te- waters to avoid excessive contamination of sludges that will beadded to agricultural_J.ands. Many industrial and sewage sludges contain high levels of zinc. Since such sludges are sometimes used as fertilizers to provide nitro- gen, phosphorus, and micronutrients, efforts should be made to ensure that the addition of zinc to soil is not great enough to cause toxicoses in plants and excessive levels in feed and food. Con- taminated sludges should be disposed of in sanitary landfills or incinerated; they should not be applied to land indiscriminately. 468 image: ------- 4. Additional research should be conducted on the occurrence and characte- istics oforganic zinccomplexes in natural waters. Chemical complexing of zinc may affect the biologic availability of the metal to aquatic organisms. Naturally occurring physico- chemical forms of zinc should be distinguished in order to understand the mechanisms controlling zinc accumulation and metabolism in aquatic organisms. 5. Research is needed on the relation of zinc to aquatic plants. a. A broader range of zinc values and concentration factors are needed for many aquatic plant species to evaluate the impact of increasing doses and varied forms of zinc in ambient waters. Sampling and analysis techniques need to be refined to establish critical or threshold values for zinc toxicity and the overall zinc nutrition status in aquatic plants. b. The influence of biologic, chemical, and environmental factors in sediments and waters upon zinc content and movement into ambient waters, aquatic plants and ultimately the food chain should be studied further. c. The accumulated wealth of information on the functions of zinc in aquatic plants, especially green algae, should be used as a basis for more concentrated research on zinc in plant metabolism. Such an approach would be the most useful for expanding understanding of functions of zinc in plants. 6. Research isneeded on the relation of zinc to terrestrial plants. a. The specific mechanisms of zinc uptake and translocation at the molecular level need to be identified. 469 image: ------- b. Additional metabolic functions need to be characterized, because the roles identified to date require only a small fraction of the zinc needed for normal plant growth. c. The physiologic basis for differential zinc requirements among species needs to be defined. d. The mechanism of zinc-phosphorus interactions in plants needs to be determined. e. The chemical forms of zinc in soils controlling zinc levels in soil solution need to be determined. If this is done, soil solution levels can be monitored for normal plant growth and nutrition and deficiency and toxicosis can be more easily guarded against. f. Specific mechanisms of zinc deficiencies, toxicoses and tolerance in plants need to be identified. g. The processes of zinc redistribution within plants, especially the movement from vegetative tissue to seeds, should be determined. h. The basis of foliar absorption and movement of zinc in plants needs to be established. 7. Experiments on acute and chronic exposure of aquatic organisms to ele- vated zinc concentrations in aqueous systems should be undertaken on a systematic basis to determine the effects of zinc on vital life processes. The effects of zinc should be determined alone and in combination with other potential contaminants of human origin, such as cadmium. Studies should be conducted for various critical life stages under many combinations of important environmental interactions (salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen) over all ranges of 470 image: ------- variation to which the test organism is exposed naturally. Such a systematic approach is required to ensure adequate water quality standards for protecting aquatic organisms. 8. Research into the physiologic role of zinc in humans should be encouraged. Systems to be investigated should include the endocrine system, sensory systems, including vision and taste, muscle and the nervous system, including the central and peripheral nervous systems and behavior. 9. The following additional research on zinc in the diet is needed: a. A method of assessing zinc status of man and animals. There is no currently accepted method of determining whether or not an animal is receiving adequate zinc. b. The occurrence of marginal zinc deficiencies. Because of the lack of a method of determining zinc status, the prevalence of marginal zinc deficiency is completely unknown. c. The requirement for zinc and factors that affect the requirement. The data available for determining the amount of zinc required, particularly by man, are very limited. Since diets low in protein will not generally contain the 15 mg zinc recommended daily for adult humans, It is important to know how low an intake would be adequate. It has been suggested that additional zinc may be bene- ficial for both man and animals in times of stress, but more in- formation is needed. 471 image: ------- d. Factors affecting the availability of zinc. Reports of zinc deficiency in animals, particularly ruminants, fed diets con- taining presumably adequate zinc indicate the need for additional information on factors affecting the metal's availability. Almost no information exists on constituents of plants, other than phytate, that affect the availability of zinc. e. Content of zinc in food. Attempts to calculate the dietary zinc intake in man are hampered by the lack of adequate or accurate information in the literature. Additional data could be obtained readily with methods now available. f. Zinc and cadmium. Zinc requirements should be studied in human populations exposed to excessive cadmium. More studies should be conducted on the effect of prolonged exposure to small amounts of cadmium on zinc metabolism of animals on deficient, marginal, and zinc-adequate diets. Zinc metabolism and its relation to cadmium exposure in pregnancy especially should be studied. 10. The role, if any, of zinc in cancer should be investigated systematically. This examination should include an evaluation of changes in zinc metabolism that occur in various cancers and the role, if any, of zinc as an inhibitor of oancer growth. 11. The role, if any, of zinc deficiency in human fetal wastage and con- genital malformations should be investigated. 12. Efficacy of zinc therapy for various diseases should be evaluated through controlled, randomized, cooperative studies. Such trials could deal with the question of zinc treatment in wound healing, anorexia, and taste and small dysfunction. 472 image: ------- 13. Cadmium levels should be evaluated In preparations in zinc used as foodstuffs. 14. Standard reference materials and standard analytic methods for atmospheric participates should be developed. Such measures would permit analysts to check their results. The availability of standard materials and procedures would provide a means not only to evaluate the reliability of analytic methods, but also to compare data obtained in different laboratories from different samples at different times. 473 image: ------- APPENDIX A Zinc Content of Foodg- I.

However, con- centrations above 5 mg/1 can cause a bitter astringent taste and an opales- cence in alkaline waters. The zinc con- centration of U.S. drinking waters varies between 0.06 and 7.0 mg/1, with a mean of 1.33 mg/1. Zinc most com- monly enters the domestic water supply from the deterioration of galvanized iron and the dezincification of brass. In such cases the presence of lead and cadmium also may be suspected, because they are impurities of the zinc used in galvaniz- ing. Zinc also may result from industrial waste pollution. 1. Selection of Method Where the equipment is available, the atomic absorption spectrophotomct- ZINC ric meth'od is preferred for the determi- nation of zinc. The dithizone and zincon colorimetric methods are useful in the absence of the sophisticated in- strumentation. Dithizone method I is intended for unpolluted waters, and II for polluted waters or wastewatcr. 2. Sampling and Storage Analyze samples within 6 hr after collection. The addition of HCl will pre- serve the metallic ion content but re- quires that: (a) the acid be zinc-free; (b) the sample bottles be rinsed with acid before use; and (c) the samples be evap- orated to dryness in silica dishes to re- move the excess HCl before analysis. ^Copyright 1976 by the American Public Health Association. Reproduced with permission. 1311a 487 image: ------- Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometric Method 1. General Discussion a. Principle: Atomic absorption spectrophotometry resembles emission flame photometry in that a sample is as- pirated into a flame and atomized. The major difference is that flame photome- try measures the amount of light emit- ted, whereas in atomic absorption spectrophotometry a light beam is di- rected through the flame, into a mono- chromator, and onto a detector that measures the amount of light absorbed by the atomized element in the flame. For many metals difficult to analyze by flame emission, atomic absorption ex- hibits superior sensitivity. Because each metal has its own characteristic absorp- tion wavelength, a source lamp com- posed of that element is used; this makes the method relatively free from spectral or radiation interferences. Thus the amount of energy of the characteristic wavelength absorbed in the flame is pro- portional to the concentration of the ele- ment in the sample. b. Interference: Most metals can be determined by direct aspiration of the sample into an air-acetylene flame. The most troublesome type of interference is termed \"chemical\" and results from the lack of absorption of atoms bound in molecular combination in the flame. This can occur when the flame is not hot enough to dissociate the molecules (in the case of phosphate interference with magnesium) or when the dissociated atom is oxidized immediately to a com- pound that will not dissociate further at the temperature of the flame. The inter- ference of phosphate in the magnesium determination can be overcome by the addition of lanthanum. Similarly, the introduction of calcium eliminates silica interference in the determination of manganese. However, silicon and met- als such as aluminum, barium, beryl- lium, and vanadium require the use of the nitrous oxide- acetylene flame to dissociate their mole- cules. In addition, barium undergoes ionization in the flame and the ground state (potentially absorbing) population is thereby reduced. The addition of an excess of a cation (sodium or potassium) having a similar or lower ionization po- tential will overcome this problem. The wavelength of maximum absorption for arsenic is 193.7 nm, and for selenium 196.0 nm. Unfortunately, the air-acety- lene flame absorbs intensely at these wavelengths. The sensitivity of the method for these metals can be im- proved by the use of the argon-hydrogen flame, in the determination of mercury by the cold vapor (flameless) technic, certain volatile organic materials may absorb at 253.7 nm. If this is expected, the sample should be analyzed by the regular procedure and again under oxi- dizing conditions only, that is, without the addition of stannous chloride. The true mercury concentration can be ob- tained by subtracting the two values. c. Sample handling: Before collecting a sample, decide on the type of'data de- sired, i.e., dissolved, suspended, total, or extractable metals. This decision will de- termine whether the sample is to be acidified, with or without filtration, and the kind of digestion required. Acidify all samples at the time of col- lection to keep the metals in solution and to minimize their adsorption on the con- tainer wall. If only dissolved metals are to be measured, filter the sample through a 0.45-/xm membrane before acidification. If possible, filter and acid- ify in the field at the time of collection. Report the results obtained on this sample as \"dissolved.\" Filtration is not necessary when total or extractable con- centrations are required. Acidify the sample with cone HNOa to a pH of 2.0 or less. Usually, 1.5 ml cone HNOa/l sample will be sufficient for potable waters free from paniculate matter. Such samples can be analyzed with no further treatment. However, samples containing suspended materials or organic matter require pretreatment, as described below. 488 image: ------- 2. Apparatus a. Atomic absorption spectropbo- tmneter, consisting of a source of light emitting the line spectrum of an element (hollow cathode lamp), a device for va- porizing the sample (usually a flame), a means of isolating an absorption line (monochromatoror filter and adjustable slit), and a photoelectric detector with its associated amplifying and electronic \"measuring equipment. Both direct cur- rent and alternating current systems are used in atomic absorption instruments. The AC or chopped-beam system is preferred because with this system flame emission can be distinguished from lamp emission. For waters high in salt, the use of either a deuterium background cor- rector or a double-beam instrument that permits the measurement of the absorp- tion at two different wavelengths simul- taneously may be helpful. b. Burner: The most common type of burner is known as a premix, which in- troduces the spray into a condensing chamber for removal of large droplets. The burner may be fitted with a con- ventional head containing a single slot 7.6 cm (3 in.) long, which is most useful for aspiration when organic solvents are used; a three-slot Boling head, which is preferred for direct aspiration with an air-acetylene flame; or a head contain- ing a single slot 5 cm (2 in.) long for use with nitrous oxide and acetylene. c. Recorder: While most instruments are equipped with either a digital or null meter readout mechanism, a good- quality 10-mV recorder with high sensi- tivity and a fast response time is needed to record the peaks resulting from the determination of mercury by the rold vapor (flameless) technic and for the de- termination of arsenic and selenium by aspiration of their gaseous hydrides. d. Hollow cathode lamps: Use one for each element being measured. Multi- element lamps are available but not rec- ommended because they may require the selection of different operating pa- rameters. e. Pressure-reducing valves: Main- tain the supplies of fuel and oxidant at pressures somewhat higher than the controlled operating pressure of the in- strument by suitable reducing valves. Use separate reducing valves for each gas. / Vent. Place a vent about 15 to JO cm (6 to 12 in.) above the burner to re- move the fumes and vapors from the flame. This precaution protects the labo- ratory personnel from toxic vapors, pre- vents the stability of the flame from being affected by room drafts, and pro- tects the instrument from corrosive va- pors. A damper or variable-speed blower is also desirable for modulating the air flow and preventing disturbance of the flame. 3. Extractable Metals Analyses \"Extractable metals\" include metals in solution plus metals lightly adsorbed on the suspended material. The results obtained in analyses for ex tractable met- als will be influenced by the kind of acid or acids used in the digestion, the con- centration of acid, and the heating time. Unless conditions are controlled rigidly, results will be meaningless and unre- producible. The following procedure de- termines metals soluble in hot HC1- HNOs. At the time of collection, acidify the entire sample with 5 ml cone HNOa/1 sample. At the time of analy- sis, mix the sample, transfer a 100-ml portion to a beaker or flask, and add 5 ml 1 +1 redistilled HC1. Heat 15 min on a steam bath. Filter and adjust the volume to 100 ml. The sample is then ready for analysis. The data approximate the total met- als in the sample, although something less than the actual total is measured. Concentrations of metal found, espe- cially in heavily silted samples, will be substantially higher than results ob- tained on only the soluble fraction. Re- port as \"extractable\" metals. 489 image: ------- Determination of Zinc by Direct Aspiration into an Air-Acetylene Flame 1. Apparatus See abo**a for a description of the required atomic absorption spec- trophotometcr and associated equip- ment. The three-slot Boling burner head is recommended. 2. Reagents a.

Procedure . a. Instrument operation-. Because of differences between makes and models of satisfactory atomic absorption spectro- photometers, it is not possible to formu- late instructions applicable to every in- strument. In general, proceed according to the following steps: 1) Install a hollow cathode lamp of the desired metal in the instrument, set the wavelength dial according to Table 301 :II, and align the lamp in accord- ance with the manufacturer's instruc- tions. 2) Set the slit width according to the manufacturer's suggested setting for the element being measured. 3) Turn on the instrument and apply the amount of current suggested by the manufacturer to the hollow cathode lamp. 4) Allow the instrument to warm up until the energy source stabilizes; this process usually requires 10 to 20 min. Readjust the current as necessary after warmup. 5) Install the burner heads. 6) Turn on the air and adjust the flow rate to that specified by the manu- facturer to give maximum sensitivity for the metal being measured. 7) Turn on the acetylene, adjust the flow rate to the value specified, and ig- nite the flame. 8) Atomize deionized distilled water acidified with 1.5 ml cone HNOa/l, and check the aspiration rate over 1 min. Adjust if necessary to a rate between 3 and 5 ml/min, and zero the instrument. 490 image: ------- 9) Atomize a standard (usually a 0.5- mg/l standard is suitable) and adjust the burner both up and down and side- ways until a maximum response is ob- tained. 10) The instrument is now ready to operate. When analyses are finished, ex- tinguish the flame by turning off first the acetylene and then the air. b. Standardization: I) Select at least three concentrations of each of the standard metal solutions (prepared as in 2b above) so as to bracket the expected metal concentra- tion of a sample. Aspirate each in turn into the flame and record the absorb- ance. 2) For calcium and magnesium cali- bration, mix 100 ml of standard with 25 ml of lanthanum solution (see 2/above) before aspirating. 3) For iron and manganese calibra- tion mix 100 ml of standard with 25 ml of calcium solution (see 2c above) before aspirating. 4) With some instruments, it may be necessary to convert percent absorption to absorbance by use of a suitable table generally provided by the manufacturer. 5) Prepare a calibration curve by plotting on linear graph paper the ab- sorbance of the standards versus their concentration. 6) Plot calibration curves for iron and manganese based on the original con- centrations of the standards before dilu- tion with calcium solution (H2c). 7) Plot calibration curves for calcium and magnesium based on the original concentration of the standards before di- lution with lanthanum solution (1f2/). 8) Recheck the calibration curve by aspirating at least one standard after the completion of the analysis of a group of unknown samples. c. A na lysis of samples : 1) Rinse the atomizer by aspirating deionizcd distilled water containing 1.5 ml cone HNOa/1, and zero the in- strument. 2) Atomize the sample and determine its absorbance. 3) When determining calcium or magnesium, dilute and mix 100 ml sample with 25 ml lanthanum solution fl|2/> before atomization. 4) When determining iron or manga- nese, dilute and mix 100 ml sample with 25 ml calcium solution (1|2f) be- fore atomization. 4.

Most interferences in the zinc-dithizone reac- tion can be overcome by adjusting the solution to pH 4.0 to 5.5 and by the ad- dition of sufficient sodium thiosulfate. Zinc also forms a weak thiosulfate com- plex that tends to retard the slow and in- complete reaction between zinc and dithizone. For this reason, the determi- nation is empirical and demands the use of an identical technic in standard and sample analysis. The duration and vigor of shaking, the volumes of sample, so- dium thiosulfate, and dithizone, and the pH should all be kept constant. b. Interference: Interference from bis- muth, cadmium, cobalt, copper, gold, lead, mercury, nickel, palladium, silver, and stannous tin in the small quantities found in potable waters is eliminated by complexing with sodium thiosulfate and by pH adjustment.

Set up another funnel containing 20 ml zinc-free water as a blank. 2) Add 2 drops methyl red indicator and 2.0 ml sodium citrate solution to each funnel. If the indicator is not yel- low, add cone NhtaOH a drop at a time until it just turns yellow. Add 1.0 ml potassium cyanide solution and then acetic acid, a drop at a time, until the in- dicator just turns a neutral peach color. 3) Extract the methyl red by shaking with 5 ml CCU. Discard the yellow CCU layer. Add 1 ml dithiocarbamate solution. Extract with 10 ml dithizone solution, shaking for 1 min. Draw off the CCU layer into another separatory funnel and repeat the extrac- tion with successive 5-ml portions of dithizone solution until the last one shows no change from the green dithi- zone color. Discard the aqueous layer. 4) Shake the combined dithizone ex- tracts with a 10-ml portion of sodium sulfide solution II, separate the layers, and repeat the washing with further 10- ml portions of NazS solution until the unreacted dithizone solution has been removed completely, as shown by color of the aqueous layer, which remains col- orless or very pale yellow; usually three washings are sufficient. Remove water adhering to the stem of the funnel with a cotton swab and drain the pink CCU solution into a dry JO-ml volumetric flask. Use a few mil- lilitcrs of fresh CCU to rinse the last droplets from the funnel and dilute to the mark with fresh CCU. 5) Determine the absorbance of the zinc dithi/.onatc solutions at 535 nm, us- ing CCU as a reference. Plot an absorb- ance-concentration curve after sub- tracting the absorbance of the blank. The calibration curve is linear if mono- chromatic light is used. 6) Clean separatory funnels by shak- ing several minutes successively with HNOs, distilled water, and finally a mixture of 5 ml sodium citrate and 5 ml dithizone, to minimize the large or er- ratic blanks that result from the adsorp- tion of zinc on the glass surface. If pos- sible, reserve separatory funnels exclusively for the zinc determination and do not use for other purposes. b. Treatment of sample-. 1) Digest sample as directed under Preliminary Treatment, Section 301C.II. Transfer a portion containing 10 to 40 /*g Zn to a clean 125-ml separatory funnel and adjust the vol- ume to about 20 ml. Determine the zinc in -this solution exactly as described in the preceding procedure for preparing the calibration curve. If more than 30 ml of dithizone solu- tion is needed to extract the zinc com- pletely, the portion taken contains too much zinc or the quantity of other met- als that react with dithizone exceeds the amount that can be withheld by the complexing agent. In the latter case, fol- low the procedure in U 42) below. 2) Separation of excessive amounts of cadmium, copper, and lead\u2014When the quantity of these metals, separately or jointly, exceeds 2 mg in the portion taken, in a 100-ml beaker adjust the volume to about 20 ml.

Calculation mg/l Zn = MgZn 100 ml sample ml portion Zincon Method* 1. General Discussion a. Principle: Zinc forms a blue com- plex with 2-carboxy-2'-hydroxy-5'-sul- foformazyl (zincon) in a solu- tion buffered to pH 9.0. Other heavy metals likewise form colored complexes. Heavy metals, including zinc, are com- plexed by cyanide. Chloral hydrate is added specifically to free the zinc from its cyanide complex. The zinc-zincon complex is measured before other heavy metal-cyanide complexes are destroyed by chloral hydrate. Sodium ascorbate reduces the interference of manganese. The final solutions are unstable and the procedure is designed to minimize the effects of color fading. b. Interference: The following ions interfere in concentrations exceeding those listed: Ion Cd (II) Al (III) Mn(H) Fe(III) Fe(H) mg/l I 5 y 7 9 Ion Cr (III) Nidi) Cu(II) Co (II) CKMII) mg/l 10 20 30 JO 50 c. Minimum detectable quantity: 1 MgZn. 2. Apparatus Colorimetric equipment: One of the following is required: a. Spectrophototneter, for measure- ments at 620 nm, providing a light path of 1 cm or longer. b. Filter photometer, providing a light path of 1 cm or longer and equipped with a red filter having maxi- mum transmittance near 620 nm. De- viation from Beer's law occurs when the filter band pass exceeds 20 nm. 3. Reagents a. Zinc-free water, for rinsing of ap- paratus and preparation of solutions and dilutions. Prepare as directed in Section 323C.3\u00ab. b. Stock zinc solution: Prepare as di- rected in Section 323C.3\u00bb. c. Standard zinc solution: Dilute 10.00 ml stock zinc to water; 1.00 ml= 10.0 fig Zn. Potassium cyanide solution: Dis- solve 1.00 g KCN in 50 ml zinc-free water and dilute to 100 ml.

Bring each volume to 10.0 ml by adding zinc- free water. To each flask add, in se- quence, mixing thoroughly after each addition, 0.5 g sodium ascorbate, 1.0 ml KCN solution, 5.0 ml buffer solution, and 3.0 ml zincon solution. Add 3.0 ml chloral hydrate solution, note the time, and mix. Transfer to the absorption cell and measure the absorbance at 620 nm exactly 5 min after adding the chloral hydrate solution. Use the treated blank as the reference solution for initial bal- ancing of the photometer. For greater accuracy in the range below 10 Mg Zn, prepare a separate calibration curve. b. Treatment of samples: If dissolved zinc is to be determined, filter the sample. If total zinc is to be determined, add 1 ml cone HC1 to 50 ml thoroughly mixed sample and mix well. Filter and adjust to pH 7 with 6NNaOH. Trans- fer a 10.0-ml portion of sample contain- ing not more than 70 Mg Zn to a 50-ml erlenmeyer flask. Complete the analysis as described in If 4a above, beginning with the words \"To each flask add, in sequence . . . ,\" and continue to the end of the paragraph. Prepare as a reference solution a sample portion treated as above, except that 3.0 ml zinc-free water is substituted for the 3.0 ml chloral hydrate. Use this to compensate for color, turbidity, or in- terference not eliminated by the proce- dure. Prepare as nearly simultaneously as possible with the sample portion. 5.

ABSTRACT This report summarizes the available information on zinc as it relates to its effects on man and his environment. Zinc is found in most soils, but some areas are deficien in it. Metallurgic operations contribute to zinc contamination in air, water and soil Trace amounts of zinc are essential for normal growth in plants, animals and humans, however, excessive levels can bring on zinc toxicosis. Zinc deficiency is known to have caused congenital malformations in pregnant rats. Severe liver disease is commonly associated with loss of total body zinc. Zinc is not a highly toxic subs- tance. Zinc toxicosis may occur only when very high dose levels overwhelm the homeo- static mechanisms controlling zinc uptake and excretion. Reports suggest humans may ingest 500 mg to 1 g or more daily without adverse effects. Ten or more g taken as a single oral dose may produce gastrointestinal distress, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. There are also suggestions in the literature that even higher dosage may produce dizziness and perhaps increase blood levels of pancreatic enzymes. Inhalation of zinc has been related to metal fume fever, an acute disability of short duration that can occur when fume is inhaled from metal heated to a temperatur above its melting point. With repeated exposure, some degree of tolerance may be built up, but it will be lost when exposure to fume ceases for a period as short as two days. The pathogenesis of this disorder, including the role of zinc in it, is no 17. KEY WORDS AND DOCUMENT ANALYSIS DESCRIPTORS b.IDENTIFIERS/OPEN ENDED TERMS c.
