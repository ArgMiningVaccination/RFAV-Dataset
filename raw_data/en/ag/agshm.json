But distinguishing between acid reflux and bile reflux is difficult and requires further testing. You're also likely to have tests to check for damage to your esophagus and stomach, as well as for precancerous changes. Tests may include: - Endoscopy. A thin, flexible tube with a camera (endoscope) is passed down your throat. The endoscope can show bile, peptic ulcers or inflammation in your stomach and esophagus. Your doctor may also take tissue samples to test for Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer. - Ambulatory acid tests. These tests use an acid-measuring probe to identify when, and for how long, acid refluxes into your esophagus. Ambulatory acid tests can help your doctor rule out acid reflux but not bile reflux. In one test, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a probe at the end is threaded through your nose into your esophagus. The probe measures the acid in your esophagus over a period of 24 hours. In another test called the Bravo test, the probe is attached to the lower portion of your esophagus during endoscopy and the catheter is removed. - Esophageal impedance. This test measures whether gas or liquids reflux into the esophagus. It's helpful for people who regurgitate substances that aren't acidic (such as bile) and can't be detected by an acid probe. As in a standard probe test, esophageal impedance uses a probe that's placed into the esophagus with a catheter. Treatment Lifestyle adjustments and medications can be very effective for acid reflux into the esophagus, but bile reflux is harder to treat. There is little evidence assessing the effectiveness of bile reflux treatments, in part because of the difficulty of establishing bile reflux as the cause of symptoms. Medications - Ursodeoxycholic acid. This medication may lessen the frequency and severity of your symptoms. - Sucralfate. This medication can form a protective coating that protects the lining of the stomach and esophagus against bile reflux. - Bile acid sequestrants. Doctors often prescribe bile acid sequestrants, which disrupt the circulation of bile, but studies show that these drugs are less effective than other treatments. Side effects, such as bloating, may be severe. Surgical treatments Doctors may recommend surgery if medications fail to reduce severe symptoms or there are precancerous changes in your stomach or esophagus. Some types of surgery can be more successful than others, so be sure to discuss the pros and cons carefully with your doctor. The options include: - Diversion surgery. During this type of surgery, a doctor creates a new connection for bile drainage farther down in the small intestine, diverting bile away from the stomach. - Anti-reflux surgery. The part of the stomach closest to the esophagus is wrapped and then sewn around the lower esophageal sphincter. This procedure strengthens the valve and can reduce acid reflux. However, there's little evidence about the surgery's effectiveness for bile reflux. Self care Unlike acid reflux, bile reflux seems unrelated to lifestyle factors. But because many people experience both acid reflux and bile reflux, your symptoms may be eased by lifestyle changes: - Stop smoking. Smoking increases the production of stomach acid and dries up saliva, which helps protect the esophagus. - Eat smaller meals. Eating smaller, more-frequent meals reduces pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, helping to prevent the valve from opening at the wrong time. - Stay upright after eating. After a meal, waiting two to three hours before lying down allows time for your stomach to empty. - Limit fatty foods. High-fat meals relax the lower esophageal sphincter and slow the rate at which food leaves your stomach. - Avoid problem foods and beverages. Some foods increase the production of stomach acid and may relax the lower esophageal sphincter. Foods to avoid include caffeinated and carbonated drinks, chocolate, citrus foods and juices, vinegar-based dressings, onions, tomato-based foods, spicy foods, and mint. - Limit or avoid alcohol. Drinking alcohol relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter and irritates the esophagus. - Lose excess weight. Heartburn and acid reflux are more likely to occur when excess weight puts added pressure on your stomach. - Raise your bed. Sleeping with your upper body raised 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) may help prevent reflux symptoms. Raising the head of your bed with blocks or sleeping on a foam wedge is more effective than is using extra pillows. - Relax. When you're under stress, digestion slows, possibly worsening reflux symptoms. Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation or yoga, may help. Alternative medicine Many people with frequent stomach problems, including heartburn, use over-the-counter or alternative therapies for symptom relief. Remember that even natural remedies can have risks and side effects, including potentially serious interactions with prescription medications. Always do careful research and talk with your doctor before trying an alternative therapy. Preparing for your appointment Make an appointment with your doctor if you have signs or symptoms common to bile reflux. After your doctor's initial evaluation, you may be referred to a specialist in digestive disorders (gastroenterologist). Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment and what to expect from your doctor. What you can do - Write down any symptoms you've been experiencing and for how long. - Make a list of your key medical information, including any other conditions for which you're being treated and the names of any medications, vitamins or supplements you're taking. - Find a family member or friend who can come with you to the appointment, if possible. Someone who accompanies you can help remember what the doctor says. - Write down questions to ask your doctor. Creating your list of questions in advance can help you make the most of your time with your doctor. Don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment. Some questions to ask your doctor include: - Do I have bile reflux? - What treatment approach do you recommend? - Are there any side effects associated with these treatments? - Are there any lifestyle or dietary changes I can make to help reduce or manage my symptoms? - I have other health conditions. How can I best manage them together? What to expect from your doctor Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may give you time to go over points you want to spend more time on. You may be asked: - What are your symptoms? - How long have you had these symptoms? - Do your symptoms come and go or stay about the same? - If your symptoms include pain, where is your pain located? - Have your signs and symptoms included vomiting? - Does anything seem to trigger your symptoms, including certain foods or beverages? - Have you lost weight without trying? - Have you seen a doctor for these symptoms before? - What treatments have you tried so far? Has anything helped? - Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions? - Have you had stomach surgery or had your gallbladder removed? - What medications are you taking, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, vitamins, herbs and supplements? - What is your typical daily diet? - Do you drink alcohol? How much? - Do you smoke? Jan 06, 2022 - Townsend CM Jr, et al. Stomach. In: Sabiston Textbook of Surgery: The Biological Basis of Modern Surgical Practice. 20th ed.
