Can we find and strengthen the inner core of who we are? Can we rediscover our inner equilibrium and tranquility without retreating from the world? Ever since ancient times, people have sought to reestablish inner balance by using various meditative practices. The \"soul exercises\" described in this brief book are derived from Rudolf Steiner's spiritual philosophy, while also acknowledging the Buddhist tradition and mindfulness meditation. Offering strategies to boost self-confidence, self-reliance, inner stability, and concentration, they are intended for anyone seeking personal inner development. These exercises are perfect for enriching daily life, and can be of help especially during times of stress, mental and emotional crisis, burn-out, and in the context of psychiatric and psychosomatic therapies. In a series of short chapters, illustrated with beautiful color photos, this book offers accessible, easy-to-follow commentaries and instructions for creating a path of inner development and balance.
