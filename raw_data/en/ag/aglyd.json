Special T ake Care of Y our Heart Edition SEE INSIDE New section A Better Tomorrow helps older adults live well2 Loma Linda University Health A Healthy Tomorrow ask the EXPERTask the EXPERT When should I see a cardiologist? A: Do you know your risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease? Do you know how to optimally manage those risk factors when they place you at risk? If you answered no to one or both of these questions, then you should set up an appointment to see a cardiologist. A cardiologist is a physician who specializes in primary and secondary prevention and treatment of these risk factors. Additionally, if you personally have had a diagnosis of coronary artery disease or valvular heart disease or an arrhythmia, then make sure you check in regularly with your cardiologist to ensure that you remain optimally treated. fyi Smoking, high cholesterol and being overweight increase your chance of having a heart attack. WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW About Heart Attacks Can Hurt You Aman clutches his chest and doubles over. Heart attack, you say. But what about the woman who's been feeling unusually tired and is experiencing nausea and back pain? She, too, could be having a heart attack. People often miss signs of a heart attack or ignore them, assuming something else is the problem. But acting fast at the rst sign of heart attack symptoms can save lives and limit heart damage. WHY THE CONFUSION? Heart attack symptoms vary. Even people who have had a heart attack may experience di erent symptoms during another one. Plus, men's and women's symptoms may di er. Chest discomfort or pain is the most common symptom of a heart attack in both men and women. Th e sensation may range from pressure or fullness to squeezing, crushing pain. It may be constant or come and go. SYMPTOMS MAY BE VAGUE While chest pain is common, both men and women may experience other symptoms. W omen, particularly, are more likely to experience subtle signs such as: Pain in the back, neck, jaw or stomach. Nausea. Light-headedness. Abnormal fatigue. Breathing problems.Dr. Anthony Hilliard is an interventional cardiologist at the International Heart Institute.

For example, every time there's a commercial break, perform one of these term couch potato with someone who is inactive and spends most of their time watching TV . But unfortunately, there's more to it than just that. STUDY LINKS BLOOD CLOT RISK TO INCREASED TV TIME For a new study, more than 15,000 U.S. adults chose the category that best represented how frequently they watch TV: /uni25A0Never. /uni25A0Seldom. /uni25A0Sometimes. /uni25A0Often. /uni25A0V ery often. Researchers then monitored the participants for two decades and tallied how many experienced venous thromboembolism (VTE), a condition in which a blood clot forms in a vein. /T_h e results revealed that people who answered that they watch TV very often were almost twice as likely to develop VTE compared with those who never or seldom watched TV . SITTING, BINGE WATCHING AND BLOOD CLOTTING For those who may be thinking, \"I'm healthy and exercise a lot so I don't need to worry about blood clots\" \u2014 think again. In the same study, researchers found that individuals who met a recommended level of physical activity still had a higher risk for blood clots when they spent hours in front of their TVs. Sitting on the couch for a prolonged period of time can cause blood to get trapped in your lower extremities. /T_h is may lead to the development of blood clots, which, in turn, can result in a life-threatening condition called pulmonary embolism.WATCH LESS AND LIVE LONGER TV TIME IS A LIFE-THREATENING GUILTY PLEASURE FIND THE RIGHT DOCTOR Whether you need a primary care physician or a specialist, you can nd a good match by calling 1-844-203-2272. Or, if you're watching a show that doesn't have commercials, assign each of the above exercises to a speci c character's action. For example, if you're watching /T_h e O c e , do 10 lunges every time Michael makes a joke. For more ideas about how to reduce your risk for blood clots, talk with your healthcare provider.Realizing that you're being controlled or hurt is the rst step to escaping. One in three women and one in ve men are victims of domestic violence at some point. Th e problem, which arises when one partner controls or abuses the other, occurs in every culture, age group, socioeconomic level, educational background and religion. Abuse can take many forms: Physical abuse, such as hitting, kicking or assault with a weapon. Sexual abuse, by forcing a partner to perform a sexual activity he or she doesn't want to do. Emotional abuse, such as threats, constant criticism and put-downs. Restrictive abuse that includes controlling the person's activities, contact with others and access to money.SIGNS OF ABUSE Because abuse can take many forms, it's not always easy to recognize. But if you feel you must constantly watch what you say and do around your partner to avoid a tantrum, the relationship could be abusive. Ask yourself some questions: Are you afraid of your partner? Has your partner ever hurt or threatened you or someone you care about? Does your partner ever force you to take part in sexual activities that make you uncomfortable? Do you constantly worry about your partner's moods and change your behavior to deal with them? Does your partner try to control what you do and where you go? Have you stopped seeing family and friends due to your partner's jealousy? Does your partner threaten to commit suicide if you leave? Does your partner say his or her temper is out of control because of alcohol, drugs, an abusive childhood or another excuse? If you answered yes more than once, you're likely in an abusive relationship. STEPS TO TAKE Try to have a cellphone accessible at all times. But be aware that cellphones can contain tracking devices your partner could use to nd you if you leave. Y ou need not face abuse alone. Seek help and support from someone you trust \u2014 a friend, relative, religious adviser, doctor or mental health professional. Y ou can also call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). If you're in danger or have been assaulted by your partner, call 911 or the police. For more information, visit the National Domestic Violence Hotline at thehotline.org .Domestic violence can take many forms.

Do I have a deadline to meet?SEEK HELP In the extreme, excessive clutter can be a symptom of a hoarding disorder, which is often linked with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-de cit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression. People with this condition are apt to be indecisive and have great di culty throwing anything away. Th ere are multiple types of help for people with hoarding disorders, including self-help books, support groups, individual talk therapy, medications and group therapy. Speci c strategies to treat hoarding include challenging the hoarder's thoughts and beliefs about the need to keep items, practicing going out without buying new items, teaming up with a professional to sort and reduce clutter and developing a plan to prevent future hoarding. Living in a constant state of disorganization can be stressful. T aking steps to clear your clutter is well worth your time and e ort.THE TRUTH Behind NUTRITION MYTHS NUTRITION MYTH: A gluten-free lifestyle will help me lose weight. NUTRITION FACT: A gluten-free diet is not a weight-loss diet. For people who have celiac disease \u2014 about 1 percent of the population \u2014 it is dangerous to eat gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. Other people eliminate gluten for a variety of reasons, such as gastrointestinal issues, sensitivity to gluten or a wheat allergy. For many other people, a gluten-free lifestyle simply represents a healthy lifestyle. But it turns out that when it comes to nutrition, there is no advantage to gluten-free foods. What's more, a gluten-free diet is not intended to help you lose weight and may actually lead to an insu cient intake of certain vitamins, minerals and ber. There's a lot of incorrect information out there. Distinguishing nutritional fact from ction can help you meet your goals. NUTRITION MYTH: Carbohydrates will sabotage your waistline. NUTRITION FACT: The right kind of carbohydrates can be part of a healthy diet. All carbs aren't created equal. Th ere are two types of carbohydrates \u2014 simple and complex. Simple and re ned carbohydrates are the kind found in white rice, white fl our and sugar; they're rapidly digested and send your blood sugar soaring and then plummeting. Th is roller-coaster e ect causes you to crave more food. Try to eat fewer of these foods. Complex carbohydrates are broken down by your body more gradually. As a result, you stay satiated for a longer period of time. So ll up on these foods, including oats, brown rice, whole wheat bread, whole-grain cereal and pasta as well as legumes (beans, lentils and dried peas), fruits and vegetables. NUTRITION MYTH: Eliminating fat from your diet will help you slim down. NUTRITION FACT: Lower-fat foods often contain as many as, or more, calories per serving compared with their full-fat counterparts. When manufacturers subtract fat from a food, they often replace it with other ingredients, such as sugar, salt, fl our or starch to improve the taste or texture, which tacks on waist-widening calories. Try to pay attention to the type of fat that a food contains. Saturated and trans fats increase your risk for serious health issues, such as heart disease and stroke. Th ey're found in foods like butter, cheese, fried foods, cakes, cookies and more. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can help protect your heart. Find these fats in plant-based oils, avocados, peanut butter, nuts and seeds. FIND THE RIGHT DIET . WE CAN HELP .

Think of it as a name game. Oils, spreads and other foods high in saturated fats , including cheese and butter, increase the levels of \"bad\" cholesterol in your blood, which can lead to heart disease. So can trans fatty acids , or trans fats. Fats that have the word unsaturated in their name can help lower cholesterol when used in place of saturated and trans fats. These include spreads and oils, such as olive oil, that contain polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. Choosing Cooking Oils Nontropical vegetable oils are the best to use when cooking and preparing food \u2014 and there are a lot to choose from. Healthy oils include: Canola Olive Corn Sunflower Avoid tropical oils, including coconut oil \u2014 they're high in saturated fat. Butter vs. Margarine Soft margarine is the better option.
