I have used Dr. Katherine Monahan, ND over the past two years for all sorts of issues and challenges (ranging from COVID to vertigo) that exceeded western medicine's tools. Each time she was a fantastic resource. She is kind, listens attentively and is wise in her careful assessments and recommendations. I trust her fully as she will defer if she feels she is not as expert in any certain area and that gives me great confidence in the advice she does give. She works over the phone and zoom and is easy to communicate with about anything. I am so grateful. I use a handful of alternative healthcare practitioners. Dr. Monahan is one and such a valued resource for me and many of my friends. Call her and start a conversation! - Sep 14, 2020 I have worked with Katherine for about 9 months -- and it has been a transformational experience. She is a wildly talented ND. With a complex health history, she has taken painstaking care to understand my holistic health picture and we are unraveling it together. She asks smart questions, is both caring and compassionate, but unafraid to tell it like it is -- and give it to you straight. Katherine is whip smart, extremely knowledgeable, takes great care to do her research, and has a love of learning so she is always current and at the cutting edge of her field. She created a well-thought out, custom plan addressing my whole health picture. She takes great care to explain everything, has a cautious approach and ensures comfort before doing anything. For the first time in years, I have lost a good amount of weight, started cooking, adopted new mindful practices, and am making progress towards getting my body in balance. It has been a gift to work with Katherine and give her my very highest recommendation. If you have any question in your mind as to whether you should call her, the answer is \"absolutely, yes\" - Dec 28, 2020 I have been working with Dr. Katherine Monahan, ND and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a naturopathic health-care provider. Dr. Monahan listens carefully to your health history and experiences and collaborates with you to create a comprehensive treatment plan designed to optimize your health and promote your body's natural healing process. She takes a caring and holistic approach that includes emotional support, professional-grade supplements, diet and nutrition, and stress management and exercise. Dr. Monahan has been treating my Graves' disease and after a few months of working with her my condition is in remission and I feel much better physically. I now look forward to continuing to work with her on other aspects of my total wellness. - Mar 28, 2020 I was very nervous about getting a second gum surgery since the first had resulted in extreme bruising and swelling that lasted for days. Before going in again I contacted Dr. Monahan and she gave me a full regimen of vitamins and supplements that I started taking a week before my surgery. As a result I had literally no bruising or swelling this time. I will definitely turn to Dr. Monahan in the future, she is compassionate, very professional and clearly had a significantly positive impact on my recovery. - Mar 25, 2020First to Review Dr. Monahan was incredibly professional, thorough and attentive, developing a comprehensive treatment regimen that provided immense relief of symptoms. Highly recommend.
