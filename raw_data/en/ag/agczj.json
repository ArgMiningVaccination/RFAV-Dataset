Do you realize that the COVID vaccine approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) is different than the one being injected into your arm? The vaccine can also transform your body into a magnet. And the injection includes a microchip so the government can track your whereabouts. None of the above statements are true, but a belief in these myths is just part of the reason why over 40 percent of the U.S. population is [not yet fully vaccinated ](https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/vaccine-tracker)against [COVID-19](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/coronavirus-disease-2019). Predictably, vaccination refusal is closely aligned with a belief in other conspiracy theories, including the notions that the virus was a planned government plot, or a hoax, or that certain groups are prospering because of the pandemic (Oleksy et al., 2021). According to some studies, [10 percent of the unvaccinated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7636457/) are afraid of injections, and many others decline vaccination based on general [mistrust](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/trust) of government mistrust or religious convictions. However, others believe that accepting the vaccination represents surrender to a grand conspiracy scheme designed to strip individuals of their personal freedom and redesign the architecture of the world. Conspiracy theories are typically defined as \"secret plots by powerful and malevolent groups\" (Douglas et al., 2017) that are nearly impossible to debunk because a conspiracy believer always has a reason why conflicting opinions and opposing evidence are wrong. Conspiracy theories are based in part on believing misinformation. The impact of misinformation is immense: Individuals who believe false information are 70 percent more likely to share false information on social media than to share facts, thereby further escalating the problem (Vosoughi et al., 2018). The cost of harboring misinformation about vaccinations has obvious health and economic implications. Those who are unvaccinated are more likely to become seriously ill or die from a COVID-19 infection, they tend to engage in more risky behaviors (e.g., unessential travel), and are more likely to transmit the COVID-19 virus. Since 2016, a wealth of research has been conducted to determine why some people cling to conspiracy theories leading to vaccine refusals while others comply with scientifically supported recommendations. One common explanation is the tendency of people to believe attitude-consistent information while rejecting information that is attitude-discrepant (sometimes referred to as \" [confirmation bias](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/motivated-reasoning)\"). In other words, we share information that supports our political [persuasion](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/persuasion) (Knobloch-Westerwick & Kleinman, 2012) and patently ignore or reject divergent opinions. However, studies reveal that individuals who are lower in cognitive ability, regardless of political party, are equally prone to sharing false information (Sanchez & Dunning, 2021). Anti-vaccination reasons confirmed by science To understand the relationship between misinformation, conspiracy theories, false beliefs, and anti-vaxxing behaviors, we must examine other traits and attitudes: 1. To been seen as unique. Vaccine hesitancy and conspirator ideology are related to several [personality](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/personality) traits. These traits include a grandiose view of the self, perceived self-importance, presenting oneself as habitually correct, and appearing to show little concern for other perspectives. In combination, these traits parallel many descriptions of narcissists (Kay, 2021). Individuals who believe they possess proprietary knowledge think that the knowledge makes them an expert, which in their minds is a catalyst to earn admiration and respect from others (Lantian et al., 2017). Ultimately, the more unique we feel, the greater the likelihood that we will embrace conspiracy theories. 2. To display an anti-conformity identity. Part of feeling special is related to rejecting popular ideas and being disagreeable. In some cases, people reject \"normality\" to the extreme and base their entire existence around an anti- [conformity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/conformity) ideology. These self-perceived disruptors incorporate the rejection of conventional ideas into everything they do. They want to be seen as free spirits who have a defined life purpose and as people who cannot be manipulated by tradition, rules, or societal expectations. In the words of science [denial](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/denial) expert Lee McIntyre (2021), the anti-vaxxer is \"bound together by a common persecution,\" which helps them gravitate toward others with similar beliefs. When it comes to identity, the reason for the belief becomes more important than the belief itself. 3. For the love of drama and risk. Some people intentionally seek out the absurd because they find it entertaining, amusing, and a way to escape the tedium of their daily lives (van Prooijen et al., 2021). Folks who endorse conspiracy theories may find enjoyment in bizarre beliefs because those beliefs can subtly reduce [anxiety](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/anxiety) about the world by redirecting their thoughts away from reality while reducing feelings of unrest. Others are motivated by situations and opportunities that evoke high emotions. For some, adherence to the anti-vaxxing mentality provides a psychological payoff that generates intense feelings of [emotion](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/emotions) (both high and low) which may be absent from other areas of their lives. 4. To bond. The ability to connect with other like-minded individuals is a primary need for humans. [Bonding](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/attachment) with similar others helps us feel empowered and cultivates feelings of [confidence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/confidence) because the individual's views are encouraged and supported by their in-group. Banding together with similar individuals promotes a positive [self-image](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/identity) and shifts the blame for problems to those outside of the person's inner circle (Douglas et al., 2017). Bonding is an especially strong motive for those who feel marginalized or threatened, feelings that many anti-vaxxers are likely experiencing based on restricted access rules and testing that are not required for the vaccinated. For many individuals and groups, social planning decisions are based entirely on whether their friends and family have similar vaccination views. 5. To foster feelings of control and closure. Many people have a need for predictability because knowing what happens next helps them feel safe and secure. The pandemic revealed that we have very little control over the containment of a virus. When uncertainty prevails, people feel [stressed](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/stress), anxious, and powerless. Thus, we are compelled to take psychological action to exert feelings of controllability. Staking a vaccination claim, in essence, eliminates uncertainty and enhances self-verification. When we commit to an opinion, we concurrently reduce mental conflict because, in our minds, the issue is resolved. Based on the theory of [cognitive dissonance](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/cognitive-dissonance) (Festinger, 1957), in most cases, people tend to feel better about their decisions after the decision is made. In addition, many individuals have a high need for closure (Kruglanski & Webster, 1996). Making a no-vax decision achieves closure and satisfies the need to have definitive knowledge on how to respond to an unpredictable virus. 6. Not everyone is analytical. Ample research indicates a relationship between a belief in misinformation, lower levels of [education](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/education), a diminished need for complex thought, and impulsivity (Douglas et al., 2017). The basis for the connection among these factors is not related to [intelligence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/intelligence), and we should not imply that people who are vaccinated are \"smarter\" than those who are unvaccinated. What we should conclude is that thinking about the merits and consequences of a vaccination decision is hard work. For many of us, it's much easier to reach a definitive and quick \"yes\" or \"no\" decision than it is to engage in cognitive aerobics to try to reason through the best decision. However, the consequences of snap judgment and a lack of reasoning can be lethal, as evidenced by the death-bed confessions and admissions of poor [decision-making](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/decision-making) by many of the unvaccinated. Finally, we must recognize that although there are patterns among various beliefs, traits, and anti-vaxxing behavior, we cannot conclude that any one factor causes people to go unvaccinated. Likely a combination of interacting factors together provides a better explanation than any single factor alone. Thus, in your personal quest to identify anti-vaxxers and help eliminate their susceptibility to misinformation, avoid fixation on any one of these characteristics.
