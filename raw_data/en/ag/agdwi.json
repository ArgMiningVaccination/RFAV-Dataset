A Doctorate in Naturopathic medicine is obtained at a four-year medical school, focusing on both classroom and clinical training. Naturopathic doctors are required to pass a series of Board exams in order to become licensed doctors. While trained to diagnose and treat disease in the same manner as conventional physicians, naturopathic doctors often choose to treat the patient and disease differently. First, they identify and treat the root cause of a problem, rather than simply treat symptoms. When practicing naturopathy, a doctor treats the patient as a whole, considering all aspects that may contribute to illness or prevent healing. Naturopathic doctors educate and empower their patients to prevent disease through healthy lifestyle choices and natural interventions. Naturopathic treatment can work alone or together with other approaches. While conventional medical tools involve mostly drugs and surgery, naturopathic doctors are trained in a variety of therapeutic tools: herbal medicines, supplements, vitamins, clinical nutrition, homeopathy, counseling, acupuncture, pharmacology, and physical medicine.
