It is the Department of Defense operations subsidiary of the Collaborative Health Initiative Research Program (CHIRP) established between the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and USU. Since inception, TAGC has generated 40,000 whole Genome Sequences across 107 research studies sourced from NHLBI, other NIH Institutes, DoD and USU investigators. TAGC is also the sequencing center and genome data analysis center for the APOLLO Cancer Moonshot project, and collaborates for this purpose with the Murtha Cancer Center (MCC) at Walter Reed, the National Cancer Institute, and the Veterans Administration. More About TAGC > DEPARTMENT OF LABORATORY ANIMAL RESOURCES The Department for Laboratory Animal Resources (DLAR), accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC), is dedicated to supporting successful research and education for USU. Our commitment to excellent animal care and welfare is accomplished through regulatory compliance, veterinary medicine, animal husbandry, surgical support, procurement, and protocol consultation services. BIOINFORMATICS The USU Biomedical Informatics System develops data and biological repository capabilities for USU that catalogs research projects and synergizes data resources across the university into an integrated data repository with a standardized vocabulary. This biomedical informatics system aims to be scalable and cost-effective with uncompromising data integrity and security. With sophisticated data analytics capabilities, USU researchers will be able to cross query the research data repository to identify variations in research outcomes, novel biomarkers and treatment modalities, and increasingly sensitive diagnostics to improve the health of warfighters and their families. Through hands-on precision and medical data analytics, USU researchers can derive insights from and produce meaningfully comparable results across all USU studies. The Assistant Vice President for Technological Research and Innovation, Biomedical Informatics Systems Unit's (TRI-BISU) mission is to develop data and biological repository capabilities for USU that catalogs research projects and synergizes data resources across USU into an integrated data repository with standardized vocabulary. BISU provides biomedical informatics support for USU researchers with hands-on precision medicine data analytics and produces relevant, comparable results across USU studies. The TRI-BISU delivers biomedical informatics support for USU researchers to cross query the research data repository to identify perturbations in research outcomes, identifying biomarkers, new ways of treatment, and more sensitive diagnostics with the vision to improve the warfighter and their families' health. Goals: - Develop and sustain a data and biological resources to support relevant USU biomedical research. - Deploy a user-friendly interface to access study metadata with querying power to reference phenotypes, test and other collected data across multiple studies simultaneously. USU faculty, staff and students - Provide a rapidly responding interface that simplifies querying and returning meaningful research biorepository results. - Build a data repository utilizing common medical vocabulary, allowing for query returns of information for formulating new hypotheses from the research information system - Apply biomedical informatics data analytics to identify early perturbations in research data, identifying potential biomarkers for new treatment targets and development of more sensitive diagnostics. 4D BIO\u00b3 The 4-Dimensional Bioprinting, Biofabrication, and Biomanufacturing (4D of advanced bioprinting, biofabrication, and biomanufacturing technologies. 4D Bio\u00b3 includes a 4,000 ft\u00b2multi-tool facility includes a biofabrication suite, tissue culture room, bioreactor and sensor facility, and medical/surgical simulation room.
