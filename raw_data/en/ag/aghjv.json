By tradition, the student processional was led by the chair of the Medical College Assembly and representatives of Up state Student Govern- ment, which this year included chief faculty marshall Kaushal Nanavati, MD, HS '99, MPH '14, Adham '17. Graduates were hooded by marshalls Amit Dhamoon, MD '07, PhD '06, and Lazarus Gehring, MD, representing the College of Medicine and Martha Wojtowy, PhD, and Cynthia Mor row, MD, representing the Masters of Public Health (MPH) program. The 2017 commence- ment included remarks from Mantosh Dewan, MD, interim dean of the College of Medicine, student speakers Amanda Ghanie, MPH '17, and Ramzi El-Hassan, MD '17, Richard Cantor, MD '76, president of the Medical Alumni Foundation, and Upstate President Danielle Laraque-Arena, MD. The keynote address was given by honorary degree recip-ient Michael R. Barratt, MD, a NASA physician and astronaut and one of the nation's few specialists dually trained in medicine and aerospace medicine. The College of Med- icine conferred 172 de grees: 147 MD, 21 MPH, and 4 MD/MPH degrees. More than 60 percent of this year's graduating class will remain in New York for the next phase of their physician training, with 17 students remain ing at Upstate for residency and another six training at St. Joseph's Hospital and Health Center in Syracuse. Sixty-three percent of the class will begin residencies in primary care, which includes family practice, general pediatrics and internal medicine \u2014 areas in medicine where physi-cian shortages are be coming particularly acute.

The initiative began two years ago among a group of students taking the Physicians and Social Responsibility elective after a lecture and discus-sion involving Medicaid, which provides health coverage to low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people with disabilities. The program is funded jointly by states and the federal government, but reimbursement rates are historically low, and as many as one in three phy- sicians do not accept Medicaid, making access to care especially difficult for these patients. \"After class readings and discussions, we were inspired to try to make a change beyond the level of our individual choices,\" says Emily Commesso, MD '17. \"We sought to serve patients with Med-icaid and to inspire our classmates to share the responsibility.\" The result was a 165- word pledge to commit to not overlook those on Medicaid when seeing patients and was made available for fourth-year students to sign during their last months of medical school. \"Since our first day as medical students when we receive our white coats, we pledge to do no harm and not discriminate in our care and to treat all individuals with respect,\" Commesso said. \"This pledge continues that spirit and encourages social responsibility for some of our most vulner-able patients.\" In addition to Com messo, graduating students involved in the initiative included Kyle Angelicola- Richardson, MD '17, Nadya Dillon, MD '17, MD Brielle Stanton, MD '17, and Jun Yu, MD '17. The 1 in 5 Pledge: In 2017, approximately 1 in 5 Americans is part of the Medicaid program. Traditionally, this group of Americans has been underserved in their access to medical care. If every physician took on patients with Medicaid as a small portion of their client base, the gap in access would be closed, and the health of our nation would rise. In the course of practice as physicians, we will strive to serve those in need, regardless of their Medicaid status. We will strive to uphold the traditional pillars of medicine: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice. In doing so, we believe it is wrong to fail to serve an entire group of people based solely on their socioeconomic status. As a class, our specialties will reach far and wide, and our careers as physicians will touch thousands of lives. Even if in a small way, it is our hope that as a class we can make a difference through the choices we make and the patients we serve.

He will also join the University Executive Committee in overseeing the leadership and management of the univer- sity at large. Licinio brings nearly 30-years experi- ence in academic medicine and a record of success leading academic programs of training, research, patient care and com munity engagement, both nationally and internationally. Licinio came to Upstate from the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, in Adelaide, Australia, where he served as deputy director of translation strategy and process for the Head, Mind and Brain Theme, as well as the Matthew Flinders Distinguished Professor at Flinders University in Adelaide. He also established the South Australian Brain Translational Research Program that has secured funding for research in multiple areas. Areas of work in his program, included neurobiology of the stress response, genetics and pharma- cogenetics of depression, promoting resilience and wellbeing, looking at approaches to generate human seroto- nergic neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and molecular imaging of the spinal cord. Previously, while at UCLA, he led a multidisciplinary team of Hispanic/Latino physicians, nurses, social workers, and assistants who recruited and developed a program of research and community engagement funded by multiple grants from six NIH Institutes and Centers. NIH-funded research projects included \"Developing Educational Approaches to Genetics for Mexican-Americans in East Los Angeles,\" \"Community Consultation and Haplotype Pharmacoge- nomics Research Group (focused on depressed Mexican-Americans).\" At the University of Miami (UM), Licinio was awarded NIH funding to create the \"Graduate Training Program in Translational Investigation,\" to develop an interdisciplinary training program in translational investigation that included a master's in translational science and also started the Clinical and Translational Science Institute. He also served as chair of the Department of Psychiatry and as chief of the psychiatric service at Jackson Memorial Hospital, the largest hospital in the United States. As professor and director of the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australia National University, Licinio established the first graduate training program in translational medicine in the Asia-Pacific region. He also has held positions at Yale University; Veterans Affairs Medical Center, West Haven, Connecti cut; NIH Clinical Center and the National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland.Licinio's research focus is depression, investigating stress-related circuits, circadian rhythms, genetics, pharma- cology, and pharmacogenomics. His scholarly accomplishments are notable for 300 publications, cited 20,952 times (h-index: 66). In his more recent work, Licinio has published with 190 colleagues from 54 institutions, located in 19 coun- tries, including Nobel Laureates Andrew Schally and Rita Levi-Montalcini. \"His work in translational medicine and his broad global perspective is espe-cially important to Upstate and positions him well to meet the challenges of aca - demic medicine in this new century,\" Laraque-Arena says. \"I am delighted to join the SUNY Up state community and to be able to con tribute to further enhance our trai ning, research, clinical, and community service programs,\" says Licinio. \"I believe that our motto should be 'research to improve your life.' This means that the research we do, while expanding fundamental knowledge, should ulti- mately be targeted to help people and communities, not only at some point in the distant future, but more immediately. The generation of new knowledge and translation of groundbreaking research progress to improved healthcare requires immense levels of training and workforce development and that is what Upstate is all about.\" In addition, he says, \"While doing our best to excel in our training, research and clinical missions, we have to keep in mind that we are a key part of the Central New York community, and therefore we have to always remember that commu- nity service is an indispensible part of our mission. What distinguishes the medical care we provide is the combina- tion of being the only academic medical center in the region, the largest local provider of health providers, and also of being a state-owned institution that sees community service as our major driver.\" Julio Licinio, MD/PhD4 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017COURT YARD Tucker Named Director of Adult Ambulatory Services AMY L.

Numann, MD '65, Honored for Lifetime of Achievement PATRICIA J. NUMANN, MD '65, the Lloyd S. Rogers Professor of Surgery Emerita at Upstate Medical University and a SUNY Distinguished Teaching Professor Emerita, has received the 2017 Lila A. Wallis Women's Health Award from the American Medical Women's Association (AMWA). The award is given to an individual whose lifetime achievement, accomplishments, motivation, men torship, energy and enthusiasm for women's health, education, and research reflect the trailblazing achieve- ments and influences in women's health exemplified by Dr. Lila A. Wallis, one of AMWA's past presidents. Dr. Numann, the first woman surgeon in Syracuse, has served on the board of numerous orga- nizations that advocate for women's care and has served as chair of the American Board of Surgery and president of the American College of Surgeons. She is founder of the Association of Women Surgeons and has supported women surgeons and women's health internationally. Numann's clinical and scien- tific interests focused on breast disease and thyroid and para-thyroid disease, a commitment reflected in the establishment of the Patricia J. Numann Breast & Endocrine Surgery Center at Upstate in 2007. Patricia J. Numann, MD '65 Strategic Plan Launched as Road Map to Propel University Forward A new sweeping strategic plan seeks to propel the university forward to greater excellence by addressing 15 key objectives aimed at increasing access, improving health outcomes, reducing health disparities, and increasing the university's reputation for excellence. Named OUR (One University Road Map) Upstate, the strategic plan impacts all aspects of university oper-ations, from technology to financial stewardship, inno-vation to quality improvement. \"This strategic plan is deliberately called a 'One University Road Map' because it unites us as one university and brings us together in our common purpose,\" says Upstate President Dani- elle Laraque-Arena, MD. \"It is the road map\u2014 anchored by data\u2014to guide us in our decision making, enabling us to respond adroitly to new opportunities, leveraging our strengths, and positioning Upstate on the path to effectively improve the health of individuals and the populations we serve.\"Most importantly,\" she adds, \"this plan addresses how we will reach our vision of being united in expertise, compassion and hope in the creation of a healthier world for all.\" The 15 strategic objectives of the plan are to: n Improve Health Outcomes n Reduce Health Disparities n Increase Access n Increase Reputation for Excellence n Improve Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency n Improve Financial Performance n Improve Efficiency and Accountability n Increase Integration n Grow Programs and Community Partnerships n Improve Quality n Enhance Innovation n Optimize Technology, Facilities and Support Services n Improve Culture of Trust n Increase Diversity, Equity, Access and Inclusion n Increase Workforce Satisfaction UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 7 When second-year medical students began their studies in August with a unit on cancer, they not only learned about disease processes and pharmacological treatments, but also integrative therapies such as herbal medicine and acupuncture. And when they study the gastrointestinal system in a few months, they will learn about nutrition and food as medicine. Second-year students will also par- ticipate in a 90-minute session on mindfulness and wellness, both as models to use with patients, but more immediately, to help with their own self-care to coun- teract the stresses of medical school. \"In addition to student wellness, which we're very concerned about, we know that patients are sometimes looking for alternative approaches to care and it's impor-tant for students to be able to distinguish between inte-grative approaches that have a scientific basis and other alternative therapies,\" says Thomas Poole, PhD, assistant dean for found ational science and associate professor of cell and developmental biology. \"We haven't previously had much of this in the curri culum, so in adding this content, we're hoping to benefit both students and their patients in understanding what approaches are evidence-based and might be complementary with Western medicine.\" The new material, part of a larger revamping of the curriculum, is part of other efforts to introduce aspects of integrative medicine into the Upstate Medical University educational and clinical expe- rience, reflecting an increased emphasis on health and wellness, both at Upstate and in American healthcare. In large part, they have been spearheaded by Kaushal B. Nana- vati, MD, HS '99, MPH '14 assistant professor of family medicine and director of integrative medicine.Adding to the ToolboxThe inclusion of integrative medicine brings new options for self-care and treatment.8 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017Built for Wellness Upstate's new Health and Wellness Center will open in 2021 Upstate Medical University hopes to make an even greater impact on the health of the greater Syracuse commu- nity with a new Health and Wellness Center, planned to open in the summer of 2021. The Health and Wellness Center will bring ambulatory care services currently dispersed throughout the city into one location. The Center, to be located across from the Cancer Center, will include pri- mary care clinics; global health services; behavioral health services, the Joslin Dia-betes Center; cardiology and pulmonary clinics; and Women's health, including the Breast Center and radiology services. Construction of the building is sup- ported by a $70.6 million grant from New York's Capital Restructuring Financ - ing Program and $70.6 million in match-ing funds allocated in the 2016-2017 New York State budget. According to Susan Furtney, ambulatory services administrator, Upstate was awarded the grant through the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Program, also known as DSRIP, which aims to fun-damentally restructure the health care delivery system by reinvesting in the Medicaid program, with the primary goal of reducing avoidable hospital use by 25 percent over five years. \"Our goal is to improve the health of our community by transforming how we deliver care,\" Furtney says. \"By integrat - ing primary care, behavioral health, spe- cialty services, and social supports in one location, we hope to reduce fragmenta- tion and promote multidisciplinary care.\" But the building will be much more Dr. Nanavati, who has been board certified in integrative med- icine through the American Board of Integrative and Holistic Medicine and in family medicine through the American Academy of Family Physi- cians, left private practice and joined Upstate in 2011 to build an integrative medicine program at Upstate that encompasses education, clinical care, and research in line with the institution's mission, and to create more community engagement and awareness. \"At the time, there were more than 50 medical schools teaching integrative medicine in their curricu- lum, and we weren't officially doing that,\" says Nanavati, who is excited to see that change. \"It's really fantas- tic that we're going to be progressive and make it a part of the mainstream. Whereas some institutions have inte- grative medicine as a separate course, adding to the student course load, the approach we've embraced is to incor- porate it as a part of the continuum, engaging with the patient, history taking, communication skills, and then approaches to care and healing.\" This fall, standard lectures within the first- and second-year curricu-lum were added that focus on inte-grative approaches to care and self care. In the third year, good evi- dence in integrative modalities is incorporated as a part of the clerk- ship curriculum, and a month-long elective in integrative medicine is offered to fourth year students. Nanavati says it's important to understand that integrative medi-cine is different from complementary and alternative medicine. \"Integra- tive medicine is conventional medi- cine plus complementary modalities that are rooted in evidence,\" he says. \"People do a lot of things that are not evidence-guided and call them 'alternative practices,' but the idea of integrative medicine is to use the rigors of the scientific method to optimize our knowledge and to guide patients to ways that can best help them heal.\" Dr. Nanavati leads a guided meditation session during Tranquility Tuesday.Nanavati points to integrative modalities used at most major med- ical centers, such as acupuncture for pain management, nutritional coun-seling, and use of meditation. His own efforts at Upstate began at the Cancer Center, where he works with complementary service pro- viders (such as acupuncturists and nutritionists) and consults with indi-vidual patients on integrative care approaches. \"The areas I like to focus on are wellness and health promo-tion, which goes beyond preven- tion to teach people how to live well through nutrition, physical exer-cise, stress management, and spiri- tual wellness,\" says Nanavati, whose book on the topic, The Core 4 of Well-ness, was published last year. \"I work with patients to help optimize their nutrition based on their particular health and health conditions, to help them understand the value of physical exercise and how much to do; to recognize the things they need to focus on that they can do something about and things they may stress about that they can't control directly; and help them understand what contentment and peace in their lives is, which can change over time.\" He also sees patients with autoim- mune disorders, chronic conditions for which there may not be a quick and easy fix. \"Patients often self-refer as they become more interested in learning how they can optimize their self-care and self-management and not feel so dependent on the system,\" he says. He's not alone in his efforts. Other Upstate physicians who have become board certified in integrative medi- cine include pediatric rheumatologist Caitlin Feuerstein, MD '84, HS '87. \"In my field, helping people with their lifestyle can often get to the root of their problem instead of just treating the symptoms,\" she says. \"That's what I'm trying to do with integrative medicine. I try to help patients with stress reduction, and diet and nutrition. It's really just being a good doctor.\" Students are expressing interest in the field through a robust Integra-tive Medicine Interest Group, which sponsors regular speakers, panel dis-cussions, workshops, and community outreach events to encourage aware- ness of integrative medicine. Fourth-year student Eric Reed spent the summer working with Nanavati between his first and second years of medical school, helping co-author a chapter on lung cancer for the fourth edition of the text- book Integrative Medicine, which was released in May. \"The literature is becoming more robust,\" says Nana- vati, whose efforts aren't all focused on students and patients. Last year, Nanavati began Tran- quility Tuesdays, a half-hour of guided meditation held the first Tuesday of every month open to anyone on the Upstate campus. The sessions became so popular that this fall they became weekly. \"It's our effort to promote self-care and well- ness in the workplace so that we can be more effective in our role in help- ing to heal,\" he says. n UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 9 than a collection of outpatient clinics. Designed to emphasize \"wellness,\" the eight-story, 320,000-square-foot building will include open and bright stairwells, and \"walking trails\" designed for patients, staff, and physicians to walk various distances if they follow a prescribed path. \"The idea is to help integrate wellness activities into everyone's daily routine within the new center,\" she says. In addition, the building will have an integrative medicine clinic that will offer complimentary therapies, and includes plans for designated open space for com- munity wellness activities such as yoga classes, meditation, and lectures, as well as group counseling sessions. The progressive environment will also include an outdoor garden space and a teaching kitchen. \"The business model for doctors and hospitals has historically been dis- ease oriented, whether it be prevention, man- agement, or innovation,\" says Kaushal B. Nana-vati, MD, HS '99, MPH '14, assistant professor of family medicine and director of integrative medicine. \"But simply following and monitoring disease is expensive in terms of U.S. healthcare. We're trying to promote a focus on wellness so people can have the tools to care better for themselves.\" 10 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 10 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017Actions speak louder than words. That axiom may be most appropri- ate to describe longtime Upstate faculty member William J. Williams, MD. \"He was an incredibly thoughtful person who always did the right thing and inspired those around him to do the same,\" says Mary Arseneau, his long time administrative assistant. In medicine, where ego can often get in the way, Dr. Williams stood out for his humility and kindness, leading by example rather than bravado. \"Dr. Williams had a gift when it came to teaching,\" says David Heisig, MD, an internal medicine resident from 1983 to 1986 and a gastroenter- ology fellow from 1989 to 1991. \"You knew what he expected, and appro- priately, it was a lot. He would show you the way and lead by example. He never shamed you; any disappoint- ment came from within because you desired to meet his standards,\" says Dr. Heisig. Known for his gentlemanly demeanor and signature bow tie, Williams was a world-class physician who literally wrote the book in his field, Williams' Hematology, now in its ninth edition. Williams, who died in November 2016 at age 89, said he was inspired to go into medicine by both his home-town doctor and the Sinclair Lewis novel, Arrowsmith, whose protagonist, an academic medical researcher, was all the things he wanted to be. In 1945, Williams entered medical school at the University of Pennsylva-nia when he was only 18, enrolling in a special program aimed at producing doctors to fulfill the needs of the military. As an apprentice seaman in the Navy, he was assigned to a hematology lab at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Philadelphia, where he was able to see the close association between the laboratory and clinical problems. Although the war was over by the time he graduated and com- pleted his internship, he stayed in the Naval reserve. Williams earned his medical degree from the University of Penn- sylvania School of Medicine in 1949, where he remained until 1969, serv- ing as chief of the Hematology Section and professor of medicine. During that time he also spent 18 months at Wash- ington University of Saint Louis, and a year at Oxford University, collaborat- ing on research projects. Williams' research centered on the biochemical mechanisms of blood coagulation, specifically the initiation of blood clotting by Russell's viper venom and tissue factor. He also par-ticipated in projects on methylma-lonic acid excretion in vitamin B12 deficiency, carbon monoxide produc- tion as a measure of hemolysis, and phospholipid metabolism in plate-lets and leukocytes. Later he studied peripheral blood stem cells and spent a sabbatical working at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. In 1967-68, Williams served as interim chair of internal medicine at Penn; Gregory Eastwood, MD, was a second-year resident. \"Part of the duties of a second-year resident was to report on new admissions to the dean every morning,\" Dr. Eastwood recalls. \"I was certainly in awe of Dr. Williams and his emerging national prominence in the field of hematology.\" Williams left Penn to join SUNY Upstate in 1969 as the Edward C. Rei- fenstein Professor of Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Medi-cine, where he served for 22 years. He was tapped to serve as interim dean of the College of Medicine from 1991-92. The following year, Eastwood joined Upstate Medical University as pres- ident and Williams coordinated the inauguration. \"We developed a close relation- ship, both personally with our wives, and professionally. He was one of the The Gentleman Doctor Dr. William J. Williams' scientific accomplishments shaped the practice of medicine. So did his teaching. UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 11 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 11 very few people on campus I could ask advice from and know he didn't have an agenda,\" says Eastwood. \"That's really valuable when you're running an organization like this.\" Eastwood chose Williams to serve as dean from 2002-04, during a search for a permanent replacement. \"I didn't think it was right to call him interim dean since he'd already served as interim,\" says Eastwood. Williams, who had been named a SUNY Distinguished Service Profes- sor, was named dean emeritus upon completion of his term. Despite his many accomplish- ments, he's most prominently known for the book. Williams began work-ing on Hematology in the mid-1960s, in collaboration with Ernest Beutler, MD, Allan Erslev, MD, and Wayne Run-dles, MD, who was replaced by Mar- shall Lichtman, MD, after the second edition. Williams continued as editor- in-chief through the fourth edition, when the name was changed to Wil - liams Hematology. \"Bill was a superb academic phy- sician. He was a fastidious person with experience in medical research and I am sure he set high standards for clin- ical care and clinical research as the leader of the institution,\" says his co-editor Marshall Lichtman, MD, Professor Emeritus of Medicine and of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of Rochester Medical Center. \"He was devoted to medical student, resident, and fellowship education and the students and facu- lty at Upstate derived great benefit from his devoted leadership. Inevitably, his lead- ership, standards, and expectations would have impact on the quality of care received at Upstate, the ultimate benefit to the area.\" Williams Hema- tology \"guided gen- erations of clinicians, biomedical researchers and in many disciplines through the origins, pathophysiological mecha- nisms and management of benign and malignant disorders of blood cells and coagulation proteins,\" says publisher McGraw-Hill. But at Upstate, it was as a teacher that Williams impacted generations of students and trainees. \"Bill had no qualms about stu- dents listening to his heart and lungs and palpating his liver edge during physical diagnosis courses,\" says Heisig. \"He always had time for questions from students and resi- dents. He was there if you were anx- ious, depressed, or simply uncertain and just needed an empathic ear or his wealth of experience.\" While it was obvious Williams loved teaching and had a gift for it, \"his love for students transcended the workplace,\" says Stephen Knohl, MD, an internal medicine resi- dent at Upstate from 1997 to 2000, chief resident in 2000-01, nephrol-ogy fellow from 2001-03, and now professor of medicine and residency program director at Upstate. \"He rou-tinely invited learners of all levels to his home simply to thank them for their efforts and to showcase the life and culture that existed outside of our profession. I was fortunate to attend events at his home numerous times and he and his wife, Karen, were always so gracious.\" Victor Y . Yazbeck, MD, an inter- nal medicine resident from 2007 to 2010, and now a hematologist at Vir- ginia Commonwealth University, says \"Williams brought a humanistic touch to a competitive field. He knew each trainee well and would occasionally surprise them with a T -shirt, a book, or a personal gift,\" Dr. Yazbeck recalls. Williams \"officially\" retired in 2006, but continued teaching at Upstate until a couple of years ago, particularly with Learning to T .A.L.K., a program Knohl developed that teaches medical residents to be better communicators. \"I am certain that this program would not have become the success it has without his time, his honest feedback, and his worthwhile counsel,\" Knohl says. He leaves a great legacy. While many residents were attracted to Upstate because of his textbook (with more than a few joining the faculty because of his outstanding leadership and support), Yazbeck says they remember him best for his \"big heart and his penchant for looking after them.\" \"He always talked lovingly of his own large brood of children,\" recalls Heisig. \"You realized he also talked that way about the myriad students and residents he taught before, and as Bill's pupil, you were also one of that brood. It was a special honor.\" Knohl says that, if you're lucky, you encounter people in life who inspire you to aspire in a way you couldn't otherwise imagine. \"Dr. Williams was absolutely one of those people in my life and I will forever be thankful,\" he says. nThe Gentleman Doctor 12 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 Andrew W . Gurman, MD '80 Protecting the Profession From gun violence and insurance monopolies to contentious debate over immigration and health care policy, it has been a rollercoaster year for Andrew W . Gurman, MD '80, as Ameri- can Medical Association (AMA) president. \"For our colleagues out there who had not yet realized the importance of advo-cacy, well, I hope 2017 has been their wake-up call,\" said Dr. Gurman during opening remarks at the 2017 AMA annual meeting in June. At the same time Gurman was gal- vanizing physicians from across the nation convened in Chicago, the U.S. Senate was deliberating health care leg- islation that threatens the coverage of millions of Amer-icans. The American Health Care Act, which the House passed in May despite opposition from the AMA and patient advocacy groups would slash Medicaid, raise rates, increase deductibles, cut subsidies and weaken patient protections. The fear is that many would be priced out of the market or lose coverage altogether. \"Each of us has a crucial role to play in creating a health care system that better delivers for our patients,\" Gurman told his audience. \"A system that is accessible and affordable. One that is flexible around their needs. One that is transparent about cost and exists as part of a larger social safety net to keep us living longer, healthier and more active lives . . . \" he said. \"They need all of us speak-ing out on their behalf.\" Gurman is no stranger to advocacy, having first joined the AMA as an Upstate Medical University student and becoming student delegate to the AMA Student Busi- ness Session (precursor to the AMA Medical Student Sec- tion). During his 30-plus-year career as a hand surgeon in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Gurman served as president of the Blair County Medical Society, vice speaker and then speaker of the Pennsylvania Medical Society House of Del-egates, and as a two-time chair of the Pennsylvania Med- ical Society's Political Action Committee. He spent eight years as vice speaker and then speaker of the AMA House of Delegates\u2014the AMA's major policy-making body\u2014 before his election as president-elect in 2015. In June he completed his term as president and tran- sitioned to his role as immediate past president and board member. The triumvirate of president-elect, president, and immediate past-president lead the AMA as a team, \"so I'm not a has-been until next year,\" Gurman says. Arguably, it may be one of the most important junc- tures in history for organized medicine as America re-examines its entire healthcare system, and in the process, its underlying values. \"We're dealing with some very fundamental questions,\" says Gurman. \"Is healthcare a right or a privilege? And what is the role of government in healthcare? I think physicians need to be very much involved in that discussion.\"A CALL TO Some of the nation's top physician advocates started out at Upstate. Action BY REN\u00c9E GEARHART LEVY UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 13 We caught up with Gurman in May, less than a week after the House voted to pass the AHCA. He was in New York to discuss healthcare reform on CNN and MSNBC, but was bumped from the news cycle due to James Comey's firing as FBI director. \"The AMA was strongly opposed to the AHCA,\" Gurman told us, referring to a letter sent to Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi in March. \"AHCA removed over $800 billion from Medicaid over 10 years. The nonpartisan Congressional budget office estimates that 14 million people would lose insurance the first year and 24 million would lose it by 2026. We know that people who don't have health insurance live sicker and die younger. Quite simply, that's a bridge too far.\" The AMA articulated a set of principles on healthcare reform prior to the ACA and Gurman says they will remain the organization's principles after the current round of debate is done.\"We believe that access to health care is a right, just like K-12 education is a right, and that government has a role in helping to ensure that,\" he says. That said, \"The AMA is opposed to a single payer system. We believe there should be choice in lots of different ways, including physicians having a choice in the way in which we practice, but that is a discussion that will likely continue,\" he says. \"Right now, we need to make sure that everyone has access to insurance that is meaningful and useful, that patients have choice, and that there is an absolute commitment to quality.\" Gurman is particularly concerned about the lack of provision for funding cost-sharing reductions that reduce the cost of deductibles and co-pays for low-income indi- viduals. The AHCA limits the amount that people can get and makes the subsidies directly related to age rather than inversely related to income. \"If I'm a low-income person and have a plan with a $5,000 deductible, I basically don't have insurance,\" he says. \"I have catastrophic insur-ance that's meaningless because if I'm that poor, the first $5,000 is going to bankrupt me. That's a protection for the hospital and maybe the physician, but not for the patient.\" It's an issue he brings to the table as a working physi- cian, based on what he hears from his patients. \"The big-gest concern that my patients have right now is their large \"Right now, we need to make sure that everyone has access to insurance that is meaningful and useful, that patients have choice, and that there is an absolute commitment to quality.\" \u2014ANDREW W. GURMAN, MD '8014 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017deductible,\" he says. \"They're worried that they are one significant illness away from bankruptcy.\" While Gurman says his practice has essentially been \"an expensive hobby\" during the past year, maintaining that practice is tremendously important because it keeps him on the front lines of issues facing doctors and patients and gives him authenticity when talking with legislators or other physicians. \"I'm a practicing doc,\" he says. \"When someone gets up at a meeting and starts complaining about something, I can look him or her in the eye and say 'I received the same letter,' or 'I have the same problem.'\" That's what spurred Gurman's involvement in orga- nized medicine in a serious way. Early in his career, the state of Pennsylvania was facing a medical liability crisis. \"I was looking at a six-figure insurance premium. Some- thing had to be done or I was going to have to leave Penn-sylvania. A lot of other physicians were in the same situation and it was difficult to recruit new physicians to the state to practice.\" As chair of the political action committee for the Penn- sylvania Medical Society, Gurman set out to tackle the problem, spearheading the organization's involvement in political and judicial races that resulted in policy change. \"That pulled me in, in a big way,\" he says. Part of the appeal was enlarging his lens on medicine. \"I do wrist and hand surgery, so I live in a world that's 10-inches long,\" he says. \"Yet through organized medicine and all the problems we face, I get to work on some fascinating and important issues.\" So while the nation's healthcare problems are challenging, he doesn't believe they're insurmount-able. The Affordable Care Act wasn't perfect, Gurman says, but it expanded coverage to more than 20 million people. Instead of stripping health coverage from millions of patients through a repeal, he says Congress should focus on improving the ACA and take steps to stabilize the insur- ance marketplace. \"We need to stay rooted in principles, not politics,\" he says. Healthcare reform may be at the top of the national agenda, but it's not the only issue Gurman and the AMA have focused on in the last year. Other focus areas include gun violence, which the AMA called a public health issue, lobbying to support gun safety policies, including wait periods and background checks on all fire-arm purchases. He led the AMA in issuing a statement against Presi- dent Donald Trump's travel ban, emphasizing a need for diversity in medicine, including diversity in experience, practice setting, and opinion. Gurman has been outspoken on the need for transpar- ency in medicine, in everything from hospital pricing and physician reimbursement to pharmaceutical pricing. \"As a physician, I can write a prescription for you, but I have no idea what it truly costs,\" he says. UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 15 He'd like to eliminate burdensome administrative duties that drive up costs. \"Doctors spend two hours doing administrative stuff for every hour they spend doing patient care, which adds cost to the system,\" says Gurman. He's also concerned about physician burnout, which affects as much as half of the profession, and physician shortages that will only get worse given the cap on grad-uate medical education spots that has not increased since 1976. \"Congress needs to address it but they don't want to fund it,\" says Gurman. \"It's always money.\" In other words, there's no shortage of issues to tackle. While Gurman well understands the stresses and time constraints physicians face, he urges his peers to get involved in organized medicine. \"The discussions that go on in the halls of the legislature are important and impactful on our professional lives and the lives of our patients,\" he says. Gurman's own motivation stems from his desire to protect the profession. \"I know it sounds corny, but I really am in love with this profession and being a doctor,\" he says. \"One of the most intimate things a person can do is come to you and say, 'take care of me.' And it's incredi- bly gratifying to fix them,\" he says. \"We have to be custodians of the profession and advocate on behalf of the profession. We are the best ones who can tell the stories that need to be told.\" For more information, or to get involved, visit https://www.patientsbeforepolitics.org.Ted M. Mazer, MD '83 Taking it to the Courts Ted M. Mazer, MD '83, finished his medical train-ing with the strong belief that physicians were obli- gated to serve their communities, which meant accepting Medicaid patients. For the longest time, the San Diego otolaryngolo- gist had an \"open-door\" policy to patients, regardless of insurance. But as California's stagnant Medicaid (MediCal) re imbursement rates fell further below cost of rendering care, and colleagues stopped accepting MediCal patients, Dr. Mazer realized his \"paying\" cus- tomers were being crowded out by the glut of Medicaid patients who traveled over an hour to see him because they had no other access to ENT care. \"Anyone can tolerate a percent- age of their practice being underpaid, but when all of the offices were clos- ing their doors to Medicaid patients, and I was essentially the only one left, I had to make some hard decisions,\" he recalls. Mazer continued treat ing his existing fee-for-service patients and joined a rapidly growing MediCal managed care business in California, through which he negotiated better rates and less hassle. He also decided to fight back, a battle that continues to this day. Mazer is president-elect of the California Medical Association (CMA), an organization he has been heavily \"Nothing we do today in medicine, with our patients or for our patients, is not influ- enced by government, legislation, regulation, and the economics that we live in. If we don't advocate for ourselves as physicians and the profession, we won't be there to advocate for our patients.\" \u2014TED M. MAZER, MD '83 TED GRUDZINSKI16 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017involved in since soon after starting practice. \"Organized medicine is the primary advocate for physicians to main- tain the plurality of styles and practice, and to protect the physician from being forced to do things under economics and corporate direction that are not in the best interest of the patient,\" he says. In 2011, the CMA joined others in a suit against the State of California Department of Healthcare Services over a 10-percent reimbursement cut to MediCal providers, with Mazer as an intervener. According to Mazer, federal law requires that MediCal patients have the same access to physicians and other health care providers as the general insured public. \"Even before this cut, California was in violation of federal access law,\" he says. That case, in which Mazer was the last individual phy- sician intervener, was eventually heard by the Supreme Court in 2015, and remanded back to the 9th Circuit Court, where it has yet to be settled. He was also part of a coalition of California doctors who worked for more than a decade to fix Medicare rules that left some California physicians, especially in San Diego County, getting paid as though practicing in rural farmlands, far less than others in similar urban areas with similar costs of living and health services. \"I chaired the Committee on Medical Services for six years, so that's how I wound up with this expertise,\" says Mazer, whose leadership in organized medicine began as vice chair of the medical student section of the Medical Society of the State of New York while an Upstate medical student. Mazer also hopes to tackle abuse of Worker's Comp- ensation patients and physicians by Worker's Compensa-tion carriers. \"The carriers are interfering with timely care for patients and are abusing contracts with phy- sicians,\" he says. As a result, \"More and more physi-cians are walking away from the Worker's Comp program, which makes the spiral worse because people can't get access to timely care.\" Mazer says his involvement in organized medicine is, in part, self-motivated. \"Nothing we do today in med-icine, with our patients or for our patients, is not influ-enced by government, legislation, regulation, and the economics that we live in,\" he says. \"If we don't advocate for ourselves as physicians and the profession, we won't be there to advocate for our patients.\" He notes with pleasure that Upstate has begun a course in advocacy for medical students and hopes stu- dents will involve themselves throughout their careers in advocacy issues, either actively or by supporting those who take the time to do so. \"Physicians,\" he says, \"have responsibilities to their patients, their families, and their profession.\"Thomas J. Madejski, MD '86 On the Front Lines Insurance reform isn't the only hot-button issue con-fronted by organized medicine. According to figures from the National Institutes of Health, more than two million Americans are addicted to opioid painkillers. After unintentionally contributing to this epidemic by prescribing these highly addictive medications, physicians have had to recalibrate. It's an issue Thomas J. Madejski, MD '86, has been working on for the last half decade in his role as a delegate representing New York to the American Medical Associ-ation, as a member of the AMA Council on Medical Ser- vice, and as a committee member and officer of the Medical Society of the State of New York (MSSNY). \"We developed a very robust policy over the last five or six years that has reduced the number of opioids prescribed, which is a good thing. The AMA has put together a really good opioid task force that gives recommendations regarding best practices for prescribing, trying to do things to limit illicit access to narcotics, and trying to help patients who do have sub- stance issues,\" he says. Dr. Madejski, now president-elect of the MSSNY , is an internist with board certification in geriatrics and palliative care. He has a private practice in internal med- icine in Medina, New York, is president of the medical UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 17 staff at Medina Memorial Hospital, serves as medical director of two nursing homes and, for the last 25 years, as hospice director for Orleans County. \"Palliative care and pain issues go hand in hand,\" he says. In an effort to combat physicians who over-prescribe and patients from seeking excessive prescriptions, New York enacted the Internet System for Tracking Over-Prescribing Act, better known as I-STOP , in 2013, becoming the first state in the nation to mandate that physicians consult a database of a patient's prescription history before prescribing a schedule II, III, or IV controlled substance. Madejski says that while, in general, it's a good thing that opioid prescribing has decreased, there have been some unexpected consequences. In Western New York, six physicians in Erie and Niag- ara counties were criminally prosecuted for illegally pre-scribing opioid-based painkillers and public officials have spoken out about the need to hold physicians accountable for their contributing role in opiate drug-related deaths.Those comments have made doctors who prescribe opioid painkill-ers worried they could be prosecuted for simply doing their jobs. \"We certainly have no problem with physi-cians being prosecuted if they have committed a true crime,\" says Madejski, \"but to crim-inalize physicians in the practice of medicine is really a step in the wrong direction.\" Madejski, the son of two pharmacists, earned an undergraduate degree in pharmacy studies and worked part-time as a pharmacist himself during medical school at Upstate. He says that restrictions in opioid pre-scribing and a shortage of treatment centers for those addicted have led to a rise in the use of illicit narcotics, chiefly heroin and Fentanyl, which has caused an increase in overdose- related deaths. \"We've had ongoing discussions at the state level about how best to manage that and have advo- cated for policies we think would be supportive to patients and physicians.\" Madejski says he became increasingly active in orga- nized medicine during his career to combat issues he faced in his own practice, such as managed care, prior authori- zation of services, and denial of needed care for patients, \"things that interfere with patients' ability to get care, their ability to see you, or your ability to get paid for ser- vices,\" he says. \"Physicians have the most knowledge about the actual details of healthcare in terms of what is done for and to patients,\" says Madejski. \"We actually listen to patients on a daily basis. So we are a natural advocate to share their issues and concerns, not just with their health, but also with the healthcare system. That's part of the relationship and the trust between doctor and patient.\" n \"We actually listen to patients on a daily basis.

MADEJSKI, MD '8618 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 Beyond Politics A UNIQUE ELECTIVE PROVIDES A LENS INTO CHILDREN'S LIVES AT THE BORDER. Shocking. There was no other way to describe it. When Kethia Eliezer, MD '17 and Katie Howe, MD '17, arrived in Brownsville, Texas, as fourth- year medical students, they could barely believe they were still in the United States. \"The conditions were like a third-world country,\" says Dr. Eliezer, who was born in Haiti but grew up in New York. She's describing the \"Colonias,\" a Spanish word for suburb, which she and Howe say are actually slums with unreg- ulated plumbing and electricity and little access to education and health care. The Upstate medical students spent February in Brownsville doing an away elective serving children housed in immi- gration shelters in border towns along Texas's Lower Rio Grande Valley. When they'd signed up the previous July, they'd been attracted by the opportunity to train in an impoverished and medically under-served area in a unique geographic region. But when new President Donald Trump issued his first \"travel ban\" a week before they left\u2014putting a spot- light on immigration policies in the U.S. and broadening the autonomy of border patrol agents\u2014the stakes became a whole lot higher. \"It was arguably the most important time in history to be doing what we were doing,\" says Dr. Howe. \"People there were pretty on edge.\" Brownsville is the number one entry point from Mexico to the U.S. along the border from San Diego through Texas. Until the 1980s, when borders were rela- tively open, Mexicans came through the border at Brownsville and simply stayed. Today, 90 percent of the population is Hispanic. \"All the signs are Spanish. Everyone speaks Spanish. We stood out wherever we went,\" says Eliezer. The elective, Community for Children\u2014At the Border and Beyond, is essentially an advocacy course in com-munity pediatrics created by a pediatri- cian at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley School of Medicine. Eliezer and Howe were part of a cohort that included three other medical students and two pediatric residents from a variety of institutions. They lived in a dormitory on the medical school campus only 100 yards from the border and worked at children's shelters. These immigration shelters\u2014there are four in Brownsville\u2014house unaccom-panied children who cross the border from Mexico, most from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Since 2014, Central American migrants traveling undocumented to the U.S. dras-tically outnumber those from Mexico and outpace any other region in the world, largely fleeing gang violence, poverty, natural disaster, and political instability. While adults who are not immediately deported are kept at detention centers, under law, anyone under 18 must be moved to a shelter within 48 hours. Once placed at a shelter, the children and ado-lescents attend school and participate in various age-appropriate programming. Eliezer and Howe, who worked at two separate shelters that housed girls age 10 to 17, provided health education on topics such as hygiene, nutrition, safe-sex prac-tices, and seatbelt and helmet safety. \"The knowledge deficits were astounding,\" says Howe, who worked with teenage girls. \"A lot of them had no idea what a period was. They didn't know about HIV. We were talking about babies, and one girl asked me about the stork.\" In Latin American culture, certain things are not discussed in public, she says. And most of the girls came from traditional, conservative Roman Catholic backgrounds. \"This was the first formal health education most of them were receiving,\" she says. \"These kids are going to be joining children in schools in the United States, so part of it is to help them adapt to the norms of this country and assimilate,\" adds Eliezer. Although the medical students were never alone with the sheltered girls, they heard horrific stories about conditions the girls were fleeing and of their journeys traveling through Mexico to the U.S., some on foot, others riding atop freight trains, others transported by \"coyotes.\" \"During their travels, family members were raped or killed. Sometimes they STUDENT ROUNDS UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 19 were separated by the coyotes or got lost from each other. I met twin girls that came all by themselves,\" relates Eliezer. \"And then at the border, families are separated because kids are not allowed to stay at the detention centers with their parents. \"The thing that struck all of us is that these are just kids,\" she says. \"They'd be talking casually and some horrible detail would slip out. There's no innocence left.\" Unsurprisingly, many of the minors at the shelters suffered from mental health issues. \"A lot of these kids are on anti- depressants and antipsychotic medica- tions,\" says Howe. \"One day in the caf-eteria we witnessed a child having either a PTSD flashback or a frontal lobe seizure. These kids have been through a lot and their experiences manifest in psychomo-tor ways.\" The goal of the shelters is to reunify the minors with relatives or another sponsor in the United States. If the child has no relatives in the country and another sponsor isn't found within a pre-scribed period, they will be deported as they are considered criminals. \"We went to immigration court and saw a 10-year-old girl being tried for being a criminal against the Untied States because she entered illegally,\" says Howe. \"Yes, there's a political aspect to this, but there's also a social aspect. We need to change the lens through which we view this.\" In addition to court and their hands- on work at the shelters, Eliezer and Howe attended lectures, and visited the border wall and a cemetery for uniden- tified undocumented immigrants who died during their journey. They say they also learned a lot just from living in Brownsville for a month. \"Healthcare in Texas is different than healthcare in New York state,\" says Eliezer. \"That was a big surprise to me. There are healthcare disparities here, but in Texas, there was a larger gap.\" Despite high poverty rates in the Rio Grande Valley, Eliezer says health care delivery is completely private. \"The clos- est public hospital is three hours away.\" Eliezer and Howe both graduated from the College of Medicine in May and began residencies on July 1. Eliezer is now a pediatric resident at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, where she fully anticipates the possibility of treating kids who have spent time in immigra-tion shelters. Howe is a surgical resident at Morehouse Medical Center in Atlanta. Both were profoundly impacted by their experiences in Brownsville. Despite all the political rhetoric sur- rounding immigration, \"people are very detached to what's actually happening at the borders,\" says Eliezer. \"If a family or individual asks for asylum, they're sup-posed to be guaranteed an interview, but the border patrol has been given the dis- cretion to turn people away. I don't think it's ethical or humanistic.\" \"People aren't coming here to steal our jobs, they come because if they stay, they will either die of poverty and its complications or be murdered,\" says Howe. \"As the saying goes, you don't throw your child on a raft unless the water is safer than the land.\" n\". . . they come because if they stay, they will either die of poverty and its complications or be murdered.

Slezak '53 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 21 CLASS NOTES Not many surgeons have the opportunity to visit with patients 50 years post surgery, but that was the case for David B. Levine, MD '57, at the investi- ture celebration held in May for the chair in scoliosis in his name at New York City's Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS). The former scoliosis patients in attendance included a man with Marfan syndrome Dr. Levine operated on in 1971 when he was two years old; a patient with 110-degree scoliosis Levine cor- rected in 1967 with a Harrington rod (the first surgery of its type at HSS); and another patient who had five tracheostomies before seeing Levine because of breathing impairments from post-polio syn- drome. \"They're all in their fifties or sixties and doing well,\" he says. Levine is the former chief of the scoliosis service at HSS, the orthopedic department of Weill Cornell Medical Center that is con-sistently ranked the nation's top orthopedics hospital, and served on the surgical faculty for 30 years. He is also the proposer and a founder of the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS), an international society of more than 2,000 mem- bers, which he served as secretary- treasurer, secretary, president, and served on the board of directors for more than 10 years. Levine did his orthopedic train- ing at HSS, and near the end of his residency, was asked to complete a spine fellowship in California to learn techniques specific to treat-ing scoliosis in post-polio patients and bring them back to HSS. \"The standard treatment method at that time involved a big, heavy cast from the neck down to the knees,\" he explains. \"Post-polio patients, and others with respiratory prob-lems, couldn't tolerate that.\" These were demanding, physi- cal surgeries. \"We often operated through the chest, pushing the lung and heart away, and opened the spine from the front. We did that in two stages of about six- hours each,\" Levine says. During the course of his career, treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis advanced from a year of in and out of hospital confinement in large body casts to a hospital stay of four or five days, and even- tually, no cast at all. But by 1995, when advances in anesthesia allowed for a single 13-hour surgery, Levine retired from surgical practice as professor emeritus to explore other interests. First, he and his wife Janet (whom he met on a blind date as a second-year medical stu-dent when she was a freshman at Syracuse University) sold their home and moved to Florence, Italy, for six months, where Levine apprenticed with two local antiques restorers and took pri-vate cooking lessons, long-held interests he hadn't had time for during a busy surgical career. Upon their return, they rented an apartment in New York City and bought a 40-acre farm, upstate in Ancram, which they maintained until 2011. They rescued farm ani- mals, boarded black angus cows in exchange for upkeep of the prop-erty, and had plenty of room for a woodworking shop for Levine and an art studio for his wife.In 2003, Levine was drawn back to HSS when the hospital's new surgeon-in-chief asked him to head the alumni associa-tion. It was a chal- lenge he took on with gusto, in the process discovering a new passion for medical history. At HSS, he established and organized an archive, which includes original patient records dat- ing back to 1863, handwritten in calligraphy. Levine works with a part-time archivist to plan exhibits, the most recent on the history of anesthesia at the hospital back to 1890. Levine has written and pub- lished on medicine of the civil war, the history of cancer vaccines, and in conjunction with its 150th anni- versary, wrote a book detailing the history of the hospital, Anatomy of a Hospital: Hospital for Special Surgery, 1863-2013. At 85, Levine remains head of the HSS alumni affairs committee, director of the alumni association, and active researching and writing as a medical historian, continuing a lifelong pat- tern of juggling multiple pursuits. A Binghamton native, Levine attended Dartmouth College. While he had a scholarship his first year, he turned down subsequent loan offers, instead supporting his way through school by working as an usher at a local theater seven nights a week, doing carpentry on weekends, and working as a mail-man over Christmas vacation. He applied to Upstate Medical University on the suggestion of a friend because the application fee was only $2. While a medical stu- dent he worked every other night at the University Hospital blood bank and on weekends as an extern at Crouse Irving Hospital, on call for seven doctors if they needed assistance. \"They were all different specialists,\" he says. \"The orthope-dist seemed the happiest so that's why I went into it. It worked out just fine.\" \u2014Ren\u00e9e Gearhart LevyDAVID B. LEVINE, MD '57 Scoliosis Pioneer CLASS NOTES David B.

Experts say the stress, anxiety, and depression doctors face begins in medical school. \"There's something that happens during the training,\" says psychia- trist Anju Hurria, MD '07. \"People enter medical school with a mental health profile similar to other col- lege graduates. But by the time they graduate, 40 to 50 percent have suffered from anxiety and depression.\" It's a problem Dr. Hurria is hop- ing to treat at the root. As director of wellness at the UC Irvine School of Medicine, she helped create a comprehensive program to support the mental welfare of medical stu- dents, residents, and fellows. \"We've tried to create a 'well culture' that begins at medical school orientation and continues through our graduate medical edu- cation programs,\" she says. Hurria likens medical training to the military. \"The sleep disrup-tions, the high level of stress, see- ing traumatic events and not hav-ing the opportunity to process it\u2014 the training in medical school does parallel the military because you're just constantly in very stressful per- formance situations.\" Her approach in creating programming has been to be upfront about those issues from the start and create opportunities for student and faculty bonding. \"Research shows that having a con- nection with a faculty member or a mentor can be very sustaining dur- ing medical school,\" says Hurria. Medical students participate in an annual three-day retreat, held with faculty members at a nearby campground. A mentorship pro-gram pairs students in the upper two years of medical school with those in the first two years, and Hurria runs what she calls \"process groups\" four times a year, where students come together to confi-dentially share experiences. \"I'm there to facilitate but the groups really lead themselves,\" she says. \"Students share things they are struggling with and help each other through it. Processing experiences rather than just stuffing them down is very therapeutic. We're no longer encouraging people to just 'push their way through it.'\" Hurria says it's common for people to feel they are the only one who is struggling or feeling anxious, which leads to isolation. \"We've really tried to shift that by being open about it and create an environment where we have each other's back,\" she says. \"It's been a huge culture shift. You can feel it among the students\u2014they feel it's their responsibility to look out for each other.\" A native Californian, Hurria began her own medical stud-ies at Upstate with an interest in geriatrics and palliative care. She began her psychiatry residency at UC San Diego with those same interests, but a rotation in child psychiatry turned her in the oppo-site direction. \"There are similarities between gero and child psychiatry because you work a lot with fami-lies,\" she says. \"I just really loved the child units.\"After completing a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry, Hurria stayed on as an assistant clinical professor for one year before transferring to the Irvine campus, where she is an assistant clinical professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior. Hurria's new position initially included a half-day a week devoted to counseling medical students who needed support. Over time, her efforts expanded to creating a wellness program for the medical school and then for graduate medi- cal education. \"There was a lot of trial and error to see what works and what doesn't,\" says Hurria, who now acts as a consultant to other UC campuses on their well- ness initiatives. This spring, Hurria was named a Physician of Excellence by the Orange County Medical Association and received the UC Irvine Faculty Humanism Award, an honor selected by students. She currently spends half her time supervis-ing a child psychiatry medication management and therapy clinic, where she focuses on abuse and autism, and the other half devoted to medical school/GME wellness initiatives. \"I never had any intention of going into wellness,\" says Hurria. But it's been incredibly gratifying to help other students and physicians have a healthy and fulfilling train- ing experience.\" \u2014Ren\u00e9e Gearhart LevyANJU HURRIA, MD '07 Promoting Wellness UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017 27 CLASS NOTES Anju Hurria, MD '07 28 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | AUTUMN 2017CLASS NOTES Brian Quigley, of Raleigh, NC, completed his third year as a team physician for the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes.

COMIS, MD '71, HS '75, a world- renowned oncologist and researcher, passed away suddenly at home while painting on May 10, at age 71. Co-chair of the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, Dr. Comis was a giant in cancer research known as a champion for patient access to clinical trials. His leadership is credited with changing clinical practice across multiple types of cancer through clinical trials designed and conducted by the Group. Most recently, Comis cemented the Group's capa- bilities in precision medicine by working closely with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to lead the design and implementation of the NCI-MATCH (EAY131) trial, the largest, most scientifically rigorous precision medi-cine cancer trial to date. Comis earned his undergraduate degree at Fordham University and his medical degree at Upstate, where he also completed his medical internship and residency. He served as a staff associate at the National Cancer Institute and completed a medical oncology fellowship at The Sidney Farber Cancer Center at Harvard Medical School. He held various clinical practice and research leadership positions at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Temple University School of Medicine, Fox Chase Cancer Center, and Allegheny Cancer Center. Comis was a diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine and a member of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine. Comis had been a member of boards and com- mittees for many prestigious academic organizations, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and C-Change, the American Radium Society, National Coalition for Cancer Research, and others. He served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Cancer Research, and Clinical Cancer Research; authored more than 140 scientific articles; and contributed to more than 20 scientific and medical textbooks on cancer.

ROHNER, MD '52, HS '56, beloved professor of pathology at Upstate for more than four decades, died on June 6 at age 89. A Syracuse native, Dr. Rohner earned his under - graduate degree from Syracuse University, graduated from Upstate Medical University, and completed an intern year at St. Joseph's Hospital before returning to Upstate for his pathology residency. After serving in the U.S. Navy for several years, he joined the Upstate faculty. Rohner once said he was attracted to path ology because the precision through the microscope was far more than could be found in clinical medicine back in the 1950's, and \"I am a Type A, Grade A, obsessive, nut,\" he said in an interview. Rohner influenced decades of Upstate graduates in his role teaching the second-year College of Medicine pathology course, providing the scientific foundation of the nature of disease, its causes, processes, develop-ment, and consequences. As attested by his former students, Rohner had an extraordinary gift for teaching as well as for personally connecting with students, many of which became close friends. He is well remembered for his creative methods and frequent use of acronyms, such as FART (failure, arrhythmia, rupture and thromboembolic phenomena) for the complications of myocardial infarction. \"If you are talking to a bunch of nuns you can make it spell RAFT, but nobody would remember that,\" Rohner said. Rohner \"retired\" from Upstate in 1983, but continued as a volunteer teacher well into the 1990s. During his tenure, students dedicated countless year - books to him, and presented him with the Phillip B. Armstrong Award\u2014given to the basic science teacher who most influenced their lives\u2014at least 18 consecu-tive years. He was asked to read the Oath at com-mencement almost as many times. In 1988, an endowed professorship in pathology was created in his name. And in 2007, a classroom in the Setnor Academic Building was named in his honor. Rohner was survived by his sister-in-law, Kathryn Candreva; several nieces and nephews; and many devoted friends.
