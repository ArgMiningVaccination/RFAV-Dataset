In Tasmania, you must legally provide your child's schools or childcare operator information about their vaccinations. Scheduled childhood vaccinations If your child is starting school or childcare, you must provide a written statement confirming that your child is up to date with all scheduled immunisations, including: [chicken pox (varicella)] - diphtheria - haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) - hepatitis B - influenza - measles - meningococcal infection - mumps - pertussis (whooping cough) - pneumococcal disease - polio - rotavirus - rubella (German measles) - tetanus [Learn about when your child should receive different vaccinations](/node/3406) [.] Your child must meet immunisation requirements if you get Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A or child care fee assistance. This includes being up-to-date with the childhood National Immunisation Program Schedule. [Find out more about immunisation requirements.](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/what-are-immunisation-requirements?context=41186) [View local council immunisation schedules for 2023](/node/16611) How to get your child's vaccination history There are several ways to get proof of your child's vaccination history. - Use their Personal Health Recor [d](if the person administering the vaccine clearly signed their name for each vaccine administered). - Ask your doctor or local council for signed information on their letterhead. It must list the diseases that your child has been immunised against and when. - Use the [Australian Childhood Immunisation Register](http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/public/services/acir/index.jsp)(ACIR) statement provided to you when your child turns five years of age. - Phone the ACIR on [1800 653 809](tel:1800653809)(if your child was immunised after January 1996). What are the side effects of immunisation? Some children experience minor side effects following immunisation. Common side effects of immunisation are: - redness, soreness and swelling at the injection site - mild fever - being grizzly or unsettled. Most side effects only last a short time and your child will recover without any problems. You can treat minor side effects by: - giving your child extra fluids to drink - not overdressing them if they are hot - using paracetamol to help ease the fever and soreness (speak to your local pharmacy or doctor). What can I do if my child has a serious side effect? - It is important to remember that vaccines are many times safer than the diseases they prevent. - Serious reactions to immunisation are very rare. - If they do occur, please consult your doctor immediately. Why should children be immunised? - Immunisation is the safest and most effective way of giving protection against the disease. - The benefit of protection against the disease far outweighs the very small risks of immunisation. - After immunisation, your child is far less likely to catch the disease if there are cases in the community. - If your child is immunised and gets the disease, they will not be as sick as if they are not vaccinated. - If enough people are immunised, infection can no longer be spread, and the disease dies out altogether. - If good immunisation rates aren't maintained, previously eliminated diseases like [polio]may return. Why do children get so many immunisations? - Babies have protection from many infectious diseases from antibodies transferred during pregnancy. - Immunisations are required to prevent serious infections when the antibodies wear off. - Young children's immune systems don't work as well as older children and adults. - Several immunisations are required in the first few years of your child's life. - New vaccines may be developed against serious infections. - Some vaccines are combined into one dose. Are there any reasons to delay immunisation? - There are very few medical reasons to delay immunisation. - If your child is sick with a high temperature (over 38.5\u00baC) then postpone immunisation until they are well. A child can still be vaccinated if they: - have a runny nose but are not ill - are on antibiotics to recover from an illness. Is homeopathic 'immunisation' recognised? No. Only conventional immunisation has been proven to provide enough protection against these diseases.
