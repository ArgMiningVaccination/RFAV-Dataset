Pennebaker2,3 1Georgia Institute of Research 3University of Texas at Austin tmitra3@gatech.edu counts@microsoft.com pennebaker@mail.utexas.edu Abstract The anti-vaccination movement threatens public health by reducing the likelihood of disease eradication. With social media's purported role in disseminating anti-vaccine infor- mation, it is imperative to understand the drivers of attitudes among participants involved in the vaccination debate on a communication channel critical to the movement: Twitter. Using four years of longitudinal data capturing vaccine dis- cussions on Twitter, we identify users who persistently hold pro and anti attitudes, and those who newly adopt anti atti- tudes towards vaccination. After gathering each user's entire Twitter timeline, totaling to over 3 million tweets, we ex- plore differences in the individual narratives across the user cohorts. We find that those with long-term anti-vaccination attitudes manifest conspiratorial thinking, mistrust in gov- ernment, and are resolute and in-group focused in language. New adoptees appear to be predisposed to form anti- vaccination attitudes via similar government distrust and general paranoia, but are more social and less certain than their long-term counterparts. We discuss how this apparent predisposition can interact with social media-fueled events to bring newcomers into the anti-vaccination movement. Given the strong base of conspiratorial thinking underlying anti-vaccination attitudes, we conclude by highlighting the need for alternatives to traditional methods of using authori- tative sources such as the government when correcting mis- leading vaccination claims. Introduction Measles, a highly contagious respiratory disease responsi- ble for an estimated 122,000 deaths worldwide each year, was officially eradicated fro m the United States in 2000. Yet the disease appears to be rebounding. According to the CDC, in 2014 the number of measles cases had reached a 20-year high1(CDC 2015). Sadly, many of these cases could have been prevented, as 90% of measles cases in 2014 were in people who were not vaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown. One reason for this re- bound is that concerns about vaccine side effects have tak- en precedence over the dangers of potentially deadly vac- cine-preventable diseases and a vaccination culture pro- moting anti-vaccination has emerged (Kata 2010).

All rights reserved. persistent vaccine criticism movement has spread rapidly through social media, a channel often used to disseminate medical information without verification by the expert medical co mmunity (Keelan et al. 2010). G i v e n t h e i n c r e a s i n g r e l i a n c e o n o n l i n e m e d i a f o r a c c u - rate health information and th e general growth of social media sites, the attitudes of anti-vaccination advocates risk becoming a global phenomenon th at could impact immun- ization behavior at significan t scale (Kata 2010). In fact a controlled study showed that p a r e n t s o p t i n g t o e x e m p t children from vaccination are more likely to have received the information online compared to those vaccinating their kids (Salmon et al. 2005). These parents benefit from \"herd immunity\" in which eradica tion is achieved by immunizing a critical proportion of the popul ation. However, as inter- net-fueled misbeliefs drive people to opt out of vaccina- tion, herd immunity is weaken ed, increasing the chances of a disease outbreak. Thus it is important to understand the underlying characteristics of i n d i v i d u a l s w i t h a n t i - vaccination attitudes. What dr ives people to develop and perpetuate the anti-vaccination movement? I n t h i s p a p e r w e e x p l o r e t h i s q u e s t i o n b y e x a m i n i n g i n - dividuals' overt expressions to wards vaccination in a social media platform extensively us ed for vaccine discussions: Twitter. By using four years of longitudinal data capturing vaccination discussions on Twitter, we identify three sets of key individuals: users who are persistently pro vaccine, those who are persistently anti vaccine and users who new- ly join the anti-vaccination cohort following an event sym- bolic to the vaccine controversy. Long-term anti- vaccination advocates play an important role in preventing eradication because they sustain weakness in herd immuni- ty, and thus it is crucial to understand them and their moti- vations. Examining new an ti-vaccination proponents al- lows us to understand the type of person that would adopt such a stance despite strong recommendations to the con- trary from authoritative organizations like the CDC. After fetching each cohort's entire tim eline of tweets, totaling to more than 3 million tweets, we compare and contrast their linguistic styles, topics of interest, social characteristics and underlying cognitive dimensions, all with an eye to Proceedings of the Tenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2016) 269uncovering the drivers of such extreme attitudes against a social good. W e f i n d t h a t p e o p l e h o l d i n g persistent anti-vaccination attitudes use more direct language and have higher expres- sions of anger compared to their pro counterparts. They also show general conspiracy thinking and mistrust in the government, suggesting characteristics of paranoia. Adopters of anti-vaccine attitudes show similar conspirato- rial ideation and suspicion toward government even before they start expressing anti-vacci ne attitudes. This suggests that the new adoptees are alrea dy predisposed to form anti- vaccine attitudes. Moreover, long-term anti-vaccine advo- cates exhibit higher sense of g r o u p s o l i d a r i t y . I n d i v i d u a l s in such close-knit groups typically end up adhering to their extreme positions, often fueling beliefs in false conspira- cies and are particularly resistant to correction (Sunstein and Vermeule 2009). These findings suggest that health officials attempting to simply c o r r e c t c o n s p i r a c y f u e l l e d false claims might be c ounterproductive. Thus newer methods to counter the harmful consequences of anti- vaccination beliefs are needed. B r o a d l y w e h o p e t h i s w o r k contributes to two bodies of research: computer mediat ed communication (CMC) re- search on contentious topics ( K a t a 2 0 1 0 ; K e e l a n e t a l . 2010; Salmon et al. 2005), and psychology research on maintaining and adopting an attitude (Kristiansen and Zanna 1988; Rokeach 1968; Savion 2012). With respect to CMC research, examining the naturally occurring self- expressions of these cohorts hi ghlight the linguistic style, social media characteristics, a nd topics of interest driving people with health behavior beliefs that are antithetical to the health of society as a whole. With regards to attitude psychology, while there are numerous lab-based studies listing various factors driving resistant attitudes, our study is one of the first to provide large-scale empirical evidence of factors behind resistant attitudes towards vaccination. Related Work We provide a brief overview of two broad areas of research relevant to our study: attitude measurement and text analyt- ic approaches to study user traits. Measuring Attitude The concept of attitude has l ong been central to social psy- chology research. However, the definition of attitude has changed over the years resulting in no single universally accepted definition (Schwarz 2007). For the purposes of this study, we use the evaluative definition of attitude from the seminal work of Eagly and Chaiken (1993) - \"attitude is expressed by evaluating a particular entity with some degree of favor or disfavor\". By examining the social me- dia posts from users we determine whether the expressed attitude towards vaccination is for or against it. D e s p i t e a g r o w i n g b o d y o f w o r k o n a t t i t u d e , a m a j o r concern in its study has been the problem of accurate measurement. Attitude studies based on questionnaires and self-reports are highly context dependent and results can vary with changes in question wording, format or order (Schuman and Presser 1981). Participants can also conform to the demands of the questionnaire by creating superficial expressions of attitude (Abelson 1988). Even newer meth- ods of implicit measures of attitude (Dovidio and Fazio 1992) have shown sensitivity towards context, raising questions about its effectiveness over self-reported measures. However, the rapid gr owth of text-based social media has opened new opportunities to study attitudes un- obtrusively, as they naturally u n f o l d i n l a r g e p o p u l a t i o n s and over long time periods. For example, population atti- tudes extracted from tweet se ntiments has been shown to correlate with traditional po lling data (O'Connor et al. 2010). Machine learning techniques on textual data have accurately predicted sentence level attitudes in online dis- cussions (Hassan, Qazvinian, and Radev 2010). Drawing on the success of studying attitudes from online textual data, we built a classifier to determine positive and nega- tive attitudes towards vaccination. Analyzing text to infer individual characteristics Attitudes and language are intimately related (Eiser 1975). For decades social scientists have demonstrated that indi- viduals often adopt language consistent with their attitudes (Eiser and Ross 1977). Hence a growing number of studies have used content-analytic approaches to assess individual differences and personality characteristics. A popular ap- proach is simply to count and categorize the words that people speak. A validated tool for such an approach is LIWC, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (Tausczik and Pennebaker 2010). Researchers have used LIWC for a number of psychological measurem ent tasks, such as deci- phering psychological states of presidential candidates from their spontaneous speech samples (Slatcher et al. 2007), identifying true and false stories by analyzing lin- guistic styles (Newman et a l. 2003), examining differences between depressed and non-depressed individuals (Rude, Pro vaccination Tweets An ti Vaccination Tweets Measles Outbreak in U.K. Linked to Poor MMR Vaccine Uptake After Autism Scare [link] Would rather have measles in my kid than lifetime seizures and autism, VIT A for a week, big deal #CDCwhistleblower #Vaccines are not a scientific controversy. They work. The vacci nes have increased autism, peanut allergies & childhood cancers . Table 1: Example tweets labeled as pro and anti-vaccination by three master Turkers. 270Gortner, and Pennebaker 2004), and contrasting pro- anorexic and pro-recovery people (De Choudhury 2015). A n o t h e r p o p u l a r t e x t a n a l y t i c t e c h n i q u e a m o n g s o c i a l psychologists is the Meaning Extraction Method (MEM) (Chung and Pennebaker 2008). MEM can reliably infer the dimensions along which people think about themselves or particular issues. Scientists have used MEM to capture psychological dimensions of se lf expressions in personal narratives (Chung and Pennebaker 2008), measure peo- ple's basic values underlying their attitude (Ryan L. Boyd et al. 2015) and capture dimensions of self-expressions in social media posts, such as Facebook status updates (Kramer and Chung 2011). Following in their footsteps, our work uses MEM to capture differences in the dimen- sions of thought across groups of individuals with differing attitudes towards vaccination. We complement this with LIWC's linguistic analysis to e x a m i n e d i f f e r e n c e s i n e x - pression styles. We return to the details of MEM later. Data Collection Our data collection involves two main phases. Figure 1 outlines the main steps. Phase1: Collecting Pro & Anti-Vaccination Tweets To fetch vaccine specific posts, we first did a manual ex- amination of 1000 Twitter posts and 50 news reports on vaccination to identify search terms and phrases relevant to the vaccination debate. Based on a snowball sampling ap- proach, we used the initial set of search terms to extract a tweet sample from the Twitter Firehose2 s t r e a m b e t w e e n January 1 and 5, 2012. Two researchers then manually inspected the sample to identify any co-occurring terms missed and to remove spurious terms that might be return- ing tweets too broad to classify on either side of the issue. The final set had 5 phrases: 'vaccination+autism', 'vac- cine+autism', 'mmr+vaccination', 'measles+autism' and fetched tweets 2 The Twitter Firehose stream is a dataset of all public posts from Twitter made available to us through an agreement with Twitter. spanning four calendar years - January 1, 2012 to June 30, 2015, totaling to 315,240 tweets generated by 144,817 unique users. Our next task w as to build a classifier to identify pro and anti stance of the collected vaccine tweets. Classify Vaccination St ance - Stance Classifier Our classifier was based on a tw o-step labeling process: (1) gathering human annotations on a sample, and (2) leverage the labeled data to annotate the remaining collection of tweets. For the human annota tion task, we randomly sam- pled a batch of 2000 posts from each year (a total of 8000 posts) and recruited 3 independent Amazon Mechanical Turk master workers residing in the United States to identi- fy whether the post content is for or against vaccination. Workers were presented with definitions of pro and anti vaccination content along with e x a m p l e t w e e t s t o t r a i n them in the labeling task. We retained posts where all three workers agreed on the post being either pro or anti. We show a sample in Table 1. B a s e d o n a q u a l i t a t i v e e x a m i n a t i o n o f t h e f r e q u e n t l y occurring unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and hashtags, we found that trigrams and hashtags were prominent cues of a tweet's stance towards vaccina tion. For example, phrases like vaccines causing encephalitis , already #vaccinein- jured like, #VaccineInducedAutism a r e i n d i c a t i v e o f t h e tweet being against vaccination, while shut-up #antivaxx- ers #science mmr signal pro-vaccination stance. Using trigrams and hashtags as features, we built a superv ised learning classifier by training a support vector m achine (SVM) under 10-fold cross validation. We refer to this as our \"stance classifier\". We retained only tweets for which the classifier predicted stance with high probability (greater than 0.9).The predic- tion accuracy of our classifier was 84.7%. The resulting dataset had 49,354 tweets, classified with attitude stance and posted by 32,282 unique users. In the next phase, we examine this user set to identify our user cohorts. Phase2: Identifying User Cohorts The goal of this phase is to segregate three principle actors - long term advocates of pro and anti vaccination attitude and users newly adopting anti-vaccination attitude. Our Figure 1: Steps to identify user cohorts.

To find users who newly joined the anti-vaccination cohort, we needed to fix on a time period before which users did not mention about vaccination but actively tweet- ed anti-vaccination posts after that time. We selected Au- gust 15, 2014 as our cutoff time. This time was marked by a symbolic event pertaining to the vaccine debate: A false claim reported that a CDC whistleblower exposed CDC data linking autism among African-American boys follow- ing MMR vaccination3. The event was widely tweeted un- der the #CDCwhistleblower hashtag and was a topic of active discussion among users interested in the vaccine debate. Collecting Historical Posts from Users Recall that 32,282 unique user s posted our filtered collec- tion of vaccination tweets. We collect their entire Twitter timeline tracing back from J une 30, 2015 (time when our data collection started). Using the same set of vaccine re- lated search terms as in phase 1, we search each user's Twitter timeline to find their history of vaccine posts. Next, we pass their vaccine s p e c i f i c t w e e t s t h r o u g h o u r stance classifier, retaining onl y those for which the classi- fier is able to determine pr o or anti stance with high proba- bility (>= 0.9). Finally we cl assify users as holding pro (anti) attitude if more than 70% of their vaccination tweets are classified as pro (anti). Users who were consistently classified as pro or anti across all four years are the long- term advocates. Hereafter we refer to them as active-pro and active-anti. U s e r s w h o w e r e c l a s s i f i e d a s h o l d i n g a n anti-vaccine attitude after August 15, 2014 are adoptees of the anti-vaccination attitude (the joining-anti cohort). We intentionally did not create a joining-pro c o h o r t . W h i l e interesting, our focus is on understanding the anti- vaccination users, for whom the active-pro cohort can pro- vide contrast as necessary. O u r c o h o r t s e l e c t i o n p r o c e s s t a k e s a v e r y c o n s e r v a t i v e approach, resulting in considerable shrinkage of our cohort pool. We purposely opt for this strategy to maintain high precision and to have high confidence that the users are indeed holding these extreme attitudes. Our final cohort comprises 373 active-pro , 70 active-anti, 223 joining-anti about 2.12M, 0.46M and 0.85M tweets respectively. Method What can we learn about people with pro or anti attitudes towards vaccination from their digital footprints left in Twitter? Recall that people's natural language expression can convey personalities and cognitive processes (Cohn, Mehl, and Pennebaker 2004). Hence we adopt a lexical approach to compare and cont rast our cohorts. Lexical ap- proaches have been widely used by psychologists to cap- ture personality traits (Allport and Odbert 1936), cognitive processes (Slobin 1996) and more recently to analyze open-ended self-descriptions (Chung and Pennebaker 2008). The basic premise of a lexical approach is that the important ways in which indi viduals differ are represented by words. Using lexical approaches we can understand how people talk while mentioning the vaccination issue and what t o p i c s t h e y t a l k a b o u t ? T o i n v e s t i g a t e t h e what aspect we inductively extract meaningful themes from us- ers' natural language expressions using the Meaning Ex- traction Method (Chung and Pennebaker 2008). To exam- ine the how aspect we use the LIWC program for compar- ing usage rates of function and content words in tweets from individuals. We complement our lexical quantifica- tions with social media specifi c features such as user's follower to following ratio and tweet volume. Meaning Extraction Method (MEM) MEM is a topic modeling approach to extract dimensions along which users express themselves. For example, an individual with 'vaccination' as a n i m p o r t a n t p a r t o f h e r cognitive self is likely to engage in thoughts related to vac- cination or even other related health topics (Cantor 1990; Markus 1977). These cognitive dimensions will naturally be reflected in the words that she uses in her everyday so- cial media posts. MEM uses a factor analytic approach to form clusters of co-occurring words (Chung and Penne- baker 2008). Specifically, it performs a principal compo- nent analysis on the matrix of words used by social media post authors to find how they naturally co-occur. These word co-occurrences identify linguistic dimensions that represent psychologically meani ngful themes. Contrary to other topic modeling approaches, the MEM extracted di- mensions can be examined at the level of an individual, allowing us to make meaningful inferences in the context of a user. Being a word-count based approach, MEM is highly interpretable. Further, MEM has been shown to capture psychological dimensi ons of self-expressions in personal narratives (Chung and Pennebaker 2008) and in social media posts (Kramer and Chung 2011). Figure 2: User cohort statistics 272Results Understanding Long-Term Advocates We want to identify the characteristics of individuals hold- ing persistent attitudes towards vaccination, our active-pro and active-anti user cohorts. What topics are relevant to them? To know what topics the two cohorts talk about, we passed their combined twit- ter feeds (2.58M in total) through the Mean Extraction helper software (Boyd 2015) which automates the MEM approach. We identified 8 factors that explain 63.4% of the variability in the user data (Table 2)4. Considering the gen- erative nature of language, 63.4% of variance is fairly high (Chung and Pennebaker 2008). Key factors included the factor labeled 'Evil Government', with terms like war, government, arrest, military, iran, terrorist . The 'Chronic Health' factor comprised terms referring to persistent health conditions and its associated risks and treatment. For the 'Autism vs. Affect' factor, words describing emo- tion loaded negatively, while words referring to autism loaded positively, suggesting that this factor is referring to autism in an objective sense, devoid of much emotion. An- other important factor that surfaced is 'Vaccine & Dis- ease', with words referring to disease outbreaks ( outbreak, measles, hepatitis, pandemic, hiv ) and vaccination ( vac- cine, immunization, trial ). It is worth noting that the emer- gence of this last factor helps validate the MEM approach, 4 Similar to other topic modeling methods, researchers have some degree of flexibility to determine the numbe r of themes. For MEM, theme inter- pretability is the main determining factor. as we would expect long-ter m advocates to be quite in- volved in discussions of v accines and diseases. Having derived the thematic factors, our next task is to examine the differences and similarities across these dimensions. Following between and within subjects experimental de- sign approach, we perform two sets of comparisons: be- tween groups and within time (see Table 3). T o s t a r t , w e c o m p a r e t h e t w o l o n g - t e r m a c t i v e u s e r c o - horts across the 8 factors (Table 3, Between Group). We find that the active-anti group uses more words referring to 'Evil Government', 'Organic F o o d ' a n d ' F a m i l y v s . N u - ance. Given the loadings of the specific words on the 'Family vs. Nuance' factor, the active-anti cohort appears to be relatively focused on the family aspects of vaccina- tion but in absolute terms, without reflection on beliefs or evidence. The active-pro c o h o r t u s e s ' T e c h n o l o g y ' a n d 'Chronic Health' topics more, the latter implying a general interest in healthy living. The differences were not statisti- cally significant across the remaining factors - 'Autism vs. Affect' and 'Government Vote'. H o w d o t h e t h e m e s d i f f e r b e f o r e a n d a f t e r a u s e r ' s f i r s t reference to vaccination? This analysis helps us capture any significant difference in a user's behavior across these two important phases. To divide a user's twitter timeline into the temporal phases, we locate the timestamp of her first vaccination tweet. Next, we group all tweet content into two respective buckets - pre p o s t s , c o m p r i s i n g o f tweets mentioned before user's first vaccine tweet and post content groups tweets after this timestamp (refer Figure 2 for count statistics). Recall that our MEM method had al- ready identified the underlying themes in the entire tweet corpus of the two cohorts. By performing an independent sample t-test across the pre and post groups, we are able to distinguish the themes across tim e (Table 3, Within Time). We find that users refer to 'Vaccine & Diseases', 'Autism vs. Effect' and 'Organic F o o d ' m o r e i n t h e i r post t i m e tweets compared to pre t w e e t .

They also start talking about autism in a more objective manner, mostly sharing information about the absence or presence of link between vaccine and autism. How do they present themselves? To investigate this, we turn to our LIWC results in Table 4. Again, we list only results with statistically si gnificant differences across co- horts, and call out a few results of note in the text. For in- stance, the active-anti c o h o r t u s e s s i g n i f i c a n t l y m o r e i n - group language, indicating their effort to invoke and main- tain social connections a nd group solidarity. Emotional differences were noteworthy with the active-pro c o h o r t exhibiting greater anxiety and the active-anti cohort greater anger. They also exhibite d extreme negative concerns through their higher rates of death related words. On the contrary, active-pro users focused more on the present , and had concerns about work and health (higher health and sexual category words). They also showed higher cognitive processing through their greater usage of causal a n d in- sight words , indicated an informal style by using more assents and non-fluencies and displayed lower assuredness through increased use of tentative , exclusions , interroga- tives a n d conjunctions . In contrast, active-anti u s e r s w e r e more certain (higher rates of certain words) and more di- rect in their language (fewer assents a n d non-fluencies ). They also exhibited a drop in immediacy (less present fo- cus), suggesting possible emo tional distancing, an often used coping mechanism to deal with acutely upsetting events (Holman and Silver 1998). Do their social media characteristics differ? Finally we examined the following social m e d i a c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s - 1 ) . Attention status ratio , is the ratio of followers (those who pay attention to the user) to following (those the user pays attention to) (Hutto, Yard i, and Gilbert 2013), (2). Message reach , the ratio of retweets and favorites to the total num- ber of tweets. (3). Amount of directed communication is the ratio of tweets with \"@\" mentions to total tweet count. (4). Informational content index is the ratio of tweets contain- ing a URL. As the distributi on of social network based measures deviates from normality, we compare these measures across the cohorts using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. We find that active-pro h a d g r e a t e r attention- status ratio w h i l e active-anti u s e r s h a d m o r e message reach . The extent of directed communication and informa- tional content index was not statistically different. Addi- tionally, to test for differences in the degree of engagement in the vaccine issue, we co mpute engagement as a propor- tion of tweets related to vaccination in the entire user time- line. We did not find any statis tically significant difference, suggesting that both the long-t erm advocates were equally vested in forwarding their opinions towards vaccination. Understanding Anti-Vaccination Joiners To understand the characteristics of people who join the anti-vaccination movement, we compare recent adoptees (joining-anti ) with those already perpetuating the move- ment ( active-anti ). What topics are relevant to them? To start, we pass the entire Twitter timelines of active-anti and joining-anti us- ers (1.32M posts in total) through the MEM analysis as before. We found that 10 fact ors, explaining 45.4% of the variance emerged from our dataset (see Table 5). We label Factor 1 'War News' because of its reference to terror and war ( terrorist, rebel, Syria ). The factor, 'Secret Govern- ment' contains terms referring to government's attempt to conceal information ( secret, cia, underground, caught, alert ). A parallel factor emerging from our analysis is 'Government Conspiracy' with t e r m s a l l u d i n g t o c o v e r t schemes ( bilderberg, imf, conspiracy, politics ). Here the term Bilderberg refers to th e Bilderberg group, which has often been accused of conspiracies (see (\"Bilderberg Group\" 2015)). Another simila r theme is the 'Vaccine Fraud' factor with terms refe rring to disbelief in vaccina- tion and government's attempt to hide the adverse conse- quences of vaccination ( coverup, omit, data, cdcwhistle- blower ). In particular, cdcwhistleblower w a s a f r e q u e n t l y used hashtag by people from the anti-vaccination camp to refer to the popular hoax story linking autism and vaccines (\"Snopes.com\" 2015). C o m p a r i n g f a c t o r s a c r o s s t h e active-anti a n d joining- anti user groups shows that joining-anti group refers more to 'Vaccine Fraud', whereas active-anti are more likely to Social & Identity Cog thinking & Tentative Ingroup A > P* Cause P > A* Emotion Insight P > A**** Anxiety P > A* Tentative P > A**** Anger A > P**** Exclusions P > A**** Linguistic Style Interrogatives P > A**** Assent P > A**** Conjunction P > A**** Non-fluencies P > A* Certainty A > P* Personal Concerns Work P > A* Time Orientation Death A > P**** Present Focus P > A** Biological States Engagement Health P > A**** Vaccine tweet prop Sexual P > A** Social Media Characteristics Attention Status P > A* Message Reach A > P* Directed Communication Information content index Table 4: Comparing the active-pro (P) and active-anti (A) co- horts. Statistically significant LIWC results based on independ- ent sample t-tests are listed. Social media characteristics are compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test. p-values are shown after BH correction to control familywise error-rate: * p (see Table 6). This provides additional evidence that those joining the anti-vaccination camp are specifically concerned about vaccination and a potential vaccine fraud, while the long-term anti-vaccination supporters have a broader agenda of government distrust. Comparisons over time show that anti u s e r s r e f e r m o r e t o ' V a c c i n e F r a u d ' and 'Chronic Health' post their first vaccine tweet. How do they present themselves? A s b e f o r e , t o u n d e r - stand how these two groups participate in the vaccine dis- cussion, we turn to comparisons across the LIWC measures (Table 7), calling out a few results of note. The active-anti users demonstrated higher cognitive complexity by using complex sentences (based on high preposition usage) and exhibited concrete thinking through their in- creased use of concrete nouns ( articles ). In contrast, join- ing-anti users signaled lack of definitiveness through high- er usage of interrogation, discrepancy, negation, exclu- sions and conjunctions words. Consistent with their cogni- tive concreteness, active-anti users also showed emotional distancing by their lower usage of positive emotion words compared to joining-anti . Also in line with their overly concrete expressions, active-anti group had higher personal concern for money and work . Joining-anti had higher rates of leisure words, which is consistent with their higher posi- tive emotion w o r d u s a g e . T h e y w e r e a l s o m o r e present focused and exhibited increased social orientation (higher social process and increased 2nd person pronoun usage) . Do their social media characteristics differ? We find that active-anti had greater attention-status ratio compared to joining-anti . The extent of directed communication, in- formational content and message reach was not statistically different between the two user cohorts. T a k e n t o g e t h e r , t h e s e c o m p a r i s o n s s u g g e s t t h a t t h o s e joining the anti-vaccination cohort are more social and less definitive - indicators of people who might join a cause or a group. Long-term anti-vacci nation supporters who are concrete and complex in thought had higher attention sta- tus ratio - indicators of people who could perpetuate a cause. Those joining also posted relatively more content about vaccination (higher engagement ), suggesting that for them this was, at least initially , a specific issue of interest, while for long-term anti-vacci nation advocates, vaccination appears to be one in a number of government conspiracy issues of interest. This general conspiracy thinking and cognitive mindset thus appears to provide the perfect net to catch people specifically concerned with vaccination. Discussion Anti-vaccine advocates mani fest conspiracy thinking Themes emerging from the tw itter history of anti-vaccine advocates refer to government conspiracy , deliberate vac- cine frauds , accusations of cover-ups by regulatory bodies ('Secretive Government' ) a n d c o n c e r n s o v e r t e r r o r w a r s ('War News') (see Table 5). In fact they had significantly higher mentions of vaccine fraud and chronic health con- cerns after their first mention of vaccination. This suggests an important characteristic of people holding unfavorable attitude towards vaccination: an inclination towards con- spiracy thinking - a w a y o f i n t e r p r e t i n g t h e w o r l d w h e r e conspiracy plays a dominant role (Zonis and Joseph 1994). It is worth noting that these conspiracy related topics sur- face as prominent themes amidst the millions of tweets expressed over multiple years. This suggests that conspira-Factors Words 1.

[link]\" The above example tweets from our anti users also align with research showing people's consistency with conspira- torial ideas: someone who believes in one conspiracy theo- ry, tends to believe others as well (Swami et al. 2011). This consistency is an artifact of people's tendency to maintain a coherent system of attitudes so as to strike internal and psychological consistency (B em 1970). For individuals with anti-vaccine attitudes, a paranoid world of conspiracy theories, secret, sinister or ganizations and manipulative government bodies causing harm are all part of their co- herent system of beliefs. Resoluteness towards anti-vaccination stance Our results present evidence of the strength and persistence of the underlying attitude convi ction of long-term anti- vaccine advocates. They showed relatively higher usage of concrete nouns, an indication of definitive expression (Ta- ble 4). They even used more certainty terms compared to their pro counterparts. This aligns with research examining dimensions of attitude strength and resistance towards change (Pomerantz, Chaiken, and Tordesillas 1995): a primary dimension of attitude strength is the degree of ex- pressed certainty. In contrast, active-pro a d v o c a t e s u s e d more indirect language. T h e e m e r g i n g M E M t h e m e s o f c o n s p i r a t o r i a l w o r l d v i e w also support active-anti cohort's persistence towards anti- vaccine attitudes. Social ps ychologists have argued that conspiratorial thinking serves as a \"cognitive shortcut\" that can be used to simplify and explain larger, more complex effects. This sense making function can lead people to con- spiratorial beliefs despite little e v i d e n c e t o w a r r a n t s u c h beliefs (Shermer 2011). This explains the conviction of active-anti cohort towards their anti attitudes over long periods of time. A more con cerning fact about conspirato- rial beliefs is their \"self-sealing quality\" - attempts to re- ject the theory may backfire and those very attempts may be characterized as further pr oof of conspiracy (Sunstein and Vermeule 2009). Hence conspiratorial beliefs are very hard to correct. This suggests that dispelling vaccination myths among long-term anti-v accine supporters might be very difficult, despite the amount of scientific evidence and rational arguments provided by government officials, sci- entific journals or other re gulatory bodies (Wolfe 2002). W h a t a b o u t e m o t i o n a l a p p e a l s t o d i s m i s s v a c c i n e myths? We find that complementing their cognitive con- creteness with decreased positive emotion expressions, long term anti vaccine advocates can be identified as cate- gorical thinkers - people whos e writing is more focused on objects, things and categorie s, marked by higher use of nouns, articles and prepositions (Pennebaker 2013). Such categorical thinkers tend to be emotionally distant. In con- trast, active-pro u s e r s c h a r a c t e r i z e d b y h i g h e r c o g n i t i v e processing and an informal expression style signal dynam- ic thinking (Pennebaker 2013). Thus, appealing to the emo- tional side of the anti-vaccina tion movement also is not likely to successfully change their attitudes. F i n a l l y , l o n g - t e r m a n t i - v a c c i nation advocates indicate a sense of group solidarity. Soci al psychologists have shown that higher ingroup language (like member, family ) is in- dicative of group unanimity and a sense of shared identity (Tausczik and Pennebaker 2010). Long-term anti- vaccination attitude holders' increased usage of ingroup language, greater attention-status ratio and farther message reach are indicative of higher group cohesion, particularly in comparison to their pro- vaccination counterparts. En- hanced group cohesion and message reach are useful prop- erties for establishing their beliefs as a movement and to recruiting new members into it. I n s u m m a r y , l o n g - t e r m a n ti-vaccination supporters are resolute in their conspiracy w o r l d v i e w s , a r e categorical thinkers not likely to be appealed to by emotion, and ex- hibit high group cohesion. In light of these results, we need new tactics to counter the damaging consequences of anti- vaccination beliefs. Drawing from Sunstein's work on con- spiracy theories, one possible strategy might be to intro- duce diversity in the closely-knit anti-vaccination groups (Sunstein and Vermeule 2009). Recall that anti-vaccination proponents display high ingroup characteristics. Weaken- ing the well-knit cognitive clusters of extreme theories by introducing informational and social diversity might reduce the pool of long-term anti-vaccination advocates.

Most im- portantly these themes are cap tured while tracking the us- er's entire twitter history and not just the posts after they start expressing anti-vaccine attitudes. This reveals a sali- ent trait of joining-anti u s e r s : t h e y s e e t h e w o r l d t h r o u g h the same paranoid lens as the active-anti u s e r s . I n o t h e r words, they are already predisposed to adopt anti-vaccine sentiments. A predisposition is a state of an individual which when activated by a stimulus makes a person re- spond preferentially to the stimulus (Rokeach 1968). T h e C D C w h i s t l e b l o w e r c o n t roversy is an example of how a social media-driven event can trigger people's preexisting disposition to cons piracy thinking and subse- quently provoke their attitudinal expressions that are coun- terproductive to society. Our current analysis cannot draw causal links from the event, but the timeline is highly sug- gestive: (a) people with prior indications of conspiratorial thinking start expressing anti-vaccine attitudes towards a topic after an event, where (b) the topic's anti-attitude is grounded in conspiracy theories and (c) the event itself is an alleged conspiracy event. Together this signals the pow- er that a single event can exert on attitude formation. In this case the attitude is detrimental to society. Additional research to explore and generalize how events impact atti- tudes at population scale and how to control damaging attitude formation triggered by an event are fruitful areas for social media-based social science. T h e l i n g u i s t i c a n a l y s i s r e s u l t s s h o w a n o t h e r c h a r a c t e r i s - tic of new adoptees of anti-vaccine attitudes: their lack of assuredness. Perhaps this lack of definitiveness nudges the predisposed minds of joining-anti cohort to latch on to the group of anti-vaccine advocates. We also find that they use more social expressions than their long-term counterparts, again a quality likely to make a person join a group (Gudykunst, Ting-Toomey , and Chua 1988). Limitations & Future Work Our user cohorts manifest th e biases of a population of active social media users e ngaged in discussing vaccine and health information onlin e. How representative their attitudes and opinions are of the general population is de- batable (Keelan et al. 2010) and this confines the generali- zability of our findings. Studies comparing users and non- users of social media sites have found higher usage among young adults, no significant gender differences and lower percentage of Native American users (Hargittai 2007). Fu- ture work can examine cohorts who are not heavy social media users but still have strong anti-vaccination views. How do such individuals diffe r from those relying on so- cial media to express vaccine opinions? W e w e r e a s t h o r o u g h a s p o s s i ble in choosing the search phrases used to collect vaccine specific posts. However the transient nature of social media sites might surface new search terms not included in our analysis. Hence our results are not exhaustive. In this regard, we created a high preci- sion rather than an all-inclusive but potentially noisy vac- cine post dataset. Third, our analysis is based on quantita- tive observations rather than experimentation. Thus we can describe \"what\" we observe, but our \"why\" explanations are not causal. Future work, both qualitative and experi- mentation on why pro or anti vaccine advocates exhibit certain attitudes would help deepen the understanding of this phenomenon. Finally, our results exemplify vaccine attitudes on just one social media platform: Twitter. We do not know how this translates to other sites. We hope that future research can build up on our findings and investigate vaccine discussions or more general health information debates on other social media sites and mainstream media. Conclusion Through a case study of the vaccination debate, we demon- strate how analysis of the natural language expressions and social media activities can paint a multi-faceted picture of attitudes around a factious topi c. Our study of principal actors in the vaccine debate in a key social media channel revealed that long-term an ti-vaccination supporters are resolute in their beliefs and they tend toward categorical thinking and conspiratorial w o r l d v i e w s . N e w a n t i - vaccination adoptees share sim ilar conspiracy thinking and hence are predisposed to develop attitudes aligned with the cohort of believers of vaccine myths. These new members tend to be less assured and more social in nature, but with a new and continued focus on health concerns. Our case study suggests that even a si ngle event, CDCWhistleBlow- er in this case, may be a sufficient trigger for these people to adopt an attitude and join a socially counterproductive movement. Given these findings, new interventions such as trying to weaken the long-t erm government conspiracy base of the movement are needed. References Engelmore, R., and Morgan, A. eds. 1986.
