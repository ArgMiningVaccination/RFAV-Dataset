This Is a much more balanced act,\" the bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Art Small, D-Iowa City, said Thursday night. The bill, modeled after similar acts passed In 15 other states, Is \"not nearly as strong as the Iowa City ordinance,\" according to Carol Ivie, director of the Citizens' Housing Center. \"There are not nearly as many restrictions on the landlord as were In the city ordinance,\" she said. Among the provisions of the bill, Small said, Is a statement of the landlord's obligations. The landlord will be responsible for keeping the apartment inhabitable -for example, supplying reasonable amounts of hot water and heat. \"The tenant obligations section Is almost a mirror of the landlord section. The tenant is obligated to keep the place in good shape,\" Small saId. Under the bill tenants would also be compensated when they made minor repairs on their apartments. \"If the landlord fails or refuses to make minor repairs, the tenant will be able to fix the item and deduct the costs from the rent,\" Small said. Serious problems between landlord and tenant might warrant use of the \"injunctive relief clause\" of the act. According to Ivie, if the tenant's health or safety is in jeopardy or there has been an abuse of access to the apartment by the landlord, the tenant can seek an in\u00ad junction to prevent further problems. A landlord could also seek an injunction in the case of serious tenant problems. Ivle said, however, this clause is Intended to be a last resort. The act was written to clarify things to the point where tenants or landlord would not have to go to the courts for such help, she said. I vi.e also said the remedies for violating the act will vary with the violations. The bill has undergone many changes, according to Small, but he said most of the changes have been \"minor\" and have dealt with specific wording. Small said ~ersions of \\he bill have been considered in committee in the past three years but never reached floor deba te. \"We got it out of committee once before, but it was In the closing moments of the session, about two years ago, and it never reached the floor,\" he said. One of the changes in this year's version concerns rent deposIts. In the original bill a landlord could charge a month's rent or the equivalent as deposit for an apartment, Ivie said. Landlords, however, asked that they be ailowd to charge three months rent or the dollar equivalent as a deposit. Legislators compromised and the act now permils landlords to require a maximum of two months rent as deposit. \"I'm bothered by this,\" lvie said. \"I think this is dangerous . What we con\u00ad sidered to be the lintit (one month's rent) is now the noor, and I'm afraid landlords who normally charge one month's rent as deposit wUl now charge two.\" U,.lod p, ... lmemalianai The 8III1h mo'led Waves from the angry sea off Scituate, Mass., pound Minot Light House in the af\u00ad termath of one of the worst storms to hit the Northeast in this century. Senate passes bottle~ can deposit legislation DES MOINES (UPI) -Legislation to require mandatory deposits on bottles and cans, the hottest legislative topic of 1978 and the target of an expensive assault by industry funded lobbyists, was approved 39-11 by the Senate Thursday and returned to the House. \"We began this debate with concern about conservation. You have now made the decision that we should attack that problem through the deposit approach,\" said Sen. John Scott, D-Pocahontas. \"We have an exceUent bill before us ... It is, first and foremost, an excellent example of the legislature responding to the wishes of the people.\" The upper chamber spent five days debating the bottle bill, before voting to strip the House-passed version of a tax on items that contribute to the litter problem and replacing it with what Senate backers said was a simple bill that would cut roadside litter, conserve on natural resources and save energy. Opponents, who waged largely un\u00ad successful efforts to amend the recommended Senate bill and replace it with tax proposals aimed at establishing cleanup programs and resource recovery and recycling efforts, contended the deposit plan would cost Iowa consumers up to $45 million a year in higher prices and restrict the freedom consumers now enjoy. \"The people I talk to indicate they're sick of government coming in and in\u00ad terfering in their lives,\" said Sen. Roger Shaff, R-CamclOche. \"This isn't going to stop litter. People are still going to heave bottles and cans out their (car) windows. We just have to learn government can't tell people how to live.\" The bill, which would be effective in August 1979, would levy a minimum S\u00ad cent deposit on soft drink and beer containers, as well as liquor bottles purchased by individuals. It would grant grocers and other retailers a l-<:ent per container fee for handling returned bottles and cans and holding them for distributors and manufacturers, who would pay the fee and see that the con\u00ad tainers were recycled or refilled. After two years, the fee would ~ reduced by half under a change approved Thursday. Throughout the five days of debate, Scott, floor manager of the bill, em\u00ad phasized It was geared toward conserving energy. By eliminating throwaway bottles and cans, he said the state would save the energy equivalent of 21 million gallons of gasoline a year. Supporters of the bill, which was pa tterned after a similar plan in effect in Vermont, repeatedly cited public opinion polls showing a vast majority of Iowans favor the mandatory deposit approach. However, its opponents stressed the potential cost to consumers, and that formed the basis or an intense, well\u00ad orchestrated lobbying campaign that inundated legislators with petitions showing tens of thousands of Iowans opposed the bill, while fewer than 1,000 wanted it. The anti-bottie bill campaign included a slick advertising blitz with a price tag In excess of $150,000. Chief spokesman for the lobbyists, former state Sen. Gene Kennedy, said money for the campaign came from soft drink, beer and bottle interests within and outside the state, aQd an army of lobbyists for and against the bill kept tabs on its progress. The deposit bill was an element of Gov. Robert D. Ray's legislative priorities for the 67th General Assembly and debate was strictly nonpartisan.

Non-striking \u00b7 meatcutters face lock-out By DON HRABAL Staff Writer All RandaU's food stores In eastern Iowa \"lOCked out\" their union meat\u00ad cutters Thursday night In retaliation for the meatcutters on going strike at Eagle's food stores. Louis DeFrieze, president of meat .. cutters union Local 431, received a telegram from William Shea, spokesman for the Randall's, Kroger, A & P, and Jewel Food stores, informing him of the lock-out Thursday. Renewed lebanese war feared BEmUT, Lebanon (UPI) -A third day of pitched artillery, mortar and machine gun battles between Syrian peacekeeping troops and Lebanese rightists Thursday sparked new fears of a resumption of the bloody civil war. Heavy rains dampened the fighting during the day but by sundown the roll of thunder milted with escalating artillery explosions in the neighborhoods of Ain Rummneh and Ashrafieh. Rightists said about :w people were killed and many civilians wounded, in\u00ad cluding rightist congressma n Michel Sassine, shot in the leg. Diplomals estimated more than 60 died since the first battIe Tuesday. Foreign Minister Fuad Butros went to Damascus Thursday for peace talks. The State Department said in Washington that its officIals were \"watchlnj( the situation closely and have been In touch with responsible officials on the scene.\" The lock-out will affect five meat\u00ad cutters at the Iowa City Randall's and six union mealcutters at the Coralville Randall's. The decision to lock out all union meatcutters is the result of a joint meeting of the various store managements held in Chicago Wed\u00ad nesday. The lock-out is in, retaliation against nearly 160 striking Eagle's meatcutters in eastern Iowa and western Illinois, according to John Cummings, regional manager for Randall's food stores. The lock-out stems from a strike by the Eagle's food stores which began Jan. 30, after contract negotiations broke down for the third time. The meatcutters were supported by a walkout of Teamsters union members and other warehouse personnel from Eagle's headquarters in Milan, nl., Monday. According to DeFrieze, the management for the grocery stores are Imposing the lock-out because \"they want to bust the pattern.\" For more than 30 years the meat\u00b7 cutters contract, which expired Jan.l4, ;., MElTCUTTERS . ON STRIK[ I 'c EAGLES . LOCAL UNION 431 has been \"patterned\" after the contract given to meatcutters of union Local 181, which serves Dekalb and Sandwich, Ill. Four months ago, meatcutters in Local 181 received a new contract that included a $2 per hour salary increase and an uncapped cost of living provision, DeFrieze said. The final offer Eagle's management offered its meatcutters was a $1.30 per hour salary increase and a maximum cost of living raise of 25 cents per month, DeFrieze said. DeFrieze asserted that expansion of the strike would cost Eagle's between $7 million and $8 million. \"They could have settled this strike tomorrow,\" DeFrieze said. \"We tried to offer them a peaceful settlement, and they turned around with something like this. \" DeFrieze said letters were sent out to , all meatcutters affected by the lock out advising them \"to clean up the meat\u00ad cutting area in the stores Thursday night, and if they are locked out Friday mor\u00ad ning to help picket at the Eagle's food stores.\" Meatcutters for Eagle's will recei ve week strike benefits, DeFrieze said. Meatcutters for Randall's will not receive strike benefits, but will most likely receive unemployment benefits because they have been locked (lut and are not striking. Marvin Hain, manager for the Coralville Randall's ,said, \"We will be locking out our people as of 6 tonight (Thursday night.)\" Paul Gerleman, meat manager at the Coralville store, said, \"Some employees will stick by the union and join picket lines at the Eagle's food store.\" However, Gerleman did not know how many of his meatcutters would join picket lines. Meatcutters for the Iowa City Ran\u00ad dall 's refused to comment about the lock\u00ad (lut or whether they would join picket lines at Eagle's. Referring to the possible addition of more meatcutters to the picket lines, one striker at Eagle's said, \"We all stick together. That's what a union is all about. \" Mel Schemmel, manager of the Iowa City Randall's store, said he will foUow his orders and lock out all union meat\u00ad cutters. Lee Roush, regional manager for Eagle's, said, \"We will continue to get meat from our usual sources, although we will be getting more boxed mea t than hanging meat, which is unusual.\" The meat counters will be serviced by supervisory and salaried employees, Roush said. Hain said there will not be a shortage of meat in the Coralville Randall's. \"We will have plenty of meat.\" Soviets play spy 9a\",8 to recruit Mountie OTIAWA (UPI) -Canada expelled 13 Soviet diplomats Thursday for trying to infiltrate the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in a \"classic\" spying scheme in which the Soviets passed orders in hollowed-out sticks and fake cigarette packs. \"The Canadian government had irrefutable evidence tha t all 13 had been involved in an attempt to recruit a member of the RCMP in order to in\u00ad filtrate the RCMP security service,\" External Affairs Minister Don Jamieson told a packed House of Commons. Soviet Ambassador Alexander Yakoulev was ordered to withdraw 11 Soviet officials, including the first secretary of the Soviet embassy and the Russian translator at the U.N. Inter\u00ad national Civil Aviation Organization. Two others who have already left Canada were barred from returning. \"This case proved to be a classic example of an Intelligence operation, involving complex signaling systems, coded passwords, secret concealed devices,\" Jamieson said. \"On diffe\u00ad rent occasions filmed instructions were passed to the RCMP member in a hollowed-out sick and a specially prepared package of cigarettes.\" Jamieson told the Soviet ambassador it was the fourth time Canada had expelled Russians for spying since December 1976 and warned the ac\u00ad tivities \"represent a serious setback in our bilateral relations.\" \"The firm action taken by the government in this case will remind the Soviet Union of our determination to deter foreign espionage,\" he said. Jamieson said the latest operation began In early 1977 when two Soviet intelligence officers approached a Mountie -whom he declined to i\u00ad dentify -and offered him an \"unlimited sum of money\" to spy for them. The officer, with authorization from the force, met seven times with First Secretary Igor P. Vartanian, the principal Soviet agent. \"The 12 other Soviet nationals identified with this operation were involved in different support functions including transportation, counter\u00ad surveUiance and regular weekly ob\u00ad servation activities,\" Jamieson said. \"The RCMP member was instructed by the agent to obtain Information on such subjecls as the methods the RCMP Security Service employed against Soviet intelligence services in Canada.

Page 2-The Daily Iowan-Iowa City, Iowa-Friday, February I', 19'78 Metal recycling program gets off to slow start Coach Olson, Dana Stevens and Your Dentist say Beat Tooth Decay! By TOM DRURY Staff Writer Public response to Iowa City's first effort in aluminum and steel can recycling is disap\u00ad pointing, Public Works Director Richard J. Plastlno said Thursday. Plastino said despite a very low response rate from the residents of Normandy Drive, the northwest Iowa City street where the pilot project is being carried out, there are no plans to shelve the project. The city refuse department, which picks up the cans on Normandy Drive once a week, has averaged about six pounds of aluminum cans and 100 pounds of steel cans or tin cans per week, according to Plastino. The cans are collected in a city pickup truck and the cost of the operation is almost negligible, Plastino said. But the money the city gets from selling the cans is also negligible, he said. . The recent price paid for scrap aluminum is around 14 cents per pound and the steel price is about 2 cents per pound, Plastino said. The refuse department usually makes about 30 stops each week on Normandy Drive, a community of 125 residences . He said he was surprised the participation rate was so low. Forums to test opinion on skills, core courses Residents of the drive are in a fairly high income group, and high income socioeconomic groups usually respond well to recycling program\u00a7, he said. A phone survey of 98 Nor\u00b7 mandy Drive area residents recently completed by Iowa City residen t Debra J. Woiraich, gave some possible reaSOh3 the program was not succeeding. Rhetoric and math skill requirements for the UI College of Liberal Arts will be the first areas examined in the UI's investigati on of current un\u00ad dergrauate degree requirements. The recently formed Com\u00ad mittee on General Education will hold its first open forum Feb. 16 at 3:30 p.m. in 106 Gilmore Hall. The forum will kick off a series of public meetings scheduled to gauge student and faculty opinion on the current general skills and core course requirements of the College of Liberal Arts. The committee, formed in January by Howard Laster, dean of the College of Liberal Arts, plans to evaluate the requirements and submit recommendations by May. Chairwoman Marleigh Ryan says the committee is going to rely on the open hearings for much of its information. \"I'm hinging a lot on the public forums,\" Ryan said. \"The committee currently Senate to consult court on tenants' group issue In an effort to clear up whether or not a recognized group violated budgeting guidelines, the VI Student Senate decided Thursday night to ask the UJ Student Judicial Court for an ad\u00ad visory opinion. The senate will ask the court to determine whether Tenants United for Action (TUA) violated the guidelines, and if so, what remedies are available to the senate. The senate is questioning whether TUA, which receives senate funding, violated budgeting guidelines by endorsing political candidates or whether the money spent for endorsing candidates came from funds other than mandatory student fees. If the money was generated by a subcommittee of TUA, it may have been a permissible expenditure. Endorsing a political candidate would make the group a political organization under senate guidelines and as such ineligible for senate funding. City, newsbriefs Courts A $75,000 lawsuit stemming from a salmonella incident which occurred in Iowa City in August was filed against Jose Taco restaurant in Johnson County District Court Thursday. Michael Lewis claims the restaurant failed to exercise reasonable care to see that the food served did not become contaminated. More than 20 people were stricken with salmonella poisoning on Aug. 29, 1977. Lewis is the second person to file suit against the restaurant. Parents of 12-year-old Anne Coleman are seeking $50,000 in damages in a lawsuit filed in Johnson County District Court Thursday against Clarence and Julie Leichty of rural Iowa City. The suit stems from an incident in which Coleman broke her left leg after a swing she was sitting on at the Leichty residence broke and landed on top of her. The Colemans claim the Leichtys were responsible [or the condition of the swing, which they claim was defective and dangerous at the time of the accident on Dec. 29, 1977. David Ogden, arrested for delivery of a controlled sub\u00ad stance, cocaine, in October, was found guilty by a jury in Johnson County District Court Thursday.

The neighborhood is not suitable for the program test, some suggested, because the residents used too few cans. It was suggested the program be tried near UI dorms. The floor will then be open for discussions \"concerning all sides of the issue.\" \"We hope to get people really stimulated on the subject and hear from all sides of the issue,\" said Ryan. Ten of the residents contacted said they would not participate \"either because they did not agree with the program, had no time to make the effort or had too few cans to bother.\" F(lllowing the series of hearings, which wUI also in\u00ad clude discussion of the physical education, foreign language and core course requirements, the committee hopes to submit recommendations to the UI Education Policy Committee. If approved by the committee, the recommendations will go before the College of Liberal Arts faculty.

CIA Director Stansfield Turner be given the power to run the entire operation. Committee Chainnan Birch Bayh, discussing the reorganl\u00b7 \",Uon proposal at a news C(JIIference, said it represents \"the most significant protection of rights since the Bill of Rights itJelf.\" But Bayh, D-Ind., also, In\u00b7 d1cated the legislation is likely to be heavily debated In Congress, since even its spon\u00ad sors do not agree fully \"with every part of it.\" Under the proposal, Turner would become czar of all America's spy and counterspy agencies and would be called director of national intelligence. The director would serve for six years, but the president could name a new CIA chief If he felt separating of the two jobs was necessary. As for spy activities, the new charters would not prohibit covert or clandestine opera\u00b7 tions, mail openings, break-Ins or bugglngs, and they would permit the CIA to continue disguising Its undercover agents as professionals ,In other Jobs. The agency also could contin\u00ad ue setting up businesses as front operations for spy and propaganda purposes. And while the legislation would prohibit the CIA from paying covert agents In the media, the academic field and religious organizations, provi\u00ad sions against such actions are worded ambiguously and ap\u00ad peared to leave gray areas. The measures do, however, have outright prohibitions against covert actions likely to result In assassination, ter\u00ad rorism, torture, mass destruc\u00ad tion of property, food or water shortages, epidemics, the over\u00ad throw of democratic govern\u00ad ments or human rights violations. They also would prohibit experiments on people and set guidelines for use of electronic surveillance, mail openings and break-ins. Vlolaters would be subject to prison terms up to five years and fines up to $10,000. In the proposed CIA charter -the first since the agency was established in 1947 -un\u00ad dercover operatives would be protected by a provision calling for five-year prison terms and $50,000 fines against govern\u00ad ment employees who publicly identify secret agents.

Gordon Liddy, the Watergate conspirator who signed a pauper's oath upon leaving prison, is challenging Internal Revenue Service allegations he owes more than $155,000 In Income taxes and penalties. President,\" disbursed $197,500 and retained $176,800 of the money \"for his own use and benefit.\" penalties be removed. Specifically, the IRS contends Liddy and his wife understated their 1972 taxable income as only $16,838.50. Taxes were listed as $3,494.78. ;).

In court records, Liddy said he was not advised of the sources of income upon which the IRS based its figures, and \"avers and affinns that his only source of income for the period in question were those itemized upon his return.\" Liddy \"admits that he acted as a conduit, courier, and messenger In his occupational position for The Committee to Re-Elect the President for certain funds during the period in question, none of which he retained for his own use or conveyed to others for his own personal use,\" according to documents filed by Liddy's lawyers. The IRS added the additional $176,800, and contended Liddy owed $107,027.30 on a taxable income of $194,271.46 plus a 50 per cent penalty because \"all or part of the underpayment of tax required, .. is due to fraud.\" The total owned is $155,298.78 including additional taxes and penalties, the IRS said. fA ~ Sio \"5 to China C Oriental -the look A of lotus & peacock, The regal phoenix in celestial gardens.

Democrat contribution lid lifted WASHINGTON (UP)) -The Federal Election Commission ruled Thursday the Democrats can ignore Watergate reforms and accept unlimited contribu\u00b7 tions to payoff the 1968 presidential campaign debts of Hubert Humphrey and Robert Kennedy. The ruling means that for the first time in a decade, the' Democratic National Commit\u00ad tee has the opportunity to be debt-free. Thedebt-nowdown to about $2 million -has crippled the party's organization even at a time when Democrats control the White House, two-thirds of the seats in Congress and three\u00ad quarters of the 50 gover\u00ad norships. By contrast, the Republican Party has built a multimillion\u00b7 dollar war chest for the 1978 midterm elections and plans to bring in millions more through a computerized direct mail solicitation . The FEC 'Voted unanimously to permit unlimited contribu\u00ad tions for paying off the Hum\u00b7 phrey\u00b7Kennedy debts since they were incurred before the election reform law went into effect in 1975. \"This will be the last hurrah fol' the fat cats,\" said com\u00b7 missioner Vernon Thomson, \"This law that was enacted to eliminate the fat cat from American politics has a glaring loophole, and the Democrats have jumped right into it.\" Treaty issue political pitfall The continuing party debt was cited as one reason Ken\u00ad neth Curtis stepped down as DNC chairman after just one year. New chairman John .White pledged at the committee meeting last month that if the FEC approved unlimited contributions, the debt would be paid off this year. White, a Texan with numer\u00ad nus wealthy friends in the oil business, is planning a series of fund\u00b7raising events to payoff the debt. . WASHINGTON (UP) - Democratic Leader Robert Byrd told the Senate Thursday it was not elected to blindly follow public opinion and should ratify the unpopular Panama Canal treaties \"in the best in\u00ad terests of the United States.\" But Republican Leader Howard Baker, who supports the pacts with some reserva\u00ad tions, said he sympathizes with senators asked to defy constitu\u00b7 ents in an election year. \"This issue is a killer, politically,\" Baker said as the ratification debate moved into its second day. \"It can devour you or kill you. You can't profit by it.\" Byrd, however, made it plain he Is weary of those who declare their hands are tied by antl\u00ad treaty public pressures. He said he supports the pacts on their merits, even though many of his West Virginia constituents do not. \"lowe them not only my attention,\" he said, departing from his prepared text to deliver an impassioned, ad\u00b7 libbed lecture. \"lowe them my judgment. That's why they sent me here. \"If I am to reach a judgment based only on the number of names on a petition or on the weight of the mail, what we need is a computer and a set of scales to represent the people of West Virginia in the United States Senate.\" Their comments focused at\u00ad tention on a background Issue that could doom the Canal treaties -the fact that American public opinion, as measured by polls and constitu\u00ad ent mail, is running heavily against the pacts despite President Carter's efforts to tum the tide. As Senate debate proceeded, Human rights situation improving, State says WASHINGTON (UP)) -The Slate Department told Congress Thursday there has been some improvement In the human rights sItuation around the world, but serious violations persist In such places as the PIillJppines, South Korea, Iran and IsraeU-occupied territory.

One example of general Improvement cited In the report Is a drop In the number of poUUcal prisoners In Iran from 3,700 to 2,200. In the Central African Empire, the government has dropped the practice of cutting off the right ears of some COOvicted thieves, \"partially as result of the extremely negaUve foreign reaction.\" But beating remains a common disCiplinary measure In PI'IIona.

Significant drop In the number of poUtical prisoners to \"fewer than 160.\" \\ the problem was illustrated at the White House by Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D\u00b7Neb., visiting at Carter's request to discuss the Canal Issue. Zorinsky said he personally favors ratification but will vote against it if a solid majority of his constituents remains op- posed. In his prepared speech, Byrd also said the treaties will cost the taxpayer some money - despite Carter's assurances they will not -but urged the Senate to ratify them \"in the best interests of the United States militarily, economically and politically.\" \" tVe Specifically, the FEC ruling says an Individual may contrib\u00ad ute more than the $20,000 limit in one year to the Democratic National Committee if the money goes to retiring debts incurred before Jan.

John Ooeldner, I II, 1178 Consumer protectIon On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives defeated legislation that would have, with expected Senate concurrance, created a federal office of consumer protection. Rarely is the business and industry stranglehold on the mechanisms of government so evident as in the debate and vote on this issue. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce hailed the House action as \"a truly remarkable victory\" and suggested that the members of the House had \"heard the voices of the American people, who are weary of too much government in their lives ... too much of what other people think is good for them.\" This is a curiously populist line to be coming from a business community that spends a healthy chunk of the consumers' money every year to convince potential customers that certain products are \"good for them.\" One can only wonder why businessmen are so threatened by the possibility of an agency designed to disperse the facts about these products, since these pillars of the community have the best interest of \"the 'American people\" at heart. House Republican Leader John Rhodes of Arizona also had some interesting comments to make as he urged defeat of the consumer protection legislation. \"Consumers are people,\" he asserted, \"and people are smart. They don't need any help at the supermarket.\" He made these remarks in spite of the fact that the presence of him and many of his colleagues in positions of power stands as a tangible refutation of his assessment of \"people,\" assuming that voters are also people. The people who are really weary, of course, are the businessmen and industrymen themselves, and what they are tired of are governmental attempts to make them be honest and fair with their customers and produce safe, efficient and dependable products. They have the money and organization to advocate their positions before federal regulatory agencies - not to mention their diversionary and stalling tactics -and thereby circumvent the intent of regulatory legislation . Con\u00ad sumers have no such clout, and thanks to the business\u00ad influenced votes of the House of Representatives, they will have no agency within the federal government to give them that clout. There ha ve been cogent arguments raised against the creation IIf a federal consumer protection office, but they have not been based on a populist facade of opposition to the oppressiveness of more government. They have been based instead on the proven incompetence and ineffectiveness of government agencies. Perhaps, it has been argued, consumers are better off knowing they are without protection than in assuming the false and un\u00ad critical sense of security that would accompany the assurances IIf a federal agency that they are being looked out for. The best argument against big government, after all, is not that it's a big brllther but that it's a weak sister (to carry out that particular sexist methaphor). Ralph Nader, in his response to the vote, warned that con\u00ad sumers would organize to defeat representatives who opposed the bill. If it is possible for consumers to organize, they would probably be better off organizing to protect themselves. rather than investing a federal agency with that responsibility . Perhaps all we have lost is another sleeping, toothless wal- chdog. . What is infuriating about the House action is the deceitful posturing of the business and industry groups whll have opposed the consumer protection bill and the pathetic arguments of their House errand boys. They could have scarcely provided us with a more graphic demonstration of the need for consumer protec\u00ad tion. WINSTON BAReLA Y Editorial Page Editor ! ' Supression It seems the federal Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA), which has provided us with such dandy gizmos as the neutron bomb, is misnamed . They are a lot more interested in development than in research. Professor Richard MancusII of the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health was conducting an ERDA\u00ad funded study on the incidence of cancer in workers at the government-owned Hanfor\" .. Wash., atomic power plant. He found that out of 743 w(,rkers at Hanford who have died of cancer, 35 must be classified as \"excess deaths\" -deaths above what would be expected in a normal population. This was more than ERDA could take. They tried to convince Mancuso to release an earlier version of his findings which did not report the high incidence of cancer. Mancuso refused because the earlier studies were based on incomplete evidence and would have painted a false picture of conditions at Hanford. ERDA then abruptly terminated Mancuso's contract, and his research project was halted. Mancuso's findings were made public in testimony before a House subcommittee. This was not the first study to be critical of Hanford. Samuel Milham of the Washington state Social and Health Services Department reached the same conclusions as Mancuso in a 1974 study of Hanford, but was convinced by the Atomic Energy Commission not to publish his results. Obviously, pressure is being applied to keep the bad news about Hanford from reaching the public. The most obvioUs source of that pressure is ERDA. But one should keep in mind that the present governor of the state of Washington, Dixie Lee Ray. was chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission at the time of the suppression of Milham's findings, and she is one of the nation's most ardent defenders and promoters \u00b7 of atomic power plants. ERDA's motivations in the attempted squelching of Mancuso are transparent. There is growing concern among the general public over the safety of atomic power plants. Public confidence in them, never very strong in the first place, is wavering. ER\u00b7 DA, in the meantime, is promoting atomic plants. A study like Mancuso's, if critical of such plants, would reduce public con\u00ad fidence even further. So ERDA stopped Mancuso's research, doing the cause of atomic power and themselves more damage than Mancuso ever could. It would have been bad enough if they just stopped Mancuso. But before they stopped him, they encouraged him to lie by releasing an incomplete, and thus misleading, report. Such a practice, common enough in bureaucracies, is made even more shocking when you realize human life is involved. If atomic power plants are as safe as we are led to believe by those who promote and build them, why are studies like Mancuso's halted? If a tomic power plants are so unsafe as to cause a disease as horrible as cancer in the workers there, why is the public, and often the workers themselves. not told? The way energy research and development is now progressing -slowly -we may in the end have no choice but to tum to atomic power to meet our energy needs. By that time, perhaps methods of producing atomic power can be found that will reduce its inherent and appalling dangers. But when the government agencies involved In energy research and development are so blithe to withhold information from the public that is so dependent on them, confidence in those agen\u00ad cies, and in the types of energy they promote, must remain low. MICHAEL HUMES Assoc. Editorial Page Editor Harsh\u00b7 observations on American Indian roots The Cape Cod vUlage of Mashpee has been made eligible for emergency low-interest loans and other forms of economic assistance by the federal Small Business Administration. This small Massachusetts community of\u00b73,000 persons hasn't been hit by a tidal wave, or a nor'wester or a hurricane. Only by a lawsuit. In August of 1976 a group of Mashpee citizens, representing themselves to be members of the Wampanoag Indian tribe, filed suit in Federal Court claiming all the land in the community was theirs. Although Indians have been selling land to non-Indians for the past 108 years, their claim is based on provisions of a 1790 federal law forbidding the transfer of any Indian-owned land without he approval of Congress. Until recent court decsions, it has been assumed the law did not apply to the 13 original states where large tracts of real estate had been bought, stolen and tricked out of Indian hands long before there was a Congress. The upshot of the Mashpee suit has been to cast such doubt over the validity of titles and deeds that business in the community has been ad\u00ad versely affected. Hence the Small Business Administration disaster relief. A few days ago a jury hearing the case decided that, while aWampanoag tribe existed in a legal sense in 1834 and in 1842, no such tribe existed in 1790 , 1869, 1870, and 1976, all dates crucial to the successful prosecution of the claim. No one has yet come forth to explain how a tribe could not exist in 1790 and then reappear in 1834. The an\u00ad swer may be that the law, as Dr. Johnson said, is an ass. The rest of us aren't looking too good on the Indian question either. A number of other nicholas von hoffman Indians in the sociological, if not the legal meaning of the word, have filed suit alleging breach of the same 188 year-old federal statute. Actions are pending elsewhere in Massachusetts, in Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut and Maine where the Passamaquoddys and Penobscots are asking for about two-thirds of the states. Don't laugh. A referee IlPpointed by President Carter has recommeded that the Indians be awarded 25million federal dollars and 100,000 acres. There is something ludicrous about the United States trying to rectify the wrong of theft com-mitted 200 years ago while it backs Israel in thefts committed against Egypttwo days ago. Time does not make a crime any less of a crtme, but it does make it impossible to restore the stolen property without committing yet new and possibly worse crimes. That's why no reasonable person would suggest that the land taken from the Palestinian Arabs be returned. At some point, bygones must be declared bygones. We can't make It up to the Indians or the original Americans, as it is becoming fashionable to call them for some unaccountable reason. They got hosed but so did the Druids. History and archeology team with societies, peoples, languages and cultures which are no more.The Roman empire got offed by theVandals and the Visigoths, so should the modern-{!ay Italians sue? All they can do is learn a dead language; they can't bring back Julius Caesar. A similar situation exists\u00b7 with American Indians. Their culture cannot survive in a technological society where we play computer games in our living room. It's too bad, because the blankets, the jewelry, the songs and the at\u00ad oneness with nature compel the admiration of Americans concerned about the future of the countryside and the wild places. That does not make Indians a special case. The Pennsylvania Dutch farmers with the 16th century culture are going, too. Even culture. in people who superficially look unchanged are utterly different today than from the way their ancestors lived In 1790. The Polish peasant who labored in serfdom for his lord now perhaps labors for his commissar, but it's a totally dIf\u00b7 ferent serfdom. For government policy to encourage Indians to . remain culturally Indians is to make them little better than tragic c1owns.The suddenly oll\u00b7rlch Indian in the high black hat with the pigtails driving a Cadillac is long since a stock figure in our ethnic comedy; the starving reservation Indian holding on to the papoose child Is a stock figure for our tears. With the enthusiasm for knowing one's roots, these may seem like harsh observations . But it is one thing for Kunta Kinte's descendants to study him, know about him and honor him, and quite another to go back to Africa and live like him. There Is no time warp; a policy encouraging tribalism and half.forgotten nomadic hunting and fishing cultures Isn't going to give the Red Man Justice or preserve his dignity. It's only going to make him look like a mannequin in a diorama or an actor in the Indian village section of some second-rate, imitation Disney World.

'I 1'0 Th,' Editor; Once again. the small white signs proclaiming a Mcn:Xl \"Cerebration\" are scattered around the call1pus. I wonder whether these people have really considered the purposes ?nd assumptions LeHers underlying such \"cerebrating.\" Just what is Mensa? Why do its members llIeet? As [ understand it, their official justification isfor people to enjoy the company of others with whom they have something in comlllon, where the shared characteristic is superior intelligence . I can appreciate this point -just as members of a bridge club meet because they all enjoy bridge, Mensa meets because its members enjoy intelligence . Of course, bridge is an activity whereas intelligence is a characteristic, but one can save the analogy by regarding the activity of Mensa as something like \"intelligent interaction\" or \"stimulating conversation.\" Surely this is legitimate. However, 1 suspect tha t most people not in Mensa do not take this line very seriously. The simpler, more direct explanation is that Mensa is an ego trip. It is a gathering of superior in\u00ad telligence. with stress on superior rather than intelligence. One has images of perfumed 18th century aristocrats or Hitler's Aryans ... It is a. question of theory versus practice -intelligent camaraderie in theory; elitist mutual ad-miration in practice. Mensa could be a worthwhile and legitimate organization. but I think it is not. If intelligence and not superiority is the driving force, why institutionalize it in an organization? Why define membership by purely quantitative test scores? Why address the problem of attracting new members with such cute, punning \"cerebration\" notices that also trot out the test score one must have to be worthy to associate with Mensa people? In the \"real\" world, away from number 2 pencils and little circles on computer score\u00ad sheets, one definition of intelligence is adap\u00ad tability. The classic example Is the exit of the stupid dinosaurs. Why then is Mensa so im\u00b7 membership? ... Eric Meyer 13 N.

I'm talking about rape, in\u00ad cest, bestiality. infanticide, torture, acts of high treason, prostitution, seduction and betrayal. I have witnessed sucli abominations on my television screen without benefit of a single Schlitz beer commercial. If you are interested, forget it. The spectacle came to an end on the evening of Jan. 29 when Alistair Cooke closed out the final episode of I. Claudiu.~ . If you did not see the series, then it is likely my catalogue will sound farfetched for prime time viewing. Not only did everything above take place, but they pulled it off with such flare that It may very well be the best dramatic series of the year. I. Claudius broke every rule of commercial television and that is how they managed to get away with their subject matter. The program proved that it is not content, but the manner in which content Is presented that distorts our values and reinforces the wrong . behavior. If anything, we would have to see the series as an object lesson in the follies of man, but done with such professionalism that we are willing to take the propaganda along with the drama. It is worth a look at what made this a successful series, even if you did not see the programs because, without exception, the crucial elements are handled differently by the commercial networks, and with very different results. The actors. A poor troupe of actors could have reduced I. Claudlu.~ to an erotic soap opera with historical overtones. These actors were credible. They were round personalities, and in being full they made themselves both interesting and immune to easy interpretation. A major network would have flooded the series with familiar faces, working on the principle that over-expo!ure breeds success, that the better known the actors are totheir audience themore liKely they will watch the performance .'\u00b7 We have all been sucked into this exploitation and we have all been disappointed with the results. It is even worse for the actor who wants til play a believable role. A barrier has been Cflnstructed between actor and audience, the barrier (If familiarity. With a team of actors brought in from England we do not have such problems. so actors can be actors and audiences Digressions william mueller can be audiences, with terrific results. Manipulation . The degree to which ob\u00ad jectionable material is transformed into ef\u00ad fective drama depends on Its dramatic manipulation. The techniques used were old standards for the theater: tempo changes, crisis, dramatic tension, juxtaposition, Irony, suspension of disbelief and ambiguity. Somehow. the notion that drama does not adapt to television has become a rela tlvely accepted belief. Drama is that art form we drag out once a year for purposes of edification . We watch some historical reenactment, feeling quite pious, and then at awards time the whole gang receives an Emmy and we are glad to have been part of the audience. I. Claudiu.9 did what aU the Masterpiece nlcol.'\" series do -It entertained and In\u00b7 structed; but, In addition, It grabbed the two most controversial aspects of commercial television, sex and violence, and managed to reinstate some of the significance connected with these themes. The manipulation done on commercial television is intentionally heavy-handed. The networks only become subtle in their com\u00b7 llIercials. There is a rule uperating based on the degree (If obviousness a scriptwriter can inject into the plot, so that the cruder the characterization, the straighter the line of plot, the more success we can predict. I find programs that are crude in their manipulation to be in\u00ad sulting, boring and contrary to drama, which has as its express purpose the task of surprising me. Knowing that the networks are not trying to put on drama never eases the pain. Comedy. The Claudius seri.es never resembled a situation c(lmedy, and yet there was more cumedy in it than I have seen on any slt-com in years. The humor was used to break tension. It made various people, especially the tyrants, approachable. Livia and CaJigula would have been monsters who threatened the credibility of the entire program had it nol been for the many spots of humor injected into their characters. By the same token, when the writers were ready to kill these people off, the first thing they did was to take away the humorous element. Instantly nur ambivalence towards them solidified and we cheered their deaths. The comedy reinforced the drama by giving the viewer some balance she-he needed to keep absorbed in the plot. By contrast, commercial teievisilln gives you either sober \"drama\" or mindless hilarity in the fonn of stream-of\u00ad consciousness one\u00b7lIners. Because the one\u00b7liners have no plot to hang upon they become tedious. We must concentrate on them, and no joke can take such concentration. It is probably true that Masterpiece Theater looks good because of the lack of direct com\u00b7 petition. It may also be true that to multiply the lIhow by twelve would over..aturate the market. We know that in England they have just as much terrible stuff as we get here. It Is also true that because the actors are relatively unknown in this country Iheir perfonnance has a greater impact than would (lur (lWn actors. But even granting all this, the fact remains that the major networks persist in using techniques that fail to excite the public, even when they have available to them other models. Why must we have this cult of IIver-exposure when it ruins th~ actors and alienates the viewers? Why must we bastardize art In the name IIf democracy or mass tastes or whatever you wish to call it, when clearly the public is not grateful for such slop. It is not whether the public wants to have art, or if they will rise to It, but how you manage to get the job dune thaI counts. I cClncede there Is a need to stratify television for various tastes. The cream would cease to be the cream if we raised all programming to the high 5t level; yet the lither side of that argument is to ask why the rest IIf the mix has til be so unifonlily horrible. If we learn anything by such a program as this, it ought to be that content is not as important as context.

STP false ads cost $ ~ ml11ion WASHINGTON (UPI) -In the largest false advertisement settlement on record, the STP Corp. Thursday was fined half a million dollars. and agreed to retract published claims its oil treatment reduced oil consump\u00ad tion by up to 20 percen t. Under a settlement approved by a New York federal court and announced by the Federal Trade Commission, STP agreed to publish notices in newspapers and magazines to inform the public the road tests on which it based its advertising claims were unreliable. the public.\" Kramer said the notices -to appear today In the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and The Washington Post, and In news magazines - is unique since it tells readers \"that prior statements were in violation of the law.\" He said the message, to be carried in publications read by 78 million adults, should go \"a long way toward correcting any lingering misimpressions caused by the original adver\u00ad tisements.\" The settlement followed a complaint filed by the FTC alleging that STP violated a previous commission order issued in 1976 against false advertising. In addition to the $500,000 penalty, the company will have to spend $200,000 publishing the notices. Kramer said the previous high-water mark for a civil penalty in a false ad\u00ad vertising case was in the vicinity of $300,000. Kramer told reporters the tests apparently were in error because the STP was counted as part of the total oil supply even though it had been added to the oil. The testers failed to deduct the STP in figuring how much oil had been used. Nailen said the settlement \"is in no way any challenge to the efficacy of the product.\" He said the tests in question were \"very confused\" and he does not believe the settlement will have any affect on STP sales. The ads in question ran in 1976 and 1977. largely in print media but also on television. In ad\u00ad dition to claiming reduced oil consumption, the tests also alleged STP's \"double oil filter\" was superior to other oil filters -something the FTC said tests did not substantiate. Albert Kramer, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the settlement was significant because \"in certain cases it is no longer sufficient for an advertiser simply to stop making decep\u00ad tive advertising claims and 'go and sin no more.' Coal bigwigs, foes both win \"Rather, the advertiser has a duty to undo the harm caused by correcting the former misleading statements.

Griffin Bell said Thursday he'd change the way he dismissed Republican prosecutor David Marston of Phlladelphia if he had another chance, but will not apologize for the \"trauma\" it caused. \"I'm certainly not apologizing,\" Bell said in closing a 78-minute \"press ('ollf':l \"rlce to end all press conferences\" in which he reviewed his)1 <lr-Iong effort to place selection of U.S. attorneys lin a merit basis. \"I think I ve done a good job as attorney general- a good job in a bad situation,\" Bell said. \"I'm certainly not apologizing. I didn't put the American people in this trauma. I would like to lighten the trauma.\" Bell said from now on he intends to \"negotiate\" with incumbent federal prosecutors he wants to replace. Bell said he underestimated the depth of feeling the Marston dismissal would stir in Philadelphia and throughout the country. He made a mistake, Bell said, in not explaining his side in a news conference the day he fired Marston. \"I abandoned the field\" to Marston, said Bell. But he said he won't make that mistake again. \"Oh,l'll be extremely careful,\" he said, as reporters joined him in laughter. \"You'll never get me again in this trap.\" But Bell sa id he had decided mon ths before getting a prod from Presidpnt Carter that he intended to replace Marston despite a Carter campaign pledge to remove politics from the Job. \"The day I read in the paper that Marston said he was not leaving, he was gone,\" Bell said.

A shuttle of huge cargo planes droned down with more troops and machines to battle near house-high snow drifts and aid thousands left homeless by the highest Atlantic tides of the century. One supermarket chain said it was managing to replenish stocks of perishable food items in many stores in the food\u00ad short Boston area. Gov. J. Joseph Garrahy, quarterbacking Rhode Island's battle against mammoth snow drifts, donned a change of clothes for the first time in four days. Broadcasters in Connecticut found it worthwhile to resume morning rush hour traffic reports for the first time since the great blizzard hit Monday. Soldiers from Georgia in winter garb began moving thousands of snow-covered cars and trucks in Rhode Island to reopen three key interstate highways. Other federal troops and National Guardsmen la\u00ad bored to clear roadways in the Boston area. A new storm on the Great Plains of the West, however, caused delays in the rescue airlift and an uncertain threat of new snows for the snow\u00ad clobbered East. The Military Airlift Com\u00ad mand, which said 600 troops had been flown to New England, reported other troops and equipment were unable to get away from Texas airfields because of serious icing on runways. The storm piled snow 10 in\u00ad ches deep on Oklahoma , closing schools and hampering travel, and left up to six inches on the Texas Panhandle . It moved eastward into Arkansas, where a man and four of his children were burned to death in a farm home fire blamed on overloading of a wood stove. The nation's weather-related death toll so far this week mounted to 84, all but 14 victims of the Eastern snows. For the winter of 1978, the toll stood at 271.

If similar results occur as the study continues, the research\u00ad ers said the drug could save the lives of as many as one of every three persons who otherwise would die during the first year after recovery from a heart attack -perhaps 15,000 Americans annually. The drug is called sulfinpyra\u00ad zone and has been sold as Anturane since 1959 by the Ciba\u00ad Geigy Corp., of Summit, N.J., to lower uric acid levels in gout victims. Doctors noted over the years that sulfinpyrazone seems to interfere to a slight degree with the blood clotting process in gout patients. When a clot lonns in a narrowed artery leading to the heart, a heart attack can result. It was decided In 1975 to see what happened'to cardiac death rates when one group of heart attack patients was given sulfinpyrazone four times a day and another group a dummy pill. A total of I,m patients at 21 American and five Canadian medical centers was studied for an average of 8.4 months. The results were published in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal 0/ Medicine. Sixty-eight cardiac deaths occurred in the entire group, 44 in the group of 742 taking the placebo and 24 in group of 733 taking the drug. When the statistics were corrected for exposure time, the report said 'there was a 48.5 per cent reduction in overall cardiac mortality in the sulfinpyrazone group. The study was designed to continue for one year, but the report said, \"The demonstra\u00ad tion of a significant benefit from active therapy in the reduction of cardiac mortality required that these results be reported and all trial patients be in\u00ad fonned.\" All patients in the study will be advised of the results. Doctors will seek patients' pennission to continue the test even though they do not know if they are receiving the real drug Rockefeller: life quality, abortion safety at issue WASHINGTON (UPI, -The only real question about abortions should be \"whether they will be safe or unsafe,\" John D. Rockefeller III told House members Thur\u00ad sday. least the chance to lead a life of satisfaction and purpose, to achieve more in life than mere survival.\" He also spoke of the need to recognize a new role for women. \"Abortions will not go away if they are illegal, the 71-year-old philanthropist told the House Select Committee on Population , which has been holding hearings this week on all issues involved in world population growth. \"There is only one question really at issue in regard to abortionsj namely, whether they will be safe or unsafe,\" Rockefeller said, and the quality of life for both the mother and \"the unwanted child\" should be considered. \"There has been too much of a tendency to see women only in their reproductive role as wives and mothers. It is time more attention was paid to their productive roles, as im\u00ad pHrtant contributors to the social and economic life of every country.\" Rockefeller, chairman of the Population Council, cited evidence from Latin America where he said illegal abortions are \"en\u00ad demic.\" He was referring to the theory that as women take jobs, they will be freed from traditional child-bea ring roles and the resulting increase in material wealth will act -as it historically has -as a brake on population growth. He agreed with other witnesses -including those who oppose government popUlation control efforts -that the fear of a world with nut enuugh food for its people no longer is well founded. Another witness, U.N. population expert Ge!lrge Stolnitz, testified that people all over the world are living longer and apparently having fewer babies, with the fertility rate falling faster than the life span is increasing. \"This formulation equates people with animals and food with fodder,\" Rockefeller said.' The real reason for cuntrolling population . he said, is to give eveny person \"at He said the world's popUlation recently exceeded four billion and is growing at slightly less than 2 per cent a year toward six billion by century's end. Longer-run projections, Stolnilz said, indicate a possible population of 8.5 billion by 2025. Soda makes kids rise, too SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) - Doses of ordinary baking soda have been used successfully to reverse stunted growth in children, doctors at the Univer\u00ad sity of California announced Thursday. The medical breakthrough was announced at a news conference at which the doctors said the baking soda reversed impaired growth in eight children and prevented it in two others, all suffering from a kidney ailment that had ham\u00ad pered their development. Mark Spoon, 13, of Santa Rosa, Calif., who was as big as a 2-year-old when he was 5 but now is 5-foot-4 after taking the baking soda therapy, said: \"I just take sodium bicarbon\u00ad ate (baking soda, pills before breakfast, lunch, dinner and bedtime. I play basketball and football. but mv mom says not Congressman-doctor's 'quackery' alleged ATLANTA (UPI) -A Texas medical expert testifying at the $6- million Laetrile malpractice trial of physician-congressman Larry McDonald said Thursday that nutritional treatments of cancer constituted the \"most prevalent fonn of quackery. \" Laetrile. a substance derived from apricot pits, is also known as vitamin 8-17 and amygdalin. Its proponents subscribe to the theory that cancer may be caused by a nutritional deficiency which can be corrected by taking Laetrile with a special diet. Dr. Emil Freireich, while denouncing nutritional treatments alone, acknowledged that the role of nutrition, when combined with traditional drugs, has always been an \"area of great im\u00ad portance\" in cancer treatments. Freireich is head of the University of Texas Cancer Center in Houston. The researcher-physician was called testify by attorneys for the plaintiffs, the family of the late J,ohn L. Scott, a Bir\u00ad mingham, Ala., postman who suffered lung cancer and died in 1974 after receiving Laetrile from McDonald. The suit contends Scott might have lived longer had he received conventional cancer treatments, rather than Laetrile administered by McDonald . Judge Richard Freeman, who has become increasingly irrita t\u00ad ed by discussion during the trial of the pros and cons of the con\u00ad troversial Laetrile, refused to allow that word mentioned in his courtroom. He has repeatedly pointed out that McDonald is on trial, not Laetrile. WHEELROOM PROUDLY PRESENTS to get involved' with things like wrestling that could hurt my kidneys.\" Dr. R. Curtis Morris, one of the pioneering physicians , said the breakthrough was the first success against stunted growth involving children stricken with renaItubular acidosis (RTA), in which kidneys fail to nush normal amounts of acid out of the system, thus impairing growth. He said some youngsters receive the therapy from their parents in the fonn of baking soda mixed with plain water, but warned, \"The worst thing tha t could happen would be to give it willy-nilly to every kid who's short.\" A doctor's guidance is essen\u00ad tial because indiscrimate use could cause hann, he said. Morris and Dr. Elisabeth McSherry, both pediatricians, cunducted the tests a t the university 's San Francisco divi\u00ad sion, and it was so successful that a parent, Roberto Vil\u00ad lagomez. of Sangor, Calif., said of his 10-year-old daughter, who began treatment as an infant: \"She's big compared to her classmates. She's going to be taller than me.\" The child, Valentina, grew four inches in two months when given the baking soda therapy a decade ago, and, like the other youngsters, she will probably have to keep up the treatment up for the rest of her life.

Of the 400,000 who survive to be discharged from the hospital, 47,000 die during the first year after the attack. Dr. Arnold Reiman, editor of the New England Journal, said most of these deaths are caused by erratic heart action (arr\u00ad hythmias) and often occur without evidence of a new heart attack. \"So it must be assumed that sulfinpyrazone in some manner prevented fatal arrhythmias,\" he said in an editorial. \"How this effect might have occurred can only be conjectured at this point. \"At the moment, however, wh~t seems important is that a drug heretofore useful only as a uricosuric agent has now been demonstrated to be effective and safe in the reduction of sudden cardiac dea th during the risky months after a fresh myocardial infarction (heart attack).\" He said it is important to determine if the drug's initial beneficial effect continues, but Reiman said the risk of death diminishes after the first few months following a heart at\u00ad tack.

Somalia announced last week it had captured one Cuban soldier in the fighting. Hassan repeated charges of Soviet and Cuban involvement Thursday, He said Somali's sovereignty had been violated repeatedly by the Soviets and Cubans in a series of air raids, the last Tuesday upon northern cities of Hargeisa and the port of Berbera, where the Soviets had bases until Somalia kicked out its Russian advisers last November. (In London, the Somali Embassy issued a statement alleging Russia and Cuba were \"taking exclusive combat responsibilities in the field.\" ( \"The overall operational com\u00ad mander is a Russian general,\" Soviet troops were manning tanks as well as aircraft and \"the Cubans were put in charge of artillery and engineering services and were used as airborne troops,\" the Somali statement said.) Hassan said Somali forces had not seen any Ethiopian ground forces involved in the conflict in the week since an Ethiopian offensive began on two fronts in the Ogaden. He said most fighting was con\u00ad ducted by Soviet and Cuban soldiers manning mechanized equipment and backed by Ethiopian warplanes.

(In Washington , U.S. officials said Soviet cargo ships, capable of carrying 1,500 additional troops, were steaming to the Red Sea from Angola.) DOONESBURY Ethiopia also called on retreating Somali forces in the Dgaden desert war to surrender and anounced it has drafted a women's militia into the frontlines of the fighting. tanks and other military equipment and an estimated 1,500 Soviet soldiers are also in Ethiopia to train the army. The diplomats said Ethiopian Airlines flights had been canceled in recent days and it was reported the aircraft were being used to ferry in 1,500 reinforcements to help the general offensive, two pro-Western guerrilla groups in the former Portuguese colony two years ago, U,S, government sources in Washington said four Soviet cargo ships were en route to the Red Sea from Angola, the Black Sea and South Yemen, Diplomatic sources said 3,500 Cubans were already in the country aiding the Ethiopian army in its week\u00ad old major offenseive in the Dgaden and an airlift from Angloa was ex\u00ad pected to raise the total to some 5,000.

Thi asked the United Nations to intervene with Washington in the case. U,S. delegate James F, Leonard told the U,N. Commit\u00ad tee on Relations with the Host Country that Washington had tried to discuss the issue with the Vietnamese in advance, but that \"after an initial contact Feb. 1, they refused to discuss the situation further with us.\" Leonard also indicated the United States had no intention of backing down on the ex\u00ad pulsion order, issued by the State Department Feb, 3, Thi, who first vowed to remain at his U ,N. post in defiance of the order, has been instructed by Hanoi to return home, \"My government hopes a new permanent representative (from Vietnam) will be named shortly and that this unfortu\u00ad nate matter will be closed,\" he said, Thi, whose country is the 149th and newest member of the United Nations, became the first ambassador in the 32-year history of the world body to be ordered out of the United States. The expulsion order came after a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., named him as an unindicted co-conspirator in an espionage ring conducted by U ,S, Foreign Service officer Ronald L, Humphrey.

In fact, it's depressing. But the honesty and truth he has revealed through his creations have made him one of America's leading filmmakers. The Long Goodbye is especially important because Allman takes a specifiC genre -the detective film -with all its conventions, and enables us to compare his film with others in the genre and see clearly what he Is about. In The Long Goodbye Altman brings his cynical eye to bear on a classic detective -Raymond Chandler'S Philip Marlowe - and reworks the detect! ve convention with his own metaphysical concerns. To begin wiUt, Marlowe does not operate within a sharply defined order of good and bad. Society and the people in It are corrupt and Marlowe has to follow his noble pursuits through this amoral swamp. Only Marlowe subverts his own self-interests for an inner moral code. While everyone else manipulates Marlowe for their own good, the private eye insists on being true to a higher impulse. Ultimately, Marlowe is betrayed and finds his code to be futile. To accentuate his deviation from the genre, Altman brilliantly chose Elliott Gould to portray Marlowe. Gould's Marlowe is a diSheveled, shambling character working his way Utrough Ute mystery wiUt a steady supply of Camels. In The Maltese Falcon, Noel Cairo (Peter Lorre) complains about Sam Spade's (Humphrey Bogart) acid wisecracking. Spade replies, \"What do you want me to do, learn how to stutter?\" Gould's Marlowe mumbles his way along. This Marlowe couldn't ad-lib his way out of a paper bag. His smart remarks bring only scorn. Altman's brilliance in casting extends Utroughout Ute com\u00ad pany. Sterling Hayden Is ex\u00ad cellent as the washed-up writer In the agonies of Ute O.T.'s. Mark Rydell Is marvelous as the sinister gangster who smashes his mistress' face just to make a point. Altman makes effective use of several cinematic ploys in the film. In contrast to Ute genre, with its use of high contrast visuals to underscore the poles of good and bad, The Long Good bye uses even lighting to highlight the one~ensional moral environment surroun\u00ad ding Gould. Even nighttime action is abundantly iUuminated, with the city taking on 1\\ bright aura. Several times the camera shows reflected images. Marlowe sees a woman in the distorted renection of a picture frame. Two characters talk while the window In front of them reflects Marlowe waiting outside. This technique rein\u00ad forces the distorted, reversed nature of the world Marlowe acts in. WEDNESDAY FEI1AUAAV I'th TWO SHOWS ,.

By RON GIVENS Staff Writer From now on the only way Iowa Citians will be able to get an organic meal will be to cook it themselves . On Jan. 31, the Stone Soup restaurant, located in Center East, stopped serving after running up a debt of almost $5,000. \"We're closed,\" said Pres Brawner, one of eight staff people who ran Stone Soup. \"We're cleaning up and liquida ting. \" Stone Soup was a non-profit organization, part of the New Pioneer Collective Society, which includes the New Pioneer Food Store and the Morning Glory Bakery. Lila Bailey, accountan t for the collective, said Stone Soup equipment will be sold to cover some of the debt and the rest will be covered by the collec\u00ad tive. \"Creditors will be paid,\" Bailey said. \"We will not go into bankruptcy. \" Bailey said Stone Soup's financial problems began a year ago, when the Morning Glory Bakery quit sharing Stone Soup's Center East space. \"When the bakery moved it hurt Stone Soup,\" Bailey said. \"They had to pay all the utility costs, and they were con\u00ad siderable. \" The bakery operated from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., when Stone Soup was not open. \"The bakery people got burned out doing all their work during those hours,\" Bailey said. \"And the demand (or their products escalated so they couldn't get all their work done.\" Brawner said deficits have been accumulating gradually. \"Each month has been a little more,\" he said. \"It's gone on for so long that we lost a lot of money.\" Bailey said part of Stone Soup's problem was a lack of s\\lphistication in business practices . She said the restaurant operated sometimes with too large an inventory and with some waste. \"They were most concerned with creating a utopian at\u00ad mosphere,\" she said, \"and the world just ish't ready for that. They were 100 years ahead of their time.\" Brawner said there was a good rapport among the staff, calling them \"tight-knit, con\u00ad tent folks.\" He said the business affairs of Stone Soup were run by consensus. \"At one time Stone Soup was run by one person who did all the business -ordering, taxes, check writing, pick-ups and delivery -and the job rotated from one person to another. But that wasn't considered healthy. We changed to running things by consensus last October. Lately, we were just getting to the point where we knew what was needed and what quan\u00ad tities.\" Brawner said several things were done in an attempt to turn Stone Soup around. \"We tried everything. We did have a lot of good, inexpensive food, then we got more fancy and increased the menu. We also redecorated Ute place and did some painting. think the community will miss us,\" Brawner said. Brawner said there will be a Stone Soup benefit at 7 p.m. today. \"There'll be a pot luck and we'll be accepting donations,\" he said. \"People will be bringing musical in\u00ad struments. We'll all play and eat and dance together for one last time.\" But we didn't have enough e e e e e people coming in.\" e e Bailey said she didn't think e e the closing of Stone Soup in-e Bu rgers are dicated a decline of interest In e vegetarian food. e Best at Bull \"People are becoming more e interested in this kind of food,\" e she said. \"The bakery demand : M kt. : is fantastic.

Comple~ly re-Photo Il\u00a5 John DIIli<:k: Jr. stored, the 11th century bome of a wealthy bum manufacturer now offers refreshments to members of all classes In ils parlors. Bartok, Rachmaninoff synthesized DUBUQUE -In place of synthetic lamps plastered with beer logos, the Redstone bar In Dubuque has opulent antique light fixtures hanging from an ornately decorated ceiling. Rather than a pool table, a fireplace dominates each room. The tavern has waist-high oak trim Instead of pressed wood paneling and has original oil paintings on the walls. Situated on the first two floors of a magnificent Victorian mansion near downtown Dubuque, the Redstone is one of Iowa's unique bars. The building itself was erected out of striking red stone and sports a tower, lavish picture win\u00ad dows, an enormous porch, acres of stained glass, and columns In front. ~t the entrance is a spacious foyer with a handsome stair\u00ad case winding its way up to cozy former bedrooms furnished with hanging plants, tables and wooden ice cream chairs. On each side of the foyer are parlors, one of which has been converted into a bar and another that offers more seating. Despite the Redstone's luxurious setting, a draught beer can be had for less than in most Iowa City bars -50 cents. Bartender Patrick Tulley explained that the Redstone was built by Dubuque's wealthiest citizen in the 1880s with stone brought from Georgia. \"The house was built by a guy named A. A. Cooper, who was a buggy manufacturer and owned the largest company In town. It covered 22 acres of down town Dubuque. \"The thing about Cooper wagons was that they aged their wood for seven years. It was a prestigious wagon, and they exported it all over the world,\" Tulley said. Cooper is a bit of a local legend, and they still tell stories abuut him around town. He started as a meager blacksmith but eventually built an in-dustrial concern that produced sleds, bicycles and buggies as wen as wagons; in the early years of the century the com\u00ad pany employed 1,200 of Dubuque's 12,000 residents. The Studebaker company wanted to merge with Cooper and begin to produce cars in Dubuque, but Cooper considered the automobile a passing fad and refused the offer. \"This house was built for Cooper's unmarried daughter,\" Tulley said, \"and he lived across the street in a larger version of this house, called the Greystone, where the post office parking lot is now. It was massacred 15 years ago.\" Studebaker and the other auto corporations finally got revenge on the soggy old buggy baron when his 35-room home -with Its ballroom and solid bronze elevator -was demolished so that their products could be parked in what was once his lawn. Three years ago the same fate awaited the Redstone. The building had remained a private residence until the early '70s, when it was first converted into a bar. The original bar - named the Gallery -met financial woes, and by 1975 the mansion had sat empty for nearly a year. It was then tha t the Post Office officials decided they needed even more parking space. But a group of local citizens hustled to get the home placed on the National Register of Historical Sites, thereby creating the ironic situation where the Redstone was being protected from the federa I government by the federal government . After saving the building, a few of the citizens set to work restoring it. After four months of labor, most of it voluntfler, the Redstone bar opened on Sept. 3, 1975. Since that day, \"everyone from doctors and lawyers all the way to garbagemen\" have frequented the bar, according to Tulley. But the most notable of the Redstone's patrons was probably Sylvester Stallone. \"When the movie (F.l.S.T.J was here,\" Tulley said, \"this was the hangout for Stallone and the crew.\" Describing Stallone as with\u00ad drawn, Tulley said, \"People thought he was egotistical, but he was just uptight about the movie and his performance. You wouldn't believe it, but he'd walk out on the street and people would scream. And when he came in here il was jam\u00ad med.\" Although always an en\u00ad thusiastic advocate of the Redstone, Pat Tulley gets a special gleam in his eye when listing another of the bar's attributes. \"We got the best looking waitresses in town.

Works differ, out of a chord By JUDITH GREEN Staff Wnter The UI Symphony played works by Bartok and Rach\u00ad maninoff Wednesday night in Hancher, and it is interesting that conductor James Dixon elected to juxtapose this par\u00ad ticular pair. Twentieth century composers fall (roughly speaking) into two camps: those who choose to deal with and develop traditional elements and forms, and those who utterly reject any vestiges of the pas t. In the former, and by far the larger and more comprehensible category, Bartok and Rachmaninoff stand, Janus-llke, representing two divergent directions of compositional technique. Rachmaninoff, his roots solidly in the 19th century Romantic virtuoso tradition, wrote workslhallook backward to a comfortably conventional past, a time in which music, if it adhered to stabllshed prin\u00ad ciples, was guaranteed an appreciative audJence. Bartok, In contrast, was able 10 synthesize traditional elements primitive Hungarian folk tunes, Baroque counterpoint , classical forms, cyclical unity, and brilliant orchestrational techniques - into bold new musical ideas that go beyond the sum of their parts In breaking new ground. \"Music for Strings, Per\u00ad cussion, and Celesta\" (1937) bridges the gap between the calculated rhythmic brutality and percussiveness of Bartok's middle period and the serene exploration of harmony in his final years. The work combines elements from both styles with such craftsmans hip that it sounds neither uneven nor unbalanced . The orchestra was arranged according to Bartok's stage directions, divided strings flanking the central percussion section, emphasizing the an\u00ad tiphonal possibilities as sections imitate or answer one another. The work received a for\u00ad thright, if not wildly inspired, reading. I liked the slow un\u00ad folding of the first movement's fugal exposition, its flowing, spun-out quality as it carefully builds to Its cllmax, then recedes from It. The scherzo bogged down a liltle In its TONIGHT AND SATURDAY Louise Dimiceli The Brian Harmon Trio 6 to 10 pm $1 cOVer Music development section; the tempo, which I thought too much on the safe side throughout, here lost all sense of forward impulsion and plodded grittily along for several long minutes. The slow movement , a perfect example of Bartok's \"night sounds,\" was so carefully planned, indeed so metric, that one received little sense of the spaciousness necessary in letting the music breathe. In both these movements the piano was frequently far out of balance, Its sound too strident and brittle for the context. The finale, its rhythm half Bulgarian and half classical jazz, was played nicely. Especially lovely was the richly harmonized restatement of the fugue sub\u00ad ject, a vivid contrast to its austere presentation at the work's opening. Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto in D minor is, if not the most difficult work In the genre, at least among the top con-tenders. The score, which resembles an anthill that has been stepped upon, is literally black with thousands of notes. It was written by one of history's greatest piano virtuosos to challenge his own technique, and its demands are colossal. Pianist John Simms has the technique to tear Into the fist\u00ad fuls of notes and the musicianship to make their mastering seem worthwhile. One of my teachers used to describe music as forever suspended between inevitability and surprise; the performer must feel and express to the audience that every note logically unfolds from its predecessor and yet, paradoxically , is as fresh and e~citing as if heard for the first time. SImm's playing has that quality, particularly in the introspective passages. From where 1 sat, however (first balcuny), there was a definite balance problem, which was not at all the fault of the pianist. The orchestra was too big, and it covered him more than once, partlcular'y In the first movement.

The University of Illinois will be defending its title for the third consecutive year. However, the lllini suffered a major loss when their top two gymnasts, Patty Carmichael and ex'()lympian Nancy Thies, decided not to compete this year. Michigan State, last year's second-place finisher in the Big Ten meet was ranked 12th in preseason polls, and the Spartans' only loss this year was to top-ranked Penn State. The Spartans are the favorite In the attempt to dethrone the Dlini. The other squads that are competing this weekend and the order they finished In last year's tournament are: Wisconsin (third) i Minnesota (fourth); Michigan (fifth); Iowa (sixth); Indiana (sAvAnth): and Ohio State (eighth). Northwestern and Purude do not compete in gymnastics. Iowa Coach Tepa Haronoja said that the evenness of the performances on every event will be the key to the Hawkeyes success. \"We can't afford to emphasize one event or another,\" Haronoia explained. Haronoia also added that the team has qualified for nationals by obtaining an average score of 118.00 in five meets. -Higher seedings for the regional competition may also be earned with top scores this weekend, she added. Haronoja said she Is pleased with the Iowa team's pick in the order for routines. \"We are placed before Michigan State, and that will help us a lot.

Although only two meets remain on the 1977-78 schedule, including a dual meet at South Dakota State and the state meet at Des Moines, Nielsen has told Coach Tepa Haronoia that she will end her career Sa turday because of recurring knee injuries. The knee injuries have plagued Nielsen throughout her gymnastics career, including this, her third season at Iowa. Nielsen has been a leading scorer for the Hawkeyes this season, and has also competed in regional competition during her sophomore and junior seasons. With vaulting and uneven parallel bars as her strengths, Nielsen averaged 31.75 in all-around competition last season. In last season's state meet, she finished third in all-around ; second on bars and fifth in vaulting. Nielsen was also a Big Ten performer last season. . Conference battles test No.7 Wildcats LEXINGTON, Ky. (UPI) - Kentucky Coach Joe Hall labels his top ranked team's next five games as important tests to see what type of condition his squad is in for the NCAA postseason tournament. The Wildca ts play five games in 10 days and Hall likened that type of schedule to the kind Kentucky would face if it gets into the NCAA tournament. \"When you've got a whole lot of games in a short period of time like this, it tells you if your squad is in condition at the end of the season,\" Hall said. \"It's going to be like the NCAA and should tell us a Jot about our team.\" Kentucky begins the rough part of the schedule Saturday at UiU, then travels to MiSSissippi on Monday night. Wednesday night, it returns home for its makeup game with Tennessee, followed by a weekend home stand against Southeastern Conference runnerup Mississippi State and Alabama, the lone team to defeat Ken\u00ad tucky in 18 games. Hall's team is comfortably atop the league standings with a 9-1 league mark and can practically wrap up the title with a win at UiU, a team that has been playing excellent basketball since it was walloped on regional television at Ken\u00ad tucky last month. \"You can't judge how a team is going to react after we handled them pretty well in Lexington,\" Hall said. \"They've got some strong players and played us even in the second half of the first game.\" But the game was over for all purposes at halftime after Kentucky raced to a 55-27 first half lead in what was probably its finest 20 minu tes of basketball all season long. UiU Coach Dale Brown, who was critical of Kentucky 'S rough style of play and of some of the Wildcat fans after the loss, has his team in the race for second place honors and a possible berth in the NCAA tourney. were very lucky.\" Iowa has only competed against two of the Big Ten teams and ended up spliting the dual meets.

(UPI) -Fidgety Bill Rogers stood still long enough on a windswept day Thursday to shoot a 5-under-par 67 that gave hinl the lead after two rounds of the 9O-hole $22S,OOO Bob Hope Desert Classic. The 26-year-old Texan, who barely weighs 140 pounds wringing wet, withstood a strong desert wind to hold off late challenges by Tom Watson, Miller Barber, Lee Trevino and Arnold Palmer. Rogers had Seven birdies and two bogeys for his 67, shot at Bermuda Dunes, and it enabled him to hold a one-stroke lead over Watson, winner this year of the Tucson Open and Crosby, and Barber, who took the Phoenix Open title. Watson shot a 68 at tougher Eldorado while Barber had a 67 at La Quinta. Thus, after two rounds of the longest tournament played on the PGA Tour, Rogers had a 36- hole score of I'runder-par 136, while Watson and Barber were at 137. Lon Hinkle also had a 67 at Bermuda Dunes and Danny Edwards had a 67 at La Quinta to join Grier Jones, Bobby Walzel, Tom Purtzer, Woody Blackburn and Britain's Peter Oosterhuis at 138. other players -Trevino and Bill Calfee -also had 67s and that put them at 5-under 139 with Rex CaldweJl, Jerry McGee, Tom Shaw, first round leader David Graham and Palmer, who has won the Hope title five times but not once since 1973. PGA champion Lanny Wad\u00ad kins shot a 68 but was eight shots back at 142. U.S. Open champ Hubert Green, who won footer on the 9th. Then came his 15-foot birdie putt on the lOth and he foUowed that with a 5-foot birdie putt on the 11 th and a 3-f ooter on the 12th.

Ranked third in the nation before the contest, Iowa jumped out to a 20-6 lead and held off a desperate Oklahoma State raUy to move their dual meet record to 12-1 on the season, while the Cowboys dropped to 15-1. Hawkeye Coach Dan Gable caned the wins at 126 and 150 pounds, as weU as a draw at 158 (one of three on the night) the key matches leading to the Iowa win before a packed crowd of 7,000 Cowboy fans In GaUagher HaU. At 126 pounds, Iowa freshman Randy Lewis shocked Oklahoma State's Roger By ROGER THUROW Sports Editor \"It was one more point and a whole lot of jumping on people in the first half that won this game,\" a bitter Iowa Coach Lute Olson said after watclimg his team drop a white-knuckle, 71-70, decision to Michigan State Thursday night at the Field House. Somebody obviously forgot to tell the Iowa basketbaD team that the Spartans are supposed to be the 10th best team in the nation and the best in the Big Ten. And, according to Olson, somebody forgot to tell the three-man offiCiating crew that the game is supposed to be called the same way for both 'the first-place teams and the eighth-place teams. Not giving one inch to their prestigious opponent, the Hawkeyes battled back from a seven-point deficit with 90 seconds remaining in the game, only to fall one point short at the buzzer. Although Iowa wasn't in awe of Michigan State, Olson said it was intimidation -more than any jump shot or turnover - that kept victory away from his team. \"Our kids got cheated. The referees showed a total lack of courage. The crew's lack of maintaining one standard for both sides was the key factor. And it irrita tes me to no end,\" Olson charged in a brief, but stern, post-game press con\u00ad ference. \"The officials used two standards out there: one for the first division team and one for the second division team.\" Olson's tirade was directed at the loud arm-waving antics of Michigan State Coach Jud Heathcote, who ran up and down the sidelines in pursuit of the referees during an emoUonal first half. Roberts, ranked second In the naUon at 134, building up a 10-3 lead before ending their match at the 6: 11 mark with a pin off the cradle. Lewis' pin gave the Hawkeyes an 8-2 lead after Iowa's Dan Glenn and Oklahoma State's Kevin Nellis battled to a 2-2 draw at 118 pounds, In which Glenn fell just three seconds short of winning the match on riding time advantage. In other key matches, Bruce Kinseth traded escapes for takedowns against the Cowboys' Bruce Randall for a 19-7 super superior decision that gave Iowa an 18-4 lead, while' Iowa senior Mike McGivern fought Oklahoma State fresh\u00ad man sensation Dave Schultz to a 5-S draw at 158. The pair entered the third period deadlocked at 3- 3, then traded reversals, with McGivern's 29-second riding time advantage short of breaking the tie. the calls for the seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th place teams just like they do for the first division teams. \"The rules in this conference have been changed to prevent a coach from getting off the chair and screaming,\" Olson con\u00ad tinued. \"I expect to have a conversation with the Big Ten nfficials over this tomorrow, and we'll have more of them until this is straightened out.\" After harassing the officials throughout the first half and incurring the wrath of the 12,125 screaming fans, Heathcote was finally slapped with a technical foul five minutes into the second half. \"The way the game was going, both of us coaches probably should have had one. But I think the referees were embarrassed by some of the calls they had made,\" Heath\u00ad cote said. \"If I got all the technicals I deserved, they'd be That made the score 2~ before the Cowboys made their last gasp wIth wins at 167 and '177 pounds. In perhaps the feature match of the night, pitting the two top\u00ad ranked 167-pounders In the nation, Oklahoma State's No.1 Paul Martin held off a flurry of takedown attempts by Iowa's Mike DeAnna in the final seconds to take a 5-3 decision. The win kept Martin undefeated for the season while DeAnna's record dropped to 23-2-2. The Cowboys' Eric Wais, down from 190 pounds, then brought the Cowboys to within striking distance at 20-12 with an 8-4 decision of Iowa senior Greg Stevens. Iowa co-captain Bud Palmer then stopped OSU dead in its tracks as he picked up three penalty pounts en route to a 6-2 decision over Darrell Monasmith to clinch the meet. To close the meet in yet on the free throw line aU night.\" \"He (Heathcote) was really raging. He was frantic and raving,\" said Hawkeye center Larry Olsthoorn, who fouled out of the game with 13: 17 left. Big Ten Mich.
