Acupuncture helps the body with its natural healing process, but is not intended to \"cure\". Acupuncture may help relieve a number of common conditions, including chronic pain, arthritis, anxiety, digestive issues, headache, nausea, cancer treatment side effects, and more. Patients who undergo acupuncture may also find emotional and spiritual healing. Our acupuncture team works to assist each individual with getting to a better place in their healing journey, whatever that looks like for each person. How Does Acupuncture Work? Acupuncture is the practice of placing needles in specific places on the body. These places, known as acupuncture points, coincide with different channels or meridians that run throughout the body. It is believed that the electrical impulse created when placing needles can help with the flow of energy through these meridians and, in turn, help the body deal with different issues. First, the acupuncturist will do a body assessment to determine what can be addressed. An acupuncturist will never diagnose a medical condition. Treatment begins by placing 10-20 needles on acupuncture points on the body that are chosen based on areas that need support. Once needles are placed, they stay in for 24 minutes, the time it takes for energy to completely circulate through the body.
