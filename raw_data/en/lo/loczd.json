Uniquely combining specific yin yoga asanas, with the corresponding ear acupuncture points to decompress the nervous system and stimulate primary meridians (energetic highways in the body). Expect delightful aromas of organic essential oils Ylang Leanne Botanicals , herbals, and harmonious instrumentals to facilitate a even deeper state of relaxation. A beautiful journey of surrendering, letting go and coming back home to yourself. A combination of Yin Yoga and Acupuncture Yin yoga Yin Yoga is a slow-paced style of yoga as exercise, incorporating principles of traditional Chinese medicine, with asanas (postures) that are held for longer periods of time than in other styles. Its focus is increasing pain-free range of motion, healing injuries, calming the mind and nervous system. Auricular acupuncture Auricular acupuncture is the go-to wellness routine to reduce stress, anxiety and general well-being. The ear acts like a switchboard to the brain. The external ear connects through the microsystem reflexes to every part of the body, allowing a wide variety of health and psychological problems to be relieved. Think about reflexology, but on ears. Vagus Nerve Activity Auricular Acupuncture has also been found to stimulate Vagus nerve activity. The Vagus nerve is the main component of the parasympathetic pathway aka rest and digest. Needles vs. Seeds and Magnets The needles are hair-thin even smaller than those used for body acupuncture. Typically, most people feel no pain at all. The needles remain in the ear for the duration of the acupuncture treatment. Ear seeds and magnets are completely painless and non-invasive. These tiny, stick-on seeds come in the form of actual seeds or gold plated magnets. They stick on and can be kept on the ear for a few days, as they continue to work. About Chareldi (Yoga Teacher) I was introduced to Yoga while studying and experienced a beautiful nostalgic moment from my childhood. It was then that I knew my dream was to one day teach yoga and healing processes through various modalities. I finally completed my 200h YTT course in VINYASA & YIN Yoga in 2019. There are very few things in life as powerful as self-love, self-care and exploring and delving deep within the wellbeing of your Physical, Emotional, Mental, Energetic and Spiritual body. A complete balance of Mind, Body & Soul. Through these life-changing transformations and deep inner work my Soul found its purpose in Yoga, Sound Healing, Energy Work & finally the beautiful plant medicine IxCacoa. I now host Yoga, IxCacoa & Sound Healing Ceremonies, Retreats and Workshops. Giving you the opportunity to re-connect to your heart space, explore the depths of your being, re-align your energies and ignite every particle of your existence, as you take on a soul journey. There is something so rewarding to gifting yourself time to discover your true essence, and allow your body's movement and breath to guide you, as you flow through your day on or off your mat. About Leanne (Acupuncture & Integrated Trauma Healing) I have a borderline obsession with plant medicine and natural therapies, and maybe some good wine. I'm a Certified Integrated Healing Practitioner, Acupuncture Detox Specialist and currently studying Facial Acupuncture. I also have certifications, among others, in Advanced Kinesiology, Iridology, Trauma Release, Brain Integration and Aromatherapy. After qualifying as a Chartered Accountant balancing books evolved to balancing bodies. I followed my wanderlust and dream, and moved to the East. After living in Bali for 4 years and travelling through Asia and the USA, I developed an Organic Essential Oils and Herbal range that works in conjunction with the body's natural healing processes. Stress and anxiety has been a personal journey, and I believe it is NOT an obstacle but an INVITATION!
