Welcome to our online booking site Chiropractic [Read More](2-description) Chiropractic is a non-invasive, hands-on health care discipline that focuses on the musculoskeletal system. Chiropractors practice a manual, hands on approach to muscular dysfunction, pain and injury by providing a diagnosis after a comprehensive evaluation. Treatment and preventive care for disorders related to the spine, pelvis, nervous system and joints is then recommended and may include referrals to other healthcare disciplines including but not limited to primary care physicians (family doctors), physiotherapists, dieticians etc. or modification of activity and even referral for additional imaging studies to be completed (Xrays, CT scans, MRI, diagnostic ultrasounds etc.). Dr. Kivisto will work with your other health care providers to enhance your treatment when necessary. Chiropractors use a combination of treatments, all of which are predicated on the specific needs of the individual patient. For many conditions, such as lower back pain, chiropractic care is frequently the primary method of treatment. Where other conditions exist, chiropractic care may complement or support medical treatment by relieving the musculoskeletal aspects associated with the condition. Chiropractic care may also be used to provide symptomatic relief for patients with chronic conditions. According to patient surveys, by treating the musculoskeletal elements of such disorders, chiropractic treatment has been shown to improve the general well-being of the patient. Fascial Stretch Therapy [Read More](13-description) Fascial stretch therapy helps deal with mobility and chronic pain issues. It is a relatively new form of treatment that involves the therapist performing assisted stretching techniques with a client on a treatment table or floor. Comfortable straps help stabilize the limb or part of the body that is not being stretched in order to facilitate complete relaxation and to enhance the effectiveness of the stretches.
