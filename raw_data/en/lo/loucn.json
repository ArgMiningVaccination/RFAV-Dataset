Published Online 27 March 2008 Background For protection against (re-)infection by influenza virus not only the magnitude of the immune response but also itsquality in terms of antibody subclass and T helper prole is important. Information about the type of immune response elicited by vaccination is therefore urgently needed. Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate in detail the immune response elicited by three current influenza vaccineformulations and to shed light on vaccine characteristics which determine this response. Methods Mice were immunized with whole inactivated virus (WIV), virosomes (VS) or subunit vaccine (SU). Followingsubsequent infection with live virus, serum antibody titers and Th cell responses were measured. The effects of the vaccines on cytokine production by conventional and plasmacytoid dendriticcells were investigated in vitro .Results and conclusions In Balb c mice (Th2 prone) as well as in C57Bl 6 mice (Th1 prone), WIV induced consistently higher hemagglutination-inhibition titers and virus-neutralizing antibody titers than VS or SU. In contrast to VS and SU, WIV stimulated the production of the antibody subclasses IgG2a (Balb c) and IgG2c (C57BL 6), considered to be particularly important for viral clearance, and activation of IFN- c-producing T cells. Similar to live virus, WIV stimulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines by conventional dendritic cells and IFN- aby plasmacytoid cells, while VS and SU had little effect on cytokine synthesis by either cell type. We conclude that vaccination with WIV in contrast to VS or SU results in the desired Th1 responsepresumably by induction of type I interferon and other cytokines.

Introduction Influenza remains one of the major infectious diseases with three to ve million severe cases of illness and 250-500 000deaths per year in industrialized countries only accordingto estimates of the World Health Organization. 1Next to the yearly epidemics, there is the eminent threat of a new influenza pandemic with an estimated attack rate of 10-30% and possibly a very high death toll. 2,3Vaccination has been and will be the cornerstone of influenza control inepidemic and pandemic situations. Among the available vaccine formulations split and sub- unit vaccines are most frequently used for immunizationagainst the yearly influenza epidemics. 4Split vaccines con- sist of inactivated virus particles which are disrupted by treatment with detergent and or ether. Subunit vaccines (SU) consist of the viral surface antigens puried fromdetergent-disrupted virus particles. Virosomal vaccines (VS) which have been introduced on the market recentlyare reconstituted viral membranes consisting of the viralsurface antigens inserted in a lipid bilayer thus mimickingthe viral envelope. 5,6In the early years of influenza vaccina- tion, whole inactivated virus (WIV) has also been used as influenza vaccine. However, the use of WIV vaccines was largely abandoned due to a higher incidence of side effectswhen compared with the other formulations. Recently,WIV has regained interest in the context of pandemic vac-cine development as a simple and highly immunogenic vac-cine formulation. Reactogenicity of modern WIV appearsto be comparable with other vaccine formulations possiblydue to improved methods for virus production and purication. 7-11 For the evaluation of vaccine efcacy, the serum glutination-inhibition (HI) titer achieved by vaccination DOI:10.1111/j.1750-2659.2008.00038.x www.blackwellpublishing.com/influenzaOriginal Article \u00aa2008 The Authors Journal Compilation \u00aa2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses ,2, 41-51 41currently used as the only correlate of protection. An HI titer of 40 is estimated to be associated with a 50% reduc-tion in the risk of contracting influenza and is used as thebasis for the EMEA criteria to which influenza vaccineshave to comply. 4This 50% protective titer was calculated from a number of clinical studies in which immunity was achieved by either natural infection or by vaccination withinactivated or live-attenuated influenza vaccines. As infec-tion as well as vaccination will induce a plethora ofimmune reactions, it is unclear whether HI antibodiesthemselves provide protection or whether their presence issimply an indication of the immune status to influenzavirus. 12 Recent evidence suggests that in addition to the magni- tude of the immune reaction also the quality of theimmune response is important for protection. The anti-body response to natural infection by influenza virus andother viruses in mice is dominated by IgG2a (or inC57BL 6 mice IgG2c). 13-16By virtue domain, murine IgG2a and activatory Fc receptors.17-19Thereby, IgG2a 2c contributes to viral clearance by activation of the comple- ment system, stimulation of antibody-dependent cellularcytotoxicity and clearance of opsonized virus by macro-phages. 16,20,21By contrast, IgG1 does neither activate com- plement efciently nor has it a high afnity for activatoryFc receptors. 18,19Recently, it was shown that IgG2a alone protects mice as efciently from lethal challenge as a mix-ture of IgG1 and IgG2a. By contrast, IgG1 alone only pro- tects from mild virus challenge but provides insufcient protection upon high dose challenge. 22 The relative contribution of Th1 and Th2 cell-mediated effector mechanisms to protection from influenza virus-induced lung damage and to virus clearance is still underinvestigation. T helper cell responses to influenza infectioninvolve IFN- c-producing Th1 cells as well as IL4-producing but Th1 responses are strongly dominant. 23Evi- dence is accumulating that Th1 cells are superior to Th2 cells in providing protection against viral infection and doso by secretion of IFN- cand by stimulation of B cells and CD8 +T cells but also by direct perforin-dependent cyto- lysis.24-29On the other hand, Th2 cells are necessary to prevent excessive lung inflammation caused by an over-whelming Th1 response. 27In the absence of antibodies, T helper cells can provide a certain degree of cross-protective immunity possibly by secretion of IFN- cwhich activates by direct cytolysis of infected cells.25,26,29 As epitopes recognized by T helper cells are more con-served than those recognized by antibodies, vaccine-induced T helper responses might contribute decisively tothe cross-protective potential of influenza vaccines. 29 To shed more light on the quality of the immune response to different influenza vaccine formulations, weimmunized mice with WIV, VS or SU vaccines and mea- sured the induced HI titers, virus-neutralizing antibodytiters, virus-specic IgG1 and IgG2a 2c by enumeration of IFN- cand IL4-pro- ducing T helper cells. As the genetic background of mice is known to have a large effect on the immune response, the vaccination experiments were performed in Th1-proneC57BL 6 mice as well as in Th2-prone Balb c mice. To gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the differ-ential reactions to the vaccines, we studied the effect of thevaccine formulations on conventional and plasmacytoiddendritic cells in vitro . These cell types are considered as the most important switches between the innate and the adaptive immune system and are essential for the induction and control of specic immune responses. Our results showthat in contrast to VS and SU vaccine, WIV induces astrong immune response qualitatively resembling theresponse obtained after virus infection irrespective of thegenetic background of the recipient. The immune responseto the vaccines in vivo is likely to be related to their capa- bility to induce the production of proinflammatory conventional DCs and IFN- and methods Mice Ten- to 12-week-old female Balb c mice or C57BL 6 mice, purchased from Harlan Netherlands B.V. (Zeist, the Neth- erlands), were used for the immunization study or alterna- tively for isolation of spleen cells and bone marrow cellsforin vitro stimulation experiments. Animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines provided bythe Dutch Animal Protection Act, and were approved bythe Committee for Animal Experimentation (DEC) of theUniversity of Groningen. Virus and vaccines Egg-derived A Panama 2007 99 (H3N2) virus and sub- unit vaccine produced from this strain were a kind giftfrom Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Weesp, the Netherlands.WIV vaccine was produced by inactivation of virus with0\u00c61%b-propiolactone (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) for 24 hours at followed by dialysis and ltration (0 \u00c645lm).

Immunizations and infection Mice were infected intranasally with 150 hemagglutination units (HAU) live A Panama virus or were intramuscularly immunized in the hind leg with 30 ll of the different vac- cine formulations each containing 5 lg of viral hemaggluti- nin protein (HA) in HNE buffer or received buffer only.After 28 days, serum samples were collected prior to anintranasal boost with 150 HAU live influenza virus in 10 ll divided over both nostrils. Three days hereafter mice werebled to death and spleens were collected for T helper cell evaluation. Hemagglutination-inhibition assay A standard HAI assay was performed. In short, 75 llo f serum was inactivated at 56 /C176C for 30 minutes and absorbed to 225 ll of 25% kaolin PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St Louis, MO, USA) solution for 20 minutes at room temper-ature (RT). After centrifugation, 50 ll of supernatant was added to 50 ll of PBS in duplicate in a round-bottom microtiter plate (Costar; Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA)followed by two-fold serial dilutions. Four hemagglutina-tion units (HAU) of virus in 50 ll of PBS were added to each well and the mixtures were incubated for 40 minutesat RT. Finally, 50 ll of 1% guinea pig erythrocytes (Har- lan) in PBS was added to each well and HAI titers weredetermined after 2 hours incubation at RT. HAI titers rep- resent the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution yielding complete inhibition of hemagglutination. HAI titers belowthe detection limit were assigned serum dilution. of (serum-free) cell were incubated with an equal volume containing6\u00c625 TCID50 virus, at 37 /C176C for 2 hours before 100 llo f this mix was added to Maden Darby canine kidney(MDCK) cell monolayers in a microtiter plate (Costar;Corning Inc.). After overnight incubation in a humidiedCO 2incubator at 37 /C176C, cells were xed with 80% acetone in PBS and the amount of intracellularly produced viral nucleoprotein (NP) was determined by an ELISA. Blocking was performed with 150 ll of 4% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0\u00c605% Tween 20 PBS (PBS T), 45 minutes at RT, followed by washing with PBS T. Subsequently, 100 ll of anti-NP monoclonal 20PBS, was added for 1 hour at RT, followed by washing.

Absorbance at 492 nm (A 492) was measured with an ments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). VN titers were reciprocal of the highest dilution yielding an averageA 492above the end-point value resulting from the equation: [(average A492of the positive controls (infected cells) minus average A492of the negative controls (non-infected cells)) divided by 2] plus the average A492of the negative controls. Isotype ELISA For detection of virus-specic serum antibodies of different isotypes, microtiter plates (Greiner, Alphen a d Rijn, the Netherlands) were coated with 0 \u00c62lg of influenza subunit vaccine in 100 llo f0 \u00c605 M carbonate-bicarbonate coating buffer (pH 9 \u00c66-9 \u00c68) per well, overnight at 37 /C176C, followed by blocking with 2% milk in coating buffer for 45 minutes at 37 /C176C. After washing with coating buffer and 0 \u00c605% Tween 20 PBS (PBS T), 100 ll of serum diluted in PBS T was applied in duplicate to the rst well and serial twofolddilutions were made. A subsequent incubation for1\u00c65 hours at 37 /C176C was followed by washing and incubation with 100 ll of horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti- mouse IgG-isotype antibody (Southern Biotech) for 1 hour at 37 /C176C. Plates were washed and stained with OPD (East- man Kodak Company). Absorbance at 492 nm ( A 492) was read with an ELISA (Bio-tek Instruments, Inc.).After subtraction of background levels, serum antibodyconcentrations were calculated by means of appropriate is-otype standards (Southern Biotech) using linear regression.

Culture supernatants were collected and subjected to the IFN- aELISA. IFN- aELISA Twofold serial dilutions of culture supernatants, starting from a fourfold primary dilution, were subjected in dupli-cate to an IFN- aELISA previously described by Lund et al. , 34except that the staining was performed with OPD (Eastman Company) and absorbance was read at492 nm. IFN- aconcentrations were calculated in quadru- plicate (HyCult, Biotechnology, Uden, the Netherlands)using a linear regression, and expressed in units per ml. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis on antibody titers was performed usingthe considered statistically signicant or highly signicant respectively. Results To elucidate the effect of vaccine formulation on the mag- nitude and the quality of the elicited immune response,mice were immunized once with 5 lg of HA derived from APanama 2007 99 (H3N2) virus formulated as WIV, VS or SU vaccine. Serum samples were taken 4 weeks after immunization and the hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI)and virus-neutralizing (VN) capacity of the sera was deter-mined ( Table 1). In Balb c mice, all three vaccines induced Table 1. Hemagglutination-inhibition titers and virus-neutralization titers after a single immunization 16 <80 Mice were immunized once i.m. with buffer only (HNE) or with 5lg of HA formulated as WIV, VS or SU. On day 28, serum sam- ples were taken. For HAI determination, serum samples were pooled per group ( n= 9). For determination of VN titers, sera from individ- ual mice were tested.

Statistically signicant differences (P<0 \u00c601) are as indicated: ** compared with VS, SU or HNE, *compared with HNE.Geeraedts et al. \u00aa2008 The Authors 44 Journal Compilation \u00aa2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses ,2, 41-51HAI titers >40, with WIV producing the highest responses. In C57BL 6 mice, HAI titers after immunization with WIV were similarly high as in Balb c mice but were low (<40) after immunization with VS or SU. The neutralizing activi-ties of the sera correlated with the HAI titers. In both mouse strains, they were the highest after WIV immuniza- tion. Immunization with VS or SU vaccine induced mea-surable virus-neutralizing activity in Balb c mice, whereas this activity was under the detection limit of 80 inC57BL 6 mice. Twenty-eight days after immunization, the mice were infected intranasally with live A Panama virus and early memory responses were determined 3 days later. Infection with A Panama virus does not lead to symptomatic disease in mice, but induces nevertheless humoral and cellularimmune responses. Intranasal administration of liveAPanama virus boosted the vaccine-induced HAI and VN titers in either mouse strain ( Figure 1). In Balb c mice immunization with all three vaccines resulted in high HAItiters and VN titers after virus exposure (Figure 1, left pan-els). Yet, titers in WIV-immunized mice were higher than in VS- and SU-immunized animals. These differences were statistically signicant titers between as well as WIV and SU ( P<0 \u00c601). In C57BL 6 mice, only WIV induced consistently high HAI and VN titers in all immunized mice, whereas VS or SUresulted in measurable HAI and VN titers in only some ofthe immunized animals (Figure 1, panels). Differencesin titer between signicant ( P<0 \u00c601) in all cases. Taken together, these results show that WIV is more immuno-genic than VS or SU irrespective of the mouse strainstudied. The quality of the vaccine-induced immune response was investigated by determination of the IgG subclass pro-le and enumeration of IFN- c- and IL4-producing T helper cells. As a reference, we included in these studies mice thatwere immunized by exposure to live virus 28 days prior tovirus challenge. Determination of IgG subclasses byELISA revealed that Balb c mice which had earlier been exposed to live virus produced similar amounts of IgG1 and IgG2a. Immunization with WIV resulted in the pro- duction of substantial amounts of IgG2a but little IgG1( Figure 2). Production of antibodies in response to immu- nization with VS or SU vaccine was lower and the antibod-ies synthesized were almost exclusively of the IgG1subclass. C57BL 6 mice express the antibody subclass IgG2c instead of IgG2a. IgG2c was produced after exposureto live virus and especially after immunization with WIV, but was not induced by VS or SU. IgG1 responses to virus and WIV in C57BL 6 mice were similar to those in Balb c mice, while IgG1 responses to VS and SU were lower. To gain further insight into the quality of the immune response induced by the three different vaccines in relationto virus exposure, T helper responses were measured ( Fig- ure 3). After earlier virus exposure or immunization withWIV, Balb c mice as well as C57BL 6 mice generated large Figure 1. HAI titers and VN titers after immunization followed by virus challenge.

Three days later mice were killed. HAI titers and VN titerswere determined in individual sera asdescribed in Materials and methods. Results are given as log 2titers. The detection limit was 2 for HAI determination and 5 \u00c63 for VN between WIV and the other vaccine formulations are indicated by * and** respectively.Whole virus vaccine is superior to subunit vaccine \u00aa2008 The Authors Journal Compilation \u00aa2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses ,2, 41-51 45numbers of IFN- c-producing cells after challenge. IL4-pro- ducing cells were also detected, although in much lower amounts. By contrast, the T helper responses to VS and SUvaccine were either balanced or dominated by IL4-produc-ing cells. The number of IFN- c-producing cells in VS- or SU-immunized mice was signicantly lower than in WIV-immunized mice except for VS-immunized Balb mice (P<0 \u00c601 and Th2 cells respectively. We there- fore used the results of the ELISPOT assays to calculate ratios of Th1- and Th2-type cytokine-producing cells(Th1 Th2 ratios). Ratios were calculated for individual mice and the average and standard deviation were deter-mined per experimental group ( Figure 4). As was found for virus-exposed mice, the mean Th1 Th2 ratio was >>1 for all mice immunized with WIV with mean ratios of 2 \u00c668 for Balb c mice and 3 \u00c651 for C57BL 6 mice. By contrast, Th1Th2 ratios in VS- and SU-immunized mice were close to 1 or lower than 1 and in each of these experimentalgroups, a minority of the mice showed ratios >1. Taken Figure 3.

At least with respect to the T helper cells this response resembles that observed after exposure to live virus. By contrast, VS and SU vaccines induce Th2responses dominated by IgG1 and IL4. As dendritic cells (DCs) are important for the polariza- tion of Th cells into Th1 or Th2, the effect of the threevaccine formulations on conventional DCs andplasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in vitro . cDCs were generated from Balb c bone marrow cells by culture in the presence of GM-CSF for 10 days. When exposed to live virus or WIV these cells produced substantial amountsof the proinflammatory cytokines IL1 b, IL6 and TNF- a ( Figure 5). Exposure to VS also induced these cytokines, although to lower extents, while exposure to SU had littleor no effect on cytokine secretion. Active virus and WIValso induced the secretion of IL12, being known as a keyinducer of cellular immune responses. In contrast to the proinflammatory cytokines which were present early afterexposure, secretion of IL12 was retarded. Similarly, secre-tion of IL10, mainly involved in control of the immune response, was found at later time points after the start of the exposure. IFN- c, which is an important mediator of cellular immune responses and stimulates the productionof IgG2a was not secreted after exposure to either of thevaccines. This result is in line with an earlier study whichreports on in vitro production of IFN- cby bone marrow DCs cultured in GM-CSF + IL-15 but not DCs cultured inGM-CSF only as used here. 35 pDCs have been described as the major producers of type I interferon during virus infection.36A pDC-enriched cell population was prepared from splenocytes of na \u00a8ve Balb c mice and the cells were incubated with 0 \u00c601, 0 \u00c61, 1 or 10 lg of HA formulated as active virus or WIV, VS or SU vaccine respectively ( Figure 6A). Cells incubated with active virus or WIV produced substantial amounts of Figure 5. Cytokine production of conventional DCs upon exposure to virus or vaccines. Bone marrow cells were cultured for9 days with GM-CSF to obtain cDCs. On day9, cells were exposed to live influenza virus (closed circles), WIV (open circles), VS (closed triangles) or SU (open triangles) for theperiods indicated or were left untreated(black squares). Supernatants were harvested and cytokines were determined using Luminex technology. Results shown are themean of two independent experiments. Each supernatant was measured in duplicate.Whole virus vaccine is superior to subunit vaccine \u00aa2008 The Authors Journal Compilation \u00aa2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses ,2, 41-51 47IFN- a. These amounts peaked at a HA concentration of 0\u00c61lgml but were lower for lower as well as higher antigen doses. By contrast, pDCs incubated with VS or SUvaccine did not produce detectable amounts of IFN- aat any of the antigen concentrations used. IFN- aproduction in reaction to WIV was also observed in crude splenocytepreparations, but amounts increased signicantly uponpDC enrichment indicating pDCs as major Similar to spleen-derived pDCs from Balb c mice, pDCs derived from bone marrow of C57BL 6 mice by culture with Flt3 ligand produced IFN- aupon exposure to WIV but not to SU vaccine (Figure 6C). These data indicate that the differential reaction to the different vaccine formulations is independent of the source of thepDCs and the strain of mice. In conclusion, WIV is supe-rior to VS and SU in activating cDCs as well as pDCs toproduce cytokines that can modulate the extent and thephenotype of adaptive immune responses. Discussion In this paper, we show that, using the same amount ofHA, immunization of mice with WIV results in higher HAIand VN titers than immunization with VS or SU. More-over, the quality of the response to the vaccines differs pro-foundly. While WIV elicits a Th1 response reminiscent ofthat found after virus infection, VS and SU induce typicalTh2 responses. The observed differences in the amounts and subtypes of the induced antibodies and the phenotypes of the T-cell responses to the different vaccine formulationswere independent of antigen dose as revealed by dose-response studies using antigen amounts as low as 0 \u00c604lg (results not shown). The responses found in vivo reflectedthe effects of the vaccines on dendritic cells in vitro . Similar to active virus, WIV induced the synthesis of various cyto-kines by cDCs and stimulated the production of type Iinterferon by pDCs. By contrast, VS and SU had only mod- erate-to-low effects on DCs in vitro . Similar to the results obtained in the murine system reported here, higher HAI titers in response to WIV whencompared with the other formulations have also beenreported from human clinical trials especially when thestudy population was naive to the vaccine strain used. 7,37- 39The superior immunogenicity of WIV could be of great importance in a pandemic situation when protective immune responses against a new virus variant have to be achieved with a minimum amount of antigen. Evidence is accumulating that not only the magnitude of the immune response but also its quality is important forprotection. In the murine system, IgG2a was found recentlyto have a greater protective potential than IgG1 (see Ref.22; Bungener et al. , unpublished observations]. Moreover, Th1 cells can protect from lung damage while Th2 cells can be deleterious. 24,26-28These observations imply that the vaccine-induced immune response should ideally be of atype I phenotype. In the murine system, the present studyand studies of others show that only WIV but not split, VSor SU vaccine can induce the desired type I response. 40-43 In the human situation, the quality of the evoked immuneresponse has so far largely been neglected. HAI titers, andfor H5N1 trials VN titers, are usually the only correlates of protection measured in clinical studies. As vaccines can dif- fer profoundly in the type of response they evoke and asthis type can have important implications for protection,we strongly recommend including the determination ofimmune response quality in future clinical studies.A BC Figure 6. Production of IFN- aby plasmacytoid DCs after exposure to virus or vaccines. (A) Splenocytes derived from Balb c mice were enriched for pDCs as described in Materials and methods. Cells were incubated for 20 hours with the indicated amounts of HA using either live virus (lled circles), WIV (open circles), VS (lled triangles) or SU vaccine (open triangles). Supernatants were harvested and IFN- awas determined by a sandwich ELISA. Results of a representative experiment are shown.

DCs are consid- ered as the most important antigen-presenting cells and are the only cells that can activate naive T cells (for reviews, see Refs 44-46). Moreover, they are involved inthe polarization of naive T cells to a Th1 or Th2 pheno-type, respectively, and do so by the secretion of denedcytokines (for a review, see Ref. 47). We used bone mar-row cells cultured with GM-CSF to generate cDCs in vitro . Only when incubated with active virus or WIV, these cellsproduced substantial amounts of cytokines. These included IL12 which is considered as necessary to activate IFN- c production by Th1 cells. 35Virus and WIV also induced the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL1 b, IL6 and TNF- a. These cytokines found to be upregu- lated in human DCs incubated with live influenza virus.48 Notably, IL10 which is involved in the control of theimmune response and considered as a Th2 cytokine wasalso induced by virus and WIV, although at later time points as the proinflammatory cytokines. cDC-derived cytokines are very important for activating, directing andcontrolling adaptive immune responses. The higher andqualitatively different immune responses evoked by WIVwhen compared with the other vaccines might therefore -at least partly - be explained by stronger effects of WIV oncDCs. pDCs are less active in antigen presentation than cDCs. However, they are highly important in the innate defense of virus infections as they can produce large amounts oftype I interferons, particularly IFN- aupon exposure to virus. 36,49,50In our assays, pDCs exposed to active virus and WIV produced similar amounts of IFN- a, whereas nei- ther VS nor SU induced any IFN- asynthesis. Type I inter- ferons are major inducers of activation of immature DCsand lead to the upregulation of MHC molecules, chemo- kines, chemokine receptors and co-stimulatory molecules. 50 Moreover, they exert direct effects on B and T cells thus affecting antibody secretion and antibody class switching.51 Type I IFNs have been described as natural adjuvants.When added during immunization with influenza vaccine,type I IFN enhanced IgG1 but especially IgG2a responsesand signicantly improved survival of the mice after viruschallenge. 52We therefore consider it likely that IFN- a, pre- sumably produced by pDCs, upon immunization with WIV but not VS or SU vaccine is responsible for theenhanced immune response and the dominant Th1reaction. Together with studies of others comparing split vaccine with WIV, 41-43our current investigations allow interesting conclusions on the parameters which determine vaccineimmunogenicity. Split vaccine and WIV both contain allthe viral components yet they elicit very different immune responses indicating that not only vaccine composition butalso the physical structure of the vaccine (soluble versusparticulate) is important. On the other hand, virosomesand WIV sharing the particulate structure but differing in their composition also induce very different responses. From these results, we conclude that it is the combinationof vaccine components present and their physical organiza-tion which determines the immunological properties of avaccine. Interestingly, WIV and active virus elicited quanti-tatively and qualitatively similar responses indicating thatthe structural integrity of the virus particles is more impor-tant for the immune response than the presence or absence of virus replication. The exact mechanisms by which active virus and the vaccines induce the differential production ofDC cytokines are so far unclear. It is tempting to speculatethat stimulation of pathogen-associated molecular pattern(PAMP) receptors is involved. Elucidation of these mecha-nisms is highly interesting in the context of rational vaccinedevelopment and will be approached in a follow-up study. In conclusion, we showed that WIV vaccine induces a stronger and more Th1-skewed immune response than VS and SU vaccines most probably due to direct action of thevaccine on conventional as well as plasmacytoid DCs. Dueto its enhanced immunogenicity WIV can induce protectiveimmune responses at lower antigen doses. Moreover, thetype of the immune response elicited by WIV has provento provide better protection in animal models. We there-fore consider WIV as a highly attractive vaccine candidate especially in a pandemic situation.
