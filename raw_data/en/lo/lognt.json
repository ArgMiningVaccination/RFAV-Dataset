The warning was based on a single epidemiological study that found a sixfold increased risk, yet subsequent studies have found no association or a much more modest risk increase. A study involving 3.7 million pregnant women, published in JAMA [[1]](#fn_1) on 2 June 2015, showed that the risk of PPHN was modestly increased with maternal use of SSRI or non-SSRI antidepressants; however, the strength of associations fell with adjustment for confounders. \"The absolute risk was small, and the risk increase appears more modest than suggested in previous studies,\" the authors conclude.
