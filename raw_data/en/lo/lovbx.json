For centuries, adaptogen herbs have been used in both Chinese and Ayurvedic Medicine to support the immune system and improve the body's stress response. At Clean, we've created a line of fermented adaptogen supplement powders to help the body address the effects of stress and reduce stress in a natural way. Both Ayurvedic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine have a long history with adaptogens, using herbal medicine to treat various ailments dating back thousands of years. Today, adaptogens are known for their unique ability to \"adapt\" to the body's specific needs. Some of the benefits associated with adaptogens are improving cognitive function and mood, increasing energy levels, assisting with stress management, and helping mental fatigue. When it comes to the body's stress response, adaptogens are a natural yet effective way to manage chronic stress. When the body is subject to a stressor, adaptogens help the adrenal glands manufacture and release more stress hormones. Then, when the stress stops, adaptogens help the adrenal glands shut down quickly, to avoid prolonged stress and adrenal fatigue. Our adaptogens are certified organic and fermented to offer maximum bioavailability and the best results possible.
