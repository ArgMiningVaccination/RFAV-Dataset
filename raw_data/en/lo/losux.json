Yes, chiropractic medicine is safe. The most commonly reported side effect from a visit to the chiropractor is transient muscle soreness, similar to that of starting a new exercise routine. - What typically happens during a chiropractic manipulation? Chiropractic manipulation is a manual procedure that uses the highly refined skills developed during the doctor of chiropractic's intensive years of chiropractic education. The chiropractor typically uses his or her hands to manipulate the joints of the body, particularly the spine, in order to restore or enhance joint function. This often helps resolve joint inflammation and reduces the patient's pain. Chiropractic manipulation is a highly controlled procedure that rarely causes discomfort. The chiropractor adapts the procedure to meet the specific needs of each patient. Patients often note positive changes in their symptoms immediately following treatment from a chiropractor. - Can chiropractors treat older patients with bone loss (osteoporosis)? Yes, the chiropractors here at Baylor Scott & White Health modify treatments with gentle, low-force techniques for geriatric/osteoporotic patients. - Should my child see a chiropractor? Back and neck pain are less common in children, but chiropractic treatment is a very safe alternative for kids, especially young athletes with sports-related injuries. The chiropractors here are part of the sports medicine team at Baylor Scott & White Health, and they also work closely with orthopedic providers and physical therapists. - Do I need a referral to a chiropractor? Generally, no referral is needed to see a chiropractor, although there are a few HMOs that require a PCP referral to see a specialist or order testing. Please confirm with your insurance carrier prior to scheduling with a chiropractor if you are unsure of your benefits. - Why do I hear a popping sound when my chiropractor manipulates me? Manipulation of a joint may result in the release of a gas bubble between the joints, which makes a popping sound. The same thing occurs when you \"crack\" your knuckles. The noise is caused by the change of pressure within the joint, which results in gas bubbles being released. There is usually minimal, if any, discomfort involved when receiving chiropractic treatment. - Do I need diagnostic testing (X-rays or other imaging) as part of my chiropractic treatment? Your chiropractor will determine if imaging (like X-rays or CT scans) is necessary based on your medical history and examination. "}
