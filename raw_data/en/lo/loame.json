Healthcare practitioners are expected to put the 6 interests of patients first. Professional associations represent the interests of t heir members. 7 So when a professional association is comprised of healthcare practitioners, its interests may 8 differ from those of patients, creating a conflict for members. In addition, sometimes 9 practitioners' perspectives may be altered by indoctrination to a belief system, or 10 misinformation, so that a practitioner could be confused as to the reality of patient needs. 11 Politicians, in attempting to find expedient compromise, can value a \"win\" in the legislative 12 arena over the effects of that legislation. T hese forces all figure into the events that led to the 13 acceptance of chiropractic into the American Medicare system. Two healthcare systems in a 14 political fight lost sight of their main purpose: to provide care to patients without doing harm. 15 16 KEYWORDS 17 Healthcare policy, Medicare, Chiropractic, X -ray, Radiology, American Medical Association 18 19 2 INTRODUCTION 20 The classical version of the Hippocratic Oath contains a well -known sentiment: \"First 21 do no harm.\"1 The oath set forth an idea that has become integral to healthcare professions, 22 that the interests of patients supersede those of the practitioners. Medical physicians, 23 chiropractors and others continue to administer a version of it upon graduation.2 Yet, in 24 struggling for legitimacy, recognition, and market share in a fee -for-service structure, 25 professions can become disoriented to their priorities. Professional associations, which 26 represent the interests of their members, who in this case are health pract itioners, find that 27 sometimes those interests conflict with the interests of their members' patients, or the public 28 at large. In addition, sometimes practitioners' perspectives may be altered by indoctrination 29 to a belief system, or misinformation, so that a practitioner could be confused as to the reality 30 of patient needs. These forces all figure into the events leading to the acceptance of 31 chiropractic into the American Medicare system. I believe this paper is the first scholarly 32 work do explore these eve nts. Themes of professionalization, professional identity, and 33 legitimacy figure prominently. Chiropractic sought legitimation through wider acceptance by 34 policymakers and other healthcare providers, and they wanted a share of the aged care 35 market. Organiz ed medicine sought to protect the public from what they considered a danger 36 to public health, and they fought to control government reimbursement services. Legislators 37 acted as they usually do, by weighing public opinion and lobbyist influence, then taking the 38 expedient action. In the end, chiropractic was accepted into Medicare, but not to the degree 39 they had hoped. Organized medicine inserted a \"poisoned pill\" into the legislation at the last 40 minute, hoping to derail the entire process, but it did not wor k as anticipated. Legislators 41 scored a victory, though, by passing a popular bill expanding Medicare with much more than 42 just the addition of chiropractic. Richard Nixon , who was helped to re -election in 1972 by its 43 passage, called it \"landmark legislation that will end many old inequities and will provide a 44 3 new uniform system of well -earned benefits for older Americans, the blind and the 45 disabled.\"3 All participants in the chiropractic portion of the Medicare expansion process 46 focused on their own interest s rather than those of their patients and some patients were 47 harme d, physically, mentally, and/or financially. 48 The [REDACTED] University Human Research Ethics Committee approved this 49 research (approval number 2012/152). This paper draws on a variety of pr imary sources of 50 information , including interviews with several key figures involved in the events described 51 herein as well as their contemporaneous writings in professional publications, the 52 Congressional Record, and one audio recording . I also utilized secondary sources like books, 53 newspapers and journal articles accessed in public and private archives . 54 The history of health care in the United States of America (USA) involves disparate 55 forces, including government, insurance companies, pharmace utical and medical device 56 manufacturers, doctors' groups, and professional associations. Emphasis on health promotion 57 and consumerism have also affected policy decisions. There has been no unified national 58 policy on healthcare in the USA, but rather many p olicies on various aspects of healthcare. 59 This patchwork has resulted in entrepreneurship and research that has offered exceptional 60 care to some, but not all, and it carries a massive economic cost. Healthcare spending in the 61 USA is more than twice per cap ita the amount in the UK, and the overall outcomes are not as 62 good. All the American government provider systems arose after a private insurance system 63 was well -established, and were shaped to support that private system, with the fee -for-service 64 model tha t was economically advantageous for doctors, hospitals, and medical groups. One 65 of the most influential organ izations in consolidating this structure was the American 66 Medical Association (AMA) which had successfully opposed all forms of nationalized 67 health care.4 68 Medical professional associations , including the AMA, have long been influential in 69 4 American healthcare.5 In the mid -19th Century, a wide variety of 'irregular \" health 70 practitioners competed on a market basis with \"regular \" or orthodox physicians fo r patients. 71 Many medical treatments at this time were either without effect other than placebo; others 72 were simply dangerous.6 This disorgan ized environment led a group of physicians to draft a 73 set of ethical and educational standards for practitioners. Th e document became the 1847 74 Code of Medical Ethics of the AMA. It was a public proclamation that formed the basis of 75 the fiduciary relationship between patients and practitioners. In exchange for the 76 responsibility of ensuring trust in the uniform standards of skills and behaviour for physicians 77 as well as acting in the public interest , it claimed autonomy for the profession.7 But 78 Sociologist Tracey Adams cites the fluidity in the definition of 'public interest' and notes 79 changes in response to public demand over time. She also acknowledges incomplete 80 understanding as to the true motivations of professions invoking the concept of public 81 interest. Whether used in earnest or cynically to gain power and status, t he social contract 82 made the professional associat ion more powerful .8 Physicians were allowed to determine 83 standards of skills and behaviour that one must demonstrate in order to become and remain a 84 physician, and even the scope of what is considered medical practice. The 1847 pact formed 85 the base on whic h were built the ideas of self -regulation and monopoly power which would 86 eventually impact all alternative systems, including chiropractic, once it was founded in 87 1895. Sociologist and authority on professionalism Eliot Freidson noted that exclusivity of 88 membership and special expertise supported by professional associations helped create public 89 acceptance of a profession's self -regulation.9 The social pact could only be subsequently 90 altered from within the association, and transgressors could be banished a nd left without its 91 protections.10 92 Alternative healthcare systems, which by definition were outside medical associations 93 like the AMA, were viewed as rivals, marginal ized with rhetoric, disparaging labels, and 94 5 later, legal action. Chiropractors were only one group among many, including osteopaths, 95 homeopaths and Christian Scientists, who were called \"quacks \" and denigrated in various 96 publications.11 Beginning in 1870, organ ized medicine, led by the AMA, began to use its 97 power in orde r to suppress these alternative systems. Legislators were lobbied to pass laws 98 regulating the practice of medicine. Medicine became defined as provision of any type of 99 healthcare by any type of practitioner. In 1906, the AMA was able to ensure that licensu re 100 was granted only to graduates of schools approved by their Council of Medical Education.12 101 Thus, alternative practitioners could be prosecuted for practicing medicine without a licence. 102 This was the beginning of a hegemonic process continued by the AMA f or decades. 103 Professional autonomy is often moderated by government regulation. But calls for 104 oversight have often come from within a profession. Regulation brings legitimation and 105 additional enforcement mechanisms for exclusivity of access. That is, the p ublic assumes that 106 regulated practitioners are competent, and the profession can limit entry to its ranks, which 107 can help ensure competence of practitioners. It can also decrease competition. This has been 108 seen frequently with healthcare, where medical pro fessional associations and the state work 109 together, limiting the ability of alternative practitioners like homeopaths, botanical healers, 110 apothecaries and others to provide services designated as \"medical.\"13 111 A number of other factors also assisted medicine 's rise to dominance. Medical 112 anthropologist Hans Baer character izes the hegemony of the AMA as a class issue, involving 113 a coalition of interests with a common goal: \"The emerging alliance around the turn of the 114 century between the AMA, which consisted pri marily of elite practitioners and medical 115 researchers based in prestigious universities and the industrial capitalist class, ultimately 116 permitted biomedicine to establish political, economic, and ideological dominance over rival 117 medical systems. \"14 118 Scienti fic advancement, such as with inoculations, meant that patients became less 119 6 likely to understand how treatments worked, yet nonetheless were able to benefit from those 120 treatments. Matthew K. Wynia, long -time Director of the AMA Institute for Ethics and 121 Center for Patient Safety, posit s that over time this led to pride, paternalism, loss of empathy 122 and reduced standards of customer service in the medical profession. The growth of scientific 123 medicine also achieved so many successes in cures and treatments tha t arguments against 124 medical control of healthcare seemed almost ridiculous.15 Hubris and power combined to lead 125 to a sense of entitlement. The AMA began to believe its judgment was infallible, and that the 126 state was its enforcement arm. 127 The hegemonic proce ss helped lead to the disappearance of some alternative 128 therapies , but many still exist. Of all the complementary and alternative ( CAM ) health 129 professions, only American osteopathy took the route of eliminating its alternative practices 130 and beliefs. This r esulted in the AMA removing its cultism label from osteopathy in 1961. 131 The AMA even extended membership to osteopaths and allopathic residency programmes 132 accepted osteopathic graduates. But the tradeoff for osteopathy was that by the 1970s it had 133 lost its unique identity in America and was virtually indistinguishable from medicine.16 134 Several authors have touched on the chiropractic episode, but little historical analysis 135 has been undertaken. Two contemporaneous authors and chiropractic supporters, AMA 136 whistleblower William Trever and chiropractor Chester Wilk, adopted a position of outrage 137 at the tactics of the medical opposition to chiropractic, and both related much first -hand 138 information in their books. Wilk later became the main plaintiff in a successful anti -trust 139 lawsuit against the AMA.17 Trever included reproductions of internal AMA and state -based 140 medical group memos as well as correspondence with legislators. Some of these documents 141 were also used as exhibits in Wilk's suit. But neither author related the specific details of the 142 Medicare episode.18 Peterson and Wiese in Chiropractic: An Illustrated History, sociologists 143 Holly Folk, Susan Smith -Cunnien and Walter Wardwell, and historian J. Stuart Moore only 144 7 briefly mention Medicare in their histories.19 145 None of the above sources explain the legislative manoeuvring that resulted in the 146 outcome. None provide the details of how the traditional use of radiography in chiropractic 147 enabled the AM A to develop the x -ray clause for the legislation, the mechanism by which the 148 scope of practice was limited. A brief background on the traditional chiropractic healthcare 149 paradigm is necessary for context. 150 THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHIROPRACTIC 151 Althou gh manual manipulation of bones and joints as a healing art has existed for 152 centuries, the particular method that came to be called chiropractic originated in the USA in 153 1895. For the first few decades of the its existence, chiropractic considered itself a lternative 154 rather than complementary to medicine, and some in the profession still do. The traditional 155 chiropractic ideology or practice paradigm was a form of vitalism. Daniel David Palmer, 156 known as D.D., was a Canadian -born merchant and self -styled \"magn etic\" healer living in 157 Davenport, Iowa at that time. Palmer credited a mysterious force that he called Universal 158 Intelligence, essentially a form of god, as responsible for life and health. This force 159 manifested in humans as \"Innate Intelligence \" in the br ain, and was transmitted as \"nerve 160 impulses \" down the spinal column through nerves to all the organs and body parts. Therefore, 161 if a vertebra was slightly out of place, a state he called \"subluxation \", it could impinge 162 nerves, alter the flow of the impulse s, and create ill health. D.D. held the opinion that 95% of 163 disease was caused by subluxated vertebrae and the remaining 5% by subluxated peripheral 164 joints, such as the elbow or ankle.20 Palmer began teaching his new theory to others almost 165 immediately, inc luding to his son Bartlett Joshua Palmer, known as B.J. After D.D. suddenly 166 departed Iowa for the west coast in 1902, B.J. assumed responsibility for the school his father 167 had started, asserting himself as leader of the budding profession . In 1910 he made a decision 168 that would have repercussions more than half a century later by incorporating x-ray into 169 8 chiropractic as a way to prove subluxations.21 170 Through the mid -20th century, chiropractic took steps toward professionalization. 171 Kansas and North Dakota were the first states to license chiropractors and by 1963 all but 172 two states had chiropractic legislation, although scopes of practice varied.22 The National 173 Board of Chi ropractic Examiners was established in 1961, and the Federation of Chiropractic 174 Licensing Boards in 1968.23 The Council on Chiropractic Education, formed in 1935 by the 175 National Chiropractic Association (forerunner to the ACA) in an effort to standardize 176 chiropractic education, was accredited by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare 177 in August 1972.24 Reforms led to the decline in numbers of teaching institutions from 42 in 178 1930, most with 18 -month courses, to 15 in 1963, all with 4 -year courses. The se efforts seem 179 to have been taken in a sincere effort to gain legitimacy. Donning the mantle of orthodoxy in 180 organizational structures must also have made chiropractic more palatable by a wider swath 181 of legislators. 182 Like other CAM professions, chiropracti c has a schism that it has not yet reconciled.25 183 The two main groups of chiropractors have often been referred to as \"straights \" and \"mixers .\" 184 This division reflected an emphasis on treatments employed. Straights used manual 185 manipulation or \"adjusting \" of the spine for all ailments. Mixers \"adjusted \" as well, but also 186 used heat, cold, ultraviolet, massage techniques, and other ancillary measures not including 187 drugs and surgery. In this paper, I change the focus of the division from treatment methods to 188 aetio logy of disease. Broadly, some within the profession hold to the traditional idea that 189 subluxations are the predominant influence on health, and often radiography is considered the 190 primary tool for detecting this \"lesion .\"26 This group will be referred to a s traditional or 191 vitalistic chiropractors. The other group will be referred to as biomedically -oriented 192 chiropractors. Generally, they believe in germ theory, the utility of vaccinations, judicious 193 use of diagnostic imaging, and other mainstream healthcare tenets. They focus on manual 194 9 therapy for biomechanical conditions, view themselves as complementary rather than 195 alternative, and seek integration with overarching health systems. In my opinion, it is more 196 important to understand the paradigm a healthcare practitioner applies to health and disease 197 than to focus on treatment methods. The overall paradigm is more revealing of a 198 practitioner's comprehension of diagnosis, science, and evidence, and therefore gives greater 199 insight into the differences in the chi ropractic factions. 200 These groups do not neatly divide into the two main professional associations in the 201 USA, the American Chiropractic Association (ACA) and International Chiropractors 202 Association (ICA) . There is overlap of health paradigm in both members hip populations, 203 although the ICA tends to have more traditionalists in its leadership and constituents, and the 204 ACA more biomedicals. In the 1960s, the ACA had about twice as many members as the 205 ICA. There were also \"independents\" who belonged to neither group, and in this group the 206 paradigm varied as well. For purposes of this paper, the predominant paradigm of each 207 association will be used in the understanding that uniformity of opinion did not exist, but 208 tendencies did. 209 THE AMA'S EFFORTS TO CONTAIN AND ELIMINATE CHIROPRACTIC 210 By the 1960s, most alternative health systems in the USA had either disappeared, like 211 Thompsonians and naprapaths, had been marginalised into insignificance like Christian 212 Scientists and naturopaths , or been incorporated into medicin e like osteopaths. Chiropractors, 213 however, retained their independence, and had gained a small but consistent part of the 214 healthcare market. About 10% of Americans and Canadians have used their services.27 215 Chiropractic became a particular target of the AMA. The AMA's methods were many and 216 varied. They printed and distributed thousands of anti -chiropractic brochures to schools, 217 colleges, medical practices and organ izations. They sent fake prospective student applications 218 to chiropractic colleges in order to expose weaknesses in the education system. They wrote 219 10 letters to professional journals and popular magazines, lobbied legislators at the local, state, 220 and federal levels to try to exclude chiropractic, and they pressured members of influential 221 committees.28 222 In 1963, the AMA formed a Committee on Quackery to \"[determine] the true nature 223 of chiropractic and its practitioners, and to inform the medical profession and the public of its 224 findings. \"29 The product of this investigation was a pamphlet, entitled Chiropractic: The 225 Unscientific Cult . In setting the tone for the Committee, the AMA House of Delegates issued 226 the following statement: \"Either the theories and practices of scientific medicine are right and 227 those of the cultists are wrong, or the theories and practices of the cultists are right and those 228 of scientific medicine are wrong. \"30 In 1967, H. Doyl Taylor, secretary of the Committee on 229 Quackery and a leading figure in AMA efforts on chiropractic, spoke at a \"quackery 230 workshop \" held at Ball State University in Indiana, framing the discussion with this 231 statement: \"As you know, [chiropractic] is a cult, about as far removed from scientific 232 medicine, the diagnosis and treatment of human illness as it is poss ible to get. \"31 The 233 ridiculing nature of these words de -legitimised chiropractors in the structure of the argument. 234 It portrayed the AMA as representing the norm and chiropractic as deviant. Sociologists 235 Yvonne Villanueva -Russell and Susan Smith -Cunnien ass erted that by defining chiropractic 236 as \"deviant \" and using derogatory terms like \"unscientific cult ,\" the AMA could frame itself 237 as mainstream, reasonable, and scientific , for its own social and political benefit.32 238 Despite acknowledging that a variety of practice paradigms existed within 239 chiropractic, the AMA's focus remained on the vitalistic chiropractors.33 Some of the 240 statements by the Committee on Quackery seem political or adversarial, rather than clinically 241 detached : \"With the establishment of the Co mmittee on Quackery, in 1964, extensive study 242 was made to determine exactly what chiropractic is and where it is most vulnerable to public 243 exposure. \"34 Trever expresse s it this way: \"the Committee lacked sufficient 'scientific proof ' 244 11 to back their slanderous campaign .\"35 Because of the extreme measures to ensure secrecy at 245 the AMA, the totality of the information that the Committee obtained on chiropractic 246 practices is not known.36 However, the examples they cited were damning for chiropractic. 247 The pa mphlet included reproductions of advertisements claiming cures for various diseases 248 including cancer and mental illness. Chiropractors were quoted making statements against the 249 utility of vaccinations. Repeatedly noted was an epistemology invoking appeal t o authority; 250 the \"authority \" was usually either D.D. or B.J. Palmer. The Unit Plan also denigrated 251 chiropractic educational standards, which were, in fact, inferior to those of medicine.37 It 252 further stated: \"The prime mission of the Committee on Quackery a t its founding was to be, 253 first, the containment of chiropractic, and, ultimately, the elimination of chiropractic as a 254 health hazard .\"38 Part of the plan was to influence legislative bodies.39 It stated that \"the 255 Medicare -Medicaid rules on chiropractic [mus t be] drawn as tightly as possible. \"40 The Unit 256 Plan described ghost -writing policy statements and distributing publications on behalf of 257 various \"independent \" bodies such as the American Federation of Labor -Congress of 258 Industrial Organizations (AFL -CIO) an d the Consumer Federation of America in order to 259 lend the weight of ostensible support from respected organ izations to their message.41 The 260 AMA sponsored multiple regional conferences called \"Health Quackery - Chiropractic \" over 261 a period of five years. They attempted to derail accreditation of chiropractic schools. Doctors 262 and hospitals were forbidden from granting chiropractors any privileges including receiving 263 referrals of patients for x -rays or blood tests. The Unit Plan did concede that after 264 chiropract ic ceased to exist, chiropractors, with their manual skills, might be able to be 265 retrained \"to serve as another extension of the physician 's hands .\"42 266 At this point it could be argued that the AMA and other medical associations 267 genuinely believed that they were acting in the public interest, fulfilling their fiduciary duty 268 as they saw it, by attempting to limit public access to chiropractors, whom they viewed as 269 12 dangerous. Their later actions became more ethically questionable. 270 THE INCLUSION OF CHIROPRACTIC IN MEDICARE 271 In 1964 , Lyndon Johnson won the presidency ; his agenda included improving 272 healthcare .43 However , concessions had to be made to medical special interest group s, 273 including coverage for physician outpatient services as well as hospital visits for both general 274 and specialty practitioners. Physicians were given total freedom in diagnosis, treatment and 275 prescription of medications. The fee -for-service model was retained, and people were able to 276 see whichever doctor they wanted.44 The bill with these provisions became the first iteration 277 of Medicare, and it passed with AMA approval in 1965,45 resulting in improved health and 278 well-being for many people across the country.46 Medicare quickly became popular, and 279 other health professions , including chiropractic, optometry, social work, and eight others 280 requested inclusion . Congress opened an investigation into the possibility of expanding 281 Medicare .47 In 1967, Wilbur Cohen, the Secretary of Health, Educ ation, and Welfare (HEW), 282 was tasked with undertaking the study . 283 The government required the health professions to provide evidence of legitimacy. 284 The Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards (FCLB) oversaw chiropractic licensing . 285 Chiropractor Richard E. Vincent represented the FCLB in testimony to the House Ways and 286 Means Committee, assuring Congress that there were professional standards as well as a 287 mechanism for upholding them.48 However, the assessment process turned out to be neither 288 straightforwar d nor transparent. According to sociologist and HEW committee member 289 Walter Wardwell, the report essentially had been written before the committee even met.49 290 He also related that pressure was applied to members of the committee to adopt the AMA 291 position. W ardwell later revealed all the anti -chiropractic documents and verbal 292 recommendations from AMA members that he had received as a member of the committee.50 293 Sociologist Catherine Biggs has indicated that in Canada, the government responded 294 13 to the tension be tween the popularity of chiropractic services and the opposition of the 295 powerful medical lobby by calling for a Royal Commission or equivalent to study the matter. 296 In Canada's case, the government reports provided rationales for including chiropractic in 297 state-funded healthcare.51 Not so in the USA. The final HEW report issued 28 December 298 1968 recommended that chiropractic not be included in Medicare, concluding: 299 Chiropractic theory and practice are not based upon the body of basic 300 knowledge related to heal th, disease, and health care that has been widely 301 accepted by the scientific community. Moreover, irrespective of its theory, 302 the scope and quality of chiropractic education do not prepare the 303 practitioner to make an adequate diagnosis and provide appropri ate 304 treatment.52 305 Upon receiving news of the report, the chiropractic professional associations 306 responded with a White Paper, accusing Congress of a biased process and attempting to 307 clarify what they perceived as mischaracterizations of the profession. Cong ress dismissed it 308 as invalid.53 The two main chiropractic associations, the ACA and ICA, embarked on a 309 political pressure campaign. It was compr ised of three elements: working to amalgamate the 310 two associations, letter writing to Congress, and lobbying through personal connections. 311 Being faced with a larger, better funded, and more politically connected lobbying 312 organ ization in the AMA, it was of para mount importance for chiropractic to present a 313 unified front to the world. In addition, experience had taught chiropractors that state and 314 federal panels insisted on a single body of representation. ACA member James Cox 315 remembers: \"I've testified in my sta te of Indiana before House and Senate committees. If you 316 go in there split, you know what they say: 'You get it together and then you come back .'\"54 317 This created the impetus to join the two chiropractic professional associations. The ICA had 318 about 4000 memb ers.55 They were overt in their advocacy of a traditional, vitalistic view of 319 14 chiropractic and wanted the legislation to consider only the treatment of vertebral 320 subluxation.56 The ACA had about 7500 members, and tended to be more biomedically - 321 oriented . The ACA's position was that chiropractors should be reimbursed for all the services 322 that they provided, not just for attending to vertebral subluxations. These services varied state 323 to state, depending on the licensure regulations, but included therapeutic ult rasound, 324 electrotherapy, massage techniques, and rehabilitation protocols.57 325 The ICA insisted that the ACA agree to a definition of chiropractic known as the 326 \"Chicago scope of practice .\"58 It focused on spinal subluxation s as the cause of all disease, 327 with radiography for subluxation detection . Contemporaneous articles in chiropractic 328 magazines included promotion of x -ray imaging for subluxation analysis by ICA 329 chiropractors. For example: \"It enables him to see inside and through the living body, 330 pinpointing with accuracy, the health problem areas... This aid is necessary in visualising the 331 misalignments of the spinal column... \"59 The strength of this belief can be seen in its 332 longevity and the language used by some of its proponents. In 1977, Leon R Coelho, chair of 333 the ICA Radiation Control Committee and director of the Roentgenology Department of the 334 Palmer College of Chiropractic wrote an article entitled \"If spinography is dead, so is 335 chiropractic \" in an ICA publication and included the following: 336 Spinography is an imperfect system. Chiropractic is an imperfect 337 system, yet growing and surviving in an imperfect world. But do you know 338 something? IT IS THE BEST OF ALL SYSTEMS OF WHICH WE ARE 339 CONSCIOUS. HAVE FAITH IN IT, NOURISH IT, LOVE IT, because it 340 is all part of something much greater than us, and that something, within 341 itself, is perfection. [All emphasis original.]60 342 In contrast, ACA members published articles on the mainstream use of the x -ray for 343 pathological diagnosis and railed against the idea of using i onising radiation as a screening 344 15 tool for all patients.61 The ICA model for the radiographic visual ization of subluxations was 345 denigrated by ACA chiropractors including Joseph Howe, who noted that normal anatomical 346 asymmetry, minor variations in osseous arc hitecture, slight changes in patient position during 347 radiography, and the physics of the x -ray beam all invalidated the idea that \"subluxations \" 348 could be identified and quantified on radiographs. The tiny misalignments claimed by some 349 chiropractors to be l esions causing disease were due either to illusion or imagination.62 The 350 schism in chiropractic was particularly stark on the use of the x -ray. The potential merger of 351 the two chiropractic associations failed again.63 352 The ICA and ACA submitted separate stat ements to the government. The ICA 353 requested reimbursement for spinal x -rays and spinal adjustments only. The ACA statement 354 acknowledged the usefulness of standard physical examination and diagnostic tests and also 355 discussed \"subluxation ,\" but as a biomecha nical dysfunction, rather than a vitalistic entity , 356 and without the necessity of radiography to identify .64 The ACA statement also invoked the 357 idea of freedom of choice in health care and requested recognition of states' rights in regard 358 to scope of practic e. That is, the ACA argued that Medicare legislation should reimburse for 359 whatever services chiropractors were licensed to provide in each state, rather than be limited 360 to adjusting spinal subluxations as the ICA advocated. This limit was viewed as overrid ing a 361 state's right to determine the scope of practice for chiropractors.65 HEW denied this argument 362 in 1969 , citing lack of evidence for the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment and asserting 363 that their responsibility for the \"safety and welfare of bene ficiaries\" allowed HEW to 364 determine the services to be reimbursed.66 365 Because the two chiropractic associations portrayed chiropractic differently, the AMA 366 was able to choose a portrayal of chiropractic that could serve to bolster its position opposing 367 Medic are coverage for chiropractors. Hoyt B. Duke of the ACA recognised this, writing that 368 the rigidity of the ICA's position and the infighting that it caused were making chiropractic 369 16 vulnerable to attack by the AMA.67 There is no indication that either the ICA or ACA were 370 acting cynically or simply playing for power; they both sincerely believed that their position 371 was the correct one. The ICA believed that they were preserving chiropractic more truly to 372 the founder's ideals. The ACA was less concerned with tradition and was trying to move 373 chiropractic into a new phase of existence, embracing a more scientific approach to 374 healthcare. 375 The two chiropractic professional associations did cooperate on other lobbying 376 efforts . David D. (Dave) Palmer, grandson of founder D.D. Palmer, was the president of the 377 Palmer College of Chiropractic in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As such, his assent was 378 considered necessary for consensus on any strategic chiropractic -wide project. Palm er met 379 with ICA President William Day, ACA President Gerald Brassard, and other influential 380 chiropractors in 1970 to discuss the \"intensified Medicare -inclusion plan .\"68 It included an 381 organ ized letter writing operation to encourage Congressional Representa tives and Senators 382 to support including chiropractic in the Medicare expansion bill . The sample letters 383 distributed by the chiropractic associations highlighted the benefits of chiropractic and also 384 appealed to sensitive areas in American politics : market freedom and American 385 Exceptionalism.69 American Exceptionalism was expressed by sociologist and political 386 theorist Seymour Lipset as: liberty, egalitarianism, individualism, populism, and laissez -faire. 387 Lipset noted that even before the rise of the neoconse rvatives, which started with President 388 Ronald Reagan, the USA had lower rates of taxation, a less developed welfare state, and 389 fewer government -owned industries than other industrialised nations.70 The idea of freedom 390 in the healthcare marketplace attained similar enshrinement and this was also present in the 391 chiropractic community.71 Chiropractors argued that the AMA and government policies were 392 restricting peoples' freedom to choose the health care provider that they desired. William 393 Day wrote, \"It is the b irth-right of every American citizen to have the right to choose his own 394 17 particular type of health care, and it is our duty to make it possible for them to have the 395 opportunity to choose chiropractic! \"72 The goal was to have 10,000 letters sent from 396 chiropr actors and patients . Ultimately, at least a million letters went out .73 Because of this 397 popular support, many House Members introduced bills on the subject. Congressman Wilbur 398 Mills, who had been instrumental to the passage of Medicaid legislation, noted th at this had 399 influenced the decision to include chiropractic .74 400 William Scott (Bill) Day was a particularly influential figure in the lobbying effort. 401 Day had been a Washington State Representative from 1959 -1969 before being elected to the 402 State Senate from 1969 -1980 .75 He was a graduate of the Palmer School (1947), and the son 403 of two Palmer graduates. He took over the clinic in Spokane, Washington that his parents 404 started, and his son Tim, also a Palmer graduate, has operated it since Day's death in 1984. 405 Day helped ensure that traditional chiropractic was legislated as the scope of practice in 406 Washington.76 He also supported the traditional paradigm for chiropractic in Medicare, 407 testifying to that effect as Legislative Chairman of the ICA in front of the Sena te Finance 408 Committee on September 16, 1970, along with other representatives of the ICA and ACA.77 409 Steve Renner also attended the Palmer school, and was employed in Day's clinic from 410 1976 - 1982. He recalled discussing the matter with Day: \"[Bill] became friends with 411 Washington State's two U.S. Senators, Henry Jackson and Warren Magnuson. These two 412 were high -ranking Demo crats in Congress. So because Bill was subluxation -based and his 413 connections with Jackson and Magnuson is how chiropractic became included in Medicare 414 [sic].\"78 Richard Vincent, an ACA chiropractor and president of the FCLB at the time, recalls 415 the situatio n similarly: \"Bill Day was President of the [Washington] State Senate. Magnuson 416 was the Senator from Washington to Federal Government, and he was chair of the 417 Appropriations Committee, powerful. He was a driving force on healthcare. Now this is my 418 personal opinion: the influence that Bill Day had on Senator Magnuson was what drove the 419 18 subluxation [focus of the legislation]. \"79 Day's perspective, as president of the ICA, was 420 transmitted to the federal legislature through Senators Jackson and Magnuson. It limited 421 chiropractic to the Chicago definition, that is, spinal subluxation relief requiring routine 422 radiography to detect subluxations. Later, in December 1972, Palmer issued a statement 423 disavowing the indiscriminate or routine use of x -rays, but affirming the remainder of the 424 \"Chicago definition \" of chiropractic.80 425 The Congressional debate on chiropractic was robust. I nfluential Senator Ted 426 Kennedy opposed including chiropractic in Medicare. He cited cases of chiropractors 427 overstating their abilities to cure serious disease, like cancer, causing patients to avoid seeing 428 medical doctors, with tragic results . But other Senators cou ntered that all health care 429 professions had a small percentage of incompetent or fraudulent practitioners. State 430 regulation , under which licensing/registration boards were established and maintained, was 431 considered adequate to protect the public in those p rofessions and so it should be for 432 chiropractic as well.81 A few legislators related positive personal experience with a 433 chiropractor, but freedom of choice proved to be a particularly powerful argument regarding 434 healthcare in Congress. Most legislators agr eed that the government should not tell citizens 435 that they could not go to a chiropractor instead of a medical doctor if that was their choice. 82 436 As sociologist Paul Starr noted, Americans were not willing to submit to the 437 judgement of experts, even in the realm of healthcare.83 In fact, there was little evidence of 438 clinical effectiveness on which legislators could base a judgement. There were case anecdotes 439 from the publications of the professional associations and patient testimonials in pamphlets, 440 adverti sements, and the letters to Congress. These \"success stories\" did not contain the level 441 of clinical detail to be publishable in peer -reviewed journals. The first random ized controlled 442 trial of chiropractic was not published until 1990.84 The AMA gleaned evi dence against 443 chiropractic similarly, from advertisements, anecdotes of patients harmed by chiropractors, 444 19 and by the investigation the AMA did into chiropractic education.85 445 The bill expanding Medicare was debated in the U.S. Congress for two years, passi ng 446 in 1972, and it included chiropractic .86 It contained 144 changes in welfare and health 447 benefits, and was estimated to cost $5 billion. Its effects were vast, including coverage for 448 chronic renal disease, disabled people under 65, a Chiropractic was a ve ry small part.87 449 According to the New York Times (NYT), the House members of the conference committee 450 wanted to delay inclusion of chiropractic in favour of another study of it, but Senate members 451 wanted inclusion. Political \"horse trading\" ensued and the H ouse yielded to the Senate in 452 exchange for unknown concessions on other matters. In addition, the NYT reported that some 453 sources said Wilbur Mills was annoyed at the AMA, and others indicated he \"was tired of 454 standing up almost alone to the pressure of the chiropractors.\"88 The AMA took action to try 455 to neutral ize chiropractic's inclusion just before final passage of the bill in Congress by 456 leveraging the idea that \"subluxations\" were the cause of disease . Medical doctor Stephen 457 Barrett, a leading figure in the fight against chiropractic for decades , wrote to the AMA and 458 suggested that they bring a lawsuit, to \" present to the court the impossibility of writing 459 regulations to pay for something that did not exist. \" But he recalled receiving no respons e.89 460 Instead, the AMA decided to try to amend the legislation just before passage. 461 AMA EFFORTS TO LIMIT THE UTILITY OF MEDICARE FOR 462 CHIROPRACTORS 463 After the House and Senate each pass their versions of a bill, any differences between 464 the two are reconciled i n a conference committee. This committee is usually composed of 465 senior members of the House and Senate committees that originally considered the bill . 466 Amendments may be introduced during the conference committee, and a fter consensus is 467 achieved, the final version of the bill is produced for a vote in both the House and Senate. 468 This is a straight yea or nay vote; n o further amendments are allowed on any bill that has 469 20 been through conference committee . If passed, it is sent to the President to sign into law o r to 470 veto. 471 According to Stephen Barrett , wording from the AMA was inserted during the 472 conference committee.90 The specific clause allowed reimbursement to chiropractors only for 473 manual manipulation of spinal subluxations that had been documented by x -ray. No other 474 services were covered, nor was the cost of taking and interpreting the radiographs 475 themselves. Thirty years after the Medicare legislation passed, Barrett recalled the episode : 476 A few weeks after the law was passed, Doyl Taylor, head of the AMA 477 Department of Investigation told me that when chiropractic inclusion 478 appeared inevitable, the \"subluxation \" language was inserted with the hope 479 of preventing chiropractors from actually being paid. The idea's originator 480 thought that because chiropractic's tr aditional (metaphysical) 481 \"subluxations \" were visible only to chiropractors, this provision would 482 sabotage their coverage.91 483 The NYT reported on this amendment made during conference committee, but gives 484 no attribution to any person(s) for the change.92 The a mendment effectively nullified the 485 practical utility of reimbursement for chiropractic services, and may have been another factor 486 that allowed the House to accede to the inclusion of chiropractic in Medicare. At this point in 487 the Medicare expansion process , any legislator objecting to one element in this massive and 488 popular bill would have had to vote against the entire bill, a politically unwise move. The 489 final bill, including the amendment to chiropractic, passed in both Houses. O n 30 October , 490 just a few days before the presidential election of 1972, President Richard M. Nixon signed it 491 into law. 492 The regulations in the bill had been narrowly formulated so that chiropractors were 493 considered \"physicians \" for the purpose of radiographically diagnosing and ma nually treating 494 21 a \"subluxation \" but not in any wider definition. Specifically, they were not \"physicians \" 495 under U.S.C. 1395x (s)(3), the part of the law that provided reimbursement for taking x -rays. 496 Reimbursement was also not given for physical exam or ot her diagnostic procedures.93 497 Medicare reimbursed radiographs if a medical doctor ordered them, but the AMA forbade 498 medical doctors and hospitals at the time from accepting referrals from chiropractors.94 499 Chiropractors were licen sed in all fifty states to tak e radiographs. But if they performed their 500 own radiography, chiropractors would either have to absorb the cost themselves or ask 501 patients to pay for them. Therefore this legislation caused potential financial harm to patients . 502 Members of the ICA greeted the news of inclusion in Medicare with short -lived 503 jubilation until they real ized they would not be reimbursed for the mandated radiography.95 504 But within the ACA, it caused an immediate division of opinion. Some members thought 505 Medicare should be ab andoned, rather than submitting to the codification in law of such a 506 narrow scope of practice. Joseph Howe was an outspoken ACA member involved with the 507 internal politics of the situation. He assessed the legislative outcome as deleterious and 508 expressed hi s opinion to the leadership: \"I said throw it back. Please don't tie us in to that 509 idea of subluxation being the only thing we do. But they didn't [throw it back]. I think, 510 personally, it's my opinion that Medicare has been a detriment to the profession fr om the 511 beginning. \"96 However, the new law brought prestige, legitimation, and gave access to a new 512 cohort of patients, even if chiropractors received inadequate reimbursement for those in that 513 cohort. Ultimately, the ACA leadership decided to accept it, hop ing that it might be 514 broadened in the future.97 James Winterstein , long -time president of National College of 515 Chiropractic , and an ACA member at the time, acknowledges the dilemma : \"I was supportive 516 of inclusion of chiropractic medicine in the Medicare prog ram, but not in the way it was 517 statutorily developed [limiting the scope of practice to spinal subluxation relief and requiring 518 x-rays] . That view was shared by most so called \"mixers\" of the time. We all thought, 519 22 however that this was the beginning that t hat as a profession we would be able to change the 520 language to provide a far better functioning statute for the profession and our profession .\"98 521 THE CHIROPRACTIC SOLUTION TO MEDICARE REQUIREMENTS 522 Chiropractors had many different definitions of vertebral subluxation, mostly tiny 523 changes in position, not acknowledged as real by the medical community and unable to be 524 reliably identified on radiographs by different chiropractors.99 The ACA called for a meeting 525 to standard ize the definition of radiographically de monstrable subluxations. The meeting took 526 place in Texas in November 1972 and became referred to as the Houston Conference. Within 527 the ACA there existed a group of chiropractors with a special interest in diagnostic imaging. 528 They undertook additional train ing as well as written and oral certification exams in order to 529 achieve the Diplomate of the American Chiropractic Board of Radiology (DACBR). These 530 \"chiropractic radiologists \" were called upon at the Houston Conference.100 531 The radiographic demonstration of subluxation was imaginary to at least some 532 involved in the Houston Conference. There were deep misgiving and arguments on the 533 subject. Many of the participants considered the \"subluxation \" to be a functional lesion of 534 joint motion, rather than a displacement. For these chiropractors, there were no vitalistic 535 implications of \"the cause of all disease \", but rather \"subluxation \" was a biomechanical 536 dysfunction amenable to a variety of manual methods, of which chiropractic adju stments 537 were only one.101 538 The new Medicare requirement ran counter to safety guidelines on the use of x -rays in 539 requiring all patients to be radiographed. Joseph Howe wrote: \"To demand that there be 540 radiological evidence of vertebral subluxation in order t o justify chiropractic treatment is 541 irresponsible. It is totally contradictory to proper radiological health procedure which 542 demands a clinical reason for any application of ioni zing radiation to a human being .\"102 The 543 x-ray requirement even seemed nonsensi cal to some legislators. Senator Mike Gravel 544 23 recogn ized that the AMA had put in place a requirement that ran counter to best medical 545 practice. He wrote that the law \"imposes an improper interference with the work and 546 judgment of the Chiropractor. It does n ot guarantee the health and well -being of the patient; 547 in fact, it may endanger it .\"103 The idea that there was no safe dose of ionizing radiation, 548 called the linear, no -threshold (LNT) model, had been introduced to the world by Herman 549 Muller at his Nobel Pr ize acceptance speech in 1946.104 Although there have been challenges 550 to this model, 105 and it has never been fully accepted in the chiropractic community,106 it 551 became the dominant model in the ensuing decades. By 1956 the National Academy of 552 Sciences (USA) ha d adopted it. Then, within a few years this paradigm \"had transformed 553 governmental regulatory agencies in many countries, including recommendations of the 554 UN.\"107 The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) issued 555 radiation protectio n standards in 1954, which were revised in 1957 and 1958.108 The 1958 556 edition introduced the risk/benefit calculation to the application of ionizing radiation, which 557 later evolved into the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle.109 Despite 558 this, f ormal training in radiation safety was spotty in medicine.110 However , by the time of 559 the Medicare expansion in 1972 the potential hazards of x -rays, even at low, diagnostic 560 doses, had been well -publicized, and should have been known to chiropractors, physicia ns, 561 and legislators involved in the issue. There is evidence that this in fact was known in the 562 medical community; a letter from the Lehigh Valley Committee Against Health Fraud, a 563 group of health professionals including Stephen Barrett, to the United Stat es Senate Finance 564 Committee stated that they considered chiropractic x -rays to be \"window dressing\" and \"a 565 radiation hazard.\"111 This statement acknowledges both the understanding of the potential 566 danger of low levels of ionizing radiation, as well as the fa ct that x -rays should not be used in 567 the absence of clinical justification. In light of the comments above, key figures in both the 568 medical and chiropractic communities did understand the safety issue and spoke out about it. 569 24 It therefore seems more likely that the issue was ignored rather than unknown. 570 Despite concerns, t he attendees at Houston Conference decided to comply with the 571 ACA leadership and tried to find a way to make the new legislation workable. Chiropractor 572 and DACBR James Cox recall ed: \"While I felt apprehension about taking the program [the 573 limited scope of practice as defined in Medicare] as it was... the consensus out of my 574 profession and out of the ACA was that it was the proper step to take, so I supported that, 575 because that's what my prof ession wanted to do .\"112 The DACBR solution was to use 576 various medically recogn ized vertebral displacements and postural scoliosis , calling them \"subluxation\" purely to meet the Medicare 578 requirement of radiographically documenting a positional change in one or more vertebrae in 579 order to justify reimbursement for treatment .113 James Winterstein remember ed: \"ACA 580 developed a \"Medicare Manual\" [the Basic Chiropractic Procedural Manual ] and Joe Howe 581 and I wrote the section on radiography mostly at the kitchen table at my home office in West 582 Chicago, Illinois. In the manual we defined \"subluxation\" and showed examples and drew 583 radiographs from my practice as evidence for the various types of subluxation .\"114 Joseph 584 Howe added: \"We came up with seventeen classifications, which was just foolishness, 585 frankly .\"115 These were political, not clinical definitions of subluxation. The DACBRs and 586 likely the ACA leadership knew that their \"subluxations\" were not the ultimate cau se of 587 disease. Irradiating patients in order to document these subluxations ran counter to the 588 individual risk/benefit appraisal that should have been performed on each patient when 589 considering the use of x -rays. But, c hiropractors were then able to docume nt their \"lesion \" as 590 required by the law. The ACA published the \"subluxations \" in the Manual as well as in other 591 media.116 They also paid for several members to travel around the country giving 592 presentations disseminating the system.117 Some ACA members like J oseph Howe were 593 uncomfortable with the situation, but participated nonetheless: \"Jim Winterstein and I 594 25 developed slides of all those things. We made it up in a carousel [for slide presentation] and 595 we set out, a group of us, to teach that across the world. Something I have regretted ever 596 since .\"118 Chiropractors had found a way to make the legislation workable, although they 597 knew it was ethically questionable. 598 Another potential harm to patients never mentioned by either side is the fact that in a 599 proportion results from any type of diagnostic study there will be an anomalous result, often a 600 false -positive, that requires further investigation. This often causes anxiety and further cost 601 for patients needing additional studies, as was noted in the deb ate around mammography for 602 breast cancer screening.119 603 Even under these dubious circumstances, i nclusion in Medicare was a significant 604 achievement for chiropractic. In 1972, few inroads had been made towards government 605 reimbursement for chiropractic services anywhere in the world, nor were there chiropractors 606 on staff in government hospitals. This ev ent influenced contemporaneous registration and 607 reimbursement inquiries on chiropractic in several countries, but at least one, New Zealand, 608 stated that they \"did not consider the formula applied in USA to be appropriate for their 609 area. \"120 The places where chiropractic has had the best success with integration into 610 government provision of healthcare are Denmark, Switzerland, and Canada. In those 611 countries, chiropractors in subsequent decades decided largely to abandon traditional 612 paradigms. Consequently, the y are reimbursed equivalently with other practitioners. In 613 addition, those countries, and particularly Alberta in Canada, have the highest util ization rates 614 for chiropractic, about twice that of other areas .121 The first government investigation of cost - 615 effectiveness for chiropractic was a study in Canada on low -back pain in 1993; it reported 616 positive findings.122 However, evidence for improve d patient outcomes from chiropractic 617 treatment based on the radiographic demonstration of chiropractic subluxations or p ostural 618 changes has never been documented in a peer -reviewed, indexed journal. 619 26 In 1979 the U.S. House of Representatives held hearings on overexposure to 620 diagnostic x -rays. Herman Olsen, president of the ACA, authored a submission representing 621 both his org anization and the ICA, urging the elimination of the mandate for x -rays. The 622 General Accounting Office, a non -partisan bureau of analysts for the U.S. government, also 623 submitted the following statement regarding the chiropractic x -ray requirement: \"Since t he x- 624 ray serves no medical benefit... the patient is unnecessarily exposed to hazardous radiation 625 solely to fulfil an administrative requirement. The cost of the x -ray can be an expensive 626 burden to the Medicare beneficiary as well. \"123 But, this attempt to cha nge the legislation 627 failed. The x -ray requirement was not removed from the Medicare regulations until 1 January 628 2000, when components of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 were enacted.124 Chiropractors 629 remained reimbursable only for manual manipulation to remo ve spinal \"subluxations ,\" but 630 the subluxations could be documented by means other than x -ray.125 631 CONCLUSION 632 This episode highlights an inherent conflict of interest in professional associations 633 that represent registered healthcare practitioners. Although th e associations are bound to 634 protect and promote the interests of their members, not the public, the boards of professional 635 associations are largely comprised of professionals who are ethically bound to protect the 636 public.126 The events described herein demon strate that the focus by both organ ized 637 chiropractic and organ ized medicine was not solely on public interest but rather more heavily 638 on the interests of their respective professions. It shows the distortion of perspective that may 639 result during a \"turf wa r\", in which two professions fight for, inter alia, public status and 640 healthcare dollars, with inadequate consideration of the patients receiving their services. 641 During this conflict, the stakes were high on both sides. Organ ized medicine framed 642 its positi on as protectors of the public from the \"rabid dogs \" and \"killers \" that were 643 chiropractors.127 Biggs portrayed this episode as a critical junction in the legitim ization and 644 27 economic survival of chiropractic as a profession. Recognition under Medicare raised 645 chiropractic's status and failure to be included would have meant that the cohort of Medicare 646 patients may have gone on to receive services from other practitioners, like 647 physiotherapists.128 But it had negative effects for the profession, as well. It reinforced the 648 traditional chiropractic belief system and it did not conform to radiation safety guidelines.129 649 All the professional associations involved in this battle lost sight of the civic duty that 650 comes with being a healthcare provider. The AMA deci ded to bet that the altering the 651 Medicare legislation would make it useless to chiropractors, but they lost the wager because 652 chiropractors found a way to work within the limits of the legislation. The AMA did not 653 adequately consider the consequences in th e event that they lost. 654 Within chiropractic, the ICA had long promoted the use of x -rays for subluxation 655 analysis, although there was, and still is, little evidence to support that belief. This meant that 656 the scope of the legislation posed no ethical probl em for them, but they were unhappy about 657 the lack of reimbursement. Some c hiropractors in the ACA, though, compromised their 658 values on requiring clinical justification for the use of ionising radiation. The ACA advocated 659 for a system that they did not real ly believe in so that they could gain the political \"win\" of 660 becoming providers for Medicare patients. 661 For its part, the state took the expedient course. Legislators responded to the weight of 662 popularity of chiropractic, rather than clinical evidence for its effectiveness. They also 663 responded to strong emotions attached to the patriotic argument of freedom of choice. At 664 least one Senator has indicated that the change requiring radiography of all chiropractic 665 Medicare patients inserted into the conference c ommittee report was considered insignificant 666 in the scheme of the overall bill.130 Few Senators or Representatives would have been willing 667 to vote against Medicare expansion because of a change to one element in one part of the bill, 668 a large and popular piec e of legislation. 669 28 Both medical and chiropractic professional associations put politics ahead of patients , 670 and the state took a course of compromise, trying to please everyone and ending up pleasing 671 no one . The damage from decades of x -rays being unjustifi ably used on the Medicare 672 population has not been quantified, but is certain to exist . It manifested in several ways: in 673 potential damage to patients' health, the financial cost of x -rays, and by causing stress as well 674 as further diagnostic testing for pat ients with false -positive x -ray results. All parties, 675 including most importantly patients, would have benefitted if those involved in the battle for 676 chiropractic inclusion in Medicare had looked to evidence -based practice paradigms and 677 patient -focused care as their main objectives. 678 679 Notes 680 681 1 This is actually not word for word in the Oath, although the sentiment is.
