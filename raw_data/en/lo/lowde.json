ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder and is the most common mental health disorder during childhood. It can be effectively treated in most cases, and improvement happens most quickly with the combination of medicines and behavior therapy. With ADHD affecting up to 10% of the population, parents and caregivers of adolescents diagnosed with ADHD often have many questions. To help answer some of those most commonly asked, On the Pulse spoke with [Dr. Erin Gonzalez](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/erin-schoenfelder-gonzalez/), Co-Director of the Behavior and Attention Management Program in Seattle Children's [Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/clinics/psychiatry-and-behavioral-medicine/) department.

For many kids in the region, mid-winter break is here, and spring break is only a few months away. Though well-intentioned, interrupted routines can sometimes impact behaviors or cause stress in both children and adults alike. \"In general, we all do better with routines in day-to-day life,\" explained [Dr. Mollie Grow](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/mollie-greves-grow/), a pediatrician at Seattle Children's. \"Structured routines help parents regulate the emotional and functional changes their children undergo as they develop. Routines help children know what to expect as they go through these changes.\" Dr. Grow spoke with On the Pulse to share recommendations to help maintain a sense of structure in the household ahead of the upcoming breaks.

Protect young athletes with pre-sport heart screenings Generally, kids are safe to play sports and exercise without concern for cardiac events, but with all types of sports, it is important to do a physical with family history to identify those who might be at risk.

But unlike most kids his age, Hudson's childhood has been filled with challenges no child should have to experience. Hudson was born with a rare form of [muscular dystrophy](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/musculardystrophy/facts.html) known to affect heart function but didn't experience any cardiac affects until he was 9 years old. Hudson's mom, KaLinda Lewis, said the symptoms started suddenly \u2014 first affecting Hudson's ability to walk and later causing severe stomach pain, dizzy spells, vomiting and even hallucinations. \"We noticed his body was getting weaker,\" she recalled. \"He would take a couple steps and his legs would give out on him.\" KaLinda took Hudson to Seattle Children's [Emergency Department](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/clinics/emergency-department/) where doctors determined that Hudson was in [heart failure](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/conditions/heart-failure/). \"When they said those two words, heart failure, it just blew us away,\" KaLinda said. Janni was a pediatric patient at Seattle Children's At the young age of 12, Tina Janni began suffering from flu-like symptoms over the summer that rapidly escalated into [kidney failure](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/conditions/kidney-failure/). \"I rode in an ambulance from Olympia, WA to Seattle Children's Hospital,\" she explained. Though Janni recalls feeling frightened, a compassionate support system made a significant impact on her family during a deeply difficult time. \"I was fortunate that loneliness was never a complicating issue,\" she said. \"In addition to my parents, I remember nurses, care providers and staff who were a constant and calming presence during the two months I was a patient.\" Janni was diagnosed with a rare [blood for 15-month-old Serigne at Seattle Children's Throughout this season's viral surge, Seattle Children's [Urgent Care](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/clinics/urgent-care-clinic/) team has been hard at work caring for a high volume of patients throughout its four locations in Bellevue, Everett, Federal Way and Seattle. The sites are open 7 days a week, including holidays, and recently expanded their reach by offering [virtual urgent care](https://pulse.seattlechildrens.org/virtual-urgent-care-opens-at-seattle-childrens/) services to all children across the state of Washington. \"We're excited to be launching another way to access Seattle Children's urgent care team, especially at this time where there's so much demand and a need for our services,\" shared [Dr. Jay Santos](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/john-santos/), medical director for Urgent Care at Seattle Children's, in an interview with [KAPP News](https://www.yaktrinews.com/news/health/seattle-children-s-opens-virtual-urgent-care-clinic-for-kids/article_31bb1860-ba1c-57cf-9af2-6f840b1a789d.html).

Jesse Giordano was a pediatric patient at Seattle Children's three decades ago and is now part of its dedicated workforce During a family vacation in 1993 at Lake Chelan, WA, 12-year-old Jesse Giordano started experiencing severe flu-like symptoms and extreme pain in his left arm. \"After a couple days holed up in the motel, my mom took me to an area emergency room,\" Giordano said. \"Other than confirming I had a fever, they told me to follow up with my primary care provider.\" That Monday morning, the family did just that. Giordano was given a blood test and then went home to wait for the results. \"We got a phone call later that day or early Tuesday directing us to Seattle Children's immediately,\" he recalled. \"I was not super worried, but my mom was an absolute wreck.\" The family arrived at Seattle Children's for the appointment in an area now called the Ocean zone. At the appointment, doctors conducted a [Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/globalassets/documents/for-patients-and-families/pfe/pe017.pdf) and found something "}
