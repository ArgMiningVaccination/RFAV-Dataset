However, grandfathered health plans must comply with certain other consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act, for example, the elimination of lifetime limits on benefits.

UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT Utilization management is designed to assist covered persons in making informed medical care decisions resulting in the delivery of appropria te levels of Plan benefits for each proposed course of treatment. These decisions are based on the medical information provided by the patient and the patient's physician . The patient and his or her physician determine the course of treatment. The assist ance provided through these services does not constitute the practice of medicine. Payment of Plan benefits is not determined through these processes. The Plan Manager (Humana) does not reward doctors and other individuals for denying coverage or withh olding services. Financial incentives are never offered. In fact, utilization management actually helps the Plan Manager (Humana) make sure you get the preventive care and medically necessary services you need. You may request a review of the medical ne cessity and appropriateness of hospital resources and medical services given or proposed to be given to you for purposes of determining the availability of payment, referred to as a utilization review. HEALTH RESOURCES (continued) 14 Additionally, you may request an internal appeal of the coverage decision within sixty (60) days of receiving notice of the decision if the decision involves a denial, reduction or termination of a benefit or the denial of payment for a service . Just call Customer Service at the number on your identifi cation card to find out how. Finally, you may also request an external review to be conducted by a certified independent review entity at the cost of the Plan if you have completed the internal appeal process and meet other conditions. Utilization review includes precertification and concurrent review . This provision will not provide benefits to cover a confinement or service which is not medically necessary or otherwise would not be covered under the Plan . Precertification is not a g uarantee of coverage. If you or your covered dependent s are to receive a service which requires precertification , your qualified practitioner must contact the Plan Manager (Humana) by telephone or in writing. After your qualified practitioner has provi ded the Plan Manager (Humana) with your diagnosis and treatment plan, the Plan Manager (Humana) will: 1 Advise you in writing if the proposed treatment plan is medically necessary ; 2. Advise you in writing the number of days the confinement is initially precertified ; and 3. Conduct concurrent review as necessary. If your qualified practitioner extends your confinement beyond the number of days initially precertified , the extension must be precertified through concurrent review . If it is determined at any time your proposed treatment plan, either partially or totally, is not a covered expense under the terms and provisions of the Plan , benefits for services may be reduced or services may not be covered. Penalty for Not Obtaining Precertification If your qualified practitioner does not obtain precertification for services being rendered, your benefits for hospital or qualified treatment facility may be reduced. PRECERTIFICATION 15 There are certain services that may require precertification . Plea se contact your qualified practitioner or Humana before services are performed. It is recommended that you call the toll -free customer service phone number on the back of your ID card as soon as possible to receive proper precertification . PREDETERMINATION OF BENEFITS You or your qualified practitioner may submit a written request for a predetermination of benefits . The written request should contain the treatment plan, specific diagnostic and procedure codes, as we ll as the expected charges. Humana will provide a written response advising if the services are a covered or non - covered expense under this Plan , what the applicable Plan benefits are and if the expected charges are within the maximum allowable fee . The predetermination of benefits is not a guarantee of benefits. Services will be subject to all terms and provisions of this Plan applicable at the time treatment is provided. If treatment is to commence more than 90 days after the date treatment is authori zed, Humana will require you to submit another treatment plan. 16 SECTION 2 MEDICAL BENEFITS UNDERSTANDING YOUR COVERAGE 17 PARTICIPATING AND NON -PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS This Plan has two (2) level s of benefits - participating provider (PAR provider) benefits and non- participating provider (Non -PAR provider) benefits, payable as shown in the Schedule of Benefits section. You may select any provider to provide your medical care.

You are responsible for any applicable deductibles and coinsurance amounts. If you receive services from a Non-PAR provider , this Plan will pay benefits at a lower percentage and you will pay a larger share of the costs. Since Non-PAR providers do not have contractual arrangements with Humana to accept discounted or negotiated fees, they may bill you for charges in ex cess of the maximum allowable fee . You are responsible for charges in excess of the maximum allowable fee in addition to any applicable deductibles and coinsurance amounts. Any amount you pay to the provider in excess of your coinsurance will not apply t o your out-of-pocket limit or deductible .

If services are provid ed to you by such facility based Non-PAR qualified practitioners at a PAR hospital, this Plan will pay for those services at the PAR provider benefit percentage. Facility based Non-PAR qualified practitioners may require payment from you for any amount no t paid by this Plan. If possible, you may want to verify whether services are available from a PAR qualified practitioner. In the event that a specific medical service cannot be provided by or through a PAR provider , a covered person is entitled to cover age for medically necessary covered expenses obtained through a Non-PAR provider when approved by this Plan on a case by case basis. PAR PROVIDER DIRECTORY DEI will automatically provide, without charge, information to you about how you can access a di rectory of PAR providers appropriate to your service area.

The bene fit payable for covered expenses will not exceed the maximum allowable fee(s) . A covered expense is deemed to be incurred on the date a covered service is received. The bill submitted by the provider , if any, will determine which benefit provision is app licable for payment of covered expenses . If you incur non -covered expenses , whether from a PAR provider or a Non-PAR provider , you are responsible for making the full payment to the provider . The fact that a provider has performed or prescribed a medical ly appropriate procedure, treatment, or supply, or the fact that it may be the only available treatment for a bodily injury or sickness does not mean that the procedure, treatment or supply is covered under this Plan .

NOTE: These limitations and exclusions apply even if a qualified practitioner has performed or prescribed a medically necessary procedure, treatment or supply. This does not prevent your qualified practitioner from providing or perfo rming the procedure, treatment or supply, however, the procedure, treatment or supply will not be a covered expense . COORDINATION OF BENEFITS 75 BENEFITS SUBJECT TO THIS PROVISION Benefits described in this Plan are coordinated with benefits provide d by other plans under which you are also covered. This is to prevent duplication of coverage and a resulting increase in the cost of medical coverage. For this purpose, a plan is one which covers medical or dental expenses and provides benefits or servi ces by group, franchise or blanket insurance coverage. This includes group -type contracts not available to the general public, obtained and maintained only because of the covered person's membership in, or connection with, a particular organization or gro up, whether or not designated as franchise, blanket, or in some other fashion. Plan also includes any coverage provided through the following: 1. Employer, trustee, union, employee benefit, or other association; or 2. Governmental programs, programs mandated by state statute, or sponsored or provided by an educational institution. This Coordination of Benefits provision does not apply to any individual policies or Blanket Student Accident Insurance provided by, or through, an educational institution. Allowab le expense means any eligible expense , a portion of which is covered under one of the plans covering the person for whom claim is made. Each plan will determine what is an allowable expense according to the provisions of the respective plan. When a plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be deemed to be both an allowable expense and a benefit paid. EFFECT ON BENEFITS One of the plans involved will pay benefits firs t. This is called the primary plan. All other plans are called secondary plans. When this Plan is the secondary plan, the sum of the benefit payable will not exceed 100% of the total allowable expenses incurred under this Plan and any other plans includ ed under this provision. ORDER OF BENEFIT DET ERMINATION In order to pay claims , it must be determined which plan is primary and which plan(s) are secondary. A plan will pay benefits first if it meets one of the following conditions: 1. The plan has no coo rdination of benefits provision; 2. The plan covers the person as an employee ; 3. For a child who is covered under both parents' plans, the plan covering the parent whose birthday (month and day) occurs first in the calendar year pays before the plan covering the other parent. If the birthdates of both parents are the same, the plan which has covered the person for the longer period of time will be determined the primary plan; If a plan other than this Plan does not include provision 3, then the gender rule (male pays primary) will be followed to determine which plan is primary. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) 76 4. In the case of dependent children covered under the plans of divorced or separated parents, the following rules apply: a. The plan of a parent who has custody will pay the benefits firs t; b. The plan of a step -parent who has custody will pay benefits next; c. The plan of a parent who does not have custody will pay benefits next; d. The plan of a step -parent who does not have custody will pay benefits next. There may be a court decree which gives one parent financial responsibility for the medical or dental expenses of the dependent children. If there is a court decree, the rules stated above will not apply if they conflict with the court decree. Instead, the plan of the parent with financial re sponsibility will pay benefits first. 5. If a person is laid off or is retired or is a dependent of such person, that plan covers after the plan covering such person as an active employee or dependent of such employee . If the other plan does not have this r ule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule will be ignored. If the above rules do not apply or cannot be determined, then the plan that covered the person for the longest period of time will pay first. COORDINATI ON OF BENEFITS WITH MEDICARE TRICARE AS SECONDARY PAYER Generally, TRICARE is intended to be the secondary payer to health benefit, insurance, and third -party plans. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1079(j)(1); 32 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 and (b). When TRICARE is secondary, a be nefit may not be paid under TRICARE if a person is enrolled in, or covered by, any other insurance, medical service, or health plan, including any plan offered by a third -party payer, to the extent that the benefit is also a benefit under the other plan. I n the case of individuals with health coverage through their current employment, the employer insurance plan shall be the first payer, Medicare shall be the second payer, and TRICARE shall be the third payer. For example, if an individual is covered by TRICARE and also by an employer -sponsored plan, and a particular treatment or procedure is covered by both, the employer - sponsored plan must pay first. The TRICARE rules prohibit employers from providing financial or other incentives for a TRICARE eligible employee not to enroll (or to terminate enrollment) under a health plan that would (in the case of such enrollment) be a primary plan. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1097c(a)(1); DoD Reg. \u00a7 199.8(d)(6), 75 Fed. Reg. 18051 (Apr. 9, 2010). This plan is compliant with 10 U. S.C. \u00a7 1097c and 32 CFR \u00a7 199.8. When an employer employs 100 or more persons, the benefits of this Plan will be payable first for a covered person who is under age 65 and eligible for Medicare . The benefits of Medicare will be payable second. MEDICARE PART A means the Social Security program that provides hospital insurance benefits. MEDICARE PART B means the Social Security program that provides medical insurance benefits. A covered person is considered to be eligible for Medicare on the earliest dat e coverage under Medicare could become effective for him or her. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) 77 OPTIONS Federal Law allows this Plan's actively working covered employees age 65 or older and their covered spouses who are eligible for Medicare to choose one of the following options: OPTION 1 - The benefits of this Plan will be payable first and the benefits of Medicare will be payable second. OPTION 2 - Medicare benefits only. The covered person and his or her dependents , if any, will not be covered by this Plan. Each covered emplo yee and each covered spouse will be provided with the choice to elect one of these options at least one month before the covered employee or the covered spouse becomes age 65. All new covered employees and newly covered spouses age 65 or older will also b e offered these options. If Option 1 is chosen, its issue is subject to the same requirements as for a covered employee or dependent who is under age 65. Under Federal law, there are two categories of persons eligible for Medicare . The calculation and payments of benefits by this Plan differs for each category. CATEGORY 1 - Medicare Eligibles are actively working covered employees age 65 or older and their age 65 or older covered spouses, and age 65 or older covered spouses of actively working covered employees who are under age 65. CATEGORY 2 - Medicare Eligibles are any other covered persons entitled to Medicare , whether or not they enrolled for it. This category includes, but is not limited to, retired covered employees and their spouses or covered dependents of a covered employee other than his or her spouse. CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF BENEFITS For covered persons in Category 1, benefits are payable by this Plan without regard to any benefits payable by Medicare . Medicare will then determine its benefits. For covered persons in Category 2, Medicare benefits are payable before any benefits are payable by this Plan. The benefits of this Plan will then be reduced by the full amount of all Medicare benefits the covered person received RIGHT OF REC OVERY This Plan reserves the right to recover benefit payments made for an allowable expense under this Plan in the amount which exceeds the maximum amount this Plan is required to pay under these provisions. This right of recovery applies to this Plan against: 1. Any person(s) to, for or with respect to whom, such payments were made; or 2. Any other insurance companies, or organizations which according to these provisions, owe benefits due for the same allowable expense under any other plan. This Plan alone will determine against whom this right of recovery will be exercised. HEALTH CARE CLA IM PROCEDURES 78 SUBMITTING A CLAIM This section describes what a covered person (or his or her authorized representative) must do to file a claim for Plan benef its. A claim must be filed with Humana in writing and delivered to Humana by mail, postage prepaid, or by e -mail. However, a submission to obtain pre -authorization may also be filed with Humana by telephone; Claims must be submitted to Humana at the ad dress indicated in the documents describing this Plan or claimant's identification card. Claims will not be deemed submitted for purposes of these procedures unless and until received at the correct address; Also, claims submissions must be in a format acceptable to Humana and compliant with any applicable legal requirements. Claims that are not submitted in accordance with the requirements of applicable federal law respecting privacy of protected health information and/or electronic claims standards wi ll not be accepted by this Plan ; Claims submissions must be timely. Claims must be filed as soon as reasonably possible after they are incurred, and in no event later than 15 months after the date of loss, except if you were legally incapacitated. Plan benefits are only available for claims that are incurred by a covered person during the period that he or she is covered under this Plan; Claims submissions must be complete. They must contain, at a minimum: a. The name of the covered person who incurred t he covered expense ; b. The name and address of the health care provider ; c. The diagnosis of the condition; d. The procedure or nature of the treatment; e. The date of and place where the procedure or treatment has been or will be provided; f. The amount billed and the a mount of the covered expense not paid through coverage other than Plan coverage, as appropriate; g. Evidence that substantiates the nature, amount, and timeliness of each covered expense in a format that is acceptable according to industry standards and in co mpliance with applicable law. A general request for an interpretation of Plan provisions will not be considered to be a claim . Requests of this type, such as a request for an interpretation of the eligibility provisions of this Plan , should be directed to the Plan Administrator . Mail medical claims and correspondence to: Humana Claims Office P.O. Box 146 01 Lexington, KY 40512 -4601 HEALTH CARE CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 79 MISCELLANEOUS MEDICAL CHARGES If you accumulate bills for medical items you purchase or rent yourself , send them to Hu mana at least once every three months during the year (quarterly). The receipts must include the patient name, name of the item, date item was purchased or rented and name of the provider of service . PROCEDURAL DEFECTS If a pre-service claim submission is not made in accordance with this Plan 's procedural requirements, Humana will notify the claimant of the procedural deficiency and how it may be cured no later than within five (5) days (or within 24 hours, in the case of an urgent care claim ) following the failure. A post-service claim that is not submitted in accordance with these claims procedures will be returned to the submitter. ASSIGNMENTS AND REPR ESENTATIVES A covered person may assign his or her right to receive Plan benefits to a health care provider only with the consent of Humana, in its sole discretion, except as may be required by applicable law. Assignments must be in writing. If a document is not sufficient to constitute an assignment, as determined by Humana, then this Plan will not c onsider an assignment to have been made. An assignment is not binding on this Plan until Humana receives and acknowledges in writing the original or copy of the assignment before payment of the benefit. If benefits are assigned in accordance with the for egoing paragraph and a health care provider submits claims on behalf of a covered person , benefits will be paid to that health care provider . In addition, a covered person may designate an authorized representative to act on his or her behalf in pursuing a benefit claim or appeal. The designation must be explicitly stated in writing and it must authorize disclosure of protected health information with respect to the claim by this Plan , Humana and the authorized representative to one another. If a documen t is not sufficient to constitute a designation of an authorized representative, as determined by Humana, then this Plan will not consider a designation to have been made. An assignment of benefits does not constitute designation of an authorized represen tative. Any document designating an authorized representative must be submitted to Humana in advance, or at the time an authorized representative commences a course of action on behalf of a claimant . At the same time, the authorized representative should also provide notice of commencement of the action on behalf of the claimant to the claimant , which Humana may verify with the claimant prior to recognizing the authorized representative status. In any event, a health care provider with knowledge of a claimant's medical condition acting in connection with an urgent care claim will be recognized by this Plan as the claimant's authorized representative. Covered persons should carefully consider whether to designate an authorized representative. An authoriz ed representative may make decisions independent of the covered person , such as whether and how to appeal a claim denial. HEALTH CARE CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 80 CLAIMS DECISIONS After submission of a claim by a claimant , Humana will notify the claimant within a reasonable time, as follows: Pre-Service Claims Humana will notify the claimant of a favorable or adverse determination within a reasonable time appropriate to the medical circumstances, but no later than 15 days after receipt of the claim by this Plan . However, this period may be extended by an additional 15 days, if Humana determines that the extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of this Plan . Humana will notify the affected claimant of the extension before the end of the initial 15 -day period, the circumstance s requiring the extension, and the date by which this Plan expects to make a decision. If the reason for the extension is because of the claimant's failure to submit information necessary to decide the claim , the notice of extension will describe the req uired information. The claimant will have at least 45 days from the date the notice is received to provide the specified information. Urgent Care Claims Humana will determine whether a claim is an urgent care claim . This determination will be made on t he basis of information furnished by or on behalf of a claimant . In making this determination, Humana will exercise its judgment, with deference to the judgment of a physician with knowledge of the claimant's condition. Accordingly, Humana may require a claimant to clarify the medical urgency and circumstances that support the urgent care claim for expedited decision -making. Humana will notify the claimant of a favorable or adverse determination as soon as possible, taking into account the medical urgenc y particular to the claimant's situation, but not later than 72 hours after receipt of the urgent care claim by this Plan . However, if a claim is submitted that does not provide sufficient information to determine whether, or to what extent, expenses are covered or payable under this Plan , notice will be provided by Humana as soon as possible, but not more than 24 hours after receipt of the urgent care claim by this Plan . The notice will describe the specific information necessary to complete the claim . The claimant will have a reasonable amount of time, taking into account his or her circumstances, to provide the necessary information but not less than 48 hours. Humana will notify the claimant of this Plan's urgent care claim determination as soon as possible, but in no event more than 48 hours after the earlier of: 1. This Plan's receipt of the specified information; or 2. The end of the period afforded the claimant to provide the specified additional information. HEALTH CARE CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 81 Concurrent Care Decisions Humana wi ll notify a claimant of a concurrent care decision that involves a reduction in or termination of benefits that have been pre -authorized. Humana will provide the notice sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow the claimant to appea l and obtain a determination on review of the adverse determination before the benefit is reduced or terminated. A request by a claimant to extend a course of treatment beyond the period of time or number of treatments that is a claim involving urgent car e will be decided by Humana as soon as possible, taking into account the medical urgency. Humana will notify a claimant of the benefit determination, whether adverse or not within 24 hours after receipt of the claim by this Plan , provided that the claim is submitted to this Plan at least 24 hours prior to the expiration of the prescribed period of time or number of treatments. Post-Service Claims Humana will notify the claimant of a favorable or adverse determination within a reasonable time, but not later than 30 days after receipt of the claim by this Plan . However, this period may be extended by an additional 15 days if Humana determines that the extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of this Plan . Humana will notify the affected claimant of the extension before the end of the initial 30 -day period, the circumstances requiring the extension, and the date by which this Plan expects to make a decision. If the reason for the extension is because of the claimant's failure to submit in formation necessary to decide the claim , the notice of extension will describe the required information. The claimant will have at least 45 days from the date the notice is received to provide the specified information. Humana will make a decision no lat er than 15 days after the earlier of the date on which the information provided by the claimant is received by this Plan or the expiration of the time allowed for submission of the additional information. TIMES FOR DECISIONS The periods of time for claim s decisions presented above begin when a claim is received by this Plan , in accordance with these claims procedures. PAYMENT OF CLAIMS Many health care providers will request an assignment of benefits as a matter of convenience to both provider and patie nt. Also as a matter of convenience, Humana will, in its sole discretion, assume that an assignment of benefits has been made to certain Network Providers . In those instances, Humana will make direct payment to the hospital , clinic or physician's office, unless Humana is advised in writing that you have already paid the bill. If you have paid the bill, please indicate on the original statement, \"paid by employee, \" and send it directly to Humana . You will receive a written explanation of an adverse deter mination . Humana reserves the right to request any information required to determine benefits or process a claim . You or the provider of services will be contacted if additional information is needed to process your claim . HEALTH CARE CLAIM PROCEDURES (conti nued) 82 When an employee's child is su bject to a medical child support order, Humana will make reimbursement of eligible expenses paid by you, the child, the child's non -employee custodial parent, or legal guardian, to that child or the child's custodial parent, or legal guardian, or as provid ed in the medical child support order. Payment of benefits under this Plan will be made in accordance with an assignment of rights for you and your dependents as required under state Medicaid law. Benefits payable on behalf of you or your covered depende nt after death will be paid, at this Plan's option, to any family member(s) or your estate. Humana will rely upon an affidavit to determine benefit payment, unless it receives written notice of valid claim before payment is made. The affidavit will relea se this Plan from further liability. Any payment made by Humana in good faith will fully discharge it to the extent of such payment. Payments due under this Plan will be paid upon receipt of written proof of loss. INITIAL DENIAL NOTICES Notice of a claim denial (including a partial denial) will be provided to claimants by mail, postage prepaid, or by e -mail, as appropriate, within the time frames noted above. However, notices of adverse decisions involving urgent care claims may be provided to a claim ant orally within the time frames noted above for expedited urgent care claim decisions. If oral notice is given, written notification will be provided to the claimant no later than 3 days after the oral notification. A claims denial notice will state th e specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination , the specific Plan provisions on which the determination is based, and a description of this Plan's review procedures and associated timeline. The notice will also include a description of any add itional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary. The notice will describe this Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures. The notice will also disclose any internal Plan rule, protocol or similar criterion that was relied on to deny the claim . A copy of the rule, protocol or similar criterion relied upon will be provided to a claimant free of charge upon request. If the adverse determination is based on medical necessity, experimental, investigational or for research purposes, or similar exclusion or limit, the notice will provide either an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the determination, applyin g the terms of this Plan to the claimant's medical circumstances, or a statement that such explanation will be provided free of charge upon request. In the case of an adverse decision of an urgent care claim , the notice will provide a description of this Plan's expedited review procedures applicable to such claims . HEALTH CARE CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 83 APPEALS / GRIEVANCES If your medical claims have been denied, you have the right to file an appeal or grievance to Humana.

REIMBURSEMENT OF HRA FUNDS Only medical care expenses that have not been or will not be reimbursed by any other source may be Eligible Medical Expenses (to the extent all other conditions for Eligib le Medical Expenses have been satisfied). As such, this HRA does not coordinate benefits with any other group or individual health coverage except as provided herein. \"HRA Eligible Medical Expenses\" are medical care expenses incurred by you or your eligible Dependents that satisfy all of the conditions described below. All expenses that are not within the scope of \"HRA Eligible Medical Expenses\" described below are excluded. Eligible Medical Expenses covered under this HRA Plan must also be covered under the Commonwealth Maximum Choice. The following expenses are eligible for reimbursement under this HRA Plan (provided all other terms and conditions of the HRA have been satisfied): Medical Preventive Health Care Prescriptions Over the Counter Medications Vision Dental Durable Medical Equipment HEALTH CARE CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 87 \"Incurred\" means the date the service or treatment is provided; not when the expense arising from the service or treatment is paid. Thus, an expense that has been paid but not incurred (e.g. pre -payment to a physi cian) will not be reimbursed until the services or treatment giving rise to the expense has been provided. In no event will the following expenses be eligible for reimbursement: Any expense that is not a Code Section 213(d) expense Any expenses incurred for qualified long term care services Expenses incurred prior to the date that coverage under this HRA becomes effective Expenses incurred after the date that coverage under this HRA ends Expenses that have been reimbursed by another plan or for which plan to seek reimbursement under another health plan. To the extent that Eligible Medical Expenses are covered both by this HRA and by an Employer sponsored FSA in which the employee participates, Eligible Medical Expenses are first reimbursed from the FS A and then the HRA. CLAIM REIMBURSEMENT Under this HRA, you have two reimbursement options. You can complete and submit a written claim for reimbursement (see \"Traditional Paper Claims\" below for more information). Alternatively, you can use an electr onic payment card (see \"Electronic Payment Card\" below for more information) to pay the expense. In order to be eligible for the Electronic Payment Card, you must agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the Electronic Payment Card Program (the \"Prog ram\") as set forth herein and in the Electronic Payment Cardholder Agreement (the \"Cardholder Agreement\") including limitations as to card usage, the Plan 's right to withhold and offset for ineligible claims, etc. The following is a summary of how both op tions work. HRA claim is deemed filed when it is received by the Third Party Administrator. If your claim for reimbursement is approved, you will be provided reimbursement as soon as reasonably possible following the determination. In some instances, your insurer (if Humana) may submit the EOB on your behalf. In that situation, you certify when you incur the expense that the expense has not been reimbursed by any other source and that you will not seek reimbursement from any other source. You may subm it requests for reimbursement of Eligible Medical Expenses at any time prior to the end of the HRA Run Out Period. The HRA Run Out Period for active employees is 90 days after the end of the plan year . If it is later determined that you and/or your eligible Dependent(s) received an overpayment or a payment was made in error (e.g., you were reimbursed for an expense under the HRA that is later paid for by the Commonwealth Maximum Choice or some other medical plan), you will be required to refund the overpa yment or erroneous reimbursement to the HRA. If you do not refund the overpayment or erroneous payment, the Plan reserves the right to offset future reimbursement equal to the overpayment or erroneous payment or, if that is not feasible, to withhold such funds from your pay. If all other attempts to recoup the overpayment/erroneous payment are unsuccessful, the Plan Administrator may treat the overpayment as a bad debt, which may have income tax implications for you. In addition, if the Plan Administrato r determines that you have submitted a fraudulent claim, the Plan Administrator may terminate your coverage under this HRA (and to the extent permissible, under the Commonwealth Maximum Choice ). HEALTH CARE CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 88 Traditional Paper Claims When you incur an Eligible Medical Expense, you file a claim with the Plan's Third Party Administrator by completing and mailing or faxing a Request for Reimbursement Form. Forms can be mailed to PO Box 14167, Lexington, KY 40512 -4167 or faxed to 1 -800-905-1851. You may obtain a Request for Reimbursement Form from the Third Party Administrator or print a copy from the KEHP website at http://kehp.ky.gov . You must include with your Request for Reimbursement Form a written statement from an independent third party (e.g., a receipt, EOB, etc .) associated with each expense that indicates the following: (i) The nature of the expense (e.g. what type of service or treatment was provided). (ii) The date the expense was incurred; and (iii) The amount of the expense. The Third Party Administrator will process the claim once it receives the Request for Reimbursement Form from you. Reimbursement for expenses that are determined to be Eligible Medical Expenses will be made as soon as possible after receiving the claim and processing it. If the expen se is determined to not be an Eligible Medical Expense, you will receive notification of this determination. You must submit all claims for reimbursement for Eligible Medical Expenses during the Plan Year in which they were incurred or during the Run Out Period. Electronic Payment Card The Electronic Payment Card allows you to pay for Eligible Medical Expenses at the time that you incur the expense. 1. In order to be eligible for the Electronic Payment Card, you must agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the Program as set forth herein and in the Electronic Payment Cardholder Agreement (the \"Cardholder Agreement\") including limitations as to card usage, the Plan 's right to withhold and offset for ineligible claims, etc. You must agree to ab ide by the terms of the Program both during the Initial Election Period and during each Annual Election Period. A Cardholder Agreement will be provided to you. The Cardholder Agreement is part of the terms and conditions of your Plan and this SPD. 2. The card will be turned off when employment or coverage terminates. The card will be turned off if you fail to provide the correct documentation to Humana, when necessary to substantiate claims. If Humana does not receive substantiation (verification) from you within thirty (30) days after you swipe the Humana Access Card, then Humana will request this substantiation from you. If substantiation is not received within thirty (30) more days (for a total of sixty (60) days from the initial Humana Access Card s wipe), then claims processing will be suspended. This suspension of claims will include the use of the Humana Access Card as well as reimbursements for traditional paper claims. The card will be turned off when you terminate employment or when coverage under the Plan ends. Contact your Third Party Administrator for reactivation of the electronic payment card if you elect COBRA, and after submission of your initial COBRA premium payment. HEALTH CARE CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 89 3. You must certify proper use of the card. As specified in the Car dholder Agreement, you certify during the applicable Election Period that the amounts in your HRA will only be used for Eligible Medical Expenses ( e.g. medical care expenses incurred by you, your spouse , and your tax dependents) and that you have not been reimbursed for the expense and that you will not seek reimbursement for the expense from any other source. Failure to abide by this certification will result in termination of card use privileges. 4. HRA reimbursement under the card is limited to certain providers. Use of the card for HRA expenses is limited to merchants who are providers such as doctors and pharmacies. 5. You swipe the card at the health care provider like you do any other credit card. When you incur an Eligible Medical Expense at a d octor's office or pharmacy, such as a co -payment or prescription drug expense, you swipe the card at the provider's office much like you would a typical credit card. The provider is paid for the expense up to the maximum reimbursement amount available und er the HRA (or as otherwise limited by the Program) at the time that you swipe the card. Every time you swipe the card, you certify to the Plan that the expense for which payment under the HRA is being made is an Eligible Medical Expense and that you have not been reimbursed from any other source nor will you seek reimbursement from another source. 6. You must obtain and retain a receipt/third party statement each time you swipe the card. You must obtain a third party statement from the health care provid er (e.g., receipt, invoice, etc.) that includes the following information each time you swipe the card: The nature of the expense (e.g., what type of service or treatment was provided). If the expense is for an over the counter drug, the written statemen t must indicate the name of the drug. The date the expense was incurred. The amount of the expense. You must retain this receipt for one year following the close of the Plan year in which the expense is incurred. Even though payment is made under the ca rd arrangement, you may be required to submit a written third party statement (except as otherwise provided in the Cardholder Agreement). You will receive a letter from the Claims Administrator that a third party statement is needed. You must provide the third party statement to the Claims Administrator within 45 days (or such longer period provided in the letter from the Claims Administrator) of the request. 7. There may be situations in which you will not be required to provide the written statement to the claims administrator. More detail as to which situations apply under your Plan is specified in the Cardholder Agreement. Co-Pay Match: As specified in the Cardholder Agreement, no written statement is necessary if the Electronic Payment Card paym ent matches a specific co -payment you have under the Commonwealth Maximum Choice for the particular service that was provided. For example, if you have a $10 co -pay for physician office visits, and the payment was made to a physician office in the amount of $10, you will not be required to provide the third party statement to the Claims Administrator. HEALTH CARE CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 90 Previously Approved Claim Match: As specified in the Cardholder Agreement, no written statement is required if the expense is the same as the amount, durat ion and provider as a previously approved expense. For example, the claims administrator approves a thirty (30) count prescription with 3 refills that was purchased at ABC Pharmacy. Each time the card is swiped for subsequent refills at ABC Pharmacy the receipt need not be provided to the Claims Administrator if the expense incurred is the same amount Provider Match Program: As specified in the Cardholder Agreement, no third party statement is required to be submitted to the Claims Administrator if the el ectronic claim file is accompanied by an electronic or written confirmation from the health care provider (e.g., your prescription benefits manager) that identifies the nature of your expense and verifies the amount. Note: You should still obtain the thir d party receipt when you incur an expense and swipe the card, even if you think it will not be needed, in the event the receipt is requested by the Claims Administrator. 8. Pay at the pharmacy with your Visa Humana Access Card. Here are the steps to take when paying at the pharmacy: When you pick up your prescription, present your primary insurance card so your pharmacist can identify your copayment amount and bill your insurer. Ask your pharmacist to follow the instructions on the Humana Access card to su bmit a second claim to Humana, which takes only a few minutes. Then swipe your Humana Access card through the credit card machine, to make the payment. Select \"credit\" - not \"debit\" - for your transaction. Sign and save the receipt. To find a complete list of participating pharmacies, please visit kyhealthplan.com. 9. You must pay back any improperly paid claims. If you are unable to provide adequate or timely substantiation as requested by the Claims Administrator, you must repay the Plan for the unsubst antiated expense. The deadline for repaying the Plan is set forth in the Cardholder Agreement. If you do not repay the Plan within the applicable time period, the card will be turned off and an amount equal to the unsubstantiated expense may be offset ag ainst future eligible claims under the HRA. The Plan further reserves the right to withhold the amount of any unsubstantiated expenses from your paycheck and to take any additional steps deemed necessary to properly account for any unsubstantiated expense s. 10. You can use either the payment card or the traditional paper claims approach. You have the choice as to how to submit your eligible claims. If you elect not to use the electronic payment card, you may also submit claims under the Traditional Paper Cl aims approach discussed above. Claims for which the Electronic Payment Card has been used cannot be submitted as Traditional Paper Claims. HEALTH CARE CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 91 11. This plan reserves the right to initiate the following correction procedures to recoup money from participants for claims that are improperly paid from the health HRA ( e.g., a claim that qualifies for after -the-fact-substantiation for which proper substantiation is not subsequently provided). Deny Access to the Card . To ensure that no further violations occur, the car d must be deactivated until the amount of the improper payment is recovered. In the meantime, the participant must request reimbursements through other methods (e.g., by submitting traditional paper claims). Require Repayment . The employer may \"demand\" th at the participant repay the improper payment. A letter to the participant will be sent identifying the amount, the reasons for requiring repayment, and the timeframe in which the repayment must be made. Withhold From Pay . If the demand for repayment is unsuccessful, then an amount equal to the improper payment must be withheld from the participant's pay or other compensation, to the full extent permitted under applicable law. Offset . If the improper payment is still outstanding and amounts are not avai lable to be withheld, then the employer is to apply a substitution or offset approach against subsequent valid claims, up to the amount of the improper payment. Treat Payment as Other Business Indebtedness. If the above correction efforts prove unsuccessf ul, then the employee remains indebted to the employer for the amount of the improper payment. In that event, and consistent with its business practices, the employer may treat the payment as it would treat any other business indebtedness. MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT The maximum reimbursement amount that you can receive is equal to your Health Reimbursement Account balance at the time the request for reimbursement is processed. Any portion of a claim for reimbursement that exceeds the maximum reimbur sement amount will be suspended and processed when the Reimbursement Account becomes sufficient. Pended claims will be processed and, if appropriate, paid before any new claims are processed and paid. DENIED CLAIMS If your claim for benefits is denied, you will have the right to a full and fair review process. HEALTH CARE CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 92 CLAIMS REVIEW PROCEDURE CHART The Plan has established the following claims review procedure in the event you are denied a benefit under this Plan . Step 1: Notice is received from Third Par ty Administrator. If your claim is denied, you will receive written notice from the Third Party Administrator that your claim is denied as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 30 days after receipt of the claim. For reasons beyond the control of the Third Party Administrator, the Third Party Administrator may take up to an additional 15 days to review your claim. You will be provided written notice of the need for additional time prior to the end of the 30 -day period. If the reason for the additi onal time is that you need to provide additional information, you will have 45 days from the notice of the extension to obtain that information. The time period during which the Third Party Administrator must make a decision will be suspended until the ear lier of the date that you provide the information or the end of the 45 -day period. Step 2: Review your notice carefully. Once you have received your notice from the Third Party Administrator, review it carefully. The notice will contain: The reason(s) f or the denial and the Plan provisions on which the denial is based; A description of any additional information necessary for you to perfect your claim, why the information is necessary, and your time limit for submitting the information; A description of the Plan 's appeal procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures; and A right to request all documentation relevant to your claim. Step 3: If you disagree with the decision, file an Appeal. If you do not agree with the decision of the Third Party Administrator and you wish to appeal, you must file your appeal no later than 180 days after receipt of the notice described in Step 1. You should submit all information identified in the notice of denial as necessary to perfect your claim and any additional information that you believe would support your claim. Step 4: Notice of Denial is received from Third Party Administrator. If the claim is again denied, you will be notified in writing as soon as possible but no later than 30 days after rece ipt of the appeal by the Third Party Administrator. Step 5: Review your notice carefully. You should take the same action that you took in Step 2 described above. The notice will contain the same type of information that is provided in the first notice of denial provided by the Third Party Administrator. Step 6: If you still disagree with the Third Party Administrator's decision, file a 2nd Level Appeal with the Plan Administrator . If you still do not agree with the Third Party Administrator's decision and you wish to appeal, you must file a written appeal with the Plan Administrator within the time period set forth in the first level appeal denial notice from the Third Party Administrator. You should gather any additional information that is identifie d in the notice as necessary to perfect your claim and any other information that you believe would support your claim. If the Plan Administrator denies your 2nd Level Appeal, you will receive notice within 30 days after the Plan Administrator receives y our claim. The notice will contain the same type of information that was referenced in Step 1 above. HEALTH CARE CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 93 Other important information regarding your appeals Each level of appeal will be independent from the previous level ( e.g., the same person(s) or subordin ates of the same person(s) involved in a prior level of appeal will not be involved in the appeal); On each level of appeal, the claims reviewer will review relevant information that you submit even if it is new information; and You cannot file suit in fed eral court until you have exhausted these appeals procedures. MISCELLANEOUS RIGHTS UNDER THE HRA Continue Group Health Plan Coverage You may continue health care coverage for yourself, Spouse or Dependent children if there is a loss of coverage under t he Plan as a result of a qualifying event . You or your eligible Dependents will have to pay for such coverage. You should review the relevant sections of the HRA Summary for more information concerning your COBRA continuation coverage rights. You may be e ligible for a reduction or elimination of exclusionary periods of coverage for preexisting condition under your group health plan, if you move to another plan and you have creditable coverage from this Plan . If you are eligible for this reduction or elimin ation, you will be provided a certificate of creditable coverage, free of charge, from the Plan when you lose coverage under the Plan , when you become entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage, when your COBRA continuation coverage ceases, if you reque st it before losing coverage, or if you request it up to 24 months after losing coverage. Without evidence of creditable coverage, you may be subject to preexisting condition exclusion for 12 months (18 months for late enrollees) after your enrollment date in your coverage in another plan. UNCLAIMED HEALTH CARE REIMBURSEMENTS Any funds that you are not entitled to carry over will be forfeited and returned to the employer . The Carry Over amount will be allocated to your Reimbursement Account by Humana af ter the HRA Run Out Period. Please view the Reimbursement section of this Summary Plan Description to determine the Reimbursement Account limits for your Health Reimbursement Account. 94 SECTION 3 ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE 95 OPEN ENROLLMENT Once annually you will have a choice of enrolling yourself and your eligible dependents in this Plan .

ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 98 TERMINATING THE FAMILY CROSS -REFERENCE PAYMENT OPTION Employees will not be eligible to continue the cross -reference payment option if one spouse loses eligib ility ( e.g. terminates employment, becomes part -time, or goes on leave without pay). 1. A Family Cross -Reference payment option is a legislatively mandated payment option for two (2) eligible employees or retirees . Thus, the Family Cross -Reference payment op tion has two (2) planholders. If either planholder loses employment for any reason (voluntary or involuntary), the Family Cross - Reference payment option terminates as eligibility to participate in the Family Cross -Reference payment option has ceased. Onl y eligible employees may be planholders under the KEHP. Additionally, upon loss of employment that former planholder has lost planholder eligibility status and can only be covered as a dependent on that existing plan. As a result, the remaining planholder will default to parent -plus coverage (from Family Cross -Referencing) reflecting the loss of planholder status of the former planholder. Should the remaining planholder wish to elect dependent coverage for that former planholder, he or she may make that ele ction for dependent coverage within 35 days of the date of loss of coverage of the former planholder. If the remaining planholder wishes to drop to single coverage, he or she may do so by submitting a drop form or new application within 35 days of the dat e of loss of coverage of the former planholder. The remaining planholder will NOT be responsible for the full regular family contribution unless that former planholder is added back to the plan as a dependent, which creates a traditional family plan. MEDICAL CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS An individual who is a child of a covered employee may be enrolled for coverage under this Plan in accordance with the direction of a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) or a National Medical Support Notice (NMSN). A QMCSO is a state court order or judgment, including approval of a settlement agreement that: (a) provides for support of a covered employee's child; (b) provides for health care coverage for that child; (c) is made under state domestic relations law (incl uding a community property law); (d) relates to benefits under this Plan ; and (e) is \"qualified\" in that it meets the technical requirements of applicable law. QMCSO also means a state court order or judgment that enforces a state Medicaid law regarding medical child support required by Social Security Act \u00a71908 (as added by Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993). An NMSN is a notice issued by an appropriate agency of a state or local government that is similar to a QMCSO that requires coverage under this Plan for the dependent child of a non -custodial parent who is (or will become) a covered person by a domestic relations order that provides for health care coverage. Procedures for determining the qualified status of medical child support orders are available at no cost upon request from the Plan Administrator . ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 99 PRE -EXISTING CONDITION LIMITATION Benefits for pre-existing conditions are limited under this Plan . Pre-existing condition is defined in the Definitions section. Once you or your dependents obtain health plan coverage, you are entitled to use evidence of that coverage to reduce or eliminate any pre-existing condition limitation period that might otherwise be imposed when you become covered under a subsequent health plan. Evidence may includ e a certificate of prior creditable coverage . The length of any pre-existing condition limitation period under the subsequent health plan must be reduced by the number of days of creditable coverage . Prior to imposing a pre-existing condition limitation, Humana will: 1. Notify you in writing of the existence and terms of any pre-existing condition limitation; 2. Notify you of your right to request a certificate of creditable coverage from any applicable prior plans; 3. Notify you of your right to submit evidence of creditable coverage to Humana to reduce the length of any pre-existing condition limitation; and 4. Offer to request a certificate of prior creditable coverage on your behalf. If, after receiving evidence of creditable coverage , Humana determines the creditable coverage is not sufficient to completely offset this Plan's pre-existing condition limitation period, Humana will: 1. Notify you in writing of its determination; 2. Notify you of the source and substance of any information on which it relied; and 3. Provide an explanation of appeal procedures and allow a reasonable opportunity to submit additional evidence of creditable coverage . Humana may modify an initial determination of creditable coverage if it determines the individual did not have the claimed creditable coverage , provided Humana: 1. Notifies you of such reconsideration in writing disclosing its determination; 2. Notifies you with the source and substance of any information on which it relied; and 3. Provides an explanation of appeal procedures and all ows a reasonable opportunity to submit additional evidence of creditable coverage . Alternate means of providing evidence of creditable coverage may include an explanation of benefits, correspondence from a plan, pay stubs showing a payroll deduction of premium for health plan coverage, third party statements verifying period(s) of coverage, information obtained by telephone, and any other relevant document providing evidence of period(s) of health coverage. The pre-existing condition limitation does not a pply to: 1. pregnancy; ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 100 2. genetic information in the absence of diagnosis; 3. domestic violence; or 4. newborn children, or children adopted before the age of 18, if they are enrolled under the Plan within 60 days of the date of birth, the date the child is legall y adopted, or the date the child is legally placed for adoption (or 35 days, if other dependents are also being enrolled). 5. Effective as of January 1, 2011, this plan will not impose any pre-existing conditions on individuals enrolled in the plan who ar e under 19 years of age (this includes both employees who may themselves be under 19 years of age and dependents of employees under age 19). SPECIAL PROVISIONS If your employer continues to pay required contributions and does not terminate the Plan, your coverage will remain in force for a period of time as determined by your employer for a layoff, during an approved medical leave of absence, during a period of total disability , during an approved non -medical leave of absence, during an approved military leave of absence or during part -time status . TERMINATING EMPLOYMENT KEHP is a current pay health insurance plan. If you leave employment between the 1st and the 15th of the month, your health insurance coverage will terminate on the 15th of the same mont h. If you leave employment between the 16th and the end of the month, your health insurance coverage will terminate on the last day of the same month. REINSTATEMENT OF COVERAGE If your coverage under this Plan was terminated after a period of layoff, total disability , approved medical leave of ab sence, approved non -medical leave of ab sence or during part -time status and you are now returning to work, your coverage is effective as determined by your employer . The eligibility period requirement with respe ct to the reinstatement of your coverage will be determined by your employer . The pre-existing condition limitation wi ll apply if there is a 63 -day lapse in coverage . If your coverage under this Plan was terminated after an approved military leave of abs ence (other than USERRA) or during part -time status and you are now returning to work, your coverage is effective as determined by your employer . The eligibility period requirement with respect to the reinstatement of your coverage will be determined by your employer . The pre-existing condition limitation will be waived. If your coverage under the Plan was terminated due to a period of service in the uniformed services covered under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, your coverage is effective immediately on the day you return to work. Eligibility waiting periods and pre- existing condition limitations will be imposed only to the extent they were applicable prior to the period of service in the uniformed services. ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 101 FAM ILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA) If you are granted a leave of absence (Leave) by the employer as required by the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act, you may continue to be covered under this Plan for the duration of the Leave under the same conditions as other employees who are in an eligible class and covered by this Plan. If you choose to terminate coverage during the Leave, or if coverage terminates as a result of nonpayment of any required contribution, coverage may be reinstated on the date you return to eligible class following the end of the Leave. Charges incurred after the date of reinstatement will be paid as if you had been continuously covered. EXTENDED BENEFITS If, on the date your coverage terminates under this Plan , you or your covere d dependents are totally disabled as a result of a covered bodily injury or sickness , this Plan will continue to provide medical benefits until the earliest of the following: 1. Until coverage for the total disability has been obtained under another group po licy; or 2. The date your physician certifies you are no longer totally disabled ; or 3. The date you receive benefits equal to any maximum benefit shown on the Schedule of Benefits; or 4. The end of twelve consecutive months immediately following the date of your termination of coverage. This period of time is measured from the date your coverage is terminated under this Plan , to the same calendar day of the next succeeding months. The Extended Benefits provision applies only to covered expenses for the disabli ng condition which existed on the date your coverage terminated. This Plan must remain in effect. RETIREE COVERAGE If you are a retiree who is under age 65 or is age 65 or older and non -Medicare eligible, you may enroll or continue coverage under the Plan for you and any of your eligible dependents . Please see your retirement system for more details. SURVIVORSHIP COVERAGE If the employee dies while dependent coverage is in force, the surviving dependent spouse and dependent children may continue to be covered through the COBRA provision. If you previously declined coverage under this Plan for yourself or any eligible dependents , due to the existence of other health coverage (including COBRA), and that coverage is now lost or exha usted , this Plan permits you, your dependent spouse , and any eligible dependents to be enrolled for medical benefits under this Plan due to any of the following qualifying events : ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 102 1. Loss of coverage due to any of the following: a. Legal separation or an nulment ; b. Divorce; c. Cessation of dependent status (such as attaining the limiting age); d. Death; e. Termination of employment; f. Reduction in the number of hours of employment; g. Meeting or exceeding a lifetime limit on all benefits; h. Plan no longer offering benefits to a class of similarly situated individuals, which includes the employee ; i. Any loss of coverage after a period that is measured by reference to any of the foregoing. However, loss of coverage does not include a loss due t o failure of the individual or the participant to pay premiums on a timely basis or termination of coverage for cause (such as making a fraudulent claim or an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact in connection with the plan). 2. Employer contribu tions towards the other coverage have been terminated. Employer contributions include contributions by any current or former employer (of the individual or another person) that was contributing to coverage for the individual. 3. COBRA coverage under the oth er plan has since been exhausted. If you are a covered employee or an otherwise eligible employee , who either did not enroll or did not enroll dependents when eligible, you now have the opportunity to enroll yourself and/or any previously eligible depende nts or any newly acquired dependents when due to any of the following changes: 1. Marriage; 2. Birth; 3. Adoption or placement for adoption ; 4. Loss of eligibility due to termination of Medicaid or State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) coverage; or 5. Eligibility for premium assistance subsidy under Medicaid or SCHIP. You may elect coverage under this Plan provided enrollment is within 35 days , 60 days from such event as identified in #4 and #5 above from the qualifying event or as listed in the Depende nt Effective Date of Coverage section. You may be required to provide proof that the qualifying event has occurred due to one of the reasons listed before coverage under this Plan will be effective. Coverage under this Plan will be effective the 1st day of the month following the signature date of the enrollment form, but not before the event occurs, unless otherwise specified in this section. In the case of a dependent's birth, enrollment is effective on the date of such birth , provided the appropriate paperwork is received . In the case of a dependent's adoption or placement for adoption, enrollment is effective on the date of such adoption or placement for adoption , provided the appropriate paperwork is received . ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 103 If you become eligible for coverage un der this Plan through the special enrollment provision, benefits under this Plan will be subject to the pre-existing condition limitation as defined within the Definitions section if you are age 19 or older . If you apply more than 35 days after a qualifyi ng event, 60 days from such event as identified in #4 and #5 above or as listed in the Dependent Effective Date of Coverage section, you are considered a late applicant and will not be eligible for coverage under this Plan until the next annual Open Enroll ment Period. Please see your employer for more details. If an employee or dependent changes Insurance Carriers during open enrollment, the existing coverage with the prior Insurance Carrier will terminate on Decem ber 31, except for the following: 1. If a covered member is hospitalized when coverage would normally terminate, the prior Insurance Carrier that covered the member's hospitalization during the previous plan year would continue coverage until the member is released from the hospital or transferred to another facility. At the time the member is released from the hospital or transferred to a new facility, the succeeding Insurance Carrier will assume responsibility for that member . It is the member's respon sibility to ensure that a transfer or re -hospitalization is to a participating facility in compliance with all Plan delivery rules. 2. If a member has family coverage and a covered dependent is hospitalized when coverage would normally terminate due to a change in Insurance Carriers, the hospitalized family member would continue his/her prior coverage until discharge from the hospital or transfer to another facility. All other covered dependents not hospitalized at the date the new coverage begins would b e transferred to the new Plan on the date the new coverage starts (not on the date the hospitalized dependent is released or transferred). 3. If a covered member is not at work and/or is on unofficial leave without pay or otherwise continuing to pay for h is/her own health insurance premiums on the group coverage, that participant will begin coverage with his/her succeeding Insurance Carrier on January 1, even though he/she is not at work. These provisions take precedence over all Extension of Benefits cla uses and Actively at Work clauses contained in any of the Insurance Carrier's standard commercial contracts in compliance with KRS 304.18 -126 and KRS 304.18 -127. Entitlement to Medicare : if an employee , spouse , or dependent who is enrolled in the Plan becomes entitled to coverage ( e.g., becomes enrolled) under Part A or Part B of Medicare , other than coverage consisting solely of benefits under section 1928 of Social Security Act, the employee may make a prospective election change to cancel coverage of t hat employee , spouse , or dependent , under the Plan . In addition, if an employee , spouse or dependent who has been entitled to coverage under Medicare loses eligibility for such coverage, the employee may make a prospective election to commence coverage of that employee , spouse , or dependent under the Plan . Coverage may be elected under this Plan provided enrollment is within 35 days from the entitlement of Medicare . TERMINATION OF COVERAGE 104 Coverage terminates on the earliest of the followin g: 1. The date this Plan terminates; 2. The end of the period for which any required contribution was due and not paid; 3. As determined by your employer when you enter full -time military, naval or air service , except coverage may continue during an approved mil itary leave of absence as indicated in the Special Provisions; 4. The date determined by your employer , when you fail to be in an eligible class of persons according to the eligibility requirements of the employer ; 5. For all employees , as determined by your e mployer , following termination of employment with the employer ; 6. The date determined by your employer you request termination of coverage to be effective for yourself based on valid qualifying event guidelines ; 7. For any benefit, the date the benefit is rem oved from this Plan ; 8. For your dependents , the date your coverage terminates; 9. For a dependent , the date determined by your employer the dependent enters full -time military, naval or air service ; 10. For a dependent , the date determined by your employer such covered person no longer meets the definition of dependent ; or 11. The date determined by your employer you request termination of coverage to be effective for your dependents based on valid qualifying event guidelines . If you or any of your covered dependen ts no longer meet the eligibility requirements, you and your employer are responsible for notifying Humana of the change in status. Coverage will not continue beyond the end of the month in which eligibility ends even if notice has not been given to Human a, employer , or Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky) . TERMINATION OF HRA Coverage for a Participant and/or Eligible Dependent ends on the same date that coverage under the Commonwealth Maximum Choice ends. However, you, your covered spouse , and/or your covered child(ren) may be eligible to continue coverage under this HRA in accordance with federal law beyond the date that coverage would otherwise end if coverage is lost for certain reasons. Your continuation of coverage rights and responsibilities ar e described in the below Continuation of Coverage section. All HRA dollars that are not applied towards Eligible Medical Expenses incurred before your termination date of this SPD are forfeited. 105 SECTION 4 GENERAL PROVISIONS AND REIMBURSEMENT/ SUBROGATION GENERAL PROVISIONS 106 The following provisions are to protect your legal rights and the legal rights of this Plan . PLAN ADMINISTRATION The Plan Sponsor (Commonwe alth of Kentucky) has established and continues to maintain this Plan for the benefit of its employees and their eligible dependents as provided in this document. Benefits under this Plan are provided on a self -insured basis, which means that payment for benefits is ultimately the sole financial responsibility of the Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky) . Certain administrative services with respect to this Plan , such as claims processing, are provided under a services agreement. Humana is not responsi ble, nor will it assume responsibility, for benefits payable under this Plan . Any changes to this Plan , as presented in this Summary Plan Description , must be properly adopted by the Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky) , and material modifications must be timely disclosed in writing and included in or attached to this document. A verbal modification of this Plan or promise having the same effect made by any person will not be binding with respect to this Plan . RESCISSION This Plan will rescind covera ge only due to fraud or an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact. Rescission is a cancellation or discontinuance of coverage that has a retroactive effect. A cancellation or discontinuance is not a rescission if the cancellation or discontinua nce of coverage has only a prospective effect, or the cancellation or discontinuance of coverage is effective retroactively, to the extent it is attributable to a failure to timely pay premium or costs of coverage. CONTESTABILITY This Plan has the right to contest the validity of your coverage under the Plan at any time. RIGHT TO REQUEST OVE RPAYMENTS This Plan reserves the right to recover any payments made by this Plan that were: 1. Made in error; or 2. Made to you or any party on your behalf where this Plan determines the payment to you or any party is greater than the amount payable under this Plan. This Plan has the right to recover against you if this Plan has paid you or any other party on your behalf. TIME LIMIT ON CERTAI N DEFENSES A claim will not be reduced or denied after two years from the effective date of the benefit because a disease or physical condition not excluded and causing the loss existed before the benefit effective date . WORKERS' COMPENSATION NOT AFFECTED This Plan is not issued i n lieu of, nor does it affect any requirement for coverage by any Workers' Compensation or Occupational Disease Act or Law. GENERAL PROVISIONS (continued) 107 WORKERS' COMPENSATIO N If benefits are paid by this Plan and this Plan determines you received Workers' Compensation for the same incident, this Plan has the right to recover as described under the Reimbursement/Subrogation provision. This Plan will exercise its right to recover against you even though: 1. The Workers' Compensation benefits are in dispute or are made by means of settl ement or compromise; 2. No final determination is made that bodily injury or sickness was sustained in the course of, or resulted from, your employment; 3. The amount of Workers' Compensation due to medical or health care is not agreed upon or defined by you or the Workers' Compensation carrier; 4. The medical or health care benefits are specifically excluded from the Workers' Compensation settlement or compromise. You hereby agree that, in consideration for the coverage provided by this Plan , you will notify H umana of any Workers' Compensation claim you make, and that you agree to reimburse this Plan as described above. MEDICAID This Plan will not take into account the fact that an employee or dependent is eligible for medical assistance or Medicaid under sta te law with respect to enrollment, determining eligibility for benefits, or paying claims . If payment for Medicaid benefits has been made under a state Medicaid plan for which payment would otherwise be due under this Plan , payment of benefits under this Plan will be made in accordance with a state law which provides that the state has acquired the rights with respect to a covered employee to the benefits payment. CONSTRUCTION OF PLAN TERMS The Plan Manager (Humana) has the sole right to construe and pre scribe the meaning, scope and application of each and all of the terms of this Plan , including, without limitation, the benefits provided thereunder, the obligations of the beneficiary and the recovery rights of this Plan; such construction and prescriptio n by the Plan Manager (Humana) shall be final and uncontestable. REIMBURSEMENT/SUBROGATION 108 RIGHT OF RECOVERY These provisions apply when Plan benefits are paid as a result of injuries or illnesses you sustained and you have a right to a recovery or received a recovery. SUBROGATION This Plan reserves all rights of subrogation. This means that the Plan has the right to recover its previously paid benefit payments from any award, settlement, or damages that you or your dependent may receive or to which you may become entitled. It also means that the Plan has the right to take action on your behalf to obtain an award, settlement, or damages. The Plan shall have the first lien upon all awards, settlements, or damages subject to its subrogation or rei mbursement rights listed below. This lien shall be in the amount of benefits provided or the amount of benefits that will be provided under the Plan , plus the reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, to enforce the Plan's rights. The beneficiary agrees that by accepting and in return for the payment of covered expenses by the Plan in accordance with the terms of this Plan: 1. The Plan has the right to recover payments for benefits paid for by the Plan . 2. The Plan has the right to recover payment for benefits paid by the Plan to or on behalf of you or your dependent from any award, settlement, or damages that you or your dependent may become entitled to or receive as a result of an accident , a person's fault or negligence, or any other circumstance under which you or your dependent has the right to recover from any other party. 3. The Plan may recover its benefit payments for any type of benefit which may be paid by the Plan , such as medical, dental, vision, mental, disability, supplemental acciden t, or accidental death or dismemberment benefits. 4. An \"award, settlement, or damages\" includes any award, settlement, damages (whether equitable, legal, compensatory, etc.), compensation, benefits, or any other payment of any kind. The amount may be pai d by formal court award, informal compromise, redemption agreement, application for benefits, or otherwise. The amount also may be paid in a lump sum, installment, or annuity payments (such as income replacement). The Plan has the right to recover from all of these amounts. 5. An \"award, settlement, or damages\" includes amounts of any type, kind, nature, or character, regardless of whether the amount identifies or covers the Plan's benefit payments, otherwise relates to medical benefits, or is specifically limited to certain kinds of damages or payments. In addition, attorneys' fees or any other costs associated with the amount will not reduce the amount of the Plan's reimbursement. This Plan has the first priority to recover from your award, settlement, or damages. The Plan's first priority lien also will apply regardless of whether you or your dependent is or was made whole from the award, settlement, or damages, whether before or after the Plan's subrogation recovery. This Plan precludes the operation of the \"make -whole\" and \"common fund\" doctrines. REIMBURSEMENT/SUBROGATION (continued) 109 6. Your \"right to recover\" from any other party means that you or your dependent has the right to recover damages or expenses from another party, such as an individual, partnership, corporation, government, o r other entity, as well as against that party's respective insurance carriers or governmental fund, for causing an injury or illness to you or your dependent or otherwise with respect to any injury or illness incurred by you or your covered dependent . This right to recover from any other party also includes your own insurance carrier, such as your automobile insurance, automobile no -fault coverage, homeowners, personal accident , general liability, or life insurance carrier. It also includes a second medical insurance or other non -insured medical or other coverage. It also includes uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage or programs. The Plan has the right to recover from any of these parties, or any other parties, in connection with your illness or inju ry. In the event you or your dependent is entitled to or receives an award, settlement, or damages from any party (which includes the other party's or your own insurance carrier or coverage), the Plan has the first lien upon the award, settlement, or damag es and must be reimbursed for its benefit payments made to you or your dependent , or on your behalf. The Plan's first lien supersedes any right that the Plan participant may have to be \"made whole.\" In other words, the Plan is entitled to the right of firs t reimbursement out of any award, settlement, or damages the Plan participant procures or may be entitled to procure regardless of whether the Plan participant has received compensation for any of his or her damages or expenses, including any of his or her attorneys' fees or costs. Additionally, the Plan's right of first reimbursement will not be \"set -off\" or reduced for any reason, including attorneys' fees, costs, comparative negligence, limits of collectability or responsibility, or otherwise. As a cond ition to receiving benefits under the Plan , the Plan participant agrees that acceptance of benefits is constructive notice of this provision. Reimbursement to the Plan must be made immediately upon entitlement or receipt of any award, settlement, or damage s. The Plan will charge interest at a reasonable rate for any delay in reimbursement. PLAN'S RIGHT TO ASSERT CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF The Plan has the right, if it so chooses, to assert rights on your behalf to obtain an award, settlement, or damages. Speci fically, through subrogation, the Plan is entitled to all claims , demands, actions, and rights of recovery which you or your dependent may have against or from any party to the extent of the Plan's benefit payments. In addition, this Plan is entitled to at torneys' fees incurred in asserting rights on your behalf. The Plan does not require you or your dependent to pursue a claim against another party. However, as stated above, the Plan reserves the right to directly pursue recovery against another party on your behalf, should you or your dependent elect not to pursue an award, settlement, or damages against or from a party. MISCELLANEOUS SUBROGATION You, your dependent , your attorneys, or anyone acting on your behalf legally cannot do anything to prejudice the rights of the Plan in the exercise of its subrogation rights to recover from, or assert your rights to obtain, an award, settlement, or damages. The Plan's subrogation rights also extend to the guardian or estate of you and your dependent . The Plan's subrogation provisions will apply without limitation by the Plan's Coordination of Benefits provisions, unless the Coordination of Benefits provisions would result in a greater recovery for the Plan. REIMBURSEMENT/SUBROGATION (continued) 110 DUTY TO COOPERATE As a condition to participating in the Plan and receiving benefits under the Plan , you and your dependent agree to be bound by all of the Plan's provisions, including, but not limited to, the Plan's subrogation provisions. The Plan will make benefit payments on a claim on the condition that you or your dependent , upon entitlement or receipt of any award, settlement, or damages, will fully reimburse the Plan for the Plan's benefit payments and for expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs of suit, regardless of an action's outcome) incurr ed by the Plan in collecting this amount. As a precondition to receiving benefits under the Plan , you and your dependent must enter into agreement with the Plan to reimburse the Plan for its benefit payments from any award, settlement, or damages pursuant to the Plan's subrogation provisions. In this agreement, you also must agree to assign direct payment to the Plan from any award, settlement, or damages to the extent of the Plan's benefit payments. You and your dependent also otherwise must sign and deliv er any and all instruments, papers, and reimbursement agreements required by the Plan necessary for the Plan's reimbursement right. You and your dependent also are required to do whatever is requested or necessary in order to fully execute and to fully pro tect all the Plan's rights and to do nothing that would interfere with or diminish those rights. Further, you and your dependent must notify the Plan in writing of any proposed settlement and obtain the Plan's written consent before signing any release or agreeing to any settlement. In any event, the Plan's benefit payments for any current or historical claims under the Plan on your behalf will be deemed to be the equivalent of you or your covered dependent entering into an agreement to reimburse the Plan and otherwise signing and delivering any instruments and papers as required by the Plan . In the event that you or your dependent fails to enter into the foregoing agreement, or to otherwise comply with such requests, the Plan is entitled to withhold or deny benefits otherwise due under the Plan until you do so. RETENTION OF AN ATTORNEY If you or your attorney receives any recovery (whether by award, settlement, damages, compromise, or otherwise), you have an absolute obligation to immediately tender the re covery to the Plan under the terms of this provision. If you or your attorney does not immediately tender the recovery to the Plan , you will be deemed to hold the recovery in constructive trust for the Plan , because you or your attorney is not the rightful owner of the recovery and should not be in possession of the recovery until the Plan has been fully reimbursed. PARTICIPANT'S NONCOMPLIANCE If you or your dependent do not comply with the provisions of this section, the Plan Administrator shall have the authority, at its sole discretion, to deny payment of any claims for benefits by you and to deny or reduce future benefits payable (including payment of future benefits for other injuries or illnesses) under the Plan by the amount due as reimbursement to the Plan . The Plan Administrator may also, at its sole discretion, deny or reduce future benefits (including future benefits for other injuries or illnesses) under any other group benefits plan maintained by the Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky) . The reductions will equal the amount of the required reimbursement. If the Plan must bring an action against you to enforce this provision, then you agree to pay the Plan's attorneys' fees and costs, regardless of the action's outcome. REIMBURSEMENT/SUBROGATION (continued) 111 RIGHT TO COLLECT NEED ED INFORMATION You must cooperate with Humana and when asked, assist Humana by: Authorizing the release of medical information including the names of all providers from whom you received medical attention; Obtaining medical information and/or records from any provider as requested by Humana ; Providing information regarding the circumstances of your sickness or bodily injury ; Providing information about other insurance coverage and benefits, including information related to any bodily injury or sickness for which another party may be liable to pay compensation or benefits; and Providing information Humana requests to administer the Plan . Failure to provide the necessary information will result in denial of any pending or subsequent claims , pertaining to a bodily injury or sickness for which the information is sought, until the necessary information is satisfactorily provided. REIMBURSEMENT/SUBROGATION EXCLUSIONS Any covered expenses to the extent of any amount received from others for the bodily injuries or losses which necessitate such benefits. Without limitation, \"amounts received from others\" specifically includes, but is not limited to, liability insurance, worker's compensation, uninsured motorists, underinsured motorists, \"no -fault\" and automobile m ed-pay payments or recovery from any identifiable fund regardless of whether the beneficiary was made whole . 112 SECTION 5 NOTICES IMPORTANT NOTICES FOR EMPLOYEES AND SPOUSES AGE 65 AND OVER 113 Federal law may affec t your coverage under this Plan. The Medicare as Secondary Payer rules were enacted by an amendment to the Social Security Act. Also, additional rules which specifically affect how a large group health plan provides coverage to employees (or their spouse s) over age 65 were added to the Social Security Act and to the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, the health care plan of an employer that has at least 20 employees must operate in compliance with these rules in providing plan coverage to plan participant s who have \"current employment status\" and are Medicare beneficiaries, age 65 and over. Persons who have \"current employment status\" with an employer are generally employees who are actively working and also persons who are NOT actively working as follows : Individuals receiving disability benefits from an employer for up to 6 months; or Individuals who retain employment rights and have not been terminated by the employer and for whom the employer continues to provide coverage under this Plan . (For examp le, employees who are on an approved leave of absence). If you are a person with \"current employment status\" who is age 65 and over (or the dependent spouse age 65 and over of an employee of any age), your coverage under this Plan will be provided on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to employees (or dependent spouses ) who are under the age of 65. Your rights under this Plan do not change because you (or your dependent spouse ) are eligible for Medicare coverage on the basis of age, as long a s you have \"current employment status\" with your employer . You have the option to reject plan coverage offered by your employer , as does any eligible employee . If you reject coverage under your employer's Plan , coverage is terminated and your employer is not permitted to offer you coverage that supplements Medicare covered services . This includes any Medicare Supplement coverage that may be available to you as a result of your retirement through a Kentucky Retirement System. If you (or your dependent spouse) obtain Medicare coverage on the basis of age, and not due to disability or end -stage renal disease, this Plan will consider its coverage to be primary to Medicare when you have elected coverage under this Plan and have \"current employment status\". If a Medicare eligible employee is re -employed by any agency of the Commonwealth in a position working at least 100 hours per month (or otherwise eligible for benefits pursuant to KRS 18A.225), he or she will be eligible to re -enroll (or to remain enrolled) in the Kentucky Employees' Health Plan. While a Medicare eligible retiree is actively employed by the Commonwealth and eligible to participate in the KEHP, federal law provides that he or she is not eligible to receive coverage from any Kentucky retiremen t system (including the Kentucky Retirement System, Judicial/Legislative Retirement, and Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System, etc.) that supplements the employee's Medicare coverage. According to federal Medicare laws, a health plan must pay primary to Medicare . Therefore, any health coverage the employee receives from a Kentucky -sponsored program (KEHP) must pay for Medicare - covered expenses, up to the limit of his or her coverage under the Kentucky program, before applying to Medicare for payment. If a n employee is currently receiving Medicare supplemental coverage from one of the Kentucky retirement system(s), the employee should drop this supplemental coverage while he or she is actively employed and eligible to participate in the KEHP. IMPORTANT NOTICES FOR EMPLOYEES AND SPOUSES AGE 65 AND OVER (continued) 114 If a Medicar e eligible reemployed employee elects KEHP health plan or the \"waiver\" HRA, it must pay primary ( e.g. before) to Medicare covered expenses. If you have any questions about how coverage under this Plan relates to Medicare coverage, please contact your Medi care office .

CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL BENEFITS 117 THE CONSOLIDATED OMN IBUS BUD GET RECONCILIATION A CT OF 1986 (COBRA) CONTINUATION OF BENE FITS On April 7, 1986, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( COBRA ) was signed into law. This federal law applies to employers with 20 or more employees. The law requires that emp loyers offer employees and/or their dependents continuation of medical coverage at group rates in certain instances where there is a loss of group insurance coverage. ELIGIBILITY A qualified beneficiary under COBRA law means an employee , employee's spous e or dependent child covered by this Plan on the day before a qualifying event . A qualified beneficiary under COBRA law also includes a child born to the employee during the coverage period or a child placed for adoption with the employee during the cover age period. EMPLOYEE : An employee covered by the employer's Plan has the right to elect continuation coverage if coverage is lost due to one of the following qualifying events : Termination (for reasons other than gross misconduct , as defined by your emp loyer ) of the employee's employment or reduction in the hours of employee's employment; or Termination of retiree coverage when the former employer discontinues retiree coverage within one year before or one year after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. SPOUSE : A spouse covered by the employer's Plan has the right to elect continuation coverage if the group coverage is lost due to one of the following qualifying events : The death of the employee ; Termination of the employee's employment (for reasons oth er than gross misconduct , as defined by your employer ) or reduction of the employee's hours of employment with the employer ; Divorce or legal separation from the employee ; The employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits; or Termination of a retiree spouse's coverage when the former employer discontinues retiree coverage within one year before or one year after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. DEPENDENT CHILD : A dependent child covered by the employer's Plan has the right to continuation coverage i f group coverage is lost due to one of the following qualifying events : The death of the employee -parent; The termination of the employee -parent's employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct , as defined by your employer ) or reduction in the emplo yee-parent's hours of employment with the employer ; The employee -parent's divorce or legal separation; CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL BENEFITS (continued) 118 Ceasing to be a \" dependent child\" under this Plan; The employee -parent becomes entitled to Medicare benefits; or Termination of the retiree -parent' s coverage when the former employer discontinues retiree coverage within one year before or one year after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. LOSS OF COVERAGE Coverage is lost in connection with the foregoing qualified events, when a covered employee , spouse or dependent child ceases to be covered under the same Plan terms and conditions as in effect immediately before the qualifying event (such as an increase in the premium or contribution that must be paid for employee , spouse or dependent child coverage ). If coverage is reduced or eliminated in anticipation of an event (for example, an employer eliminating an employee's coverage in anticipation of the termination of the employee's employment, or an employee eliminating the coverage of the employee's spouse in anticipation of a divorce or legal separation), the reduction or elimination is disregarded in determining whether the event causes a loss of coverage. A loss of coverage need not occur immediately after the event, so long as it occurs before the e nd of the Maximum Coverage Period. NOTICES AND ELECTION This Plan provides that coverage terminates for a spouse due to legal separation or divorce or for a child when that child loses dependent status. Under the law, the employee or qualified beneficia ry has the responsibility to inform the Plan Administrator (see Plan Description Information) if one of the above events has occurred. The qualified beneficiary must give this notice within 60 days after the event occurs. (For example, an ex -spouse shoul d make sure that the Plan Administrator is notified of his or her divorce, whether or not his or her coverage was reduced or eliminated in anticipation of the event). When the Plan Administrator is notified that one of these events has happened, it is the Plan Administrator's responsibility to notify Humana who has contracted with a COBRA Service Provider who will in turn notify the qualified beneficiary of the right to elect continuation coverage. For a qualified beneficiary who is determined under the S ocial Security Act to be disabled at any time during the first 60 days of COBRA coverage, the continuation coverage period may be extended 11 additional months. The disability that extends the 18 -month coverage period must be determined under Title II (Ol d Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) or Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act. To be entitled to the extended coverage period, the disabled qualified beneficiary must provide notice to the COBRA Service Provider within the initial 18 month coverage period and within 60 days after the date of the determination of disability under the Social Security Act. Failure to provide this notice will result in the loss of the right to extend the COBRA continuation period. For ter mination of employment, reduction in work hours, the death of the employee , the employee becoming covered by Medicare or loss of retiree benefits due to bankruptcy, it is the Plan Administrator's responsibility to notify Humana who has contracted with a COBRA Service Provider who will in turn notify the qualified beneficiary of the right to elect continuation coverage. Under the law, continuation coverage must be elected within 60 days after Plan coverage ends, or if later, 60 days after the date of the no tice of the right to elect continuation coverage. If continuation coverage is not elected within the 60 day period, the right to elect coverage under this Plan will end. CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL BENEFITS (continu ed) 119 A covered employee or the spouse of the covered employee may elect continuation cove rage for all covered dependents , even if the covered employee or spouse of the covered employee or all covered dependents are covered under another group health plan (as an employee or otherwise) prior to the election. The covered employee , his or her spouse and dependent child, however, each have an independent right to elect continuation coverage. Thus a spouse or dependent child may elect continuation coverage even if the covered employee does not elect it. Coverage will not be provided during the ele ction period. However, if the individual makes a timely election, coverage will be provided from the date that coverage would otherwise have been lost. If coverage is waived before the end of the 60 day election period and the waiver revoked before the e nd of the 60 day election period, coverage will be effective on the date the election of coverage is sent to the COBRA Service Provider . On August 6, 2002, The Trade Act of 2002 (TAA), was signed in to law. Workers whose employment is adversely affected by international trade (increased import or shift in production to another country) may become eligible to receive TAA. TAA provides a second 60 -day COBRA election period for those who become eligible for assistance under TAA. Pursuant to the Trade Act o f 1974, an individual who is either an eligible TAA recipient or an eligible alternative TAA recipient and who did not elect continuation coverage during the 60 -day COBRA election period that was a direct consequence of the TAA -related loss of coverage, ma y elect continuation coverage during a 60 -day period that begins on the first day of the month in which he or she is determined to be TAA -eligible individual, provided such election is made not later than 6 months after the date of the TAA -related loss of coverage. Any continuation coverage elected during the second election period will begin with the first day of the second election period and not on the date on which coverage originally lapsed. TAA created a new tax credit for certain individuals who be came eligible for trade adjustment assistance (eligible individuals). Under the new tax provisions, eligible individuals can either take a tax credit or get advance payment of 65% of premiums paid for qualified health insurance, including continuation coverage. If you have questions about these new tax provisions, you may call the Health Care Tax Credit Customer Contact Center toll -free at 1 -866-628-4282. TTD/TTY callers may call toll -free at 1-866-626-4282. The Plan Administrator shall require docume ntation evidencing eligibility of TAA benefits. This Plan need not require every available document to establish evidence of TAA. The burden for evidencing TAA eligibility is that of the individual applying for coverage under this Plan . MAXIMUM COVERAGE PERIOD Coverage may continue up to: 18 months for an employee and/or dependent whose group coverage ended due to termination of the employee's employment or reduction in hours of employment; 36 months for a spouse whose coverage ended due to the death of the employee or retiree , divorce, or the employee becoming entitled to Medicare at the time of the initial qualifying event ; 36 months for a dependent child whose coverage ended due to the divorce of the employee parent, the employee becoming entitled to Medicare at the time of the initial qualifying event , the death of the employee , or the child ceasing to be a dependent under this Plan ; CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL BENEFITS (continued) 120 For the retiree , until the date of death of the retiree who is on continuation due to loss of coverage within one y ear before or one year after the employer filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. DISABILITY An 11 -month extension of coverage may be available if any of the qualified beneficiaries are determined by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to be disabled. The dis ability has to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18 - month period of continuation coverage. The qualified beneficiary must provide notice of such determination prior to the end of the initial 18 -month continuation period to be entitled to the additional 11 months of coverage. Each qualified beneficiary who has elected continuation coverage will be entitled to the 11 -month disability extension if one of them qualifies. I f a qualified beneficiary is determined by SSA to no longer be disabled, you must notify this Plan of that fact within 30 days after SSA's determination. SECOND QUALIFYING EVENT An 18 -month extension of coverage will be available to spouses and dependent children who elect continuation coverage if a second qualifying event occurs during the first 18 months of continuation coverage. The maximum amount of continuation coverage available when a second qualifying event occurs is 36 months. Such second quali fying event may include the death of a covered employee , divorce or separation from the covered employee , the covered employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), or a dependent child's ceasing to be eligible for cover age as a dependent under this Plan . These events can be a second qualifying event only if they would have caused the qualified beneficiary to lose coverage under this Plan if the first qualifying event had not occurred. You must notify this Plan within 6 0 days after the second qualifying event occurs if you want to extend your continuation coverage. TERMINATION BEFORE T HE END OF MAXIMUM CO VERAGE PERIOD Continuation coverage will terminate before the end of the maximum coverage period for any of the following reasons: The employer no longer provides group health coverage to any of its employees ; The premium for continuation is not paid timely; The individual on continuation becomes covered under another group health plan (as an employee or otherwise) ; however, if the new plan coverage contains any exclusion or limitation with respect to any pre-existing condition , then continuation coverage will end for this reason only after the exclusion or limitation no longer applies or prior creditable coverage satisfies the exclusion or limitation; NOTE: The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 requires portability of health care coverage effective for plan years beginning after June 30, 1997, an exclusion or limitation under the o ther group health plan may not apply at all to the qualified beneficiary , depending on the length of his or her prior creditable coverage. Portability means once you obtain health insurance, you will be able to use evidence of that insurance to reduce or eliminate any pre -existing medical condition limitation period (under certain circumstances) when you move from one health plan to another. CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL BENEFITS (continued) 121 The individual on continuation becomes entitled to Medicare benefits; If there is a final determination under Titl e II or XVI of the Social Security Act that an individual is no longer disabled; however, continuation coverage will not end until the month that begins more than 30 days after the determination; The occurrence of any event (e.g. submission of a fraudulen t claim ) permitting termination of coverage for cause under this Plan . TYPE OF COVERAGE; PR EMIUM PAYMENT If continuation coverage is elected, the coverage must be identical to the coverage provided under the employer's Plan to similarly situated non -COBR A beneficiaries. This means that if the coverage for similarly situated non -COBRA beneficiaries is modified, coverage for the individual on continuation will be modified. The initial premium payment for continuation coverage is due by the 45th day after coverage is elected. The initial premium includes charges back to the date the continuation coverage began. All other premiums are due on the first of the month for which the premium is paid, subject to a 31 day grace period. The COBRA Service Provider must provide the individual with a quote of the total monthly premium . Premium for continuation coverage may be increased, however, the premium may not be increased more than once in any determination period. The determination period is a 12 month period which is established by this Plan . The monthly premium payment to this Plan for continuing coverage must be submitted directly to the COBRA Service Provider . This monthly premium may include the employee's share and any portion previously paid by the employer . The monthly premium must be a reasonable estimate of the cost of providing coverage under this Plan for similarly situated non -COBRA beneficiaries. The premium for COBRA continuation coverage may include a 2% administration charge. However, for qualified beneficiaries who are receiving up to 11 months additional coverage (beyond the first 18 months) due to disability extension (and not a second qualifying event ), the premium for COBRA continuation coverage may be up to 150% of the applicable prem ium for the additional months. Qualified beneficiaries who do not take the additional 11 months of special coverage will pay up to 102% of the premium cost. OTHER INFORMATION Additional information regarding rights and obligations under this Plan and u nder federal law may be obtained by contacting the COBRA Service Provider or Humana. It is important for the covered person or qualified beneficiary to keep the Plan Administrator , COBRA Service Provider and Humana informed of any changes in marital statu s, or a change of address.

A premium subsidy is available for certain assistance eligible individ uals (AEIs) for periods of coverage beginning on or after February 17, 2009 \u2014generally March 1, 2009. The AEI pays 35% of the COBRA premium and the employer is then reimbursed by the federal government for the other 65% of the COBRA premium, through a credi t or refund of an overpayment of payroll taxes. The premium subsidy is available for up to 15 months of the AEI's maximum coverage period. Please contact your Insurance Coordinator and Ceridian for more information THE UNIFORMED SERVICES EMPLOYMENT AND REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS ACT OF 1994 (USERRA) 123 CONTINUATION OF BENE FITS Effective October 13, 1994 federal law requires that health plans must offer to continue coverage for employees who are absent due to service in the uniformed services and /or their dependents . Coverage may continue for up to twenty -four (24) months after the date the employee is first absent due to uniformed service. ELIGIBILITY An employee is eligible for continuation under USERRA if absent from employment because of v oluntary or involuntary performance of duty in the Armed Forces, Army National Guard, Air National Guard, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service or any other category of persons designated by the President of the United States of America in a time of war or national emergency .

An employee's dependent who has coverage under this Plan immediately prior to the date of the employee's covered absence are eligible to elect continuation under USERRA. PREMIUM PAYMENT If continuation of Plan coverage is elected under USERRA, the employee or dependent is responsible for payment of the applicable cost of coverage. If the employee is absent for 30 days or less, the cost will be the amount the employee would otherwise pay for coverage. For absences exceeding 30 days, the cost may be up to 102% of the cost of coverage under this Plan . This includes the employee's share and any portion previously paid by the employer . DURATION OF COVERAGE Elected continuation coverage under USERRA will continue until the earlier of: 24 months beginnin g the first day of absence from employment due to service in the uniformed services; or The day after the employee fails to apply for, or return to employment, as required by USERRA, after completion of a period of service.

THE NEWBORNS' AND MOTHERS' HEALTH PROTECTION ACT OF 1996 The Newborns' and Mothers' Healt h Protection Act of 1996 provides that group health plans and health insurance issuers generally may not, under Federal law, restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hou rs following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a cesarean section. However, Federal law generally does not prohibit the mother's or newborn's attending provider , after consulting with the mother, from discharging the mother or her newbor n earlier than 48 hours (or 96 hours as applicable). An attending provider is defined as an individual who is licensed under applicable state law to provide maternal or pediatric care and who is directly responsible for providing such care to a mother or newborn child.

This Plan will continue the child 's coverage for up to one year after the leave of absence begins or, if earlier, until coverage would have otherwise terminated under the terms of the Plan. ADDITIONAL NOTICES (continued) 126 MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT (MHPA) AND MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2008 This Plan operates in compliance with Mental Health Parity Act and the Additional Equity Act of 2008 as forth in the Public Health Service Act (PHSA).

NOTICE ABOUT THE EARLY RETIREE REINSURANCE PROGRAM You ar e a plan participant, or are being offered the opportunity to enroll as a plan participant, in an employment based health plan that is certified for participation in the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program. The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program is a Federal program that was established under the Affordable Care Act. Under the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, the Federal government reimburses a plan sponsor of an employment -based health plan for some of the costs of health care benefits paid on behalf of, or by, early retirees and certain family members of early retirees participating in the employment - based plan. By law, the program expires on January 1, 2014. Under the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, your plan sponsor may choose to use any reimbursemen ts it receives from this program to reduce or offset increases in plan participants' premium contributions, co - payments, deductibles, co -insurance, or other out -of-pocket costs. If the plan sponsor chooses to use the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program reimb ursements in this way, you, as a plan participant, may experience changes that may be advantageous to you, in your health plan coverage terms and conditions, for so long as the reimbursements under this program are available and this plan sponsor chooses t o use the reimbursements for this purpose. A plan sponsor may also use the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program reimbursements to reduce or offset increases in its own costs for maintaining your health benefits coverage, which may increase the likelihood that it will continue to offer health benefits coverage to its retirees and employees and their families. MEDICAID AND THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP) 127 Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Offer Free Or Low -Cost Health Coverage To Children And Families If you are eligible for health coverage from your employer , but are unable to afford the premiums, some States have premium assistance programs that can help pay for coverage. These States use funds from their Medicaid or CHIP programs to help people who are eligible for employer -sponsored health coverage, but need assistance in paying their health premiums. If you or your dependents are already enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and you l ive in a State listed belo w, you can contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office to find out if premium assistance is available. If you or your dependents are NOT currently enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, and you think you or any of your dependents might be eligible for either of t hese programs, you can contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office or dial 1-877-KIDS NOW or www.insurekidsnow.gov to find out how to apply. If you qualify, you can ask the State if it has a program that might help you pay the premiums for an employer -spon sored plan. Once it is determined that you or your dependents are eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP, your employer's health plan is required to permit you and your dependents to enroll in the plan - as long as you and your dependent s are eligible, but not already enrolled in the employer's plan.

This includes adding a dependent to the Plan who does not meet the KEHP eligibility rules. The KEHP requires documentation to verify a dependent's eligibility before coverage will be provided under the Plan. Examples of such documentation incl ude but are not limited to marriage certificate, birth certificate, court documents and/or guardianship papers. The health care reform law (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) generally requires group health plans that offer dependent coverage t o continue making such coverage available for an adult child until age 26 for plan years beginning on January 1, 2011.

Under the se regulations, children who become (or are required to become) eligible to enroll as a result of this requirement must be given written notice of their enrollment right not later than the first day of the plan year. They must be given at least 30 days to enroll, regardless of whether the plan otherwise offers an open enrollment period. This notice of the eligibility changes was provided via U.S. Mail to all KEHP members in their 2011 Open Enrollment materials.

Proc. 2008 -48 applies (regarding certain children of divorced or separated parents who receive more than half of their support for the calendar year from one or both parents and are in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of the calendar year). Because this plan is \"grandfathered\" for plan year 2011 , this plan is not required to extend coverage to children who are eligible for coverage under another employer's group health plan ( e.g., eligible under the plan of the child's own employer).

The plan shall not cover any technology or any hospitalization in connection with such technology if such technology is obsolete or ineffective and is not used generally by the medical community for the particular diagnosis or treatment of the covered person's particular condition. Governmental approval of a technology is not necessarily sufficient to render it of proven benefit or appropriate or effective for a particular diagnosis or treatment of the particular condition as explained below.

A medical device, drug, or biological product that meets the above tests shall not be considered experimental or investigational . In any event, any drug which the FDA has determined to be contraindicated for the specific treatment for which the drug has been prescribed shall be considered experimental or investigational . 2. Conclusive evidence from the published peer -review medical literature must exist that the technology has a definite positive effect on health outcomes; such evidence must include w ell- designed investigations that have been reproduced by nonaffiliated authoritative sources, with measurable results, backed up by the positive endorsements of national medical bodies or panels regarding scientific efficacy and rationale; DEFINITIONS (continued) 146 3. Demonstrated e vidence as reflected in the published peer -review medical literature must exist that over time the technology leads to improvement in health outcomes, e.g., the beneficial effects outweigh any harmful effects; 4. Proof as reflected in the published peer -reviewed medical literature must exist that the technology is at least as effective in improving health outcomes as established technology, or is usable in appropriate clinical contexts in which established technology is not employable; and 5. Proof as reflected in the published peer -reviewed medical literature must exist that improvements in health outcomes, as defined in paragraph C, are possible in standard conditions of medical practice, outside clinical investigatory settings.
