Please note you do not have an appointment until you receive confirmation from us. I had some chronic back problems when I decided to give Balance Chiropractic Clinic a visit. Dr. Troy Norris performed an evaluation and determined I had two [pinched nerves](neck-pain.html). I have been going to see him for the past couple months and feel 10 times better. The office staff is wonderful and Dr. Norris is very personable and knows his stuff. Definitely a great idea for me to walk through that door as it would be for you. Holistic approach and gentle treatment for chronic back issues. Professional and welcoming. Excellent explanations of technical aspects of health problems. I am very hopeful to regain pain-free movement and grateful the office works with my out-of-network insurance. Definitely worth it!
