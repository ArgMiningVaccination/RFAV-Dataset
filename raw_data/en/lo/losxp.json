Northwestern Medicine Urology has long fostered a culture of research excellence found in only a handful of academic medical centers. While many academic and clinical departments of urology conduct research, we possess a unique and far-reaching research program featuring a depth and breadth of research initiatives that few institutions can match. From clinical trials to translational and basic science studies, our investigators tirelessly work to advance urologic care and better care. Here are some highlights of the high impact research studies underway at Northwestern Medicine Urology: Developing Cancer Blockers to Key Cancer Gene Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. To develop more effective therapies, the In animal models, the team has made significant headway in identifying a series of MYC inhibitors that offer favorable pharmacokinetic profiles to help silence MYC expression and remodel the tumor-immune microenvironment. Currently, the team is developing several novel MYC inhibitor compounds. Additionally, the Abdulkadir Lab has identified a gene \u2014 PRRX2 \u2014 that appears to be involved in the development of resistance to a commonly used prostate cancer treatment: androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs). Many metastatic prostate cancers eventually become resistant to standard therapy and become AR-negative. Patients with upregulated PRRX2 tend to have worse survival compared to other patients, especially those who are AR-negative. While much is still unknown about this gene and its connection to androgen insensitivity, it offers potential to mitigate these pathways by inhibiting them downstream. This research offers hope in finding solutions for the growing numbers of patients that fail therapy because they become AR-negative. Boosting the Effectiveness of Immunotherapy While a game changer in cancer treatment today, immunotherapy has yet to work well for patients with advanced or late-stage prostate cancer. The In animal models, the investigators found this novel drug worked to \"fuel up\" immune system function and effectively stop the spread of tumor cells. These results also offer hope for improving the response of prostate cancer patients to current immunotherapies. The Wu team hopes to bring this innovative therapy to the clinical trials stage soon. Understanding Epigenetic Regulators of Cancer The The findings suggest EZH2's dual role in regulating transcription and translation in EZH2-high cancer cells to promote cancer progression by accelerating ribosome functions and contributing to cancer-related translational control. Targeting EZH2 by ridding it of its non-methyltransferase roles could be an effective therapeutic approach to treating solid tumors. This new approach would be encouraging, as current EZH2-targeting strategies primarily focus on inhibiting the lysine methyltransferase activity of EZH2, which previous work has found does not completely prevent solid tumor progression. Using Big Data to Enhance Precision Medicine Starting with genomics \u2014 an organism's complete set of genetic instructions \u2014 a variety of \"omics\" data has opened the door to understanding diseases at the molecular level in ways that were once unimaginable. Evaluating disease at this minute level of detail offers great potential for revolutionizing the diagnosis and targeted treatment of a wide array of human disorders. The Developing algorithms for next-generation sequencing technologies and leveraging multi-omics data results, the Yang team is working to better understand the complex genetic mutations that drive the development and growth of both primary and metastatic prostate cancer. Identifying of specific subtypes of prostate cancer and their distinct pattern of genetic variations offers an invaluable blueprint for more reliably predicting patient outcomes and prescribing personalized treatment. Linking Immune Dysfunction to Chronic Pelvic Pain Chronic prostatitis (male pelvic pain) affects some 8% of men. From difficulty urinating to pain in areas below the belly button and between the hips, this condition often has no known cause and can lead to poor quality of life. Diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) often relies on a process of elimination and treatments that only focus on symptom relief. In lab studies, the The Thumbikat team also is investigating the role of bacteria in benign prostate pain using a unique E. coli strain isolated from a patient that appears to be involved in immune activity in the prostate. This novel work has led to several promising paths of inquiry, from enhancing pain relief for urologic conditions to treating prostate cancer with immunotherapy. In addition to CPPS, urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome includes interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). This condition mostly afflicts women but, like CPPS, it lacks clinically useful biomarkers and effective therapies. The Most recently, the team has found that specific brain immune cells known to influence pain and cognitive function \u2014 microglia \u2014 undergo activation in IC/BPS mice and appear to transduce signals from altered gut microbiota. This discovery points to the potential of developing novel IC/BPS therapies. In parallel studies, the team has identified specific strains of E. coli commonly associated with benign colonization of the bladder of older adult patients that possess potent analgesic activity. The investigators hope these strains of E. coli can be developed to treat IC/BPS and other chronic pain conditions. Starving Kidney and Other Urologic Cancers to Death The In the meantime, the drug has no ill effect on normal cells with a different cholesterol metabolism. The Thaxton team initially looked at lymphoma cells, but the new experimental agent holds promise for use in urologic cancers, such as kidney cancer and prostate cancer. Patients with advanced disease in these urologic organs currently have little to zero options when standard therapies fail to work. This exciting new treatment offers new hope. The synthetic lipoprotein nanoparticle is now in the pre-clinical drug phase, with Northwestern Medicine investigators working to drive the novel therapy through to clinical trials. Overcoming Health Disparities in Urologic Cancers In the United States, Black men and men of African ancestry have double the risk of dying from prostate cancer than white men. Enhancing the health outcomes for this minority group and others is a major area of research for the No single reason accounts for the disparity in outcomes for Black men and men of African ancestry compared to their white counterparts. Taking a multifactorial approach, Other groundbreaking work in the Schaeffer group has revealed that Black men with aggressive prostate cancers respond better to immunotherapy than white men due to an abundance of plasma B cells. On average, the team found more of these specialized immune cells in tumors from Black men, and in all men with elevated plasma cell levels \u2014 advancing knowledge that ultimately benefits all patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer. Although men are four times more likely to develop bladder cancer (urothelial carcinoma), women often develop more aggressive disease. Additionally, because blood in the urine is frequently the first symptom of bladder cancer, women who have periods may associate blood in their urine with menstruation and delay seeking medical advice. Scientists are beginning to understand the importance of differences between male and female bladders.
