No physician or caregiver shall withhold or withdraw such treatment for a respondent whose condition is not terminal or whose death is not imminent. If the physician or caregiver cannot obtain valid consent for medically necessary treatment from the guardian, he shall provide the medically necessary treatment as authorized by section 39 - 4504(1)(i), Idaho Code. (8) A guardian appointed under this chapter may consent to withholding or withdrawal of artificial life - sustaining procedures, only if the respon- dent: (a) Has an incurable injury, disease, illness or condition, certified by the respondent's attending physician and at least one (1) other physician to be terminal such that the application of artificial life - sustaining procedures would not result in the possibility of sav- ing or significantly prolonging the life of the respondent, and would only serve to prolong the moment of the respondent's death for a period of hours, days or weeks, and where both physicians certify that death is imminent, whether or not the life - sustaining procedures are used; or (b) Has been diagnosed by the respondent's attending physician and at least one (1) other physician as being in a persistent vegetative state which is irreversible and from which the respondent will never regain consciousness.

If adult protective services or the protection and advocacy system de- termines that withholding of medical treatment violates the provisions of this section, they may petition the court for an ex parte order to provide or continue the medical treatment in question. If the court finds, based on affidavits or other evidence, that there is probable cause to believe that the withholding of medical treatment in a particular case violates the pro- visions of this section, and that the life or health of the patient is en- dangered thereby, the court shall issue an ex parte order to continue or to provide the treatment until such time as the court can hear evidence from the parties involved. Petitions for court orders under this section shall be expedited by the courts and heard as soon as possible. No bond shall be re- quired of a petitioner under this section. (10) No partial or total guardian or partial or total conservator ap- pointed under the provisions of this section may without specific approval of the court in a proceeding separate from that in which such guardian or con- servator was appointed: (a) Consent to medical or surgical treatment the effect of which per- manently prohibits the conception of children by the respondent unless the treatment or procedures are necessary to protect the physical health of the respondent and would be prescribed for a person who is not developmentally disabled does not have a developmental disability ; (b) Consent to experimental surgery, procedures or medications; or (c) Delegate the powers granted by the order.

PURPOSE. The purpose of this chapter is to prevent acquisi- tion or divestiture of control of an insurer or a holding company system of which an insurer is a part where such acquisition would be adverse to the public interest and the interests of policyholders and shareholders. A fur- ther purpose of this chapter is to promote the public interest and the in- terests of policyholders and shareholders by facilitating, consistent with those interests, better use of management skills and services, diversifica- tion through acquisitions, free access to capital markets, sound tax plan- ning and open competition. An additional purpose is to monitor and regulate insurance holding company systems. 41 - 3802. DEFINITIONS. As used in this chapter the following terms shall have the following meanings: (1) \"Affiliate\" of, or a person \"affiliated\" with, a specific person, means a person who directly or indirectly through one (1) or more interme- diaries controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified. (2) \"Control,\" including \"controlling,\" \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with,\" means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract other than a commercial contract for goods or nonmanagement services, or otherwise, unless the power is the result of an official position with or a corporate office held by the person. Control shall be presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote or holds proxies representing ten percent (10%) or more of the voting securities of any other person. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing made in the manner provided in section 41 - 3809(11), Idaho Code, that control does not exist in fact. The director may determine, after furnishing all persons in interest notice and opportunity to be heard and making specific findings of fact to support the determination, that control exists in fact, notwithstanding the absence of a presumption to that effect. (3) \"Enterprise risk\" means any activity, circumstance, event or se- ries of events involving one (1) or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not C. 266 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 653 remedied promptly, is likely to have a material adverse effect upon the fi- nancial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding com- pany system as a whole including, but not limited to, anything that would cause the insurer's risk - based capital to fall into company action level as set forth in section 41 - 5403, Idaho Code, or would cause the insurer to be in hazardous financial condition as set forth by rule in IDAPA 18.01.66. (4) \"Insurance holding company system\" means two (2) or more affiliated persons, one (1) or more of whom is an insurer. (5) \"Insurer\" has the same meaning as that set forth in section 41 - 103, Idaho Code, except that it shall not include agencies, authorities or in- strumentalities of the United States, its possessions and territories, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia or a state or political subdivision of a state. (6) \"Person\" means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a joint stock company, a business trust, an unincorporated organization, or any similar entity or any combi- nation of the foregoing acting in concert, but shall not include any joint venture partnership exclusively engaged in owning, managing, leasing or de- veloping real or tangible personal property. (7) \"Security holder\" means a person who owns any security of a speci- fied person, including common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and any other security convertible into or evidencing the right to acquire any of the foregoing. (8) \"Subsidiary\" means a specified person who is an affiliate con- trolled by such person directly or indirectly through one (1) or more intermediaries. (9) \"Voting security\" means any security convertible into or evidenc- ing a right to acquire a voting security. 41 - 3803. SUBSIDIARIES OF INSURERS. (1) A domestic insurer, either by itself or in cooperation with one (1) or more persons, may organize or ac- quire one (1) or more subsidiaries. The subsidiaries may conduct any kind of business or businesses and their authority to do so shall not be limited by reason of the fact that they are subsidiaries of a domestic insurer. (2) In addition to investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities permitted under title 41, Idaho Code, a do- mestic insurer may also: (a) Invest in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities of one (1) or more subsidiaries in amounts that do not exceed the lesser of ten percent (10%) of the insurer's assets or fifty percent (50%) of the insurer's surplus regarding policyholders, provided that after making such investments, the insurer's surplus regarding poli- cyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and will be adequate to meet its financial needs. In calcu- lating the amount of such investments, investments in domestic or for- eign insurance subsidiaries shall be excluded, but the following shall be included: (i) Total net moneys or other consideration expended and obli- gations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capi- tal and surplus of the subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities; and (ii) All amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities and all contributions to the capital or surplus of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation. (b) Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obliga- tions and other securities of one (1) or more subsidiaries engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of as- 654 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 266 2013 sets authorized as investments for the insurer, provided that each sub- sidiary agrees to limit its investment in any asset so that the invest- ment will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection or in chapter 7, title 41, Idaho Code, applicable to the insurer. For the purpose of this section, \"the total investment of the insurer\" shall include: (i) Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset; and (ii) The insurer's proportionate share of any investment in an as- set by any subsidiary of the insurer, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary's investment by the per- centage of the ownership of the subsidiary. (c) With the approval of the director, invest any greater amount in com- mon stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities of one (1) or more subsidiaries, provided that after making the investment, the insurer's surplus regarding policyholders will be reasonable in re- lation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and will be adequate to its financial needs. (3) Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities of subsidiaries made pursuant to subsection (2)(a) of this section shall not be subject to any of the otherwise applicable restrictions or prohibitions contained in title 41, Idaho Code, applicable to such in- vestments of insurers. (4) Whether any investment made pursuant to subsection (2) of this sec- tion meets the applicable requirements thereof is to be determined before the investment is made by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obliga- tions and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the day they were made, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends. (5) If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment therein made pursuant to this section within three (3) years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further time as the director may prescribe, unless at any time after the investment shall have been made the investment shall have met the requirements for investment un- der any other section of title 41, Idaho Code, and the insurer has so notified the director. 41 - 3804. ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF CONTROLLING INTEREST WITH DOMESTIC INSURER - - ACQUISITION OF MERGER OR DIVESTITURE OF CONTROLLING INTEREST WITH DOMESTIC INSURER.

The director shall determine those instances in which the party seeking to divest or to acquire a controlling interest in an insurer will be required to file for and obtain approval of the transaction. The information shall remain confidential until the conclusion of the transaction unless the director, in his discretion, determines that confidential treatment will interfere with or impede enforcement of this section. If the statement referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection is otherwise filed, this section shall not apply. (c) With respect to a transaction subject to this section, the acquir- ing or divesting person must also file a preacquisition notification with the director that contains the information set forth in section 41 - 3808(3)(a), Idaho Code, at least thirty (30) days prior to the pro- posed effective date of the acquisition. A failure to timely file the notification may subject the acquiring or divesting person to penalties as specified in section 41 - 3808(5)(e), Idaho Code.

APPROVAL BY DIRECTOR - - HEARINGS. (1) The director shall approve any purchase, exchange, merger or other acquisition of control referred to in section 41 - 3804(1), Idaho Code, or in section 41 - 3824, Idaho Code, unless, after a public hearing, the director finds that: (a) After the change of control, the domestic insurer referenced in section 41 - 3804(1), Idaho Code, would be unable to satisfy the re- quirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed; (b) The effect of the purchase, exchange, merger or other acquisition of control would substantially lessen competition in the business of insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly. In applying the competitive standard in this paragraph: (i) The informational requirements of section 41 - 3808(3)(a), Idaho Code, and the standards of section 41 - 3808(4)(b), Idaho Code, shall apply; 658 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 266 2013 (ii) The merger or other acquisition shall not be disapproved if the director finds that any of the situations meeting the criteria provided by section 41 - 3808(4)(c), Idaho Code, exist; and (iii) The director may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition on the removal of the basis of disapproval within a specified period of time; (c) The financial condition of any acquiring party may jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer or prejudice the interest of its pol- icyholders or, in the case of an acquisition of control, the interest of any remaining stockholders who are unaffiliated with the acquiring per- son; (d) The plans or proposals of the acquiring party to liquidate the in- surer, sell its assets or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and are not in the public interest; (e) The competence, experience and integrity of the persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders and stockholders of the insurer or of the pub- lic to permit the merger or other acquisition of control; or (f) The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the in- surance - buying public. (2) The public hearing referenced in subsection (1) of this section shall be held within thirty - five (35) days after the statement required by section 41 - 3804(1), Idaho Code, is filed or as otherwise agreed to by the director and the person filing the statement, and at least twenty - one (21) days' notice of such hearing shall be given by the director to the person filing the statement.

The director shall make a determination within fifty - six (56) days after conclusion of such hearing. At the hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose interest may be affected shall have the right to present evidence, examine and cross - examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and shall be entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as allowed under chapter 2, title 41, Idaho Code, and applicable rules. (3) If the proposed acquisition of control will require the approval of more than one (1) commissioner, the public hearing referenced in subsection (2) of this section may be held on a consolidated basis, upon written request to all affected commissioners by the person filing the statement referenced in section 41 - 3804(1), Idaho Code. Such person shall file the statement ref- erenced in section 41 - 3804(1), Idaho Code, with the national association of insurance commissioners within five (5) days of making the request for a pub- lic hearing. A commissioner may opt out of a consolidated hearing and shall provide notice to the applicant of the opt - out within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of the statement referenced in section 41 - 3804(1), Idaho Code. A hearing conducted on a consolidated basis shall be public and shall be held within the United States before the commissioners of the states in which the affected insurers are domiciled. Such commissioners shall hear and receive evidence. A commissioner may attend such hearing in person or by telecommu- nication. (4) In connection with a change of control of a domestic insurer, any determination by the director that the person acquiring control of the in- surer shall be required to maintain or restore the capital of the insurer to the level required by the laws and regulations of this state shall be made C. 266 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 659 not later than sixty (60) days after the date of notification of the change in control submitted pursuant to section 41 - 3804(1)(a) of this chapter. Fail- ure of the director to provide a determination within the prescribed time shall not negate the application of capital requirements otherwise required by title 41, Idaho Code, but may affect the time within which such require- ments must be met. (5) The director may retain at the acquiring person's expense any at- torneys, actuaries, accountants and other experts not otherwise a part of the director's staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist the director in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control. The director may require the acquiring party to post a bond in an amount not to exceed twenty - five thou- sand dollars ($25,000) as security for payment of such expenses. (6) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any offer, re- quest, invitation, agreement or acquisition that the director by order shall exempt as not having been made or entered into for the purpose and not having the effect of changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer, or as otherwise not anticipated by this section. (7) The following shall be violations of this section: (a) The failure to file any statement, amendment or other material re- quired to be filed pursuant to the provisions of section 41 - 3804(1) or (2), Idaho Code; or (b) The effectuation or any attempt to effectuate an acquisition of control of, divestiture of, or merger with a domestic insurer unless the director has given prior approval. (8) The district courts of the state of Idaho are hereby vested with jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled or authorized to do business in this state who files a statement with the director under the pro- visions of section 41 - 3804, Idaho Code, and over all actions involving such person arising out of violations of this section, and each such person shall be deemed to have performed acts equivalent to and constituting an appoint- ment by the person of the director to be his true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding aris- ing out of violations of this section. Copies of all lawful process shall be served on the director and transmitted by registered or certified mail by the director to the person at his last known address. 41 - 3807. MAILING - - PAYMENT OF EXPENSES. (1) All notices of public hearings held pursuant to section 41 - 3806, Idaho Code, shall be mailed by the insurer to its shareholders within five (5) business days after the insurer has received such notices. The expenses of such mailing shall be borne by the person making the filing. As security for the payment of such expenses, such person shall file with the director a bond or other deposit deemed acceptable and in an amount determined by the director. (2) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any offers, re- quests, invitations, agreements or acquisitions by the person referred to in section 41 - 3804, Idaho Code, of any voting security referred to in sec- tion 41 - 3804, Idaho Code, which, immediately prior to the consummation of such offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition, was not issued and outstanding. 41 - 3808.

(1) The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this section only: (a) \"Acquisition\" means any agreement, arrangement or activity, the consummation of which results in a person acquiring directly or indi- rectly the control of another person, and includes, but is not limited to, the acquisition of voting securities, the acquisition of assets, bulk reinsurance and mergers; 660 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 266 2013 (b) \"Involved insurer\" means an insurer that either acquires or is ac- quired, is affiliated with an acquirer or acquired, or is the result of a merger. (2) This section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in this state. This sec- tion shall not apply to the following: (a) An acquisition subject to approval or disapproval by the director pursuant to sections 41 - 3804 and 41 - 3806, Idaho Code; (b) A purchase of securities solely for investment purposes, so long as the securities are not used by voting or otherwise to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of competition in any insurance mar- ket in this state. If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control under the provisions of section 41 - 3802(2), Idaho Code, it is not solely for investment purposes unless the commissioner of the in- surer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirma- tively finds that control does not exist, and the disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the director; (c) The acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if preacquisition notification is filed with the director in accordance with subsection (3)(a) of this section thirty (30) days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition. How- ever, such preacquisition notification is not required for exclusion from this section if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded from this section by any other subsection of this section; (d) The acquisition of already affiliated persons; (e) An acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition: (i) In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceeds five percent (5%) of the total market; (ii) There would be no increase in any market share; or (iii) In no market would: 1. The combined market share of the involved insurers ex- ceeds twelve percent (12%) of the total market; and 2. The market share increases by more than two percent (2%) of the total market. For the purpose of paragraph (e) of this subsection, a market means di- rect written insurance premium in this state for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers li- censed to do business in this state; (f) An acquisition for which a preacquisition notification would be re- quired pursuant to the provisions of this section due solely to the re- sulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business; or (g) An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary commissioner affir- matively finds that the insurer is in failing condition; there is a lack of feasible alternative to improving such condition; the public bene- fits of improving the insurer's condition through the acquisition ex- ceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competi- tion; and the findings are communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the director. (3) An acquisition covered by subsection (2) of this section may be subject to the issuance of an order pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, unless the acquiring person files a preacquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The acquired person may file a preacqui- sition notification with the director. The director shall give confidential treatment to information submitted under the provisions of this subsection in the same manner as provided in section 41 - 3816, Idaho Code. (a) The preacquisition notification shall be in such form and contain such information as prescribed by the director relating to those mar- C. 266 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 661 kets which, under subsection (2)(e) of this section, cause the acquisi- tion not to be exempted from the provisions of this section. The direc- tor may require such additional material and information as deemed nec- essary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive standard of subsection (4) of this sec- tion. The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state accompa- nied by a summary of the education and experience of such person indi- cating his ability to render an informed opinion. (b) The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt by the director of a preacquisition notification and shall end on the ear- lier of the thirtieth day after the date of receipt or termination of the waiting period by the director. Prior to the end of the waiting period, the director may require the submission of additional needed informa- tion relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after receipt of the additional information by the director or termination of the wait- ing period by the director. (4) (a) The director may enter an order under subsection (5)(a) of this section with respect to an acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be substantially to lessen compe- tition in any line of insurance in this state or tend to create a monop- oly, or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with subsection (3) of this section. (b) In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive standard of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the director shall consider the following: (i) Any acquisition covered under subsection (2) of this section involving two (2) or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards. 1. If the market is highly concentrated and the involved in- surers possess the following shares of the market: Insurer A Insurer B 4% 4% or more 10% 2% or more 15% 1% or more 2. Or, if the market is not highly concentrated and the in- volved insurers possess the following shares of the market: Insurer A Insurer B 5% 5% or more or more 15% 3% or more 19% 1% or more A highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the four (4) largest insurers is seventy - five percent (75%) or more of the market. Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown. If more than two (2) insurers are involved, exceed- ing the total of the two (2) columns in the table is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in paragraph (a) of this subsection. For the purpose of this determination, the insurer with the largest share of the market shall be deemed to be insurer A. 662 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 266 2013 (ii) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest in- surers in the market, from the two (2) largest to the eight (8) largest, has increased by seven percent (7%) or more of the mar- ket over a period of time extending from any base year five (5) to ten (10) years prior to the acquisition up to the time of the ac- quisition. Any acquisition or merger covered under subsection (2) of this section involving two (2) or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competi- tive standard in paragraph (a) of this subsection if: 1. There is a significant trend toward increased concentra- tion in the market; 2. One (1) of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share; and 3. Another involved insurer's market is two percent (2%) or more. (iii) For the purposes of paragraph (b) of this subsection: 1. \"Insurer\" means any company or group of companies under common management, ownership or control; 2. \"Market\" means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geograph- ical markets, the director shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, which line is that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in this state and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be this state; 3. The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard rests upon the director. (iv) Even if an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subsection (4)(b)(i) and (ii) of this section, the director may establish the requisite anticompeti- tive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Even if an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subsection (4)(b)(i) and (ii) of this section, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Relevant factors in making a determination under this subsection include, but are not limited to, the following: market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concen- tration in the industry and ease of entry and exit into the market. (c) An order may not be entered under subsection (5)(a) of this section if: (i) The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that cannot be feasibly achieved in any other way, and the public benefits that would arise from such economies exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition; or (ii) The acquisition will substantially increase the availabil- ity of insurance, and the public benefits of the increase exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competi- tion. C. 266 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 663 (5) (a) If an acquisition violates the provisions of this section, the director may enter an order: (i) Requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in this state with respect to the line or lines of insur- ance involved in the violation; or (ii) Denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a certificate of authority to do business in this state. (b) Such an order shall not be entered unless: (i) A hearing has been held in accordance with chapter 2, title 41, Idaho Code; (ii) Notice of the hearing was issued prior to the end of the wait- ing period and not less than fourteen (14) days prior to the hear- ing; and (iii) The hearing was concluded and the order issued no later than fifty - six (56) days after the date of the filing of the preacquisi- tion notification with the director. Every order shall be accompanied by a written decision of the director setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law. (c) An order entered under the provisions of this subsection shall not become final earlier than twenty - eight (28) days after it is issued, during which time the involved insurer may submit a plan to remedy the anticompetitive impact of the acquisition within a reasonable time. Based upon such plan or other information, the director shall specify the conditions, if any, under the time period during which the aspects of the acquisition causing a violation of the provisions of this section would be remedied and the order vacated or modified. (d) An order pursuant to this section shall not apply if the acquisition is not consummated. (e) Any person who violates a cease and desist order of the director is- sued pursuant to subsection (5)(a) of this section and while the order is in effect may, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing and upon order of the director, be subject at the discretion of the director to one (1) or more of the following: (i) A monetary penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for every day of violation; and/or (ii) Suspension or revocation of the person's certificate of au- thority in this state. (f) Any insurer or other person who fails to make any filing required by this section, and who also fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with any filing requirement, shall be subject to a fine of not more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). (6) Sections 41 - 3818(2) and (3) and 41 - 3820, Idaho Code, do not apply to acquisitions covered under subsection (2) of this section. 41 - 3809. REGISTRATION OF HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM INSURERS. (1) Every insurer authorized to do business in this state and that is a member of an insurance holding company system shall register with the director, except a foreign insurer subject to registration requirements and standards adopted by statute or regulation in the jurisdiction of its domicile, which are sub- stantially similar to those contained in this section and in: (a) Sections 41 - 3810(1), 41 - 3811 and 41 - 3812, Idaho Code; and (b) The provisions of section 41 - 3810(2), Idaho Code, or a provision such as the following: Each registered insurer shall keep current the information required to be disclosed in its registration statement by reporting all material changes or additions within fifteen (15) days after the end of the month in which it learns of each change or addition. Any insurer that is subject to registration under this section shall regis- ter within fifteen (15) days after it becomes subject to registration, and annually thereafter for the year ending December 31 immediately preceding, 664 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 266 2013 on the due date provided for filing of audited financial reports, or, if the insurer is not subject to filing of audited financial reports, on June 1, un- less the director, for good cause shown, extends the time for registration, and then within the extended time. The director may require any insurer au- thorized to do business in the state that is a member of an insurance holding company system, and which is not subject to registration under this section, to furnish a copy of the registration statement, the summary specified in subsection (3) of this section or other information filed by the insurance company with the insurance regulatory authority of its domiciliary juris- diction. Upon request of the insurer or of the insurance regulatory author- ity of another jurisdiction in which the insurer is authorized to transact insurance, the director at the insurer's expense shall furnish a copy of the registration statement or other information filed by a domestic insurer with the director pursuant to this chapter. (2) Every insurer subject to registration under this chapter shall file the registration statement with the director on a form and in a manner pre- scribed by the director. The registration statement shall contain the fol- lowing current information: (a) The capital structure, general financial condition, ownership and management of the insurer and any person controlling the insurer; (b) The identity and relationship of every member of the insurance holding company system; (c) The following agreements in force and transactions currently out- standing or that have occurred during the last calendar year between the insurer and its affiliates: (i) Loans, other investments or purchases, sales or exchanges of securities of the affiliates by the insurer or of the insurer by its affiliates; (ii) Purchases, sales or exchange of assets; (iii) Transactions not in the ordinary course of business; (iv) Guarantees or undertakings for the benefit of an affiliate that result in an actual contingent exposure of the insurer's as- sets to liability, other than insurance contracts entered into in the ordinary course of the insurer's business; (v) All management agreements, service contracts and all cost - sharing arrangements; (vi) Reinsurance agreements; (vii) Dividends and other distributions to shareholders; and (viii) Consolidated tax allocation agreements. (d) Any pledge of the insurer's stock, including stock of any sub- sidiary or controlling affiliate, for a loan made to any member of the insurance holding company system; (e) If requested by the director, the insurer shall provide to the di- rector financial statements of or within an insurance holding company system, including all affiliates. Financial statements may include, but are not limited to, annual audited financial statements filed with the U.S. securities and exchange commission (SEC) pursuant to the secu- rities act of 1933, as amended, or the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. An insurer required to file financial statements pursuant to this section may satisfy the request by providing the director with the most recently filed parent corporation financial statements that have been filed with the SEC; (f) Other matters concerning transactions between registered insurers and any affiliates as may be included from time to time in any registra- tion forms adopted or approved by the director; (g) Certification that the insurer's board of directors is responsible for and oversees corporate governance and internal controls and that the insurer's officers or senior management have approved, implemented C. 266 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 665 and continue to maintain and monitor corporate governance and internal control procedures; and (h) Any other information required by the director by statute or rule. (3) All registration statements shall contain a summary outlining all items constituting changes from the prior registration statement. (4) No information need be disclosed on the registration statement filed pursuant to subsection (2) of this section if the information is not material for the purposes of this section. Unless the director by rule or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, investments or guarantees involving one - half of one percent (.5%) or less of an insurer's admitted assets as of the December 31 of the year immediately preceding shall not be deemed material for purposes of this chapter. (5) Subject to section 41 - 3810, Idaho Code, each registered insurer shall report to the director all dividends and other distributions to shareholders within fifteen (15) business days following the declaration thereof. (6) Any person within an insurance holding company system subject to registration shall be required to provide complete and accurate information to an insurer, where the information is reasonably necessary to enable the insurer to comply with the provisions of this chapter. (7) The director shall terminate the registration of any insurer that demonstrates that it no longer is a member of an insurance holding company system. (8) The director may require or allow two (2) or more affiliated insur- ers subject to registration to file a consolidated registration statement. (9) The director may allow any insurer that is authorized to do business in this state and that is part of an insurance holding company system, to reg- ister on behalf of any affiliated insurer that is required to register under subsection (1) of this section and to comply with all filing requirements un- der this chapter. (10) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any insurer, in- formation or transaction if and to the extent that the director by rule or order shall exempt the same from the provisions of this section. In consid- ering whether to issue an exemption, the director may consider the follow- ing: (a) The size of the insurer and all affiliates; (b) The structure of ownership within the insurance holding company system; (c) The nature and amounts of transactions within the insurance holding company system; (d) The nature and complexity of the business of the insurer and affili- ates; and (e) Any other factors the director deems appropriate. Prior to issuing an exemption, the director shall notify all other insurance regulators where the insurer or its affiliates hold a certificate of author- ity. (11) Any person may file with the director a disclaimer of affiliation with any authorized insurer, or such a disclaimer may be filed by the insurer or any member of an insurance holding company system. The disclaimer shall fully disclose all material relationships and bases for affiliation between the person and the insurer as well as the basis for disclaiming the affiliation. A disclaimer of affiliation shall be deemed to have been granted unless the director, within thirty (30) days following receipt of a complete disclaimer, notifies the filing party that the disclaimer is disallowed. In the event of disallowance, the disclaiming party may request an administrative hearing pursuant to chapter 2, title 41, Idaho Code, which shall be granted. The disclaiming party shall be relieved of its duty to 666 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 266 2013 register under this section if approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the director, or if the disclaimer is deemed to have been approved. (12) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to regis- tration shall also file an annual enterprise risk report. The report shall, to the best of the ultimate controlling person's knowledge and belief, identify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer. The report shall be filed with the lead state director of the insurance holding company system as determined by the procedures within the financial analysis handbook adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners. (13) The failure to file a registration statement or any summary of the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required in this section within the time specified for filing shall be a violation of the provisions of this section. 41 - 3810. STANDARDS AND MANAGEMENT OF AN INSURER WITHIN AN INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEM. (1) Transactions within an insurance holding com- pany system to which an insurer subject to registration is a party shall be subject to the following standards: (a) The terms shall be fair and reasonable; (b) Agreements for cost - sharing services and management shall include such provisions as required by rule promulgated by the director; (c) Charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable; (d) Expenses incurred and payment received shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with customary insurance accounting practices consistently applied; (e) The books, accounts and records of each party to all such trans- actions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the precise nature and details of the transactions, including such accounting information as is necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees to the respective parties; and (f) The insurer's surplus regarding policyholders following any divi- dends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs. (2) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and any person in its insurance holding company system, including amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed pursuant to this section, that are subject to any materiality standards contained in para- graphs (a) through (g) of this subsection, may not be entered into unless the insurer has notified the director in writing of its intention to enter into the transaction at least thirty (30) days prior thereto, or such shorter period as the director may permit, and the director has not disapproved it within that period. The notice for amendments or modifications shall include the reasons for the change and the financial impact on the domestic insurer. Informal notice shall be reported to the director within thirty (30) days after the termination of a previously filed agreement, for deter- mination of the type of filing required, if any. (a) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans, extensions of credit, guaran- tees or investments, provided the transactions are equal to or exceed: (i) With respect to non - life insurers, the lesser of three per- cent (3%) of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty - five percent (25%) of surplus regarding policyholders as of December 31 of the year immediately preceding; (ii) With respect to life insurers, three percent (3%) of the in- surer's admitted assets as of December 31 of the year immediately preceding; (b) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes loans or extensions of credit with the agree- C. 266 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 667 ment or understanding that the proceeds of the transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affil- iate of the insurer making the loans or extensions of credit, provided the transactions are equal to or exceed: (i) With respect to non - life insurers, the lesser of three per- cent (3%) of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty - five percent (25%) of surplus regarding policyholders as of December 31 of the year immediately preceding; (ii) With respect to life insurers, three percent (3%) of the in- surer's admitted assets as of December 31 of the year immediately preceding; (c) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including: (i) All reinsurance pooling agreements; (ii) Agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities, in any of the next three (3) years, equals or exceeds five percent (5%) of the insurer's surplus regarding policyholders, as of December 31 of the year im- mediately preceding, including those agreements which may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a non- affiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the in- surer and the nonaffiliate that any portion of the assets will be transferred to one (1) or more affiliates of the insurer; (d) All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements, guarantees and all cost - sharing arrangements; (e) Guarantees when made by a domestic insurer, provided however, that a guarantee that is quantifiable as to amount is not subject to the notice requirement of this section, unless it exceeds the lesser of one - half of one percent (.5%) of the insurer's admitted assets or ten percent (10%) of surplus regarding policyholders as of December 31 of the year immediately preceding. Further, all guarantees that are not quantifiable as to amount are subject to the notice requirements of this section; (f) Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in a person that controls the insurer or in an affiliate of the insurer in an amount that, together with the insurer's present holdings in such investments, exceeds two and one - half percent (2.5%) of the insurer's surplus to policyholders. Direct or indirect acquisitions or investments in subsidiaries acquired pursuant to section 41 - 3803, Idaho Code, or authorized under any other section of this chapter, or in nonsubsidiary insurance affiliates that are subject to the provisions of this chap- ter, are exempt from this requirement; and (g) Any material transactions, specified by statute or rule, that the director determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transactions that, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same insur- ance holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law. (3) A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would oc- cur otherwise. If the director determines that separate transactions were entered into over any twelve (12) month period for that purpose, the director may exercise his authority pursuant to section 41 - 3819, Idaho Code. (4) The director, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, shall consider whether the transactions comply with the 668 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 266 2013 standards set forth in subsection (1) of this section and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders. (5) The director shall be notified within thirty (30) days of any in- vestment of the domestic insurer in any one (1) corporation, if the total in- vestment in the corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds ten percent (10%) of the corporation's voting securities. 41 - 3811. ADEQUACY OF SURPLUS. For purposes of this chapter, in deter- mining whether an insurer's surplus regarding policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be consid- ered: (1) The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and sur- plus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and other appropriate criteria; (2) The extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among several lines of insurance; (3) The number and size of risks insured in each line of business; (4) The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risks; (5) The nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program; (6) The quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio; (7) The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the in- surer's investment portfolio; (8) The surplus regarding policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers; (9) The adequacy of the insurer's reserves; (10) The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates; the direc- tor may treat any investment in an affiliate as a disallowed asset for pur- poses of determining the adequacy of surplus regarding policyholders when- ever in the judgment of the director the investment so warrants; and (11) The quality of the insurer's earnings and the extent to which the reported earnings include extraordinary items. 41 - 3812. DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS. (1) No domestic insurer shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distri- bution to its shareholders until thirty (30) days after the director has re- ceived notice of the declaration thereof and has not within that period dis- approved the payment, or until the director has approved the payment within the thirty (30) day period. For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other divi- dends or distributions made within the preceding twelve (12) months exceeds the lesser of: (a) Ten percent (10%) of the insurer's surplus regarding policyholders as of December 31 of the year immediately preceding; or (b) The net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurer, or the net income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, not in- cluding realized capital gains, for the twelve (12) month period ending December 31 of the year immediately preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an in- surer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previ- ous two (2) calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carryforward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extra- C. 266 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 669 ordinary dividend or distribution that is conditional upon the director's approval, and the declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders un- til the director has approved the payment of the dividend or distribution or until the director has not disapproved payment within the thirty (30) day pe- riod referred to in this subsection. (2) A domestic insurer that is a member of a holding company system shall notify the director in writing of any nonextraordinary dividends to be paid or other distributions to be made to shareholders within five (5) business days following the declaration of the dividend or distribution, and shall notify the director in writing at least ten (10) days, commencing from the date of receipt by the director, prior to the payment of any dividends or the making of any other distribution. 41 - 3813. MANAGEMENT OF DOMESTIC INSURERS SUBJECT TO REGISTRATION. (1) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any person, the offi- cers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be relieved of any obli- gation or liability to which they would otherwise be subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate operating identity con- sistent with this chapter. (2) Nothing in this section shall preclude a domestic insurer from hav- ing or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property or services with one (1) or more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of section 41 - 3810(1), Idaho Code. (3) Not less than one - third (1/3) of the directors of a domestic in- surer, and not less than one - third (1/3) of the members of each committee of the board of directors of any domestic insurer, shall be persons who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, con- trolled by or under common control with the insurer and who are not benefi- cial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or entity. At least one (1) person must be included in any quorum for the trans- action of business at any meeting of the board of directors or any committee thereof. (4) The board of directors of a domestic insurer shall establish one (1) or more committees comprised solely of directors who are not officers or em- ployees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial owners of a con- trolling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or any such entity. The committee or committees shall have responsibility for nominating candidates for director for election by shareholders or policyholders, evaluating the performance of officers deemed to be principal officers of the insurer and recommending to the board of directors the selection and compensation of the principal officers. (5) The provisions of subsections (3) and (4) of this section shall not apply to a domestic insurer if the person controlling the insurer, such as an insurer, a mutual insurance holding company or a publicly held corporation, has a board of directors and committees thereof that meet the requirements of subsections (3) and (4) of this section with respect to such controlling entity. (6) An insurer may make application to the director for a waiver from the requirements of this section, if the insurer's annual direct written and assumed premium, excluding premiums reinsured with the federal crop insur- ance corporation and federal flood program, is less than three hundred mil- lion dollars ($300,000,000). An insurer may also make application to the di- rector for a waiver from the requirements of this section based upon unique circumstances. The director may consider various factors including, but not limited to, the type of business entity, volume of business written, avail- ability of qualified board members or the ownership or organizational struc- ture of the entity. 670 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 266 2013 41 - 3814. EXAMINATION. (1) Power of director. Subject to the limita- tion contained in this section and in addition to the authority the direc- tor has under chapter 2, title 41, Idaho Code, relating to the examination of insurers, the director shall have the power to examine any insurer reg- istered under section 41 - 3809, Idaho Code, and its affiliates to ascertain the financial condition of the insurer, including the enterprise risk to the insurer by the ultimate controlling party, or by any entity or combination of entities within the insurance holding company system, or by the insurance holding company system on a consolidated basis. (2) The director may order any insurer registered under section 41 - 3809, Idaho Code, to produce such records, books or other information in the possession or control of the insurer or its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. For such purpose, the director may order any insurer registered under section 41 - 3809, Idaho Code, to produce information not in the possession of the insurer if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant to contractual relationships, statutory obligations or other method. In the event the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the director, the insurer shall provide the director with a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot obtain the information and the identity of the holder of information. Whenever it appears to the director that the detailed explanation is without merit, the director may require, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, that the insurer pay a penalty in the amount and in the manner provided in section 41 - 3819(1), Idaho Code, and may suspend or revoke the insurer's license. (3) The director may retain at the registered insurer's expense such attorneys, actuaries, accountants and other experts not otherwise a part of the director's staff as shall be reasonably necessary to assist in the con- duct of the examination referenced in subsection (1) of this section.

The director shall also have the power to issue subpoenas, to administer oaths and to examine under oath any per- son for purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of this sec- tion. Upon the failure or refusal of any person to obey a subpoena issued by the director, the director may petition a court of competent jurisdiction and, upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the wit- ness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be punishable as contempt of court. Every person shall be obligated to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. He shall be entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in the district court, which fees, mileage and actual expense, if any, necessarily incurred in securing the at- tendance of witnesses, and their testimony, shall be itemized and charged against and be paid by the company being examined. 41 - 3815.

(3) In order to assess the business strategy, financial position, legal and regulatory position, risk exposure, risk management and governance pro- cesses, and as part of the examination of individual insurers in accordance with section 41 - 3813, Idaho Code, the director may participate in a supervi- sory college with other regulators charged with supervision of the insurer or its affiliates, including other state, federal and international regu- latory agencies. The director may enter into agreements in accordance with section 41 - 3816(3), Idaho Code, providing the basis for cooperation among the director and the other regulatory agencies, and the activities of the supervisory college.

(2) No security that is the subject of any agreement or arrangement re- garding acquisition, or that is acquired or to be acquired, in contravention of the provisions of this chapter or of any rule or order issued by the direc- tor hereunder, may be voted at any shareholders' meeting, or may be counted for quorum purposes, and any action of shareholders requiring the affirma- tive vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though the securities were not issued and outstanding; however, no action taken at any such meet- ing shall be invalidated by the voting of such securities, unless the action would materially affect control of the insurer or unless the courts of this state so order. If an insurer or the director has reason to believe that any security of the insurer has been or is about to be acquired in contra- vention of the provisions of this chapter or of any rule or order issued by the director hereunder, the insurer or the director may apply to the fourth judicial district court for Ada county to enjoin any offer, request, invi- tation, agreement or acquisition made in contravention of section 41 - 3804, Idaho Code, or any rule or order issued by the director to enjoin the voting of any security so acquired, to void any vote of the security already cast at any meeting of shareholders, and for such other equitable relief as the na- ture of the case and the interest of the insurer's policyholders, creditors and shareholders or the public may require. (3) In any case where a person has acquired or is proposing to acquire any voting securities in violation of the provisions of this chapter or any rule or order issued by the director hereunder, the fourth judicial district court for Ada county, on such notice as the court deems appropriate, upon the application of the insurer or the director, shall seize or sequester any vot- ing securities of the insurer owned directly or indirectly by the person, and issue such order as may be appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this chapter.

The maximum penalty under this section is ten thousand dollars ($10,000). The director may reduce the penalty if the insurer demonstrates to the director that the imposition of the penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer. (2) Every director or officer of an insurance holding company system who knowingly violates, participates in or assents to, or who knowingly per- mits any of the officers or agents of the insurer to engage in transactions or make investments that have not been properly reported or submitted pursuant to section 41 - 3809(1), 41 - 3810(2) or 41 - 3812, Idaho Code, or who violates the provisions of this chapter shall pay, in their individual capacity, an administrative penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) per violation, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing before the direc- tor. In determining the amount of the administrative penalty, the director shall take into account the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the gravity of the violation, the history of any previous violations and such other matters as the interests of justice may require. (3) Whenever it appears to the director that any insurer subject to this chapter or any director, officer, employee or agent thereof has engaged in any transaction or entered into a contract that is subject to section 41 - 3810 or 41 - 3812, Idaho Code, and that would not have been approved had approval been requested, the director may order the insurer to cease and desist imme- diately from any further activity under that transaction or contract.

(5) Any officer, director or employee of an insurance holding company system who willfully and knowingly subscribes to or makes or causes to be made any false statements or false reports or false filings with the intent to deceive the director in the performance of his duties under the provisions of this chapter, upon conviction shall be imprisoned for not more than three (3) years or fined five thousand dollars ($5,000), or both. Any fines im- posed shall be paid by the officer, director or employee in his individual capacity. (6) Whenever it appears to the director that any person has committed a violation of the provisions of section 41 - 3804, Idaho Code, and which pre- vents the director from fully understanding the enterprise risk to the in- surer by affiliates or by the insurance holding company system, such vio- lation may serve as an independent basis for the director's disapproval of dividends or distributions and for placing the insurer under an order of su- pervision in accordance with chapter 33, title 41, Idaho Code. 41 - 3820. RECEIVERSHIP. Whenever it appears to the director that any person has committed a violation of the provisions of this chapter that so impairs the financial condition of a domestic insurer as to threaten insol- C. 266 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 675 vency or make its further transaction of business hazardous to its policy- holders, creditors, shareholders or the public, the director may proceed as provided in chapter 33, title 41, Idaho Code, to take possession of the prop- erty of the domestic insurer and to conduct its business in the capacity of a receiver. 41 - 3821. RECOVERY. (1) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a domestic insurer has been entered, the receiver appointed under the or- der shall be authorized to recover on behalf of the insurer: (a) From any parent corporation or holding company or person or affili- ate who otherwise controlled the insurer, the amount of distributions, other than distributions of shares of the same class of stock, paid by the insurer on its capital stock; or (b) Any payment in the form of a bonus, termination settlement or ex- traordinary lump sum salary adjustment made by the insurer or its sub- sidiary to a director, officer or employee, where the distribution or payment pursuant to this subsection is made at any time during the one (1) year period preceding the petition for liquidation, conservation or rehabilitation, as the case may be, subject to the limitations of sub- sections (2), (3) and (4) of this section. (2) No distribution shall be recoverable if the parent or affiliate of such domestic insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the in- surer to fulfill its contractual obligations. (3) Any person who was a parent corporation or holding company or a per- son who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate at the time the distri- butions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions or pay- ments under subsection (1) of this section, that the person received. Any person who otherwise controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared shall be liable up to the amount of distributions that would have been received if they had been paid immediately. If two (2) or more per- sons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable. (4) The maximum amount recoverable pursuant to this section shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired or in- solvent insurer and to reimburse any guaranty funds. (5) To the extent that any person liable under subsection (3) of this section is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay claims due pursuant to subsec- tion (3) of this section, its parent corporation or holding company or per- son who otherwise controlled it at the time the distribution was paid shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the parent corporation or holding company or person who oth- erwise controlled it. 41 - 3822. REVOCATION, SUSPENSION OR NONRENEWAL OF INSURER'S LI- CENSE.

MUTUAL INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES. (1) (a) A domestic mutual insurer, upon approval of the director, may reorganize by forming an insurance holding company system, which shall be designated as \"a mutual insurance holding company,\" based upon a mutual insurance company plan and continuing the corporate existence of the reorganizing insurer as a stock insurer. The director, after a public hearing as provided in section 41 - 3806, Idaho Code, if satisfied that the interests of the policyholders are properly protected and that the plan of reorganization is fair and equitable to the policyholders, may approve the proposed plan of reorganization and may require as a condition of approval such modifications of the proposed plan of reorganization as the director finds necessary for the protection of the policyholders' interests. The director may retain consultants for this purpose as provided in section 41 - 3806(5), Idaho Code. A reor- ganization pursuant to this section is subject to the requirements of sections 41 - 3804 and 41 - 3805, Idaho Code. The director shall retain ju- risdiction over a mutual insurance holding company organized pursuant to this section to assure that policyholder interests are protected. (b) All of the initial shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer shall be issued to the mutual insurance holding company. The membership interests of the policyholders of the reorganized insurer shall become membership interests in the mutual insurance holding com- pany. Policyholders of the reorganized insurer shall be members of the mutual insurance holding company in accordance with the articles of in- corporation and bylaws of the mutual insurance holding company. The mu- tual insurance holding company shall at all times own a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer. (2) (a) A domestic mutual insurer, upon the approval of the director, may reorganize by merging its policyholders' membership interests into a mutual insurance holding company formed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and continuing the corporate existence of the reorganizing insurer as a stock insurer subsidiary of the mutual insurance holding company. The director, after a public hearing as provided in section 41 - 3806, Idaho Code, if satisfied that the interests of the policyhold- ers are properly protected and that the merger is fair and equitable to the policyholders, may approve the proposed merger and may require as a condition of approval such modifications of the proposed merger as the director finds necessary for the protection of the policyholders' in- terests. For this purpose, the director may retain consultants as pro- vided in section 41 - 3806(5), Idaho Code. A merger pursuant to this sub- section is subject to sections 41 - 3804 and 41 - 3805, Idaho Code.

A merger of policyholders' membership interests in a mutual insurer into a mutual insurance holding company shall be deemed to be a merger of insurance companies pursuant to section 41 - 2857, Idaho Code, and is subject to the requirements of section 41 - 2857, Idaho Code. (c) A foreign mutual insurer that is a domestic insurer organized under chapter 3, title 41, Idaho Code, may reorganize upon the approval of the director and in compliance with the requirements of any law or rule applicable to the foreign mutual insurer by merging its policyholders' membership interests into a mutual insurance holding company formed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and continuing the corporate existence of the reorganizing foreign mutual insurer as a foreign stock insurer subsidiary of the mutual insurance holding company. The director, after a public hearing as provided in section 41 - 3806, Idaho Code, may approve the proposed merger. The director may retain consultants as provided in section 41 - 3806(5), Idaho Code. A merger pursuant to this paragraph is subject to the requirements of sections 41 - 3804 and 41 - 3805, Idaho Code. The reorganizing foreign mutual insurer may remain a foreign company or foreign corporation after the merger and may be admitted to do business in this state, upon approval by the director. A foreign mutual insurer that is a party to the merger may at the same time redomesticate in this state by complying with the applicable requirements of this state and its state of domicile. The provisions of subsection (2)(b) of this section shall apply to a merger authorized under this paragraph. (3) A mutual insurance holding company resulting from the reorganiza- tion of a domestic mutual insurer organized under chapter 1, title 30, Idaho Code, shall be incorporated pursuant to chapter 1, title 30, Idaho Code. This requirement shall supersede any conflicting provisions of chapter 1, title 30, Idaho Code. The articles of incorporation and any amendments to such articles of the mutual insurance holding company shall be subject to approval of the director in the same manner as those of an insurance company. (4) A mutual insurance holding company is deemed to be an insurer sub- ject to chapter 33, title 41, Idaho Code, and shall automatically be a party to any proceeding under chapter 33, title 41, Idaho Code, involving an in- surer that, as a result of a reorganization pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) of this section, is a subsidiary of the mutual insurance holding company. In any proceeding under chapter 33, title 41, Idaho Code, involving the re- organized insurer, the assets of the mutual insurance holding company are deemed to be assets of the estate of the reorganized insurer for purposes of satisfying the claims of the reorganized insurer's policyholders. A mutual insurance holding company shall not be dissolved or liquidated without the prior approval of the director or as ordered by the district court pursuant to chapter 33, title 41, Idaho Code. (5) (a) Section 41 - 2855, Idaho Code, is not applicable to a reorganiza- tion or merger pursuant to this section. (b) Section 41 - 2855, Idaho Code, is applicable to demutualization of a mutual insurance holding company that resulted from the reorganiza- tion of a domestic mutual insurer organized pursuant to chapter 3, title 41, Idaho Code, as if the domestic mutual insurer were a mutual life in- surer. 678 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 266 2013 (6) A membership interest in a domestic mutual insurance holding com- pany shall not constitute a security as defined in section 30 - 14 - 102(28), Idaho Code. (7) The majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the reor- ganized insurer, which is required by this section to be at all times owned by a mutual insurance holding company, shall not be conveyed, transferred, assigned, pledged, subject to a security interest or lien, encumbered or otherwise hypothecated or alienated by the mutual insurance holding company or intermediate holding company. Any conveyance, transfer, assignment, pledge, security interest, lien, encumbrance, hypothecation or alienation of, in or on the majority of the voting shares of the reorganized insurer that is required by this section to be at all times owned by a mutual insurance holding company, is in violation of the provisions of this section and shall be void in inverse chronological order of the date of such conveyance, transfer, assignment, pledge, security interest, lien, encumbrance or hypothecation or alienation, as to the shares necessary to constitute a majority of such voting shares. The majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer that is required by this section to be at all times owned by a mutual insurance holding company shall not be subject to execution and levy as provided in title 11, Idaho Code. The shares of the capital stock of the surviving or new company resulting from a merger or consolidation of two (2) or more reorganized insurers or two (2) or more intermediate holding companies that were subsidiaries of the same mutual insurance holding company are subject to the same requirements, re- strictions and limitations as provided in this section to which the shares of the merging or consolidating reorganized insurers or intermediate holding companies were subject as provided in this section prior to the merger or consolidation. (a) As used in this section, \"majority of the voting shares of the capi- tal stock of the reorganized insurer\" means shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer that carry the right to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all of the outstanding shares of the capi- tal stock of the reorganized insurer for the election of directors and on all other matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the re- organized insurer. The ownership of a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer that is required pursuant to this section to be at all times owned by a parent mutual insurance holding company includes indirect ownership through one (1) or more in- termediate holding companies in a corporate structure approved by the director. However, indirect ownership through one (1) or more interme- diate holding companies shall not result in the mutual insurance hold- ing company owning less than the equivalent of a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock of the reorganized insurer. The director shall have jurisdiction over an intermediate holding company as if it were a mutual insurance holding company. (b) As used in this section, \"intermediate holding company\" means a holding company that is a subsidiary of a mutual insurance holding company and that either directly or through a subsidiary intermediate holding company has one (1) or more subsidiary - reorganized insurers of which a majority of the voting shares of the capital stock would otherwise have been required pursuant to this section to be at all times owned by the mutual insurance holding company. (8) It is the intent of the legislature that the formation of a mutual insurance holding company shall not increase the Idaho tax burden of the mu- tual insurance holding company system and that a stock insurance subsidiary shall continue to be subject to Idaho insurance premium taxation in lieu of all other taxes except real property taxes as provided in section 41 - 405, Idaho Code. Subject to approval by the director as required under Idaho law, a stock insurance subsidiary may issue dividends or distributions to the mu- C. 266 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 679 tual insurance holding company or any intermediate holding company and such dividends or distributions shall be excluded from the Idaho taxable income of the recipients; provided however, that such exclusion shall not apply if, in the year preceding the year in which the dividends or distributions were made, the subsidiary insurer's liability for Idaho premium tax was less than the amount of Idaho income tax, computed after allowance for income tax cred- its, for which the insurer would have been liable in such year had the insurer been subject to Idaho income taxation rather than premium taxation. 41 - 3825. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this chapter are hereby de- clared to be severable and if any provision of this chapter or the applica- tion of such provision to any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter.

Such salary savings could result from turnover and attrition, or be the result of innovation and reorganization efforts that create savings. Such savings should be reinvested in employees. Agencies are cautioned to use one - time funding for one - time payments and ongoing funding for permanent pay increases. Approved April 3, 2013. CHAPTER 274 (H.B.

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho: SECTION 1. That Section 63 - 602W, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 63 - 602W. BUSINESS INVENTORY EXEMPT FROM TAXATION - - BUSINESS IN- VENTORY THAT IS A COMPONENT OF REAL PROPERTY THAT IS A SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING. The following property is exempt from property taxation: business inventory. For the purpose of this section, \"business inventory\" means all items of tangible personal property or other property, including site improvements, described as: (1) All livestock, fur - bearing animals, fish, fowl and bees. (2) All nursery stock, stock - in - trade, merchandise, products, fin- ished or partly finished goods, raw materials, and all forest products subject to the provisions of chapter 17, title 63, Idaho Code, supplies, containers and other personal property which that is held for sale or con- sumption in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's manufacturing, farming, wholesale jobbing, or merchandising business. (3) Residential improvements never occupied. Once residential im- provements are occupied as defined in section 63 - 317, Idaho Code, they shall C. 276 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 715 be subject to the tax provided by section 63 - 317, Idaho Code. The provisions of section 63 - 602Y, Idaho Code, shall not apply to the exemption provided by this subsection. The exemption provided by this subsection applies only to improvements to real property, and only until first occupied. For purposes of this section, the term \"residential improvements\" means only: (a) Single family residences; or (b) Residential townhouses; or (c) Residential condominium units. The nonresidential portion of an improvement to real property that is used or is to be used for residential and nonresidential purposes does not qualify for the exemption provided by this section. If an improvement contains mul- tiple residential units, each such unit shall lose the exemption provided in this section when it becomes occupied. (4) Site improvements , that are associated with land, such as roads and utilities, on real property held by the land developer , either as owner or vendee in possession under a land sale contract, for sale or consumption in the ordinary course of the land developer's business until other improve- ments, such as buildings or structural components of buildings, are begun or title to the land the real property is conveyed from to a third party. For purposes of this subsection, a transfer of title to real property to a le- gal entity of which at least fifty percent (50%) is owned by the land devel- oper , the land developer's original entity or the same principals who owned the land developer's original entity shall not be considered a conveyance to a third party. For purposes of this subsection, the amount of the exemp- tion shall be the difference between the market value of the land with site improvements and the market value of the land without site improvements as shall be determined by a comparative market analysis of a similarly situated parcel or parcels of real property that have not been improved with such site improvements contemplated by this subsection. In the case the market value of land without site improvements cannot be reasonably assessed because of the absence of comparable sales, an exemption value of seventy - five percent (75%) of the market value of land with site improvements shall be granted to that parcel . An application is required for the exemption provided in this subsection in the first year the exemption is claimed; in subsequent consec- utive years no new application is required. The application must be made to the board of county commissioners by April 15 and the taxpayer and county as- sessor must be notified of any decision and assessment of property by May 15. The decision or assessment of property, or both, of the board of county com- missioners may be appealed to the county board of equalization no later than the fourth Monday in June. The applicant shall notify the board of county commissioners in writing of any change in eligibility for the parcel by April 15 . SECTION 2.

Reports of evaluation shall be provided to persons having full or partial legal or physical custody of a child. Failure of the department to evaluate a person or to reevaluate him within six (6) months of a previous examination shall not of itself enti- tle the person to a change in disposition but shall entitle him, his parent, guardian or custodian or his counsel to petition the court pursuant to sec- tion 16 - 1622, Idaho Code. (5) In a consultive capacity, the department shall assist communities in the development of constructive programs for the protection, prevention and care of children and youth.

(7) The department shall establish appropriate administrative proce- dures for the processing of complaints of child neglect, abuse and abandon- ment received and for the implementation of the protection, treatment and care of children formally or informally placed in the custody of the depart- ment or under its protective supervision under this chapter including, but not limited to: (a) Department employees whose job duties are related to the child pro- tective services system under this chapter shall first be trained as to their obligations under this chapter regarding the protection of chil- dren whose health and safety may be endangered. The curriculum shall include information regarding their legal duties, how to conduct their work in conformity with the requirements of this chapter, information regarding applicable federal and state laws with regard to the rights of the child, parent and others who may be under investigation under the child protective services system, and the applicable legal and consti- tutional parameters within which they are to conduct their work.

Provided however, that the court shall retain jurisdiction over the child, which jurisdiction shall be entered on any order or petition granting legal custody to the department, and the court shall have jurisdiction over all matters relating to the child. The department shall not place the child in the home from which the court ordered the child removed without first obtain- ing the approval of the court. (9) The department shall give to the court any information concerning the child that the court may at any time require, but in any event shall re- port the progress of the child under its custody or under its protective su- pervision at intervals of not to exceed six (6) months. The department shall file with the court at least five (5) days prior to the permanency hearing ei- 756 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 287 2013 ther under section 16 - 1622, Idaho Code, or, in the case of a finding of aggra- vated circumstances, section 16 - 1620, Idaho Code, the permanency plan and recommendations of the department. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that if a child is placed in the custody of the department and was also placed in out of the home care for a period not less than fifteen (15) out of the last twenty - two (22) months from the date the child entered shelter care, the de- partment shall initiate a petition for termination of parental rights. This presumption may be rebutted by a finding of the court that the filing of a petition for termination of parental rights would not be in the best inter- est of the child or reasonable efforts have not been provided to reunite the child with his family, or the child is placed permanently with a relative. (10) The department shall establish appropriate administrative proce- dures for the conduct of administrative reviews and hearings as required by federal statute for all children committed to the department and placed in out of the home care.

(3) Any such application shall be accompanied by a certificate of a des- ignated examiner stating that he has personally examined the proposed pa- tient within the last fourteen (14) days and is of the opinion that the pro- posed patient is: (i) mentally ill; (ii) likely to injure himself or oth- ers or is gravely disabled due to mental illness; and (iii) lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment, or a written statement by the ap- plicant that the proposed patient has refused to submit to examination by a designated examiner. (4) Upon receipt of an application for commitment, the court shall, within forty - eight (48) hours , appoint another designated examiner to make a personal examination of the proposed patient or if the proposed patient has not been examined, the court shall appoint two (2) designated examiners to make individual personal examinations of the proposed patient and may order the proposed patient to submit to an immediate examination. If neither designated examiner is a physician, the court shall order a physical examination of the proposed patient. At least one (1) designated examiner shall be a psychiatrist, licensed physician or licensed psychologist. The designated examiners shall report to the court their findings within the following seventy - two (72) hours as to the mental condition of the proposed patient and his need for custody, care, or treatment by a facility. The reports shall be in the form of written certificates which shall be filed with the court. The court may terminate the proceedings and dismiss the application without taking any further action in the event the reports of the designated examiners are to the effect that the proposed patient is not mentally ill or, although mentally ill, is not likely to injure himself or others or is not gravely disabled due to mental illness. If the proceedings are terminated, the proposed patient shall be released immediately. (5) If the designated examiner's certificate states a belief that the proposed patient is mentally ill and either likely to injure himself or oth- ers or is gravely disabled due to mental illness, the judge of such court shall issue an order authorizing any health officer, peace officer, or di- rector of a facility to take the proposed patient to a facility in the com- munity in which the proposed patient is residing or to the nearest facility to await the hearing and for good cause may authorize treatment during such period subject to the provisions of section 66 - 346(a)(4), Idaho Code. Under no circumstances shall the proposed patient be detained in a nonmedical unit used for the detention of individuals charged with or convicted of penal of- fenses. (6) Upon receipt of such application and designated examiners' reports the court shall appoint a time and place for hearing not more than seven (7) days from the receipt of such designated examiners' reports and thereupon give written notice of such time and place of such hearing together with a copy of the application, designated examiner's certificates, and notice of the proposed patient's right to be represented by an attorney, or if indi- gent, to be represented by a court - appointed attorney, to the applicant, to the proposed patient, to the proposed patient's spouse, guardian, next of 774 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 293 2013 kin or friend. With the consent of the proposed patient and his attorney, the hearing may be held immediately. Upon motion of the proposed patient and at- torney and for good cause shown, the court may continue the hearing up to an additional fourteen (14) days during which time, for good cause shown, the court may authorize treatment. (7) An opportunity to be represented by counsel shall be afforded to ev- ery proposed patient, and if neither the proposed patient nor others provide counsel, the court shall appoint counsel in accordance with chapter 8, ti- tle 19, Idaho Code, no later than the time the application is received by the court. (8) If the involuntary detention was commenced under this section, the hearing shall be held at a facility, at the home of the proposed patient, or at any other suitable place not likely to have a harmful effect on the pro- posed patient's physical or mental health. Venue for the hearing shall be in the county of residence of the proposed patient or in the county where the proposed patient was found immediately prior to commencement of such pro- ceedings. (9) In all proceedings under this section, any existing provision of the law prohibiting the disclosure of confidential communications between the designated examiner and proposed patient shall not apply and any desig- nated examiner who shall have examined the proposed patient shall be a compe- tent witness to testify as to the proposed patient's condition. (10) The proposed patient, the applicant, and any other persons to whom notice is required to be given shall be afforded an opportunity to appear at the hearing, to testify, and to present and cross - examine witnesses. The proposed patient shall be required to be present at the hearing unless the court determines that the mental or physical state of the proposed patient is such that his presence at the hearing would be detrimental to the proposed patient's health or would unduly disrupt the proceedings. A record of the proceedings shall be made as for other civil hearings. The hearing shall be conducted in as informal a manner as may be consistent with orderly proce- dure. The court shall receive all relevant and material evidence consistent with the rules of evidence. (11) If, upon completion of the hearing and consideration of the record, and after consideration of reasonable alternatives including, but not lim- ited to, holding the proceedings in abeyance for a period of up to thirty (30) days, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed pa- tient: (a) Is mentally ill; and (b) Is, because of such condition, likely to injure himself or others, or is gravely disabled due to mental illness; the court shall order the proposed patient committed to the custody of the department director for observation, care and treatment for an indetermi- nate period of time not to exceed one (1) year. The department director, through his dispositioner, shall determine within twenty - four (24) hours the least restrictive available facility or outpatient treatment, con- sistent with the needs of each patient committed under this section for observation, care, and treatment. (12) The commitment order constitutes a continuing authorization for the department of health and welfare, law enforcement, or director of a fa- cility, upon request of the director of the outpatient facility, the physi- cian, or the department director through his dispositioner, to transport a committed patient to designated outpatient treatment for the purpose of mak- ing reasonable efforts to obtain the committed patient's compliance with the terms and conditions of outpatient treatment. If the director of the outpa- tient facility, the treating physician, or the department director through his dispositioner determines any of the following: C. 293 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 775 (a) The patient is failing to adhere to the terms and conditions of outpatient treatment or the patient refuses outpatient treatment after reasonable efforts at compliance have been made; or (b) Outpatient treatment is not effective after reasonable efforts have been made; the department director through his dispositioner shall cause the committed patient to be transported by the department of health and welfare, law enforcement, or director of a facility to the least restrictive available facility for observation, care and treatment on an inpatient basis. Within forty - eight (48) hours of a committed patient's transfer from outpatient treatment to a facility for inpatient treatment, the department director through his dispositioner shall notify the court that originally ordered the commitment, the committed patient's attorney, and either the committed patient's spouse, guardian, adult next of kin or friend of the change in disposition and provide a detailed affidavit reciting the facts and cir- cumstances supporting the transfer from outpatient treatment to inpatient treatment at a facility. The court shall conduct an ex parte review of the notice and affidavit within forty - eight (48) hours of filing and determine whether the change in disposition from outpatient treatment to inpatient treatment at a facility is supported by probable cause. In no event shall the calculation of forty - eight (48) hours provided for in this subsection include holidays formally recognized and observed by the state of Idaho, nor shall the calculation include weekends. If the court determines that probable cause exists, the department director through his dispositioner shall continue with care and treatment on an inpatient basis at the least restrictive available facility. Within twenty - four (24) hours of a finding of probable cause, the court shall issue an order to show cause why the patient does not meet the conditions in subsection (12)(a) or (12)(b) of this section. The order shall be served on the committed patient, the committed patient's attorney and either the committed patient's spouse, guardian, adult next of kin or friend. The patient shall have fifteen (15) days to present evidence that the conditions in subsection (12)(a) or (12)(b) of this section have not been met. In no event shall the calcu- lation of twenty - four (24) hours provided for in this subsection include holidays formally recognized and observed by the state of Idaho, nor shall the calculation include weekends. If the court determines that a change in disposition from outpatient treatment to inpatient treatment does not meet the conditions in subsection (12)(a) or (12)(b) of this section, the department director through his dispositioner will continue with outpatient treatment on the same or modified terms and conditions. Nothing provided in this section shall limit the authority of any law enforcement officer to detain a patient pursuant to the emergency authority conferred by section 66 - 326, Idaho Code. (13) Nothing in this chapter or in any rule adopted pursuant thereto shall be construed to authorize the detention or involuntary admission to a hospital or other facility of an individual who: (a) Has epilepsy, a developmental disability, a physical disability, an intellectual disability, is impaired by chronic alcoholism or drug abuse, or aged, unless in addition to such condition, such person is mentally ill; (b) Is a patient under treatment by spiritual means alone, through prayer, in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination by a duly accredited practitioner thereof and who asserts to any authority attempting to detain him that he is under such treatment and who gives the name of a practitioner so treating him to such authority; or (c) Can be properly cared for privately with the help of willing and able family or friends, and provided, that such person may be detained or involuntarily admitted if such person is mentally ill and presents a 776 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 294 2013 substantial risk of injury to himself or others if allowed to remain at liberty. (14) The order of commitment shall state whether the proposed patient lacks capacity to make informed decisions about treatment, the name and ad- dress of the patient's attorney and either the patient's spouse, guardian, adult next of kin, or friend. (15) If the patient has no spouse or guardian and if the patient has property which may not be cared for pursuant to chapter 5, title 66, Idaho Code, or by the patient while confined at a facility, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the purpose of preserving the patient's estate, pending further guardianship or conservatorship proceedings. (16) The commitment shall continue until the commitment is terminated and shall be unaffected by the patient's conditional release or change in disposition. Approved April 9, 2013. CHAPTER 294 (H.B. No. 295) AN ACT RELATING TO THE EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAM; AMENDING SECTION 33 - 1002, IDAHO CODE, TO REVISE PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE DETERMINATION OF CERTAIN DISTRICT SUPPORT UNITS AND TO REVISE PROVISIONS RELATING TO A DISTRICT'S TOTAL ALLOWANCE FOR THE EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAM; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY. Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho: SECTION 1. That Section 33 - 1002, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 1002. EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAM. The educational support pro- gram is calculated as follows: (1) State Educational Support Funds. Add the state appropriation, in- cluding the moneys available in the public school income fund, together with all miscellaneous revenues to determine the total state funds. (2) From the total state funds subtract the following amounts needed for state support of special programs provided by a school district: (a) Pupil tuition - equivalency allowances as provided in section 33 - 1002B, Idaho Code; (b) Transportation support program as provided in section 33 - 1006, Idaho Code; (c) Feasibility studies allowance as provided in section 33 - 1007A, Idaho Code; (d) The approved costs for border district allowance, provided in sec- tion 33 - 1403, Idaho Code, as determined by the state superintendent of public instruction; (e) The approved costs for exceptional child approved contract al- lowance, provided in subsection 2. of section 33 - 2004, Idaho Code, as determined by the state superintendent of public instruction; (f) Certain expectant and delivered mothers allowance as provided in section 33 - 2006, Idaho Code; (g) Salary - based apportionment calculated as provided in sections 33 - 1004 through 33 - 1004F, Idaho Code; (h) Unemployment insurance benefit payments according to the provi- sions of section 72 - 1349A, Idaho Code; C. 294 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 777 (i) For expenditure as provided by the public school technology pro- gram; (j) For employee severance payments as provided in section 33 - 521, Idaho Code; (k) For distributions to the Idaho digital learning academy as provided in section 33 - 1020, Idaho Code; (l) For the support of provisions that provide a safe environment con- ducive to student learning and maintain classroom discipline, an allo- cation of $300 per support unit; and (m) Any additional amounts as required by statute to effect administra- tive adjustments or as specifically required by the provisions of any bill of appropriation; to secure the total educational support distribution funds. (3) Average Daily Attendance. The total state average daily attendance shall be the sum of the average daily attendance of all of the school dis- tricts of the state. The state board of education shall establish rules set- ting forth the procedure to determine average daily attendance and the time for, and method of, submission of such report. Average daily attendance cal- culation shall be carried out to the nearest hundredth. Computation of av- erage daily attendance shall also be governed by the provisions of section 33 - 1003A, Idaho Code. (4) Support Units. The total state support units shall be determined by using the tables set out hereafter called computation of kindergarten support units, computation of elementary support units, computation of secondary support units, computation of exceptional education support units, and computation of alternative school secondary support units. The sum of all of the total support units of all school districts of the state shall be the total state support units.

In applying the kindergarten table to a kindergarten program of less days than a full school year, the support unit allowance shall be in ratio to the number of days of a full school year. The tables for exceptional edu- cation and alternative school secondary support units shall be applicable only for programs approved by the state department of education following rules established by the state board of education. Moneys generated from computation of support units for alternative schools shall be utilized for alternative school programs. School district administrative and facility costs may be included as part of the alternative school expenditures. (5) State Distribution Factor per Support Unit. Divide educational support program distribution funds, after subtracting the amounts necessary C. 294 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 779 to pay the obligations specified in subsection (2) of this section, by the total state support units to secure the state distribution factor per support unit. (6) District Support Units. The number of support units for each school district in the state shall be determined as follows: (a) (i) Divide the actual average daily attendance, excluding stu- dents approved for inclusion in the exceptional child educational program, for the administrative schools and each of the separate schools and attendance units by the appropriate divisor from the tables of support units in this section, then add the quotients to obtain the district's support units allowance for regular stu- dents, kindergarten through grade 12 including alternative school secondary students. Calculations in application of this subsec- tion shall be carried out to the nearest tenth hundredth . (ii) Divide the combined totals of the average daily attendance of all preschool, kindergarten, elementary, secondary, juvenile detention center students and students with disabilities approved for inclusion in the exceptional child program of the district by the appropriate divisor from the table for computation of exceptional education support units to obtain the number of sup- port units allowed for the district's approved exceptional child program. Calculations for this subsection shall be carried out to the nearest tenth hundredth when more than one (1) unit is allowed. (iii) The total number of support units of the district shall be the sum of the total support units for regular students, subsec- tion (6)(a)(i) of this section, and the support units allowance for the approved exceptional child program, subsection (6)(a)(ii) of this section. (b) Total District Allowance Educational Program. Multiply the dis- trict's total number of support units, carried out to the nearest tenth hundredth , by the state distribution factor per support unit and to this product add the approved amount of programs of the district provided in subsection (2) of this section to secure the district's total allowance for the educational support program. (c) District Share. The district's share of state apportionment is the amount of the total district allowance, subsection (6)(b) of this sec- tion. (d) Adjustment of District Share. The contract salary of every noncer- tificated teacher shall be subtracted from the district's share as cal- culated from the provisions of subsection (6)(c) of this section. (7) Property Tax Computation Ratio. In order to receive state funds pursuant to this section a charter district shall utilize a school mainte- nance and operation property tax computation ratio for the purpose of cal- culating its maintenance and operation levy, that is no greater than that which it utilized in tax year 1994, less four - tenths of one percent (.4%). As used herein, the term \"property tax computation ratio\" shall mean a ratio de- termined by dividing the district's certified property tax maintenance and operation budget by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment pur- poses as such values existed on December 31, 1993. Such maintenance and op- eration levy shall be based on the property tax computation ratio multiplied by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes as such values existed on December 31 of the prior calendar year. SECTION 2. An emergency existing therefor, which emergency is hereby declared to exist, this act shall be in full force and effect on and after its passage and approval.

The Joint Finance - Appropriations Committee will be notified promptly of any increased positions so authorized. SECTION 4. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. The Legislature finds that investing in state employee compensation should remain a high priority even in tough economic times, and therefore strongly encourages agency directors, insti- tution executives and the Division of Financial Management to approve the use of salary savings to provide either one - time or ongoing merit increases for deserving employees, and also target employees who are below policy com- pensation. Such salary savings could result from turnover and attrition, or be the result of innovation and reorganization efforts that create savings. Such savings should be reinvested in employees. Agencies are cautioned to use one - time funding for one - time payments and ongoing funding for permanent pay increases. SECTION 5. There is hereby appropriated and the State Controller shall transfer $1,368,750 from the Permanent Building Fund to the Administration and Accounting Services Fund on July 1, 2013, or as soon thereafter as prac- ticable, and on January 1, 2014, or as soon thereafter as practicable, an amount of $1,368,750 for a total transfer of $2,737,500 for the Public Offi- cials' Capitol Mall Facilities payment due in fiscal year 2014.

The Permanent Building Fund Advisory Council is hereby authorized and directed to antici- pate revenues accruing to the Permanent Building Fund for the purpose of un- dertaking the construction, renovation, repair and acquisitions herein au- thorized, without delay, and to determine the priority of construction pur- suant to which the work hereunder will be undertaken. 784 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 297 2013 MAINTENANCE PROJECTS IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: Alterations and Repairs $14,000,000 Asbestos Abatement 114,100 Statewide American Disability Act Compliance 800,000 Capitol Mall Maintenance 120,000 Deferred Maintenance - Higher Education 12,500,000 TOTAL $27,534,100 CAPITAL PROJECTS: Capitol Annex Infrastructure $1,500,000 Idaho State University Anatomy Lab 1,957,300 University of Idaho Research & Innovation Center 2,500,000 Idaho State Historical Society Museum Remodel 2,400,000 Rexburg Military Readiness Center Remodel 722,500 TOTAL $9,079,800 GRAND TOTAL $36,613,900 SECTION 3. UTILIZATION OF MATCHING FUNDS. It is legislative intent that the moneys appropriated in this act may be made available for matching any allocation of moneys now in existence or hereafter made available by agen- cies of the United States and/or private donations; and it is further the ex- press intention of the Legislature to authorize the Division of Public Works to expend, for the purpose of paying the cost of any land, building, equip- ment or the rebuilding, renovation or repair of buildings, moneys appropri- ated for public works to various agencies as part of the respective agencies' operating budgets; provided the express approval by the Permanent Building Fund Advisory Council is granted to make application for such moneys in each instance. SECTION 4. EXEMPTION OF APPROPRIATIONS FROM CERTAIN PROVISIONS. All appropriations made herein shall be exempt from the provisions of Chapter 36, Title 67, and Section 67 - 3516, Idaho Code, but shall be available for expenditure only after allotment in accordance with the other provisions of Chapter 35, Title 67, Idaho Code, and all appropriations made hereunder shall be subject to the provisions of Section 67 - 5711, Idaho Code, except as otherwise provided herein. SECTION 5. REALLOCATION OF PROJECT SAVINGS. It is the intent of the Leg- islature that the Division of Public Works have the flexibility to allocate any savings or unused appropriation from any capital, line - item project to any other requested and funded fiscal year 2014 capital projects. The re- allocation of such appropriation must be approved by the Permanent Building Fund Advisory Council prior to the funds being spent. SECTION 6. FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE ON THE NEED FOR DEFERRED MAINTE- NANCE FUNDING AT THE STATE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING. It is the find- ing of the Legislature that the campuses of our state institutions, the Uni- versity of Idaho, Boise State University, Idaho State University and Lewis - Clark State College have significant deferred maintenance needs that cannot be met with the existing revenue available in the Permanent Building Fund. A study was prepared by the Legislative Services Office, at the request of C. 298 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 785 the Joint Finance - Appropriations Committee, to define and quantify the de- ferred maintenance needs of the institutions. Working jointly with the in- stitutions and the Office of the State Board of Education, it was determined that each institution's annual maintenance and repair needs greatly exceed available funding from state or institution resources. Therefore, the Leg- islature recognizes that there is an opportunity to designate one - time funds generated by excess cigarette taxes deposited into the Permanent Building Fund for the Capitol restoration that will not be necessary in fiscal year 2014 to make the bond payment, and that can be used to enhance the safety of and extend the usefulness of the buildings on the respective campuses. It is the intent of the Legislature that these funds shall not supplant any fund- ing requested and approved for the universities and college by the Division of Public Works for alterations and repairs in Section 2 of this act. The Di- vision of Public Works is authorized to work jointly with the State Board of Education to identify suitable projects for which funds have not been previ- ously appropriated through occupancy costs. SECTION 7. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AT THE STATE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 63 - 2520, Idaho Code, of the total amount of moneys distributed to the Permanent Building Fund for the Capitol restoration, $12,500,000 shall be designated to meet the deferred maintenance needs of the four - year public institutions of higher learning in the State of Idaho. Of the amount available, the University of Idaho shall receive $3,750,000; Boise State University shall receive $3,750,000; Idaho State University shall receive $3,750,000; and Lewis - Clark State College shall receive $1,250,000.

(2) There shall be three (3) categories of annual contracts available to local school districts under which to employ certificated personnel: (a) A category 1 contract is a limited one - year contract as provided in section 33 - 514A, Idaho Code. (b) A category 2 contract is for certificated personnel in the first and second years of continuous employment with the same school district. Upon the decision by a local school board not to reemploy the person for the following year, the certificated employee shall be provided a written statement of reasons for non - reemployment by no later than May 25. No property rights shall attach to a category 2 contract and therefore the employee shall not be entitled to a review by the local board of the reasons or decision not to reemploy. (c) A category 3 contract is for certificated personnel during the third year of continuous employment by the same school district. District procedures shall require at least one (1) evaluation prior to the beginning of the second semester of the school year and the results of any such evaluation shall be made a matter of record in the employee's 788 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 298 2013 personnel file. When any such employee's work is found to be unsatis- factory a defined period of probation shall be established by the board, but in no case shall a probationary period be less than eight (8) weeks. After the probationary period, action shall be taken by the board as to whether the employee is to be retained, immediately discharged, discharged upon termination of the current contract or reemployed at the end of the contract term under a continued probationary status. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 67 - 2344 and 67 - 2345, Idaho Code, a decision to place certificated personnel on probationary status may be made in executive session and the employee shall not be named in the minutes of the meeting. A record of the decision shall be placed in the employee's personnel file. This procedure shall not preclude recognition of unsatisfactory work at a subsequent evaluation and the establishment of a reasonable period of probation. In all instances, the employee shall be duly notified in writing of the areas of work which are deficient, including the conditions of probation. Each such certificated employee on a category 3 contract shall be given notice, in writing, whether he or she will be reemployed for the next ensuing year. Such notice shall be given by the board of trustees no later than the twenty - fifth day of May of each such year. If the board of trustees has decided not to reemploy the certificated employee, then the notice must contain a statement of reasons for such decision and the employee shall, upon request, be given the opportunity for an informal review of such decision by the board of trustees. The parameters of an informal review shall be determined by the local board. (3) School districts hiring an employee who has been on renewable contract status with another Idaho district or has out - of - state experience which would otherwise qualify the certificated employee for renewable contract status in Idaho, shall have the option to immediately grant re- newable contract status, or to place the employee on a category 3 annual contract. Such employment on a category 3 contract under the provisions of this subsection may be for one (1), two (2) or three (3) years. (4) There shall be a minimum of two one ( 2 1 ) written evaluation s in each of the annual contract years of employment, and at least one (1) evaluation shall be completed before January 1 of each year. The provisions of this sub- section (4) shall not apply to employees on a category 1 contract which shall be completed no later than May 1 of each year. The evaluation shall include a minimum of two (2) documented observations, one (1) of which shall be com- pleted prior to January 1 of each year. The requirement to provide at least one (1) written evaluation does not exclude additional evaluations that may be performed. No civil action for money damages shall arise for failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection . SECTION 3. That Section 33 - 515, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 515. ISSUANCE OF RENEWABLE CONTRACTS. (1) During the third full year of continuous employment by the same school district, including any specially chartered district, each certificated employee named in subsec- tion (16) of section 33 - 1001, Idaho Code, and each school nurse and school librarian shall be evaluated for a renewable contract and shall, upon having been offered a contract for the next ensuing year, having given notice of acceptance of renewal and upon signing a contract for a fourth full year, be placed on a renewable contract status with said school district subject to the provisions included in this chapter. (2) After the third full year of employment and at least once annu- ally, the performance of each such certificated employee, school nurse, or school librarian shall be evaluated according to criteria and procedures established by the board of trustees in accordance with general guidelines C. 298 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 789 approved by the state board of education. Such an evaluation shall be completed no later than May 1 of each year. The evaluation shall include a minimum of two (2) documented observations, one (1) of which shall be completed prior to January 1 of each year. Except as otherwise provided, that person shall have the right to automatic renewal of contract by giving notice, in writing, of acceptance of renewal. Such notice shall be given to the board of trustees of the school district then employing such person not later than the first day of June preceding the expiration of the term of the current contract. Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, the board of trustees shall notify each person entitled to be employed on a renewable contract of the requirement that such person must give the notice hereinabove and that failure to do so may be interpreted by the board as a declination of the right to automatic renewal or the offer of another contract. Such notification shall be made, in writing, not later than the fifteenth day of May, in each year, except to those persons to whom the board, prior to said date, has sent proposed contracts for the next ensuing year, or to whom the board has given the notice required by this section. (3) Any contract automatically renewed under the provisions of this section shall be for the same length as the term stated in the current contract and at a salary no lower than that specified therein, to which shall be added such increments as may be determined by the statutory or regulatory rights of such employee by reason of training, service, or performance, except where a board of trustees has declared a financial emergency pursuant to section 33 - 522, Idaho Code. (4) Nothing in this section shall prevent the board of trustees from of- fering a renewed contract increasing the salary of any certificated person, or from reassigning an administrative employee to a nonadministrative posi- tion with appropriate reduction of salary from the preexisting salary level. In the event the board of trustees reassigns an administrative employee to a nonadministrative position, the board shall give written notice to the em- ployee which contains a statement of the reasons for the reassignment. The employee, upon written request to the board, shall be entitled to an informal review of that decision. The process and procedure for the informal review shall be determined by the local board of trustees. (5) Before a board of trustees can determine not to renew for reasons of an unsatisfactory report of the performance of any certificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, or to renew the contract of any such person at a reduced salary, such person shall be entitled to a reasonable period of probation. This period of probation shall be preceded by a written notice from the board of trustees with reasons for such proba- tionary period and with provisions for adequate supervision and evaluation of the person's performance during the probationary period. Such period of probation shall not affect the person's renewable contract status. Consid- eration of probationary status for certificated personnel is consideration of the status of an employee within the meaning of section 67 - 2345, Idaho Code, and may be held in executive session. If the consideration results in probationary status, the individual on probation shall not be named in the minutes of the meeting. A record of the decision shall be placed in the teacher's personnel file. (6) If the board of trustees takes action to immediately discharge or discharge upon termination of the current contract a certificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, or to renew the contract of any such person at a reduced salary, the action of the board shall be consistent with the procedures specified in section 33 - 513(5), Idaho Code, and furthermore, the board shall notify the employee in writing whether there is just and reasonable cause not to renew the contract or to reduce the salary of the affected employee, and if so, what reasons it relied upon in that determination. 790 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 298 2013 (7) If the board of trustees takes action after the declaration of a financial emergency pursuant to section 33 - 522, Idaho Code, and such action is directed at more than one (1) certificated employee and, if mutually agreed to by both parties, a single informal review shall be conducted. Without mutual consent of both parties, the board of trustees shall use the following procedure to conduct a single due process hearing within sixty - seven (67) days of the declaration of financial emergency pursuant to section 33 - 522(2), Idaho Code, or on or before June 22, whichever shall occur first: (a) The superintendent or any other duly authorized administrative of- ficer of the school district may recommend the change in the length of the term stated in the current contract or reduce the salary of any cer- tificated employee by filing with the board of trustees written notice specifying the purported reasons for such changes. (b) Upon receipt of such notice, the board of trustees, acting through its duly authorized administrative official, shall give the affected employees written notice of the reductions and the recommendation of the change in the length of the term stated in the current contract or the reduction of salary, along with written notice of a hearing before the board of trustees prior to any determination by the board of trustees. (c) The hearing shall be scheduled to take place not less than six (6) days nor more than fourteen (14) days after receipt of the notice by the employees. The date provided for the hearing may be changed by mutual consent. (d) The hearing shall be open to the public. (e) All testimony at the hearing shall be given under oath or affirma- tion. Any member of the board, or the clerk of the board of trustees, may administer oaths to witnesses or affirmations by witnesses. (f) The employees may be represented by legal counsel and/or by a repre- sentative of a local or state education association. (g) The chairman of the board of trustees or the designee of the chair- man shall conduct the hearing. (h) The board of trustees shall cause an electronic record of the hear- ing to be made or shall employ a competent reporter to take stenographic or stenotype notes of all the testimony at the hearing. A transcript of the hearing shall be provided at cost by the board of trustees upon re- quest of the employee. (i) At the hearing the superintendent or other duly authorized admin- istrative officer shall present evidence to substantiate the reduction contained in such notice. (j) The employees may produce evidence to refute the reduction. Any witness presented by the superintendent or by the employees shall be subject to cross - examination. The board of trustees may also examine witnesses and be represented by counsel. (k) The affected employees may file written briefs and arguments with the board of trustees within three (3) days after the close of the hear- ing or such other time as may be agreed upon by the affected employees and the board of trustees. (l) Within seven (7) days following the close of the hearing, the board of trustees shall determine and, acting through its duly authorized ad- ministrative official, shall notify the employees in writing whether the evidence presented at the hearing established the need for the ac- tion taken. The due process hearing pursuant to this subsection (7) shall not be required if the board of trustees and the local education association reach an agree- ment on issues agreed upon pursuant to section 33 - 522(3), Idaho Code. (8) If the board of trustees, for reasons other than unsatisfactory service, for the ensuing contract year, determines to change the length C. 299 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 791 of the term stated in the current contract, reduce the salary or not renew the contract of a certificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, nothing herein shall require a probationary period.

Waiver requirements. Local education agency administrative of- ficials shall waive specific courses required for graduation if similar coursework has been satisfactorily completed in another local education agency or shall provide reasonable justification for denial.

B. Exit exams. States shall accept: 1) exit or end - of - course exams re- quired for graduation from the sending state; or 2) national norm - referenced achievement tests; or 3) alternative testing, in lieu of testing require- ments for graduation in the receiving state.

C. Transfers during senior year. Should a military student transfer- ring at the beginning or during his or her senior year be ineligible to grad- uate from the receiving local education agency after all alternatives have been considered, the sending and receiving local education agencies shall ensure the receipt of a diploma from the sending local education agency, if the student meets the graduation requirements of the sending local education agency. In the event that one (1) of the states in question is not a member of this compact, the member state shall use best efforts to facilitate the on - time graduation of the student in accordance with sections A. and B. of this article.

Give public notice of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact. The interstate commission and its committees may close a meeting, or portion thereof, where it determines by two - thirds (2/3) vote that an open meeting would be likely to: 1. Relate solely to the interstate commission's internal personnel practices and procedures; 2. Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by federal and state statute; 3.

The interstate commission shall, by a majority of the members, elect annually from among its members a chairperson, a vice - chairperson, and a treasurer, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson or, in the chairperson's absence or disability, the vice - chairperson shall preside at all meetings of the inter- state commission. The officers so elected shall serve without compensation or remuneration from the interstate commission; provided that, subject to the availability of budgeted funds, the officers shall be reimbursed for or- dinary and necessary costs and expenses incurred by them in the performance of their responsibilities as officers of the interstate commission. C. Executive committee, officers and personnel. 1. The executive committee shall have such authority and duties as may be set forth in the bylaws including, but not limited to: a. Managing the affairs of the interstate commission in a manner consistent with the bylaws and purposes of the interstate commis- sion; b. Overseeing an organizational structure within, and appropri- ate procedures for, the interstate commission to provide for the creation of rules, operating procedures, and administrative and technical support functions; and c. Planning, implementing, and coordinating communications and activities with other state, federal and local government orga- nizations in order to advance the goals of the interstate commis- sion. 2. The executive committee may, subject to the approval of the in- terstate commission, appoint or retain an executive director for such period, upon such terms and conditions and for such compensation, as the interstate commission may deem appropriate. The executive director 802 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 301 2013 shall serve as secretary to the interstate commission, but shall not be a member of the interstate commission. The executive director shall hire and supervise such other persons as may be authorized by the interstate commission. D. The interstate commission's executive director and its employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person. 1. The liability of the interstate commission's executive director and employees or interstate commission representatives, acting within the scope of such person's employment or duties for acts, errors, or omis- sions occurring within such person's state, may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents. The interstate commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to pro- tect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or li- ability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person. 2. The interstate commission shall defend the executive director and its employees and, subject to the approval of the attorney general or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by an interstate commission representative, shall defend such interstate commission representative in any civil action seeking to impose lia- bility arising out of an actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employ- ment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person. 3.

ARTICLE XII RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION A. Rulemaking authority. The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the pur- poses of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the in- terstate commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this act, or the powers granted hereun- C. 301 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 803 der, then such an action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect. B. Rulemaking procedure. Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the model state administrative pro- cedure act of 1981, as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the interstate commission. C. Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule is promulgated, any per- son may file a petition for judicial review of the rule; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substan- tial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the interstate commission's authority. D. If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any com- pacting state. ARTICLE XIII OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION A. Oversight 1. The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's pur- poses and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law. 2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, re- sponsibilities or actions of the interstate commission. 3. The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the interstate commission, this compact or promulgated rules. B. Default, technical assistance, suspension and termination. If the interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall: 1. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default and any action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default. 2. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regard- ing the default. 3. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default. 4. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been 804 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 301 2013 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states. 5. The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the ef- fective date of suspension or termination, including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination. 6. The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state. 7. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate commis- sion by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees. C. Dispute resolution. 1. The interstate commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among member states and between member and nonmember states. 2. The interstate commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. D. Enforcement. 1. The interstate commission, in the reasonable exer- cise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this com- pact. 2. The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, ini- tiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal of- fices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees. 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the in- terstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profes- sion. ARTICLE XIV FINANCING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION A. The interstate commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activi- ties. B. The interstate commission may levy on and collect an annual assess- ment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and activ- ities of the interstate commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the interstate commission's annual budget as ap- proved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states. C. The interstate commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the inter- C. 301 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 805 state commission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and with the authority of the member state. D. The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all re- ceipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures estab- lished under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the interstate commission shall by audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the interstate commission. ARTICLE XV MEMBER STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT A. Any state is eligible to become a member state. B. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative en- actment of the compact into law by no less than ten (10) of the states. The effective date shall be no earlier than December 1, 2007. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other member state upon enact- ment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the activities of the interstate commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states. C. The interstate commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the member states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the member states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the member states. ARTICLE XVI WITHDRAWAL AND DISSOLUTION A. Withdrawal. 1. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every member state; provided that a member state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law. 2. Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until one (1) year after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the with- drawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other member jurisdiction. 3. The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legisla- tion repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty (60) days of its receipt thereof. 4. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obli- gations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal. 5. Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission. B. Dissolution of compact. 1. This compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the member state which reduces the membership in the compact to one (1) member state. 806 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 302 2013 2.

ARTICLE XVII SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION A. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provi- sions of the compact shall be enforceable. B. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to ef- fectuate its purposes. C. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prohibit the applica- bility of other interstate compacts to which the states are members. ARTICLE XVIII BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS A. Other laws. 1. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with this compact. 2. All member states' laws conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. B. Binding effect of the compact. 1. All lawful actions of the inter- state commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the inter- state commission, are binding upon the member states. 2.

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho: C. 302 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 807 SECTION 1. There is hereby appropriated to the Department of Health and Welfare, the following amounts to be expended according to the designated programs and expense classes, from the listed funds for the period July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014: FOR FOR FOR TRUSTEE AND PERSONNEL OPERATING BENEFIT COSTS EXPENDITURES PAYMENTS TOTAL I.

FTP AUTHORIZATION. In accordance with Section 67 - 3519, Idaho Code, each of the divisions in the Department of Health and Welfare listed below is authorized no more than the number of full - time equivalent positions listed below at any point during the period July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014, unless specifically authorized by the Governor. The Joint Finance - Appropriations Committee will be notified promptly of any increased positions so authorized. Service GENERAL FUND TRANSFERS. As appropriated, the State Con- troller shall make transfers from the General Fund to the Cooperative Welfare Fund, periodically, as requested by the director of the Department of Health and Welfare and approved by the Board of Examiners. SECTION 4. TRUSTEE AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS. Notwithstanding the pro- visions of Section 67 3511, Idaho Code, funds budgeted in the trustee and benefit payments expenditure class shall not be transferred to any other expense classes during fiscal year 2014. SECTION 5. PROGRAM INTEGRITY. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, it is hereby declared to be the intent of the Legislature that the De- partment of Health and Welfare shall be required to provide those services authorized or mandated by law in each program, only to the extent of funding and available resources appropriated for each budgeted program. SECTION 6. ACTUAL AND FORECAST DETAIL REPORTING. The Division of Wel- fare shall deliver the Self - Reliance Programs Forecast to the Legislative Services Office and Division of Financial Management no less than quarterly. The report shall include monthly caseload details for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Child Care, Medicaid, Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, Food Stamps, and Child Support programs. The Self - Reliance Pro- grams Forecast shall also include expenditure details for all of the named programs with the exception of Medicaid. The format of the report, and any additional information contained therein, shall be determined by the Leg- islative Services Office and Division of Financial Management. SECTION 7. MEDICAID READINESS. It is the intent of the Legislature that funding provided for the Medicaid Readiness project in fiscal year 2014 sup- port only the \"mandatory\" changes to the Medicaid program that are required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Funding for the Medicaid Readiness project should not be construed as acceptance nor rejection of the \"optional\" expansion of the Medicaid program as identified in the June 28, 2012, Supreme Court Ruling in the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services. SECTION 8. HEAD START APPROPRIATION FROM TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILY FUNDS. At a minimum, the Department of Health and Welfare is directed to maintain Head Start appropriations paid from federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds at the same level as was paid to the Head Start Program in fiscal year 2007. SECTION 9. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. The Legislature finds that investing in state employee compensation should remain a high priority even in tough economic times, and therefore strongly encourages agency directors, insti- tution executives and the Division of Financial Management to approve the use of salary savings to provide either one - time or ongoing merit increases for deserving employees, and also target employees who are below policy com- pensation. Such salary savings could result from turnover and attrition, or C. 303 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 809 be the result of innovation and reorganization efforts that create savings. Such savings should be reinvested in employees. Agencies are cautioned to use one - time funding for one - time payments and ongoing funding for permanent pay increases. SECTION 10. CLARIFYING GUIDANCE ON EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. Relating to the direction provided in Section 9 of this act, which encourages the use of \"salary savings\" for merit increases, reduced reliance on the General Fund for personnel costs resulting from changes in federal match rates are not considered \"salary savings,\" and should not be considered for use as such.

SECTION 6. MEDICAID TRACKING REPORT. The Department of Health and Welfare, Medical Assistance Services Division and Indirect Support Services Division, shall deliver on a monthly basis to the Legislative Services Office and the Division of Financial Management a report that compares the Medicaid budget as appropriated, distributed by month for the year, to actual expenditures and remaining forecasted expenditures for the year.

The for- mat of the report, and information contained therein, shall be determined by the Legislative Services Office and the Division of Financial Management. SECTION 11. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. The Legislature finds that invest- ing in state employee compensation should remain a high priority even in tough economic times, and therefore strongly encourages agency directors, institution executives and the Division of Financial Management to approve the use of salary savings to provide either one - time or ongoing merit increases for deserving employees, and also target employees who are below policy compensation. Such salary savings could result from turnover and attrition, or be the result of innovation and reorganization efforts that create savings. Such savings should be reinvested in employees. Agencies are cautioned to use one - time funding for one - time payments and ongoing funding for permanent pay increases. Approved April 9, 2013. CHAPTER 324 (S.B.

Each instructional and administrative staff position shall be assigned an appropriate multi- plier based upon the following table: C. 326 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 851 EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION MA MA + 12 MA + 24 MA + 36 Years BA BA + 12 BA + 24 BA + 36 BA + 48 BA + 60 ES/DR 2.01260 In determining the experience factor, the actual years of teaching or administrative service in a public school, in an accredited private or parochial school, or beginning in the 2005 - 06 school year and thereafter in an accredited college or university shall be credited , minus two (2); provided however, that the experience factor cannot be less than zero (0) . In determining the education factor, only credits earned after initial certification, based upon a transcript on file with the teacher certifica- tion office of the state department of education, earned at an institution of higher education accredited by the state board of education or a regional ac- crediting association, shall be allowed. Instructional staff whose initial certificate is an occupational specialist certificate shall be treated as BA degree prepared instructional staff. Credits earned by such occupational specialist instructional staff after initial certification shall be cred- ited toward the education factor. For the time period July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, instructional and administrative staff shall not advance on the education portion of the multiplier table. In determining the statewide average multiplier for instructional staff, no multiplier in excess of 1.59092 shall be used. If the actual statewide average multiplier for instructional staff, as determined by this section, exceeds 1.59092, then each school district's instructional staff multiplier shall be multiplied by the result of 1.59092 divided by the actual statewide average multiplier for instructional staff. In determining the statewide average multiplier for administrative staff, no multiplier in excess of 1.86643 shall be used. If the actual statewide average multiplier for administrative staff, as determined by this section, exceeds 1.86643, then each school district's administrative staff multiplier shall be multiplied by the result of 1.86643 divided by the actual statewide average multiplier for administrative staff. SECTION 12. That Section 33 - 1004E, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 852 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 326 2013 33 - 1004E. DISTRICT'S SALARY - BASED APPORTIONMENT. Each district shall be entitled to a salary - based apportionment calculated as provided in this section. 1. To determine the apportionment for instructional staff, first determine the district average experience and education index by placing all eligible district certificated instructional employees on the statewide index provided in section 33 - 1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting average is the district index. Districts with an index above the state average index shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .03 for the 1994 - 95 school year, and shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .06 for the 1995 - 96 school year, and thereafter shall receive their actual district index. The district instructional staff index shall be multiplied by the instructional base salary of $23,123. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for instructional staff determined as provided in section 33 - 1004(2), Idaho Code. The instructional salary allocation shall be further increased by the amount necessary for each full - time equivalent instructional staff member placed on the experience and education index to be allocated at least the minimum salary mandated by this section. Full - time instructional staff salaries shall be determined from a salary schedule developed by each district and submitted to the state department of education. No full - time instructional staff member shall be paid less than $ 30,500 31,000 . If an instructional staff member has been certified by the national board for professional teaching standards, the staff member shall be designated as a master teacher and receive $2,000 per year for five (5) years. The instructional salary shall be increased by $2,000 for each master teacher provided however, that no such awards shall be paid for the period July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, nor shall any liabilities accrue or payments be made pursuant to this section in the future to any individuals who would have otherwise qualified for a payment during this stated time period. The resulting amount is the district's salary - based apportionment for instructional staff. For purposes of this section, teachers qualifying for the salary increase as master teacher shall be those who have been recognized as national board certified teachers as of July 1 of each year. 2. To determine the apportionment for district administrative staff, first determine the district average experience and education index by placing all eligible certificated administrative employees on the statewide index provided in section 33 - 1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting average is the district index. Districts with an index above the state average index shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .03 for the school year 1994 - 95, and shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average index plus .06 for the 1995 - 96 school year, and thereafter shall receive their actual district index. The district adminis- trative staff index shall be multiplied by the base salary of $31,833. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for administrative staff determined as provided in section 33 - 1004(3), Idaho Code. The resulting amount is the district's salary - based apportionment for administrative staff. 3. To determine the apportionment for classified staff, multiply $19,058 by the district classified staff allowance determined as provided in section 33 - 1004(4), Idaho Code. The amount so determined is the district's apportionment for classified staff. 4. The district's salary - based apportionment shall be the sum of the apportionments calculated in subsections 1., 2. and 3., of this section, plus the benefit apportionment as provided in section 33 - 1004F, Idaho Code. SECTION 13. The Idaho Digital Learning Academy (IDLA), created pur- suant to Chapter 55, Title 33, Idaho Code, shall utilize state appropriated C. 326 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 853 funds for the period July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014, to achieve the following: (1) Tuition charged by IDLA to Idaho students shall not exceed $100 per enrollment.

(4) Pursuant to State Board of Education rule, IDAPA 08.02.03, Docket Number 08 - 0203 - 0605, work with institutions of higher education to provide dual credit coursework. The preceding list shall not be construed as excluding other instruction and training that may be provided by the Idaho Digital Learning Academy. SECTION 14. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, of the moneys appropriated in Section 5 of this act, up to $4,331,400 from funds determined by available tobacco, cigarette and lottery income tax revenues accruing, appropriated, or distributed to the Public School Income Fund pursuant to Sections 63 - 2506, 63 - 2552A, 63 - 3035A and 63 - 3067, Idaho Code, for the period July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014, shall be distributed as discretionary funds within the Public Schools Educational Support Program/Division of Operations, and school districts and charter schools are hereby relieved of any restrictions on the use of such funds, apart from restrictions that apply to the use of discretionary funds.

SECTION 18. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 33 - 1018, Idaho Code, for the period July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014, it is estimated that 854 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 326 2013 the appropriation of state funds to the Public Schools Educational Support Program/Division of Operations will result in total discretionary funds of $20,000 per support unit. SECTION 19. Of the moneys appropriated in Section 6 of this act, $10,500,000 shall be used for literacy programs, as outlined in Sections 33 - 1207A(2), 33 - 1614 and 33 - 1615, Idaho Code; remedial coursework for students failing to achieve proficiency in the Idaho Standards Achievement Test; computerized remediation services to schools; and math initiative efforts, in dollar amounts determined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. It is legislative intent that the State Board of Education and State Department of Education coordinate federally funded literacy programs with state literacy programs, resulting in well - coordinated, complementary literacy efforts.

(3) Average Daily Attendance. The total state average daily attendance shall be the sum of the average daily attendance of all of the school dis- tricts of the state. The state board of education shall establish rules set- ting forth the procedure to determine average daily attendance and the time for, and method of, submission of such report. Average daily attendance cal- culation shall be carried out to the nearest hundredth. Computation of av- erage daily attendance shall also be governed by the provisions of section 33 - 1003A, Idaho Code. (4) Support Units. The total state support units shall be determined by using the tables set out hereafter called computation of kindergarten support units, computation of elementary support units, computation of secondary support units, computation of exceptional education support units, and computation of alternative school secondary support units. The sum of all of the total support units of all school districts of the state shall be the total state support units.

In applying the kindergarten table to a kindergarten program of less days than a full school year, the support unit allowance shall be in ratio to the number of days of a full school year. The tables for exceptional edu- cation and alternative school secondary support units shall be applicable only for programs approved by the state department of education following rules established by the state board of education. Moneys generated from computation of support units for alternative schools shall be utilized for alternative school programs. School district administrative and facility costs may be included as part of the alternative school expenditures. (5) State Distribution Factor per Support Unit. Divide educational support program distribution funds, after subtracting the amounts necessary to pay the obligations specified in subsection (2) of this section, by the total state support units to secure the state distribution factor per support unit. (6) District Support Units. The number of support units for each school district in the state shall be determined as follows: (a) (i) Divide the actual average daily attendance, excluding stu- dents approved for inclusion in the exceptional child educational program, for the administrative schools and each of the separate schools and attendance units by the appropriate divisor from the tables of support units in this section, then add the quotients to obtain the district's support units allowance for regular stu- dents, kindergarten through grade 12 including alternative school secondary students. Calculations in application of this subsec- tion shall be carried out to the nearest tenth. (ii) Divide the combined totals of the average daily attendance of all preschool, kindergarten, elementary, secondary, juvenile detention center students and students with disabilities approved for inclusion in the exceptional child program of the district by the appropriate divisor from the table for computation of exceptional education support units to obtain the number of sup- port units allowed for the district's approved exceptional child program. Calculations for this subsection shall be carried out to the nearest tenth when more than one (1) unit is allowed. (iii) The total number of support units of the district shall be the sum of the total support units for regular students, subsec- C. 340 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 893 tion (6)(a)(i) of this section, and the support units allowance for the approved exceptional child program, subsection (6)(a)(ii) of this section. (b) Total District Allowance Educational Program. Multiply the dis- trict's total number of support units, carried out to the nearest tenth, by the state distribution factor per support unit and to this product add the approved amount of programs of the district provided in subsec- tion (2) of this section to secure the district's total allowance for the educational support program. (c) District Share. The district's share of state apportionment is the amount of the total district allowance, subsection (6)(b) of this sec- tion. (d) Adjustment of District Share. The contract salary of every noncer- tificated teacher shall be subtracted from the district's share as cal- culated from the provisions of subsection (6)(c) of this section. (7) Property Tax Computation Ratio. In order to receive state funds pursuant to this section a charter district shall utilize a school mainte- nance and operation property tax computation ratio for the purpose of cal- culating its maintenance and operation levy, that is no greater than that which it utilized in tax year 1994, less four - tenths of one percent (.4%). As used herein, the term \"property tax computation ratio\" shall mean a ratio de- termined by dividing the district's certified property tax maintenance and operation budget by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment pur- poses as such values existed on December 31, 1993. Such maintenance and op- eration levy shall be based on the property tax computation ratio multiplied by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes as such values existed on December 31 of the prior calendar year. SECTION 2. That Section 33 - 1004, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 1004. STAFF ALLOWANCE. For each school district, a staff allowance shall be determined as follows: (1) Using the daily attendance reports that have been submitted for computing the February 15 apportionment of state funds as provided in sec- tion 33 - 1009, Idaho Code, determine the total support units for the district in the manner provided in section 33 - 1002(6)(a), Idaho Code; (2) Determine the instructional staff allowance by multiplying the support units by 1.1. A district must demonstrate that it actually employs the number of certificated instructional staff allowed, except as provided in subsection (5)(f) , and (g) and (h) of this section. If the district does not employ the number allowed, the staff allowance shall be reduced to the actual number employed, except as provided in subsection (5)(f) , and (g) and (h) of this section; (3) Determine the administrative staff allowance by multiplying the support units by .075; (4) Determine the classified staff allowance by multiplying the sup- port units by .375; (5) Additional conditions governing staff allowance: (a) In determining the number of staff in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section, a district may contract separately for services to be rendered by nondistrict employees and such employees may be counted in the staff allowance. A \"nondistrict employee\" means a person for whom the school district does not pay the employer's obligations for employee benefits. When a district contracts for the services of a nondistrict employee, only the salary portion of the contract shall be allowable for computations. (b) If there are circumstances preventing eligible use of staff al- lowance to which a district is entitled as provided in subsections (2) 894 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 340 2013 and (3) of this section, an appeal may be filed with the state department of education outlining the reasons and proposed alternative use of these funds, and a waiver may be granted. (c) For any district with less than forty (40) support units: (i) The instructional staff allowance shall be calculated applying the actual number of support units. If the actual in- structional staff employed in the school year is greater than the instructional staff allowance, then the instructional staff allowance shall be increased by one - half (1/2) staff allowance; and (ii) The administrative staff allowance shall be calculated ap- plying the actual number of support units. If the actual adminis- trative staff employed in the school year is greater than the ad- ministrative staff allowance, then the administrative staff al- lowance shall be increased by one - half (1/2) staff allowance. (iii) Additionally, for any district with less than twenty (20) support units, the instructional staff allowance shall be calcu- lated applying the actual number of support units. If the number of instructional staff employed in the school year is greater than the instructional staff allowance, the staff allowance shall be increased as provided in sub paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection paragraph , and by an additional one - half (1/2) instructional staff allowance. (d) For any school district with one (1) or more separate secondary schools serving grades nine (9) through twelve (12), the instructional staff allowance shall be increased by two (2) additional instructional staff allowances for each such separate secondary school. (e) Only instructional, administrative and classified personnel compensated by the school district from the general maintenance and operation fund of the district shall be included in the calculation of staff allowance or in any other calculations based upon staff, in- cluding determination of the experience and education multiplier, the reporting requirements, or the district's salary - based apportionment calculation. No food service staff or transportation staff shall be included in the staff allowance. (f) A district may utilize up to five fifteen percent ( 1 5%) of the mon- eys associated with positions funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to pay another school district or public charter school for in- structional services or to defray the cost of providing virtual educa- tion coursework, including virtual dual credit coursework, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed. (g) For the period July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2011, only, a district may shift up to five percent (5%) of the positions funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to federal funds, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed. (h) A district may employ nine and one - half percent (9.5%) fewer posi- tions than funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed. (6) In the event that the staff allowance in any category is insuffi- cient to meet accreditation standards, a district may appeal to the state board of education, demonstrating the insufficiency, and the state board may grant a waiver authorizing sufficient additional staff to be included within the staff allowance to meet accreditation standards. Such a waiver shall be limited to one (1) year, but may be renewed upon showing of continuing justi- fication. SECTION 3. That Section 33 - 1004A, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: C. 340 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 895 33 - 1004A. EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION MULTIPLIER. Each instructional and administrative staff position shall be assigned an appropriate multi- plier based upon the following table: EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION MA MA + 12 MA + 24 MA + 36 Years BA BA + 12 BA + 24 BA + 36 BA + 48 BA + 60 ES/DR 2.01260 In determining the experience factor, the actual years of teaching or administrative service in a public school, in an accredited private or parochial school, or beginning in the 2005 - 06 school year and thereafter in an accredited college or university shall be credited, minus two (2); provided however, that the experience factor cannot be less than zero (0). In determining the education factor, only credits earned after initial certification, based upon a transcript on file with the teacher certifica- tion office of the state department of education, earned at an institution of higher education accredited by the state board of education or a regional ac- crediting association, shall be allowed. Instructional staff whose initial certificate is an occupational specialist certificate shall be treated as BA degree prepared instructional staff. Credits earned by such occupational specialist instructional staff after initial certification shall be cred- ited toward the education factor. For the time period July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, instructional and administrative staff shall not advance on the education portion of the multiplier table. In determining the statewide average multiplier for instructional staff, no multiplier in excess of 1.59092 shall be used. If the actual statewide average multiplier for instructional staff, as determined by this section, exceeds 1.59092, then each school district's instructional staff multiplier shall be multiplied by the result of 1.59092 divided by the actual statewide average multiplier for instructional staff. In determining the statewide average multiplier for administrative staff, no multiplier in excess of 1.86643 shall be used. If the actual statewide average multiplier for administrative staff, as determined by this section, exceeds 1.86643, then each school district's administrative staff multiplier shall be multiplied by the result of 1.86643 divided by the actual statewide average multiplier for administrative staff. 896 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 340 2013 SECTION 4. That Section 33 - 1004E, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 1004E. DISTRICT'S SALARY - BASED APPORTIONMENT. Each district shall be entitled to a salary - based apportionment calculated as provided in this section. 1. To determine the apportionment for instructional staff, first determine the district average experience and education index by placing all eligible district certificated instructional employees on the statewide index provided in section 33 - 1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting average is the district index. Districts with an index above the state average index shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .03 for the 1994 - 95 school year, and shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .06 for the 1995 - 96 school year, and thereafter shall receive their actual district index. The district instructional staff index shall be multiplied by the instructional base salary of $23,123. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for instructional staff determined as provided in section 33 - 1004(2), Idaho Code. The instructional salary allocation shall be further increased by the amount necessary for each full - time equivalent instructional staff member placed on the experience and education index to be allocated at least the minimum salary mandated by this section. Full - time instructional staff salaries shall be determined from a salary schedule developed by each district and submitted to the state department of education. No full - time instructional staff member shall be paid less than $30,500. If an instructional staff member has been certified by the national board for professional teaching standards, the staff member shall be designated as a master teacher and receive $2,000 per year for five (5) years. The instructional salary shall be increased by $2,000 for each master teacher provided however, that no such awards shall be paid for the period July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, nor shall any liabilities accrue or payments be made pursuant to this section in the future to any individuals who would have otherwise qualified for a payment during this stated time period. The resulting amount is the district's salary - based apportionment for instructional staff. For purposes of this section, teachers qualifying for the salary increase as master teacher shall be those who have been recognized as national board certified teachers as of July 1 of each year. 2. To determine the apportionment for district administrative staff, first determine the district average experience and education index by placing all eligible certificated administrative employees on the statewide index provided in section 33 - 1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting average is the district index. Districts with an index above the state average index shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .03 for the school year 1994 - 95, and shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average index plus .06 for the 1995 - 96 school year, and thereafter shall receive their actual district index. The district adminis- trative staff index shall be multiplied by the base salary of $31,833. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for administrative staff determined as provided in section 33 - 1004(3), Idaho Code. The resulting amount is the district's salary - based apportionment for administrative staff. 3. To determine the apportionment for classified staff, multiply $19,058 by the district classified staff allowance determined as provided in section 33 - 1004(4), Idaho Code. The amount so determined is the district's apportionment for classified staff. 4. The district's salary - based apportionment shall be the sum of the apportionments calculated in subsections 1., 2. and 3., of this section, adjusted by the following percentage: C. 340 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 897 Fiscal Year Percentage 2013 (1.67%) plus the benefit apportionment as provided in section 33 - 1004F, Idaho Code. SECTION 5. That Chapter 10, Title 33, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION , to be known and des- ignated as Section 33 - 1021, Idaho Code, and to read as follows: 33 - 1021. MATH AND SCIENCE REQUIREMENT. In order to meet state gradua- tion requirements regarding math and science courses, moneys shall be dis- tributed to school districts to defray the cost of providing additional math and science courses beginning in fiscal year 2012. Moneys so distributed shall be used to hire additional high school math and science teachers or to defray costs associated with providing math and science courses to high school students. Moneys shall be distributed to school districts from the moneys appropriated to the educational support program for each regular high school, not including alternative schools, based on the following criteria: (1) For each school with enrollment of 99 or less, distribute the equiv- alent of one and one - quarter (1.25) of a classified staff position. (2) For each school with enrollment of 100 to 159, distribute the equiv- alent of one - ninth (1/9) of a classified staff position. (3) For each school with enrollment of 160 to 319, distribute the equiv- alent of two - sevenths (2/7) of a classified staff position.

(3) Average Daily Attendance. The total state average daily attendance shall be the sum of the average daily attendance of all of the school dis- tricts of the state. The state board of education shall establish rules set- ting forth the procedure to determine average daily attendance and the time for, and method of, submission of such report. Average daily attendance cal- culation shall be carried out to the nearest hundredth. Computation of av- erage daily attendance shall also be governed by the provisions of section 33 - 1003A, Idaho Code. (4) Support Units. The total state support units shall be determined by using the tables set out hereafter called computation of kindergarten support units, computation of elementary support units, computation of secondary support units, computation of exceptional education support units, and computation of alternative school secondary support units. The sum of all of the total support units of all school districts of the state shall be the total state support units.

In applying the kindergarten table to a kindergarten program of less days than a full school year, the support unit allowance shall be in ratio to the number of days of a full school year. The tables for exceptional edu- cation and alternative school secondary support units shall be applicable only for programs approved by the state department of education following rules established by the state board of education. Moneys generated from computation of support units for alternative schools shall be utilized for alternative school programs. School district administrative and facility costs may be included as part of the alternative school expenditures. (5) State Distribution Factor per Support Unit. Divide educational support program distribution funds, after subtracting the amounts necessary to pay the obligations specified in subsection (2) of this section, by the total state support units to secure the state distribution factor per support unit. (6) District Support Units. The number of support units for each school district in the state shall be determined as follows: (a) (i) Divide the actual average daily attendance, excluding stu- dents approved for inclusion in the exceptional child educational C. 342 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 903 program, for the administrative schools and each of the separate schools and attendance units by the appropriate divisor from the tables of support units in this section, then add the quotients to obtain the district's support units allowance for regular stu- dents, kindergarten through grade 12 including alternative school secondary students. Calculations in application of this subsec- tion shall be carried out to the nearest tenth. (ii) Divide the combined totals of the average daily attendance of all preschool, kindergarten, elementary, secondary, juvenile detention center students and students with disabilities approved for inclusion in the exceptional child program of the district by the appropriate divisor from the table for computation of exceptional education support units to obtain the number of sup- port units allowed for the district's approved exceptional child program. Calculations for this subsection shall be carried out to the nearest tenth when more than one (1) unit is allowed. (iii) The total number of support units of the district shall be the sum of the total support units for regular students, subsec- tion (6)(a)(i) of this section, and the support units allowance for the approved exceptional child program, subsection (6)(a)(ii) of this section. (b) Total District Allowance Educational Program. Multiply the dis- trict's total number of support units, carried out to the nearest tenth, by the state distribution factor per support unit and to this product add the approved amount of programs of the district provided in subsec- tion (2) of this section to secure the district's total allowance for the educational support program. (c) District Share. The district's share of state apportionment is the amount of the total district allowance, subsection (6)(b) of this sec- tion. (d) Adjustment of District Share. The contract salary of every noncer- tificated teacher shall be subtracted from the district's share as cal- culated from the provisions of subsection (6)(c) of this section. (7) Property Tax Computation Ratio. In order to receive state funds pursuant to this section a charter district shall utilize a school mainte- nance and operation property tax computation ratio for the purpose of cal- culating its maintenance and operation levy, that is no greater than that which it utilized in tax year 1994, less four - tenths of one percent (.4%). As used herein, the term \"property tax computation ratio\" shall mean a ratio de- termined by dividing the district's certified property tax maintenance and operation budget by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment pur- poses as such values existed on December 31, 1993. Such maintenance and op- eration levy shall be based on the property tax computation ratio multiplied by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes as such values existed on December 31 of the prior calendar year. SECTION 2. That Section 33 - 5208, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 5208. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL FINANCIAL SUPPORT. Except as provided in subsection ( 8 10 ) of this section, from the state educational support pro- gram the state department of education shall make the following apportion- ment to each public charter school for each fiscal year based on attendance figures submitted in a manner and time as required by the department of edu- cation: (1) Per student support. Computation of support units for each public charter school shall be calculated as if it were a separate school accord- ing to the schedules in section 33 - 1002(4), Idaho Code, except that public charter schools with fewer than one hundred (100) secondary ADA shall use a 904 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 342 2013 divisor of twelve (12) and the minimum units shall not apply, and no public charter school shall receive an increase in support units that exceeds the support units it received in the prior year by more than thirty (30). Funding from the state educational support program shall be equal to the total dis- tribution factor, plus the salary - based apportionment provided in chapter 10, title 33, Idaho Code. Provided however, any public charter school that is formed by the conversion of an existing traditional public school shall be assigned divisors, pursuant to section 33 - 1002, Idaho Code, that are no lower than the divisors of the school district in which the traditional pub- lic school is located, for each category of pupils listed. (2) Special education. For each student enrolled in the public charter school who is entitled to special education services, the state and federal funds from the exceptional child education program for that student that would have been apportioned for that student to the school district in which the public charter school is located. (3) Alternative school support. Public charter schools may qualify un- der the provisions of sections 33 - 1002 and 33 - 1002C, Idaho Code, provided the public charter school meets the necessary statutory requirements, and students qualify for attendance at an alternative school as provided by rule of the state board of education. (4) Transportation support. Support shall be paid to the public charter school as provided in chapter 15, title 33, Idaho Code, and sec- tion 33 - 1006, Idaho Code. Each public charter school shall furnish the department with an enrollment count as of the first Friday in November, of public charter school students who are eligible for reimbursement of trans- portation costs under the provisions of this subsection and who reside more than one and one - half (1 1/2) miles from the school. The state department of education is authorized to include in the annual appropriation to the charter school sixty percent (60%) of the estimated transportation cost. The final appropriation payment in July shall reflect reimbursements of actual costs pursuant to section 33 - 1006, Idaho Code. To be eligible for state reimbursement under the provisions of section 33 - 1006, Idaho Code, the student to be transported must reside within the public charter school's primary attendance area, and must meet at least one (1) of the following two (2) criteria: (a) The student resides within the school district in which the public charter school is physically located; or (b) The student resides within fifteen (15) miles of the public charter school, by road. The limitations placed by this subsection on the reimbursement of transportation costs for certain students shall not apply to public virtual schools. (5) Facilities funds. The state department of education shall distrib- ute facilities funds to public charter schools for each enrolled student in which a majority of the student's instruction is received at a facility that is owned or leased by the public charter school. Such funds shall be used to defray the purchase, fee, loan or lease costs associated with payments for real property used by the students or employees of the public charter school for educational or administrative purposes. Such funds shall be distributed from the moneys appropriated to the educational support program, and shall be calculated as a percentage of the statewide average amount of bond and plant facility funds levied per student by Idaho school districts, as fol- lows: Fiscal Year 2014 Twenty Percent (20%) Fiscal Year 2015 Thirty Percent (30%) For fiscal year 2016 and each fiscal year thereafter, this percentage shall increase by ten percent (10%) each time the total appropriation of C. 342 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 905 state funds for the educational support program increases by three percent (3%) or more over the prior fiscal year, and shall decrease by ten percent (10%) each time the total appropriation of state funds for the educational support program decreases as compared to the prior fiscal year. Provided however, that the percentage shall be no less than twenty percent (20%) and no greater than fifty percent (50%), and that the average amount of funding received per public charter school shall not exceed the average amount of funding received by each school district pursuant to the provisions of section 33 - 906, Idaho Code. For those public charter schools that do not receive facilities funds for all enrolled students, the school may submit to the state department of education a reimbursement claim for any costs for which facilities funds may be used. The state department of education shall reduce such claim by the greater of fifty percent (50%) or the percentage of the school's enrolled students for which the school receives facilities funds, and shall pay the balance. Provided however, that the total reimbursements paid to a public charter school, in combination with any facilities stipend received by the school, shall not exceed the amount of facilities funds that would have been received by the school had the school received facilities funds for all en- rolled students. For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"real prop- erty\" shall be used as defined in section 63 - 201, Idaho Code. (6) Payment schedule. The state department of education is authorized to make an advance payment of twenty - five percent (25%) of a public charter school's estimated annual apportionment for its first year of operation, and each year thereafter, provided the public charter school has an increase of student population in any given year of twenty (20) students or more, to as- sist the school with initial start - up costs or payroll obligations. (a) For a public charter school to receive the advance payment, the school shall submit its anticipated fall membership for each grade level to the state department of education by June 1. (b) Using the figures provided by the public charter school, the state department of education shall determine an estimated annual apportion- ment from which the amount of the advance payment shall be calculated. Advance payment shall be made to the school on or after July 1 but no later than July 31. (c) All subsequent payments, taking into account the one - time advance payment made for the first year of operation, shall be made to the public charter school in the same manner as other traditional public schools in accordance with the provisions of section 33 - 1009, Idaho Code. A public charter school shall comply with all applicable fiscal requirements of law, except that the following provisions shall not be applicable to pub- lic charter schools: that portion of section 33 - 1004, Idaho Code, relating to reduction of the administrative and instructional staff allowance when there is a discrepancy between the number allowed and the number actually em- ployed; and section 33 - 1004E, Idaho Code, for calculation of district staff indices. ( 6 7 ) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit any private person or organization from providing funding or other financial assistance to the establishment or operation of a public charter school. (8) Each public charter school shall pay an authorizer fee to its autho- rized chartering entity, to defray the actual documented cost of monitoring, evaluation and oversight, which, in the case of public charter schools authorized by the public charter school commission, shall include each school's proportional fee share of all moneys appropriated to the public charter school commission, plus fifteen percent (15%). Provided however, that each public charter school's board of directors may direct up to ten percent (10%) of the calculated fee to pay membership fees to an organization or association that provides technical assistance, training and advocacy for Idaho public charter schools. Unless the authorized chartering entity 906 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 342 2013 declines payment, such fee shall be paid by February 15 of each fiscal year and shall not exceed the greater of: (a) All state funds distributed to public schools on a support unit ba- sis for the prior fiscal year, divided by the statewide number of public school students in average daily attendance in the first reporting pe- riod in the prior fiscal year; or (b) The lesser of: (i) The result of the calculation in subsection (8)(a) of this section, multiplied by four (4); or (ii) One and one - half percent (1.5%) of the result of the calcula- tion in subsection (8)(a) of this section, multiplied by the pub- lic charter school's average daily attendance in the first report- ing period in the current fiscal year. ( 7 9 ) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a public charter school from applying for federal grant moneys. ( 8 10 ) (a) Each student in attendance at a public virtual school shall be funded based upon either the actual hours of attendance in the public virtual school on a flexible schedule, or the percentage of coursework completed, whichever is more advantageous to the school, up to the maxi- mum of one (1) full - time equivalent student. (b) All federal educational funds shall be administered and dis- tributed to public charter schools, including public virtual schools, that have been designated by the state board of education as a local education agency (LEA), as provided in section 33 - 5203(7), Idaho Code. ( 9 11 ) Nothing in this section prohibits separate face - to - face learning activities or services. (1 0 2 ) The provisions of section 33 - 1021, Idaho Code, shall apply to pub- lic charter schools provided for in this chapter. SECTION 3. That Chapter 52, Title 33, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION , to be known and des- ignated as Section 33 - 5214, Idaho Code, and to read as follows: 33 - 5214.

(16) A person twenty - one (21) years of age or older issued a license to carry a concealed weapon is exempt from any requirement to undergo a records check at the time of purchase or transfer of a firearm from a federally li- censed firearms dealer. However, a temporary emergency license issued un- der subsection (5) of this section shall not exempt the holder of the license from any records check requirement.

SECTION 3. That Section 39 - 3605, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 39 - 3605. IDENTIFICATION OF REFERENCE STREAMS OR CONDITIONS. The di- rector shall, in a manner consistent with the public participation provi- sions set forth in this chapter and in accordance with chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, consultation with the appropriate basin advisory group, iden- tify reference streams or conditions to assist in determining when whether the designated beneficial uses of water bodies within a basin are being fully supported. Streams or conditions shall be selected to represent the land types, land uses , hydrology, water uses and geophysical features of within the basins described in this chapter. Reference streams or conditions shall be representative of one (1) of the following: 946 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 348 2013 (1) A stream or other water body reflecting natural conditions with few impacts from human activities and which is representative of the highest level of support attainable in the basin; or (2) A stream or water body reflecting the minimum conditions necessary to fully support the designated beneficial uses of the stream or water body ; or (3) Physical, chemical and biological indicators identified in the rules of the department which reflect full support of designated beneficial uses. SECTION 4. That Section 39 - 3606, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 39 - 3606. MONITORING AND USE OF REFERENCE STREAMS OR CONDITIONS TO DE- TERMINE FULL SUPPORT OF BENEFICIAL USES AND BENEFICIAL USE SUPPORT ASSESS- MENT . (1) The director , in consultation with the basin advisory group, shall conduct monitoring to determine if whether designated beneficial uses of wa- ter bodies are fully supported. In making such determination s , the director shall consult with the basin advisory group and the watershed advisory group with the responsibilities described in this chapter for the water body. The director shall use the appropriate water quality standards as identified in the rules of the department and shall compare the physical, chemical and bi- ological measures of the water body in question with the reference stream or condition appropriate to the land type, land uses , hydrology, water uses and geophysical features of the water body in question as described in section 39 - 3605(2), Idaho Code. If the water body in question has such physical, chemical or biological measures as the reference water body stream or con- dition, even though such measures may be diminished from the conditions set forth in section 39 - 3605(1), Idaho Code, then the director shall deem the designated beneficial uses for the water in question body to be fully sup- ported and as having achieved the objectives of the federal clean water act and of this chapter. When site - specific standards have been developed for an activity pursuant to the rules of the department, the use of reference streams as described in this section shall not be necessary. (2) The physical, geological, hydrological, atmospheric, chemical or biological measures of a water body to be used to determine whether beneficial uses are fully supported may include, but are not limited to: stream width, stream depth, stream shade, sediment, bank stability, water flows, physical characteristics of the stream that affect habitat for fish, macroinvertebrate species or other aquatic life, and the variety and number of fish or other aquatic life. SECTION 5. That Section 39 - 3607, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 39 - 3607. MONITORING TO DETERMINE SUPPORT REVISIONS AND ATTAINABILITY OF BENEFICIAL USES. The director shall , in consultation with the appropri- ate basin advisory group and watershed advisory group, conduct a beneficial use attainability and status survey assessment to identify appropriate designated uses and to determine the status of designated beneficial uses in each water body. Measures to determine appropriate designated uses and the status of designated beneficial uses shall include appropriate water quality standards as identified in the rules of the department in conjunc- tion with biological or aquatic habitat measures that may include, but are not limited to: stream width, stream depth, stream shade, sediment, bank stability, water flows, physical characteristics of the stream that affect habitat for fish, macroinvertebrate species or other aquatic life, and the variety and number of fish or other aquatic life determine whether benefi- cial uses should be revised. Designated uses shall be reviewed and revised C. 349 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 947 when such physical, geological, hydrological, atmospheric, chemical or biological measures indicate the need to do so. The director shall consider the economic costs required to attain a revised beneficial use. A designated use, that is not an existing use, shall be removed when it is demonstrated that attaining the use is not feasible, using those factors set forth in 40 CFR 131.10(g) . Previous assessments of beneficial use attainability and status which that are of a quality and content acceptable to the director shall constitute the baseline data against which future assessments shall be made to deter- mine changes in the water body and what beneficial uses can be attained in it. In addition, the director, to the extent possible, may determine whether changes in the condition of the water body are the result of past or ongoing point or nonpoint source activities. The director shall also seek informa- tion from appropriate public agencies regarding land uses , water uses and geological or other information for the watershed which that may affect wa- ter quality and the ability of the water body in question to fully support or attain designated beneficial uses. In carrying out the provisions of this section, the director may contract with private enterprises or public agen- cies to provide the desired data. SECTION 6. That Section 39 - 3609, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 39 - 3609. IDENTIFICATION OF WATER BODIES WHERE BENEFICIAL USES ARE NOT FULLY SUPPORTED.

(d) For any school district with one (1) or more separate secondary schools serving grades nine (9) through twelve (12), the instructional staff allowance shall be increased by two (2) additional instructional staff allowances for each such separate secondary school. (e) Only instructional, administrative and classified personnel compensated by the school district from the general maintenance and operation fund of the district shall be included in the calculation of staff allowance or in any other calculations based upon staff, in- cluding determination of the experience and education multiplier, the reporting requirements, or the district's salary - based apportionment calculation. No food service staff or transportation staff shall be included in the staff allowance. (f) A district may utilize up to five fifteen percent ( 1 5%) of the mon- eys associated with positions funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to pay another school district or public charter school for in- structional services or to defray the cost of providing virtual educa- tion coursework, including virtual dual credit coursework, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed. (g) For the period July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2011, only, a district may shift up to five percent (5%) of the positions funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to federal funds, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed. (h) A district may employ nine and one - half percent (9.5%) fewer posi- tions than funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed.

STAFF ALLOWANCE. For each school district, a staff allowance shall be determined as follows: (1) Using the daily attendance reports that have been submitted for computing the February 15 apportionment of state funds as provided in sec- tion 33 - 1009, Idaho Code, determine the total support units for the district in the manner provided in section 33 - 1002(6)(a), Idaho Code; (2) Determine the instructional staff allowance by multiplying the support units by 1.1. A district must demonstrate that it actually employs the number of certificated instructional staff allowed, except as provided in subsection (5)(f) and (g) of this section. If the district does not employ the number allowed, the staff allowance shall be reduced to the actual number employed, except as provided in subsection (5)(f) and (g) of this section; (3) Determine the administrative staff allowance by multiplying the support units by .075; 950 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 349 2013 (4) Determine the classified staff allowance by multiplying the sup- port units by .375; (5) Additional conditions governing staff allowance: (a) In determining the number of staff in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section, a district may contract separately for services to be rendered by nondistrict employees and such employees may be counted in the staff allowance. A \"nondistrict employee\" means a person for whom the school district does not pay the employer's obligations for employee benefits. When a district contracts for the services of a nondistrict employee, only the salary portion of the contract shall be allowable for computations. (b) If there are circumstances preventing eligible use of staff al- lowance to which a district is entitled as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, an appeal may be filed with the state department of education outlining the reasons and proposed alternative use of these funds, and a waiver may be granted. (c) For any district with less than forty (40) support units: (i) The instructional staff allowance shall be calculated applying the actual number of support units. If the actual in- structional staff employed in the school year is greater than the instructional staff allowance, then the instructional staff allowance shall be increased by one - half (1/2) staff allowance; and (ii) The administrative staff allowance shall be calculated ap- plying the actual number of support units. If the actual adminis- trative staff employed in the school year is greater than the ad- ministrative staff allowance, then the administrative staff al- lowance shall be increased by one - half (1/2) staff allowance. (iii) Additionally, for any district with less than twenty (20) support units, the instructional staff allowance shall be calcu- lated applying the actual number of support units. If the number of instructional staff employed in the school year is greater than the instructional staff allowance, the staff allowance shall be increased as provided in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this para- graph, and by an additional one - half (1/2) instructional staff al- lowance. (d) For any school district with one (1) or more separate secondary schools serving grades nine (9) through twelve (12), the instructional staff allowance shall be increased by two (2) additional instructional staff allowances for each such separate secondary school. (e) Only instructional, administrative and classified personnel compensated by the school district from the general maintenance and operation fund of the district shall be included in the calculation of staff allowance or in any other calculations based upon staff, in- cluding determination of the experience and education multiplier, the reporting requirements, or the district's salary - based apportionment calculation. No food service staff or transportation staff shall be included in the staff allowance. (f) A district may utilize up to five percent (5%) of the moneys asso- ciated with positions funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to defray the cost of providing virtual education coursework, includ- ing virtual dual credit coursework, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed. (g) For the period July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2011, only, a district may shift up to five percent (5%) of the positions funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to federal funds, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed. (6) In the event that the staff allowance in any category is insuffi- cient to meet accreditation standards, a district may appeal to the state C. 350 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 951 board of education, demonstrating the insufficiency, and the state board may grant a waiver authorizing sufficient additional staff to be included within the staff allowance to meet accreditation standards. Such a waiver shall be limited to one (1) year, but may be renewed upon showing of continuing justi- fication. SECTION 4.

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho: SECTION 1. That Section 33 - 514, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 514. ISSUANCE OF ANNUAL CONTRACTS - - SUPPORT PROGRAMS - - CATE- GORIES OF CONTRACTS - - OPTIONAL PLACEMENT. (1) The board of trustees shall establish criteria and procedures for the supervision and evaluation of certificated employees who are not employed on a renewable contract, as provided for in section 33 - 515, Idaho Code. (2) There shall be three (3) categories of annual contracts available to local school districts under which to employ certificated personnel: (a) A category 1 contract is a limited one - year contract as provided in section 33 - 514A, Idaho Code. (b) A category 2 contract is for certificated personnel in the first and second years of continuous employment with the same school district. Upon the decision by a local school board not to reemploy the person for the following year, the certificated employee shall be provided a written statement of reasons for non - reemployment by no later than May 25 the first day of July . No property rights shall attach to a category 2 contract and therefore the employee shall not be entitled to a review by the local board of the reasons or decision not to reemploy. (c) A category 3 contract is for certificated personnel during the third year of continuous employment by the same school district. District procedures shall require at least one (1) evaluation prior to the beginning of the second semester of the school year and the results of any such evaluation shall be made a matter of record in the employee's personnel file. When any such employee's work is found to be unsatisfactory , a defined period of probation shall be established by the board, but in no case shall a probationary period be less than eight (8) weeks. After the probationary period, action shall be taken by the board as to whether the employee is to be retained, immediately C. 353 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 955 discharged, discharged upon termination of the current contract or reemployed at the end of the contract term under a continued proba- tionary status. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 67 - 2344 and 67 - 2345, Idaho Code, a decision to place certificated personnel on probationary status may be made in executive session and the employee shall not be named in the minutes of the meeting. A record of the deci- sion shall be placed in the employee's personnel file. This procedure shall not preclude recognition of unsatisfactory work at a subsequent evaluation and the establishment of a reasonable period of probation. In all instances, the employee shall be duly notified in writing of the areas of work which are deficient, including the conditions of probation. Each such certificated employee on a category 3 contract shall be given notice, in writing, whether he or she will be reemployed for the next ensuing year. Such notice shall be given by the board of trustees no later than the twenty - fifth day of May first day of July of each such year. If the board of trustees has decided not to reemploy the certificated employee, then the notice must contain a statement of reasons for such decision and the employee shall, upon request, be given the opportunity for an informal review of such decision by the board of trustees. The parameters of an informal review shall be determined by the local board. (3) School districts hiring an employee who has been on renewable contract status with another Idaho district , or has out - of - state experience which would otherwise qualify the certificated employee for renewable contract status in Idaho, shall have the option to immediately grant re- newable contract status, or to place the employee on a category 3 annual contract. Such employment on a category 3 contract under the provisions of this subsection may be for one (1), two (2) or three (3) years. (4) There shall be a minimum of two (2) written evaluations in each of the annual contract years of employment, and at least one (1) evaluation shall be completed before January 1 of each year. The provisions of this subsection (4) shall not apply to employees on a category 1 contract. SECTION 2. That Section 33 - 515, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 515. ISSUANCE OF RENEWABLE CONTRACTS. (1) During the third full year of continuous employment by the same school district, including any specially chartered district, each certificated employee named in subsec- tion (16) of section 33 - 1001, Idaho Code, and each school nurse and school librarian shall be evaluated for a renewable contract and shall, upon having been offered a contract for the next ensuing year, having given notice of acceptance of renewal and upon signing and timely returning a contract for a fourth full year, be placed on a renewable contract status with said school district entitling such individual to the right to automatic renewal of contract, subject to the provisions included in this chapter. (2) After the third full year of employment and a A t least once annually, the performance of each such renewable contract certificated employee, school nurse, or school librarian shall be evaluated according to criteria and procedures established by the board of trustees in accordance with general guidelines approved by the state board of education. Except as otherwise provided, that person shall have the right to automatic renewal of contract by giving notice, in writing, of acceptance of renewal. Such notice shall be given to the board of trustees of the school district then employing such person not later than the first day of June preceding the expiration of the term of the current contract. Except as otherwise provided by this para- graph, the board of trustees shall notify each person entitled to be employed on a renewable contract of the requirement that such person must give the notice hereinabove and that failure to do so may be interpreted by the board 956 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 353 2013 as a declination of the right to automatic renewal or the offer of another contract. Such notification shall be made, in writing, not later than the fifteenth day of May, in each year, except to those persons to whom the board, prior to said date, has sent proposed contracts for the next ensuing year, or to whom the board has given the notice required by this section. (3) Any contract automatically renewed under the provisions of this section shall be for the same length as the term stated in the current contract and at a salary no lower than that specified therein, to which shall be added such increments as may be determined by the statutory or regulatory rights of such employee by reason of training, service, or performance, except where a board of trustees has declared a financial emergency pursuant to section 33 - 522, Idaho Code may be renewed for a shorter term, longer term or the same length of term as stated in the current contract and at a greater, lesser or equal salary as that stated in the current contract . Absent the board's application of a formal reduction in force, renewals of standard teacher contacts may be for a shorter term, longer term or the same length of term as stated in the current standard teacher contract and at a greater, lesser or equal salary, and shall be uniformly applied to all employees based upon the district's adopted salary schedule to the extent allowable in section 33 - 1004E, Idaho Code. (a) Contracts issued pursuant to this section shall be issued on or be- fore the first day of July each year. (b) At the discretion of the board, the district may issue letters of intent for employment for the next ensuing school year, to renewable contract status employees during May of each school year. Such let- ter of intent shall not state a specific duration of the contract or salary/benefits term for the next ensuing school year. (c) Unless otherwise negotiated and ratified by both parties pursuant to sections 33 - 1271, et seq., Idaho Code, for the 2013 - 2014 school year, standard teacher renewals for terms shorter in length than that stated in the current standard contract of renewable certificated employees, should be considered and implemented only after the district has determined that the salary - based apportionment reimbursement that it estimates it will receive for the 2013 - 2014 school year is less than the sum the district would otherwise be paying for salaries for certificated professional employees. (4) Nothing in this section shall prevent the board of trustees from of- fering a renewed contract increasing the salary of any certificated person, or from reassigning an administrative employee to a nonadministrative posi- tion with appropriate reduction of salary from the preexisting salary level. In the event the board of trustees reassigns an administrative employee to a nonadministrative position, the board shall give written notice to the em- ployee which contains a statement of the reasons for the reassignment. The employee, upon written request to the board, shall be entitled to an informal review of that decision. The process and procedure for the informal review shall be determined by the local board of trustees. (5) Before a board of trustees can determine not to renew for reasons of an unsatisfactory report of the performance of any certificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, or to renew the contract of any such person at a reduced salary, such person shall be entitled to a reasonable period of probation. This period of probation shall be preceded by a written notice from the board of trustees with reasons for such proba- tionary period and with provisions for adequate supervision and evaluation of the person's performance during the probationary period. Such period of probation shall not affect the person's renewable contract status. Consid- eration of probationary status for certificated personnel is consideration of the status of an employee within the meaning of section 67 - 2345, Idaho Code, and may be held in executive session. If the consideration results in probationary status, the individual on probation shall not be named in C. 353 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 957 the minutes of the meeting. A record of the decision shall be placed in the teacher's personnel file. (6) If the board of trustees takes action to immediately discharge or discharge upon termination of the current contract a certificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, or to renew the contract of any such person at a reduced salary, the action of the board shall be consistent with the procedures specified in section 33 - 513(5), Idaho Code, and furthermore, the board shall notify the employee in writing whether there is just and reasonable cause not to renew the contract or to reduce the salary of the affected employee, and if so, what reasons it relied upon in that determination. (7) If the board of trustees takes action after the declaration of a financial emergency pursuant to section 33 - 522, Idaho Code, and such action is directed at more than one (1) certificated employee and, if mutually agreed to by both parties, a single informal review shall be conducted. Without mutual consent of both parties, the board of trustees shall use the following procedure to conduct a single due process hearing within sixty - seven (67) days of the declaration of financial emergency pursuant to section 33 - 522(2), Idaho Code, or on or before June 22, whichever shall occur first: (a) The superintendent or any other duly authorized administrative of- ficer of the school district may recommend the change in the length of the term stated in the current contract or reduce the salary of any cer- tificated employee by filing with the board of trustees written notice specifying the purported reasons for such changes. (b) Upon receipt of such notice, the board of trustees, acting through its duly authorized administrative official, shall give the affected employees written notice of the reductions and the recommendation of the change in the length of the term stated in the current contract or the reduction of salary, along with written notice of a hearing before the board of trustees prior to any determination by the board of trustees. (c) The hearing shall be scheduled to take place not less than six (6) days nor more than fourteen (14) days after receipt of the notice by the employees. The date provided for the hearing may be changed by mutual consent. (d) The hearing shall be open to the public. (e) All testimony at the hearing shall be given under oath or affirma- tion. Any member of the board, or the clerk of the board of trustees, may administer oaths to witnesses or affirmations by witnesses. (f) The employees may be represented by legal counsel and/ o r by a repre- sentative of a local or state education association. (g) The chairman of the board of trustees or the designee of the chair- man shall conduct the hearing. (h) The board of trustees shall cause an electronic record of the hear- ing to be made or shall employ a competent reporter to take stenographic or stenotype notes of all the testimony at the hearing. A transcript of the hearing shall be provided at cost by the board of trustees upon re- quest of the employee. (i) At the hearing , the superintendent or other duly authorized admin- istrative officer shall present evidence to substantiate the reduction contained in such notice. (j) The employees may produce evidence to refute the reduction. Any witness presented by the superintendent or by the employees shall be subject to cross - examination. The board of trustees may also examine witnesses and be represented by counsel. (k) The affected employees may file written briefs and arguments with the board of trustees within three (3) days after the close of the hear- 958 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 353 2013 ing or such other time as may be agreed upon by the affected employees and the board of trustees. (l) Within seven (7) days following the close of the hearing, the board of trustees shall determine and, acting through its duly authorized ad- ministrative official, shall notify the employees in writing whether the evidence presented at the hearing established the need for the ac- tion taken. The due process hearing pursuant to this subsection (7) shall not be required if the board of trustees and the local education association reach an agree- ment on issues agreed upon pursuant to section 33 - 522(3), Idaho Code. (8) If the board of trustees, for reasons other than unsatisfactory service, for the ensuing contract year, determines to change the length of the term stated in the current contract, reduce the salary or not renew the contract of a certificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, nothing herein shall require a probationary period. (9) If the board of trustees, for reasons other than unsatisfactory service, for the ensuing contract year, determines to change the length of the term stated in the current contract or reduce the salary of a cer- tificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, nothing herein shall require any individualized due process proceeding. In such circumstance, the board shall hold a single informal review for all impacted employees. The process and procedure for the single informal review shall be determined by the local board of trustees. SECTION 3. That Sections 33 - 514 and 33 - 515, Idaho Code, be, and the same are hereby repealed. SECTION 4. That Chapter 5, Title 33, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION , to be known and des- ignated as Section 33 - 514, Idaho Code, and to read as follows: 33 - 514. ISSUANCE OF ANNUAL CONTRACTS - - SUPPORT PROGRAMS - - CATE- GORIES OF CONTRACTS - - OPTIONAL PLACEMENT. (1) The board of trustees shall establish criteria and procedures for the supervision and evaluation of certificated employees who are not employed on a renewable contract, as provided for in section 33 - 515, Idaho Code. (2) There shall be three (3) categories of annual contracts available to local school districts under which to employ certificated personnel: (a) A category 1 contract is a limited one - year contract as provided in section 33 - 514A, Idaho Code. (b) A category 2 contract is for certificated personnel in the first and second years of continuous employment with the same school district. Upon the decision by a local school board not to reemploy the person for the following year, the certificated employee shall be provided a written statement of reasons for non - reemployment by no later than May 25. No property rights shall attach to a category 2 contract and therefore the employee shall not be entitled to a review by the local board of the reasons or decision not to reemploy. (c) A category 3 contract is for certificated personnel during the third year of continuous employment by the same school district. Dis- trict procedures shall require at least one (1) evaluation prior to the beginning of the second semester of the school year and the results of any such evaluation shall be made a matter of record in the employee's personnel file.

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 67 - 2344 and 67 - 2345, Idaho Code, a decision to place certificated personnel on probationary status may be made in executive session and the employee shall not be named in the minutes of the meeting. A record of the decision shall be placed in the employee's personnel file. This procedure shall not preclude recognition of unsatisfactory work at a subsequent evaluation and the establishment of a reasonable period of probation. In all instances, the employee shall be duly notified in writing of the areas of work which are deficient, including the conditions of probation. Each such certificated employee on a category 3 contract shall be given notice, in writing, whether he or she will be reemployed for the next ensuing year. Such notice shall be given by the board of trustees no later than the twenty - fifth day of May of each such year. If the board of trustees has decided not to reemploy the certificated employee, then the notice must contain a statement of reasons for such decision and the employee shall, upon request, be given the opportunity for an informal review of such decision by the board of trustees. The parameters of an informal review shall be determined by the local board. (3) School districts hiring an employee who has been on renewable contract status with another Idaho district or has out - of - state experience which would otherwise qualify the certificated employee for renewable contract status in Idaho, shall have the option to immediately grant re- newable contract status, or to place the employee on a category 3 annual contract. Such employment on a category 3 contract under the provisions of this subsection may be for one (1), two (2) or three (3) years. (4) There shall be a minimum of two (2) written evaluations in each of the annual contract years of employment, and at least one (1) evaluation shall be completed before January 1 of each year.

That Chapter 5, Title 33, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION , to be known and des- ignated as Section 33 - 515, Idaho Code, and to read as follows: 33 - 515. ISSUANCE OF RENEWABLE CONTRACTS. (1) During the third full year of continuous employment by the same school district, including any specially chartered district, each certificated employee named in subsec- tion (16) of section 33 - 1001, Idaho Code, and each school nurse and school librarian shall be evaluated for a renewable contract and shall, upon having been offered a contract for the next ensuing year, having given notice of acceptance of renewal and upon signing a contract for a fourth full year, be placed on a renewable contract status with said school district subject to the provisions included in this chapter. (2) After the third full year of employment and at least once annu- ally, the performance of each such certificated employee, school nurse, or school librarian shall be evaluated according to criteria and procedures established by the board of trustees in accordance with general guidelines approved by the state board of education. Except as otherwise provided, that person shall have the right to automatic renewal of contract by giving notice, in writing, of acceptance of renewal. Such notice shall be given to the board of trustees of the school district then employing such person not later than the first day of June preceding the expiration of the term of the current contract. Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, the board of trustees shall notify each person entitled to be employed on a renewable contract of the requirement that such person must give the notice hereinabove and that failure to do so may be interpreted by the board as a declination of the right to automatic renewal or the offer of another contract. Such notification shall be made, in writing, not later than the 960 IDAHO SESSION LAWS C. 353 2013 fifteenth day of May, in each year, except to those persons to whom the board, prior to said date, has sent proposed contracts for the next ensuing year, or to whom the board has given the notice required by this section. (3) Any contract automatically renewed under the provisions of this section shall be for the same length as the term stated in the current contract and at a salary no lower than that specified therein, to which shall be added such increments as may be determined by the statutory or regulatory rights of such employee by reason of training, service, or performance, except where a board of trustees has declared a financial emergency pursuant to section 33 - 522, Idaho Code. (4) Nothing in this section shall prevent the board of trustees from of- fering a renewed contract increasing the salary of any certificated person, or from reassigning an administrative employee to a nonadministrative posi- tion with appropriate reduction of salary from the preexisting salary level. In the event the board of trustees reassigns an administrative employee to a nonadministrative position, the board shall give written notice to the em- ployee which contains a statement of the reasons for the reassignment. The employee, upon written request to the board, shall be entitled to an informal review of that decision. The process and procedure for the informal review shall be determined by the local board of trustees. (5) Before a board of trustees can determine not to renew for reasons of an unsatisfactory report of the performance of any certificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, or to renew the contract of any such person at a reduced salary, such person shall be entitled to a reasonable period of probation. This period of probation shall be preceded by a written notice from the board of trustees with reasons for such proba- tionary period and with provisions for adequate supervision and evaluation of the person's performance during the probationary period. Such period of probation shall not affect the person's renewable contract status. Consid- eration of probationary status for certificated personnel is consideration of the status of an employee within the meaning of section 67 - 2345, Idaho Code, and may be held in executive session. If the consideration results in probationary status, the individual on probation shall not be named in the minutes of the meeting. A record of the decision shall be placed in the teacher's personnel file. (6) If the board of trustees takes action to immediately discharge or discharge upon termination of the current contract a certificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, or to renew the contract of any such person at a reduced salary, the action of the board shall be consistent with the procedures specified in section 33 - 513 5., Idaho Code, and furthermore, the board shall notify the employee in writing whether there is just and reasonable cause not to renew the contract or to reduce the salary of the affected employee, and if so, what reasons it relied upon in that determination. (7) If the board of trustees takes action after the declaration of a financial emergency pursuant to section 33 - 522, Idaho Code, and such action is directed at more than one (1) certificated employee and, if mutually agreed to by both parties, a single informal review shall be conducted. Without mutual consent of both parties, the board of trustees shall use the following procedure to conduct a single due process hearing within sixty - seven (67) days of the declaration of financial emergency pursuant to section 33 - 522(2), Idaho Code, or on or before June 22, whichever shall occur first: (a) The superintendent or any other duly authorized administrative of- ficer of the school district may recommend the change in the length of the term stated in the current contract or reduce the salary of any cer- tificated employee by filing with the board of trustees written notice specifying the purported reasons for such changes. C. 353 2013 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 961 (b) Upon receipt of such notice, the board of trustees, acting through its duly authorized administrative official, shall give the affected employees written notice of the reductions and the recommendation of the change in the length of the term stated in the current contract or the reduction of salary, along with written notice of a hearing before the board of trustees prior to any determination by the board of trustees. (c) The hearing shall be scheduled to take place not less than six (6) days nor more than fourteen (14) days after receipt of the notice by the employees. The date provided for the hearing may be changed by mutual consent. (d) The hearing shall be open to the public. (e) All testimony at the hearing shall be given under oath or affirma- tion. Any member of the board, or the clerk of the board of trustees, may administer oaths to witnesses or affirmations by witnesses. (f) The employees may be represented by legal counsel and/or by a repre- sentative of a local or state education association. (g) The chairman of the board of trustees or the designee of the chair- man shall conduct the hearing. (h) The board of trustees shall cause an electronic record of the hear- ing to be made or shall employ a competent reporter to take stenographic or stenotype notes of all the testimony at the hearing. A transcript of the hearing shall be provided at cost by the board of trustees upon re- quest of the employee. (i) At the hearing the superintendent or other duly authorized admin- istrative officer shall present evidence to substantiate the reduction contained in such notice. (j) The employees may produce evidence to refute the reduction. Any witness presented by the superintendent or by the employees shall be subject to cross - examination. The board of trustees may also examine witnesses and be represented by counsel. (k) The affected employees may file written briefs and arguments with the board of trustees within three (3) days after the close of the hear- ing or such other time as may be agreed upon by the affected employees and the board of trustees. (l) Within seven (7) days following the close of the hearing, the board of trustees shall determine and, acting through its duly authorized ad- ministrative official, shall notify the employees in writing whether the evidence presented at the hearing established the need for the ac- tion taken. The due process hearing pursuant to this subsection (7) shall not be required if the board of trustees and the local education association reach an agree- ment on issues agreed upon pursuant to section 33 - 522(3), Idaho Code. (8) If the board of trustees, for reasons other than unsatisfactory service, for the ensuing contract year, determines to change the length of the term stated in the current contract, reduce the salary or not renew the contract of a certificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, nothing herein shall require a probationary period.

No. 1) A JOINT MEMORIAL TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED, TO THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION REPRESENTING THE STATE OF IDAHO IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, TO THE SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND TO THE CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE. We, your Memorialists, the House of Representatives and the Senate of the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Sixty - second Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that: WHEREAS, the State of Idaho and the vast Frank Church - River of No Return Wilderness and contiguous national forests have suffered numerous and fre- quent large destructive forest and range fires, most recently in 2012; and WHEREAS, the fires have not only incrementally expanded the total burned acreage but have also reburned huge areas one or more times; and WHEREAS, the cumulative effect of numerous large fires has resulted in tremendous damage and destruction to the watersheds, streams important to the recovery of anadromous fish, wildlife habitat, scenic values, recre- ational use, loss of native plant species, historic structures, public access and safety, air quality and public health, the trail network and other values and benefits for which the national forests and wilderness were established; and WHEREAS, the cumulative and growing loss of wilderness values and at- tributes is also resulting in serious economic impact to surrounding commu- nities, counties, the State of Idaho and the businesses dependent upon the natural resources inherent in wilderness and the national forests; and WHEREAS, hundreds of miles of trails have been severely damaged, blocked, rendered unsafe for travel or simply wiped out by fire, and the continuing destructive aftermath of blowdown, washouts and landslides have not been opened, cleared, repaired or replaced. The backlog of critical restoration work is rapidly growing each year and far exceeds the work performed annually; and WHEREAS, the cumulative impact of fires has resulted in the loss of soil and native vegetation and the replacement of native species with noxious and undesirable plants that will also prevent or retard reestablishment of de- sirable native plants; and WHEREAS, the United States Forest Service has underestimated the huge cost of trail and resource restoration when making decisions on active fire strategies in the wilderness due to a decision bias toward minimizing suppression expenditures for wilderness fires at the expense of long - term restoration; and IDAHO SESSION LAWS 973 WHEREAS, the United States Forest Service has not placed the necessary emphasis and priority on restoration of proper watershed and vegetative con- ditions within the wilderness, and has also not considered the negative ef- fect of vegetative type conversion resulting from intense and/or repetitive burns; and WHEREAS, the United States Forest Service has not placed emphasis and priority on training for forest supervisors, rangers and staff on the impor- tance of safe and effective saddle and pack stock use and management, and the field conditions necessary for reasonable and safe public and employee ac- cess to and within the wilderness; and WHEREAS, the United States Forest Service has not placed emphasis and priority on eliminating barriers to effective and streamlined contracting procedures and effective use of volunteers in order to respond to the crisis in the wilderness and maximize fieldwork accomplishment; and WHEREAS, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Chief of the United States Forest Service have not placed the necessary emphasis and priority of the re- quirement of Section 5(b) of the Central Idaho Wilderness Act to clear ob- structions from all trails within and adjacent to the wilderness on at least an annual basis; and WHEREAS, the Chief of the United States Forest Service has not programmed on a continuing basis even normal repair, replacement and main- tenance of the trail system and trail structures such as bridges, trail tread, drainage, associated signing and other essential actions to enable safe public use, full and unimpeded public access by foot and horseback and the public services that are vital to public use and enjoyment of the wilderness, in order to prevent cumulative deterioration of the system under even non - fire conditions; and WHEREAS, the Chief of the United States Forest Service has not placed emphasis on efficient and economical methods of trail restoration and main- tenance, and has in fact aggressively limited methods and tools by Forest Service crews, contractors and volunteers that would greatly increase ac- complishment and lower costs without adverse effect on wilderness values or visitors; and WHEREAS, use of outfitter and guide permittees, contractors and volun- teers from various organizations to accomplish trail work is well below po- tential due to a lack of emphasis by the United States Forest Service on using innovative ways to offset permittee fees and streamline and simplify con- tracting procedures. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Session of the Sixty - second Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that we urge the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture to declare the Frank Church - River of No Re- turn Wilderness and adjacent national forest lands to be a Natural Resources Disaster Area. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that we urge the Secretary of Agriculture and the Chief of the United States Forest Service to recognize the dire con- ditions prevailing within and adjacent to the Frank Church - River of No Return Wilderness and adjacent national forests, and further urge that the necessary priorities and emphasis be placed on prompt and practical actions to prevent further cumulative loss of the unique values of the wilderness. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that we urge compliance with the specific re- quirements of the Central Idaho Wilderness Act mandating annual clearing of obstructions from the trail system. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chief Clerk of the House of Representa- tives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Repre- sentatives of Congress, the congressional delegation representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States, the Secretary of the United 974 IDAHO SESSION LAWS States Department of Agriculture and the Chief of the United States Forest Service.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses- sion of the Sixty - second Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Rep- resentatives concurring therein, that we urge the Republic of Turkey and the Turkish Patent Institute to honor Idaho's opposition and deny the request for registration of applicant Beta Ziraat Ve Ticaret A.S. to claim the mark \"IDAHO\" for use in identification of products not originating in the State of Idaho.

Adopted by the House January 31, 2013 Adopted by the Senate February 18, 2013 (H.C.R. No. 3) A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION STATING FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND REQUESTING THE STATE BOARD OF EDU- CATION COMMENCE RULEMAKING TO PROVIDE THAT CURSIVE HANDWRITING SHALL BE TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF THIS STATE. Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho: WHEREAS, the Legislature recognizes that handwriting, based upon empirical evidence from neuroscience, plays a major role in the visual recognition and learning of letters; and this is something the State of Idaho should be aware of in an educational context. The State of Idaho recognizes that those who learn to write by hand learn better; and 996 IDAHO SESSION LAWS WHEREAS, there have been studies where cursive handwriting has helped students with their fine motor skills and made them more graceful; these stu- dents show more of an interest in art because they are able to form things they hadn't before and they have new muscle movements that they didn't know before; and WHEREAS, there was an experiment involving two groups of adults in which participants were taught a new, foreign alphabet. One group learned the characters by hand, the other learned only to recognize them on a screen and with a keyboard. Weeks after the experiment, the group that learned the letters by hand consistently scored better on recognition tests than those who learned with a keyboard. Brain scans of the hands - on group also showed greater activity in the part of the brain that controls language comprehension, motor - related processes and speech - associated gestures; and WHEREAS, the Legislature also recognizes that there are reliable scien- tific studies that show, for some important aspects of reading and composi- tion, digital technology may not be as important as handwriting; and WHEREAS, the Legislature also recognizes that if the cursive script is not taught, the time will come when people will not be able to read old di- aries, journals, letters, documents and the like written in cursive. This will have a negative effect on the study of genealogy and family history and will weaken society's relationship to its past. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Session of the Sixty - second Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that the State Board of Education is requested to commence rulemaking to provide that cursive handwriting shall be taught in the public elementary schools of this state. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the State Board of Education shall report its progress in its rulemaking pursuant to this Resolution to the Second Reg- ular Session of the Sixty - second Idaho Legislature.

Adopted by the House March 21, 2013 Adopted by the Senate April 2, 2013 (H.C.R. No. 22) A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION STATING LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DEMANDING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EX- TINGUISH TITLE TO IDAHO'S PUBLIC LANDS AND TRANSFER TITLE TO THOSE LANDS TO THE STATE OF IDAHO. Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho: WHEREAS, in 1780, the United States Congress resolved that \"the unap- propriated lands that may be ceded or relinquished to the United States, by any particular states, pursuant to the recommendation of Congress of the 6 day of September last, shall be granted and disposed of for the common benefit of all the United States that shall be members of the federal union, and be settled and formed into distinct republican states, which shall become members of the federal union, and have the same rights of sovereignty, freedom and independence, as the other states: and that upon such cession being made by any State and approved and accepted by Congress, the United States shall guaranty the remaining territory of the said States respec- tively. (Resolution of Congress, October 10, 1780)\"; and WHEREAS, the territorial and public lands of the United States are dealt with in Clause 2, Section 3, Article IV, of the United States Constitution, referred to as the Property Clause, which states, \"The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.\"; and WHEREAS, with this clause, the Constitutional Convention agreed that the Constitution would maintain the \"status quo\" that had been established with respect to the federal territorial lands being disposed of only to cre- ate new states with the same rights of sovereignty, freedom and independence as the original states; and WHEREAS, under these express terms of trust, the land claiming states, over time, ceded their western land to their confederated union and retained their claims that the confederated government dispose of such lands only to 1008 IDAHO SESSION LAWS create new states \"and for no other use or purpose whatsoever\" and apply the net proceeds of any sales of such lands only for the purpose of paying down the public debt; and WHEREAS, with respect to the disposition of the federal territorial lands, the Northwest Ordinance of July 13, 1787, provides, \"The legislatures of those districts or new States, shall never interfere with the primary disposal of the soil by the United States in Congress assembled, nor with any regulations Congress may find necessary for securing the title in such soil to the bona fide purchasers\"; and WHEREAS, by resolution in 1790, the United States Congress declared \"That the proceeds of sales which shall be made of lands in the Western territory, now belonging or that may hereafter belong to the United States, shall be, and are hereby appropriated towards sinking or discharging the debts for the payment whereof the United States now are, or by virtue of this act may be holden, and shall be applied solely to that use, until the said debt shall be fully satisfied\"; and WHEREAS, the intent of the founding fathers to eventually extinguish title to all public lands was reaffirmed by President Andrew Jackson in a message to the United States Senate on December 4, 1833, where he explained the reasons he vetoed a bill entitled \"An act to appropriate for a limited time the proceeds of the sales of the public lands of the United States and for granting lands to certain States\": \"I do not doubt that it is the real interest of each and all the States in the Union, and particularly of the new States, that the price of these lands shall be reduced and graduated, and that after they have been offered for a certain number of years the refuse remaining unsold shall be abandoned to the States and the machinery of our land system entirely withdrawn. It can not be supposed the compacts intended that the United States should retain forever a title to lands within the States which are of no value, and no doubt is entertained that the general interest would be best promoted by surrendering such lands to the States\"; and WHEREAS, in 1828, United States Supreme Court Chief Justice John Mar- shall, in American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 26 U.S. 511 (1828), confirmed that no provision in the Constitution authorized the federal gov- ernment to indefinitely exercise control over western public lands beyond the duty to manage these lands pending the disposal of the lands to create new states when he said, \"At the time the Constitution was formed, the lim- its of the territory over which it was to operate were generally defined and recognised [sic]. These limits consisted in part, of organized states, and in part of territories, the absolute property and dependencies of the United States. These states, this territory, and future states to be admitted into the Union, are the sole objects of the Constitution; there is no express pro- vision whatever made in the Constitution for the acquisition or government of territories beyond those Limits.\"; and WHEREAS, in 1833, referring to these land cession compacts which arose from the original 1780 congressional resolution, President Andrew Jackson stated, \"These solemn compacts, invited by Congress in a resolution declar- ing the purposes to which the proceeds of these lands should be applied, originating before the constitution, and forming the basis on which it was made, bound the United States to a particular course of policy in relation to them by ties as strong as can be invented to secure the faith of nations\" (Land bill veto, December 5, 1833); and WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court, in State of Texas v. White, 74 U.S. 700 (1868), clarified that a state, by definition, includes a de- fined sovereign territory, stating that \"State,\" in the constitutional con- text, is \"a political community of free citizens, occupying a territory of defined boundaries, and organized under a government sanctioned and limited by a written constitution, and established by the consent of the governed,\" IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1009 and added, \"This is undoubtedly the fundamental idea upon which the republi- can institutions of our own country are established\"; and WHEREAS, in Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1 (1894), the United States Supreme Court confirmed that all federal territories, regardless of how acquired, are held in trust to create new states on an equal footing with the original states when it stated, \"Upon the acquisition of a Territory by the United States, whether by cession from one of the States, or by treaty with a foreign country, or by discovery and settlement, the same title and dominion passed to the United States, for the benefit of the whole people, and in trust for the several States to be ultimately created out of the Territory.\"; and WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court has affirmed that the federal government must honor its trust obligation to extinguish title to the public lands for the sovereignty of the new state to be complete, stating once, \"the United States shall have fully executed these trusts, the municipal sover- eignty of the new states will be complete, throughout their respective bor- ders, and they, and the original states, will be upon an equal footing, in all respects ... \"(Pollard v. Hagan, 44 U.S. 212 (1845)); and WHEREAS, the enabling acts of the new states west of the original colonies established the terms upon which all such states were admitted into the union, and contained the same promise to all new states that the federal government would extinguish title to all public lands lying within their respective borders; and WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court looks upon the enabling acts which create new states as \"solemn compacts\" and \"bilateral (two - way) agree- ments\" to be performed \"in a timely fashion\"; and WHEREAS, Section 19, Article XXI, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho provides \"... And the people of the State of Idaho do agree and de- clare that we forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated pub- lic lands lying within the boundaries thereof, and to all lands lying within said limits owned or held by any Indians or Indian tribes; and until the title thereto shall have been extinguished by the United States, the same shall be subject to the disposition of the United States\"; and WHEREAS, the trust obligation of the federal government to timely ex- tinguish title of all public lands lying within the boundaries of the State of Idaho is made even more clear in Section 7 of Idaho's Admissions Act, \"Five percent of the proceeds of the sales of public lands lying within said state which shall be sold by the United States subsequent to the admission of said state into the union after deducting all the expenses incident to the same shall be paid to the said state, to be used as a permanent fund, the interest of which only shall be expended for the support of the common schools within said state\"; and WHEREAS, the federal government confirmed its trust obligation to timely extinguish title to all public lands lying within the boundaries of the State of Idaho by and through the 1934 Taylor Grazing Act, which declared that the act was established \"In order to promote the highest use of the public lands pending its final disposal\"; and WHEREAS, in 1976, after nearly 200 years of trust history regarding the obligation of Congress to extinguish title of western lands to create new states and use the proceeds to discharge its public debts, the United States Congress purported to unilaterally change this solemn promise by and through the Federal Land Policy Management Act (FLPMA), which provides, in part, \"The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States that the public lands be retained in Federal ownership, unless it is determined that disposal of a particular parcel will serve the federal interest\"; and WHEREAS, at the time of the Idaho Admissions Act, the course and prac- tice of the United States Congress with all prior states admitted to the union had been to fully extinguish title, within a reasonable time, to all lands within the boundaries of such states, except for those Indian lands, 1010 IDAHO SESSION LAWS or lands otherwise expressly reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States; and WHEREAS, the State of Idaho did not, and could not have, contemplated or bargained for the United States failing or refusing to abide by its solemn promise to extinguish title to all lands within its defined boundaries within a reasonable time such that the State of Idaho and its permanent fund for its common schools could never realize the bargained - for benefit of the deployment, taxation or economic benefit of all the lands within its defined boundaries; and WHEREAS, from 1780 forward, the federal government only held bare legal title to the western public lands in the nature of a trustee in trust with the solemn obligation to timely extinguish title to such lands to create new states and to use the proceeds to pay the public debt; and WHEREAS, the federal government complied with its promise and solemn obligation to imminently transfer title of public lands lying within the boundaries of all states to the eastern edge of the State of Colorado and also with the State of Hawaii; and WHEREAS, by the terms of Idaho's Admissions Act and State Constitution, Idaho suspended its sovereign right to eventually tax the public lands within its borders, pending final disposition of the public lands; and WHEREAS, the federal government has repeatedly and persistently failed to honor its promises and has refused to abide by the terms of its preexisting solemn obligations to imminently extinguish title to all public lands; and WHEREAS, had Congress honored its promise to Idaho to timely extinguish title to all public lands within Idaho's boundaries, Idaho would have had sovereign control over lands within its borders; and WHEREAS, Congress, by and through FLPMA, unilaterally altered its duty in 1976 to extinguish title to all public lands within Idaho's borders by committing to a policy of retention and a process of comprehensive land man- agement and planning coordinated between the federal government, the states and local governing bodies for access, multiple use and sustained yield of the public lands; and WHEREAS, despite the fact that the federal government had not divested all public lands within Idaho's borders by 1976, this did not alleviate the federal government from its duty to extinguish title and divest itself of federal ownership of remaining public land in Idaho by ceding such land di- rectly to the state as it did with other states; and WHEREAS, since the passage of FLPMA, the federal government has engaged in a persistent pattern and course of conduct in direct violation of the let- ter and spirit of FLPMA through an abject disregard of local resource manage- ment plans, failure and refusal to coordinate and cooperate with the state and local governments, unilateral and oppressive land control edicts to the severe and extreme detriment of the state and its ability to adequately fund education, provide essential government services, secure economic opportu- nities for wage earners and Idaho business, and ensure a stable, prosperous future; and WHEREAS, under the United States Constitution, the American states re- organized to form a more perfect union, yielding up certain portions of their sovereign powers to the elected officers of the government of their union, yet retaining the residuum of sovereignty for the purpose of independent in- ternal self - governance; and WHEREAS, by compact between the original states, territorial lands were divided into \"suitable extents of territory\" and upon attaining a certain population, were to be admitted into the union upon \"an equal footing\" as members possessing \"the same rights of sovereignty, freedom and indepen- dence\" as the original states; and WHEREAS, the federal trust respecting public lands obligates the United States, through their agent, Congress, to extinguish both their government IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1011 jurisdiction and their title on the public lands that are held in trust by the United States for the states in which they are located; and WHEREAS, the state and federal partnership of public lands management has been eroded by an oppressive and overreaching federal management agenda that has adversely impacted the sovereignty and the economies of the State of Idaho and local governments; and WHEREAS, federal land management actions, even when applied exclu- sively to federal lands, directly impact the ability of the State of Idaho to manage its school trust lands in accordance with the mandate of the Idaho Admissions Act and to meet its obligation to the beneficiaries of the trust; and WHEREAS, Idaho has been substantially damaged in its ability to provide funding for education and the common good of the state and to serve a sustain- able, vibrant economy into the future because the federal government has un- duly retained control of nearly two - thirds of the lands lying within Idaho's borders; and WHEREAS, Idaho consistently ranks high among all the states in class size and low in the nation in per pupil spending for education; and WHEREAS, had the federal government disposed of the land in or about 1890, Idaho would have, from that point forward, generated substantial tax revenues and revenues from the sustainable managed use of its natural resources to the benefit of its public schools and to the common good of the state and nation; and WHEREAS, the federal government gives Idaho less than one - half of the net proceeds of mineral lease revenues and severance taxes generated from the lands within Idaho's borders; and WHEREAS, Idaho has been substantially damaged in mineral lease revenues and severance taxes in that, had the federal government extinguished title to all public lands, Idaho would realize one hundred percent of the mineral lease revenues and severance taxes from the lands; and WHEREAS, the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) failure to act affirma- tively on definitive allocation decisions of multiple use activities in re- source management plans has created uncertainty in the future of public land use in Idaho and has caused capital to flee the state; and WHEREAS, the United States Army Corps of Engineers is proposing to ex- tend its jurisdiction to regulate the waters of the United States to areas traditionally dry, except during severe weather events, in violation of the common definition of jurisdictional water; and WHEREAS, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is making deci- sions concerning various species on BLM lands under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act without serious consideration of state wildlife management activities and protection designed to prevent the need for a listing, or recognizing the ability to delist a species, thereby affecting the economic vitality of the state and local region; and WHEREAS, the BLM has not authorized all necessary rangeland improvement projects involving the removal of pinyon - juniper and other climax vegeta- tion, thereby reducing the biological diversity of the range, reducing ri- parian viability and water quality and reducing the availability of forage for both livestock and wildlife; and WHEREAS, Idaho initially supported placing into reserve the various national forests in the state, because Idaho was promised this action would preserve the forest lands as watersheds and for agricultural use, namely timber and other wood products, and grazing; and WHEREAS, this vision and promise of agricultural production on the for- est lands is the reason that the United States Forest Service was made part of the United States Department of Agriculture as opposed to the Department of the Interior; and WHEREAS, the promise of preservation for agricultural use has been bro- ken by recent administrations; and 1012 IDAHO SESSION LAWS WHEREAS, logging, timber and wood products operations on Idaho's national forests have come to a virtual standstill, resulting in forests that are choked with old growth monocultures, loss of aspen diversity, loss of habitat and a threat to community watersheds due to insect infestation and catastrophic fire; and WHEREAS, these conditions are the result of a failure to properly manage the forest lands for their intended use, which is responsible and sustained timber production, watersheds and grazing; and WHEREAS, the only remedy for federal government breaches of Idaho's Ad- missions Act and breaches to the spirit and letter of the promises of FLPMA is for the State of Idaho to take back title and management responsibility of federally managed public lands, which would restore the promises in the solemn compact made at statehood; and WHEREAS, under Clause 17, Section 8, Article I, of the United States Constitution, the federal government is only constitutionally authorized to exercise jurisdiction over and above bare right and title over lands that are \"purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock - Yards, and other needful Buildings\"; and WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court affirmed that the federal gov- ernment only holds lands as a mere \"ordinary proprietor\" and cannot exert ju- risdictional dominion and control over public lands without the consent of the state Legislature, stating, \"Where lands are acquired without such con- sent, the possession of the United States, unless political jurisdiction be ceded to them in some other way, is simply that of an ordinary proprietor (em- phasis added). The property in that case, unless used as a means to carry out the purposes of the government, is subject to the legislative authority and control of the states equally with the property of private individuals.\" (Ft. Leavenworth R. Co. v. Lowe, 114 U.S. 525 (1885)); and WHEREAS, citizens of the State of Idaho have a love of the land and have demonstrated responsible stewardship of lands within state jurisdiction; and WHEREAS, the State of Idaho is willing to sponsor, evaluate and advance the locally driven efforts in a more efficient manner than the federal gov- ernment, to the benefit of all users, including recreation, conservation and the responsible and sustainable management of Idaho's natural resources; and WHEREAS, the State of Idaho has a proven regulatory structure to manage public lands for multiple use and sustainable yield; and WHEREAS, the United States Congress disposed of lands within the bound- aries of the states of Tennessee and Hawaii directly to those states; and WHEREAS, because of the entanglements and rights arising over the 122 years that the federal government has failed to honor its promise to timely extinguish title to public lands and because of the federal government's breach of Idaho's Admissions Act and breach of FLPMA, among other promises made, and the damages resulting from such breaches, the United States Congress should imminently transfer title to all public lands lying within the State of Idaho directly to the State of Idaho, as it did with Hawaii and Tennessee; and WHEREAS, the Legislature of the State of Idaho, upon transfer of title by the federal government of the public lands directly to the state, intends to cede the national park land to the federal government on condition that the lands permanently remain national park lands, that they not be sold, transferred, left in disrepair, or conveyed to any party other than the State of Idaho; and WHEREAS, the Legislature of the State of Idaho, upon transfer of title by the federal government of the public lands directly to the state, intends to cede to the federal government all lands currently designated as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System pursuant to the Wilderness Act IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1013 of 1964, National Monuments, Department of Defense lands and Department of Energy reservations on the condition that they not be sold, transferred, left in disrepair or conveyed to any party other than the State of Idaho; and WHEREAS, in order to effectively address the accumulated entanglements and expectations over Idaho's public lands, including open space, access, multiple use and the management of sustainable yields of Idaho's natural re- sources, an Interim Public Lands Study Committee should be formed to review how to manage multiple use of the public lands and to determine, through a public process, the extent to which public land may be sold, if any; and WHEREAS, to the extent that the Interim Public Lands Study Committee de- termines through a public process that any such land should be sold to pri- vate owners, five percent of the net proceeds should be paid to the Public School Endowment Fund and ninety - five percent of the net proceeds should be paid to the federal government to pay down the federal debt; and WHEREAS, Section 19, Article XXI, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho provides that Indian lands shall remain under the absolute jurisdic- tion and control of the Congress of the United States, Idaho disclaims any title to such land and will observe all treaty rights. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Ses- sion of the Sixty - second Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that in order to provide a fair, justified and equitable remedy for the federal government's past and continuing breaches of its solemn promises to the State of Idaho as set forth in this resolution and to provide for the sufficient and necessary funding of Idaho's public ed- ucation system, the Legislature of the State of Idaho demands that the fed- eral government imminently transfer title to all of the public lands within Idaho's borders directly to the State of Idaho. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature of the State of Idaho urges the United States Congress in the most strenuous terms to engage in good faith communication, cooperation, coordination and consultation with the State of Idaho regarding the transfer of public lands directly to the State of Idaho. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, upon transfer of the public lands directly to the State of Idaho, the Legislature intends to affirmatively cede the national park lands to the federal government, under Clause 17, Section 8, Article I, of the United States Constitution, on condition that the lands permanently remain national park lands, that they not be sold, transferred, left in substantial disrepair or conveyed to any party other than the State of Idaho. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, upon transfer of the public lands directly to the State of Idaho, the Legislature intends to affirmatively cede to the federal government all lands currently designated as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System pursuant to the Wilderness Act of 1964, National Monuments, Department of Defense lands and Department of Energy reservations on condition that they not be sold, transferred, left in substantial disrepair or conveyed to any party other than the State of Idaho. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature calls for the creation of an Interim Public Lands Study Committee to review how to manage access, open space, sustainable yields and the multiple use of the public lands and to determine, through a public process, the extent to which public land may be sold. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, to the extent that the Interim Public Lands Study Committee determines through a public process that any such land should be sold to private owners, five percent of the net proceeds should be paid to the Public School Endowment Fund and ninety - five percent should be paid to the Bureau of the Public Debt to pay down the federal debt. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies of this resolution be sent to the United States Department of the Interior, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker 1014 IDAHO SESSION LAWS of the United States House of Representatives, the members of Idaho's congressional delegation, and the Governors, Senate Presidents and Speakers of the House of the forty - nine other states.

Such deficiencies include, but are not limited to: a lack of uniformity in 1016 IDAHO SESSION LAWS indigency determination, appointment and waiver of counsel, contribution and recoupment practices, public defense contracting practices and data reporting; excessive caseloads and workloads; a lack of independence of the public defense function; a lack of training and resources for attorneys providing public defense services, particularly in the areas of juvenile defense, child protection and mental health commitment; the existence of flat fee contracts for public defense services; and county commissioners' lack of access to information and resources to assist in the provision of public defense; and WHEREAS, the Idaho Criminal Justice Commission's Public Defense Sub- committee's analysis of nationwide approaches to addressing such deficien- cies shows that the most significant trend has been toward state oversight of the public defense system that includes statewide standards and, in many in- stances, state moneys; and WHEREAS, the Idaho Criminal Justice Commission's Public Defense Sub- committee has narrowed its efforts to consideration of a public defense model where, although public defense delivery at the trial level would remain primarily funded and administered at the county level, the authority for a public defense system would be statutorily delegated to an independent commission authorized to promulgate and enforce certain rules and standards with which counties are required to comply, including: statewide training and continuing legal education requirements for public defense attorneys; data reporting requirements; requirements relating to contracts entered into between counties and private providers of public defense services; standards for the qualification of public defense attorneys; and caseload and workload standards for public defense attorneys; and WHEREAS, the Idaho Criminal Justice Commission's Public Defense Sub- committee has also considered a public defense model where the counties' statutory authority to provide for counsel at public expense would be limited to the creation of an office of public defender and a requirement that each county participate in a statewide association of public defense attorneys. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Session of the Sixty - second Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislative Council is autho- rized to appoint a committee to undertake and complete a study of potential approaches to public defense reform including, but not limited to: the creation, funding and implementation of a public defense commission; and requirements that counties operate offices of public defenders and join a statewide association of public defense attorneys.

SECTION 2. That Section 33 - 514, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 1040 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 33 - 514. ISSUANCE OF ANNUAL CONTRACTS - - SUPPORT PROGRAMS - - CATE- GORIES OF CONTRACTS - - OPTIONAL PLACEMENT - - WRITTEN EVALUATION . (1) The board of trustees shall establish criteria and procedures for the super- vision and evaluation of certificated employees who are not employed on a renewable contract, as provided for in section 33 - 515, Idaho Code. (2) There shall be three two ( 3 2 ) categories of annual contracts avail- able to local school districts under which to employ certificated personnel: (a) A category 1 A contract is a limited one - year contract as provided in section 33 - 514A, Idaho Code. (b) A category 2 contract is one (1) year contract for certificated personnel in the first and second or greater years of continuous employ- ment with the same school district. Upon the decision by a local school board not to reemploy the person for the following year, the certifi- cated employee shall be provided a written statement of reasons for non - reemployment by no later than May 25 July 1 . Provided however, that no such decision shall be made until after the completion of the written evaluation required by subsection (4) of this section, unless such decision is being made pursuant to a reduction in force. No property rights shall attach to a category 2 A contract and therefore the employee shall not be entitled to a review by the local board of trustees of the reasons or decision not to reemploy. ( c b ) A category 3 contract is for certificated personnel during the third year of continuous employment by the same school district. Dis- trict procedures shall require at least one (1) evaluation prior to the beginning of the second semester of the school year and the results of any such evaluation shall be made a matter of record in the employee's personnel file. When any such employee's work is found to be unsatis- factory a defined period of probation shall be established by the board, but in no case shall a probationary period be less than eight (8) weeks. After the probationary period, action shall be taken by the board as to whether the employee is to be retained, immediately discharged, discharged upon termination of the current contract or reemployed at the end of the contract term under a continued probationary status. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 67 - 2344 and 67 - 2345, Idaho Code, a decision to place certificated personnel on probationary status may be made in executive session and the employee shall not be named in the minutes of the meeting. A record of the decision shall be placed in the employee's personnel file. This procedure shall not preclude recognition of unsatisfactory work at a subsequent evaluation and the establishment of a reasonable period of probation. In all instances, the employee shall be duly notified in writing of the areas of work which are deficient, including the conditions of probation. Each such certificated employee on a category 3 contract shall be given notice, in writing, whether he or she will be reemployed for the next ensuing year. Such notice shall be given by the board of trustees no later than the twenty - fifth day of May of each such year. If the board of trustees has decided not to reemploy the certificated employee, then the notice must contain a statement of reasons for such decision and the employee shall, upon request, be given the opportunity for an informal review of such decision by the board of trustees. The parameters of an informal review shall be determined by the local board B contract is a limited two (2) year contract that may be offered at the sole discretion of the board of trustees for certificated personnel in their fourth or greater year of continuous employment with the same school district. The board of trustees may, at its sole discretion, add an additional year to such a contract upon the expiration of the first year, resulting in a new two (2) year contract. The board of trustees may, at its sole discretion, terminate the second year of a category B contract upon the conclusion of the first year, in the event of a reduction in force. Upon the IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1041 decision by a board of trustees not to reemploy the person employed on a category B contract for the following year, the certificated employee shall be provided a written statement of reasons for non - reemployment by no later than July 1. The employee shall, upon request, be given the opportunity for an informal review of such decision by the board of trustees. The parameters of an informal review shall be determined by the local board. Provided however, that no such decision shall be made until after the completion of the written evaluation required by subsection (4) of this section, unless such decision is being made pursuant to a reduction in force. No property rights shall attach to a category B contract and therefore the employee shall not be entitled to a formal review by the board of trustees of the reasons or decision not to reemploy . (3) School districts hiring an employee who has been on renewable con- tract status as provided in section 33 - 515, Idaho Code, with another Idaho district or has out - of - state experience which would otherwise qualify the certificated employee for renewable contract status in Idaho, shall have the option to immediately grant renewable contract status, or to place the em- ployee on a category 3 annual A or B contract. Such employment on a category 3 contract under the provisions of this subsection may be for one (1), two (2) or three (3) years A certificated instructional employee hired with previous out - of - state experience shall not be eligible to receive a renewable con- tract, but may be offered a category A or B contract, based on the employee's years of experience, including out - of - state years of experience as if such years had been worked in Idaho . (4) There shall be a minimum of two one ( 2 1 ) written evaluation s in each of the annual contract years of employment, and at least one (1) evalua- tion the first portion of which shall be completed before January February 1 of each year , and shall include input from parents and guardians of students as a factor . The provisions of this subsection (4) shall not apply to employees on a category 1 contract A second portion shall be included for all evaluations conducted after June 30, 2012. This second portion shall comprise at least fifty percent (50%) of the total written evaluation and shall be based on objective measure(s) of growth in student achievement. The requirement to provide at least one (1) written evaluation does not exclude additional evaluations that may be performed. No civil action for money damages shall arise for failure to comply with this subsection . SECTION 3. That Section 33 - 514A, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 514A. ISSUANCE OF LIMITED CONTRACT - - TRANSITION TO CATEGORY 1 A AND B CONTRACT S . After August 1, the board of trustees may exercise the option of employing certified personnel on a one (1) year limited contract, which may also be referred to as a category 1 contract consistent with the provi- sions of section 33 - 514, Idaho Code. Such a contract is specifically offered for the limited duration of the ensuing school year, and no further notice is required by the district to terminate the contract at the conclusion of the contract year (1) Any certificated employee employed pursuant to a category 1 or 2 contract, as defined by sections 33 - 514 and 33 - 514A, Idaho Code, as such sections existed on January 31, 2011, who will be offered an employment contract by the same school district for the ensuing school year, shall be employed pursuant to a category A contract. (2) Any certificated employee employed pursuant to a category 3 con- tract, as defined in section 33 - 514, Idaho Code, as such section existed on January 31, 2011, who will be offered an employment contract by the same school district for the ensuing school year, shall be employed pursuant to a category A or B contract, as determined by the board of trustees . 1042 IDAHO SESSION LAWS SECTION 4. That Section 33 - 515, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 515. ISSUANCE OF RENEWABLE CONTRACTS. (1) During the third full year of continuous employment by the same school district, including any specially chartered district, each certificated employee named in subsec- tion (16) of section 33 - 1001, Idaho Code, and each school nurse and school librarian shall be evaluated for a renewable contract and shall, upon having been offered a contract for the next ensuing year, having given notice of acceptance of renewal and upon signing a contract for a fourth full year, be placed on a renewable contract status with said school district subject to the provisions included in this chapter It is the intent of the legislature that after January 31, 2011, no new employment contract between a school district and a certificated employee shall result in the vesting of tenure, continued expectations of employment or property rights in an employment relationship. Therefore, no board of trustees shall have the authority to enter into any renewable contract with any certificated or other employee hired by such district, except as specifically addressed by this section and section 33 - 514(3), Idaho Code. For any certificated employees already holding renewable contract status with a district as of January 31, 2011, the provisions of this section shall apply . (2) After the third full year of employment and a A t least once annually, the performance of each such certificated employee , school nurse, or school librarian employed pursuant to a grandfathered renewable contract shall be evaluated according to criteria and procedures established by the board of trustees in accordance with section 33 - 514(4), Idaho Code, and general guidelines approved by the state board of education. Except as otherwise provided, that person the employee employed pursuant to a grandfathered re- newable contract shall have the right to the continued automatic renewal of that employee's employment contract by giving notice, in writing, of accep- tance of renewal. Such notice shall be given to the board of trustees of the school district then employing such person not later than the first twentieth day of June preceding the expiration of the term of the current contract July . Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, the board of trustees shall notify each person entitled to be employed on a grandfathered renewable con- tract of the requirement that such person must give the notice hereinabove and that failure to do so may be interpreted by the board as a declination of the right to automatic renewal or the offer of another contract. Such notification shall be made, in writing, not later than the fifteenth first day of May July , in each year, except to those persons to whom the board, prior to said date, has sent proposed contracts for the next ensuing year, or to whom the board has given the notice required by this section. These deadlines may not be altered by contract, including any currently existing or future negotiated agreement or master contract entered into pursuant to the professional negotiations act, sections 33 - 1271 through 33 - 1276, Idaho Code. Should any existing negotiated agreement or master contract contain such a provision as of January 31, 2011, such provision is declared to be null and void and of no force and effect as of January 31, 2011. (3) Any contract automatically renewed under the provisions of this section shall be for the same length as the term stated in the current contract and at a salary no lower than that specified therein, to which shall be added such increments as may be determined by the statutory or regulatory rights of such employee by reason of training, service, or performance, except where a board of trustees has declared a financial emergency pursuant to section 33 - 522, Idaho Code may be renewed for a shorter term, longer term or the same length of term as the length of term stated in the current contract, and at a greater, lesser or equal salary to that stated in the current contract. IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1043 (4) Should the board of trustees determine to reassign an administra- tive employee who, prior to being employed as an administrative employee was employed pursuant to a renewable contract to a nonadministrative position, the board of trustees, at its discretion, shall employ such nonadministra- tive employee pursuant to a grandfathered renewable contract. Such contract shall be deemed to have continued in place as if the nonadministrative em- ployee was employed by the district pursuant to a renewable contract since January 31, 2011. Such grandfathered renewable contract is subject to the provisions of this section. (a) If the board of trustees reassigns an administrative employee to a nonadministrative position, the board shall give written notice to the employee which contains a statement of the reasons for the reassign- ment. The employee, upon written request to the board, shall be enti- tled to an informal review of that decision. The process and procedure for the informal review shall be determined by the board of trustees . ( 4 b ) Nothing in this section shall prevent the board of trustees from offering a renewed grandfathered renewable contract increasing the salary of any certificated person , or from reassigning an adminis- trative employee to a nonadministrative position with appropriate reduction of salary from the preexisting salary level. In the event the board of trustees reassigns an administrative employee to a nonadminis- trative position, the board shall give written notice to the employee which contains a statement of the reasons for the reassignment. The employee, upon written request to the board, shall be entitled to an informal review of that decision. The process and procedure for the informal review shall be determined by the local board of trustees who is eligible to receive such a contract . (5) Before a board of trustees can determine not to renew for reasons of an the unsatisfactory report of the performance of any certificated per- son whose who holds a grandfathered renewable contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, or to renew the contract of any such person at a re- duced salary , such person shall be entitled to a reasonable period of proba- tion lasting at least six (6) instructional weeks, following an observation, evaluation or partial evaluation . This period of probation shall be pre- ceded by a written notice from the board of trustees or its designee with rea- sons for such probationary period and with provisions for adequate supervi- sion and evaluation of the person's performance during the probationary pe- riod. Such period of probation shall not affect the person's grandfathered renewable contract status. Consideration of probationary status for cer- tificated personnel is consideration of the status of an employee within the meaning of section 67 - 2345, Idaho Code, and the consideration and decision to place an employee on probation may be held in executive session. If the consideration results in probationary status, the individual on probation shall not be named in the minutes of the meeting. A record of the decision shall be placed in the teacher's personnel file. (6) If the board of trustees takes action to immediately discharge or discharge upon termination of the current contract a certificated person whose contract would otherwise be automatically renewed, or to renew the contract of any such person at a reduced salary, the action of the board shall be consistent with the procedures specified in section 33 - 513(5), Idaho Code, and furthermore, the board shall notify the employee in writing whether there is just and reasonable cause not to renew the contract or to reduce the salary of the affected employee, and if so, what reasons it relied upon in that determination. unless the decision to discharge upon termination has been made as part of a reduction in force, or the decision to immediately discharge has been made pursuant to section 33 - 515B, Idaho Code (7) If the board of trustees takes action after the declaration of a financial emergency pursuant to section 33 - 522, Idaho Code, and such action is directed at more than one (1) certificated employee and, if mutually 1044 IDAHO SESSION LAWS agreed to by both parties, a single informal review shall be conducted. Without mutual consent of both parties, the board of trustees shall use the following procedure to conduct a single due process hearing within sixty - seven (67) days of the declaration of financial emergency pursuant to section 33 - 522(2), Idaho Code, or on or before June 22, whichever shall occur first: (a) The superintendent or any other duly authorized administrative of- ficer of the school district may recommend the change in the length of the term stated in the current contract or reduce the salary of any cer- tificated employee by filing with the board of trustees written notice specifying the purported reasons for such changes. (b) Upon receipt of such notice, the board of trustees, acting through its duly authorized administrative official, shall give the affected employees written notice of the reductions and the recommendation of the change in the length of the term stated in the current contract or the reduction of salary, along with written notice of a hearing before the board of trustees prior to any determination by the board of trustees. (c) The hearing shall be scheduled to take place not less than six (6) days nor more than fourteen (14) days after receipt of the notice by the employees. The date provided for the hearing may be changed by mutual consent. (d) The hearing shall be open to the public. (e) All testimony at the hearing shall be given under oath or affirma- tion. Any member of the board, or the clerk of the board of trustees, may administer oaths to witnesses or affirmations by witnesses.

(g) The chairman of the board of trustees or the designee of the chair- man shall conduct the hearing. (h) The board of trustees shall cause an electronic record of the hear- ing to be made or shall employ a competent reporter to take stenographic or stenotype notes of all the testimony at the hearing. A transcript of the hearing shall be provided at cost by the board of trustees upon re- quest of the employee. (i) At the hearing the superintendent or other duly authorized admin- istrative officer shall present evidence to substantiate the reduction contained in such notice. (j) The employees may produce evidence to refute the reduction. Any witness presented by the superintendent or by the employees shall be subject to cross - examination. The board of trustees may also examine witnesses and be represented by counsel. (k) The affected employees may file written briefs and arguments with the board of trustees within three (3) days after the close of the hear- ing or such other time as may be agreed upon by the affected employees and the board of trustees. (l) Within seven (7) days following the close of the hearing, the board of trustees shall determine and, acting through its duly authorized ad- ministrative official, shall notify the employees in writing whether the evidence presented at the hearing established the need for the ac- tion taken. The due process hearing pursuant to this subsection (7) shall not be required if the board of trustees and the local education association reach an agree- ment on issues agreed upon pursuant to section 33 - 522(3), Idaho Code unless the decision to discharge upon termination has been made as part of a reduc- tion in force, or the decision to immediately discharge has been made pur- suant to section 33 - 515B, Idaho Code. ( 8 7 ) If the board of trustees , for reasons other than unsatisfactory service, for the ensuing contract year, determines to change the length of IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1045 the term stated in the current contract , or reduce the salary or not renew the contract of a certificated person whose contract would otherwise be is being automatically renewed, nothing herein shall require a ny due process proceedings or probationary period.

The enrollment figures used for such calculations shall be the same as those used for the calculation of emergency levies pursuant to section 33 - 805, Idaho Code. (2) The school district shall notify those employees whose contracts are being terminated by no later than October 1. Such termination shall be effective as of a date specified by the board of trustees, but shall be no 1046 IDAHO SESSION LAWS earlier than two (2) weeks after the date that the employee received notifi- cation, and no later than the end of the current term.

(2) If the state department of education certifies that one (1) or more of the conditions in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subsection are met, then the board of trustees may declare a financial emergency if it determines that the condition in paragraph (f) of this subsection is also met. Alterna- tively, the board of trustees may declare a financial emergency if it deter- mines that either of the conditions in paragraph (d) or (e) of this subsec- tion are met and the state department of education certifies that the condi- tion set forth in paragraph (f) of this subsection is also met.

(e) The school district's general fund has decreased by at least three percent (3%) from the previous year's level due to a decrease in funding or natural disaster, but not as a result of a drop in the number of support units or the index multiplier calculated pursuant to section 33 - 1004A, Idaho Code, or a change in the emergency levy. (f) The school district's unrestricted general fund balance, which ex- cludes funds restricted by state or federal law and considering both an- ticipated expenditures and revenue, is less than five and one - half per- cent (5 1/2%) of the school district's unrestricted general fund budget at the time the financial emergency is declared or for the fiscal year for which the financial emergency is declared.

PRINCIPALS TO DETERMINE NEW STAFFING. The legislature finds that in order to fairly evaluate the performance of principals based on the growth in student performance at their schools, it is necessary to grant them more control over the hiring and assignment of certificated employees to their schools. To this end, no certificated employee shall be transferred to a principal's school without the principal's permission, unless the transfer is being made due to shifting student population levels, nor shall a certificated individual who the board of trustees wishes to hire be assigned to the principal's school without the principal's permission. As a consequence of this requirement, no new certificated individual shall be considered hired, nor shall a contract be issued to such individual, until a principal has given permission for the assignment to their school. In the case of a transfer that is being made due to shifting student population levels, the principal shall be provided with a choice of at least two (2) individuals to be transferred for each position to be filled, unless there is only one (1) individual whose certificates or endorsements qualify them for the position. For the purposes of this section, the term \"principal\" also means the head of school of a public charter school. SECTION 11. That Chapter 5, Title 33, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION , to be known and des- ignated as Section 33 - 524, Idaho Code, and to read as follows: 33 - 524. LIABILITY INSURANCE. The legislature finds and declares: (1) Educators make decisions everyday that may affect their families' financial future and therefore finds a need for educators to have accessible information about providers of professional liability insurance for educa- tors. (2) School districts seek to protect their employees from harmful li- ability and are also in the best position to inform employees about protec- tions available to them. (3) All employees of a school district shall be informed of all of their options in regards to professional liability insurance for educators. To that end school districts shall disclose to all employees a professional li- ability insurance for educators provider list. Districts shall encourage IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1049 employees who have interaction with students to have such insurance although no employee is required to carry such insurance. (4) School districts shall create a list for such disclosure. Any provider authorized by the state shall be added to the school district's list by request, if the insurance provided is underwritten by a licensed insurance company with an A.M. Best rating of B+ or better. No provider shall be denied if the provider is properly authorized within the state and meets the provisions of this section. (5) Providers are required to submit complete and accurate information regarding their insurance to each school district in the state by June 30 in order for information to be included on the list for the ensuing school year. School districts receiving information regarding insurance after June 30 shall not be required to include the information in the list of insurance options. (6) \"Complete and accurate information\" is defined as name of provider, business mailing address, telephone number and website information. (7) School districts shall provide name of provider, business mailing address, telephone number and website information to all employees. School districts shall not endorse any provider, product or service.

The dis- closure forms shall be held for a period of three (3) years and shall be ac- cessible to the public by request. (9) School districts are required to provide substitute teachers and pre - service teachers with a list of insurance options prior to their first day of teaching in the school district. Substitute teachers and pre - service teachers will be required to sign a form indicating that they have received information about their insurance options. This form shall list the names of insurance providers disclosed to employees. (10) Each school district shall have an updated list available upon re- quest from an employee of that district. School districts may post such in- formation on a staff website or the intranet. (11) For the purposes of this section, \"providers\" refers to any provider of professional liability insurance for educators. \"Employees\" refers to all certificated and noncertificated staff in a school district. \"List\" refers to the document containing a description of all providers offering professional liability insurance for educators to employees of the school district. \"Form\" refers to a document to be signed by school district employees who acknowledge such disclosure.

When this provision is applied, the decrease in average daily attendance shall be 1050 IDAHO SESSION LAWS proportionately distributed among the various categories of support units that are appropriate for the district. (2) Application of Support Program to Separate Schools/Attendance Units in District.

(b) When boundaries of districts are changed by excision or annexation of territory, the support program of any district from which territory is excised for the last year of operation before such excision shall be divided, and apportioned among the districts involved, as prescribed in subsection (4) paragraph (a) of this sub section. (c) In new districts formed by consolidation of former districts after January 1, 2007, the support program allowance , for a seven (7) year pe- riod following the formation of the new district, shall not be less than the combined support program allowances of the component districts in the last year of operation before consolidation. After the expiration of this period, the state department of education shall annually cal- culate the number of support units that would have been generated had the previous school districts not consolidated. All applicable state funding to the consolidated district shall then be provided based on a support unit number that is halfway between this figure and the actual support units, provided that it cannot be less than the actual support units.

EXISTING AGREEMENTS. The legislature finds the inclusion of evergreen or continuation clauses in master contracts or negotiated agreements to be against the public policy of the state of Idaho. Such clauses purport to bind in perpetuity the actions of future elected boards of trustees, subvert the ability of the people to direct their own affairs through the free election of trustees, and are contrary to the tenets of a free republic. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature that any master contract or negotiated agreement, by any name or title, existing as a result of negotiations between a board of trustees and a local education organization shall be subject to the terms of this act, regardless of any evergreen or continuation clause included in such contract or agreement.

Such distributions made pursuant to subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section shall be made according to the allocations established in subsection (1)(b) of this section. (d) The provision in subsection (1)(c) of this section that directs that fifty percent (50%) of certain moneys be distributed pursuant to subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section shall be effective until such time as fifteen percent (15%) of the total moneys appropriated for certificated staff salaries are being distributed pursuant to this section.

Such distributions made pursuant to subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section shall be made according to the allocations established in subsection (1)(b) of this section. 1060 IDAHO SESSION LAWS (e) For the purposes of this subsection, the term \"statewide support units\" shall mean the total number of support units calculated for the purposes of distributing salary - based apportionment in the current fiscal year. (f) In the event of a reduction in the moneys appropriated for certifi- cated staff salaries, the calculations established pursuant to subsec- tions (1)(b) through (d) of this section shall be performed in reverse. (2) Share - based pay for performance bonuses for student achievement growth and excellence. (a) Certificated employees shall be awarded state shares based on the performance of whole schools. (i) Growth - - Utilizing a state longitudinal data system for students, the state department of education shall develop a sys- tem for measuring individual student growth. Such system shall compare spring student scores on the state - mandated summative achievement tests (\"spring test\") from one year to the next, and establish percentile rankings for individual student growth by comparing students with an identical spring test score in the previous year with each other in the current year. A separate growth percentile shall be established for each student for each subject in which the spring test is given in consecutive grades. The median student growth percentile, based on measuring all eligible students, shall be the growth score for each school. All certificated employees at a school with a median growth score in the following ranked quartiles shall be awarded state shares as follows: Instructional Administrative 1st Highest Quartile 1.00 shares 2.00 shares 2nd Highest Quartile 0.50 shares 1.00 shares 3rd Highest Quartile 0.25 shares 0.50 shares 4th Highest Quartile 0.00 shares 0.00 shares (ii) Excellence - - The state department of education shall de- velop a system for comparing and ranking school spring test scores based on standardized scores, utilizing all grades and subjects tested.

No certificated ad- ministrative employee shall receive more than two (2.00) shares, the results of the quartile award tables for growth and excellence notwithstanding. (iv) Students whose spring test results are excluded from the school's results for federal accountability purposes shall be ex- cluded from school growth and excellence calculations. (v) For schools that do not administer the spring test, or for which no spring test growth calculation is possible, the school IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1061 and its certificated employees shall be included with the school to which the students matriculate. (vi) For certificated employees assigned more than one (1) school, state shares shall be earned pro rata, based on the per- centage of the employee's time assigned to each school at the time that students take their spring tests. In addition, for part - time employees, state shares shall be earned pro rata, based on such employee's full - time equivalency status. (vii) The number of schools in each quartile shall be based on the number of certificated employees employed at the schools, with as close to twenty - five percent (25%) of such employees falling within each quartile as possible. (viii) For certificated employees not assigned to a specific school, all new employment contracts signed on or after July 1, 2011, shall provide that at least five percent (5%) of the total available compensation be based on growth in student achievement, as determined by the board of trustees. Such percentage shall increase to ten percent (10%) of the total available compensation for contracts signed on or after July 1, 2015, and fifteen percent (15%) for contracts signed on or after July 1, 2019. (b) Local shares shall be awarded to certificated employees based on performance. Each board of trustees shall develop a plan for awarding local pay for performance shares in consultation with certificated employees. Local share awards to certificated instructional employees shall be based on the performance of groups of such employees, unless there is only one (1) such employee in the school district. No employee shall receive more than one (1.00) local share. For part - time employ- ees, local shares shall be earned pro rata, based on such employee's full - time equivalency status. Local share awards shall be based on one (1) or more of the following measures: (i) Student test scores; (ii) Student graduation rate; (iii) Student dropout rate; (iv) Percent of graduates attending postsecondary education or entering military service; (v) Making federally approved adequate yearly progress; (vi) Number of students successfully completing dual credit or advanced placement classes; (vii) Percent of students involved in extracurricular activi- ties; (viii) Class projects; (ix) Portfolios; (x) special student assignments; (xi) Parental involvement; (xii) Teacher - assigned grades; and (xiii) Student attendance rate. For any school district in which the board of trustees fails to adopt a plan for awarding local pay for performance shares by September 1, local shares awarded for performance in that school year shall be identical to the number of state shares awarded for each certificated employee. (c) Individual pay for performance bonuses shall be calculated as fol- lows: (i) Divide the moneys available for pay for performance bonuses by the total number of state shares earned by certificated employ- ees statewide. (ii) To determine the amount of pay for performance bonus funds to distribute to each school district, multiply the result of subparagraph (i) of this subsection by the number of state shares earned by certificated employees in the school district. 1062 IDAHO SESSION LAWS (iii) To establish the value of a share in each school district, the school district shall divide the funds distributed by the state department of education pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this subsection by the total number of state and local shares earned by all certificated employees who earned at least a frac- tion of both a state and local share. (iv) Multiply the total number of state and local shares earned by each certificated employee of the school district who earned at least a fraction of a state and local share by the result of sub- paragraph (iii) of this subsection. Certificated employees who do not earn at least a fraction of both a state and local share shall not be eligible to receive a pay for performance bonus. Pay for performance bonuses shall be paid by school districts to qualify- ing certificated employees in a lump sum by no later than December 15 following the spring test of the prior school year. (3) Hard to fill position bonuses. (a) The state board of education shall designate certificates and endorsements held by certificated instructional staff for hard to fill position bonuses. The board shall rank the certificates or endorse- ments to be so designated based on the relative difficulty of school districts' ability to recruit and retain such personnel. No additional certificates or endorsements may be added to the rankings beyond the first such certificate or endorsement that causes the number of cer- tificates or endorsements to equal or exceed one - third (1/3) of the total certificates and endorsements held by certificated instructional public school employees in the state. The board shall review and alter such rankings and designations at least once every two (2) years based on market conditions. Any changes in rankings and designations shall be made by the board by no later than March 31 of the previous school year, and school districts shall be promptly notified of any changes. (b) School district boards of trustees may choose to designate certifi- cates and endorsements held by certificated instructional employees for hard to fill position bonuses, provided such certificates and endorsements have been so designated by the state board of education as provided in subsection (3)(a) of this section. School boards of trustees choosing to make such designations shall rank the certificates and endorsements based on the relative difficulty of recruiting and retaining such personnel. No additional certificates or endorsements may be added to the rankings beyond the first such certificate or en- dorsement that causes the number of the district's full - time equivalent employees utilizing such certificates and endorsements to equal or exceed ten percent (10%) of the certificated instructional positions employed by the district; provided however, the number of such employ- ees who may be designated shall not be less than one (1). The amount distributed for utilization by each district shall be based on each district's share of the total certificated instructional employees statewide. Funds so distributed shall be paid solely to certificated instructional personnel holding the certifications and endorsements designated by the local school board, in amounts that shall be deter- mined at the discretion of the local board, which may vary between, but not within, individual certificate and endorsement areas; provided however, no award shall exceed twice the statewide average bonus paid per certificated instructional employee pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. (c) School districts may apply to the state board of education to waive the requirement that a certificate or endorsement designated by the school district for hard to fill position bonuses first be designated for such by the state board of education. The state board of education may grant such a waiver for good and rational cause. IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1063 (d) In order to receive a hard to fill position bonus, an individual must actually be providing instruction or service within the designated certificate or endorsement area. (e) If an individual qualifies for a hard to fill position bonus in more than one (1) certificate or endorsement, the individual shall be allo- cated and paid on a full - time equivalency basis, based on the relative time spent in each of the qualifying areas. (f) School district boards of trustees choosing to utilize hard to fill position bonus funds shall designate a new list of certificates and en- dorsements for such bonuses for each school year by no later than June 11 of the previous school year. The new list may be identical to the list from the previous school year, subject to the current ten percent (10%) limitation requirements. (g) If the board of trustees determines that it will be unable to attract a qualified candidate to serve in a hard to fill position, even with the addition of such bonus funds, the board may use such funds to pay for the training and coursework needed by a currently unqualified employee or other individual to gain such qualification. If such payment is authorized, the amount paid for an individual in a fiscal year shall not exceed twice the statewide average bonus paid per certificated instructional employee pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. The individual for whom training and coursework is paid in such manner must earn a passing grade for the training and coursework that is paid by the school district and must work for the school district at least one (1) year in the designated certificate or endorsement area for each fiscal year in which the school district made payments for training and coursework, or repay the funds. (h) Hard to fill position bonuses shall be paid by school districts to qualifying certificated instructional employees by no later than De- cember 15, in a lump sum payment. (4) Leadership awards. (a) School district boards of trustees may designate up to twenty - five percent (25%) of their certificated instructional employees for lead- ership awards. Such awards shall recognize excellence, be valid only for the fiscal year for which the awards are made and require one (1) or more of the following additional duties: (i) Teacher or other instructional staff mentoring; (ii) Content leadership; (iii) Lead teacher; (iv) Peer teaching coach; (v) Content (vi) Remedial (vii) Curriculum development course; on local/state/national education committee or task force; (xv) Providing leadership to a professional learning community; and (xvi) Earning national board certification. Duties related to student activities and athletics shall not be eligi- ble for leadership awards. (b) Local school district boards of trustees shall require that the em- ployee work additional time as a condition of the receipt of a leader- ship award. 1064 IDAHO SESSION LAWS (c) Local school district boards of trustees may grant multiple lead- ership awards with multiple additional duties. No employee, however, shall receive leadership awards in excess of twice the statewide aver- age bonus paid per certificated instructional employee pursuant to sub- section (2) of this section. (d) Leadership awards shall be paid by school districts to qualifying certificated instructional employees in a lump sum payment upon comple- tion of the additional duty. (e) Employees with fewer than three (3) years of experience shall not be eligible for leadership awards. The term \"experience\" shall be as used for certificated instructional staff in section 33 - 1004A, Idaho Code. (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (4)(a) through (e) of this section, employees who earned national board certification prior to July 1, 2011, and who are no longer receiving payments for earning such certification pursuant to section 33 - 1004E, Idaho Code, due to the repeal of the provision providing for such payments, shall be paid two thousand dollars ($2,000) per year from the moneys allocated pursuant to this subsection (4) until all moneys that would have been paid un- der the previous provisions of section 33 - 1004E, Idaho Code, have been paid. (5) School districts may shift moneys between the allocations for subsections (3) and (4) of this section. The ten percent (10%) limitation established in subsection (3) of this section and the twenty - five percent (25%) limitation established in subsection (4) of this section shall be adjusted accordingly. (6) All distributions of moneys to school districts shall be made as part of the third payment to school districts required by section 33 - 1009, Idaho Code. (7) School districts shall not enter into any contract that discrimi- nates against those receiving a bonus award pursuant to this section. (8) The state department of education may require reports of informa- tion as needed to implement the provisions of this section and provide re- ports to the governor, the legislature and the public. (9) For the purposes of this section, the term \"school district\" also means \"public charter school,\" and the term \"board of trustees\" also means \"board of directors.\" SECTION 28. Nothing in this act shall prevent the Legislature from adjusting any component of any public school funding formula in any fis- cal year, pursuant to the needs of public schools and the constitutional requirement that the state of Idaho maintain a balanced budget. SECTION 29. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this act are hereby de- clared to be severable and if any provision of this act or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this act.

That Chapter 10, Title 33, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION , to be known and des- ignated as Section 33 - 1002A, Idaho Code, and to read as follows: 33 - 1002A. FRACTIONAL AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. (1) For students at- tending school in more than one (1) school district or public charter school, or who are enrolled in one (1) or more online courses in which the student's home school district or public charter school is not the content provider, attendance shall be counted and divided based on the portion of the student's daily attendance time that is spent in attendance at each school district, public charter school or online course. This provision shall not apply to: (a) An online course in which the school district or public charter school has a contract in place for the provision of online courses. (b) Any online course which causes the total number of courses in which a student is enrolled to exceed the maximum number of periods of instruction offered at the school in which the student is enrolled. If a student is enrolled in multiple online courses and one (1) or more online course falls within this limitation and one (1) or more fall beyond it, then the most expensive courses shall be subject to frac- tional average daily attendance. School districts and public charter schools may choose to pay for any online courses that fall beyond the limitation of this paragraph, at their discretion. The parents or guardians of students shall be responsible for paying the cost of any online courses in which the student is enrolled beyond the limitation of this paragraph, unless such cost has been paid by the student's school district or public charter school. A student's home school district or public charter school shall notify the student's parent or guardian at the time of registration if any online courses in which the student is enrolling exceed the maximum provided in this paragraph. (2) For online courses subject to fractional counting and division, the average daily attendance shall be counted and funded as part of the student's home school district or public charter school attendance. However, the state department of education shall identify the fraction attributable to such attendance for each student and furnish the home school district or public charter school with a dollar amount of funding attributable to each such fraction. The home school district or public charter school shall then remit two - thirds (2/3) of such amount to each online course content provider. (3) For the purposes of this section and section 33 - 1627, Idaho Code, the term \"online course\" means a course which delivers a sequential program of synchronous and/or asynchronous instruction primarily through the use of technology, in which the instructor is not physically located at the school or place in which the student is receiving instruction. Nothing in this def- inition shall prohibit a blended course that includes face - to - face, in per- son instruction, provided that a majority of the instruction is delivered as stated herein. SECTION 37. That Section 33 - 1004, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 1004. STAFF ALLOWANCE. For each school district, a staff allowance shall be determined as follows: (1) Using the daily attendance reports that have been submitted for computing the February 15 apportionment of state funds as provided in sec- tion 33 - 1009, Idaho Code, determine the total support units for the district in the manner provided in section 33 - 1002(6)(a), Idaho Code; (2) Determine the instructional staff allowance by multiplying the support units by 1.1. A district must demonstrate that it actually employs the number of certificated instructional staff allowed, except as provided IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1077 in subsection (5)(f) , and (g) and (h) of this section. If the district does not employ the number allowed, the staff allowance shall be reduced to the actual number employed, except as provided in subsection (5)(f) , and (g) and (h) of this section; (3) Determine the administrative staff allowance by multiplying the support units by .075; (4) Determine the classified staff allowance by multiplying the sup- port units by .375; (5) Additional conditions governing staff allowance: (a) In determining the number of staff in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section, a district may contract separately for services to be rendered by nondistrict employees and such employees may be counted in the staff allowance. A \"nondistrict employee\" means a person for whom the school district does not pay the employer's obligations for employee benefits. When a district contracts for the services of a nondistrict employee, only the salary portion of the contract shall be allowable for computations. (b) If there are circumstances preventing eligible use of staff al- lowance to which a district is entitled as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, an appeal may be filed with the state department of education outlining the reasons and proposed alternative use of these funds, and a waiver may be granted. (c) For any district with less than forty (40) support units: (i) The instructional staff allowance shall be calculated applying the actual number of support units. If the actual in- structional staff employed in the school year is greater than the instructional staff allowance, then the instructional staff allowance shall be increased by one - half (1/2) staff allowance; and (ii) The administrative staff allowance shall be calculated ap- plying the actual number of support units. If the actual adminis- trative staff employed in the school year is greater than the ad- ministrative staff allowance, then the administrative staff al- lowance shall be increased by one - half (1/2) staff allowance. (iii) Additionally, for any district with less than twenty (20) support units, the instructional staff allowance shall be calcu- lated applying the actual number of support units. If the number of instructional staff employed in the school year is greater than the instructional staff allowance, the staff allowance shall be increased as provided in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsec- tion, and by an additional one - half (1/2) instructional staff al- lowance. (d) For any school district with one (1) or more separate secondary schools serving grades nine (9) through twelve (12), the instructional staff allowance shall be increased by two (2) additional instructional staff allowances for each such separate secondary school. (e) Only instructional, administrative and classified personnel compensated by the school district from the general maintenance and operation fund of the district shall be included in the calculation of staff allowance or in any other calculations based upon staff, in- cluding determination of the experience and education multiplier, the reporting requirements, or the district's salary - based apportionment calculation. No food service staff or transportation staff shall be included in the staff allowance. (f) A district may utilize up to five fifteen percent ( 1 5%) of the mon- eys associated with positions funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to pay another school district or public charter school for in- structional services or to defray the cost of providing virtual educa- 1078 IDAHO SESSION LAWS tion coursework, including virtual dual credit coursework, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed. (g) For the period July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2011, only, a district may shift up to five percent (5%) of the positions funded pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to federal funds, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed. (h) A district may employ fewer positions than funded pursuant to sub- section (2) of this section, without a reduction in the number of funded positions being imposed, subject to the following limits on the percent of such positions that may be reduced: Fiscal Year Percentage 2012 6% 2013 8% 2014 and each fiscal year thereafter 10% (6) In the event that the staff allowance in any category is insuffi- cient to meet accreditation standards, a district may appeal to the state board of education, demonstrating the insufficiency, and the state board may grant a waiver authorizing sufficient additional staff to be included within the staff allowance to meet accreditation standards.

That Section 33 - 1004A, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 1004A. EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION MULTIPLIER. Each instructional and administrative staff position shall be assigned an appropriate multi- plier based upon the following table: EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION MA MA + 12 MA + 24 MA + 36 Years BA BA + 12 BA + 24 BA + 36 BA + 48 BA + 60 ES/DR 2.01260 In determining the experience factor, the actual years of teaching or administrative service in a public school, in an accredited private or parochial school, or beginning in the 2005 - 06 school year and thereafter IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1079 in an accredited college or university shall be credited, minus two (2); provided however, that the experience factor cannot be less than zero (0). In determining the education factor, only credits earned after initial certification, based upon a transcript on file with the teacher certifica- tion office of the state department of education, earned at an institution of higher education accredited by the state board of education or a regional ac- crediting association, shall be allowed. Provided however, that successful completion of a state - approved mathematical thinking for instruction course shall be counted as transcripted credit. Instructional staff whose initial certificate is an occupational specialist certificate shall be treated as BA degree prepared instructional staff. Credits earned by such occupational specialist instructional staff after initial certification shall be cred- ited toward the education factor. For the time period July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, instructional and administrative staff shall not advance on the education portion of the multiplier table. In determining the statewide average multiplier for instructional staff, no multiplier in excess of 1.59092 shall be used. If the actual statewide average multiplier for instructional staff, as determined by this section, exceeds 1.59092, then each school district's instructional staff multiplier shall be multiplied by the result of 1.59092 divided by the actual statewide average multiplier for instructional staff. In determining the statewide average multiplier for administrative staff, no multiplier in excess of 1.86643 shall be used. If the actual statewide average multiplier for administrative staff, as determined by this section, exceeds 1.86643, then each school district's administrative staff multiplier shall be multiplied by the result of 1.86643 divided by the actual statewide average multiplier for administrative staff. SECTION 39. That Section 33 - 1004E, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 1004E. DISTRICT'S SALARY - BASED APPORTIONMENT. Each district shall be entitled to a salary - based apportionment calculated as provided in this section. 1. To determine the apportionment for instructional staff, first determine the district average experience and education index by placing all eligible district certificated instructional employees on the statewide index provided in section 33 - 1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting average is the district index. Districts with an index above the state average index shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .03 for the 1994 - 95 school year, and shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .06 for the 1995 - 96 school year, and thereafter shall receive their actual district index. The district instructional staff index shall be multiplied by the instructional base salary of $23,565. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for instructional staff determined as provided in section 33 - 1004(2), Idaho Code. The instructional salary allocation shall be further increased by the amount necessary for each full - time equivalent instructional staff member placed on the experience and education index to be allocated at least the minimum salary mandated by this section. Full - time instructional staff salaries shall be determined from a salary schedule developed by each district and submitted to the state department of education. No full - time instructional staff member shall be paid less than $ 29,655 30,000 . If an instructional staff member has been certified by the national board for professional teaching standards, the staff member shall be designated as a master teacher and receive $2,000 per year for five (5) years. The instructional salary shall be increased by $2,000 for each master teacher provided however, that no such awards shall be paid for the period July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, nor shall any liabilities accrue or payments 1080 IDAHO SESSION LAWS be made pursuant to this section in the future to any individuals who would have otherwise qualified for a payment during this stated time period. The resulting amount is the district's salary - based apportionment for instructional staff. For purposes of this section, teachers qualifying for the salary increase as master teacher shall be those who have been recognized as national board certified teachers as of July 1 of each year After the base and minimum salaries established pursuant to this subsection have reached the amounts that were in effect in fiscal year 2009, all further increases to these base and minimum salaries shall be allocated such that the percentage increase in the minimum salary is one and one - half (1.5) times the percentage increase in the base salary . 2. To determine the apportionment for district administrative staff, first determine the district average experience and education index by placing all eligible certificated administrative employees on the statewide index provided in section 33 - 1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting average is the district index. Districts with an index above the state average index shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .03 for the school year 1994 - 95, and shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average index plus .06 for the 1995 - 96 school year, and thereafter shall receive their actual district index. The district adminis- trative staff index shall be multiplied by the base salary of $32,441. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for administrative staff determined as provided in section 33 - 1004(3), Idaho Code. The resulting amount is the district's salary - based apportionment for administrative staff. 3. To determine the apportionment for classified staff, multiply $19,041 by the district classified staff allowance determined as provided in section 33 - 1004(4), Idaho Code. The amount so determined is the district's apportionment for classified staff. 4. The district's salary - based apportionment shall be the sum of the apportionments calculated in subsections 1., 2. and 3., of this section, adjusted by the following percentages: Fiscal Year Percentage 2012 (1.67%) 2013 (4.05%) 2014 (6.30%) 2015 (6.42%) 2016 (6.21%) 2017 and each fiscal year thereafter (5.74%) plus the benefit apportionment as provided in section 33 - 1004F, Idaho Code. SECTION 40. That Section 33 - 1004F, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 1004F. OBLIGATIONS TO RETIREMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. 1. Based upon the actual salary - based apportionment, as determined in section 33 - 1004E, Idaho Code, plus distributions made pursuant to section 33 - 1004I, Idaho Code, there shall be allocated that amount required to meet the em- ployer's obligations to the public employee retirement system and to social security. 2. If a district's qualifying salaries total more than the district's salary - based apportionment, there shall be allocated an additional amount to meet the employer's obligation to the public employee retirement system and to social security equal to two - thirds (2/3) of the additional obliga- tion for the school year 1994 - 95. If a district's qualifying salaries total IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1081 more than the district's salary - based apportionment, there shall be allo- cated an additional amount to meet the employer's obligation to the public employee retirement system and to social security equal to one - third (1/3) of the additional obligation for the school year 1995 - 96. Thereafter, the benefit allocation shall be based solely upon the provisions of subsection 1. of this section. SECTION 41. That Section 33 - 1020, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33 - 1020. IDAHO DIGITAL LEARNING ACADEMY FUNDING. Of the moneys appro- priated for the educational support program, an amount shall be distributed to support the Idaho digital learning academy, created pursuant to chapter 55, title 33, Idaho Code. For the purposes of this section, an \"enrollment\" shall be counted each time an Idaho school age child enrolls in an Idaho dig- ital learning academy class. A single child enrolled in multiple classes shall count as multiple enrollments. Summer enrollments shall be included in the fiscal year that begins that summer. The amount distributed shall be calculated as follows: (1) A fixed base amount shall be distributed, equal to the current fis- cal year's statewide average salary - based apportionment funding per midterm support unit, multiplied by seven (7). (2) A variable base amount shall be distributed each time the number of enrollments meets or exceeds an increment of five thousand (5,000). The amount so distributed shall be equal to the number of such increments, mul- tiplied by the current fiscal year's statewide average salary - based appor- tionment funding per midterm support unit, multiplied by four and thirty - three hundredths (4.33). (3) A variable amount shall be distributed, equal to the number of en- rollments multiplied by the current fiscal year's statewide average salary - based apportionment funding per midterm support unit, divided by one hundred forty - three (143). If the revenue received by the Idaho digital learning academy pursuant to this section, section 33 - 1002A, Idaho Code, and any contracts with school districts or public charter schools, is less than $3,500,000 in fiscal year 2013 or fiscal year 2014, then the moneys distributed to the Idaho digital learning academy pursuant to this section shall be increased by the amount necessary to ensure that the total dollars received by the Idaho digital learning academy from all such sources is equal to $3,500,000 for each of the stated fiscal years. The state department of education shall make an estimated distribution of funds to the Idaho digital learning academy by no later than July 31 of each fiscal year, consisting of eighty percent (80%) of the estimated funding for the fiscal year. The balance of all remaining funds to be dis- tributed, pursuant to the calculations in this section, shall be distributed by no later than May 15 of the same fiscal year. SECTION 42. That Chapter 10, Title 33, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION , to be known and des- ignated as Section 33 - 1021, Idaho Code, and to read as follows: 33 - 1021. MATH AND SCIENCE REQUIREMENT. In order to meet state gradua- tion requirements regarding math and science courses, moneys shall be dis- tributed to school districts to defray the cost of providing additional math and science courses. Moneys so distributed shall be used to hire additional high school math and science teachers or to defray costs associated with pro- viding math and science courses to high school students. Moneys shall be distributed to school districts from the moneys appropriated to the educa- 1082 IDAHO SESSION LAWS tional support program for each regular high school, not including alterna- tive schools, based on the following criteria: (1) For each school with enrollment of 99 or less, distribute the equiv- alent of one ninth (1/9) of a classified staff position. (2) For each school with enrollment of 100 to 159, distribute the equiv- alent of one and one - quarter (1.25) of a classified staff position. (3) For each school with enrollment of 160 to 319, distribute the equiv- alent of two sevenths (2/7) of a classified staff position. (4) For each school with enrollment of 320 to 639, distribute the equiv- alent of one (1.0) instructional staff position, based on the statewide av- erage funding per position. (5) For each school with enrollment of 640 or more, distribute the equivalent of one (1.0) instructional staff position, based on the statewide average funding per position, and three - quarters (0.75) of a classified staff position. For the purposes of these school size classifications for regular high schools that serve only grades 10 - 12, ninth grade students who will attend the regular high school upon matriculating to tenth grade shall be included as enrolled in the regular high school.

The loss of these high value, national priority nuclear research missions to other IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1111 states would not only seriously endanger the future of the INL but, by exten- sion, Idaho's economic interests; and WHEREAS, based on these findings, LINE I recommended the State of Idaho exercise leadership by forming a standing nuclear advisory council to: (1) ensure the continued vitality of the INL and Idaho's growing nuclear indus- tries sector; and (2) advance the position that in the interests of fiscal responsibility in these trying financial times the public is best served by maximizing use of existing assets, rather than the costly replication of such assets elsewhere; and WHEREAS, in recognition of the outstanding efforts of LINE I, and not wanting to lose valuable institutional knowledge, the standing nuclear council recommendation would be best accomplished through an extension of LINE I - - namely, the establishment of the Governor's Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission 2.0 (LINE II).

Identify and recommend appropriate pre - emptive/preparatory actions relative to looming federal budget and policy decisions that could have negative implications for long - term INL operations, including advising on the propriety of partnering with other states for mutual benefit; d. Identify additional opportunities and investments that can be made in the Center for Advanced Energy Studies, Idaho's universities and general research, transportation and communications infrastructure in furtherance of the mission of the INL; e. Provide a means or mechanism to enable a continued robust and open dialogue with the public on the INL, Idaho's broader nuclear industries sector and Commission activities; and f. Evaluate policy options for strengthening the broader nuclear industries sector in Idaho. 2. The duties of LINE II are solely advisory in nature. 3. The members of LINE II shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Governor. Members will include, but are not limited to: a. A representative from State government; b. A representative from the universities of the State; c. A representative from the Idaho House of Representatives; d. A representative from the Idaho Senate; 1112 IDAHO SESSION LAWS e. A mayor or county commissioner; f. A representative of the current R&D contractor at the INL; g. A representative from a private - sector nuclear industries company; and h. A member of the public. 4.

(7) The expiration date of an allocation of Volume Cap under this Executive Order may be extended upon prior written approval of the Director, provided there are no pending applications for Volume Cap within the same Priority Set Aside, or if there are other such applications pending, that the application for the allocation being extended best demonstrates the need for, and economic impact of, the Program or Project in the State and how the Program or Project will effectively utilize and efficiently distribute resources throughout the State, and provided further that all other provisions of this Executive Order are complied with. (8) In the event that the Director is uncertain whether an application meets the requirements set forth in 4(2) or 4(4) above, he may defer action on such application until he has received another application(s) and then determine which application best meets such criteria. (9) In the case of an application filed prior to the date when the Direc- tor makes an allocation under 4(1)(h) above for an allocation from a Pri- ority Set Aside which provides for a minimum percent of Allocation Dollars and sets forth a specific Issuing Authority to receive the Priority Set Aside [specifically, Priority Set Asides 4(1)(b), 4(1)(d) and 4(1)(e)], the Di- rector may, and, at the request of the Issuing Authority, shall, make an al- location of that Year's Allocation Dollars in an amount not to exceed the minimum percentage stated for the Priority Set Aside prior to the date the Director has set for determination of allocations under 4(1)(h) but in no event later than 15 days after the date such application is filed. Section 5 : (1) Issuing Authorities with Qualifying Carryforward Projects or Programs may apply for an allocation of Allotment Dollars for such Qualifying Carry- forward Projects or Programs by submitting an application to the Director which shall contain: (a) the carryforward purpose for the Bonds under Section 146(f) of the Code; (b) any other information required by Section 146(f) of the Code; (c) a certification signed by both an official of the Issuing Author- ity responsible for the supervision of the issuance of the Bonds and, if applicable, a representative of the person or entity constructing, acquiring, or rehabilitating the Project or administering the Program, stating that the Issuing Authority and, if applicable, such person or entity, will proceed with diligence to ensure the issuance of the Bonds within the carryforward period provided by Section 146(f) of the Code; 1120 IDAHO SESSION LAWS (d) a preliminary opinion from bond counsel that the Project or Program qualifies for carryforward under Section 146(f) of the Code, if appli- cable; (e) if applying for an allocation of Allotment Dollars for the purpose of issuing mortgage credit certificates under Section 25 of the Code, the amount of qualified mortgage bonds defined in Section 143 of the Code which the Issuing Authority elects not to issue under the Code; and (f) such other information and attachments as are set forth in Section 3(1). (2) No application submitted by an Issuing Authority to the Director pur- suant to this section shall be processed if at the time such application is considered the amount of allocation of the Volume Cap requested in such ap- plication is in excess of the amount of the Volume Cap remaining available for allocation. Any application not processed for the reason stated in this subsection may be resubmitted to the Director, with or without a change in the amount of allocation requested. Any application resubmitted to the Di- rector pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as a new application. Should an allocation not be granted for the reasons stated in this subsec- tion, the Director shall continue to process other applications in accor- dance with the provisions of Section 4(4), granting allocations pursuant to the provisions of this Executive Order. (3) Allocations of the Volume Cap for Qualifying Carryforward Projects or Programs shall be granted by the Director in the amount requested by the ap- plying Issuing Authority, if available, on or after December 1, but no later than December 31, of the Year in which an application in satisfactory order is submitted to the Director for an allocation of the Volume Cap for a Qual- ifying Carryforward Project or Program in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(5). The Director shall issue certificates of allocation evidenc- ing the granting of an allocation within the time period specified in the preceding sentence to each Issuing Authority which applied to the Director and which received an allocation of the Volume Cap for a Qualifying Carry- forward Project or Program of such Issuing Authority, such certificates of allocation to be similar to the certificates of allocation described in Sec- tion 4, stating the amount of Allotment Dollars which have been allocated to such Issuing Authority, specifying the Qualifying Carryforward Project or Program for which the allocation has been made and specifying the expiration date of the allocation, as provided by Section 146(f) of the Code. Section 6 : No application submitted to the Director may be amended without the consent of the Director; provided, however, that no such consent shall be required for an Issuing Authority to submit a new application in order to replace a previously submitted application if such new application is sub- mitted before an allocation is made on the basis of the original application; provided further, that the consent of the Director shall not be required for an Issuing Authority to withdraw a previously submitted application. For purposes of receiving an allocation of the Volume Cap, any application that has been amended shall be treated as though such application was submitted on the date that the amendment was made, rather than on the date of the original submission of such application. Section 7 : (1) After the effective date of this Executive Order, any Issuing Author- ity issuing Bonds without a certificate or allocation of the Director issued pursuant to Section 4 or Section 5, as appropriate, evidencing the granting of an allocation for such Bonds or Certificates, or any Issuing Authority is- suing Bonds or Certificates after the expiration of an allocation under Sec- tion 4 or Section 5, as appropriate, is not entitled to any allocation of the Volume Cap for such Bonds or Certificates, and any Issuing Authority issuing Bonds or Certificates in excess of the allocation set forth in the certifi- IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1121 cate of allocation is not entitled to any allocation of the Volume Cap for such excess. (2) Each Issuing Authority shall (a) advise the Director on or before the earlier of the sixtieth day after the issuance of any Bonds or Certificates or December 27 of each Year, of the principal amount of Bonds or Certificates issued under the allocation set forth in each certificate of allocation issued by the Di- rector evidencing the granting of an allocation for such Bonds or Cer- tificates by delivering to the Director a copy of the Form 8038 which was delivered to the Internal Revenue Service in connection with such Bonds or Certificates, or, if no such form was required to be delivered to the Internal Revenue Service, a completed copy of a Form 8038 prepared for the Director with respect to such Bonds or Certificates, or (b) if all or a stated portion of such Bonds or Certificates will not be issued, shall advise the Director in writing, on or before the earlier of (i) the fifteenth day after the earlier of (A) the final decision not to issue all or a stated portion of such Bonds or Certificates or (B) the expiration of the allocation, or (ii) December 27 of the Year in which the allocation for such Bonds or Certificates was made. (3) Each Issuing Authority shall cooperate with the Director in furnishing any information the Director reasonably requires. If an Issuing Authority obtains an allocation of a portion of the Volume Cap for a particular Project or Program from the Director as provided in Section 4 or Section 5, as appro- priate, but does not issue its Bonds or Certificates within the prescribed time limit, or issues a lesser amount of Bonds or Certificates within the prescribed time limit, such Issuing Authority may again submit an applica- tion with respect to the proposed Bonds or Certificates or portion of such Bonds or Certificates not issued for such Project or Program as provided in Section 4 or Section 5, as appropriate. Such application shall be treated as a new application. Section 8 : In addition to the duties otherwise specifically set forth in this Executive Order, the Director shall: (1) determine the amount of Allotment Dollars available on December 28 of each Year for allocation for Qualifying Carryforward Projects or Programs and allocate the Allotment Dollars available for Qualifying Carryforward Projects or Programs as provided in this Executive Order; (2) maintain a record of all applications filed by Issuing Authorities un- der Section 3 and Section 5 and all certificates of allocation issued under Section 4 and Section 5; (3) maintain a record of all Bonds or Certificates issued by Issuing Author- ities during each Year; (4) maintain a record of all information filed by Issuing Authorities under this Executive Order; (5) make available upon reasonable request a certified copy of all or any part of the records maintained by the Department under this Executive Order or a summary thereof including information regarding the Volume Cap for each Year and any amounts available or at any time remaining available, for allo- cation under this Executive Order; (6) the Director shall serve as the State official designated under State law to make any certifications required to be made under the Code including, without limitation, the certification required by Section 149(e)(2)(F) of the Code; and (7) promulgate reasonable rules not inconsistent with this Executive Order deemed necessary or expedient to allocate the Volume Cap hereunder. 1122 IDAHO SESSION LAWS Section 9 : If any provision of this Executive Order shall be held to be, or shall, in fact, be invalid, inoperative or unconstitutional, the defect of the provision shall not affect any other provision of this Executive Order or render it invalid, inoperative, or unenforceable. To the extent this Exec- utive Order shall be held or shall, in fact, be invalid inoperative, or un- constitutional, all allocations of the Volume Cap previously made under this Executive Order shall be treated as allocations made by the Governor of the State in accordance with provisions of the State Law. Section 10 : This Executive Order replaces Executive Order No. 2009 - 02 which is hereby repealed, provided that such replacement shall not affect any al- locations in the State made prior to the effective date hereof pursuant to any other Executive Orders or laws of the State. Section 11 : The State pledges and agrees with the owners of any Bonds or Cer- tificates to which an allocation of the Volume Cap has been granted under this Executive Order that the State will not retroactively alter the allo- cation of the Volume Cap to such Bonds or Certificates. Section 12 : No action taken pursuant to this Executive Order shall be deemed to create an obligation, debt or liability of the State or be deemed to con- stitute an approval of any obligation issued or to be issued hereunder. Section 13 : The purpose of this Executive Order is to maximize the bene- fits of financing and development through the use of Bonds and Certificates providing a system for the implementation and administration of the formula specified in the State Law for allocating the Volume Cap within the meaning of Section 146 of the Code. Section 14 : This Executive Order shall be effective immediately and shall continue in effect until such time as it may be repealed or superseded by operation of State or Federal law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, alloca- tions for Qualifying Carry forward Projects or Programs pursuant to Section 5 hereof shall remain effective for the term of such allocation provided for in Section 146(f) of the Code.
