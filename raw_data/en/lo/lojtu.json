The reports are consolidated in one document and tabled as a separate volume to the current two tabled documents, which cover current and former parliamentarians' travel costs. If a Senator or Member has accessed the entitlement but not submitted a report at the time of preparation of the six monthly document, a page with the name of the Senator or Member and dates of travel will appear in the document with the annotation 'No report received at time of preparation of this document for tabling'. Reports subsequently received will be included in a future tabling. Supporting Information Attachments to reports are often bulky and include a wide range of reference material such as copies of legislation, itineraries and reports prepared by other entities. These will not be included in the tabled report but will be available on written request to the Office of the Special Minister of State. Reports appear in travel date order. This Page Is Intentionally Left Blank 2 SENATOR JUDITH TROETH SENATOR JUDITH TROETH Senator for Victoria JT:jb 24 February 2005 Senator The Hon Eric Abetz Special Minister of State MG 50 Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 Dear Minister, In accordance with the requirements of clause 9.2(b) of Remuneration Tribunal Determination No 14 of 2003, I submit the following statement reporting on my recent overseas study journey. I confirm that the purpose of my travel was to hold meetings relating to AUSAID projects in Vietnam and Cambodia, the pursuit of Free Trade Agreements with Thailand and Malaysia, the effort to combat the trafficking of women and children throughout Asia and the ways in which our world class education system is being promoted to our Asian neighbours. For ease of reconciliation, I will attach the final Synergi Parliamentary travel itinerary to confirm my travel arrangements. VIETNAM \u20143 JANUARY to 7 JANUARY, 2005 Hanoi. A meeting was arranged at the Australian Embassy with Richard Martin who was at that time on secondment to Hanoi from the Department of Education, Science and Training and another meeting was held later that day with former Vietnamese Ambassador, Michael Mann who is now CEO of the RMIT International University Vietnam. The University is the only fully foreign-owned University in Vietnam with campuses in both Hanoi and Hoi Chi Minh City. Although small, its reputation seems to be such that both students and foreign staff are attracted to it. There is an English language program run for students who are planning to study in Australia. Many of the students to whom we spoke wanted to return to their district to run small businesses and assist in the economic development of the country. Unit 1 322332 St Kilda Road St Kilda Vic Tel 026277 3785 Fax 02 6277 5797 I also visited two AUSAID projects whilst in Hanoi. Both were at some distance from the city and showed how relatively small amounts of foreign aid can be used to combat rural poverty and assist otherwise disadvantaged sectors. AusAlD had given a one-off grant of AUS $25,000 to assist disabled children to learn to sew to assist them to earn a living. The other one was a grant of AUS $6,000 which had improved amenities at a small rural primary school by providing flooring for classrooms as well as improved insulation and wiring at the school. A meeting was held with Mr Tim Gauci, Senior Trade Commissioner for AUSTRADE. He presented an optimistic but realistic picture for Australian exports to Vietnam. There are opportunities for expansion, particularly in wool, dairy and live cattle. I was particularly impressed with AUSTRADE's proactive business outlook which must pay dividends in the future. CAMBODIA \u20147 JANUARY to 11 JANUARY, 2005 Phnom Penh. I met with 2 female Cambodian members of Parliament, Lady HE Mrs Sam Kanitha, Senator for the Kingdom of Cambodia and HE Ms Kuon Sodary, MP. Both women had endured the excesses of the P01 Pot regime which had such a devastating effect on Cambodian society. Phnom Penh, although a most attractive city has many fine but derelict buildings as evidence of the regime's occupation. After surviving the war years both women had dedicated themselves to the service of their country. They agreed that without strong financial resources, it is still necessary for women to be members of a major political party in order to get into Parliament. Together, they were an inspiration to the human spirit. I also visited the Sunrise Children's Village, just out of Phnom Penh. This is an orphanage administered by an Australian Geraldine Cox, where about 70 destitute children (often in sibling groups) live, go to school and learn independence and responsibility. By the time the children leave at age 18 they are able to support themselves. The Cambodian culture and music is also taught at the school. The orphanage has been featured on Australian television. I also visited \"The Friends\" restaurant in Phnom Penh, which provides training and employment in the hospitality industry to former street children. The Australian firm BHP have supported the publication of a recipe book and the sale of the book supports the restaurant which appeared to be very well patronised. A visit was made to the Cambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC) where I observed the process of training for mine clearing. The CMAC has set itself a goal of no land Anew mine victims by 2012. Although the number of injuries has dropped in recent years, there were 800 people injured in Cambodia last year. Mines were set, often in productive farming districts, along the Thai and Vietnamese borders during war time in Cambodia. About 4500 square kilometres and 5 million people remain at risk - that is almost 40% of villages and 43% of the Cambodian population. AUSAID have given annual grants of around AUS $2 million since 2000, and there are 5 Australian workers involved in the land clearing process. As a further demonstration of the devastating effects of land mines, I visited the Kien Kleang Rehabilitation Centre which provides assistance for land mine victims. During 2004-5 Australia will provide AUS $53,000 so that 100 land mine victims will be fitted with prostheses which are made at the centre. I was able to observe the end result as former victims started using their new artificial limbs. They would be able to regain a degree of physical and economic independence not possible before. There are some international crime issues which impact on Australia and I visited the Trans-National Crime Centre, which has Australian and Cambodian personnel. The main focus is on narcotics but activities also include the co-ordination and investigation of trans-national crimes including people smuggling, money laundering, illicit drugs and child sex tourism offences. THAILAND - 11 JANUARY to 15 JANUARY, 2005 Meetings were held in Bangkok at the Australian Embassy, many of whose personnel had been deployed to work in areas affected by the tsunami. However, I was able to meet with the Deputy Head of Mission, who gave a briefing on the response to the tsunami and possible Australian casualties. There was also a briefing on the benefits to Australia of the Australia-Thai Free Trade Agreement which has recently come into force. These benefits are significant. Both milk and dairy products as well as wool now are not subject to tariffs and the benefits for Australia's business and education exports are greatly enhanced Ten thousand Thai students study in Australia and there is a growing demand for international schools in Bangkok, in which Australia would be well placed to compete. As an Australian, I was interested to travel to Katchanaburi to visit the Bridge on the River Kwai and the Chukei war cemetery where the remains of hundreds of Australian prisoners of war are buried. It is a salutary reminder of the sacrifice made by thousands of our young soldiers during World War II. I also travelled on the train to the jungle area, and although today the countryside carries maize and sugar cane, the terrible journey as the railway was carved out of tropical jungle by our soldiers should never be forgotten. I visited the Thai Warehouse Fruits and Flowers Markets situated on the outskirts of Bangkok, some 1.5 hours drive from the city. The market, which operates on a 24 hour basis, is rung by a privately owned company and was built on a greenfield site. Meat and fish are also sold, and most buildings on site were purpose built, allowing the integration of modern chilling and hygiene facilities. The site occupies 200 acres and is open to both wholesale and retail customers. Given the proposed relocation of some metropolitan market sites in Australia, this was an interesting concept. A visit was also made to the Horticulture Research Institute, one of four in Thailand with subsidiary experimental stations. The research priorities and objectives are set largely by government; a different scenario to that in Australia, where industry and government work closely together. However, there is a degree of co-operation with Australian agencies such as ACIAR. All funding is provided by government, and research is decentralised throughout rural areas of Thailand, both for projects and technology transfer. There appears to be little involvement with industry, other than through demonstration of research results. VO W w 4 r. 'I MALAYSIA \u201415 JANUARY to 18 JANUARY Kuala Lumpur. Trade again was a strong focus in the visit to Kuala Lumpur. The possibility of a free trade agreement with ASEAN countries and Australia and New Zealand is very exciting. Malaysia is Australia's third largest trading partner in the ASEAN bloc, particularly for the food industry. As the food industry is Australia's largest manufacturing industry, rising economic levels in Malaysia present a tremendous opportunity. Again, education is important here. Many older Malaysians benefited from the Colombo Plan, gaining their tertiary education in Australia, and our country is seen as a good one in which to invest and be educated. Twenty eight thousand Malaysian students study in Australian institutions, either in Australia or off-shore. I also attended briefings on international business in Malaysian and Australian business investment in Malaysia. The High Commissioner, Mr James Wise, hosted a lunch with four Malaysian MP's present, as well as business people and AUSTRADE representatives. I am very appreciative of the opportunity to travel as an Australian Member of Parliament, and found the trip to be very informative. Some of the meetings informed my past work in the Parliament with agriculture. In the past, I have also been a member of Foreign Affairs and Trade Committees, a role I hope to take up in the future, and this comment also applies to the meetings involved with education, as I am a former teacher. The study trip showed valuable aspects of our foreign aid program, especially showing the value of relatively small amounts of money and how it can be used effectively at a local level. I note that in accordance with Clause 9.5 of the Remuneration Tribunal Determination No 14 of 2003, a copy of this statement may be obtained from you upon request by any Senator or Member. I also note that this statement will be tabled in Parliament. Yours sincerely, Judith Troeth SENATOR FOR VICTORIA )PL-It\" , End. This Page Is Intentionally Left Blank SENATOR JIEA14NIE FERRIS PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA\u00e2\u00a2 THE SENATIE Senator Jeannie Ferris Senator for South Australia 19 February 2005 Senator the Hon Eric Abetz Special Minister of State Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 Dear Minister, In accordance with the requirements of clause 9.2 (b) of Remuneration Tribunal Determination No 14. of 2003, I submit the following statement reporting on my recent overseas study journey. I confirm that the purpose of my travel was to hold meetings relating to AUSAID projects in Vietnam and Cambodia, the pursuit of Free Trade Agreements with Thailand and Malaysia, the effort to combat the trafficking of women and children throughout Asia and the ways in which our world class education system Is being promoted to our Asian neighbours. For ease of reconciliation, I will attach the final Synergi Parliamentary travel Itinerary to confirm my travel arrangements. Vietnam- 3 January to 7 January Hanoi. A briefing was organised with Richard Martin of the Department of Education Science and Training regarding bilateral relations between Australia and Vietnam in relation to education and a meeting was arranged with former Vietnamese Ambassador Michael Mann who is now President of the RMIT international University Vietnam, RMIT was invited by the Government of Vietnam to open the first International University in Vietnam In 1998 and It remains the only fully foreign-owned university In the country, with campuses In both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. One area of RMIT's work in Vietnam that I found particularly Interesting Is an agreement that RMIT Vietnam has entered Into with the AWB Umlted to develop the AWB - Centre of Excellence for Professional Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 Tel (02) 6277 3440 Fax: (02) 6277 3443 Ill Parliamentary office 100 Ki ng William Street ADELAIDE 5* 5000 Tel (08) 8237 6840 Far (08)8237 6849 Development\" to train bakers from across Asia. AWB Limited have supplied the machinery, equipment, expertise and product for the centre's operation and RMIT Vietnam provides the venue and training staff to develop and deliver the courses. This will obviously assist in the imports of Australian wheat to Vietnam as well as increasing the goodwill between the two countries. Opened in late 2004, the Centre is providing courses in baking to students from across the region beginning in 2005. The joint project has given AWB marketing opportunities for the promotion of Australian wheat and RMIT Vietnam now has one of the most modern baking training facilities in the region. As a member of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee and as Chair of the Government's backbench committee on agriculture. I was Interested to see this unique marketing arrangement which AWB Limited has established and I will be Interested to follow its progress In the future. A visit was organised to the Hanoi campus of RMIT to discuss their English language program for students who have scholarships to study In Australia. During my visit to the campus, I took the opportunity to sit In on several of the classes and meet with a number of the students who will be travelling to Australia to continue their education. A business lunch was organised by Ambassador Joe Thwaltes and Included a number of Members of the \\1etnamese Parliament, where we discussed issues that affect our nations. While in Hanoi, a meeting took place with Tim Gauchi, Senior Trade Commissioner of Austrade in Vietnam. Austrade assists Australian companies by Introducing them to new customers, providing them with accurate Information regarding business opportunities and organising appointments tailored to Individual businesses. Importantly for Australian companies looking to expand into the country, Vietnam's annual economic growth rate In 2004 was 7.5%, with growth in imports of 33%. Australia's exports to Vietnam were worth $A424 million in 2003 and there is room for expansion In many sectors which Austrade can help facilitate. While Australia remains Vietnam's fourth largest export destination, we rank only 18 1h for Imports Into Vietnam. Australia's main exports to Vietnam Include aluminium, copper and wheat and our main Imports are petroleum, fruits and nuts and furniture. The main potential for an Increase In exports to Vietnam II a 14 comes from agribusiness sector products, particularly in the wool, dairy products and live cathe industries. In addition to the meeting with Tim Gauchi, a meeting was also organised with a number of local business people who export to Australia but are having difficulties gaining markets for their products. While in Hanoi I drove two hours into the country to visit two AusAlD funded projects. One helps disabled children who are shown how to make clothes using machines purchased with a one-off grant and the other is a school which Australian funds have assisted in the upgrading and repair of classrooms and a library. It was rewarding to visit these sites and to see first hand the work being undertaken in Vietnam through AusAlD and the benefits these projects have on local communities which continue to suffer severe poverty. A visit was also organised to another rural region outside Hanoi where the Australian Government is sponsoring a water purification project through AusAID. One third of the Vietnamese population are classified as poor and one of the major problems associated with this poverty is a lack of access to clean water. In total, Australia 's overseas development assistance to Vietnam during 2004-05 is estimated be $73.7 million. This is comprised of $59.4 million in direct bilateral assistance and $14.3 million in other assistance. While in Hanoi, a roundtable discussion hosted by Mr Gauci was organised with members of the Vietnamese tourism industry including Do lung Lam and Iran lien Nghi of the Vietnamese Tourism Association, Nguyen Hong Diep and Nguyen Le Huong of Vietravel, Nguyen Huu Viet of the Hanoi Administration of Tourism and Suzy Walker of Dietheim Travel. One of the main impediments for the future expansion of Australian tourism opportunities in Vietnam is the number of people who obtain tourist visas for Australia but fail to return to Vietnam at the end of their stay. This causes problems for other people who genuinely want to visit Australia but find it difficult to obtain the necessary visa. Cambodia- January 7 January to 11 January Phnom Penh. From Vietnam I travelled to Cambodia where I was greeted by the Australian Ambassador, Ms Lisa Filipeffo and received a briefing with Mr Ken Harding, Head of the Australian Federal Police in Cambodia, Ms Fleur Davies, Head of AIJSAID and Ms Sarah Forbes, Head of the Department of Immigration. 12 A meeting was organised through the Embassy with 2 female Cambodian Parliamentarians, Lady HE Mrs Sam Kanitha, Senator for the Kingdom of Cambodia and HE Ms Khuon Sodary MP. The Cambodian Parliament consists of 183 members, which includes 33 women. The Parliament has 9 permanent commissions; 1. The Commission on the Protection of Human Rights and Reception of Complains; 2. The Commission on Finance and Banking; 3. The Commission on Economics, Planning, Investment, Rural Development, and Environment: 4. The Commission on Interior, National Defence, Investigations, and Anticorruption; 5. The Commission on Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation. Media, and Information; 6. The Commission on Legislation: 7. The Commission on Education, Religious Affairs, Culture and Tourism; 8. The Commission on Health, Social Affairs, Labor, and Women 's Affairs: and 9. The Commission on Public Works, Transportation, Telecommunications, Post, Industry, Energy, and Commerce. Each Commission consists of a Chairperson, a Vice Chairperson, a Secretary, and 6 members and has a Constitutional right to Invite members of the Royal Government to clarify Issues within their mandate. The Cambodian Parliament has enacted two separate laws on trafficking and a Police Department of Anti-Human Trafficking and Juvenile Protection was organised In 2002. People trafficking is now a priority Issue for the Government and Department of Human Trafficking has been established. There is broad co-operation between the Cambodian Government and Its neighbours with a recognition that the trafficking of women and children is a world-wide problem with International co-operation required to ensure It Is stopped. Each of the women I met with provided a graphic example of the tragedy of the P01 Pot regime which saw 1.7 million Khmer people murdered. Views on the effect this murderous regime had on the population reminds an enduring legacy. While In Cambodia, I took the opportunity to travel about 30 minutes out of Phnom Penh to the Sunrise Children's Village to view the work being undertaken by Geraldine Cox AM, a former Australian diplomat who now administers the ophanage. About 70 orphaned children who would otherwise have no home live at the village, ranging in age from 3 months to 17 years. Sunrise Village provides a loving, safe and secure home for the children which teaches them responsibility and Independence. The aim of the home is that when the children leave the village at age 18, they are able to lead independent lives and support themselves while nuturing their understanding and appreciation of their own culture and traditions. I also met with Tom Harley from BHP Billiton to discuss support for a project which involves offering employment and training to street children In the capital. These children operate a restaurant known as The Friends, where young men and women are trained In the hospitality Industry. BHP have supported the publication of a food book the sale of which also supports the restaurant. There Is great Interest In the Increase of Australian trade with Cambodia. Around 20 businesses currently have representative offices In the capital and Australia continues to have a trade surplus with Cambodia and our exports rose by 33.4% in 2003-04. We discussed future opportunities for Australian businesses to expand into Cambodia. A trip was organised to the monument at the Killing Fields which has been established to recognise the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime. The monument is a very poignant reminder of the horrors perpetuated by the regime, with 9.000 skulls of victims placed in a formation that rises over thirty feet high into the air. While in Cambodia, I visited the Cambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC) where there were examples of various mines and missiles. There are 5 Australian workers Involved in the land clearing process through CMAC and since 2000, annual grants of around $A2mIllion have been given through AUSAID to support CMAC's annual lntergrated Work Plan. Between 4 and 6 million mines were set In provinces along the Thai and Vietnamese borders during the ongoing conflicts In Cambodia and these have a continuing impact on the Cambodian people. In 1999. 1154 people were injured by Iandmines. By 2004, the number of Injuries had dropped to 800. Since hostilities ended in Cambodia, there have been 50,000 amputations as a result of land mine and ordinance explosions. CMAC has a goal to ensure there will be no land mine victims by 2012. It is estimated that 4.500 square kilometres and over 5 million people remain at risk from IandmInes and unexoded ordnance. This equates 4 I S to almost 40% of all villages and 43% of the Cambodian population. These affected communities have restricted access to both natural resources such as land and water for farming and transport and government services. With an overall budget of $US1O million CMAC was established in 1992 when over 600 people were being killed or maimed by unexploded ordinances each month. From 1993 to May 2003, CMAC has been able to free more then 106 square kilometres of mines and unexploded ordinances. CMAC has found and destroyed 3,514 mines and 750,887 unexploded ordinances, and cleared over 273,732,034 fragments and 1,400 minefields. Thanks to This work, 504.000 people have been released from the constant threat of landmines. I also saw the devastating results of land mines when I visited the Kien Kleang Rehabilitation Centre which provides assistance for men, women and children who have been injured by iandmines around the country. A total of $A53.000 has been provided to the Landmine Victims Support Program for 2004-05, ensuring that around 100 landmine victims will be fitted with protheses. The Centre also provides Therapy and exercise to help victims adjust to life with a prosthetic limb and a small cash grant to enable around 50 families of land mine victims to purchase items such as a bike or boat to assist with the transport of goods to market. Watching men and women learning to use their new artificial limbs which have been provided by Australian aid was a very rewarding experience and clear evidence that AusAlD targeted assistance is paying great benefits to the farming population most affected by these mines. While in Cambodia I also received a briefing regarding people trafficking Issues from Janet Ashby, Cambodia Project Manager for The Asia Regional Cooperation to Prevent People Trafficking (ARCPPT). This Is a three year development cooperation project funded by the Australian Government through the Australian Agency for International Development. The goal of the ARCPPT is to contribute to the prevention of people trafficking throughout South East Asia with an initial focus on Cambodia, Burma. Laos and Thailand and $A8 million has been provided for three years for the project. ARCPPT Cambodia Is based in and works under a Memorandum of Arrangement with the Ministry of Justice. p. Today there are several areas of trafficking which the ARCPPT focuses on; - trafficking of Cambodians for sexual exploitation both within Cambodia and beyond its borders; - trafficking of other nationalities into Cambodia for sexual exploitation; - trafficking of Cambodian children and old people for begging, particularly to neighbouring countries; - trafficking for fishing, agriculture, and factories, mostly to other countries; and - trafficking for domestic labour; and - trafficking of babies for adoption. Criminal gangs are now Involved in the trafficking process and according to estimates from Interpol. trafficking Is the second most profitable crime after drugs. This was followed by a visit to the Trans-national Crime Centre, which had just organised a large heroin bust which involved an Australian element. The Centre was previously managed from Bangkok and since it has been in operation it has gained a better understanding of the specific crime issues in Cambodia which impact on Australia. The Centre has its main focus on narcotics, and also includes the coordination and investigation of transnational crimes including people smuggling, money laundering, illicit drugs and child sex tourism offences. There is also a small focus on counter-terrorism issues as Cambodia is seen as a country at risk for terrorism and as a place to recruit for terrorist activities. Thailand- 11 January to 15 January Bangkok. From Cambodia I travelled to Thailand, where a meeting was also organised with Mr John Griffin, Deputy Head of Mission, in place of Ambassador Mr Bill Patterson who was working in the tsunami hit region of Thailand at the time. The briefing Included a summary of the Embassy's response to the Tsunami and the Australian casualties at that time. I also met with Sean Riley from Austrade who gave a presentation on the benefits of Australia's Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Thailand which has recently come into force. The FTA will give many Australian exporters, especially those from rural industries, new opportunities in a flourishing market. Milk and dairy products, which are one of Australia's top ten export items into Thailand, have see an immediate elimination of the previous tariffs on infant formula of 5%, lactose (up to 20%), casein and milk albumin (10%). Tariffs on buffer fat, milkfood, yoghurt, dairy spreads and ice cream will be phased to zero in 2010. Australia's exports of wool Into Thailand which are worth almost $A 100 million each year are also now tarrif free as a result of the implementation of the FTA. Thailand has been given the nickname, the Detroit of Asia with 15 car manufacturers now based in the country with a total production capacity of 1 million units per year. Thailand has 3 million passenger vehicles on the road with 3.7 million pick up vans and trucks. Its domestic vehicle market is expected to reach 600,000 sales this year. Australia also benefits from the growing foreign education market in Thailand which has seen 35,000 students move offshore to study. Australia currently is the largest supplier of off-shore education with 10,000 Thai students studying In Australia. In addition to the off-shore placements, there is also a growing demand for international schools in Bangkok. A meeting took place with the Director General of prisons Nathee Chitsawang, too discuss the Issue of transferring Australian prisoners back to Australia to ensure they can serve out their remaining sentences in an Australian prison. I then travelled to a women's prison and met with an Australian female prisoner who Is serving a drug related sentence but applied to serve the rest of her sentence In an Australian prison. Since the first transfer of a prisoner was organised last year, a total of 3 prisoners have been transferred back to Australia to serve out their sentences. The young woman indicated that she would appreciate the opportunity to engage in further study but this was not possible in the Thai prison. My work with the Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission and Its report into the trafficking of women for sexual servitude prompted me to visit the Kredtrakarn Protection and Occupational Development Centre which Is a Government Centre for victims of commercial sexual exploitation. Commonly known as Kredtrakarn Home, the facility was established In 1960 under the department of Public Welfare and currently has 359 women and children residing there. 148 of the residents are Thai and the foreign residents of the facility are typically from countries such as Cambodia. Laos and Burma. Many of these women at the facility come from poor, rural areas and were brought to Thailand under the guise of working as waitresses, 7 There are three target groups for the facility; 1. Girls under 18 who are engaged in prostitution or women over 18 who wish to receive protection under the Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act of 1999; 2. Women who suffer social problems; and 3. Women and girls, both Thai and Non-Thai who are victims of trafficking. The Centre provides a number of services to the women Including; - accommodation; - care; - services; - vocational training; - education; - early childhood and - recreational services and development centre; social activities; - reintegration assistance; - psycho-social recovery and programs; - family assistance. The process of protection of the girls and women included 24 hour enrolment, orientation, interviewing, medical care, legal assistance in cases of abuse, family tracing and assessment, repatriation for girls and women from outside Thailand, Integration and follow up to check on how the women are going. The process of repatriation and reintegration of non-Thai residents is particularly interesting. The social workers or caretakers will accompany the victims home to ensure safe repatriation and cooperation will local agencies for continued assistance. The women stay between 6 months and a year depending on their age and some of the women give birth while they remain at the facility. This is not an unusual occurrence, as currently there are 15 babies which have been born at the facility. A meeting was also organised with Walaiiak Noypayak the deputy director of the Tourism Authority of Thailand to discuss The Impact of the Boxing Day tsunami on tourism In Thailand, particularly the southern region of the country which was hardest hit by the disaster. 12% of Thailand's GDP is currently derived from tourism and this will no doubt drop as a result of the disaster. However the Tourism Authority believe that the industry will recover from the devastation of the tsunami faster then from either the bird flu epidemic or SAPS which have impacted on their Industry in the past. The tsunami is seen as a one off act of God 18 whereas the impact of SAPS and bird flu are seen as a more ongoing concern to the region. The Thai tourism Industry has rebounded from what Is termed in the region as \"constant shock syndrome\". Prior to the tsunami and the bird flu epidemic, Thailand's tourism industry suffered a downturn after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Asian financial crisis and before that, the haze from the out of control bushfires on Sumatra which affected I the tourist resorts in the south of the country. While in Thailand, I took the opportunity to travel to Katchanaburi to visit the Bridge on The River Kwai and the Chukel war cemetery where many hundreds of Australian prisoners of war are buried. While at Katchanabrul I visited the Jeath museum which was founded 25 years ago to mark the prisoner of war camp which was operated there by the Japanese and to remind future generations of the sacrifice of prisoners of war. The role played at the camp by Australian doctor Sir Edward Dunlop was particularly moving, and reports of his death In Australia several years ago was a reminder of his great contribution to the medical profession. Jeoth stands for Japan, England, Australia, Thailand and Holland, the five notions which were involved in the building of the railway and bridge. The museum itself is on the banks of the river Kwai, and consists of a war memorial based around a bodhi tree and a replica of one of the huts. A railway trip up to the jungle area and over the bridge built by the prisoners of war was a moving experience, particularly the remoteness of the location. The immense sacrifice of these men was marked by small crosses and memorials along the way. It was interesting to note that much of the thick undergrowth adjacent to the railway has now been cleared and in Its place are crops of maize and sugar cane, a far cry from the thick tropical undergrowth of the region during World War It. I visited the Thai Warehouse Fruits and Flowers Markets situated on the outskirts of Bangkok, some 1.5 hours drive from the city. The market, which operates on 024 hour basis, is run by a privately owned company and was built on a greenfield site. Meat and fish are also sold, and most buildings on site were purpose built, allowing the integration of modem chilling and hygiene facilities. The site occupies 200 acres and is open to both wholesale and retail customers. Given the proposed relocation of some metropolitan market sites in Australia, this was an Interesting concept. 11) f A visit was also made to the Horticulture Research Institute, one of four in Thailand with subsidiary experimental stations. The research priorities and objectives are set largely by government; a different scenario to that in Australia, where industry and government work closely together. However, there is a degree of co-operation with Australian agencies such as ACIAR. All funding Is provided by government, and research is decentralised throughout rural areas of Thailand, both for projects and technology transfer. There appears to be little involvement with Industry, other than through demonstration of research results. Malaysia- 15 to 18 January Kuala Lumpur. From Thailand I travelled to Malaysia where I met with the Australian Ambassador James Wise and received a number of briefings relating to merchandise trade opportunities for Australia in Malaysia, the growth In service exports through education and the possibility of a Free Trade Agreement between Australia and Malaysia. Malaysia is Australia's tenth biggest trading partner In the world and our third largest trading partner in ASEAN with trade and investment has grown steadily over recent years. Two way trade between the two nations stands at $A3 billion, compared to $A2.4 billion in 1993-94. The recent growth in Australia's merchandise exports has come from pharmaceutical and aluminium sales as well as sugar, dairy products and wheat, while oil products and information technology dominate Imports from Australia. Australia Is currently the third largest supplier of food to Malaysia. Australian investment in Malaysia was only $263 million in 2003. This is compared to $3.2 billion of Malaysian Investment In Australia. The Malaysian economy has boomed In the past two decades. Poverty levels now stand at 5 percent, compared with 30 percent In 1980. Low unemployment and low inflation remain and average Incomes have Increased 2 and a half times that of 15 years ago. This gives a heightened Imperative to the scoping studies which are currently being undertaken by both Governments to provide the basis for the Australian and Malaysian Governments to decide whether to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement. The benefits of a Malaysia- Australia Free Trade Agreement will be for reaching. In 2003, the average tariff on Australian exports to Malaysia was 9.3%. However certain exports including Australian vehicles and parts have a much higher tariff placed on them. Australia's tariffs on Malaysian imports averaged 3.9% 10 There are also significant barriers for service trade with Australia, with barriers to imports into Malaysia of education, legal, accounting, architectural, engineering and financial services which can be eliminated Through a Free Trade Agreement. I also received a briefing from Dr Matthew Sukumaran, Deputy Director of Australian Education International (AEI) regarding the growth in Australia's service exports to Malaysia the emphasis on education-related services. 21% or $US5 billion, of the Malaysian budget is devoted to education. This is The largest proportion of any country in the world. In addition about 28,000 Malaysian students are studying in Australian institutions both in Australia and offshore. The areas of study at Australian facilities which have The highest enrolments of Malaysian students are business administration and management, engineering and surveying, medical science and computer science and Information Systems. I also received briefings from Mr Wayne Roberts, President of Alstrom Malaysia and Mr Mark Clarke, Chief Operations Officer- Asia and Mr David Hunter of Sinclair Knight Merz who outlined a number of issues with doing business in Malaysia. Discussions were held on the impact of the Australian Government's relations with its Malaysian counterpart on Australian business investment within Malaysia. Australian High Commissioner, Mr James Wise, hosted a lunch with four Malaysian Members of Parliament. Dr James Dawos Mamit MP, Mr Ng Lip Yong MP, Senator Datin Naomi Chong Set Mul and Mrs Rosnah binti Haji Abdul Rashid Shirkin MP. The lunch also included a number of Australian business people and Austrade staffers. A number of issues were discussed at this lunch In relation to Australia's trade with Malaysia and the increased opportunities rural industries will have to export under any Free Trade Agreement signed between Australia and Malaysia. My study tour was most interesting and Informative and all of my meetings were very valuable. These meetings are relevant to my work as a member of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission. In addition The meetings I attended were also relevant to my role as the Chair of the Government Policy Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Chair of the Federal Liberal Rural and Regional Committee. 21 p Yours sincerely, eannie Ferris Senator for South Australia Government Whip in the Senate t I note that in accordance with clause 9.5 of the Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 14 of 2003, a copy of this statement may be obtained from you upon request by any Senator or Member. I also note that this statement may be tabled in Parliament at your discretion. 4 If MR GRAHAM EDWARDS MP Report on Overseas Travel to Vietnam By Graham Edwards Member for Cowan. Date of Travel from 5.01 .05 to 9.01.05 and 15.01.05. The travel was taken in addition to my attendance as a delegate to the 13th APP Forum held in Hanoi and Ha Long City in Vietnam from the 9th of Jan 05 to the 15th of Jan 05. My key meetings were with Mr. Tim Gauci, Senior Trade Commissioner, Austrade Vietnam on both the 6th of Jan and the 8th of Jan. Discussions centred on economic development and opportunity in Vietnam and developments in the cattle and wine industry in particular. Both of these industries present opportunities to Western Australian producers and exporters. One of the key issues is the tariff impost on Australian wines imported into Vietnam and the planned decrease in these tariffs in may 2005. The other key meeting was a briefing provided to me by the U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command. This briefing was also attended by Mr. Joe Thwaites, Australia's Ambassador to Vietnam. The briefing was provided by Major Jay A. Rutter, USMC Deputy Commander and Mr. Gary Flanagan. JPAC provided me with an overview of their operations and also enabled me to raise a number of issues relating to the activities of Operation Aussie Home. This is an Australian organisation dedicated to achieving: \"A full and definitive accounting For those Australians killed in action, or missing in action and presumed dead, and whose bodies were not recovered during the Vietnam war 1962\u2014 1972 or subsequently.\" This briefing enabled me to address some issues previously supplied to Australian Authorities and the U.S. JPAC. The major outcome of the of the meeting was a commitment by JPAC to further investigate a site identified as the location of the remains of one of the Australian Servicemen killed in Vietnam dependant upon a request being made by the Australian authorities on a goveimnent to government basis. I have undertaken to pursue this matter with the Minister for Defence. This meeting was the main purpose for accessing my travel entitlement though I also took the opportunity to familiarise myself with the city of Hanoi and in particular a visit to the mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh and the war museum in Hanoi.

I understand that this statement may be tabled in the Parliament at the discretion of the Special Minister of State. Harry Quick MP Federal Member for Franklin I 27 OVERVIEW As Vice President of the World Scouting Parliamentary Union (WSPU) I was asked to represent the Executive at the 12' h Pan-American Jamboree to be held in San Raphael, Argentina. WSPU is a network of National Scouting Parliamentary Associations that exist in over IOU countries worldwide and their members are Members, Deputies or Senators of National Parliaments. The WSPU General Assembly is the supreme body of the Union and meets every three years, each time in a different country. I had the pleasure to represent Australia at the 3\" General Assembly in Warsaw in 2000 and at the 4th Genera] Assembly held in Cairo in 2003. PURPOSE OF VISIT To represent the WSPU Executive at the 12' b Pan-American Jamboree and also to represent Scouts Australia. I was asked by John Ravenhall AM, Chief Commissioner of Scouts Australia, to liaise with officials from the attending South and Central American countries as to the possibility of their supporting Australia's bid to host the 2011 World Scout Jamboree, World Youth Forum and World Youth Conference. My other task was to explore the possibility of arranging inter-country scout exchanges between Australia and the countries of South and Central America; their hosting by expatriates living in Australia and the various State Scouting bodies. 3 AGENDA AND PROGRAM Monday 10 January 2005 a Arrived in Santiago, Chile by Lan Chile Flight from Sydney arriving at 1235pm. Car from Australian Embassy to my hotel. Organised tour of the city in the afternoon. Tuesday 11 January 2005 I met with Gerardo Gonzales, CEO and various officials of the Interamerican Scout Organisation. I received an extensive briefing on their role in administering the whole of South, Central and North American Scouting. I explained my role as Vice President of WSPU and the thrust of our executive meeting deliberations in Tokyo in December 2004 and preparations unfolding regarding the 2007 World Jamboree - celebrating the Centenary of World Scouting. I presented Gerado with a gift from Scouts Tasmania, a watercolour painting of the Channel Region of my electorate. The Logo of the Gerardo Gonzales, with the watercolour in the background Scouting Movement in South America Later in the day I met Eduardo Missioni, Secretary General of WOSM and held further discussions regarding his role at the Panainencan Jamboree, his expectations of members of WSPU, especially the Executive. I briefed him on Scouts Australia plans to host the 2 functions held in conjunction with the World Jamboree in 2011, and the visit of World Scouting Bureau officials to Australia to inspect facilities and meet with the Prime Minister's office and the Premier of New South Wales. 4 Wednesday 12 January 2005 Above. Views from the highest point crossing the Ande s . Left Santiago early in the morning for the 10 hour drive across the Andes Mountains to San Raphael, Argentina. Passed through immigration checks from Chile and Argentina Close to Mendoza and San Raphael a very un-seasonal rainstorm dumped close to 75 mm of rain over the Andean catchment causing flash flooding and landslips which delayed our journey. Finally arrived at the Jamboree site; changed into my scouting clothes and headed for the World Bureau tent. Here I renewed acquaintances with Andrea Morales and met Nikki Gooderson also from the World Bureau office. The World Bureau tent The Australian flag flies proudly I presented the Australian flag to Jamboree officials to fly along side the flags of other countries attending the Jamboree. 30 5 Arrentine Scouts makine learnine aids for the local school Interviewed by local media 6 Later in the afternoon, WOSM gave a briefing to officials from all the attending countries, and showed the official video highlighting the 2007 World Jamboree to be held in the United Kingdom to celebrate the I 00 anniversary of World Scouting. Eduardo Mjssjoni welcomed the officials on behalf of the World Bureau and later invited everyone to the official reception. I met with many of the officials from the visiting countries at the Jamboree and used this opportunity to speak of Australia's wish to host the three functions in 2011. Thursday 13 January 2005 Today consisted of spending the morning with several groups of scouts from various parts of Argentina as they worked in collaboration with officials from UNICEF at tasks allocated to them by the organising committee. The tasks varied from working with people in the aged care sector and with young people with disabilities, to erecting new playground equipment in the many parks in San Raphael, to preparing educational aids for children at the local schools. The local media were interested in my perceptions of the work being undertaken by the scouts, my impression of the Jamboree, my role as Vice-President of WSPU and why Scouts Australia were keen to establish a closer link with scouts from South and Central American countries. Clockwise from top left: Argentine Scouts, waiting for the rafters to appear; surfing the channel - a ihrillfor scouts who rarely see water In the afternoon I, along with other officials, toured and participated in some of the many activities that were being undertaken by scouts attending the Jamboree. Later in the evening I attended along with officials from all the various scout groups a reception hosted by the 800 strong Chilean delegation. This reception consisted of a video presentation of the last World Scout Jamboree held in Chile, and a series of dances, songs and visual displays highlighting their history and culture. I was presented with a memento of the evening by officials from Scouts Chile. Mess tent for 7,500 scouts 7 Friday 14 January 2005 Another busy day was spent at the Jamboree. I participated in a variety of activities based in and around the Jamboree site. These consisted of a series of meetings with scouts and leaders from attending countries - Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Chile and Paraguay - in a series of forums discussing issues of leadership, liaison with other organisations (UNICEF), intercultural exchanges and the role of scouting in a world where globalisation dominates most issues. Leaders hip Jo rum Leadership Jo rum I also held discussions with leaders from WOSM over possible avenues and strategies to ensure that scouts from all regions, all ethnic and religious backgrounds could attend the World Youth Forum to be held in Tunisia in September 2005. Later that evening I, along with the other leaders, attended a reception hosted by the large delegation from Argentina and again I was presented with a gift from the host nation. The Tango Argentina's signature dance performed by scouts 8 33 Saturday 15 January 2005 The final day of the Jamboree was spent tidying up, packing up and finalizing last minute preparations for the closing ceremony. I assisted the members of the World Bureau in ensuring that as many scouts from all the countries had visited the tent and taken away information regarding the 2007 Jamboree -celebrating the 100th anniversary of World Scouting. The closing ceremony, held at dusk, was an opportunity for each of the participating countries-Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costs Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Scotland, Uruguay, United States, Venezuela-to present an item highlighting part of their history and culture. Prior to the fireworks display, the Peruvian scouting delegation presented an amazing video highlighting the proposed 2008 Jamboree to be held at Cuzco, in Peru. Sunday 16 January 2005 Left San Raphael early in the morning for the long 10 hour drive back across the Andes mountains to Santiago, Chile for an overnight stay prior to returning home to Tasmania the following day. 34 9 SENATOR MARISE PAYNE VISIT TO THAILAND AND CAMBODIA 20 January 2005 to 29 January 2005 This study visit was carried out by both Senator Manse Payne and Senator Brett Mason. Separate reports have been supplied to the Minister. THAILAND The portion of this study visit dedicated to Thailand was necessarily shortened by the tragic events of December 26 2004, when a tsunami hit the region and in this case, specifically the Thai coast with enormous force, killing thousands of people, both Thai citizens and tourists, including Australians. The work of the Australian embassy in Thailand was overwhelmingly consumed by this event, and the new Australian Ambassador to Thailand, HE Mr Bill Paterson began his role in Thailand assisting Australians in this tragedy. That the tragedy occurred at the time of the Christmas/New Year vacation period made the immediate response of the embassy and consular staff an indication of their professionalism and commitment. Mr Paterson's interviews assumed great prominence in the Australian media as an important, primary source of Australian focussed information. His presence on the ground in the area devastated by the tsunami gave the information provided an immediacy and currency that assisted the Australian public to understand the enormity of the tragedy. From all reports and from my observations, I commend the work of the Australian officials involved in both consular and police work. It was vital to Australians with friends and family in the region to receive reliable information as soon as possible and the consular work of the Australian mission (and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) officers in Canberra), assisted significantly in this area. For Australians in Thailand, official support in receiving medical assistance, in the desperate search for missing family and friends and in replacing valuable lost travel documents and other items, and in a myriad of other ways, was of inestimable assistance in lessening the burden faced in those first days. After the horrific act of terrorism that was the Bali bombing in 2002, several parliamentary committees of which I am a member received useful briefings as to the work of consular staff in assisting both those directly involved in the tragedy and their family and friends in the difficult and traumatic days after the event. The reports I have received since the tsunami are a further indication that those efforts of DFAT officers are conducted sensitively and professionally, and are of great assistance to Australians in need. It is also important to note that these tragic events do place an enormous professional 2 and psychological load on the officers concerned, whose work is necessarily carried out in circumstances of great stress and very challenging environments. It was very useful for my parliamentary work in this area to receive briefing on this work in Thailand itself, and also so soon after the tragic event. It is also important to acknowledge the work of the Australian Federal Police (AFP), in particular in relation to Disaster Victim Identification. As well as providing immediate skilled support in this area, the early involvement of the Federal Police is a very tangible example of the effective working relationships the AFP have created in our region. AFP officers are located in the Australian embassy in Bangkok, and work with the Thai police to build an effective relationship on law enforcement matters, and to address important matters of crime and security in the region. Over several years now, my parliamentary work as Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has meant a significant amount of time each year is spent working with the AFP in the estimates process and in the examination of legislation in the area of criminal law. I have observed with interest the growth of the regional engagement of the AFP and the rapid deployment of AFP DVI teams in this tragedy is a good example of the trust at the basis of the relationship with Thailand's police and the high regard in which the AFP's professional capacity in this area is held. Given the impact of the tsunami crisis on the mission's work load, I was very grateful for the opportunity to be briefed by Ambassador Bill Paterson and officers of the embassy in Bangkok. The current political situation in Thailand and relationships with Australia formed the basis of the Ambassador's briefing. As referred to above, Mr Paterson also provided a briefing in relation to Australia's response to the tsunami. Indications were that the post-tsunami work of the AFP, in cooperation with the Thai authorities, would continue for some time as the massive task of identifying victims was pursued. Australia and Thailand have a very sound relationship, based on years of engagement including sound diplomatic, defence, aid and law enforcement cooperation activities. Just over two weeks from the time of this visit, Thailand was going to the polls, on February 6th. Campaigning was clearly evident from posters and street signs, and the local print media was concentrating on political developments. The impression received was that the government of Prime Minister Thaksin would be returned, in all likelihood with an increased majority. This indeed transpired and marks a notable point in the democratic process in Thailand. As Chair of the Government Members Committee on Trade and Foreign Affairs, and as a member of the Senate Legislation Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I have an ongoing interest in Australia's trade relationships and in recent times the development of bilateral trade agreements. One case in point is the Australia/Thai Free Trade Agreement (FTA). I was pleased to receive a briefing on the FTA from Australia's Senior Trade Commissioner in Thailand, Mr Sean Riley. 3 37 The FTA has presented a significant opportunity for both countries, and in Australia's case, a chance to engage at this critical level when the Thai economy is booming. Thailand represents our second largest South East Asian market. With the fastest market growth in ASEAN and a rapidly developing market, Thailand is an ideal partner for Australia The FTA provides for preferential treatment for Australian companies and brings opportunities in sectors important to Australia. This is particularly the case for primary producers, manufacturers, service providers & investors, It assists in removing regulatory challenges previously a barrier to effective trade engagement. Mr Riley advised that its scope was very broad and included Trade in Goods; Customs Procedures: Rules of Origin; Safeguards to Protect Industries: SPS Measures & Food Standards; Industrial Technical Barriers to Trade: Trade in Services, Investment & Movement of People: Electronic Commerce: Competition Policy; Intellectual Property: Transparent Administration of Laws: Government Procurement; General Exceptions: Institutional Provisions: and Consultations & Dispute Settlement. The key sectors of opportunity for Australia are Agribusiness: Automotive; Consumer Products; Defence; Education & and Communications Technology; Infrastructure/Building & Construction: Legal Services and Marine. Within those sectors the scope for growth is enormous. Mr Riley outlined the market characteristics of each sector, provided strategies and insights into developing a presence in each sector and identified potential opportunities in each area. There are also current success stories to illustrate the possibilities for business. One of the most important aspects of this briefing was the identification of the basic requirements for Australian business to do well in Thailand, and indeed, regionally. It is important to have a real interest in the country; to develop real relationships that withstand the test of time, distance, cultural and language barriers. It is important to understand and work within the demands of the Thai market, and to present a consistent engaged corporate face to Thailand. These elements will all go toward effective participation in the trade relationships between the two countries. A matter of concern raised at the embassy briefing related to Australia's share of the education market in Thailand, and in particular post graduate education. This has traditionally been a strong area for Australia, and indeed we were Thailand's largest education provider in 2003. However in recent times there has been a shift of interest to the United Kingdom, and single year Masters degree courses. This is an issue I will continue to monitor. 4 38 Following our briefing at the embassy, Senator Mason and I were joined by the Ambassador in a meeting with Dr Borwornsak Uwanno, the Secretary General to the Thai Cabinet. I had met the Secretary General on a previous visit to Bangkok as a participant in the Centre for Democratic Institutions programme with Thailand. Much of the discussion centred on the challenges presented to the Thai government by the tsunami tragedy, and the urgent need for restoration and rehabilitation for the affected people and indeed, the environment. Australia's assistance was also canvassed in this discussion. Given the government was in election mode, much usual activity at the Cabinet level was also affected by this. However Dr Borwomsak did provide some insight into a number of law reform matters currently on the agenda in Thailand. In my role on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, law reform is an area of ongoing interest and regional comparisons are important for the committee, particularly in light of greater security and law enforcement cooperation. Indeed, the Committee met recently in Canberra with representatives of a Malaysian Parliamentary Select Committee to discuss similar matters. Although curtailed by circumstance, this brief visit to Thailand did provide useful insights into Australia's relationship currently, and its ongoing potential for development. I will maintain my interest in these matters, in particular in relation to law enforcement, security issues and trade development under the FTA rubric. 5 CAMBODIA This study visit is my second opportunity to visit Cambodia in a parliamentary capacity in recent years. On the first occasion I was a participant in the Centre for Democratic Institutions programme of engagement with the Cambodian Senate. On this occasion, I was interested to pursue Australia's activities in Cambodia, with particular reference to broad human rights issues, governance, aid and development, HIV/AIDS and security and law enforcement issues. With the valuable assistance of Australia's Ambassador to Cambodia HE Ms Lisa Filipetto and her team in Phnom Penh this was a very effective and useful visit. In addition to the formal programme of meetings and briefings, the Ambassador hosted several working lunches with key groups in Phnom Penh which assisted in ensuring that a broad range of discussions continued throughout the week. These included a lunch meeting with the Australian Alumni Association of Cambodia (AAA-C), an organisation of eminent Cambodian citizens from government, academia, medicine and other areas whose experience of Australia stems from their days as students in our major cities. Also, the Ambassador hosted lunch with volunteers from Australian Volunteers International and Australian Youth Ambassadors, working in very diverse roles in Cambodia, from 'Save Cambodia's Wildlife' to an Organic Market Support Officer at the Srer Khmer Organisation. In a final working lunch, guests were drawn from Australian business representatives in Cambodia, and in particular the Australian Business Association of Cambodia. The opportunity to hear at first hand about the development of the Cambodian market and the engagement of Australians in a new and emerging business environment was very valuable. Business representatives were drawn from the legal profession, banking, education, service providers and pharmaceutical companies amongst others. These functions are a very useful tool for informal and productive discussion on the Australia-Cambodia relationship, and importantly to hear the views of expatriate Australians, both short and long term, of working in Cambodia and their perspective on Australia's efforts to engage in this country. Australia Day This visit also occurred over Australia Day, which was celebrated with a well attended function in Phnom Penh. This is the first occasion on which I have had the opportunity to attend an Australia Day event hosted by an Australian mission. I was impressed to see the wide range of Cambodian and international guests from all sectors of the community, including the royal family, the diplomatic service, government and parliament, the military and law enforcement, business, academia and the legal profession, non government organisations and charitable organisations to name several. 6 40 Similarly, expatriate Australians were present in large number and were, to a person, enthusiastic advocates of the Australia-Cambodia relationship and its great potential. Many Australians are working in the Cambodian government and non government sectors, and Australian Youth Ambassadors were well represented. I was pleased to reacquaint myself with people I had met before in East Timor and in Indonesia, for example. Australian Volunteers International (AVI), an organisation with which I have had much contact through the Human Rights Sub Committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and which works closely with AusAlD in many of its endeavours, has a number of placements in Cambodia, many of whom attended the Australia Day event. Australia also has a developing business presence in Cambodia and there is a growing Australian Business Association of Cambodia. Business representatives from a range of areas were also present at the Australia Day event, and later in the week provided a briefing on their activities in Cambodia and the related challenges and opportunities. Celebration of our national day provides a valuable opportunity to both showcase Australia and to pay tribute to the relationship between nations. It was evident from the warm response to the remarks of Ambassador Filipetto, and the response of His Royal Highness, that the Australia/Cambodia relationship is a valued and important one in Phnom Penh. Country Briefing This study visit provided an opportunity to receive a broad country briefing from Australia's mission on key issues in the relationship and recent activities. The Australia-Cambodia relationship has been developing over many years. 2005 marks 50 years of resident Australian diplomatic presence in Phnom Penh, an important milestone. As another example, for over a decade, Australia has been providing English language training to the Cambodian defence force. As Australia's engagement in the region develops further and further, issues of regional integration and Cambodia's position in terms of ASEAN and regional trade agreements achieve some prominence. Australia watches with interest the relationships between countries in the region, including Cambodia, with China. For Cambodia also, the relationships with Thailand and Vietnam are highly dynamic, and economically vital. As globalisation rolls on, the benefits of regional integration in particular, offer some protection to smaller states like Cambodia. It is important to note that counter terrorism efforts are an Australian priority, and as an issue it is prominent in the Australia-Cambodia relationship. It involves working with all relevant agencies of the Cambodian government in either awareness raising or capacity building. Australia has been supporting the development of counter terrorism legislation in Cambodia as a high priority and in February 2005 a team from the Department of the Attorney General 7 41 was due in Cambodia to further that assistance. The Prime Minister Hun Sen has made recent announcements on the establishment of a counter terrorism committee. It is hoped that initiative will assist in progressing the signing of international counter terrorism instruments and other work in this area. Developments in counter terrorism are of great interest in my work on the Senates Legal and Constitutional Committee and ones which I will continue to observe with interest. In defence terms, our programme focus is on English language training and infrastructure development, including class rooms and buildings, communications initiatives, fitness equipment and relationship building with the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. Cambodian officers also visit Australia on defence exchanges. Our AFP presence in Cambodia includes two police liaison officers at the embassy and participation in the Transnational Crime Team (TCT). Australia is the only country with an international law enforcement officer on the ground in Cambodia. The priorities in the Law Enforcement Cooperation Programme with Cambodia are narcotics, counter terrorism and child sex tourism. In relation to counter terrorism, our emphasis is on training local police, and awareness raising. There is also a focus on domestic terrorism challenges given the arrest of individuals connected with the Bali bombing in Cambodia. The Australian mission in Cambodia also deals with border and immigration issues, and has three locally based Immigration officials. After years of conflict and internal disruption, integrity of documents is an ongoing problem. In many parts of the country, for births, deaths and marriages few legitimate historical records are available. Australia assists in capacity building through the Enhanced Migration Management Programme which concentrates on English language training, development of information technology skills, and immigration officer training. This will also include the development of a computer network for the relevant agencies within the constraints currently faced by the Cambodian public sector. From AusAlD's perspective, Australia's focus is on poverty reduction in our work in Cambodia. This includes addressing governance and structural issues and the inherent problems flowing from administrative corruption at many levels in Cambodia. One of the most extreme examples of this corruption concerned children paying a low paid teacher a fee to come to classes, and then learning so little that they pay again for after school classes. This is replicated in the health system, with most of the payments going to the bureaucracy in Phnom Penh, not even remaining in the provinces. Australia's attention to governance issues, and the importance of public sector, and legal and judicial reform are key aspects of our work in Cambodia. AusAlD still carries out direct service delivery in Cambodia, including our long term involvement in agriculture, and our work in the criminal justice area, in crime prevention and community safety. 8 42 In recent times Australia has been a leader in donor coordination, working with countries including the US, UK, France, Japan and Korea to develop a single approach to anti corruption and legal and judicial reform. Our humanitarian work centres on the mine action programme and food aid through the World Food Programme. We also support private sector development as a force for growth and development in the country. This comprehensive country brief provided a valuable basis for the specific visits and meetings of the study visit, and a better understanding of Australia's relationship with Cambodia. 9 43 Law and Justice In visiting the Transnational Crime Team (TCT) I was provided with a very useful opportunity to see this project of the Australian Federal Police and the Cambodian Police at close quarters. The goal of the TCT is to effect criminality offshore before it becomes a problem for Australia. The team is comprised of seven Cambodian officers sponsored by the AFP, with an Australian AFP member embedded in their team. The AFP member does not have an operational role but rather acts in an advisory capacity. The TCT is supported with premises, equipment, transport and English language training in a programme which has been in place since late 2002. It was noted during the briefing that the TCT has had some success with narcotic operations in recent times in the face of difficult circumstances. In particular, movement of drugs is exacerbated by weak border controls and corrupt behaviour at some levels. The briefing also provided timely and very interesting operational information about current cases and demonstrated some of the more recent achievements of the team. It was an effective demonstration of the work of the TCT, taking it out of the parliamentary committee briefing environment into the very real world of evidence collection and disruption of drug related illegal activity. Senator Payne and Senator Mason. with AFP Liaison officers and members of the Tansnational Come Team Phnom Pent, January 24. 2005 44 AusAlD also supports the Cambodia Criminal Justice Assistance Project (CCJAP), currently in Phase II. To further understanding of this Project a visit was arranged to the Prey Sar prison for women and juveniles, just outside Phnom Penh. The basic premise of the Project, which has been operating since 1997, is to develop improvements in the delivery of criminal justice services in Cambodia. It began at a time when there were no police, court or prison procedures and minimal human rights training. The Project has succeeded in joining government, donors and non government organisations in their work in this area. The Australian Team Leader is Mr Bob Bradley, formerly a long term member of the Australian Federal Police with a strong background in Cambodia and a real appreciation of the importance of the work and the challenges facing the Project. The current prison population comprises 364 individuals, including 174 adult women (two of whom are pregnant, 8 of whom have infant children), 190 under 16 years of age, and 45 foreign prisoners (Vietnamese and Thai). The Director General of the prison, Mr Samkol Sokun, advised that some of the major challenges facing the prison included a critical water shortage which effected the whole of the prisons operations. Female prisoners are trained in sewing but were facing a lack of material with which to do this in recent times. Funds were being sought to address both these problems, as well as the enlargement of the family visit house, and other construction assistance around the prison. On inspection, the prison, although utilitarian, seemed to be functional. The inmates, although clearly not happy at their incarceration, appeared to be in a reasonable state. I was advised that previous methods of shackling the prisoners had been abandoned. Juvenile offenders, several imprisoned for very serious offences, were separated from the female prisoners and their children. The prison had a large kitchen, medical room and education and sewing areas. Separate from the prison, the Project has achieved in several other important areas. Trainers in the National Police, the Ministry of Justice and the Prison system have been trained in internationally accredited courses and have been provided with nationalised standard materials for training. In the Central Department of Criminal Police, much work has been carried out in strengthening procedures, structures and investigations capacity including in the areas of anti-trafficking, child protection, child sexual exploitation and community safety. The work of the Project in fact resulted in the establishment of the Anti Trafficking Department, and it provides on going support to the director and management. The Project has also assisted in the introduction of important procedures in the Ministry of Justice and the Courts generally. Similarly, achievements in the Prisons Department include the implementation of National Procedures including specific articles addressing the needs of women and children, and 11 .1 the introduction of a strategic plan, a corrections management system and a prisoner classification system. Mr Bradley also provided advice on the future activities of the CCJAP Phase Il, with particular emphasis on capacity strengthening in government to provide improved health/medical and prisoner rehabilitation services. Attached is a copy of the Corrections Management System processes, detailing the focus on health/behaviour, the vocational education aspect, the work industry programme and the reintegration release programme. These are all important initiatives in the Cambodian justice system, and the result of very effective work by the participants in the CCJAP. 12 46 Aid and Development One of the very valuable aspects of this study visit was the opportunity to inspect aid and development projects outside Phnom Penh, in a visit to Prey Veng province. This type of visit, to AusAlD projects in the field, enables me to see, at first hand, the nature of projects that are considered at length in the parliamentary environment, particularly in the work of the Human Rights Sub Committee of the JSCFADT. This does give an important perspective to our parliamentary roles which it is impossible to achieve from the confines of a committee room or to derive from a briefing paper. The first of the two projects visited was a CARE programme, 'Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation - Living Above the Floods', funded by AusAlD. The briefing commenced in Preak Khsay village and was followed by a visit to a community meeting and Participatory Risk Assessment in Cham Village, Cham Commune, Kampong Trabaek District. Information on the project was provided at a meeting attended by a representative of the Cambodian National Committee for Disaster Management, members of the Prey Veng Committee for Disaster Management and several counterparts from government authorities, CARE Cambodia's Assistant Country Director Brian Agland and Felicity Pascoe Australian Youth Volunteer. The briefing was presented by Mr Noel Puno, Project Coordinator for CARE Cambodia. The basis of the project, established after the 2000 floods, is to support Prey Veng province with emergency relief, food security programming and disaster preparedness. As a result, the Prey Veng Disaster Preparedness Action Planning Project was implemented by CARE between early 2001 and 2003. As an overriding consideration, it was noted that it is imperative for effective response and containment, the national government needs to implement a national policy on disaster management. Of great interest in this project was the focus on bottom-up disaster preparedness action planning (DPAP) at commune, district and provincial levels, known as 'local solutions to local problems'. The project was intended to build the capacity of local authorities and villagers to identify, implement and monitor appropriate forms of disaster mitigation and preparedness measures. The DPAP model comprises three main elements - Mitigation Action Planning; Preparedness Action planning; and Disaster Mitigation through Savings. The Action Plans, which included repairs of farm to market roads, dams, irrigation canals, bridges and schools, resulted in increased rice yield and improved access to goods and services. The main projects under the Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation - Living Above the Floods programme included family safety hills, flood proofing of houses, raised platforms for animals and fodder, family evacuation boats, bicycle provision, home gardens, fishing implements, wells and water jars. 13 47 It was inspiring to see a strongly grounded, AusAlD supported, community project like this with young Khmer village women in such positions, delivering tangible results. From time to time, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee and the Human Rights Sub Committee of the JSCFADT explore with AusAlD, Australian funded aid and development projects in the region; canvassing the role of women, the outcomes of the projects and often the proportion of 'local ownership'. The opportunity to see this project 'in action' addressed many of those regular questions, and provided insight into some of the effective approaches adopted in achieving project outcomes. Attending the Participatory Risk Assessment community meeting was a highlight of this visit. Held in a community building, with hundreds of attendees, the discussion in Khmer (our interpreters were very helpful) engaged many of the local community in these important matters. Presentations were made, and discussion led by several community leaders. That community leadership included young women from the local villages and represented a real benchmark for me in many of the local projects I have seen in the region. Presentation of Participatory Risk Assessment at comrrunty meeting i n Cham Village. 25 Jafloary 2005 The second provincial visit covered a number of locations in Prey Verrg, meeting beneficiaries of the Prey Verrg Rehabilitation Centre in Chong Boeng village, Sieng Khavieng commune, Kamchay Mear District. AusAlD is a primary donor to Veterans International Cambodia (VIC), which was established in 1991 as the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation. Our visit was hosted by Hing Channarith, Country Director of VIC. The briefing advised 14 48 Noodle making business of vic beneficiary. funded through AusJO, Prey yang province, 26 January 2005 4') 15 that VIC has expanded over the last ten years to include a national rehabilitation centre, two regional centres and an income generating project. VIC provides assistance to war victims, and to people incapacitated from injuries caused by anti personnel mines and unexploded ordinance. I also noted the Centre provided support for children with disabilities and victims of road trauma and similar accidents. The rehabilitation centre employs 14 technical staff in its production of prostheses and other mobility devices, and runs a treatment centre that provides gait training for amputees and physical therapy among other services. Our inspection included meeting with patients attending therapy, meeting the infant children and visiting the classroom of the older students learning to write in spite of their disabilities, and a tour of the production unit. The visit also included meetings with several recipients of VIC support, whose injuries had previously prevented them participating in work and often family and community activities. In particular we met a noodle maker and his family, for whom the support of VIC had made a significant difference. Previously living in poverty, now with support from VIC to start his small business, a prosthetic leg and the engagement of his family, his home is the centre of noodle making and purchasing in the village community. Through interpreters we leamed that his children had been able to return to school, he could now make a living to support his family and he was well engaged in the community. With a simple programme of support and rehabilitation, a person who had long been marginalised was able to re-develop his life in a productive manner. In Phnom Penh I was pleased to make a repeat visit to the AusAlD supported organisation Friends International (Mith Samlanh), The Street Children Network. The International Coordinator of Mith Samlanh, Sebastien Marot is a long term advocate of support and engagement with the street children on Phnom Penh, for those that wish to seek support and change their lives, and his efforts and those of the organisation have been recognised internationally. The Australian Government has supported Friends since 1996. On this occasion the purpose of the meeting was to be briefed on and visit the Friends Day Care Centre for Children Affected by HIV/AIDS at Sihanouk Hospital in Phnom Penh. Friends is supported by AusAlD in their work with children with HIV and affected by HIV. This may mean one or both of their parents is HIV positive and they are facing the imminent loss of that parent and a fundamental and devastating shift in their life circumstances. The need for primary health care for themselves or a family member may have brought them to the city, away from their home and extended family and increased the isolation already caused by the presence of HIV in their world. The Day Care Centre assists in providing that vital emotional support to children who are facing illness and the imminent loss of a parent to HIV. The project also extends support by identifying services including home care for infected children or their parents, the placement of orphaned children and vocational training for older children to hopefully prevent them ending up on the streets with the 10 000 other street children in Phnom Penh. This was an extremely emotional and challenging briefing. It certainly serves to emphasise the total isolation for children in Cambodia facing a future without one or both parents after HIV has wrought its toll, and in a country where the problem of homeless children is already more than can be met. I have spent many regional visits examining HIV/AIDS initiatives supported by AusAlD. AusAlD has also provided countless briefings on this subject to the committees of which I am a member. Australia's commitment to fighting the pandemic in this region and to supporting countries trying to address the issues within their own communities is very important. It is no better exemplified than in our support for the children in this project. I trust it continues. Outside Phnom Penh, I visited the Sunrise Orphanage, run by expatriate Australian, Geraldine Cox AO. Although receiving considerable publicity in Australia I had not previously visited the Orphanage or met Ms Cox. The children of the orphanage gave a wonderful presentation of Cambodian cultural performances which Ms Cox advised would be part of their presentation on a visit to Australia later this year. The visit comprised a tour of the orphanage, including its education facilities, accommodation, kitchen, laundry and bathroom areas, and meeting with some of the children. Ms Cox expanded on some of her plans for the home and her determination to ensure the children are well educated and equipped to enter life as young adults in Cambodia, to seek employment or pursue study notwithstanding the challenging start they may have had in life. 16 io Sunnse Orphanage, cultural presentation by children 27 January 2005 I understand that Sunrise relies greatly on individual and corporate support from Australia and elsewhere, as well as government support. Ms Cox is clearly addressing a real need to protect vulnerable children in Cambodia and the Sunrise Orphanage and its counterpart in Siem Reap play a major role in changing the lives of children who are part of this extended family'. 17 Parliamentary Engagement A formal meeting with the President of the Cambodian Senate, Samdech Chea Sim provided an opportunity to further emphasise the importance of Australia-Cambodia links, in particular those from parliament to parliament. The President also commented on the progress of laws required to establish an electoral process for the election of the Senate, indicating that they were in development. An interesting and detailed meeting was also held with members of the Senate's Foreign Affairs (Commission V) and Human Rights (Commission I) Committees. The chair of each committee was present and the meeting was convened by Her Excellency Mme Ty Borasy, Chair of Committee V. The Chair of Committee I is Her Excellency Mme Men Maly. The Senators present included Mme Chhouk Chim, Sen Tith Ream, Sen Chhit Kim Yeat, HRH Sisowath Sinrath and Sen Chea Kim. The major issues for discussion included an exploration of the differences between committee structures and roles in our two Senates. It is very clear that this is overwhelmingly a question of resources, experience and committee development in Cambodia. My Cambodian colleagues welcomed the developing activity of their committees, including the role they described as examining and monitoring implementation of legislation, and the opportunities it provided to meet the people of their country as they go about their work. The Senators noted that the Commission structure is still young, and as previously mentioned suffers from a lack of experience and a lack of skilled assistance in particular. Activity of the commissions is published in a report. The Senators noted that their Commissions worked closely together, notwithstanding the fact that members were from different parties. Mme Men Maly advised that Commission I monitors and examines complaints on human rights issues. The Commission conducts investigations and informs the relevant authority and institutions of breaches. I was advised that in 2004 the Commission examined 132 complaints. Each of the Senators reinforced the need for support and assistance from the Australian Senate, with particular reference to publications of human rights information, human rights training and the development of a more formal exchange process between the parliaments. I note that laws to determine the process for election of the Cambodian Senate have still to be brought to the Parliament. The term of the Senate was extended in 2004 and seems set to be so again this year. The Cambodia Daily commented on this matter in its edition of January 25, 2005 \"Senate to extend its own mandate - Again\". 18 This particular meeting reinforced the value of our well developed Senate committee experience and activity. On my previous visit to Cambodia with the Centre for Democratic Institutions this was a major aspect of our discussions. It is clear that there is room for significantly more engagement and I will pursue this aspect of the visit with colleagues. In addition it provided an opportunity to compare and contrast the work of the Human Rights Sub Committee of the JSCFADT with Commission I in the Cambodian Senate. 19 Human Rights issues Several meetings of the visit covered human rights issues in Cambodia, in general in a roundtable discussion with key human rights groups, a meeting with the Country Representative of the UN Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (COHCHR), Ms Margo Picken and also a briefing from Janet Ashby. the Project Director of the Regional Anti Trafficking project. Each of these meetings covered matters addressed in both formal and informal work of the Human Rights Sub Committee of the JSCFADT and provided a valuable perspective on that work. I am also hoping to visit the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva this year in my capacity as Chair of the Sub Committee, and value the information I received from the NGO group and the Country Representative of the UN Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in advance of this visit. The roundtable included the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights, the Community Legal Education Centre, the Centre for Social Development, the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association and the Peace and Development Institute. Each organisation made a brief presentation on their individual activities, and their combined efforts as NGOs in the human rights area. The group provided me with a very useful source document, the NGO Statement to the 2004 Consultative Group Meeting on Cambodia, which sets out comprehensively their history, their work and specific areas of activity. The document was prepared for those external groups seeking to contribute to poverty reduction in Cambodia. Of particular concern in recent times is the reported crackdown of authorities on gathering and demonstrations, particularly in Phnom Penh. The challenges are enormous, and the fortitude that is required to be an active leader in an NGO in Cambodia is not lost on me. It is personally demanding, perhaps dangerous on occasion, and exhausting to advocate for rights and freedoms in a country where the nation's recent history is written in the language of repression and violence. I commend their efforts and look forward to an ongoing relationship with such organisations where possible. Discussions with Ms Picken, the Country Representative of the UN Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights centred on the recent work of the Office and also this years Commission on Human Rights session in Geneva. The work of the Special Representative, previously a role held by Justice Michael Kirby of the High Court was also discussed. At the end of 2004 the Special Representative of the Secretary General for human rights in Cambodia Mr Peter Leuprecht, concluded his 11th mission. He held meetings with a range of government and non government representatives, the international community and Cambodian citizens. His report focussed on land concessions for economic purposes from a human rights perspective. Ms Picken also canvassed some of the history of the office, both during and since the UNTAC period. 20 Australia has been developing comprehensive anti people trafficking initiatives over the last 2 years and Cambodia is a key country in the region where challenges have been identified. Key aspects of the briefing included the use of children in a variety of extreme ways in both trafficking and smuggling of goods. As noted earlier, Cambodia has very porous borders; this does exacerbate the capacity for trafficking activity and simultaneously increases the challenge of stopping the activity. This is an area in which the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee has spent much time in discussion with both the Department of the Attorney General and the Australian Federal Police. The regional networks include trafficking to Malaysia through Thailand, by networks including Cambodians and Thais; and the trafficking of Chinese children to Laos using Cambodian traffickers. As advised in the briefing, the Project's goal is to assist in the prevention of people trafficking by developing a more coordinated and effective approach by the criminal justice systems of governments in the region. In Cambodia the partnership members are the Ministry of Justice, court officials, the Ministry of Interior and Victim Support Agencies. The focus is also on training judges and prosecutors specifically to assist them in developing strategies to deal with trafficking, and to improve relationships and cooperation between police and the courts. The project is also assisting in building relations between the justice system and victim support agencies. It is a part of a broader regional initiative which involves offices in Thailand, Laos and Myanmar. The challenges in combating people trafficking in Cambodia include continuing to support partners during difficult cases with impunity issues, and also the impact on the court system, which like many aspects of the legal system requires significant improvement. Summary Thanks in large measure to the generous assistance of HE Ambassador Lisa Filipetto and her professional team in Cambodia, this was a very useful study visit. In all of my committee activity, including the foreign affairs defence and trade, human rights and legal and constitutional committees, I consider the practical work of our agencies in places like Cambodia in a theoretical mariner. The opportunity to meet with, attend visits and be briefed by those doing the work on the ground provides a real perspective to that parliamentary work. I express my thanks to all those who assisted in making this study visit so valuable, both in the Australian mission and members of the Cambodian community and government.

Confirmation of purpose a. The purpose of this visit was to: The purpose of my visit to Indonesia was to gain a first-hand understanding of the international recovery effort taking place in the aftermath of the Boxing Day Tsunami. This was critical in enabling me to more effectively fulfil my role as the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Security. In Jakarta I was able to meet with a range of high-level Indonesian Government officials who were directly involved in the recovery effort, including Foreign Minister Hassan Wirauda, Defence Minister Juwono Sudarsono and Minister for National Development Planning, Sri Mulyani Indrawati. I was also able to meet with representatives of some of the principal aid agencies involved in the short and long-term reconstruction of the affected areas. This included meetings with Bo Asplund, UN Resident 653 to Indonesia, Mohamed Saleheen, Country Director, World Food Program, and Joel Boutroue, UN coordinator for relief operations, Banda Aceh. In addition to a heavy schedule in Jakarta, I was able to visit the worst-affected areas of Aceh and Medan and speak to Indonesian Government officials on the ground, members of the UN relief operation, aid agencies and the Australian organizations assisting in the recovery effort. This trip was crucial in enabling me to examine the short, medium and long-term challenges that Indonesia confronts in recovering from the Tstmanu. It was also important to gauge first-hand what level of external assistance Indonesia would need from Australia and the international community. b. Itinerary (see attached). After arriving in Jakarta I received a substantial briefing at the Australian Embassy with a number of officials with direct involvement in the coordination of Australia's contribution to the recovery effort. These officials included Ms Penny Burtt, Minister Counsellor, Brigadier Ken Brownrigg, Head of Australian Defence Staff, Mr Graeme Swift, Minister-Counsellor (Consular and Administration) and Mr Robin Davies, Minister-Counsellor (Development Cooperation). Accompanied by Australian Ambassador David Ritchie, I then met with Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda. We discussed with the Foreign Minister various aspects of Indonesia's response to the recovery effort. We also discussed the security situation in Aceh and the best provisioning of security for foreign workers in Aceh, both military and civilian. In addition, we spoke about Australia's contribution to the recovery effort and the contribution of the international community. I met with Dr Juwono Sudarsono, Minister for Defence, along with Ambassador Ritchie and Brigadier Brownrigg, to discuss Australia's response to the aid effort. Dr Sudarsono spoke favourably about the Australian Defence Force's contribution to the recovery effort, as well as Australia's civil aid effort through AusAID. We also discussed the international military presence in Aceh. In the afternoon I met separately with Mr Bo Asplund, UN Resident Representative to Indonesia and Mr Oliver Lacey-Hall, Team Leader, United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) as well as Mr Mohamed Saleheen, Country Director, World Food Program. Both meetings 61 provided me with an opportunity to learn more about the aid program underway in Aceh and Medan. We also addressed in detail Australia's aid package and its delivery to the affected areas. On the Tuesday morning I met with Major General Usman Basjah, Assistant Secretary and Deputy for National Defence, Inspector General Demak Lubis, Deputy for National Security in the Office of the Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs (POLHUKAM) and H.E. Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Minister for National Development Planning. These meetings were very useful in enabling me to better understand the Indonesian Government's response to the Tsunami and the varying responsibilities of each Department. It was also important to discuss the areas where the Australian Government could make an effective contribution in supporting the Indonesian Government's response to the recovery effort. I then had a meeting with Mr Then Sanibuaga (Golkar Party), Chairman of Parliamentary Commission I (Foreign Affairs, Security and Information) and Commission I members Mr Sidarto Danusubroto, Deputy Chairman Comniisson 1, Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), Mr Muhammad AS Hikam, National Awakening Party (P1(B) and Mr Azuris Hassan, PDI-P. At meeting we discussed, among other things, the response of the political parties to the disaster. In the evening I saw Mr Joel Boutroue, UN coordinator for relief operations, Banda Aceh. We were able to discuss the coordination and distribution of aid on the ground in Aceh. Mr Boutroue also informed me of the contribution in Aceh being made by AusAiD and other Australian aid agencies. Amongst other meetings on the Wednesday, I found it very useful to be briefed by Brigadier Dave Chalmers, Commander, Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) 629, and also to tour the CJTF operations centre. Given the coordinating role of CJTF 629 this was an excellent opportunity to see first hand how the Indonesian military was responding to the Tsunami across the archipelago. My meetings on the Wednesday night included the chance to speak with Mr Michael Stevens (Australian Honorary Consul, Medan), Ms Lisa Roberts (AusAID Relief Coordinator, Medan), Mr Lockton Morrissey (AusAlD disaster relief consultant) and CJTF personnel. This meeting was invaluable as it gave me the opportunity to hear from Australian officials what contribution our country was making on the ground in Aceh and Medan. I was also able to discuss the long-term role of Australia in the affected areas. It was fortunate that I was in Jakarta at the same time as an international conference was being held on infrastructure. President Susio Bambang Yudhoyono addressed that conference and made plain his interest in 62 attracting Australian investment and Australian assistance, together with assistance from and around the international community, in rebuilding his country's infrastructure. Given the enormous amount of infrastructure that was destroyed by the Tsunami and other infrastructural problems around Indonesia, I was able to address the outcomes of this conference in many of my meetings. In particular, I was able to explore the areas where Indonesian officials believe there may be a role for Australia to play in the rebuilding of Indonesian infrastructure. Visiting Aceh and Medan was invaluable. I was able to see first-hand the destruction caused by the Tsunami and the devastated communities it left behind. In Aceh, I met with Major General Bambang Darmono, Head of TN! Relief Operations in Aceh where we spoke about the role of the TNI in the relief effort and the TNI's interaction with international aid groups. We discussed the mammoth task the TNI faced in providing shelter, food, water and sanitation for Banda Aceh and, of course, the horrific task of tending to the dead. I visited the AL)F medical team at Banda Aceh General Hospital. The team was doing a first-class job and many people that I spoke to on the ground were openly appreciative of their presence. I also visited the ADF engineering team, which was undertaking sanitation work at IDP camp. Again, the role of the engineering team could not be understated. I was able to meet and talk with the AusAJD consultants at AusAlD staff residence about the needs of the Aceh and Medan residents. This was an excellent opportunity to address the Australian Government's aid package and where officials thought the monies could best be used. My visit to the Australian civilian medical team at the White Hospital (led by Dr Hugh Granton) provided another chance to see up dose Australia's contribution to the recovery effort. Conclusion The recovery effort in Indonesia will continue for years - and Australia will play a leading role within the international community's response. My visit to Indonesia, and the most affected areas of Banda Aceh and Medan, was therefore important as it enabled me to gain a first-hand understanding of the international recovery effort taking place in the aftermath of the Boxing Day Tsunami. I was able to address critical aspects of the recovery effort in Indonesia with the Indonesian Foreign Minister and Defence Minister, senior Indonesian Government officials involved in the recovery effort as well as the principal aid agencies involved in the short and long-term reconstruction of the affected areas. I was also able to examine what Australia's long-term role will be in the recovery effort. 63 I am more than happy to elaborate on any of the points above. I understand that knowingly giving false and misleading information is a serious offence. Yours sincerely : Kevin Rudd, MP Federal Member for Griffith Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Security 64 SENATOR BRETT MASON 3 March 2005 Senator the Hon Eric Abetz Special Minister of State Suite MG 50 Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 Dear Minister, In accordance with the requirements of Clause 9.2 (b) of Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 14 of 2003, I submit the following statement reporting on my recent overseas study journey. (i) (a) Confirmation of Purpose As Chairman of the Australia/Cambodia Parliamentary Friendship Group, and a member of the Australia Thailand Parliamentary Friendship Group I had originally intended to visit and study Thailand and Cambodia with Senator Manse Payne between Sunday 16 January 2005 and Sunday 30 January 2005. Due to the unforeseen tragedy of the tsunami striking East Asian nations including Thailand, the Australian Embassy in Thailand was unable to furnish me with a full program. However, the Embassy was able to organise two important meetings in Bangkok. Therefore the primary focus of my Study Tour was Cambodia. In Cambodia I examined the role of the Australian Federal Police, particularly as it related to people trafficking and the commercial sex trade; Australian Aid Programs (in particular the Cambodia Criminal Justice Assistance Project) and local health and education initiatives. Page 1 66 (b) Itinerary and Key Meetings Thursday 20 January 2005 11.00am Roundtable briefing by Ambassador Mr Bill Patterson and Senior Staff at Embassy in Bangkok regarding Australia's relationship with Thailand. Discussion centred upon Australia's leadership role in assisting Thai authorities in the wake of the tsunami disaster. Australian experience in disaster relief, particularly by members of the Australian Federal Police, were of considerable benefit to Thai authorities. Australian relations with Thailand are warm and our response to the tsunami crisis has deepened the relationship. It is fair to say that Australian diplomatic representatives were perhaps the most pro-active of all foreign nationals operating in the disaster zone. They were a credit to this nation. Australia's relationship with Thailand has been built on substantial and long standing Defence co-operation - including joint training, exercise and inter-operability. There is a long history of development assistance through AusAID, excellent co-operation on law enforcement, particularly with respect to drugs, people trafficking, prostitution and counter-terrorism. Australia is now the largest overseas provider of tertiary education for Thai students. There is increasing tourism in both directions. Moreover, Australia's warm relations with Thailand are reflected in the recent passing of the Australia-Thailand Free Trade Agreement. The Agreement creates enormous potential for Australian business. There is preferential treatment for Australian companies, particularly for our primary producers, manufacturers, service industry and investors. The Thai economy is growing quickly and offers a broad range of opportunities for Australian engagement with other ASEAN countries. While there are still some concerns (primarily quarantine matters) the Agreement has been warmly received by Thai and Australian business. 67 Page 2 1.00pm Lunch with Professor Borwornsak Uwanno, Secretary General to the Cabinet; Senator Manse Payne; Mr Bill Patterson, Australian Ambassador. Professor Uwanno thanked Australia for its significant assistance to the Thai relief effort in tsunami devastated regions of the country. In particular, he was concerned that Australian relief be directed to technical aspects of recovery where Thai officials and relief workers lacked expertise. Australia had helped significantly in the identification and preservation of bodies of people killed in the tsunami. Future Australian involvement might include assistance to rebuilding devastated beaches. Thai officials and relief workers have little experience in both these areas of expertise. In a wide ranging conversation Professor Uwanno outlined the future challenges for Thailand following the election shortly to he held (the Prime Minister, Thakain Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai Party was overwhelmingly re-elected). Professor Uwanno saw defence issues in Indo-China, health issues such as HIV Aids and religious tension in southern Thailand as three long-term issues for the Thai government. As an architect of the Thai Senate, Professor Uwanno was optimistic about the continuing development of that chamber - particularly the growth of specialist Senate committees. Friday 21 January 2005 Conversation with Pimuk Sirnaroj MP, Deputy Spokesman for the Thai Rak Thai Party. Discussion focussed on the forthcoming election, the presidential nature of Thai politics, the likelihood of a large majority for the Thai Rak Thai Party, and the consequences of this for Thai democracy. While, to the outsider Dr Thaksin appears as an untouchable and strong leader, and his government as part of a corporate State, Pimuk Simaroj said that appearances could be deceiving. He argued that capacity for frank discussion within the Thai Rak Thai Party was considerable. Thus he asserted, even in the event of a large government majority alter the election, the government would be held to account not only by the Opposition but also by pluralism within the governing party. Fly to Cambodia 68 Page 3 Saturday 22 January 2005 Arrive Phnom Pen from Bangkok - Fit TG690. Met by Embassy driver and taken to accommodation Monday 24 January 2005 8.30am Roundtable briefing by Ambassador, Ms Lisa Filzpetto and Embassy Staff. Major issues discussed \u00e2\u00a2 Great difficulties in establishing land ownership and therefore property rights in Cambodia \u00e2\u00a2 The constitutional requirement in Cambodia for a two-thirds majority to form government. While that may have been appropriate at the time of the first election in 1993 such a requirement may no longer serve the interests of good government in Cambodia. \u00e2\u00a2 While volunteers often see a large and homogenous Cambodian Peoples' Party (CPP) the CPP is highly factionalised around several key politicians including the Prime Minister Hun Sen and the President of the Senate Chea Sim. \u00e2\u00a2 In the wake of the tsunami in east and central Asia Cambodia hopes to build its tourism industry along the coast particularly in Sihanoukville which was untouched by the tsunami. \u00e2\u00a2 Cambodia wants the protection offered by regional and international organisations. \u00e2\u00a2 Australia is the third largest defence contributor after China and France. Australia's training of the Cambodian Military Forces is only in non-lethal areas. \u00e2\u00a2 Significant co-operation exists between the Australian Federal Police and the Cambodian Police Force in narcotic interdiction, counter-terrorism and child sex tourism. Narcotics are becoming a larger problem for Australia, particularly now that they are being mailed from Cambodia to Australia. There is a low capacity for counter-terrorism response among the Cambodian Army and Police forces. \u00e2\u00a2 There is little evidence of radical or terrorist elements among the Moslem (Chaim) minority in Cambodia. \u00e2\u00a2 Weak border controls have made Cambodia a target for drug importers and potentially for terrorist activity. \u00e2\u00a2 Poor co-operation among law enforcement agencies in Cambodia greatly lessens the effectiveness of law enforcement. This, coupled with corruption, both among police, public servants and Page 4 (,) p the judiciary, makes the fight against organised crime and terrorism very difficult. \u00e2\u00a2 In short, the most important issues facing Cambodia are the creation of structures of accountability of government and law enforcement agencies. Corruption is at the root of a corroding public service morale, judicial failure and political thuggery. The consensus seemed to be that effective accountability mechanisms will only arise when governments are forced to comply. While the growth of the private sector and the development of a middle class will lead to greater demand for government accountability and a growing democratic sentiment, this will not come easily or quickly. 11.00am Trans National Crime Team Centre Briefing and Tour The Australian Federal Police have developed a close relationship with Cambodian law enforcement agencies particularly in the areas of narcotics, counter-terrorism and child sex tourism. As luck would have it, in the week preceding our visit Cambodian Police uncovered a large narcotics trafficking network. On the very day of our arrival they procured further evidence against the traffickers and displayed this before us. The Australian Federal Police has performed admirably in assisting Cambodian law enforcement agencies with developing sound investigative, procedural and evidential techniques. 12.l5pm Lunch hosted by Ambassador at residence with Australian Alumni Association of Cambodia Committee An impressive array of Australian alumni including the Director of the Communicable Disease Control Project in Department of the Ministry of Health; the Director of the HIV Policy Project; the Assistant to the Secretary General of the Council for the Development of Cambodia; and the Chancellor of Cambodia's newest private university, attended the lunch. There is enormous goodwill among highly placed Cambodians for Australia and its people. With diplomatic relations with Cambodia now stretching over 50 years, with Australian being a primary mover of the Pans Peace Accord leading to the withdrawal of the Vietnamese from Cambodia and the first democratic elections in 1992, and with well-placed AusAID programs, Cambodia is an important diplomatic friend in the strategic heart of ASEAN. Pages 2.30pm Visit Prey Sar Women's and Juvenile Prison with Cambodian Criminal Justice Assistance Program I first visited Cambodian prisons in 1992 when I was working with the Human Rights Component of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. Conditions then were appalling - shackles, lack of food and water. Disease was common. Fortunately, conditions have much improved. While still harsh and overcrowded Cambodian prisoners today at least receive sufficient food and clean water. Most have access to health care and education. While not a happy place, the prison we visited had less an air of tension and aggression than prisons I have visited in Australia, Britain or the US. The AusAID program - The Cambodia Criminal Justice Assistance Project - has assisted enormously in reforming prison conditions. The implementation of national procedures including specific articles addressing the needs of women and children has been a huge step forward. So too has the development of a crisis management system and the prisoner classification system. Prison staff are now trained, able to administer basic first aid and have access to a career structure. The development of health standards guidelines in consultation with the Cambodian Ministry of Health and selected NGOs has improved personal health and helped manage the spread of contagious diseases, such as HIV Aids, other STDs and TB. Special provision has now been made for women and nursing mothers. It is a far cry from only a dozen years ago. AusAID are to be congratulated for their far-sighted work, particularly in this area which usually attracts little domestic attention. The plight of convicted criminals is not an issue with which most developing countries would be concerned. 6.30pm Dinner with Mr Maly Leng and Mrs Leng and Mr Vannary Ing and Mrs Ing of the United National High Commission for Human Rights, and their families, and Senator Payne. Discussion about current issues including human rights in Cambodia, particularly problems of developing a truly independent judiciary. Corruption, which seems endemic, cannot be countered until the development of an independent judiciary. While Mr Leng and Mr Ing believe that the protection of human rights has 71 Page 6 improved over the last twelve years since the departure of IJNTAC, real progress cannot be made until both law enforcement agencies, the parliament and the judiciary are relatively free of corruption. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights continues to attract criticism from the government. Paradoxically, both however believe that the criticism illustrates continuing success of the office. Tuesday 25 January 2005 8.30am Depart for Prey Veng Province to Observe AusAlD Project 9.00am Briefing at CARE office in Preak Khsay Village on disaster preparedness program activities Since the 2000 floods in Cambodia, CARE Cambodia has had a commitment to Prey Veng Province in the form of emergency relief, food security programming and disaster preparedness. This led to the passing of the Prey Veng Disaster Preparedness Action Planning Project (DPAP), funded by AusAID, and implemented by CARE between February 2001 and January 2003. DPAP established a new model for bottom up disaster preparedness action planning at commune, district and provincial levels in Cambodia consisting of three main elements: 1. Mitigation Action Planning and Implementation Communities developed their own mitigation plan to recover from previous floods/droughts and implemented these plans through small grants, in kind contributions and cash for work. Examples of work undertaken include road and canal bank upgrade, household and village safety hills and irrigation system construction. 2. Disaster Preparedness Action Planning and Implementation Communes and districts developed and implemented DPAP using small sub grants from the project. Examples of the use of such grants include the local road systems to support search and rescue efforts and procurement of boats for p evacuation. 3. Disaster Mitigation Through Savings To reduce household's vulnerability a commune based savings mobilisation scheme was initiated. Savings enabled households to accumulate cash and also access lower interest rate loans. Those savings and loans were available to 71 Page 7 households during flood periods and helped communities avoid the debt spiral normally exacerbated by disasters. This important AusAID project helps to: i) Increase the flood preparedness of the most vulnerable households; ii) Increase villager confidence in well targeted and transparent emergency response; and iii) Provide opportunity for increased food security for vulnerable households. The program is being implemented in collaboration with the Cambodian Government's National Committee of Disaster Management and will cover 20 villages from 6 communes in 2 districts of Prey Veng Province. 12.30pm Depart for Disaster Preparedness Site Visit in Chan Commune 2.00pm Visit Program Activities and meet with beneficiaries Following lunch in the commune we observed and participated in the preparation of a Disaster Management Plan for the commune. Much work had been done both by the CARE officials and by commune members to prepare a comprehensive and practical flood relief management program. Seemingly, all commune members participated; the old, the young and men and women. Indeed, the individual with primary responsibility for developing the commune plan was a woman. The result was impressive. First, because of the comprehensive nature of the plan. Secondly, because the villagers had largely developed the plan and had confidence in it. We then visited sites outside the commune where work had been done for preparation of future floods and were impressed by the commitment of both CARE officials and the community involved. 4.3Opm Depart for Prey Veng Provincial Town Page 8 O.00pm Dinner with implementation partners: Mr Brian Agland (CARE) and Mr Hing Chanrith (Veterans international) Mr Agland and Mr Chanrith both outlined the scope of their projects, the cost of their projects and the outcomes they had achieved and were hoping to achieve. I should note that AusAlD officials were scrupulous in their attention to cost and outcomes. Wednesday 26 January 2005 8.00am Depart hotel to visit benefwiaries of the Prey Veng Rehabilitation Centre in Chong Boeng Village, Sieng Khavieng commune, Kamchay Mear district, accompanied by Mr Hing Chanrith, Country Director, Veterans International The Prey Veng Rehabilitation Centre was established to provide assistance to war veterans and to people left debilitated by anti-personnel mines and unexploded ordinance. To provide these services at the Rehabilitation Centre there is a large workshop for the production of prostheses, wheel chairs, and other mobility devices as well as a treatment centre that provides training for amputees, physical therapy and surgical corrections. In the Veterans International National Rehabilitation Centre, and the two regional centres, over 11,000 patients have been served. Currently over 4,000 patients are being cared for at the Centres or in their communities. Community follow up teams visit patients in their homes to reinforce rehabilitation techniques and check equipment to see if repairs or replacement are needed. At the Prey Veng Centre there were 14 technical staff, and over 3,000 patients have been treated from the provinces of Prey Veng and Svey Reng since it opened in 1995. This project reflects what application, technical know how and just a little money can do for the lives of seriously disadvantaged people in a developing country. Those people who have lost limbs from land mines or unexploded ordinance have been given real hope and a second chance at an active life by the work of this centre. I fully commend the work being done. 74 Page 9 11.30am Depart for Phnom Penh 2.30pm Arrive Goldiana Hotel 6.l5pm Depart Goldiana Hotel for Inter-Continental Hotel and attend Australia Day reception I am grateful to the Ambassador for including Senator Payne and I in her formal welcome to dignitaries and diplomats at the Australia Day reception. Given that there were two Deputy Prime Ministers among many other ministers of the Cambodian Government, I think it is fair to say that Cambodia treats its relationship with Australia very seriously. Thursday 27 January 2005 8.00am COIL on Samdech Chea Sim, President of the Cambodian Senate I have met the President of the Senate on three prior occasions. While this call upon the President of the Senate is largely formal and ceremonial he recalled our previous meetings and displayed a joviality that I had never before seen! As always he was gracious and interested to learn Australia's view of Cambodia's progress. 8.45am Called on representatives of the Senate Foreign Affairs and Human Rights Committees, chaired by Her Excellency Senator Ty Borasy, Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. This was a roundtable discussion - on the one hand Senator Payne and I with Australia's Ambassador to Cambodia and diplomatic officials, and, on the other, selected representatives from the Cambodian Senate. This discussion was notable for its candour. While careful not to concede any wrong doing or lack of resolve by the Government it is clear issues of human rights, corruption, and land title will have to be solved before Cambodia could make significant progress. I was impressed by the sincerity of the Cambodian Senators' observations 7S Page 10 and only hope that their apparent goodwill and commitment translates into significant government and parliamentary action. 1O.l5am Depart for Friends/Mith Samlanh Main Training Centre 1O.80am Briefing and tour of Training Centre facilities by Sebastian Marot (Friends International Project Co-ordinator) and Ly Sophat (Program Director). An inspiration! Friends was established by Sebastien Marot in 1994 in response to the desperate needs of street children in Phnom Penh. AusAID is a major donor to Friends. Friends aims to reintegrate very needy children into society by reintegrating children back into their families and the public school system; supporting older children to find gainful employment; linking children with their culture and making them active citizens. Street children are a great challenge in every country including Australia, but the situation is far more dire in a developing country like Cambodia. In Phnom Penh children living and working on the streets are at high risk of violence from adults including gangs, police and mobs; health problems due to poor nutrition and dirty water; illnesses that include HIV Aids, typhoid and dengue fever; a harsh environment with heavy rain and scorching heat; and rape, kidnapping for the sex trade or domestic slavery. Friends supplies street children in Phnom Penh with food and shelter and medical care, education, protection from physical and sexual abuse. In a world where politicians talk perhaps too frequently about rights, there is one right that all children possess, and that is the right to hope. Friends makes hope possible for Cambodian street kids. 11.00am Travel to Sihanouk Hospital to Friends Day Care Centre for Children Affected by HIV Aids Depressing. 76 Page II We met children who were affected by HIV Aids in either of two ways. First, their parents were dead or dying of Aids. Secondly, they themselves had contracted HP! Aids. Friends work was principally with assisting children whose parents were dying. They did this by assisting children to stay in school or find work. In the case of children with HP! Aids little can be done without money. At best children could be made comfortable and relatively pain free. 12.l5pm Lunch at Friends Restaurant with Australian volunteers. Australian expatriots working in Cambodia are making a significant difference to the development of that country. Australians are working in fields of human rights, agricultural development, education, wildlife, land use planning, preservation of Cambodian artefacts, and projects against domestic violence. Australians are making an enormous contribution to the country. All of us share an admiration for Sebastien Marot and his Friends project. So successful has Friends been in assisting Cambodian street kids, the organisation is establishing operations in Laos, Burma, Vietnam and Honduras. 3.00pm Arrived Sunrise Orphanage. Tour by Geraldine Cox AO Again, inspirational! Ms Cox is no Dickensian character. Her enormous energy and great passion provides hundreds of Cambodian orphans with shelter, education, skills and hope. Ms Cox administers boys and girls and teenage men and women with a deft hand. She accomplishes a difficult task with great humour and commitment. Children in her care are very lucky indeed. 6.80pm Dinner hosted by Her Excellency Ty Borasy, Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs committee Broad-ranging discussion about the role of the Cambodian Senate and strengthening its functions and powers. Cambodian Senators expressed a belief that the Tribunal established to try certain Khmer Rouge operatives is necessary to purge Cambodia of the past. However, there was genuine delight expressed at the 77 Page 12 crowning of the new King who is seen very much as a figure of national unity. Friday 28 January 2005 9.0Oam Roundtable meeting with representatives of Cambodian Human Rights Non-Government Organisation - Dr Kek Galabru (LICADHO); Mr Chum Phally (Head of Advocacy Section, ADI-IOC); Chea Vannath (Centre for Social Development); Mr Nou Navath (Peace and Development Institute); Mr Yeng Virak (Community Legal Education Centre). I first met Dr Galabru, perhaps the most celebrated Human Rights Advocate in Cambodia, in 1992. She maintains the rage. She believes that the major human rights issues facing Cambodia are land title and land grabbing; arbitrary detention; false imprisonment; people trafficking; domestic violence; the state of prisoners (in particular, the separation of remand from convicted prisoners) and children in prisons. Human rights advocates argue that corruption is costing about one half of the national budget. The Government, they claim, would not even use the word \"corruption\" until after 1994, and only now begrudgingly acknowledge it is a profound problem. In essence, this group argues that cronyism is the seat of Cambodia's greatest problems. Whether it was corruption among politicians, the bureaucracy, the police, courts or any other institutions, it all stemmed from a political and cultural system based upon reciprocity and cronyism. Until that could be seriously addressed they argued, both human rights and the Cambodian economy will continue to suffer. 11.00am Visit Ms Margot Picken, Director of the United Nations Cambodia Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights Ms Picken directs the successor body that I worked for in 1992/93 - the Human Rights Component of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). Ms Picken welcomed the establishment of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal and believed that its performance would provide a measure of whether the international community would judge Cambodia's commitment to human rights and judicial independence. Ms Picken remained concerned about the slow development of the rule of law in Cambodia. While 78 Page 13 conceding that the protection of human rights have come a long way since UNTAC an indigenous appreciation of human rights had yet to take root in Cambodia. Foreign supervision and foreign assessment of human rights abuse would continue to be necessary. 12.30pm Lunch hosted by Ambassador with Australian business representatives The Australian business representatives were generally optimistic about the future for Australian business in Cambodia. Political stability had brought increased foreign investment and the Cambodian Government was genuinely interested in attracting further Australian businesses. However, this wish to attract investment had not always been accompanied by reform of important institutional protections, such as an independent legal system. The clash, on the one hand, between a government keen to attract business and, on the other, unwilling or unable to provide institutional certainty is unlikely to be solved in the near future. Nonetheless, business optimism is reflected in increasing Australian investment including the proposed opening of the first retail bank in Cambodia by the ANZ Banking Group. 2.30pm Meeting with Ms Janet Ashby, Project Director of Regional Anti-People Trafficking Project on trafficking issues in Cambodia. The goal of the project is to contribute to the prevention of people trafficking in south-east Asia. Its specific purpose is to facilitate a more effective and co-ordinated approach by the criminal justice systems of governments in the south-east Asia region to prevent people trafficking. This will improve victims' access to justice, increase security in society, and end impunity for people smugglers. The project commenced in March 2003 and is scheduled to run for three years. The initial focus of the project is on Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, and it is expected that project benefits will also flow to other ASEAN countries and China. The project: \u00e2\u00a2 Supports a specialised police response to trafficking \u00e2\u00a2 Strengthens the broader criminal justice response - in Cambodia this focus is on training judges and prosecutors on specific issues and strategies to deal with trafficking and improving co-operation between the police and the courts \u00e2\u00a2 Builds relations between the criminal justice system and proposes changes that support victims. In Cambodia this Page 14 includes facilitating the development of in-country agreements between the relevant Ministries and NGOs on procedures for co-operation, and Promotes regional co-operation; the project has offices also in Thailand, Laos and Myanmar and supports the development of regional specialist police co-operation procedures, broader regional Memoranda of Understanding and development of cross-border relations between victim support agencies that co-operate with the criminal justice system. A year into the project's implementation and early indications are a cause for optimism. But Ms Ashby was quick to point out that it was too early to assess outcomes and whether three years would be an adequate time in which to assess if the project had been a success. 4.00pm Meet with Mr Sam Rainsy MP (Head of Sam Rainsy Party) and Senator Ung Ang (representing the Sam Rainsy Party) Mr Rainsy and Senator Ung both were critical of the government's lack of response to corruption and believed that the apparent growth in prosperity in Phnom Penh was not reflected in rural Cambodia. Both men argued that unless the government was serious in tackling corruption, the disparity of wealth in Cambodia would become greater and greater. Social unrest, they argued, would result. Furthermore, both men were very concerned about continued human tights abuses in Cambodia. They were concerned that with the unofficial merger of the CPP and FIJNCINPEC that the Sam Rainsy Party was the only real opposition in Cambodia. Increasingly, they believed, Cambodia had become a one party state. Human rights abuse therefore, they argued, was very difficult to tackle and the government had less incentive to combat that evil. 80 Page 15 Saturday 29 January 2005 8.l5am Depart hotel for Phnom Penh International Airport 1O.20am Depart Phnom Penh for Bangkok Flight TG697 Arrive Bangkok 1125am 5.40pm Depart Bangkok for Sydney Sunday 30 January 2005 O.25am Arrive Sydney Page 16 si (ii) (c) Findings and Conclusions It was a great privilege to again return to Cambodia. The country has changed so much since I served with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia in 1992 and 1993. In some ways there have been significant improvements. Improved infrastructure, better schools, more doctors, new roads and houses, motor bikes and cars all speak of a growing prosperity. But nestled within a growing economy are the seeds of discontent. Human rights, particularly as they relate to resolving land tenure claims, continuing difficulties with the separation of powers (particularly an independent judiciary) and corruption are all significant issues that need to be faced by Cambodia and its emerging institutions. AusAiD is performing significant work in Cambodia. For relatively little outlay, the results of the projects we saw were impressive. It is heartening to see how so little money can mean so much to the lives of everyday Cambodians. AusAlD's work in health care, rebuilding the justice system and flood mitigation are great successes. Finally, I would like to thank Her Excellency Lisa Filipetto, the Australian Ambassador to Cambodia and her staff for a first rate program, and the opportunity to see AusAID projects and their beneficiaries and to meet significant individuals in the life of a developing Cambodian nation.

Iraq, from the time that the Ba'alh Party came to power in 1968 has been in desperate turmoil. When Saddam Hussein became the leader of the Ba'ath regime in 1979, the country fell victim to systematic, economic rape - yet that was possibly the least offensive of his many heinous acts. Largely responsible for the destruction of modem-day Iraq's economy, the dictator Saddam Hussein is also responsible for having committed unspeakable atrocities against hundreds of thousands of Iraq's minority groups including the Shi'ile Muslims. After more than two decades of tyranny, tear, poverty and genocide, Iraq's citizens were liberated on the 9 1h April, 2003. Iraq has decreed this date, the 95 of April, the day on which Iraq was invaded by the Coalition forces, a public holiday in commemoration of the event. This study tour afforded me a unique opportunity to observe, at first hand, Iraq's first historical democratic election since the fall of Saddam Hussein's tyrannical regime. Whilst my observations and experiences were, of necessity, confined to northern Iraq, my experience, as the only Australian Parliamentarian in the country at the time, was invaluable. Arrangements by local authorities, the Interim Government, electoral and international agencies, resulted in orderly queues of voters, separated according to gender, being able to freely lodge their vote for the first time in generations - most have never voted before. A surprising number of people were recorded as having voted and I was interested to observe, in many instances, the joy that was apparent on the faces of those participating. Around the five polling places that I visited, there was an overwhelming air of anticipation, hope and relief. The majority of Iraqis that I spoke with, through my interpreter, were optimistic about the future of Iraq as a result of being able to exercise their democratic rights, many of them for the first time in their lives, by voting in the general elections. A secondary benefit of the study tour was the number of approaches and enquines, from government and private sectors, in respect to mutually beneficial business and educational and cultural opportunities between Australia and Iraq. Email: senator Iigfool'aph gov au I wish to record my sincere thanks to Mr Simko Halmet, the KRG and PUK Representative in Australia, who travelled from Dubai through Istanbul, then to south eastern Turkey into IRAQ, for his invaluable assistance, advice, support and protection during my visit. Without his contribution, it is doubtful that this trip would have been possible. Mr Halmet is dedicated to improving conditions for Iraqi Kurds in Iraq and is determined to work towards the establishment of a government that will, not only protect Kurdish interests, but the interests of mainstream and Iraqi minority groups. i too share his enthusiasm. Due to the escalation in violence in the city of Baghdad in the run-up to the general election, and in particular the attack on the Australian Embassy where a suicide bomber drove into barncades on its perimeter just prior to my planned entry into Iraq, I was advised to avoid entering Iraq via the capital which I did on my previous visit. Travel between Baghdad and my ultimate destination in the northern regions would also have been extremely dangerous. Therefore it was decided that I would enter Iraq via its border with Turkey which necessitated flying into Diyabakir in eastern Turkey and then travelling overland to the Turkish-Iraqi border, then through the mountains to Arbil in Kurdish Iraq. During January, weather conditions in the mountains can mean that some roads are impassable due to snowfalls and can remain closed for several weeks. Due to the planned closing of the borders by the Interim Government, some days pnor to the election, it was necessary for me gain entry several days beforehand. Following is a daily account of my activities and the people with whom I met. I have included some observations purely from a traveller's point of view and also an indication of the day-to-day costs involved. 2 FRIDAY JANUARY 21 1030pm Departed Perth - Emirates EK0421 for Istanbul, via Dubai SATURDAY JANUARY22 5 30a Arrived Dubai. Met by Simko HALMET - KRG and PUK Representative in Australia, who accompanied ore for the entire duration of my tour. 250pm Departed Dubai - Emirates EKO121 5 40pm Arrived Istanbul, accommodation at Aziyade Hotel Istanbul, (2 52 - 3 stars) Piyerfoti Cad, hirecar for Turkish domestic Airport 7.15am Departed Atiaturk Airport - Turkish Air TK 0630 to Diyarbakir in south-eastern Turkey. 910am Arrived Diyarbakir, a predominantly Kurdish city, remnants of which are 10,000 years old. 9.30arn Departed south by car for Slopi, to Iraqi frontier. The vehicle was an alleged taxi (nightmare). The age of the vehicle overwhelmed me with nostalgia for my youth. 100pm Arrived at Turkish border post: Officials were rude - passport stolen (DEAl in Australia was informed and offered every assistance), used official one, (had to pay US $20 for a new visa for which no receipt was issued) Driver did not speak English; was Kurd, like 9910 of people in Slopi, Turkish side of the border. Paid driver US $140. Air reeked with petroleum fumes - needed to breathe through a handkerchief. Bought water (bottled) for all. (3) 330pm Eventually, after much haggling and telephone calls, we crossed the border. This was comparable to walking from Hell to Heaven, I imagine. Iraqi Kurds were excellent. 6 Peshmargas (Iraqi National Guardsmen) met Mr Simko HALMET and me - fine young men. Enroute we passed a vehicle convoy consisting of approximately 2,000 trucks, carrying mostly fuel, which stretched for around 100 kilometres. Travelled from border to Arbil in Kurdistan Had dinner enroute at city of Duhuk, at a typical Kurdish family restaurant, thickenAamb kebabs, paid US $30 for eight persons 0 and were waited on by 5 016 teenaged boys, which appears to be a more likely cultural norm in the Middle East. The weather was bitterly cold as we entered the mountains. Iraqi National Guards were apparent at checkpoints every 10-20 kms - although the presence of some were unobtrusive. 3 86 1015pm Arrived in Hawrarnan hotel, Arbil city If star) - where accommodation was US $149 per night. The accompanying Peshmargas were also billeted at this hotel where the windows were cuss-crossed with clear adhesive tape to protect against flying glass shards during explosions and mortar attacks. The entrance was bomb-proofed with a two metre high concrete formation. One metre wide round bollards also protected the structural parameters of the hotel. The conditions at this hotel however, were slightly better than the one where I had been accommodated on my previous visit to Arbil, last year. MONDAY JANUARY 24 700am Conditions and service in the hotel were very basic with requests such as hotter water and at greater volume, not met. Breakfasts were a combination of western and eastern cuisine and consisted of boiled eggs, warm buns, apricot lam, solid yogurt-like butter and cream cheese. 900am My party departed Arbil in two Nissan Patrol vehicles, 6 Iraqi National Guard (ING) soldiers all armed with AK47's and pistols - young men in excellent physical condition. I was offered, and accepted, the use of a .38 pistol. Drove through Koya, Dukan and several small towns to Sulaimani which is due east of Kirkuk. 1230pm Arrived at Sulaimani. Lunch in hotel restaurant with Simko HALMET, as guest of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). 1130pm Following a long, solitary walk to the outskirts of the CBD to purchase a telephone mm card, I was chastised for going unaccompanied. Although Sulaimani appears safe, it was suggested that I only venture outside the hotel with the protection of the Peshmargas. A new sim card was required in order for me to be able to use my mobile telephone for which I first needed to obtain a photo for ID purposes. Sim card and prepaid cost US $79 plus US $2 for ID photographs. It was also necessary to purchase 2 x US$30 prepaid cards at a later stage in order to maintain contact with home and office. TUESDAY JANUARY 25 1030am Welcomed at Foreign Relations Office of the PUK Headquarters, by its Head, Mr Mohammad TOFIQ. Also met Ali Il-ISAN, Director of Office of National Assembly, Baghdad.

Obtained pass for travel and election scrutiny. Mr AMIN is a former teacher and was happy to discuss election processes with me 800pm To Revan Restaurant ( 4 stars ) in Freedom Park, Sulaimani for dinner with Minister. Freedom Park was formerly occupied by the Saddam Hussein garrison, the largest in Iraq. Also at the dinner were Mohammad TOFIQ, Ali IHSAN, Sarko MIRZA, Simko HALMET and Bakir FATAH.

Discussed the proposed structure of the Federation of Iraq. The Prime Ministers daughter, Ara, is in Australia to study International Medicine at Curtin University. I was designated her Australian father, the sobriquet of which was flattering. 1130am Professor Robert AMIN from Curtin University telephoned - told him the Woodside donation had been presented to Prime Minister FATAH who in turn gave the donation to his Principal Secretary. Proposed a meeting with Kurdish Democratic Party. Hoped to travel to Halabja, in north-east Iraq the next day, near the Iranian border . 345pm Simko HALMET rang to say unable logo to Halab;a.

Mr TAIFOR was most pleasant and welcoming and issued an invitation for me to return. He was pleased to hear my firmly held belief that Kurds should have an autonomous homeland, (within the Federation it it works, without it it does not). Mr TAIFOR was very interested in accessing a supply of cheap energy to be used in the proposed conversion of Australian alumina powder to aluminium metal, often referred to as silver electricity' (Western Australia is the biggest exporter of alumina powder in the world.) PRL to inquire into interest from the Western Australian Chamber of Minerals and Energy of a visit to Iraq to discuss the subject in 5 88 more detail. Have subsequently arranged a meeting with Mr Tim SHANAHAN, President of the WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy . 300pm Street walk in the Sulaimani open markets with 3 Iraqi National Guard soldiers who walked three to tour paces behind me - all with AK47's and .38 pistols and although this provoked some attention, it was clearly not so unusual an event as to cause undue alarm or draw a crowd. 730pm Dined with H .E. Jalal TALABANI (in the mountains). I presented Salitage wines which were donated by the owner of Salitage, John HORGAN, for H.E. Jalal TALABANI and an Australian-made glass bird by Vereker, f or his wife, Mrs TALABANI. Talks centred on the formation and structure of a new Federal Government; talk of a Consul-General for Sulaimani from Australia.

Only vehicles, fire and water trucks, ambulances, police cars and police motor cycles (Hondas) and 2-3 peshmarga station wagons (Nissans) are on the streets. Other passenger cars and vehicles were banned for two days prior to the elections. The city was eerily quiet and (as usual) peaceful. SUNDAY JANUARY 30 900am Breakfast with Simko HALMET, Sarko MIRZA and Nicholas ROTHWELL, journalist, from The Australian newspaper. 1100am Tour of polling booths (five). Interim President and Kurdistan Prime Minister were also at one of the booths. Massive turn-out in Sulaimani. I was accompanied by two Germans.

Weather may be a problem - which was closing in on mountain passes which are the only exits out of Sulaimani to the north. For reasons that are manifest, I had no desire to travel towards the south. 1000am Departed Sulaimani for border town of Slopi in Northern Iraq. Offered tips to staff at the Palace Hotel which were pleasantly refused. 7 90 230pm Stopped for lunch at Kurdish restaurant in Duhuk in northern Iraq, the town also served as a Headquarters of the KDP. 500pm Arrived Slopi (Iraq side of Turkish border) where the border still officially closed. 510pm Cleared Iraq Customs, but was told I would have to walk the 1.5km to Turkey as Turks would not allow vehicles through. Turkish officials relented when telephoned by the Iraqi manager of the border post. 740pm Cleared Turkey Customs after much trouble. Payment of US $ facilitated my egress. Hundreds of trucks laden with (mostly) petrol, inch their way through Turkish Customs. I found the border police on the Turkey side to be rude, arrogant and, prone to unnecessarily prolonging the clearance process of fuel, material and foodstuffs laden trucks. This delay in allowing fuel through exacerbates inflation, causes queues (sometimes) 2 krns long ?t Kurdish, and, other Iraq service stations, and adds greatly, as a consequence, to rebuilding a battered neglected nation. Wages for labourers and the unskilled are US $8 -10 per day. 1100pm Arnved Miroglu Hotel in central Diyarbakir (3 \u00bd stars) where I stayed overnight. Tariff was US $45 per night - an interesting comparison to the cost of accommodation in Iraq: Taxi fare from the border to Diyarbakir was US$120.00 in cash. Only US dollars are acceptable in these frontier situations TUESDAY FEBRUARY 1 845am Departed Hotel Miroglu by alleged taxi (no seat belts, no handles on the inside of the doors) 900am Arrived at the airport Driver wanted to charge me US $15 -when I said I would speak to the police he dropped the tare to US $10 - (about 10 million Turkish Lira). 955am Departed Diyarbakir on Airbus 340. 300/500 1145am Landed Istanbul Attaturk Airport - snow covering most of Istanbul. 715pm Departed Istanbul on Emirates Air for Perth via Dubai. WEDNESDAY JANUARY 2 5 l5pm Arrived Perth International Airport. 8 EPILOGUE Since my return from Iraq on the 2 111 February 2005, I have followed the results of the election, eager to see the formation of a new federation, giving voice to the numerous ethnic and religious groups in Iraq and, it is hoped, quell the deep sectarian differences. My firsthand experience of Iraq's first democratic elections following the deposing of Saddam Hussein at polling booths on that historic Sunday, 30 1, January 2005, was a resounding endorsement that Iraqis were keen to embrace the principles of democracy and freedom. In spite of fears that they would be the target of insurgents unhappy with the US-led occupation, which had led to the security lock-down the previous night, 60 per cent of the population turned out to vote at polling booths across the nation. Their responsibility, to elect, from the 7,471 candidates, a 275 member national assembly, that would select a president for the new Iraqi Republic. With more than a month since the elections, it has become clear that Iraq's minority Kurds and the majority Shrites may finally be heard. Final figures have confirmed that victory belongs to the United Iraqi Alliance (UtA), a coalition dominated by the formerly suppressed Shiite Islamic parties and backed by the influential religious leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, holding 140 of the 275 seats. The Kurds, headed by Secretary General Jalal Talabani, have succeeded in winning a one quarter majority, and are expected to form an alliance with the Shia. It still remains to be seen who the Assemble will elect as president, which will then select a Prime Minister and Cabinet with a draft constitution expected to be completed by the 15 August 2005. The instrument will then go to a referendum no later than the 15 October of this year. Despite the Sunni boycott of the election, there remains much optimism that future leadership will attempt to reach across traditional efhno-religious lines in order to unit Iraq and its many disparate groups. On reflection, it would seem after my second trip to Iraq, which by no means makes me an expert on this vexed issue, but non-the-less, I have firmed my position that the press and the media generally need to alter their apparently immutable view of this emerging nation. Much good has come out of the coalition's disposal of Saddam Hussein. The people that I have seen, spoken to and dined with are happy - they have a future, one which they are entitled to. They are overjoyed at the privilege of voting, at the prospect of joining the civilised world, at the thought of starting a business, at educating their children. But their joy is more manifest when I say, in answer to their question as to what country I am from, and I say Australia. Their thanks are effusive. This is what matters in the long run. The arguments can rage on WMD's or the legality of the coalition intervention, or more troops or less troops, they are just thankful we have given them a life, hope and a future. That was abundantly clear to me. 9 92 SENATOR STEPHEN CONROY OVERSEAS STUDY REPORT (2005) The Microsoft Government Leaders Forum was held in Prague from 3 l January to 2\" February, 2005. The Conference is a regular event held around the world and brings together leaders of government, non-government organisations and international financial institutions. Due to EU privacy laws the attendance list for the Forum is unavailable, however attendees included Prime Ministers, Presidents, Ministers, bureaucrats and the private sector. The Speakers list was very impressive and included:- \u00e2\u00a2 Carl Bildst UN Secretary General's Special Envoy for the Balkans, former Prime Minister of Sweden. \u00e2\u00a2 Bill Gates Chairman and Chief Software Architect - Microsoft Corporation \u00e2\u00a2 Stanislov Gross Prime Minister, Czech Republic \u00e2\u00a2 Vaclav Klaus, President, Czech Republic \u00e2\u00a2 Vladimire Mlvnar, Minister of Informatics, Czech Republic \u00e2\u00a2 Chris Patten Chancellor - Oxford University. Former Commissioner of External Affairs - European Union and former Governor of Hong Kong \u00e2\u00a2 Vivian Reding Commissioner for Information Society and Media - European Commission \u00e2\u00a2 Lucio Stanca, Minister for Innovation and Technologies - Italy \u00e2\u00a2 Eric Worth, Secretary to the Minister for Reform - France The Forum's three objectives are:- (i) to focus on the emerging challenges in employment, social inclusion, governance, competitiveness and social inclusion, that every Government must address; (ii) engage in discussion, share experiences and develop new relationships; (iii) act in partnership to address the identified challenges. The Conference was structured with an opening plenary session followed by three choices for pursuing particular areas of interest. The three choices were:- \u00e2\u00a2 Employment and social inclusion \u00e2\u00a2 Governance \u00e2\u00a2 Competitiveness and Economic development. The final plenary session, titled \"The Opportunities Ahead\" was designed to allow the track facilitators to present the results from the individual tracks to all delegates and to discuss the outcomes from a macro perspective. 94 Opening Plenary Session The Conference opened with a discussion about the \"Lisbon Agenda\", a program created in 2000 designed to enhance the economic growth of the EU. The discussion focussed on the need to improve economic growth and the drivers of productivity. The question of public private partnerships and their role was debated. Another focus of discussion was the need for the local software industry to be promoted via the \"eco-system\" of thousands of software developers. Vivian Reding, Commissioner for information Society and Media- European Commission. Commissioner Reding announced the launch of the EU Grant Advisor Program. This program will see EU funds used to establish website filters to advise small business on the criteria for various programs. The EU's program also includes four new major development centres for research and innovation and one hundred and seventy learning centres. Commissioner Reding acknowledged that, despite much colour and movement, the EU was under achieving on its targets in relation to the Lisbon Agenda. The Commissioner believed that it was necessary to relaunch the whole strategy by making some tough choices and highlighting some key objectives. For the strategy to succeed each member state must embrace and champion the Agenda. The failure of the EU to embrace Information Communications Technology (ICT) was a major cause of its failure to reach its targets. Commissioner Reding stated that ICT investment would be a major driver of productivity growth. As an example, the Commissioner believed that 90% of future investment in cars would be in ICT. The goal of the Agenda was to use ICT to raise the quality of life and by 2010 create a borderless European information space - one open market for the entire EU. This could only be achieved with the comprehensive roll-out of broadband at high speed and a combination of 3G, wireless and satellite. The EU Commission was seeking to create a single internal market for all of Europe on-line. This would lead to a simplified regulatory framework and would lead to increased investment certainty. The disparity between ICT research and development expenditure in the US, Japan and EU is stark. The EU only spends a third as much as the US on research and development in ICT and only two-thirds the amount spent by Japan. The EU believes that this is why the US has experienced relatively stronger economic growth. The EU invests later, and at a lower level, in ICT. The Commissioner believes that without the doubling of budget expenditure on education/universities and research, the EU will fail to meet its targets. Rt. Hon Chris Patten Chancellor of the Universities of Oxford and Newcastle, and former EU Commissioner for External Affairs The presentation by Lord Patten, began with a historic overview of the economic performance of the EU. He described 1945-1975 as the good years before the oil shocks. The instability caused by the oil shocks was followed by a period of prosperity that continued until the fall of the Berlin Wall and the re-unification of Germany. The Lisbon Agenda was designed to increase competition and accelerate 2 economic growth to enable the EU to pay for its social model. He argued that improved quality of life would come through increases in leisure time and not increases income. Lord Patten identified four problems that the EU must face to achieve its objectives. The first problem was changing demographics. The population is ageing as birth rates fall and life expectancy increases. The economic and social effects of the ageing population could be mitigated in the short term by increasing migration. Lord Patten argued however that migration is not a long term solution. The second problem was caused by the recent addition often new countries into the EU. This represented a 20% increase in size but only a 5% increase in the EU GDP. This was causing \"indigestion\". The third issue was the adoption of technology in the EU. The US had a more flexible labour market but this led to greater inequalities. The EU has a less flexible labour market which adversely affects low skilled workers and increases the unemployment rate. The fourth challenge that Lord Patten identified was that of globalisation. He stated that the emergence of India and China could not be underestimated. In one generation, these economies were moving from producing plastic flowers to producing financial services. Lord Patten outlined his views on the changes that were required. These included making the labour market more flexible, and increasing expenditure on research and development. Nordic countries have done well but the rest of the EU had patchy results and had missed growth and employment targets. He also identified a growing pension crisis and pointed out that 4.4% of the EU Budget was spent on 7% of the EU's population. This figure is quite extraordinary and it is a little hard to take the EU Commission seriously when they complain about the lack of spending on Universities and Research and Development. John-Claude Burirelman Director General - Joint Research Centre, European Commission, Brussels. The Director General outlined his belief that there was still a long way to go before IT developments had their full impact. These developments would produce challenges and opportunities for the European economic model. He argued that there would be a major re-engineering of the EU model not just an increase of productivity caused by IT. The growth that existed post 1945 which paid for free university education and health was lagging. The world economy was changing to a knowledge based society and the EU had been slow to respond. The Director Genera] explained there were three stages of an economic cycle. He described the first period lasting 20-30 years as the installation period. During this period the old economy declines and through a process of \"creative destruction\" a 3 new paradigm emerges. This would be followed by a huge financial bubble. The second period or \"Turning Point\" was a recession/depression with instability and uncertainty. The Director General believed that was where we were in the cycle. The final period, called the \"Deployment Period, would also last 20-30 years. He described this as the flourishing of full potential of the triumphant paradigm- a golden age of growth. The Director General stated that IT was a critical sector. It comprised 10 per cent of OECD GOP and 6 per cent of business employment. IT was a systemic technology, enabling productivity enhancement in other economic sectors. IT was the new big technological paradigm shift generating deep technological process in conjunction with fundamental socio-economic challenges and opportunities. The Director General warned that EU companies lagged behind their international rivals. He produced statistics which showed that the top 500 EU companies invested just over half the amount that the top 500 non EU companies invested in IT hardware. The Director General identified key issues which he believed needed facing up to: I. Jobs provide an income but also are identity building and ensure that a person is included in society. What are the areas for future growth and therefore jobs? 2. All future jobs will directly, or indirectly, relate to mastering of e- skills. There is a need to identify these skills and the optimal market settings to deliver them. 3. Skills distribution is unequal between regions, gender and age. How do we bridge these divides? 4. The existing institutions of social inclusion are changing due to ICTs. What policies are needed to manage this change? Lena Tsinouri, Professor - University of Athens, Greece. Ms Tsipouri believed that Europe was behind the US in competitiveness and economic growth. This was due to the EU's institutions, the formal and informal rules and their enforcement characteristics. The Lisbon Agenda and structural funds set aside by the EU were the main tools for addressing the European market failures. Ms Tsipouri argued that entrepreneurship was crucial to overcoming the US lead. Ms Tsipouri claimed that developed countries were competitive only in high value added products. The solution as margins tightened was to create new forms of doing business eg. PPPs and university/industry co-operation. Ms Tsipouri believed that we needed strong university leadership to initiate/respond to effective partnerships. However, she cautioned there was a high risk of substituting market failures with government or other failures. 4 Governance Stream Following the opening plenary session I decided to attend the governance stream to listen to the debate about these issues. I have included a synopsis of the issues dealt with in this stream. OVERVIEW \"Social, economic and political lift exists through interactions among individuals. These interactions require Governance: ie., coordination including authoritative conflict resolution. As we use more ICT, we shift patterns of interaction in ways that require shifts in governance. As the Information Age matures, how should we handle conflicts spanning jurisdictional boundaries? How should we help governments become more effective learning organisations? How should we balance the rights and responsibilities of the individual against those of the state? What are the right laws, rules, policies and organisational structures that will allow us to capture the benefits of e-Government while maintaining the confidence of citizens and businesses?\" The first session was titled \"The New Architecture of Government with Roles and responsibilities, Emphasis on Rules and Governance\". DESCRIPTION: \"Technology has opened up new opportunities, but it has also changed the nature of governance process. Who are the critical stakeholders today in that process? What are the right governance models or structures as information moves between cities, regions, countries and the EU?\" Colm Butler Director, Information Society Policy Department of the Taoiseach (Prime Minister), Ireland. Mr Butler outlined some of the issues evolving in c-government. Are Government websites adequate? Many citizens are suffering c-government fatigue. There is an emerging trough of disillusionment at what governments are delivering. He described the experience as equivalent to how bank customers feel about being pushed out of banks and onto phones or the internet. A government's purpose is to serve its citizens, not tell them how to access it. There will be a perennial battle between privacy and efficiency. 5 AEnes Bradier, Deputy Head of Unit - eGovernnient, European Commission. Ms Bradier believed that technology was creating new ways for governments to communicate. The EU must respond by building new learning organisations that must be flexible and proactive. The new systems must have inter-operability. There would be some negative outcomes. There would be greater security problems and this would lead to greater intrusion into people's lives. Government needed to anticipate these issues to avoid problems. Governments must accept that everyone was important and citizens must accept some responsibilities. The greater the degree of inclusiveness, the greater the cost. Is the purpose to open access or to empower? The single largest challenge was whether to stick with \"silos\" or move to \"networks\". This is a challenge that we, in Australia, are struggling with. The ATO have just offered faster tax returns if people will sign away their privacy concerns and allow the ATO to access their government files. Maria Nevkova, Governor - District of Stara Zagova, Bulgaria. \"Online Services Improve Public Administration at regional and Local Levels\" The Governor outlined her administration's successes in converting from a paper based economy to a knowledge based economy. The strategic goals of the program were: \u00e2\u00a2 The creation of a suitable environment; \u00e2\u00a2 The provision of effective and easy-to-use services, and \u00e2\u00a2 Improved inter-operability The Governor described the single point of access to eServices that they created. It was a transactional gateway for District Administration, Municipality and the Police Department. The main design drivers were accessibility and versatility of services. The services that are now available online include: \u00e2\u00a2 Authorised copy of government property certificates; \u00e2\u00a2 Duplicate copies of birth certificates; \u00e2\u00a2 Online applications and feedback to police. The following services will soon be available: \u00e2\u00a2 Services from Hygiene/Epidemic Regional Offices, and \u00e2\u00a2 Integration with two additional municipalities in the region of Kazaulak and Radnevo The Governor believed that the benefits to citizens were transparent, quality services, 24 x 7 access to eGovemment services from anywhere. This, she argued, would save time and money and give civil control over authorities. 6 99 RN Dr. Zuzana Kilanova Director of Justice Information - Ministry of Justice, Slovak Republic. \"E-Justice in Slovakia\" Ms Kajanova outlined the Justice Network in Slovakia. The Ministry of Justice included forty-five district courts, eight regional courts and the Supreme Court. The three key applications were a business register, court management and JASPI - the legal information system. The court management project allowed the optimisation of working procedures. it facilitated random assignment of cases to the judges - this had been required by law since 2002. The Business Register allowed a centralised business registration process. Since 2000 - business registration has been possible on the internet and free of charge. There is also Internet access to the Statistical Office, the Tax Office and the Customs Office. The JASPI legal information system allowed access to the following: \u00e2\u00a2 Law - published since 1945 \u00e2\u00a2 Reconstructed texts of rules and government resolutions \u00e2\u00a2 Supreme Court decisions published since 1961 \u00e2\u00a2 Constitutional Court decisions published since 1993. Clan Luca Petrillo Minister's Advisor for Internet - Ministry of Communications, Italy. Mr Petrilli believed that the spread of broadband was the most critical issue facing Italy. He outlined all the potential options including 3G, digital terrestrial with interactivity, fibre, DSL, wireless and satellite. He was opposed to mandating any particular technology and believed that incentives were the appropriate policy response. The second session in the governance stream was titled \"The Role of Education in Preparing People to be Effective Citizens in today's Information Society\". DESCRIPTION: \"How do we ensure that e-Government initiatives deliver the results that Governments need? (Sub-question: What degree of digital literacy is required, within administrations and across the population at large, to prepare the ground for widespread take-up of e-citizenship opportunities?) How can we insure that the majority ofpeople gain essential benefits from e-Government initiatives? (Sub-question: To make this happen, are there any priority areas of numeracy, literacy, IT literacy and e-cizizeirship that should be addressed through formal education?) What measures of success are appropriate here? (Examples: the proportion ofparticular groups of citizens and businesses engaging successfully as a result of digital literacy initiatives; the costs and benefits of that participation)\" 7 100 Professor Claudio Dondi Vice President EDEN and President of SCIENTER Professor Dondi argued that simplicity was the key. The education process should not only be about building citizenship but also about building competitiveness and effectiveness. He was concerned that despite an increase in ICT access for students there had been no increase in the learning outcomes. Professor Dondi was concerned that the teachers were not able to maximise the technology's impact on educational outcomes. The professor also believed that the never ending ideological battle over education would reduce outcomes. Professor Bob Fryer National Director for Widening Participation in Learning, UK Professor Fryer outlined four key questions that he believed need to be addressed. The first was \"learning for what sort of world\" the second was \"what kind of learning?\" The third \"how can 'e' help and what are the main challenges?\" Finally, \"what should be the role of governments and public policy in encouraging/stimulating learning?\" Professor Fryer detailed the increased world of uncertainty and unreliability that citizens faced. He was very conscious of the tension between what people wanted from governments and what governments wanted to provide. Professor Fryer presented some statistics which demonstrated the challenges society faced. He illustrated with the following example. This was a measurement of online skills and experience with the following categories: (i) Can locate information on the WWW (ii) Searched for political information online (iii) Looked up information on government services on line (iv) Searched/applied for jobs online (v) Taken a class/learning online (vi) Used computer to do homework (vii) Used computer to find books in library without help Only 20% of those surveyed had done the first category and only 6% had graduated to the seventh category. This brought into sharp focus the role of education, but there are many roles for education. He quoted from Raymond Williams' three vital functions of learning in periods of rapid and widespread social change:- I. For making sense of change - information, ideas, knowledge, concepts, understandings, insights, theories, a critical and challenging mind; 2. For adapting to change - maximising benefits and minimising costs, making the most of change, capturing and applying knowledge; 3. For shaping change - as authors of change rather than its victims, navigating risk and uncertainty, at the heart of citizenship for the 20th Century and the democratic project 8 101 Gareth Bunn Vice President, Government Practice, UK Mr Bunn's presentation was my equal favourite. He was one of the few presenters who had any degree of scepticism about the 'brave new world'. Mr Bunn questioned the Lisbon Agenda, suggesting that as it was a top down approach that rather than being welcomed it may actually become an imposition on society. The information society provided lots of additional information, it did not replace information. The problem was that there was no help to discern the quality or intent behind the new information. The internet provided an excellent case study of these dangers. Mr Bunn believed that humans were social animals and that governments and corporations needed to remember this. Humans, he argued, performed best person to person not person to screen. Mr Bunn argued that society comes first, information second. The question of what was as effective citizen was also discussed. Was it an Economic unit, was it a compliant citizen? Who chose the channels for government services? Mr Bunn made the point that not everyone wants to use the internet for their tax or to use interactive digital television. This raised the question; do citizens want the channels the government is providing? This could lead to a disconnection on policy. Mr Bunn believed that citizens wanted service delivery that relates to a citizen's own life events. Government service delivery should be relevant, practical and affordable. Andrea Pirotti: Executive Director, European Director, European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) Ms Pirotti outlined the purpose of ENISA. The reason most people don't shop online was security. The internet is continually under attack from viruses and worms. ENISA was created to provide security for industry and consumers. interconnected networks have increased the need to co-operate across sectors and national borders. The Agency will be a forum where all stakeholders can meet in order to be able to increase information exchange. ENISA has a number of tasks including gathering all relevant information and raise awareness without frightening people. ENISA is now working with the EU Member States, industry and the global community. ENISA is in its infancy and is working to meet all its objectives at this stage. )Professor William Dutton: Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. Professor Dutton gave the most interesting presentation. His independent institute has collected an enormous amount of data on internet usage. The Professor began by reminding delegates of some of the great promises of the computer age \"the paperless office\", \"computers would lead to a leisure society\". However, the reality was that the internet was both a teacher and a terrorist. Professor Dutton argued that Europe was debating the social impact of the ID' the US had just got on with it. The Institute's surveys had found that there was a digital divide. In the US 71 per cent had ac\u2014s to the net but in the UK it was only 59 per cent. However, the most startling fact was that the internet reinforced the existing social and economic divide. In the ULpeople in the highest economic quartile were more than three times as 9 102 likely to use the Internet as people in the lowest quartile. Internet usage also differed significantly amongst age groups. While 80 per of 16-24 year old used the Net in the UK., only 39 per cent of 55-64 year olds were online. This is a cautionary lesson for government service delivery mechanisms. Cybertrust is a significant issue that must be faced. The following tables and graphs from Professor Dutton's presentation illustrate some of these 11flnu\" S S Pecent Who Use the iernei Lowest and Highest Economic Quartiles 4? 11 1''4 )i Britain, 2003 User already on broadband 11% User probably going on broadband 24% User not thinking of broadband 24% L k 1E frc 1. rL1 Britons and the Internet Excluded 7% 12 Non-user 41% 13 106 nte[ net use by Age, Circa, 200 1 1 USA Korm Britain Japan Oam&ny Sp ain Italy Hmgoy Internet Use in F3iili,i by 1.Ue Sttg(: Q.

Klaus was very blunt on the impact of IT. I have included a full copy of his speech but the title and one quote give a sense of his perspective: \"Increasingly Sophisticated Technology and the Dangerous Dreams and Utopias of our Times\" To be more spec ific, the term 'knowledge economy\" is for me an empty, undefined and undefinable, more or less propagandist, or lobbyist term, which cannot become an object for a serious discussion This was a very confronting speech to hundreds of senior executives in the IT sector. Governance Stream Continued. Yladamir Mlvnar: Minister of Informatics, Czech Republic Minister Mlynar outlined the experiences of the Czech Government with c-government. He argued that every sixty years there was a successful technological revolution. In 1771 there was the Industrial Revolution, in 1829\u2014 coal and steam railway was invented, in 1875 steel and electricity came of age, in 1908 it was the age of oil, cars and mass production and in 1975 the age of information technology was born. 18 II Minister Mlyner posed the question, \"what is the role of government at these junctures?\" to regulate or not? He argued that the government should regulate to support competition and little else. A government should not decide what the best form of broadband is, or that open source should be adopted. He believed that this was the same as mandating the technology to collect a toll. A government should examine what technology can do, not what company to buy it from. Governments require the most efficient tools and the market place would generate them. He detailed the Czech Government's portal. A citizen could pay their taxes and receive information about services. The largest problem was the processes of state administration. He believed that the European cultural/legal model left the EU behind the US and the Asian Tiger Model. In the EU everything was proscribed by law and this required change to laws to have c-government. Will Hutton: Chief Executive, The Work Foundation, London and Member of the Kok Group. Mr Hutton provided a mid-term c-view of the Lisbon Agenda. He believed that China would become the mass production hub of the world. That GDP of India/China would be larger than the USA's by 2020. Asia would become the locomotive of the world economy. Mr Hutton believed that mass production of manufactures would be based in China and mass production of financial services would be based in India. He believed that the increase in US productivity was due to the ICT revolution and scale. The EU's trade in manufactures and services was contracting. There was no significant ICT sector to kick start productivity in the EU The EU's first fifteen members had a declining population by 2050. The university sector in the EU was second rate. The EU needed life long learning, it needed labour market reforms to encourage people off benefits and it needed greater competition. One area of comparative advantage was the environmental preferences of the EU. The Volkswagen developed in the EU was clean and would have export potential. Mr Hutton favoured National Action Plans (NAPs) with a name and shaming, naming and \"faming\" approach. Carl Bildt: Former Prime Minister, Sweden and UN Secretary General's Special Envoy for the Balkans. Mr Bildt stated that the EU economy deserved the bad press it received. However, he believed that the EU economy was about to enjoy a renaissance if it \"stayed the course\". He gave a colourful description of European history with the ultimate victory for freedom in 1989. The recent expansion of the EU by ten countries had seen 100 million people enter the EU. By 2015, another one hundred million would be integrated via the Ukraine, Croatia, Turkey and the Balkan States. He believed this would create huge competitive tension within the third phase of globalisation. The EU would have a deeper and wider single market. However the EU's regulations were too cumbersome and the labour market was too rigid. He argued that the relocation of production to new member states would kick start the revolution. These decisions would be based, not just on labour costs, but regulation 19 I: and taxation. He described the flat tax band wagon. Estonia had introduced a 26% flat tax reducing to 24% and eventually to 20%. Slovakia had introduced a 19% flat tax, Romania was looking at a 16% rate, Poland and Czechoslovakia a 15% rate. An eminent persons group in Germany was advocating a 30% flat rate. Mr Bildt argued that it was not the size of the IT sector that mattered but how other sectors adopted IT that would lead to productivity growth. The final governance session was titled \"Secure Government Interaction with Citizens - the Government to Citizen Perspective\" DESCRIPTION: \"As government interaction with citizens increases, so do issues related to privacy, security and oversight of information. How can or should governance models change to address these new challenges? Andre van der Meer: Project Manager, c-Parliament, Netherlands Mr van der Meer argued that as technology increased that the level of intrusion into citizen's lives increased. It was a battle between co-ordination and control. He believed that if a government simply presented information this was not sufficient to close the gap between politicians and citizens. Mfrosl*v Kovacic: State Secretary, Central Government Office for c-Croatia Mr Kovacic claimed that to achieve c-Government successfully the project must have the strong political backing of the Government including the Prime Minister. It must be well advertised. The Croation Government had to change two pieces of legislation just to create an c-form. The problems encountered were significant, people and public servants oppose change. Legislative change is slow and the uptake of electronic signatures has so far been low. Jan Deprest: President, federal Public service ICT (FEDICT), Belgium Mr Deprest outlined the Belgium Government's experience at introducing and c-ID card. The title of his presentation was \"Bringing Services closer to the citizen using e-ll) \". He argued that the key to the success of the c-world was strong authentication. Belgium had encountered an c-commerce problem. Anyone could pretend to be anyone. Privacy concerns were paramount. The strongest form of identification world-wide was a smart-card based identification. Belgium has a long history of identity cards, only the introduction of the chip was a real challenge. The c-ID had three main functions: \u00e2\u00a2 data capture \u00e2\u00a2 authentication \u00e2\u00a2 digital signature Many citizens were concerned that it may become a monitoring system using GPS. 20 13 4 Final Plenary Session: \"The opportunities ahead\" The three moderators provided a brief summary of the discussions within the three tracks. Key recommendations included \u00e2\u00a2 more flexible labour markets \u00e2\u00a2 new governance model \u00e2\u00a2 Government's need to shake off the command and control mentality \u00e2\u00a2 trust was a critical issue \u00e2\u00a2 privacy and identity protection were paramount considerations \u00e2\u00a2 increase in capital investment is necessary to avoid a deterioration of labour quality \u00e2\u00a2 must combine flexibility with security in labour markets \u00e2\u00a2 must improve public procurements e.g. PPPs \u00e2\u00a2 improve the framework of & D Bill Gates: Chairman and Chief Software Architect, Microsoft Corporation Mr Gates described the rapid pace of innovation and its impact on technology. He illustrated this by way of the Microsoft Tablet. The Tablet had fallen below $500 in price, so students could now access it. It allowed you to take notes; all texts were on line and would soon have voice recognition. Mr Gates argued that software break-throughs, if properly applied, should generate savings. These savings represent dollars that are now available for further growth. He indicated that Microsoft were looking at a different structure for data storage, a website or template on which you could pull together all of the information relating to the one topic. He also argued that the single greatest challenge facing the industry and Microsoft was security. He believed that the weakest link was the authorisation process. How can you be sure that the person at the other end of the computer is who they say they are? A simple password would be insufficient. Many companies were working on smartcards and bio-metric IDs. Microsoft is working closely with European experts on software research in a program called Euroscience. Microsoft's other public sector focus was partnering to ensure \u00e2\u00a2 quality of service \u00e2\u00a2 higher productivity and efficiency \u00e2\u00a2 reductions in cost \u00e2\u00a2 increased flexibility, and \u00e2\u00a2 interoperability - designed to break down silos Mr Gates discussed the debate between Open Standards and Open Source. He passionately argued that Microsoft supported the former and that these were needed to 21 1 14 encourage the developments in ICT. The other factors needed to facilitate development in the sector were \u00e2\u00a2 a regulatory framework to encourage Telco's to upgrade the network \u00e2\u00a2 copyright and Patent laws that delivered certainty \u00e2\u00a2 Universities of an international standard He did not believe that the level of taxation was an issue. Mr Gates believed that despite the belief by many that the US had an edge in costs, this was not the case. The US had a more expensive culture in areas like health, legal and defence issues where the EU had a more expensive culture in social costs and the safety-net. Mr Gates was concerned about the level of the US budget and current account deficits; he described this as \"uncharted territor y\". He believed that floating currencies were the friends of adjustment, it allowed gradual changes. He also argued that the US had unsustainable levels of consumption and no savings. This was the last session of the Conference. I would like to thank Microsoft for the opportunity to attend and, in particular, Mr Steve Vamos and Mr Simon Edwards for their support and encouragement. As I have only recently taken over the IT Portfolio the Conference allowed me a speed learning opportunity that enabled me to come to grips with some of the more complex issues challenging legislators around the world. 22 S This Page Is Intentionally Left Blank 116 MR BOB SERCOMBE MP You Bob Ser ombe, 'P Shadow Minister for Pacific Islands Federal Member for Maribyrnong inc- ely Bob Sercombe, M.P.

The Visit of President Hu Jintou to Australia in October 2003 and planned visit of Prime Minister Howard to China in April 2005 are important steps in consolidating the political relationship. The bilateral trade and economic relationship is developing well. Driven by China's growing demand for Australian exports particularly energy, commodities and agricultural products. Although the trade is broadening with increasing Chinese demands for Australian services including education, tourism and financial services Australia is well regarded within China as a reliable supplier of high quality products right across the range of trade There is high level official support within China for beginning formal FTA talks with Australia following the completion of the joint-scoping study between our two countries.

Particularly, the need to open new export markets to ensure that Australian regional communities continue to have strong international demand for their products.

The Delegation noted the significant structural reform that has occurred in Australia's TCF industry and the need to ensure it remains a competitive supplier of products The opportunity for closer cooperation and investment in this sector was discussed (iv) Conclusion information obtained from the visit provided valuable input into the development of Labor 's approach to a possible ETA with China Following the visit, Labor has considered the implications of an ETA with China and has outlined publicly its policy position. Labor has adopted a positive disposition to an ETA with China reflecting the opportunities this will provide for Australian business and the potential for closer integration with the world's largest fastest growing economy.

Depart Shanghai for Sydney. Findings The focal point of discussions was the prospect of a Free Trade Agreement between Australia and China. The bilateral trade and economic relationship continues to be underpinned by China's growing appetite for Australian energy resources. Australia is also well regarded within China as a reliable supplier of quality products. There is interest in China to access Australian expertise in education, middle management (methodology and human resources), financial and other professional services. Occupational Health and Safety expertise is one example of a professional service in demand. There is high level official support within China for beginning formal FTA talks with Australia. This sentiment was expressed consistently during meeting with officials. 5 141 If .1 ViL- Federal Labor Trade Delegation meeting with Mr Zhang Zhijun Vice Minister (second from right) Liou Dong, Deputy Director General (right) of the International Department on the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and officials: (starting from left) Senator Kate Lundy Shadow Minister for Manufacturing and Consumer Affairs Australian Embassy representative, Simon Crean Shadow Minister for Trade, Gavan O'Connor Shadow Minister for Agriculture and Warren Snowdon MP. It is anticipated that, given the feasibility (scoping) study on a F1'A between our two countries has been completed, the Australian and Chinese Governments will release the study publicly only when the Prime Minister visits China in April. It is also anticipated that at this point a joint announcement will be made to begin formal negotiations. Since the visit it has become clear from statements by the Prime Minister that the Australian Government has conceded the granting of market Economy Status ass condition for beginning formal FTA negotiations. This is despite earlier denials by both Embassy officials in Beijing during our visit and earlier comments by the Prime Minister China is Sensitive about the potential impact of an FTA on their agriculture sector, noting that 900 million people live in rural and regional areas. Officials made it clear that this sector is critical for China's social (and therefore political) stability. The delegation took those comments on board but noted the relatively small size of Australia's agriculture exports' when compared to Chinese production and demand and also the sensitivity of agriculture in Australia. Particularly, the need to open new 'This graph draws on the figures in CHINA Facts and Figures 2004.

The Delegation noted the significant structural reform that has occurred in Australia's TCF industry and the need to ensure it remains a competitive supplier of products. The opportunity for closer cooperation and investment in this sector was discussed. It is an area that, according to Chinese officials, will be highlighted as a vulnerability for Australia in the feasibility (scoping) study. Australia's sensitivities relate primarily to the threat to manufacturing. Both the Union Movement, particular the Australian Metal Workers Union (AMWU) and Australian Industry Group have been active in highlighting the threat and demanding a transparent process for the negotiations. The Free Trade Agreement does present an opportunity to lessen or remove China's tariffs on value-added manufacturing from Australian companies to improve market access. However any benefit from increased exports to China from Australia will need to be accompanied by policies that both support strategic sectors in Australia and improve the ability of Austrade and Australian Business Groups In China to identify and facilitate specific opportunities fro Australian products. Beyond manufactures, China's access to Australia's unique research, development and practical application of expertise in agriculture, such as dairy and animal husbandry can assist China in the modernisation of the vast majority of China's domestic economy: fanning. During our visit, many Australian companies operating in China expressed their concern about MES being conceded as a pre-condition to formal negotiations, a position strongly advocated by Federal Labor. 7 143 Market Economy Status has implications for Australia as it evokes the WTO remedies against dumping. This represents a change from the current anti-dumping remedies under Australian law. Any increase in China's ability to 'dump' excess product at unreasonably cheap prices in the Australian market is seen as a threat to fair competition in both domestic and international markets. Labor's view is that MES status is a legitimate issue to bargain with during formal negotiations and to concede it sooner undermines the negotiating strength of Australia and therefore has the potential to weaken the possible outcomes in the deal. Recognition of MES by Australia represents to China an important political acknowledgement of their success in creating open market. The political symmetry of Australia as a developed economy supporting MES having previously strongly advocated China's accession to the WTO, should not be underestimated. In any analysis of the potential positive outcomes for Australia in a Free Trade Agreement with China, the importance of MES to China is an obvious and important bargaining chip. Correspondingly, Australia has a substantial 'ask'. An important goal prior to the beginning of formal negotiations ought to be to ascertain what tangible barriers exist for Australians wishing to access the Chinese domestic market. Another factor is how access to Chinese production capacity can be used to facilitate the global reach of Australian manufactures while minimising the impact on Australian production capacity and maintaining Australian capability. It is important to note at this point that Chinese officials are very eager to describe the potential outcomes of the ETA as 'Doha round - plus', meaning that the potential for an Agreement is motivated by willingness to deliver ahead of schedule the Outcomes of that round of WTO trade talks. Labor welcomes this continued commitment to multilateral trade outcomes. There are many areas of complementarity that China is keen to develop with Australia too that makes the most of our inherent strengths. Identifying mutual opportunities as well as understanding respective sensitivities. For Australia, the relative smallness of our economy having strong linkages with an economy as large as China's can potentially assist Australia to improve our dismal export performance and help Australian businesses achieve the scale of production necessary to access other large overseas exports markets. Therefore Chinese market access for Australia's exports and access by Australian businesses to do business in China are the priority issues. China's growth is extraordinary and while there is a push to take the heat out fo the growth it will continue to be very strong. 8 44 This graph is source from the China Facts and Fi.ures 2004 Publication. 2 China is subject to a WTO time-frame which requires the opening of domestic markets to foreign competition. However the practical experience of many businesses is that many non-specific, non-tariff trade barriers remain. Therefore any other mechanism available to the Chinese Government to give expression to progress in opening their economy becomes very important. Granting of MES is one such way. There is a well organised group of Australian Businesses operating in Beijing. The China-Australia Chamber of Commerce (Austcham) was founded in 1996 and operates as a not-for-profit private sector organisation. Austcham Beijing is part of a wider network in China, with Chambers operation in Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Austcham Beijing published their '2004 Business Issues Paper' in August of 2004. This document outlines the Chambers' views and opinions about the operation of Australian business in China. This document was brought to the ALP delegation's attention during the meeting in Beijing. 'Austcham Beying intends that the Business Issues Paper becomes a resource relied on by Australian political and public service leaders in their negotiations and advocacy with their Chinese counterparts. To this end the paper represent an important analysis of experiences of Australian business in China. For example, the effect on the limitations imposed on business scope at establishment present a clear barrier to expansion. The approval process of business scope is described as inconsistent across regions and not transparent, making it difficult for business to accurately assess their risk. This issue of scope was described to me by an Australian business operator in Shanghai as a symptom of Municipal Governments' 'quota' system for the establishment of new businesses. Apparently (not confirmed by government officials) there are defined numbers of new business registrations that have to be met to achieve policy goals. Therefore a business registration that is really for the purpose of expanding an existing business still counts in achieving this goal. Hence the 2 CHINA Facts and Figures 2004. New Star Publishers, Booklet and CD ROM 3Message from Executive Committee - Business Issues paper Austcham Beijing 2004 Page 5 9 145 limitations on business scope may be at least partially explained by this local application of Chinese industry development policy. Another issue that was brought to the forefront of discussion was the protection of intellectual property. Many business representatives believe that the loss of IP and the inability to pursue effective legal remedies in the Chinese judicial system is a major inhibitor to investment in China. The AIG have also raised this issue as one that the Howard Government need to address in the context of negotiations. The Austcham Business Issues 2004 paper goes into great detail about this and other issues. It would serve as a practical guide for the Howard Government to address barriers to business if they choose to use it. For Australian business, the ability to tap into China's manufacturing capability combined with access to the Chinese domestic market for Australian manufactures represents to of the most important opportunities to secure Australia's growth during the next 30 years when the Chinese economy asserts its presence. This opportunity exists because China's imports are also increasing significantly. So the Australian Government has a responsibility to vigorously pursue the interests of Australian businesses' in this regard, primarily because the identification and expansion of these export opportunities may give the Australian manufacturing sector the boost it needs to not only maintain current employment but expand operations in Australia This graph is source from the China Facts and Figures 2004 Publication.' Competing with China on price is already very difficult and the most recent study into ' comparative labour costs shows that the hourly cost of production in China is less than 5% than Australia (reference). However, manufacturing in Australia has been subject to these competitive pressures for some time and a combination of public policy that supported restructuring and innovation under the previous Labor Government and the continuation of strategic industry support has seen sectors like the automotive sector continue to perform beyond expectation. In the context of continuing investment in manufacturing infrastructure in China and their policy of creating the whole supply chain capability in a common geographic cluster, timely and targeted action to secure Australian suppliers a place in these supply chains is required. This 'local' or micro approach to facilitate business in China is necessary to create meaningful export opportunities for Australian companies. This approach also addresses the general complaint of many foreign 4 CHINA Facts and Figures 2004. New Star Publishers, Booklet and CD ROM 10 146 businesses: that they have to deal with different rules or different interpretations of laws in different cities and provinces. This local approach also sits comfortably with Chinese business culture, where in the absence of robust and enforceable contract law, a very high status is placed on personal relationships, honour and trust. This highlights existing Australian policy bottlenecks and limitations. For example, Austrade are well established in China but are typically under resourced for this kind of approach. Further, unless their business networks with both Australian and Chinese companies are up to date and paid regular attention any they value they add is undermined anyway. In conclusion, China is set to ascend to the number two position behind the US as a global economic power. Australia's best interests are served by maximising the opportunities that exist right now for a closer trade and political relationship. This means a strategic policy emphasis for value-add manufactures made in Australia to be exported to China as their consumer market continues to grow. China has enormous and growing capability and massive scale of operations. However imports are growing too and careful analysis of these trends in the context of the negotiation of a Free Trade Agreement could benefit Australian workers and companies in the long term. Observations The celebration of the Chinese Lunar New Year gives a glamorous impression to a first-time visitor to China such as myself. Beyond the visual impact this visit has confirmed to me that China is a truly enigmatic nation, with its cultural mystique and growing economic power. As more and more Chinese cultural content makes its way into the western mainstream media, interest from Australia will continue to grow in the people, their lives and their history. Long standing cultural exports such as Chinese herbal remedies have helped open our minds to a more holistic way thinking about the challenges of life. I have been struck by the sublime symbolism that pervades all aspects of Chinese etiquette, social mores and physical environment. It makes one's immediate environment and personal interactions a book to be read. I think being able to read this book' and drawing its meaning will help me to understand how things work in China. The challenge is applying this knowledge to one's conduct and participation in Chinese culture and business. This challenge is very real for many Australian businesses operating in China, Many administrative processes del' foreign de-codification yet the same administration continues to facilitate the fastest economic growth of the times. Labor welcomed the initiatives of the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Beijing in preparing a comprehensive analysis of the constraints on foreign businesses and some useful recommendation on how political leaders in Australia can help. II 147 China's outward focus in the 21a century is an invitation to explore more deeply the Chinese culture and way of life. More than any other event the Beijing Olympics in 2008 is being used to great effect as a platform for engagement. My meeting with the Beijing Olympic Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG) Sailing Committee in Qingdao highlight how focussed this effort is. Qingdao is a substantial city in Chinese terms, with a population of seven million people. It faces the Yellow Sea to the east and south and the urban area covers 1,102 square kilometres. The city of Qingdao, as host to the Olympic regatta, moved their port from the city to across the bay to make room for the Olympic sailing facilities. This required a massive investment and has resulted in one of the largest single port facilities in the world. The far sighted nature of this major investment stretches across Qingdao's ambitions to be a centre for leisure and recreation, hence building their tourism potential as well as continuing to break records in the efficiency of port facilities.

There is an enthusiasm within China to establish closer political links with Australia reflecting the rapid developments in the trade and economic relationship. The Visit of President Hu Jintou to Australia in October 2003 and planned visit of Prime Minister Howard to China in April 2005 are important steps in consolidating the political relationship. The bilateral trade and economic relationship is developing well. Driven by China's growing demand for Australian exports particularly energy, commodities and agricultural products. Although the trade is broadening with increasing Chinese demands for Australian services including education, tourism and financial services. Australia is well regarded within China as a reliable supplier of high quality products right across the range of trade. There is high level official support within China for beginning formal FTA talks with Australia following the completion of the joint-scoping study between our two countries. It is expected that formal FTA negotiations will be announced during Prime Minister Howard's visit to China in April. 'S2 sincerely Warren Sn. don Member fo Lingiari \u00e2\u00a2 It is anticipated that an FTA will create significant opportunities for a further broadening of the trade and economic relationship, greater two-way investment, joint ventures and closer cooperation- including in manufacturing and agriculture. China is sensitive about the potential impact of an FTA on their agriculture sector, noting that 900 million people live in rural and regional areas. The delegation took those comments on board but noted the relatively small size of Australia's agriculture exports when compared to Chinese production and demand and also the sensitivity of agriculture in Australia. Particularly, the need to open new export markets to ensure that Australian regional communities continue to have strong international demand for their products. China highlighted its request for greater access to Australia's textile clothing and footwear market in light of Australia's tariffs on those products. The Delegation noted the significant structural reform that has occurred in Australia's TCF industry and the need to ensure it remains a competitive supplier of products. The opportunity for closer cooperation and investment in this sector was discussed. (lv) Conclusion: Information obtained from the visit provided valuable input into the development of Labor's approach to a possible FTA with China. Following the visit, Labor has considered the implications of an FTA with China and has outlined publicly its policy position. Labor has adopted a positive disposition to an FTA with China reflecting the opportunities this will provide for Australian business and the potential for closer integration with the world's largest fastest growing economy. An ETA will also pose challenges for Australian industry. These challenges must be taken into account when assessing the overall FTA package when negotiations are concluded to ensure that the ETA is genuinely in Australia's national interest.

The Conference took place on the 26 and 27 February in Dili East Timor. This enabled me to travel from Darwin to East Timor on the 25 February and return on the 27 February 2005. KSTL is the peak trade union organisation in East Timor and play a crucial role in co-ordinating the work and development of the unions as well making representation to the East Timorese Government on Industrial policy and outcomes. In his letter of invitation, the President of KSTL, Mr Jose da Costa, stated that the congress will be very important considering the inconsistency of the East Timor Government in implementing the labour law. The organisation of collective policy development and action is a fundamental international right. Many unionists from Australia attended the Conference in order to assist with the further progress of the trade union movement and to assist the workers of East Timor to improve the skills needed to improve their wages and conditions. The main agenda items included a revision of the constitution, a debate on the new strategy to respond to the current situation as well as an election for President and General Secretary for the coming four years. During the Conference, I had an opportunity to address the delegates. This provided me with an opportunity to congratulate the elected representatives of KSTL and outline the many challenges that face the trade union movement not only in East Timor but also in Australia. Electorate Office: P0 Box 946 Palmerston NT 0831 tel. 088931 0830 Office: Parliament 6277 3661 In a developing country such as East Timor there are many challenges in developing an industrial base and a strong agricultural market supported by a professional public service that provides education and health programs. Crucial to this is the organisation of the workforce and the rights of workers such as proper wages, and decent conditions, protection under the law and the enforcement of a safe workplace. During the Conference I was able to meet and talk to representatives from APHEDA in Australia about the work they are currently undertaking in East Timor. This includes projects such as the East Timor Nurses Association and the Teachers Association, Vocational Training Centre, Public Service Capacity Building, Electrical trades development, Carpentry Skills Development and the Community Radio and Women's' Organisations. There was much interest in the position of Australia on the negotiations of the Timor Sea maritime boundaries. My discussions and dialogue with representatives of the East Timorese Government reiterated that progress was slow and impeded the projected outcomes and long term benefits that were expedited from the many projects being developed in these waters. Prime Minster Alkatiri opened the conference expressing his support for the trade union movement in the country and outlining the current direction of the government in developing the labour law. I had a brief chance to talk to him about the situation regarding the negotiations of the boundaries and he certainly expressed a desire for these to progress on a more regular basis and with a genuine desire for Australia to recognise the crucial link between the economic state of the country and the importance to have these negotiations resolved. It needs to be recognised that there are many Australians playing a key role in the development of East Timor but there is a lot that this country could continue to do in ensuring that our support is maintained not only in financial terms but in various ways such as providing a commitment to training and development. The trade union movement in East Timor has grown and will continue to develop through the support of the ACTU and a large number of affiliates. This support is appreciated and acknowledged and will continue to play a key role in protecting and advancing workers rights as is their international right.

Itinerary: Please find attached. Key meetings and outcomes/findings: Beringer Blass is a company owned by Australian company Fosters and whilst on the trip we met with several winery and operation managers whereby I could compare their operations with my knowledge of the Australian wine industry. Australia can be proud of its handling and unloading facilities, however in regard to water recycling, waste water re-use and final disposal we can learn much from our US counterparts. The wine tourism industry in Napa Valley is much more developed than Australian wine tourism areas, possibly due to the larger population and economy. The industry appeared to be more motivated to work with university researchers to help progress the industry. They have also developed alternative uses for wine grapes such as liqueurs and jams. )i\\ i Fy Ekot00ot. Offi ces November 2005 is A Pit, 160 Electorate Offices Murray Bridge 7 Adelo,de Rood 00(02) 6277 8541 P.5eoIoer(oph.goo.ou Entail Harvesting methods in Australia are more advanced than those used in the USA, with greater use of mechanical harvesting. Delivery of grapes to wineries is also much more advanced in Australia. Both Australia and the USA are experimenting with new technologies such as the stevlon or 'screw cap' and having similar successes. It was interesting to learn about the US wine market which has a larger home base and is therefore less reliant on exports than Australia. The US has never exceeded 20% exports, whereas comparatively Australia is exporting 60% of all production and this is increasing. The US has a large low value market of wine selling from US$3 to US$7 per bottle across a large variety, whereas the Australian market is at least double this price. The US does have a lower wine tax regime and it was interesting to note that Australian wines sold for a lower price in the US than at home, almost certainly due to the lower tax regime and the removal of Australian taxes for our wine exports. The Lodi Valley visit was interesting in that it compared more with the Riverland region in my electorate of Barker, with wines less recognised for quality and with higher yields. Ten years ago the grape growers of Lodi Valley struck a compulsory levy for promoting their region and through this they spend more than US$1 million every year. They are convinced of the merits of this spending and believe that it has been worthwhile. There were many stories in relation to an industry (not government) sponsored vine pull which occurred two years ago in response to the wine glut, similar to that which Australia is facing at the present. The irony of the US experience is that less than two years later vines were being replanted in the very same area. Whilst the wine industry used many similar varieties the Australian wine industry, they also grow another high yielding variety called Zifandel which is used for lower priced wines. I do not believe that Australia should use this variety and believe they should continue to concentrate on the production of quality wine. There is no doubt that there is a greater involvement and partnership between industry and in the US than we have here in Australia. The 161 0 PIP A E,neii P.5eo6er@oph.gou.ou YO4J45 sincere Patrick Secker MP Federal Member for Barker Land Grant System used in the USA has helped to further develop this partnership. The marketing success of the Australian Yellow Tail wines has been phenomenal and as one America said 1 picked that wine because of the cute Aussie critters on the label. Conclusion: Whilst it was a short intensive trip, I feel it was very worthwhile and gave me an opportunity to compare the industries and markets of the USA and Australia. It was heartening to see our wines compete well on price and quality, especially the red varieties.

Confirmation of purpose a. The purpose of this visit was to: The purpose of my visit to Cambodia was to attend the 33 d Williamsburg Conference: \"21' Century Asia: Imagining the Future\". On my way to the Conference, I was able to have a number of meetings with the Thai Foreign Ministry on the morning of 21 March regarding regional security and political and economic architecture. Upon arriving in Thailand on my way to the Williamsburg Conference in Cambodia, I received a briefing at the Australian Embassy which was attended by Ambassador William Paterson, Deputy Head of Mission Perry Head, Trade Commissioner Ian Davey and Political Counsellor, Stephen Gee. I then travelled to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet with the Director General of the Department of ASEAN Affairs, Mr Kitti Wasinondh. 653 5750 En,II - KnvInRodd.Mpoh ,oxo Following this meeting, I met with the Secretary-General of the National Security Council, General Winai Phattiyakul. At the Williamsburg Conference in Cambodia (which was held from the Tuesday through to the Thursday), I participated in a number of sessions which I found valuable in my role as the Shadow Foreign Minister. On the Tuesday morning I participated in a session titled: \"After the Tsunami: Critical Concerns Moving Forward\". This session addressed, among other things, the following questions: \u00e2\u00a2 Three months after the crisis, what are the areas of greatest concern and need as countries in South and Southeast Asia move forward in the rebuilding and reconstruction phase? \u00e2\u00a2 How has the disaster created opportunities for improved relations in the Indian Ocean Community, the region and the US? \u00e2\u00a2 What has been the impact of the disaster on how countries in the region view the United States, India, China, Japan and western countries? I found this session important given Australia's role in the reconstruction of Tsunami-affected areas in South East Asia. The Executive Director of UNICEF Carol Bellamy, Indonesia Association of Community Empowerment representative Emil Salim and Regional Representative for the Henry Dunant Center for Humanitarian Dialogue Michael Vatikiotis gave excellent presentations and I was able to gain a better understanding of the challenges facing Asia in the aftermath of the Tsunami. In the afternoon I participated in a session titled: \"The Future of ASEAN and its Relationship with the Rest of Asia\". I found this to be a very useful session in furthering my understanding on the role of ASEAN in the region and its future. In addition, the session also addressed the upcoming East Asian Summit and its implications for the region. Of note, the session covered the following topics: \u00e2\u00a2 What are the challenges and prospects faced by Cambodia in its efforts to build its economy, to build democratic institutions and good governance, to achieve equity and social justice and to balance its quest for national reconciliation with the international community's demand for justice for the Khmer Rouge leaders? How is the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk affecting the stability and unity of Cambodia? \u00e2\u00a2 What is the current situation of Islam in Southeast Asia? What is the role (if any) of Islam in the conflicts in the Southern Philippines, 2 Southern Thailand and bombings in Indonesia? Who is winning the battle for the soul of Islam in Southeast Asia? \u00e2\u00a2 What is the impact of leadership changes in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia on their respective countries and on ASEAN as a whole? What is ASEAN's vision for the future? \u00e2\u00a2 What efforts are being undertaken by Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and other countries in the region to accelerate economic development in the Mekong region? How are they working together to create a shared network of transport, electricity, trade, tourism, human resource training and health care that will allow for sustainable development? \u00e2\u00a2 What is the state of relations between ASEAN and China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand? I delivered an address to the Conference during this session titled: \"The 2005 East Asian Summit: A stepping stone to the creation of an East Asian Community and its foreign policy implications for Australia\". That speech can be found at the conclusion of this travel report. On the Wednesday morning I participated in session on the relationship between the United States and Asia. During this session a number of critical questions were discussed, including: \u00e2\u00a2 How will the Administration in the next four years order its priorities in Asia generally, and more specifically with respect to India, China, Japan, and South Korea? \u00e2\u00a2 How is the Administration likely to deal with security concerns with respect to North Korea, Afghanistan, and terrorism in the next four years. \u00e2\u00a2 How does Asia view the global prospects for peace? What actions would Asian leaders recommend to further those prospects both by the US and by leaders in the region? \u00e2\u00a2 Looking forward, how do we see the likely role of the U.S. in Asia ten years from now? In the afternoon the Conference addressed public health and social issues in South East Asia. This was a valuable session, particularly as it provided me with an opportunity to increase my understanding of the potential impact of Avian Flu on the Asian population and economy. We also discussed questions such as: 3 \u00e2\u00a2 Beyond the impact from the tsunami disaster, what are the region's key social and transnational issues? What is being done to address these areas? What are the appropriate roles for the private, public and civil society sectors in addressing these problems? Are we winning or losing the war on AIDS in Asa? \u00e2\u00a2 How does HI V/AIDS fit in the context of broader public health challenges, including infectious diseases such as Tuberculosis, SARS, and Avian Influenza? \u00e2\u00a2 Five or ten years from now will we still be dealing with this same set of issues? On the Thursday morning we had an excellent session on the future of the Asian economy. Specifically this session addressed the impact of China, India and Japan on the economic success of Asia. Of note, the following questions were discussed: \u00e2\u00a2 What impact are China and India having on the way the region and the world does business? \u00e2\u00a2 As the world's second largest economy, what is Japan's plan for growth and engagement with the rest of Asia? \u00e2\u00a2 Is the expiration of the MFA having an impact on Asia's economies? What are the specific impacts on India and China? \u00e2\u00a2 What role are regional agreements playing in Asia? Are these arrangements \"building blocs\" or \"stumbling blocs\" toward Asian economic integration? \u00e2\u00a2 What factors might inhibit future economic growth in the region? Similarly what ideas/technologies might spark growth? The Conference ended with a session based on examining future scenarios for Asia. We discussed the forces that will shape the region in the next five to ten years as well as how these forces might interact to produce change and what scenarios governments and business can develop for the region from the interaction of these forces. b. Itinerary (see attached). 4 167 Conclusion This was a superb Conference and I found it very useful in assisting me in my role as the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was useful to be able to participate in a Conference with some of the region's leading government officials, business representatives and academics and explore many of the challenges currently facing Asia, as well as those challenges looming over the horizon. Given the economic, political and strategic importance of Asia to Australia, attending this Conference was extremely helpful in allowing me to better execute my parliamentary duties. I am more than happy to elaborate on any of the points above. I understand that knowingly giving false and misleading information is a serious offtnce.

(b) Itinerary: I confirm that I arrived In Geneva on Monday March 28 at 15.25, and departed on Saturday April 02 at 07.05. I arrived In Kuala Lumpur on Sunday April 03 at 06.05, and departed on Wednesday April 06 at 07.15. (II) Key Meetings and outcomes/findings Geneva My visit to Geneva was hosted and coordinated by the then Ambassador to the CHR. His Excellency Mike Smith and the staff of the Australian Mission. Their efforts to ensure a productive and stimulating visit were exceptional and I sin very grateful for their interest and support. As well as attendance at the various Items of the Commission, a number of separate meetings with other delegates and key Geneva-based NGOs (non government organisations) were arranged by the mission. I was advised on arrival that the Commission was running ahead of schedule, an unusual occurrence from all reports. I am sure this occurred In large part due to the reforms of meeting process and Level 3. 2-12 Macquarie Street Room S -94 Parramatta NSW 2150 Parliament House (PC Box CCI 8, Parramatta 2123) Canberra ACT 2600 Ph.

On day one, Tuesday 29 March I attended the morning meeting of the Australian team with the Ambassador at the Commission. As well as mission staff, the team Is supported by several student Interns during the period of the Commission. Making their own way to Geneva, they assist in research, attending meetings, contributing to reports of the days' events and a myriad of other tasks. As well as providing valued support to the mission staff this is a unique opportunity for the young Australian students and I was very interested to hear their views and discuss the work of the Commission with them. In turn, they presented me with some challenging questions on the nature of parliament and the political process. Tuesday was taken up with discussion of Items 9 (Question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world) and 10 (Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). These discussions included presentations by Special Rapporteurs on a range of human rights Issues. The Special Rapporteurs addressing the CHR included Professor Vitit Muntahbom from Thailand (the situation of human rights In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea); Mr Paul Hunt from New Zealand (the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health) and Mr Vernor Mu\u00c3\u00b1oz Vifialobos (the right to education). On each of the Items a list of speakers (members and observers, the latter group Including NGOs) was listed In the Order of the Day, the programme of each day's activity. At the same time as matters are proceeding in the Plenary meetings of the Commission, a number of other meetings are occurring, and their details are also listed in the Order of the Day. Some of these will be open, some private and some restricted to co-sponsors of certain resolutions. I attended a small number of these where possible and appropriate. Similarly, NGO events are also organised during the day. On Tuesday 29, I attended an NGO event on Human Rights In Nepal, organised by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), and co-sponsored by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. That event presented a number of Australian speakers Including Nick Howen, Secretary General of the ICJ and Nick Grono of the International Crisis Group (ICG).

Having previously visited Nepal on an overseas study journey I was Interested and disturbed to hear reports of the sharp decline In the human rights situation in Nepal. I have also taken up this Issue through the committee process In the parliament. The Ambassador provided me with a valuable opportunity to meet with Australian human rights advocates and experts based In Geneva or visiting Geneva for the 61St session over dinner. It was helpful to have their views on the work of the CHR, the challenges facing the organisation and the role of the groups they represented both during the CHR and more broadly. On Wednesday 30 March, discussions and contributions on Item 10 (Economic Social and Cultural Rights) continued In the Plenary Session of CHR. and both Special Rapporteurs and Independent Experts provided comment in several areas. In the afternoon of Wednesday 30 March, I attended separate meetings with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria and UNAIDS. At the Global Fund I met with Executive Director Professor Richard Feachem. I have since had the opportunity to meet Professor Feachem on his most recent visit to Australia and the region. I discussed Australia 's support of the Fund with Professor Feachem and the work of the fund In the Asia Pacific region In particular. We also discussed the long term funding challenges for the Fund and the recently held replenishment conference In Stockholm. At UNAIDS I met with Marie Odile Emond and Dr Victor Ortega. both Programme Development Advisers, In the Division for Asia Pacific and Middle East, Country and Regional Support Department. This provided an opportunity to discuss the activities of UNAIDS In the Asia Pacific, and the developing work of the Asia Pacific Leadership Forum on HlV-AIDS, based In Bangkok which was an Initiative of the Ministerial meeting attached to the 6th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, held In Melbourne in 2001. The message from this meeting was about the ability of UNAIDS to leverage relatively small resources to great effect In their work. Since these meetings I have taken up the chairmanship of the Australian Parliamentary Liaison Group on HIV-AIDS at the request of Health Minister the Hon Tony Abbott MP. I have consistently endeavoured to study the challenges of the AIDS pandemic In the Asia Pacific, and the work and responses of both governments and NGOs in meeting those challenges In my overseas study journeys. Meeting both UNAIDS and the Global Fund in their own headquarters was a very valuable opportunity to pursue those Issues.

Their delegation Included the Hon Dan McTeague P.C., MY, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Depute Marcel Gagnon, and Senator Ten)' Stratton, Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Ambassador again hosted a very Interesting and stimulating dinner focussing on health and human rights Issues in the Asia Pacific. With both Australian and Pacific representatives, the discussion was wide ranging including Australia/New 7valand cooperation In the region, the challenge of HIV, the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands and other matters. On Thursday 31 March the mission had arranged two roundtable meetings with the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), respectively. At the International Federation I met with Ibrahim Osman. Director of the Policy and Relations Division, Malika Ait-Mohaxned Parent. Head of the Movement, Principles and Values Department, Charles Evans, Operations/Programme Support, Asia and Pacific Department and Johan Schaar, Special Representative. We discussed the response to the December 2004 tsunami, and the processes by which local decision making Is fundamental to the work and effective response of the IFRC. It was noted that the IFRC is present In all tsunami affected countries and as well as the emergency response will continue their traditional Red Cross activities in areas such as water and sanitation. The IFRC representatives also detailed some of their longer term strategic planning for countries in this region, given the propensity for natural disaster and the continuing challenges faced In the region. The discussion also centred on some interesting areas of philosophy behind the work of the IFRC, their core principles and values and work that had been developed around the concept of 'humanitarian values'. At the ICRC. I met with Edith Baeriswyl. the Head of Operations for South East Asia and the Pacific. her Deputy Florence Sechaud and Sylvie Van Lammeren, Legal Adviser to the Operations Legal Division. They outlined the work of the ICRC and its structure In the region. The operational work of the ICRC In the Asia Pacific is focussed on protection activity, for example in prisons, labor camps and regions of instability. We discussed their work in Burma specifically, which Is of significant interest to me as a co-chair of the Parliamentary Group for Burma. Much of the work of regional delegations is focussed on 'humanitarian diplomacy'. Given my interest in Timor L'Este, the ICRC representatives also outlined details of their work in addressing the question of the 'missing.

The ICRC has 2500 files which are estimated to be only a third of the potential number of missing. Those files are intended to be handed to the local Red Cross in due course. In relation to International humanitarian law (IHL), and the role of the ICRC as the guardian of IHL, the legal division of the organisatlon has thirty lawyers on Its team. Their teams operate across three areas - thematic e.g. customary international law, conduct of hostilities, human rights; secondly, mines and arms, in particular lobbying In relation to the Conventions; and thirdly, advisory services which encompasses working closely with authorities, consideration of the Implementation of international humanitarian law e.g. ratification of Conventions and Protocols. They also provide legal advisors to operations both from Geneva and to delegations in the field. The mission convened a lunch roundtable to which a wide range of Australian representatives in Geneva was Invited. In a free flowing discussion the work of the CHR. key human rights Issues and the role of the parliamentary sub-committee on Human Rights was discussed. The lunch meeting provided the stimulus and Initiative for a public hearing held In Canberra in August this year to discuss CHR reform. Attended by NGOs It was a valuable opportunity for members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade Human Rights Sub Committee to hear the views of major Australian NGOs on the CHR reform proposals in advance of the summit in New York. A report of the hearing was tabled in the parliament Outside the plenary session I met with US Congressman Chris Smith (New Jersey). Congressman Smith Is Chairman of the Africa, Global Human Rights and International Operations Sub Committee of the International Relations Committee. We discussed responses to a number of human rights Issues, and particularly human trafficking. I also met with Professor Chris Sidoti, Director of International Services for Human Rights (ISHR) and interns attached to the ISHR. We discussed the work of the LSHR and parliamentary and political processes in the human rights arena. On Friday the CHR went into closed session for Item 9b- 1503 (country situations discussed under confidential procedures). Members only are allowed to attend this session. Australia and Poland co-hosted a side event on Good Governance on Friday 1 April. Entitled Practical Approaches to Good Governance and Human Rights, I chaired the panel comprising Senator Zblgblew Romaszewskl, Professor Vitit Muntarbhorn and Mrs Ethel Sigimanu. Senator Romaszewski was formerly an academic. In the 1970s he began a long campaign of activism. He was jailed for his efforts in the Level -3, 2-12 Macquarie Street Room S -94 Parramatta NSW 2150 Parliament House (PC Box CCI 8, Parramatta 2123) Canberra ACT 2600 Ph.

The High Commission arranged a short programme for me and I am grateful for their assistance and highly professional support on my first visit to Malaysia. On Monday 4Apr11. I met with Datin Rose Ismail from the Institute of Strategic and International Studies at the commencement of my programme. A journalist by training. Datin Ismail has a strong interest In counter terrorism policy, In social behaviour, In Islam and in issues affecting women. She discussed many of the Interesting 175 Room S 1-94 Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600 Ph (02) 6277 3810 Fax (02) 6277 3811 mariseSmarisepayne.com Manse Payne Liberal Senator for New South Wales 4 AUCtRALIA & 1980s. He Is a human rights activist In Poland and chairs the Polish Senate's Human Rights and Rule of Law Committee. Professor Muntarbhom Is a Professor of Law at Chulalongkom University In Bangkok. He was rapporteur of the Expert Seminar In Good Governance In Seoul In September 2004 and was recently awarded the UNESCO Prize for Human Rights Education. The third panelist, Ms Ethel Siglinanu is the Permanent Secretary In the Department of National Reconciliation and Peace In the Solomon Islands. Ms Sigimanu was In Geneva with the assistance of AusAID. The panel discussion was very stimulating. It was particularly Interesting to see the significant level of Interest In the presentation by Ms Sigimanu on the situation In the Solomon Islands, and more specifically, the RAMS! Intervention. To participants In a UN based discussion, this was a unique opportunity to discuss an Intervention, which Involved both military, law enforcement and civil engagement, and was not borne of the United Nations. Australia's role In enabling Ms Sigirnanu to attend the CHR was very Important. The Pacific Is not well represented at the CHR. and It Is even more Important that a story such as that of the Solomons Is told. In her address to the Plenary In Item 11 (Civil and Political Rights) and In the Good Governance side event, Ms Sigimanu drew to the attention of members and observers current events In the Pacific, the role of women In the region and the role and capacity of a multi national Intervention In effecting change In a community like the Solomon Islands. My final meeting was with the Ambassador and Mrs Louise Arbour. the High Commissioner for Human Rights. This meeting provided an opportunity to discuss the work of the CHR, Its effectiveness and relevance and the upcoming reform discussions. The funding and operations of the Office of the High Commissioner were also discussed. Australia contributes to the annual funding of the Office and particularly supports the work of the Office In the Pacific region. Malaysia Manse Payne Liberal Senator for New South Wales changes taking place in Malaysia In recent years. She Is primarily Involved In the Centre for Social and Cultural Development, which allows her to focus on life In Malaysia, on education, activity, community engagement and the Impact of progress on the nation. Datin Ismail was also a founding member of Sisters In Islam. a research based organisation which focuses on gender Issues in society and religion. I found this meeting with Datin Ismail a very useful beginning to my time in Kuala Lumpur and the range of meetings ahead. I met with the High Commissioner James Wise and senior mission staff to be briefed on key Issues In the Australia/Malaysia relationship. My visit occurred Just days before the visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Badawl to Australia. It was very interesting to read the commentary prior to that visit in local newspapers. The briefing covered domestic and foreign policy issues and engagement between the countries in particular on anti corruption, counter terrorism and immigration. Malaysia places a very high premium on stability. To that end, It Is noteworthy that there are restrictions placed on freedom of the media and much of the media Is in government ownership or control. Civil society Is also limited in Its capacity, particularly because it Is poorly resourced and under skilled. The community is described as enjoying 'racial harmony, but not integration. There are clear separations between Malay, Chinese and Indian communities. The Malaysian economy Is strong and growing, but will face challenges from China In the coming years. There Is a need to lift productivity, which is recognised at the necessary levels of government however implementation Is problematic. Australia's engagement with Malaysia has a strong basis In education, both currently and previously through such Initiatives as the Colombo Plan. This briefing was also a useful basis for the discussions of following days. I attended lunch with members of the Malaysian parliament, including several I had met on their earlier visit to Australia as part of a Select Committee programme. Lunch was attended by S.K Devaxnany. Dato' Che Min Che Ahmad and Donald Peter MoJuntin. This was a useful and timely opportunity to consolidate relationships between members of the parliaments and was followed the next day by a very interesting visit to the parliament Itself. I also met with Puan Zainah Anwar, the Sisters in Islam Executive Director. Their work concentrates in women's rights In the Islamic framework, and fundamental Issues of liberty. They run a public education programme which includes both study sessions and Level 3,2-12 Macquarie Street Room S 1 -94 Parramatta House (P0 Box CCI 2123) Canberra ACT 2600 Ph.

They Issue publications for awareness raising and produce question and answer booklets on equality, domestic violence, polygamy and family planning. In terms of funding, the Sisters in Islam receive local support and funds from International foundations. Puan Anwar described their relationship with government as one of advocacy, and where necessary, calling for law reform. They have submitted papers to the Human Rights caucus of the parliament, which operates on cross-party lines and are strong supporters of that caucus and its members, Including ministers. We discussed specific aspects of their work, Including their statements on moral policing, polygamy and other issues. Their public education programme is very Important to their work, and they have extended in recent times to international training programmes on women's rights In Islam. Sisters in Islam Is also a member of the Joint Action Group, which comprises seven women's NGOs. They meet regularly, take the lead In public debate In different issues and submit joint memoranda to government on key Issues. Sisters has informal contact with female members of parliament In Malaysia, and there is currently no women's caucus In the parliament. They are optimistic one may be formed in the future. The women who run and support Sisters in Islam are exceptional people. From my observations, they stand up for the rights of women in what can be a highly challenging environment, and they brook no opposition. They are strong, committed, exacting, well prepared and ready to advocate for their cause. Their work is Inspiring. I visited the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Deputy Representative in Malaysia, Ms Caroline Verma. Malaysia Is not a party to the Refugee Convention. The main refugee population is Indonesian (from Aceh), from Burma and stateless people. The registered number is over 36,000 and many more are unregistered. UNHCR spends a great deal of time searching for durable solutions for the refugee problem. That may cover the gambit of temporary local solutions, then return for some, particularly the Acehnese, and for others, resettlement is proposed. There are many arrests of 'unlawful' refugees In Malaysia. Ms Verma advised that the law makes no differentiation between refugees and other illegal foreigners. UNHCR has been in extensive discussion with the government on the manner in which these matters are approached. The law and enforcement thereof Is complex and In recent times there have been crackdowns on unlawful foreigners. I Level 3,2-12 Manse Payne Liberal Senator for New South Wales AUSTR*UA The High Commission arranged a dinner meeting with the Deputy President of the National Human Rights Society, En.Mallk Imtiaz Sarwar. The Society is Malaysia's longest standing human rights NGO. It supports Individuals detained under the Internal Security Act and those affected by other human rights violations. On Tuesday 5 April, I attended a meeting with the Chairman of the Malaysian Human Rights Commission Tan Sri Abu Talib Othman. In my estimates and other committee work. I meet regularly with representatives of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission In Australia and this was a useful opportunity to meet with the chairman of a similar organisation. The chairman discussed the operation of the Internal Security Act and Its Impact on human rights. The Commission had called for a different legal approach to be taken. We also discussed the operation of media laws and a lack of media freedom In Malaysia. The Chairman briefed me on the inquiries undertaken by the Commission and the government responses to those Inquiries. The chairman noted that he believed the commission had been effective In assisting Malaysians to know their rights, and also In encouraging police to be more cautious In the use of their powers. The Commissions powers enable It to receive complaints from individuals, to pursue an inquiry Itself, can require evidence to be given on oath and can recommend action to authorities. It is independent In the exercise of Its functions. Members are appointed by the King on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Terms are for two years and members are eligible for reappointment. The Commission currently has 17 members. 4 of whom are women. It was described by the chairman as multi-racial. We discussed specific Issues Including moral policing, the Islamic Law Act, the judiciary, the role of the Human Rights Caucus In the parliament and the government's proposed Inter-Faith Commission. I next met the Director General of the South East Asian Regional Centre for Counter Terrorism (SEARCC11 Dato' Zainal Abidin bin Zaln. I have pursued counter terrorism Issues on a number of visits to the region In recent years, and again I acknowledge and thank the Australian Federal Police for their support and assistance In these discussions. The AFP places a significant priority on this task in the region and work In partnership with key nations to develop effective responses. SEARCCT Is focused on collaboration - currently they are working with Australia on document security. They are also working with the UK and Russian Federation. I was advised that later In the year an Austrac course on counter terrorism financing Is being Level 3, 2-12 Macquarie Street 178 Room S 1-94 Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600 Ph (02) 6277 3810 Fax (02) 6277 3811 marise@marisepayne.com Manse Payne Liberal Senator for New South Wales I 'll AUSTRALIA conducted at SEARCCT. They have received lecturers from Japan, Canada, the US and elsewhere. The Director General referred to the challenges In the region, and relationships with other countries. He raised southern Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. In 2004, he noted that 600 people were trained through SEARCCT. Although there are three centres in the region, his assessment is that is probably not sufficient for the task ahead. However, there is contact between the centres and effort made to avoid duplication. He emphasised that It is Important to maintain a clear perspective that terrorism Is an International phenomenon, not simply an Islamic one. I was very pleased to have the opportunity to meet with Datuk Paduka Marina Mahathir, President of the Malaysian AIDS Council. In view of the upcoming 7th ICAAP In Kobe, we discussed the conference and Australia's involvement. We discussed at length emerging aspects of the spread of HIV in the Asia Pacific, and questions of mandatory testing, harm reduction in relation to injecting drug users and other issues. We also addressed the activities of the Global Fund in the region and the developing work of the Asia Pacific Leadership Forum on HIV-AIDS, based In Bangkok. As noted earlier I visited the Malaysian parliament in session and observed a very dynamic Question and Answer session. I was hosted on a comprehensive tour of the parliament by S.K Devamnany MP, including members' offices and lounge areas. I met briefly with a number of members including Mrs Chong Eng of the Opposition Party DAP. We discussed the difficulties of resourcing and staffing for opposition parties, the challenge of obtaining media coverage, particularly In an environment where media freedom is an Issue. Mrs Eng was most articulate in identifying the difficulties faced by a party such as hers. We also talked about women in parliament. This was my final meeting for the Malaysian component of my journey. (iii) Conclusion As indicated throughout the text above, many of the meetings and visits I pursued on this overseas study journey are consistent with issues I have Identified in the parliament over a long period. As chair of the Human Rights sub committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade an opportunity to visit and participate in the 61St session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights gave me a unique perspective on the discussions later in the year on the reform of the CHR and its role in general. I think the sub committee's report to the Parliament and the Hansard of the hearing have provided valuable Input to the process. In particular, It Level 3,2-12 Macquarie Street Room S -94 Parramatta (P0 Box CCI 2123) Canberra ACT 2600 9893 3810 AUSTRAOA was gratifying to be able to take a suggestion from my meetings In Geneva and put it Into action In the Australian parliament. On HIV-AIDS, In both Geneva and Kuala Lumpur I took the opportunity to obtain the most current Information on the activities of the Global Fund and UNAIDS. and seek briefings on work In the\u00e2\u00a2 region while In Malaysia. Since taking up the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Liaison Group on HIV-AIDS I will also be able to pursue those matters In that capacity. It Is Important for Australian members of parliament to establish and maintain relationships with regional colleagues: to evince an interest In their parliamentary processes, their cultures and responsibilities. My first visit to Malaysia will I hope go some way to effecting that result. As Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee I am keenly aware of the Importance of the counter terrorism response In the region. I have discussed extensively with the AFP their role In the region and visits to organisations such as SEARCCT assist In my understanding and knowledge of this work. The effectiveness of such visits Is enhanced by the assistance and support of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and their officers. I would like to record my thanks to Ambassador Mike Smith in Geneva and High Commissioner James Wise in Malaysia for the support provided to me by their mission staff. I note that in accordance with Clause 9.5 of the Remuneration Tribunal Determination No 14 of 2003 a copy of this statement may be obtained by you upon request by any Member or Senator. I also note that this statement may be tabled In Parliament at your discretion. Yours sincerely.

Developments in health prevention activities; 2. Developments in health and medical workforce design, training, recruitment and retention strategies; 3. Health reform processes and outcomes; 4. Public/private partnerships in health; and 5. Innovations in after hours care. I also undertook other activities relevant to my electorate and some general parliamentary dialogue. I report on each of these matters below. Developments in health promotion and illness prevention activities 5.30 pm Tuesday 29 March - Paris Meeting with Mr Pascal Melihan Chenin, Head of the Prevention Bureau for Addictive Practices, Dr Catherine Bernard & Dr Dominique Martin, Prevention, Health Program and Risk Management. 12.30 pin Thursday 7 April - Cardiff Lunch with Mr Ceri Breeze, Public Health Strategy Division, Welsh Assembly Government When Australia has focussed on health promotion and illness prevention activities, it has done an excellent job. While more work needs to be done to further reduce smoking rates, Australia's anti-tobacco campaigns have enjoyed considerable success and Australia's Sun Smart campaigns are an effective behavioural change model. However, Australia's health care system lacks a systematic focus on health promotion and illness prevention activities and such a focus is becoming more important as the burden of disease shifts from infectious diseases to chronic conditions, many of which are preventable. As part of my research I wanted to ascertain what other countries were doing in the health promotion and illness prevention area. Clearly, France faces greater problems than Australia with tobacco and arguably with alcohol consumption but a lesser problem with obesity. I found that France's health promotion and illness prevention activities, like Australia's, tend to be episodic and encounter considerable resistance from those who produce unhealthy 182 products. Notably though, the French are intending to place a Foetal Alcohol Syndrome warning on wine bottles. While health department officials consider this is a decision which has already been made, political representatives I encountered thought the move likely to founder due to industry resistance. Whatever happens, this is an important case study for Australia to monitor, not only because of what might be learned about the effectiveness of the move but also because it has implications for the labelling of Australian wines exported to France. Wales is taking a much more systematic approach to health promotion and illness prevention activities. The health status of the Welsh people is lower than that of the English, partly due to relative disadvantage and partly due to the legacy of the coal mining practices of the past. Against that background, the Welsh Assembly Government has explicitly adopted maximising the health of the Welsh people as its first health objective and securing access to services as their second objective. That is they have been brave enough to put the health promotion and illness prevention objective first. This has led to the development of a program called Health Challenge Wales, which is about whole community ownership of the health promotion task as well as investments in preventative health measures. The effectiveness of this systemic measure needs to be monitored as does the managing of the inevitable political tension of putting promotion and prevention activities first. Developments in health and medical workforce design, training, recruitment and retention strategies 8.45 am Wednesday 30 March - Paris Meeting with Dr Anne-Mane Gallot, Head, Health Professionals Branch, Ministry of Health 12.45 pm Tuesday April - London Meeting with Mrs Deborah Mell or, Head, Workforce Capacity, Department of Health 10.00 am Wednesday 6 April - London Meeting with Dr Beverley Malone, General Secretary, Royal College of Nursing 01.15 pm Monday II April \u2014 Ottawa Meeting with Ms Peggy Taillon, Advocacy, Community Engagement and Privacy Officer, Ottawa Hospital 02.30 pm Monday II April - Ottawa Meeting with Dr Michael Brasau, Chief Executive Officer, Royal College of Surgeons 11.00 am Thursday 14 April - Victoria Meeting with Libby Posgate, Director, Physician Human Resources Management, Office of the Premier, Government of British Columbia I 83 3 Across the developed world, there are pressing issues about shortage of health and medical professionals. Each country I visited is seriously investigating and implementing new measures to ensure that sufficient health professionals are trained and retained. Each country at the moment is reliant on important overseas medical professionals, particularly doctors and nurses. The British Government has explicitly stated it will not seek to recruit doctors and nurses from countries to which the British Government gives foreign aid. While running a non-discriminatory migration system, this is an express attempt to address the ethical dilemma of developed countries stripping vitally needed medical workforce from the Third World. The European Union is involved in developing consistent training standards across the Union for medical professionals. Already there is considerable workforce mobility, including whole medical teams travelling from countries like Switzerland to the UK to perform elective surgery in order to address waiting list issues. However, each country I visited is not only addressing workforce numbers, but also workforce structure and design. In France, the health system is being restructured to put family physicians (the equivalent of GPs) as the gatekeepers of access to specialist care. Historically in France it has been possible for individuals to directly approach specialist. While this will still be possible, a direct approach to a specialist will receive a lower social insurance payment and attract a higher out of pocket cost than a referred visit. In the United Kingdom, the Blair Government is driving a workforce restructuring program called the Agenda for Change. This program is about creating career paths through hospitals including supporting non-medical staff to credential as nursing support staff and ultimately nurses. It includes support for nurses to continue training and achieve nurse consultant status. In addition issues like the NHS facilitating access to 24/7 childcare facilities are being tackled. The Agenda for Change enjoys the support of the British Medical Association. In Canada the Royal College of Surgeons, which represents all speciality areas is driving a re-consideration of which medical worker undertakes which task. For example, gastro-enterologists are considering whether scoping work historically performed by them could be delegated to a trained assist. This kind of innovative approach to workforce design questions enjoys the support of the Canadian Medical Association. Seeing these initiatives, one is left with the general impression that Australia is slow to address these important workforce design issues and that the Australian debate has been characterised by 'turf protection' rather than an openness to considering new and better ways of providing timely, efficient and quality care to patients. Much of the work being done overseas, including the work being driven by the medical profession itself in Canada, bears further study and consideration of its applicability to Australia.

As noted above, France is redesigning the way in which access to specialist occurs and it is innovating strongly in the use of new technology in hospitals. The United Kingdom has.a major NHS reform program under way including huge additional monetary investmes, workforce redesign as noted above and public/private partnerships as discussed below. It should be noted that as a result of devolution, the NHS in Wales and in Scotland is now free to develop in different directions to the English NHS and is doing so. However, the most interest system wide reform process was that undertaken in Canada. This example is one of particular relevance to Australia, because though the Canadian health system is differently structured, it has historically been beset with cost shifting and blame shifting between the national and provincial levels of government, in the way our health system has been beset with such problems between the Commonwealth and the States. Canada had a former Premier of one of its Provinces, Mr Roy Romanow, conduct a health reform process in Canada. Remarkably the incumbent Liberal Government selected Mr Romanow even though he was a member of another political party. Mr Romanow issued two reports, one in January 2002 and one in November 2002. His first report outlined four reform scenarios, keeping the status quo, engaging in some reform, increasing private sector involvement and making the system totally private. He then went out and talked to Canadians about what they thought. In 12 places across the country, a representative but randomly selected group of 40 citizens was asked to participate in forums defining what to do next with the Canadian health system. Mr Romanow conducted open consultations across the country to allow Canadians to speak. These hearings were televised live and had substantial viewing audiences. Mr Romanow's website recorded 35 million hits. The experts were consulted as well with 42 independent studies commissioned with all the work published and publicly accessible. To guarantee the independence of this research, Mr Romanow did not select the researchers himself, but had an independent panel do it. Overseas opinion was sought and Mr Romanow convened an expert OECD panel, an expert panel on public/private partnerships and an expert panel on cost drivers in health. No reform model is ever prefect. Mr Romanow's reforms were picked up in part, not in total. 4 But at least the Canadians have been prepared to take a long hard look at their health system. At least Canadians have had a say about what it is in their health system they value and what it is that should be changed. 6 It would be of merit to have Mr Romanow come to Australia and discuss his experience with health reform. Publiclprivate partnerships in health 1.45 pm Tuesday 5 April - London Meeting with Mr Chris Harris, Deputy Section Head, Capital Investment, Department of Health and Mr Brian Johns, Chief Executive and Ms Sue O'Connell, Partnerships for Health Like in Australia, much of the primary care estate, the premises from which general practitioners work, is in need of renewal. In the United Kingdom this is being addressed through the Local Improvement Finance Trusts. Set up under the auspices of Partnerships for Health, which is a company 50 1/6 owned by Partnerships UK and 50% owned by the Department of Health, this program enables the leveraging of private finance to assist with infrastructure renewal. In the United Kingdom, a Primary Care Trust, which is a locally based body charged with co-ordinating the delivery of primary care, will apply to set up a local LIFT company. If approved by Partnerships for Health it can then proceed to establish a public/private partnership using 40% public funds and 60% private funds. The United Kingdom experience is that the private sector will be interested in such arrangements even in poorer areas. Clearly, the situation in Australia is quite different given our history of fee for service medicine and consequently private ownership of the much of the primary care estate. In addition, there is appears to be reasonable grounds for scepticism as to whether this financing model will truly offer benefits on the expenditure and risk side. However, it is an interesting development that has only been in train since 2001 and warrants further monitoring. Innovations in after hours care 08.30 am Wednesday 6 April - London Meeting with Mr Paul Jenkins, Director of Service Development, NHS Direct NHS Direct has been a much discussed program in Australia. Established as a health telephone advice service seven years ago it now takes seven million calls a year. It has now moved beyond a call centre to a website and a digital television all aimed at providing health advice. NHS Direct is contracted by local primary care trusts to be the front door to its after hours services. This means for some parts of the England the nurses who answer calls can arrange after hours care whereas in other parts their role is limited to advice only. Under devolution, Wales and Scotland have their own versions of NHS Direct. 187 7 Using well researched clinical protocols to aid nurse decision makers provide health advice and specifically advice as to whether a hospital attendance or after hours access to a GP is required, NHS Direct has only faced one or two medical negligence cases. The debate in Australia about NHS Direct and like services has focussed on whether such services induce additional demand or manage demand by assisting patients to access the appropriate level of care. (Ic waiting overnight for a GP appointment the next day rather than presenting at the local hospital emergency department.) Interestingly a Sheffield University study of NHS Direct has concluded that provided the service is integrated with GP Out of hours care it is demand reducing. Also of interest is the move to the provision of health maintenance advice and chronic disease management advice through the website and digital television. Indeed the website is visited by one million people a month, almost double what goes to the telephone service and the digital television service is attracting 250,000 viewers a month. While debate about the role of telephone triage in after hours care will no doubt continue in Australia, such debate needs to be informed by the United Kingdom experience of NHS Direct. Electorate 08.00 pm Tuesday 5 April - London Dinner with David Buckingham, Agent General for Victoria 10.00 am Friday 14 April - Vancouver Tour of Vancouver Port Authority Offices and Port Facilities hosted by Ms Lori Lindahl, Vice President, Human Resources and Corporate Services and Mr Duncan Wilson, Government Relations Adviser Representing an electorate which is increasingly a major transport and logistics hub given its proximity to the Port of Melbourne, Avalon Airport, the Port of Geelong, the Western Ring Road and connecting freeways, I determined it was important to discuss export opportunities with the Agent General for Victoria and to monitor port developments in Vancouver.

I also had the opportunity to meet with parliamentarians to discuss the effectiveness of the mechanisms in their Parliaments to hold the executive to account.

(i) Confirmation of Purpose: At the invitation of Minister Vaile I participated as a member of the Australian delegation at the Cairns Group XXVII Ministerial Meeting in Cartagena, Colombia. The Cairns Group was established by Labor and is a coalition of 17 agricultural exporting countries determined to reduce agricultural trade barriers. Reflec ting my responsibilities as Shadow Trade Minister, my attendance kept me informed of developments in the WTO Doha Round of trade negotiations and the Cairns Groups approach to the Doha Round I also used the opportunity provided by my visit to meet with Chilean Government trade and economic officials and business representatives in Santiago to discuss developments in the bilateral relationship, together with their views on the WTO Doha Round and APEC (ii) Itineraries and Meetings Monday 28 6, March - Melbourne to Santiaqo \u00e2\u00a2 Depart Melbourne, overnight Santiago Tuesday 29th March - Cartaqena \u00e2\u00a2 Arrive Cartagena Wednesday 30 11 March - Cartaqena \u00e2\u00a2 Attended Calms Group Farm Leaders' Meeting \u00e2\u00a2 Bilateral meeting with Hon Jim Sutton, Minister for Trade Negotiations, New Zealand Canberra Suite Ri 51 Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600 Tel: 0262774911 Fax 0262778547 Melbourne 401 Clayton Tel, 03 95456211 Fax: 03 95456299 Thursday 31 1 - Cartaqena \u00e2\u00a2 Attended Cairns Group Ministerial Meeting \u00e2\u00a2 Bilateral meeting with Mr Mike Johanris, Secretary, United States Department of Agriculture \u00e2\u00a2 Bilateral meeting with the Hon Dr Mukhisa Kituyi, Minister for Trade and Industry, Republic of Kenya \u00e2\u00a2 Bilateral meeting with Mr Martin Buxedas, Ministry of Cattle Ranch, Agriculture, and Fish, Uruguay Friday 1st April - Cartaqena \u00e2\u00a2 Attended Cairns Group Ministerial Meeting \u00e2\u00a2 Bilateral meeting with Ms Mariann Fischer Boel, Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, European Commission \u00e2\u00a2 Bilateral meeting with the Hon Jaime Campos Quiroga, Minister for Agriculture, Chile \u00e2\u00a2 Bilateral meeting with the Hon Roberto Rodrigues, Minister for Agriculture, Livestock and Supply, Brazil Saturday 2 April - Cartaqena to Bogota \u00e2\u00a2 Depart Cartagena, overnight Bogota \u00e2\u00a2 Discussions with Ambassador John Sullivan, Australian Ambassador to Columbia Sunday 3d April - Boqota to Santiaqo Arrive Santiago Monday 45 April - Santiaqo \u00e2\u00a2 Embassy briefing with DFAT, Austrade, DIMIA and DEST officials \u00e2\u00a2 Bilateral meeting with Mr Heman Somerville, President of Confederation of Production and Trade \u00e2\u00a2 Bilateral meeting with Mr Andres Santa Cruz Lopez, President National Agriculture Society \u00e2\u00a2 Bilateral meeting with Mr Carlos Furche, General Director and Mario Matus, Director Bilateral Economic Affairs, DIRECON Tuesday 55 April - Santiaqo \u00e2\u00a2 Visit to Port of Valparaiso \u00e2\u00a2 Attend official Dinner hosted by Ambassador Schick with Australian businesses operating in Chile Wednesday 6 11 April - Santiaqo to Melbourne \u00e2\u00a2 Bilateral meeting with Mr Ricardo Lagos Weber (NB.

I last participated in a Cairns Group meeting in Geneva in December 1993 as Minister for Pnmary Industry and Energy. The Cairns Group then was instrumental in achieving significant progress in trade liberalisation in the Uruguay Round. The meeting in Columbia was both important and timely . The DOHA round discussions are at a cntical stage Ministers meet in Hong Kong in December but for that mee ti ng to be successful it is that important that agreement on modalities be reached by the end of July. The Cairns Group meeng reaffirmed the key issues which must be addressed for a successful outcome to the Round. In particular, the need to make progress in all three areas of export support, domestic support and market access I attended all sessions of the meeting and took the opportunity for a number of bilateral discussions with visiting Ministers and key negotiators. I also attended, at their invitation, the Farm Group Leaders meeting on the day prior to the Cairns Group The Cairns Group agreed on a communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 which is attached There was considerable optimism that an outcome though difficult to achieve was possible for the Hong Kong meeting The importance of the meeting was also underlined by the attendance of the new EU Commissioner for Agriculture Mariann Fischer Boel and the new US Secretary of State for Agriculture Mike Johanns. The interaction between the Cairns Group in the session involving the attendance of the EU and US was very instructive. Clearly the Cairns Group can through a united position exert considerable pressure for a successful outcome on agriculture. Apart from bilateral meetings with both of the above I had the opportunity for bilaterals with a number of other Ministers in attendance Another issue interesting to observe and discuss was the relationship between the Cairns Group and the G20 Group of countries. The latter grouping emerged following the collapse of the DOHA round in Cancun Mexico in 2003. It includes 10 Members of the Cairns Group (not Australia) and importantly, includes China and India. Whilst there is a lot in common, between the two groupings there are some important issues to be resolved, particularty in relation to mantel access Canberra.

I had the opportunity to visit a port and value added aghcultural producing regions around Santiago. (Iv) Conclusion From a portfolio perspective the meeting gave me great insight into the issues surrounding the WTO DOHA round. Whilst the formal sessions reaffirmed the position of the Group, the bilaterals gave a more detailed appreciation of the nuances and the detail of the problem areas still to be resolved They also provided the opportunity to test the issues associated with the emergence of the G20 and its relationship with the Cairns Group. I have been invited by Minister Vaile to attend the Hong Kong Ministerial meefing in December and it will be my intention to use the contacts and the information obtained to follow the progress of the Round and help develop Labor's approach and where possible develop a bipartisan approach to the issues still to be resolved. The other aspect of the discussions was how the countries see the emergence of bilateral trade relationships and their impact on the multilateral round.

I also note that this statement may be tabled in Parliament at your discretion.

Approximately 35,000 Chileans reside in Australia and Chile is Australia's third largest Latin American trading partner. The Ambassador pointed out the opportunities for Australia currently being exploited through the Australia/Chile Bilateral Trade and Investment Commission. The trade opportunities for Australia rest in the export of liquid natural gas, agriculture products, education and training, wine technology, aerospace and defence, processed food for supermarkets, mining and mineral partnerships, pollution control and solar and wind power. There was a discussion about the history of the migration of Chileans to Australia, particularly from the 1970s. I was given very good feedback about the work of my electorate office as it related to immigration matters. In this regard Mr Charles Wan, First Secretary, Immigration, Australian Embassy, Santiago joined the meeting and I reported that my Senior Electorate Officer, Mr Robert Baizola was a registered Migration Agent who had a very detailed and comprehensive knowledge of immigration law. Mr Wann undertook to establish contact with Mr Baizola. Mr Balzola has confirmed to me that he has had contact with Mr Wan and that he has undertaken to provide any assistance or advice to him where appropriate. Page 6 of 53 203 Meeting with Mr Sebastian Iglessia Acting National Director, Senatur Senatur is the Chilean Government's national tourism service. Mr Iglessia reported that, since 1993, Senatur had facilitated 50% public and 50% private promotion of tourism in Chile. Every five years Senatur provides a marketing plan for tourism. Chile markets its natural attractions, for example, National Park (Torres de Paine) and Easter Island (3,000 kilometres to the West of the mainland). Senatur's philosophy is to advertise Santiago as the gateway to Chile (and South America). Senatur also encourages tourists to not only stay in Santiago. Mr Iglessia reported that Chile was winning more places for international conventions than Argentina. Mr Iglessia feels that, with both their natural wildernesses, there are opportunities for Australia and Chile to explore a joint venture. Senatur has a tourism program that is especially designed for different age categories similar to Spain. Broadly, the groups are for the youth, the middle-aged and the elderly. Curiously, I was surprised to learn that most Chileans live within a 200 kilometre radius from Santiago and that they are not inclined to travel long distances. I was particularly impressed with the design of the program for what Senatur describes as \"The Third Age\" (elderly) travellers. The Chilean Government is anxious that senior citizens (over 60 years of age), invalids and pensioners travel in their own country during their retirement years. The system for retirees works by providing a 40% discount (subsidised by the government) on the travelling package. This includes transport, medical insurance, full board and hotel accommodation. An elderly citizen can be accompanied by a carer, where indicated, at the same low price. Page 7 of 53 204 Each year Senatur produces a catalogue showing the locations where these special tourist packages are available. This program stimulates those tourist areas in Chile that need an injection of tourist dollars to assist that particular local economy. Mr Iglessia stated that there was little opportunity for Chileans to travel to Asia but that there was interest in Chileans travelling to Australia, especially with the availability of direct flights with their national airline LAN Chile. \"China is too far away for most Chileans\" remarked Mr Iglessia. Then Government of Chile has a \"great relationship\" with its travel agencies and the private sector, reported Mr Iglessia. He said that they work closely with the LAN Chile airline company which co-shares with QANTAS. Effectively, LAN Chile does the job of Senatur in its promotion of Chile in Australia. A percentage of entry tax to Chile goes to Senatur for tourism promotion. Australians pay US$30 entry tax to Chile while Americans pay US$100. Mr Iglessia was very informative in his organisation's tourism promotion and Australia could learn from some of Chile's schemes for promotion of tourism for seniors within Australia. Page 8 of 53 205 Meeting with Mr Jamie Rovira Soto, Chief, Natural Resources Protection Department, CONAMA and Ms Marcela Main, Acting Chief, International Affairs Department, CONAMA The National Environment Commission (CONAMA) is the Chilean government's agency which has been set up to promote environmentally sustainable development. CONAMA's main task is to co-ordinate all of Chile's agencies and department's in relation to environmental matters. It operates under the control of a Board of 13 Ministers and has offices in thirteen regions in Chile. Ms Main reported that some of the problems facing Chile include air pollution in Santiago and mining in the North of the country which impacts on the natural resources, especially over the past twenty years in which time there has been significant economic growth. There is a national strategy to protect Chile's bio-diversity arising from a number of laws and environmental protection measures. As a consequence Chile, has introduced a National Environment Management System. Ms Main pointed out that CONAMA's national biodiversity strategy is designed to protect the country's national heritage. Its Ministerial Council is the peak environmental policy body. Mr Soto emphasised that the three most important elements of the strategy is to protect eco systems, species and the promotion of sustainable production practices that safeguard bio-diversity. There is considerable air pollution in Santiago due principally to its geographical location at the foot of the Andes mountains and significantly contributed to by motor vehicle emissions, especially the public bus fleet which is very old, poorly maintained and operated on behalf of the Page 9 of 53 206 government by individuals who fiercely compete with each other to make a living. However, I was assured that CONAMA has plans to re-organise the whole bus system by replacing the individual bus owners with bus companies and linking bus routes to subways and other infrastructure. Currently there are 7,000 buses in Santiago and this number will be reduced to 5,500 when the bus companies take over. Further, CONAMA is endeavouring to monitor and improve the quality of the diesel fuel used by the bus operators. This is to be implemented by August 2006. In relation to the overall air pollution levels in Chile I was advised that this is contributed to by the burning of wood (related to poverty), geographical factors and the concentration of Chile's population. I was also advised that the mining sector have been successful in reducing sulphur dioxide levels through pollution plans. Page I0of53 207 Meeting with Mr Jorge Valenzuela, Deputy Director Environment, Environment Branch, Chile Mr Valenzuela's department is concerned, inter alia, with climate change, blo-diversity, protecting endangered species and promoting wetlands. Mr Valenzuela expressed his concern about the effects of global warming and highlighted the fact that, as a developing country, Chile participates in carbon trading through the CDM (Clean Development Mechanism). Chile has a target to reduce greenhouse emissions by 8% by the year 2012. Chile trades with Canada and this allows Canada to meet its commitments. Mr Valenzuela made the point that, although Chile is a developing country and it is not bound by the Kyoto Protocol, it makes its contribution in the reduction of greenhouse gases and feels that other developing countries should do likewise. Mr Valenzuela expressed his concern with the level of air pollution arising from Brazil, China and Indonesia. \"They are big polluters\" stated Mr Valenzuela. Since 1995 Chile has had a national program to help combat CFCs to help repair the damage to the ozone layer. According to Mr Valenzuela, Chile uses better quality fuels and is committed to improving its public transport system. Mr Valenzuela stated that there is not enough investment in gas in Chile due to the fact that the private companies do not see opportunities for profits in gas. As a consequence, Mr Valenzuela is anxious that Chile develops a LNG plant and is interested in Australia's expertise to achieve this. Mr Valenzuela emphasised that Argentina, which has vast amounts of gas, does not have the investment to supply gas to Chile. Mr Valenzuela also reported that Chile is interested in employing solar power in the future. Mr Valenzuela questioned me why Australia had not signed the Kyoto protocol. Page II of 53 208 Meeting with Dr Philip van der Riet, Executive Director, Pacific Hydro Dr van der Riet stated that Pacific Hydro is a leading Australian renewable energy company that is very keen to explore further overseas opportunities. The company was encouraged by Chile because it supports foreign investment and ownership. Dr van der Riet expressed concern that \"Australian investors do not put enough value on Pacific Hydro and it is under threat of being taken over by the Spanish company, Acciona\". Apparently, Acciona is endeavouring to purchase 90% of the company. Pacific Hydra needs access to capital to grow quickly\". Pacific Hydra has acquired the water rights on two rivers close to Santiago that has the potential to develop 500 to 700 megawatts of hydra generation. The melting snow from the Andes has provided an excellent opportunity for the generation of hydro power from rapidly falling water. Pacific Hydra is proud that it has the potential to supply Chile with a very significant amount of electricity and at a time where the cost of energy is rising. Pacific Hydra is very keen to be known as a company that can produce both clean and sustainable electricity generation in Australia and overseas though hydra and wind power. Dr van der Riet sees a very bright future for his company in Chile and that this is very good for Australia. Dr van der Riet pointed out that Chile cannot rely on Argentina to supply Chile with gas and, like Mr Valenzuela, highlighted the opportunity for Australia to sell LNG to Chile. Page I2of53 209 Meeting with Mr de Carvalho, Agroindustria Canavieira (UNICA) and Mr Fernando Riberio Mr Pereira de Carvalho advised that UNICA is the leading representative body in Brazil in relation to Brazil's sugar and ethanol industry. Both he and Mr Riberio have visited Australia last year. Mr Pereira de Carvalho provided an outline of the history of sugar and ethanol in Brazil and proudly advised that Brazil leads the world in the production of sugar and ethanol and that from 1931, following the 1929 oil crisis, Brazil mandated 5% ethanol to gasoline. The employment of ethanol grew again in Brazil in both 1973 and 1979 following another two international oil crises. Mr Pereira de Carvalho said that half of Brazil's sugar crop goes to the production of ethanol and that the sugar cane industry is the largest employer per unit of investment in Brazil. In relation to my questioning of Mr Pereira de Carvalho about strategies for Australia to use more ethanol in favour of gasoline he made the following case. Through necessity Brazil \"took on the oil industry\" to promote the ethanol industry after the oil shocks of the 1970s. In Brazil all motor vehicles run on a minimum of 25% ethanol. Flexible fuel cars were launched two years ago and \"are the same price\" as cars that run on gasoline. Brazil \"exports a lot of cars and every gas station in Brazil have at least one 100% ethanol pump\" said Mr Pereira de Carvalho. Unlike Brazil, \"Australia must work with the oil industry\" simply because the industry is a very powerful opposition. \"Australia must mandate a level of ethanol to be used - like Brazil and some states of the United States of America\" advised Mr Pereira de Carvalho. Page 13 of 53 210 In Mr Pereira de Carvaiho's opinion Australia made a mistake when it mixed 20% ethanol (\"too high and not pure\") with gasoline and this sent a very negative message to motorists. This needs to be addressed and Australia could start by re-educating Australians on the virtues of ethanol and introducing 2% ethanol to be mixed with gasoline followed by 3%,5%, 6% and so on. In relation to pricing, Mr Pereira de Carvalho said that ethanol should be 75% of the price of gasoline so that the motorist is encouraged to use ethanol. Mr Pereira de Carvalho does not accept that, were Australia to use wheat to produce ethanol, this would consume the total wheat crop of Australia. He stated that UNICA was wrongly advised that, when Brazil expanded its production of ethanol in 1975, it would have insufficient food for its population. Further, Mr Pereira de Carvalho stated that his experience of Australia was that the sugar cane industry farmers were largely unwilling to produce ethanol except through molasses (residue). He also rejects the argument that Queensland sugar cane farmers who could produce ethanol would damage the Barrier Reef from run-off. Mr Pereira de Carvalho stated that Australia has lost its competitiveness in the world in sugar cane production and that Brazil is now 30% to 40% ahead of Australia on costs. He added that Australian machinery used for sugar cane growing and harvesting used to be the best in the world twenty years ago, but not now. He says that Australia's argument that the Australian dollar is too strong is \"another spurious argument\". Accordingly, Mr Pereira de Carvalho believes that Australia will get better production figures if it promotes the production of ethanol. Mr Pereira de Carvalho sees an opportunity for Australia to become a partner with Brazil to supply ethanol to Japan. In other words, Brazil Page Mof53 211 could assist Australia to produce ethanol in Australia, for example, in the North of Western Australia and then export it to Japan. He was delighted with the visit to Sao Paulo by the Queensland Premier, Mr Peter Beattie and his personal support for the ethanol industry. Mr Pereira de Carvaiho has also visited Mr Beattie in Queensland. Mr Pereira de Carvalho did not approve of the Australian Government putting a temporary tariff on Brazilian ethanol \"to protect the oil industry\". Further, he is concerned with the level of money given by the oil industry to political parties for the purposed of protecting the oil industry. Not surprisingly, Mr Pereira concluded by enthusiastically recommending that Australia promote the ethanol industry. He is convinced that the oil industry must be part of this promotion if Australia is to succeed in expanding ethanol production and its use in Australia. Page 15 of 53 212 Meeting with Mr Alex Nardiello, Consular Officer, Australian Consulate General and Mr Jose Augusto Lagaz7i, Commercial Advisor, Australian Trade Commission, Sao Paulo Mr Lagazzi reported on the very successful visit to Sao Paulo by Australian sugar cane farmers and the Queensland Premier, Mr Peter Beattie. Mr Lagazzi also reported that General Motors Holden had built a Holden Commodore in Australia that it had been \"tuned to run on 25% ethanol\" and had been sent to Brazil. He stated that this proved that Australia could build cars designed to run on ethanol. In relation to Japan's potential interest in using ethanol Mr Lagazzi made it clear that Japan had insisted to Brazil that it would not buy ethanol from only one supplier, that is, Brazil. Therefore, consistent with the advice given to me from UNICA, Mr Lagazzi also suggested that Australia has an opportunity to become a partner with Brazil in the supply of ethanol to Japan. Mr Lagazzi said that a representative of the Western Australian Government, Mr Henry Steingesser, Executive Director, Trade and Development, Department of Agriculture had also visited Sao Paulo looking for an ethanol export model. Mr Lagazzi made it clear that such a project would need the \"strong support of the Federal Government\". Page I6of53 213 Meeting with His Excellency, Mr Peter Hussin. Australian Ambassador to Argentina and Mr James Bloomfield, First Secretary, Australian Embassy, Buenos Aires Mr Hussin provided and overview of trade between Australia and Argentina that indicated a small balance in favour of Argentina. Mr Hussin pointed out that, over the past two years, there had been an 8% growth in the Argentine economy and that there was a need for more foreign investment. Significantly, the Ambassador highlighted the fact that the President of Argentina was running a budget surplus in order to meet international obligations. The major existing export from Australia is coal. Other exports include crude vegetable materials, specialised machinery, medicaments and electric equipment. Some of the opportunities for Australia continue to be in mining as well as transport and communications together with environmental management, agribusiness, education and tourism. Although Mr Hussin had only been the Ambassador for less than six months he reported enthusiastically on the success of the work of INVAP (a technology-based company) and its construction of the new nuclear reactor for Lucas Heights. Mr Hussin also reported that he had overall diplomatic responsibility for Uruguay but, at the time of our meeting, had not met many of the members of the recently-elected government of Uruguay. Page 17of53 214 Meeting with Mr Santiago Rubio, Post Manager, Australian Trade Commission, Argentina and Uruguay Mr Rubino reported that Australia had been successfully assisting Argentine farmers improve the genetic lines of the herd by sending some farmers to Australia \"to do business in the sheep industry\". Some local farmers have adopted the Australian system of \"Soft Rolling Skin\" (SRS) which has enabled farmers to obtain better quality herd that produces much better wool at higher international prices without impacting on the quality of the meat. Mr Rubinio launched a \"virtual office\" in Mendoza in January of this year to promote wine technology from Australia. Mr Rubino reported that Australia's wine bureaus in New York and London have demonstrated Australia's \"great marketing tools\" in the wine industry. In this industry, Argentina sees Australia not as a threat but as a partner in joint wine ventures. According to Mr Rubino, Australia's Pink Lady apples grow much better in Bariloche, Argentina than they do in Australia. In his view, Australia should grow this variety of apple in Argentina and export to the United Kingdom. The government of Argentina is promoting the region of Patagonia as a clean area of great quality that produces agricultural products free of . diseases. Patagonian lamb is one of the region's best products. Page 18 of 53 215 Meeting with Mr Cesar Fernandez, Member of the Australia-Argentina Chamber of Commerce Mr Fernandez is a former Trade Commissioner and was involved in the setting up of the Uruguay Round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) with Minister John Dawkins. As a member of the Australia-Argentina Chamber of Commerce, Mr Fernandez endeavours to support both the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires and Argentina's Embassy in Canberra. Mr Fernandez pointed out the principal objectives of the Australia-Argentina Chamber of Commerce. He stated that his job was to \"reinforce trade and investment flows between Australia and Argentina\" and to \"encourage economic and non-commercial relations\" and to \"co-operate in spreading information on the image of both Australia and Argentina\". He also emphasised the joint importance of tourism and the mutual benefit to Australia and Argentina of \"promoting reciprocal delegations and visits by students who share a common interest in agricultural, industrial, scientific and technical matters\". Mr Fernandez stated that, although things had improved since the economic crisis of 2002, the government of Argentina was \"not doing enough to bring back investors\". In relation to my questioning of the possible opportunities for Australians to invest in Argentina, Mr Fernandez said that the farming sector needs to purchase more machinery, pasture seeds and investment in animal genetics. In the area of tourism, he saw great opportunities for hotel chains. He stated that, in relation to his wide travel experience throughout Australia, \"Australia is a good example of how families run hotels and motels\". In this regard he sees opportunities for Australians with expertise in the hotel/motel industry to invest in this area with a view to Page 19of53 216 promoting further tourism to areas like Patagonia, the Igua\u00c3\u00a7u Falls and the wine regions of Argentina. Other investment opportunities according to Mr Fernandez could be in ferry passenger services going to the glaciers and the southern lakes of Bariloche. With regard to the mining sector, Mr Fernandez reported that, in the region of San Juan, there were vast natural resources like Chile (\"on the other side of the Andes\") and Australia should be encouraged to invest or mine in this area. Mr Fernandez expressed his sadness that, due to financial difficulties, the national airline of Argentina, Aerolineas Argentina, has lost \"co-share\" status with QANTAS and that Chile's national airline LAN had become the leading airline from South America to Australia. Mr Fernandez strongly suggests that Australian business people looking to invest in Argentina do so through the Chairman of the Australia-Latin American Business Council. Page 20 of 53 217 Lunch (hosted by the Australian Ambassador, Mr Hussin) with Mr Simon Bestani, President, Fundacion Contemporanea, Buenos Aires Fundacion Contemporanea is a non-profit non Government Organisation that is dedicated to the challenges facing Argentina. Its focus is in the following areas: Human Development, Leadership and Strategic Thinking. Essentially, this was a private meeting to discuss Mr Bestani's work in this \"think\u2014tank\" organisation and was also an opportunity for us to share our mutual experiences and involvement in political campaigning. Mr Bestani is considering whether to stand for Federal parliament at the next election in his Mendoza province. Page 21 of 53 218 Meeting with Mr William Duplak, Regional General-Manager, Qantas Airlines, South America Mr Duplak reported that Qantas starting flying from Australia twice a week to Argentina but due to Qantas' shortage of aircraft in 2001 and the devaluation from 1 December 200 l\"the public stopped travelling and this made it unprofitable for Qantas\". Following a \"period of uncertainty in early 2002\" Qantas made a deal to co-share with LAN Chile airlines. In July 2002, two flights were commenced under this arrangement and at the time of my meeting this had increased to four flights per week. It was envisaged that this would increase to 5 flights before 2006. Mr Duplak noted that, although Qantas is intending to purchase ten new A380 airbus aircraft by the end of 2006, none is expected to be used on the Sydney-South America route. Accordingly, Qantas will keep the pressure on LAN to ensure that \"Qantas standards\" are maintained and that this airline provides Australian newspapers and wine on its flights. Mr Duplak was critical that there was \"little activity\" from Tourism Australia in Buenos Aires although \"Qantas is making money with its co-share agreement with LAN\". Mr Duplak sees Australia as a \"huge market\", particularly as a result of the devaluation of the Argentine currency. \u00e2\u00a2 Qantas is also introducing LAN Chile airlines to the South Pacific which further assists LAN, a privately owned airline. Significantly, Mr Duplak made the point that, were Qantas to resume flights to South America in its own right, Qantas would fly from Sydney to Buenos Aires or Sao Paulo and not Santiago. Moreover, Mr Duplak emphasised that Qantas needs a more concerted effort and support from Tourism Australia because it is buying approximately fifty per cent of LAN's seats. Page 22 of 53 219 Meeting with Mr Daniel Pablo Aguilera, Under Secretary for National Tourism and other members of the Secretariat of National Tourism Mr Aguilera said that his Department reports to the President and his prime responsibility was \"promoting Argentina abroad and tourism activities in Argentina\". The Secretariat \"oversees tourist training and tourist activities and incentives together with administration of natural parks\". The Secretariat also co-ordinates the Federal Tourism Council and collects a five per cent tax to promote tourism. There is a National Chamber of Tourism that oversights agents and hotels. Argentina's \"hotel star ratings\" have not been adequately policed to ensure that the ratings are consistent with \"world standards\". However, Argentina is endeavouring to address this with a \"new tourism law\" that \"was approved by Congress\" and will lead to an appropriate policy to reflect \"true and consistent world ratings of its hotels\". Mr Aguilera stated that, although Aerolineas Argentina is a \"near monopoly\", it is a private company and National Tourism has no control over its operations. Apparently, Aerolineas Argentina is going to be \"floated\" and this is intended to raise capital to allow it to renew its fleet. Argentina had a number of principal \"tourist icons\" including the Iguacu Falls, Patagonia, the glaciers and Bariloche. Importantly, Mr Aguilera highlighted the city of Buenos Aires as a major tourist attraction in its own right. In relation to promoting tourism abroad, National Tourism works closely with the various tourism authorities in foreign countries to ensure it promotes Argentina. National Tourism participates in international tourism fairs promoting their national icons and the sport of fly fishing which is \"very popular\" in Argentina. National Tourism also invites international journalists to Argentina and takes them to the most popular attractions so that they will go back to their country of origin and write and broadcast about the attractions to be enjoyed in Argentina. This is Page 23 of 53 220 considered by National Tourism as a relatively cheap method of promoting Argentina to the rest of the world. Mr Aguilera concluded that Tourism in Argentina \"has grown significantly over the past few years with overseas income amounting to approximately $213 (US) or 7.7% of GDP\". Apparently, this is three times the amount of beef exports, 8% ofjob creation and the third most important wealth creation industry in Argentina. Mr Aguilera concluded by reporting that there are some 100 hotels proposed for construction in Argentina and that there are opportunities for Australia to invest and be part of this endeavour. Page 24 of 53 221 Meeting with Ms Rosana Rubinos, Director of the Environment and Mr Federico Peragya, First Secretary and Sub-Director of the Environment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Montevideo, Uruguay Ms Rubinos stated that Uruguay is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol and that the Department of the Environment is \"working hard to prepare Uruguay's framework to address climate change\". Ms Rubinos questioned me why Australia has not signed the Kyoto Protocol. Apparently, some twelve months ago Uruguay \"moved to unleaded petrol\". Further, Uruguay is looking to use more bio-diesel products. Notwithstanding that, \"because of its small amount of industrialisation, Uruguay does not significantly contribute to global warming\". However, Ms Rubinos feels that Uruguay is \"vulnerable\" because of its \"significant dependence the employment of natural resources and its geographical location on the coast of the River Plate\". Apparently, because it is located at the \"downstream of a larger basin\", Uruguay receives adverse impacts from industrial activities up-stream from Brazil and Argentina. As Uruguay relies on hydro-electricity it is experiencing an energy crisis due to the drought. Against this background, Uruguay is involved in a project (involving the World Bank) at Maldonado to extract methane from domestic waste. Ms Robinos is very interested in exploring what Australia is doing in relation to the employment of both solar and wind power. Finally, genetically modified food (GMF) is becoming a significant political issue in Uruguay and Ms Robinos says Uruguay is interested in obtaining information on the technology associated with GMF. Page 25 of 53 Meeting with Mr Diego Paysse, Australian Honorary Consul, Montevideo Mr Paysse explained that he had \"visited Australia in 1996 for three weeks\", undertaking a training course in Canberra and going on to visit Sydney and Adelaide. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Mr Paysse stated that some 30,000 Uruguayans migrated to Australia. Apparently, Australia \"pays 1,800 cheques to the dual citizens who have returned to Uruguay and that most of these are processed through Buenos Aires who distributes same through OCA (an Argentinian courier). Approximately thirty cheques are collected from the Honorary Consulate's office in Montevideo. Mr Paysse has been processing applications in Montevideo for new or renewed passports since 2003. This saves applicants having to travel to Buenos Aires and the average number of interviews conducted by Mr Paysse is two per week. Apparently, the Honorary Consul conducts a smooth operation; however, it would be helpful to him if more commercial information about Australia could be made available to him to distribute to Uruguayan business people interested in investing in Australia. Mr Paysse said that \"Australia sends a lot of information to the Uruguayan government and that I would appreciate getting information sent directly to me\". I undertook to take this up with the Uruguayan Ambassador in Canberra. Mr Paysse said that trade between Australia and Uruguay was \"very small\" but that \"we share common interests\". Although Mr Paysse is \"concerned about the lack of experience of the new Uruguayan government he is impressed that it has a policy to reduce debt levels from 90% of GDP to 60% of GDP over the next five years. Page 26 of 53 223 Meeting with Mr Jorge Caumont, President, Estudio Economico Caumont, Montevideo Mr Caumont reported that he works for some sixty firms advising on financial and economic matters. Due to the most recent economic downturn arising from the financial crisis in Argentina the banks lost 50% of their deposits and GDP declined from $2213 (US) to $1313 (US). This apparently led to a huge ratio of public debt of 90% of GDP. During 2004 exports of beef, soya beans, wheat and oats improved the Uruguayan economy and GDP increased by 12.6% and this year is forecast to be at 6%. This has given a \"confidence boost to Uruguayans\". Mr Caumont said that the new government is a \"left coalition for the first time\" but he, personally, is not worried by this. He says the government \"does not have a common ideological root\". Mr Caumont is concerned with the economy of Argentina and believes that it will have \"big problems\" in the future if it does not address its external debt. Against this background, Uruguay is \"doing its best\" to be less economically dependent on Argentina. While its exports are growing quickly, Uruguay is promoting its tourism industry. The exchange rates for visitors to Uruguay are \"very attractive\" and the occupancy rates of its hotels are very high. Many new 5 star hotels have been built to cater for the influx of tourists. Mr Caumont said that 40% of Uruguay's exports are from \"beef derivatives\". Fifteen years ago farmers were encouraged to grow pine and eucalyptus trees and are now receiving the economic benefits from this. Importantly, Mr Caumont reported that in 2003 Uruguay restructured its debts to ensure that it did not default on its loans and the IMP agreed with the economic program put forward by the new government. Page 27 of 53 224 Meeting with Ms Monica Marenales, Director, Australtours, Montevideo. Mr Marenales stated that \"Australtours is a wholesale operator specialising in tourism in Australia and New Zealand\". Australtours sells tourism packages to travel agencies in Uruguay. Ms Marenales emphasised that \"most of Australtours business is out-bound and not in-bound\". Australtours works closely with Australian tourism companies like Nomads World, Flag Choice Hotels, Qantas Vacations, Dreamtime Resorts and P & 0 Resorts. Ms Marenales also works with the University of New South Wales, Bond University and Griffith University. Australtours has developed special travel packages for people who wish to attend seminars, conventions and cultural and sporting events. Australtours also has special packages for Uruguayan students to travel to Australia to learn English. p Interestingly, Ms Marenales said that Australtours organises for some 400 Uruguayans to go to New Zealand each year and that \"less people go to Australia because New Zealand is better at marketing and provides cheaper services\". Ms Marenales stated that \"Australia does not promote Australia in Uruguay\". She is not pleased that Austrade in Buenos Aires expected her to go to the Australian Festival in Buenos Aires this year and did not offer her with any financial assistance to make this journey. She is also expected to buy advertising in the \"Australian Guide 2005\" and to provide sponsorships from time to time. This is against a background where she claims she is always promoting Australia in Uruguay and she feels Austrade could do more to help her promote Australia. Monica showed me some of her promotion material which was excellent and she is clearly very passionate about Australia. Page 28 of 53 225 Meeting with Mr Carlos Perez del Castillo, Ambassador and Special Advisor to the President for International Trade Negotiations, Montevideo Mr Perez del Castillo lived in Australia from 1963 to 1971, studying economics at the Australian National University and agriculture in Victoria. Following his graduation, he worked for two years as a Field Officer in the Department of Primary Industry. Mr Perez del Castillo discussed the adverse impacts on the Uruguayan economy following the Brazilian devaluation in 1999 and the financial crisis in Argentina in 2002. Tourism and trade were \"hit hard\" with a 65% drop in the number of tourists from Argentina. Mr Perez del Castillo proudly reported that Uruguay always paid its debts and had also been assisted by the world Bank and the IMF. He forecast prospects for economic growth at approximately 5% to 6% this year. At the time of our meeting Mr Perez del Castillo was one of the final candidates for the WTO and very much appreciated the support he received from both Mr Mark Vaile and Simon Crean. Unfortunately for Mr Perez del Castillo he was unsuccessful in this endeavour. Mr Perez del Castillo advised that he was the chief negotiator for Uruguay for the Mercosur (a free trade treaty establishing a common market between Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay). However, he stated that it was \"not working well\" largely due to the number of tariffs. Mr Perez del Castillo is an advocate for \"removing all exemptions\". Mr Perez del Castillo's work with the WTO is targeting the elimination of export subsidies and gaining further market access for Uruguay. Importantly, Mr Perez del Castillo sees the best opportunities for Australia to trade with Uruguay in mining, agriculture, machinery and forestry. He also believes that there are opportunities in the services areas, particularly the development of international hotels in Punta del Este. He also believes that Australian wines are world class and can be promoted in Uruguay. Page 29 of 53 226 Meeting with representatives of Parliamentary Committees on Industry and energy, Public Health, Environment, Foreign Affairs and Defence chaired by Senator Rafael Michelini (centre) together with Senators Susana Dalmas, Monica Xavier, Isaac Alfie, Alberto Couriel, Jorge Garassini and Luis Heber There was a wide ranging discussion about the Mercosur (a free trade treaty establishing a common market between Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay). Similar to the concerns expressed to me by Mr Perez del Castillo, the parliamentary representatives stated that it is not working well for Uruguay. The parliamentary representatives also believe there are \"too many tariffs and exemptions\" and that this is working against the objective of the Mercosur which seeks to achieve \"optimum use of available resources, preserving the environment, improving physical links, coordinating macroeconomic policies and ensuring complementarity between the different sectors of the economy, based on the principles of gradualism, flexibility and balance\". Suffice to say all of the members of the group share a determination to make the Mercosur work because they believe that it is in the interests of all partners and, ultimately it should improve the quality of life for all Uruguayans. Page 30 of 53 227 (A photograph taken inside Palacio Legislativo (Parliament House), Montevideo, Uruguay) Page 31 of 53 228 Meeting with Mr Pablo Bartol, Director of Los Pinos Educational Centre By way of background, Los Pinos is \"a non-educational centre established to provide complementary school education, sports, cultural activities and skill courses to some 235 children aged between five to seventeen years and who live in the poorest areas of Montevideo\". In 2002 Australia provided $2,840 to the Centre so that sports equipment could be purchased to help develop a sports program for \"socially excluded teenage boys\". Mr Bartol expressed his appreciation to me for Australia's assistance to Los Pinos. Mr Bartol said that approximately fifty per cent of children born in Uruguay come from families below the poverty line. Parents must pay a $6US per month contribution (or if they cannot afford this they must do voluntary work at the Centre). Teachers earn $250US per month. The boys must attend a public school from 8-30am to 12 noon and then they attend the Centre to undertake their homework, sports and other supervised activities, such as computer training, English lessons and religious instruction. Importantly, Los Pinos provides a nutritious lunch and afternoon tea before the boys return to their homes. I was very impressed with the atmosphere of the Centre with the obvious happiness of the boys and the enthusiasm of the teachers to help them make a better life for them. In short, Los Pinos provides adolescent boys with a valuable education and at the same time offerings an alternative lifestyle that, otherwise, would probably lead them into drugs and other street crime. Page 32 of 53 229 Picture of me with one of the teachers from Los Pinos and his students Page 33 of 53 230 Photograph of Mr Julio Tabarez, Chief of Protocol for the House of Representatives and Mr Aldo Grana, Foreign Affairs Secretary, House of Representatives following meeting with Senator Silvana Charlone, President of the Foreign Affairs Committee and other committee members from different political parties. The Foreign Affairs Committee gave me a warm welcome and stressed from the outset the need for Australia and Uruguay to \"strengthen trade and tourism between our two countries\". There was a general discussion about the problems associated with the operation of the Mercosur (a free trade treaty establishing a common market between Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay). It was instructive for me to witness the passionate views expressed by each of the members in relation to the future of Uruguay under the new government. Sometimes it got quite heated, particularly when the exchanges were spoken in Spanish. A number of the members of the committee expressed the view that Australia should have an Embassy in Montevideo due to the fact that some thirty thousand Uruguayans are living in Australia, more than any other South American country. Page 34 of 53 231 Meeting with Ms Nora Castro, President, Chamber of Representatives The meeting with Ms Castro took place in her office at the Palacio Legislativo (Parliament House). Our discussion centred again around the common interests of both Australia and Uruguay, particularly as they relate to tourism and agriculture. Ms Castro is disappointed that so many Uruguayans have had to leave her country after gaining a high quality free education. Nevertheless, Ms Castro understood the problems associated with unemployment in Uruguay and the reasons so many Nationals had moved to countries like Australia where the economic circumstances provided better prospects for the livelihood of their families. In relation to trade, Ms Castro spoke of the problems of the working of the Mercosur for a small country like Uruguay. Not surprisingly, Ms Castro emphasised and re-emphasised \"the need to abolish subsidies for genuine free trade\". During our meeting I met the Secretary to the Chamber of Representatives, Dr Jose Montereo who asked to be remembered to the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Mr Ian Harris. Page 35 of 53 232 Meeting with Mr Gabriel Capurro, General Manager, Uruguayan Wool Secretariat Mr Gabriel stated that he was an agronomist and that the Uruguayan Wool Secretariat - the wool producers association - was established in 1968. The Uruguayan Wool Secretariat's objective is to support and promote \"the production, processing and consumption of wool It has a technical staff of 50 people, carries out a wide range of activities which include: applied research on sheep production, technology transfer, sheep breeding programs, shearer training courses, wool market analysis and information, the promotion of Uruguayan wool and cooperation with government, manufacturers and the wool trade\". Mr Capurro advised that \"some 90% (70% combed, 10% textiles and 10% raw) of Uruguay's wool is exported to other countries. Less than 10% is retained for domestic purposes\". Uruguay's most important wool market is China, followed by Italy and Germany. 20% of Uruguay's wool come from merino sheep, according to Mr Capurro. Mr Capurro stated that Uruguay is working closely with New Zealand to eliminate sheep diseases, for example, foot rot. A research project with New Zealand is apparently underway at its research station some 120 kilometres from Montevideo. The nature of this research is associated with worm resistance and pasture management. Mr Capurro said that \"it is not compulsory to dip sheep in Uruguay\" although those farmers who do, do so in autumn and shear the sheep in spring. Page 36 of 53 233 Mr Capurro said that, in 1992, there were 26 million sheep in Uruguay but that this number has been reduced to less than 10 million today. There is thus capacity to increase the number of sheep in Uruguay. Mr Capurro stated that \"the profit will dictate the future of lamb production in Uruguay\". According to Mr Capurro, Australian companies are \"taking an interest\" with one firm involved in a partnership to develop merino Dunis (a particular cross-breed designed to produce both meat and wool). Mr Capurro concluded his advice by stating that Australia \"provides merino and ram semen to Uruguay\". Telephone hook-up with Mr Roberto Bennet, Uruguay XXI The meeting scheduled with Mr Bennet did not take place because the address I had been provided was incorrect. His office had relocated some fourteen months earlier and this was not made know to our Honorary Consul or the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires. Nevertheless, I was able to telephone Mr Bennet and he provided the following information. Uruguay XX1 was established in 1996 and is seen by Mr Bennet as a \"commercial intelligence agency\". \"Uruguay XXI is an investment and export promotion institute that seeks to position Uruguay in the context of the new international economy. The organisation strengthens the country's image globally by promoting Uruguay's strategic geographic importance to develop network and international partners, allowing Uruguay XXI to carry out its objective by utilising existing infrastructure and capacity of national institutions connected with promoting globalisation\". Mr Bennet would like Australia to know that, \"Uruguay is dynamic and modern with excellence in service and production. It is one of the few countries in the world with a 100% digital telecommunications network. Page 37 of 53 234 (Photograph of Palacio Salvo, Montevideo) Electrical power is available to 97.8% of its territory. It has the highest index of Internet uses and personal computers. Uruguay has very high education levels with a 97% literacy rate and the workforce is highly skilled.\" Mr Bennet concluded that \"Montevideo is also a financial centre with a hallmark of legal security that is recognised internationally. Uruguay is integrated as a full member of Mercosur. The country's location is in the heat of this common market and with its excellent communications system puts it in a strategic position to develop business with the region and the world\". Page 38 of 53 235 Meeting with Mr Eduardo de Ia Rosa, Director-General, The National Institute for Agricultural Research (INIA), Dr Pablo President, INIA, Dr Georgget Banchero Hunziker, Scientist, Dr Silvia German, Scientist, Mr Jaime Garcia, Scientist and Mr John Grierson, Head of International Cooperation Unit, INIA INIA was created in 1989 as a public non-government organization with its main mission to \"generate, adapt and provide technology for the benefit of farmers under a demand-driven model\". It is the major organization in Uruguay concerned with agricultural technology. INIA \"contributes to the advancement of the agricultural sector through research and is financed by both public and private sectors (50% each). Farmers pay a 0.4% levy on the first sale of their farm products and a matching amount is provide by the State. Mr de la Rosa reported that \"INIA has signed cooperation agreements with Australian Institutions to develop the following research projects: \u00e2\u00a2 Integration of genomic technologies in forage species - Primary Industries Research Victoria (PIRVic) \u00e2\u00a2 Memorandum of understanding on agricultural and biological sciences and related technologies - (PIRVic) \u00e2\u00a2 Pasture rhizobiology - University of Western Australia \u00e2\u00a2 Alternative technologies to improve ovine reproductive efficiency in Australia and Uruguayan wool breeds - University of Western Australia \u00e2\u00a2 Exchange agreement on selected lines of Lotus corniculatus - University of Western Australia\" Page 39 of 53 236 (Photograph showing cows being milked at INIA) Mr de La Rosa stated that INIA coordinates records of Herefords all over the world to improve production and was to sign an agreement with the Hereford Association involving representatives in Armidale, NSW. INIA has also developed links with Australian and New Zealand seed companies for the purpose of developing a research project for the whole of South America. Apparently, seed companies are showing strong interest in the work of INIA. Mr de la Rosa concluded by stating that one area that Australia could offer assistance to Uruguay is in the area of rust reduction in the wheat and oats crops of Uruguay which is apparently bad. Finally, Mr de la Rosa would like Australia to assist with scholarships for its researchers to study agriculture in Australia. Page 40 of 53 237 Meeting with Mr Chris Clark, President, Uruguay Mineral Exploration Inc Mr Clark advised that his company is a gold produce that focuses on identifying mineral opportunities in Uruguay. Mr Clark left Australia in 1996 because it was \"too hard to do mining business at home\". He raised capital for his company in Canada where \"tax breaks exist for green fields venture\". Initially, the Uruguayan authorities looked at Uruguay Mineral Exploration Company \"suspiciously\" when it started business in December 1996 and was spending about $2 million per year. The company discovered gold ore in 2003 and purchased a mine which is now producing 100,000 ounces of gold a year. This apparently equates with $42 million dollars of exports or 1% of Uruguay's exports. The company operates the only gold mine in Uruguay. It has no difficulties working with the government of Uruguay and he sees his company as \"a real success story\". There are benefits flowing to Australia through his company because he has employed a Western Australian security firm \"Goldfield Security\" to secure the company's mine. Page 41 of 53 238 Meeting with Ms Raquel Rodriguez, Minister, Sub-Director General for International Cooperation From the outset of our discussion, Ms Rodriguez asked me to take back \"a message of confidence to the business people of Australia about the level of community confidence in Uruguay's economy\". Ms Rodriguez would like to \"secure a memorandum of understanding on service and technology with the Federal government and is working with the Australian Ambassador on this project. Ms Rodriguez said that Uruguay has the \"technology to make water potable\" and that it exports this technology \"world-wide\". We had a discussion about the Mercosur (a free trade treaty establishing a common market between Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay) and like the earlier discussions reported on this agreement in this report, Ms Rodriguez wants to \"see subsidies eliminated' in order to promote genuine free trade. Page 42 of 53 239 Meeting with Professor Belela Herrera Sanguinetti, Vice Minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs I had a very short meeting with Professor Sanguinetti who was very interested to learn about Australia. I spoke briefly about the common trade and tourism opportunities that Australia shares with Uruguay. Professor Sanguinetti is a very strong supporter of the Mercosur (a free trade treaty establishing a common market between Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay) and wants to see it working well for Uruguay. She is also a fierce opponent of trade barriers like subsidies and wants to see them \"abolished\". I noted from my meeting that Professor Sanguinetti has a long standing interest in human rights but sadly there was insufficient time to talk to her about this area of her life. Page 43 of 53 240 Informal lunch and meeting with Mr Javier Baez Frugone, Secretariat of Tourism, Maldonado and Mr Martin Laventure, Secretary for Tourism, Municipal Council, Maldonado, Punta Del Este I was originally to have lunch and a meeting with the Mayor of Maldonado, Mr Luis Eduardo Pereira. Unfortunately, he had a accident and suffered a broken ankle the day before our scheduled meeting and he was unable to attend on the day. However, I am grateful that he made arrangements for me to meet Mr Frugone and Mr Laventure. In relation to Mr Pereira I was delighted to learn that he had been elected Mayor of Maldonado and that a big part of his election platform was the good work he did to help set up the sister city relationship between Punta Del Este and Noosa in Queensland. The former Uruguayan Ambassador to Australia, His Excellency, Mr Pablo Sader also played a big role in achieving the sister city relationship. Punta Del Este is beautiful beach holiday resort with a number of characteristics similar to the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. Punta Del Este is one of the largest tourism centres in South America and one can only understand this by visiting the area which I can only describe as pristine. Many international hotels and convention centres are being proposed for Punta Del Este and there are opportunities for Australian investors to invest in these developments. Page 44 of 53 241 Meeting with Mr Carlos Serale di Cerisano, Director of International Security and Nuclear and Space Affairs, Ministry of External Affairs, Mr Pedro Delgado, Co- ordinatior of Strategic Projects, Ministry of External Affairs, Mr Hector E Otherguy, General Manager and Chief Executive Officer, INVAP, Buenos Aires. Mr Horacio A Osuna, Vice-Chairman of the Board, INVAP and Mr Juan Jose Gil Gerbino, Manager of Nuclear Projects, INVAP INVAP was established in 1976 in Bariloche, Argentina where it is still based. Mr Serale di Cerisano advised me that \"INVAP develops advanced technology products in various fields of application and especially in nuclear and space technology. INVAP builds nuclear research reactors, radioisotope production plants and other nuclear facilities. INVAP is very proud that it is building a new nuclear research reactor for Australia at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO), Lucas Heights. The design of the reactor is \"to produce radioisotopes and other scientific purposes\". Apparently the new nuclear reactor for Lucas Heights will increase production by four or five times that of the old reactor. Accordingly, ANSTO is expected to increase its export revenue from $30 million to $150 million. INVAP management involved in the new nuclear reactor for ANSTO were very impressed with their dealings with the Chief Executive Office of ANSTO, Professor Helen Garnett. The former Ambassador to Australia, Mr Nestor Stancanelli played a very important role in INVAP winning the bid for the project. INVAP gave me a short history of the success of its nuclear power stations in Argentina and reported on the nuclear bilateral treaty between Australia and Argentina. Importantly, a great deal of the discussion focussed on INVAP's safety record associated with constructing nuclear reactors. Page 45 of 53 242 Meeting with Australia! Argentina Parliamentary Friendship Group: Dr Sonia M Escudero, Mr Diego F. M. Limeres, Dr Marcelo Guinle, Dr Miguel Angel Pichetto, Professor Roxana Latorre, Dr Luis Molinari Romero, Dr Luis Falco, Mr Jorge Arguello and Mr Celso Alejandron Jaque I was given a very warm welcome by the members of the Australia! Argentina parliamentary friendship group. The group asked many questions about Australia and indicated that some would be visiting Australia on an official parliamentary delegation later in the year. The members were pleased with the fact that Australia was purchasing a new nuclear reactor from INVAP and expressed the wish that the quality of the reactor and the benefits to Australia from it will bring our two countries closer together. After our meeting Dr Escudero hosted an informal lunch which was followed by a tour of the national parliament of Argentina. Page 46 of 53 243 Tour of Ecological Reserve Constanera Sur, Buenos Aires and meeting with Dr Alberto Oliveira Rial, Reserve Coordinator The Costanera Dur Ecological Reserve is an 870 acre area of green space, possessing some unique features and located adjacent to the River Plate in the southern corner of the city of Buenos Aires. I was taken on a tour of the reserve and then given a presentation by Dr Rial. In essence the reserve provides an immediate ideal environment for the more than 10 million residents and tourists staying in Buenos Aires. They can come to the reserve and \"get very close\" to nature and the wildlife that lives in the reserve. The reserve represents some 25% per cent of the total public recreation area in Buenos Aires and approximately 250 species of birds, 9 varieties of amphibians, 23 types of reptiles, 10 different mammals, 50 types of butterflies and some 245 different kinds of flowers. The reserve is a very natural and beautiful environmental setting which is managed by the City of Buenos Aires Environment Department. Every year many school and university students tour the reserve in order to educate them in the benefits of promoting natural environmental settings, particularly close to large urban areas. Page 47 of 53 244 4 Meeting with the Rural Society of Argentina: Dr Luciano Miguens, President, Mr Esteban A Takes, director, Mr Ernesto Ambrose, Senior Economist and Mr Roccatagliata The Rural Society of Argentina was founded in on 10 July 1866 and its members are all farmers. The original purpose for setting up the society was \"to improve the tilling skills of the farmers; establishing relationships with the most important markets and learning about their needs; creating a library for farmers; publishing a fanning journal; stimulating scientists to do research and publish their findings; organise trade shows for livestock, poultry and farm products\". Dr Miguens stated that the Society today is still faithful to its \"original mission objectives\". In today's terms, Dr Miguens reported that the Society can provide \"pedigree breeds for every breed in the country, advisory services, veterinary services, library services and a DNA Laboratory\". The society has \"showgrounds in the district of Palermo (11 hectacres) with 2,000 head of sheep, horses, pigs and poultry\". There is a \"training institute in Belgrano. Each year the society sponsors an annual show of industrial machinery and feed. The Society has a close relationship with Australia through the National Farmers' Federation. In this regard, Peter Corish visited Buenos Aires following the Cairns Group meeting in Colombia earlier this year. The Society is a private non profit organisation that provides real solutions to sectorial problems by \"putting forward proposals and not protests\" to farming problems. It is the most important organisation that assists fanners in South America. Dr Miguens made a final point that \"the fanning sector is not properly represented in the parliamentary Congress\". Page 48 of 53 245 Meeting with Mr Carlos Conrado llelbling, Vice-President, CARl (Argentine Council for Foreign Relations) and members of the CARL group Dr Helbling stated that \"The Argentine Council for International Relations (CARL) is a private, non-profit, academic institution. It was founded in 1978 and aims to promote the study and debate on world issues from a national perspective. It also analyses the political, economic, cultural and social aspects of international relations and offers a platform for both foreign representatives. Can's ultimate goal is to consolidate peace and development through closer links and a greater reciprocal understanding among different peoples\". There was little opportunity for me to obtain recent detailed activities of CARl because the group were more interested in finding about the current political environment of Australia and \"interrogating\" me about Australia's involvement in the Iraq war; why Australia .had signed a Free Trade Agreement with the United States of America and why Australia was not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol. I explained that, as a member of the Federal opposition, I could not speak for the government; however, I took the opportunity to explain the Australian Labor Party's policies in these areas. Page 49 of 53 246 Meeting with Ms Luciana Diaz Frers, Coordinator for Fiscal Policy, Centre of Implementation of Public Policy for Equity and Growth (CIPPEC) and Mr Daniel Maceira, Health Care Policy Area, CIPPEC CIPPEC is a non-government organization that sees itself as a \"watch dog of government\" and \"think tank\" for the purposes of improving public and fiscal policy in Argentina. In relation to fiscal policy CIPECC believes that the government is \"seriously addressing\" government debt but that this will require constant supervision. There is a \"need for more investment\" and \"wages have been frozen in the public sector\". CIPECC considers that it has an important role in monitoring and contributing to the improvement to the country's health system. There are problems associated with administering the health system throughout the twenty four provinces in Argentina and it is thought to be extremely fragmented. Argentina has more than three hundred social insurance plans and the health funds are not good at articulating the services they provide. Moreover, there are large disparities in the quality of services between funds. CIPPEC provides technical assistance to those working in health management, particularly to those in jobs responsible for budget allocations and priority settings. CIPPEC also assists them in their management training and also training them to identify organizational and process bottlenecks throughout the health system. There are mixed patterns in the levels of health expenditures. Poor families use a higher percentage of their income on pharmaceuticals compared with families who are well off and can afford private health insurance to cover the costs of pharmaceuticals. CIPECC was very interested in my explanation of Australia's Medicare system. Page 50 of 53 247 Outcome/Findings: \u00e2\u00a2 Chile operates a tourism program for \"the Third Age\" (Seniors and Invalids) which provides 40% discounts (subsidised by the Government) on travelling packages in tourist areas in Chile that need an economic boost. Australia could consider adopting elements of this package. \u00e2\u00a2 Chile is interested in developing an LNG plant with assistance from Australia (joint venture) \u00e2\u00a2 Pacific Hydro is a successful Australian renewable energy company which could benefit from any government assistance/advice to help it raise capital quickly and prevent its takeover by a foreign company (Acciona) \u00e2\u00a2 Brazil is building a stronger economy on the back of ethanol. Australia needs to do even more to implement a renewable fuels initiative and cut greenhouse gas emissions from the passenger transport sector. It is suggested that a requirement be imposed on those who import or refine petroleum products for end sale to passenger motor vehicles to incorporate a minimum percentage of bio-fuels. In time I believe that the Government should mandate the blending of 10% bio-fuels, particularly ethanol. \u00e2\u00a2 Australia should also investigate the feasibility ofajoint venture with Brazil to produce ethanol in Australia for both Australia and to export to Asia, particularly Japan. \u00e2\u00a2 Australia has the capability to manufacture motor vehicles designed to run on 25% ethanol. The government should encourage and provide incentives to the car manufacturing industry to manufacture cars capable of running on this amount of ethanol. \u00e2\u00a2 Australian \"Pink Lady\" apples grow better in Argentina. Australian apple growers might wish to undertake a joint venture with Argentina to grow these apples and export them to the United Kingdom. \u00e2\u00a2 There are opportunities in Argentina for investment in hotel chains, tourism and mining. Page 51 of 53 249 \u00e2\u00a2 Tourism Australia should review its level of activity in the promotion of Australia in Buenos Aires. \u00e2\u00a2 Ms Rosana Rubinos, Director of the Environment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Montevideo, Uruguay is interested to obtain any information about Australia's activities in solar and wind power and genetically modified food (GMF). \u00e2\u00a2 The Honorary Australian Consul for Uruguay, Mr Diego Paysse seeks more commercial investment information about Australia for the purposes of distributing to Uruguayan business people. \u00e2\u00a2 Austrade in Argentina might like to contact Ms Monica Marenales, Director, Australtours and see what further practical assistance or advice it can offer her in the promotion of tours to Australia. \u00e2\u00a2 There are opportunities for Australian investment in Uruguay in the mining, agriculture, machinery, forestry, hotel and tourist sectors. Australia can also promote its wines in Uruguay. \u00e2\u00a2 A further small financial grant from Australia to Los Pinos would be sincerely appreciated. \u00e2\u00a2 Australia can provide assistance/advice to help Uruguay in the reduction of rust in Uruguay's wheat and oats crops. \u00e2\u00a2 Mr Eduardo de la Rosa, Director-General, The National Institute for Agricultural Research (INIA) would like Australia to consider offering scholarships for its scientific researchers to study agriculture in Australia. Page 52 of 53 249 Conclusion: It was a great personal experience for me to be able to visit four countries in South America and meet such a diverse range of parliamentarians, government and departmental officials, educators, scientists, environmentalists and business people. The program was very busy with some 35 meetings and the language barrier at times made it difficult to fully appreciate some of the information being provided. Nevertheless, I believe that I have a better understanding and appreciation of South America and that this will help me in my parliamentary duties within my electorate and also in my contact with the Latin American diplomats who regularly seek assistance and advice from me. In concluding, South Americans are very warm and hospitable and have a very genuine interest in Australia, particularly as we share many common interests in primary industry, science and tourism. Finally, I wish to thank all of those members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who helped make my visit such a memorable experience.

I will be arriving in Manila on Thursday, 31 March 2005. (b) Itinerary: My itinerary is summarised as follows: Thursday, 31 March 06:25am depart Adelaide QF660/019 via Brisbane and arrive Manila 6:45pm Thursday, 7 April 8:40pm depart Manila QF020 arrive Sydney 06:40aon (Friday, 8 April) Friday, 8 April 08:20am depart Sydney arrive Adelaide 10:00am (ii) Kay meetings and outcomes/findings: In addition to attending the Board meeting of the Global Parliamentary Foundation fbr Democracy, meetings of the 12+ and Asia-Pacific I.P.U. geo-political groups, the 12+ Dinner and the official Opening Ceremony of the I.P.U. Assembly and a briefing by the Australian Embassy in Manila between Friday 1 April and Sunday 3 April 2005, as provided for by the Senate, I attended the following additional meetings: 256 a second Global Foundation Board meeting on Monday, 4 April 2005 convened and chaired a meeting of parliamentarians attending the I.P.U. Assembly representing political parties affiliated with the International Democratic Union on Monday 4 April 2005 undertook a tour of inspection of a coconut plantation on Tuesday, 5 April 2005 attended the meeting of the Bureau (Executive) of the Second Standing Committee of the I.P.U. covering Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade, of which I remain a member, on Wednesday, 6 April 2005 - a meeting of the Australian delegation with Philippines' Senate President Drillon on Wednesday, 6 April 2005 - further meetings of the 12 - goo-political group on Monday 4 April, Wednesday 6 April and Thursday, 7 April 2005 - segments of the I.P.U. Assembly on Monday 4, Wednesday 6 and Thursday 7 April 2005 - several meetings of the Australian delegation to the I.P.U. As the previous Permanent Representative and Leader of the Australian Delegation to the I.P.U., 2002 to 2004, I was able to offer information and advice, as requested at the various meetings, to the new delegation, for which Manila was their first exposure to the I.P.U. This included the Assembly, Committee and goo-political groups' meetings, as well as at the Australian delegation's daily get together and debriefing. The proposed emergency agenda item for the I.P.U. Assembly on the tsunami, together with appointments to its drafting committee and the drafting committee for the Standing Committees were the main issues discussed at the gee-political groups In the context of concern at the Asia-Pacific geo-political group regarding the Chairman's handling of procedure and progress through the agenda, with the support of several countries' delegations I assumed the role of \"advisor\" to the Chairman on procedural matters. This enabled the meeting to continue and conclude its business efficiently. My role in this was favourably recognised by many delegates at the conclusion of the meeting. At the 12- Group, a significant issue emerged regarding the election of the next President of the I.P.U. due to take place at the Geneva Assembly in October 2005. Two candidates, Belgian M.P. and current 12~ Chairman Geert Versnick and Speaker of the Italian Parliament, Pier Casini, had announced their intention to seek the presidency. There was general recognition that it was the 12+ Group's turn to have the President from their ranirs. Hence, at the Geneva I.P.U. in September 2004, the 12+ Group had decided to vote in Manila to determine its preferred candidate. This was opposed by Mr Casini and the Italian delegation. During the Manila conference, although Mr Casini intended to attend and present his case, along with Mr Veersnick, to the 12\u00b1 Group, it was announced by the Italian delegation that, irrespective of the result of the ballot within the 12+ Group, Mr Casini would put his candidacy to the full I.P.U. Council meeting in Geneva in October 2005. In the event, the death of Pope John Paul 11 prevented Mr Casini from attending the Manila I.P.U. Hence, there was considerable debate in the 12+ Group meetings as to whether a ballot should take place within the Group, especially given Mr Casini's absence. The meeting on Tuesday 5 April 2005 voted to proceed with the ballot between the two candidates at its Wednesday 6 April meeting. Australia's two votes were against. At Wednesday's meeting, Australia cast one vote for Mr Veranick and one for Mr Casini. The detail of matters discussed at the Global Foundation Board meetings remain confidential to the Board. However, in general, decisions were made on matters relating to the registration of the Foundation in Geneva and initial fund-raising activities to establish the corpus of the Foundation. The Bureau of the Second Standing Committee discussed and decided on the subject to be debated by the Second Committee at the I.P.U. to be held in Kenya, May 2006, Sustainable development and the environment were decided upon. I was successful in having a reference to the Kyoto Agreement removed from the subject matter. The General Debate in the I.P.U. Assembly ranged across many issues, despite the intent of the debate to focus on the impact of government policies on women. The tour of the coconut plantation included a demonstration of the several different methods of coconut harvesting. Of novel interest was lunch served at the plantation's visitors' restaurant located in the middle of a mild-flowing river, below a small hydro-electric power station. Guests sat at tables with shoes removed and feet in the flowing water. (iii) Conclusion: Attending meetings and functions of the I.P.U. Assembly, in addition to the Global Foundation Board, assisted the maintenance by Australia of the high reputation our delegation had worked hard to build during the past three years, following a period during which it was less satisfactory. This was particularly evident from our meeting with Senator Dillon. It served to reinforce, at a parliamentary level, the good work being done by Ministers at an executive level to enhance Australia's international standing. I note that in accordance with Clause 9.4 of the Remuneration Tribunal Determination No.26 of 1998 a copy of this statement may be obtained from you upon request by any Member or Senator. I also note that this statement may be tabled in Parliament at your discretion. Yours sincerely Grant Chapman Liberal Senator fQr South Australia 3 May 2005 258 SENATOR CHRIS EVANS Senator Chris Evans Overseas Study Trip 1 April -27 April 2005 England/France/Turkey 260 During April 2005 1 undertook a study trip that included appointments in England, France and Turkey. Appointments in each country were largely arranged by the relevant Australian Embassy and I'm indebted to them for their first class assistance. The primary focus of the trip was to acquaint myself with British and European developments in social policy, with particular reference to my Shadow Ministerial responsibilities for Social Security. A secondary focus was on issues of international relations which reflected both my personal interests and formal responsibilities in the Senate. The visit to Turkey was in order to attend the ANZAC Ceremonies commemorating the 90th Anniversary of the Gallipolli landings. I gratefully acknowledge the tremendous assistance of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Australian Embassy in Turkey. The attached itinerary details the appointments that I was able to access during the trip. The appointments in France were attended by Australian Embassy or OECD Delegation staff and were the subject of a cable from the Australian Embassy in Paris. England A major focus of my visit was the social policy initiatives of the Blair Labour Government and in particular their welfare to work agenda. I met with senior Department Representatives from the Department of Work and Pensions, Treasury, Jobcentre Plus and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. During an intensive program of meetings I was able to develop a keen understanding of the policy challenges and experiences in reforming welfare policy in Britain. The key philosophical shift driven by the Government to have Departments regard their key responsibility as assisting people to find work was most apparent. That philosophical shift has been adopted and reflected in the priorities and mind set of all Government Departments. It, I It was also very apparent that the Governments approach was to provide real tangible incentives to assist people with transition from welfare to work. The assistance of Ms Caroline Young from the Department of Work and Pensions, Joint International Unit was greatly appreciated. These Departmental discussions were complemented by meetings with members of the Government with responsibilities and interests in the social policy field. The calling of the British Election during the week did limit my access to senior Government Ministers however a number of members of the Government honoured appointments despite the difficult timing. Other appointments concentrated on British foreign policy (with particular regard to Iraq), House of Lords Reform and European Union developments. I was pleased to meet with our new High Commissioner to Britain and former Senate colleague, Richard Alston who was generous with his time. The visit also allowed me the opportunity to pursue issues with a diverse range of contacts including Mr Leigh Clifford, CEO of Rio Tinto, Bob Fisher, Agent General for Western Australia and officials from Amnesty International. The visit was very successful due largely to the work of the Embassy officials, despite quite difficult circumstances. My particular thanks to Ms Liz Lindores, Manager Visits and Client Services, Australian High Commission. France During my visit to Paris I had an extensive range of meetings with French Government officials and foreign policy commentators. The programme was arranged by the Australian Embassy in Paris and the Australian OECD delegation. Australian officials attended all meetings with me and the Embassy with my agreement provided a cable summarizing key issues to DFAT. The visit primarily focused on the progress of welfare reform within France and the European Union. Many of the challenges facing French policy makers were being drawn into sharp focus as part of the French referendum on the new European Union constitution. This 2 262 was a key concern of French legislators as the referendum debate was being heavily influenced by public concern over perceived EU agendas on issues such as pension reform. The series of meetings with OECD officials and the discussion of OECD comparative country studies were particularly useful in putting the French debate into a broader context and in referencing to the Australian public policy issues. The benefit of the Australian superannuation reforms of the 1980s is sharply highlighted by the British and French experience. The secondary focus of the French meetings was on foreign and economic policy issues. The Embassy arranged a number of senior Government officials to meet with me and to discuss foreign policy and French perspectives. This included the Ambassador hosting a lunch at the Embassy with key French Foreign Affairs officials. While my interests were concentrated on Iraq, the Middle East and EU developments, French officials were anxious to engage on a range of matters. Foremost among these were China's and Frances effort to lift the EU arms embargo on China, the perceived failure of the US to treat seriously European thinking on foreign policy and Australian attitudes to Frances Pacific territories. It was apparent to me and was remarked upon by our Ambassador Penny Wensley, that there was a real desire on behalf of French officials to more seriously engage with Australian ministers, parliamentarians and officials. France remains committed to a leadership role in pursuing its long term foreign policy and strategic interests in the Pacific and Asia. Turkey The purpose of my visit to Turkey was to attend ANZAC Day Ceremonies of the 90th Anniversary of the Gallipoli landings. The Australian Embassy in Ankara arranged the programme for my visit in conjunction with DVA as part of the official delegation. The Anzac Day Ceremonies were the highlight of the visit and a most memorable experience. The Embassy, Department of Veterans' Affairs and Department of Defence officials responsible for the event are to be congratulated on an exemplary effort in difficult circumstances. The support of Ms Robyn Brick and Ms Fatum Kadah was extraordinary and greatly appreciated. 3 It is not my intention in this report to canvass political issues surrounding the roadworks and other arrangements to support the ceremonies except to make these remarks: Firstly, the extraordinary hospitality and cooperation of the Turkish people in facilitating our recognition of our national day on their territory is quite remarkable. I can think of no other former enemy country who allows such respect and commemoration to occur on their territory. We cannot acknowledge enough the courtesy and welcome the Turkish Government and people extended to Australians. Secondly, the facilities for the thousands of Australians who make the pilgrimage to ANZAC Day at Gallipoli still need to be further improved. The experience for those travelling privately needs to improve if their participation is to be encouraged, as it should. Thirdly, the Anzac Cove area was greatly changed as a result of the roadworks compared to my previous visit some 15 years ago. There is strong reason for Australians to be concerned that the integrity of the site is maintained and Turkish authorities assisted in this regard. Conclusion The study programme was an extremely positive learning experience. The contact with senior policy makers and officials has broadened my understanding of the social, economic and foreign policy issues that confront Australia. The knowledge, perspectives and contacts gained will inform my work in the Parliament and my contribution to the development of Labor Party policy in the future.

These discussions provided the following information. Stephen Harris outlined the decision making structure regarding PPPs in Britain and pointed out that every successful PPP contract has been centrally controlled in the British equivalent of the Ministry of Finance. He advised that a world market in PPPs is slowly emerging. Whereas previously British specialists had dominated the market, there are now cheaper professional competitors emerging in a number of countries. On his assessment there are now eighty one countries where PPPs are under way. The European Union, France and Germany were strongly opposed to PPPs up to approximately eighteen months ago but are now actively promoting them. In countries with federal structures, as in Australia, most of the action with respect to PPPs has been at the state level. Generally speaking, as in Australia, the federal involvement with PPPs is largely restricted to defence and major highways. At last count, 44 hospitals have been constructed under PPPs in Britain. Some of these hospitals have included the provision of major medical equipment as part of the private contractors responsibilities, and others have not. A very substantial number of schools have been constructed under PPPs, where the provision of building, long term maintenance, catering and security has been a standard form mainstay of these contracts. There have been successes and failures, with outstanding successes occurring in Glasgow where there are incentive payments built in to the contract for the private provider which are based on the educational outcomes for children at the schools, and also other indicators such as levels of vandalism, graffiti. Some private providers for schools have provided well equipped gyms which are used as private sports clubs at night time and weekends. Every major ministry in the British government now has a PPP unit which works with the Treasury in overseeing PPP contracts, and also with Partnerships UK, a specialist unit established for this purpose. There is also an organisation called PPPP, (Public Private Partnerships Program) which is jointly funded by local authorities and the British government, and functions as a help desk to assist local authorities pursuing PPPs. Public sector comparators are now widely used as a means of determining whether a PPP is appropriate for a particular infrastructure development. Experience suggests that PPPs are inappropriate for rail transport because 7 276 the level of subsidisation being required to make passenger rail economic is simply to high, however experience in many other areas has been very positive, although there have been one or two companies which have tailed, attracting substantial publicity. The crucial question is always the detail of the contract, what risks are transferred to the private sector, and what mechanisms are provided for enforcement of the contracts. The National Audit Office has undertaken approximately 50 reports regarding individual public private partnerships and most of its conclusions have been reasonably positive, although it had been critical of particular arrangements. There are some signs of a securities market emerging specifically with respect to long term PPP investments, broadly equivalent to the bond market, but this is very much a recent national development. John Biggs, a Labour member of the London Assembly, outlined the range of responsibilities which are undertaken by the Assembly, which primarily relates to local transport, policing, fire and planning issues. The Assembly is responsible for a large amount of investment in infrastructure, particularly transport, and has invested substantial amounts in improving buses with new vehicles, priority lanes and co-ordinated traffic lights. This has led to very substantial increases in patronage and improvement in performance. The Assembly is responsible for running the London Underground, but has only received this responsibility after a long term maintenance PPP was negotiated by the UK Government. The London Assembly was opposed to this PPP and has run a strong campaign against it, but has had to administer it. The Assembly effectively oversees the authority which is responsible for the Underground, Transport for London, which pays a monthly fee to the two private providers which effectively run the underground under a thirty year public private partnership. The contracts for this PPP are highly complex and involve a range of services benchmarks which are linked to the payment. The Assembly believes something in the order of \u00a31 billion a year is needed In investment in the underground, and is very conscious of deficiencies in the infrastructure. Although the Assembly remains unhappy with the nature of the PPPs, it believes improvements are occurring and that it is making the best of the situation that has been imposed upon it. David Finlay of the National Audit Office outlined in some detail the experience of the National Audit Office with respect to PPPs in Britain. Over approximately ten years, around 600 PPP contracts have been entered into, of which 400 are currently operational, with services actually being delivered. The Audit Office has conducted a substantial number of reports both on specific projects, and on generic themes spreading across PPPs, such as construction, refinancing, and the managing of public-private relationships. The National Audit Office believes that the record of service delivery under PPPs is very good, and a substantial improvement on previous service delivery and pure public sector arrangements. Under the typical PPPs private operators do not get paid until the services they are providing are operating at satisfactory level standard as specified in the contract. Typically contracts have a variety of future variation control clauses to deal with a range of variables that are likely to have an effect over the course of a long term contract. 8 Although the private sector has to pay a higher cost of capital than the public sector, in theory this is outweighed in PPPs due to benefits such as the transfer of risk to the private sector which is previously unidentified in public sector accounts. The National Audit Office believes that intense scrutiny by private banks and other investors which is necessarily involved in the funding of PPPs tends to produce better quality projects that are more rigorously developed and policed. Because private investors are under intense pressure to produce returns, the National Audit Office believes that this produces a much more intense level of scrutiny before funding is committed. The National Audit Office had substantial reservations about the public sector comparators that are used in determining whether or not a PPP is appropriate for a particular project. The Audit Office believes that is relatively easy for proponents to manipulate the outcomes of these equations, by tinkering with the elements within the equations, and rigging assumptions. However the National Audit Office believes that the overall outcomes of PPPs has not been demonstrably more expensive than direct provisions of government would have been. Mr Finlay advised that the government is currently trialling hybrid PPPs with hospital projects, where finance is actually provided by the government, which borrows the money and then on lends that money to the private providers, and their risk is then underwritten by bank investors. The Audit Office is yet to form a view on the effect of this particular approach, noting that the additional cost of the underwriting will partly offset the lower cost of capital for the government borrowing, and also drawing attention to the degree of the conflict of interest this creates in the government. On the one hand, the government has an interest in vigorously enforcing the contract, on the other hand it may not wish to do so if this jeopardises repayments of the loan that it has provided to the private provider. The National Audit Office has conducted a substantial study of PPPs prisons, and has concluded on average they are better than publicly developed prisons. Although it found there was a spread of outcomes positive and negative across both public and private sectors, on average the private sector result is better. These typically involve all of the staff in the prison being employed by the private operator, but the prison governor remaining a public sector employee. The National Audit Office is currently undertaking a similar study across the forty four PPPs hospitals and other hospitals built by the public sector in order to develop a similar analysis. The National Audit Office is not involved with auditing PPP school projects, because there is a separate Audit Commission which audits local authorities, that are directly involved in delivering education services. Of the approximately 600 PPPs in Britain, only a tiny handful have encountered major problems. For example a contract to provide a major government science Labouratory has been terminated, leading to very large losses to the private companies involved. Jarvis, a company with a substantial number of PPPs schools contracts, has recently encountered major financial problems leading it to be unable to pay building sub-contractors. 9 Mr Finlay pointed out that there has been a windfall gain to the private providers in many earlier PPP contracts, because lending margins from banks were originally unduly high, with a generic PPP risk factor included which has since been abandoned. Therefore the assumed cost of borrowing in the initial contract has been over-generous, leading to substantial windfall profits for private shareholders as their cost of capital has become substantially lower as a result of PPPs becoming much more widely established. After negotiations between the major players in the PPP sector and the government, it has been agreed that a standard arrangement will be that in new contracts gains on refinancing will be shared equally between the government body and the developer, and that for pre-existing contracts where such gains have eventuated, the private providers will voluntarily give thirty percent of the gain to the government body. Michael Gerrard, Deputy Director, and Edward Farquharson, Assistant Director from Partnerships UK outlined the structure and role of the organisation. Partnerships UK is a company that is effectively an arm of the UK Treasury employing forty five people which provides central support, advice and oversight for public private partnerships. The company is forty nine percent owned by the government and fifty one percent owned by the major private operators, such as banks, and insurance companies. It does exclusively government related work and does not pay a dividend. It has both a board of directors and a government controlled supervisory board which sits above the board of directors. It functions as a private company, with employees not covered by the public service pay and conditions, but is effectively an arm of government. There is a separate unit in the Treasury developing PPP policy, which employs twelve people. The primary objective of Partnerships UK is to aggregate the knowledge and expertise in the public sector regarding PPPs, and maximise the bargaining and purchasing power of government bodies. It produces standard form contracts and at any one time is typically advising public bodies on 200 PPPs. It is usually only directly involved in a major way in around twenty big PPPs, providing help desk support and standard contract clauses and other assistance for those involved in smaller projects, or repeat projects. Mr Gerrard and Mr Farquharson provided advice on the development of Partnership for Health under which forty five new health facilities are being developed jointly by the Ministry of Health and Partnerships UK. Similar developments are occurring with the Partnerships for Schools program which involves and investment of approximately \u00a310 billion over ten years to rebuild secondary schools in Britain, with private providers providing long term cleaning, security maintenance, and information technology requirements. Mr Gerrard and Mr Farquharson cited an example of how traditional public sector contracts can involve risks and losses not properly accounted for, a \u00a325 million leisure centre undertaken by the Harringay Local Authority, which upon completion was discovered to be too costly for the local authority to maintain, clean and provide security. As a result of the local authontys inability to finance the ongoing cost of operations of the centre, because of failure of supervision of construction. The centre is now closed. The investment of \u00a325 million has largely been wasted. 10 279 The availability of adequate contract management skills in the public sector has been a crucial problem in implementing the PPPs in Britain. This has become a significant issue, because without this capacity, the ability for the public sector to get value for money is jeopardised. Mr Gerrard and Mr Farquharson noted that the crucial difference between a PPP and ordinary outsourcing, is that PPPs require private providers to put capital at risk, where as outsourcing essential only involves profit and loss risk. Mr Gerrard and Mr Farquharson advised that under the PPPs in the Health sector, cleaning, security and portering in the hospitals have been transferred to the private providers. Under a government deal with Unison, the major public sector trade union, workers in these hospitals have effectively been seconded to the private provider, but retained their public sector terms and conditions of employment Similar complicated arrangements have been created in the London Underground, where operational staff remain public sector employees, while maintenance and senior engineering staff are employed by the private provider. Although the are significant issues associated with a private provider going bankrupt, Partnerships UK believe that arrangements with respect to transfer of business and sale of assets can generally solve the problems which do arise. There will be some risk associated with delays and disruptions, as a PPP contract is an asset in the balance sheet of a private provider, there will always be another buyer willing to step into the shoes of the original provider. However this does not deal with more diffuse issues such as the expertise and quality of the provision of that provider. Partnerships UK believes that the key argument in favour PPPs is effectively and insurance argument. It notes that under traditional public sector provisions of long term infrastructure, an array of risks have usually either been ignored or not adequately taken into account. Therefore costs rising from delays, budget overruns, or poor decisions and poor service quality ultimately are carried by government but not adequately recognised. By shifting these risks to the private provider, even though there is a higher cost of capital, the government is in effect insuring itself against those risks. Rachel Mcllroy from the Trade Union Congress outlined the union movement's concerns about PPPs. She advised that in their experience the transfer of employment to private providers has led to significant erosion of employment conditions for workers particularly the entitlements such as sick leave and holiday pay. It has not led to effective to de-unionisation, but the major union concern was that although the entitlements of existing workers are carried over, new starters would be employed on different terms and conditions. A recent agreement negotiated with the government has resolved this issue, with the government agreeing that all terms and conditions in place for particular workers at the time of transfer of responsibility from the public sector to the private sector would continue, both for existing workers and new starters. The trade union movement believes this has solved the most immediate problem that PPPs present for it, but not some of the more general issues associated with PPPs. 11 280 The TUC is concerned that widespread use of commercial in confidence restrictions is preventing appropriate analysis of public sector comparators as means of determining whether or not PPP is appropriate. The union movement believes that more public scrutiny of these comparisons would reveal that the British people are paying a higher price for PPPs than is justified. They also believe that in many cases the public sector comparators are biased in favour of private provision, for example using outdated instances of public sector failures which overstate the negative associations with public provision. The effective position of the British trade union movement with respect to PPPs would appear to be one of grudging acquiescence. Having satisfactorily addressed the primary issue of terms and conditions of employees, the trade union movement believes that PPPs are a fact of life. However it is clearly committed to continuing to campaign for better public scrutiny of PPPs and to address what it sees as the deficiency of accountability and cost in PPPs. Kevan Nelson, from Unison, the main public sector union outlined in more detail the concerns that his union has with respect to PPPs. Unison believes that PPPs are generally not delivering long term value for money, particularly some of the earlier agreements. Although there has been substantial improvement in the quality of agreements in recent times, they still challenge the claims that they deliver better value for money. Mr Nelson noted that the Blair government abolished compulsory competitive tendering for local authorities and replaced it with a form of market testing and benchmarking that is called Best Value. Unison still has problems with implementation of this mechanism, but believes that it is substantially better than that which prevailed under the previous Conservative government. Mr Nelson outlined how the trade union movement used the Labour national conference as a means to force the Blair government to protect new starters from inferior terms and conditions of employment in PPP projects, but noted that there are some sector areas such as universities where this issue is still unresolved. He believes it will be resolved as the primary areas of direct government employees and local authority employees have been addressed. Mr Nelson pointed out that PPPs have become part of the landscape and have even been embraced by people on the left, particularly in local authorities where they are seen as a means of more speedily delivering infrastructure development projects. He noted that when Martin McGuinness was the Sinn Fein Education Minister in Northern Ireland, he enthusiastically embraced PPPs as a means of upgrading schools. Mr Nelson indicated that the trade union movement would continue to campaign on negative issues associated with PPPs but accepted the reality that they would continue and that they would have to work with them. Mr Nelson provided documentation outlining the detailed Unison case against PPPs, covering issues such as the loss of public service ethos, increased costs compared with the costs of public sector provision, negative effects on the workforce, disruption arising from the bankruptcies, and windfall profits occasionally enjoyed by private providers. 12 Communications Issues I met with Richard Hooper, the deputy head of Otcom, the generic regulator of all communications issues in Britain. Mr Hooper outlined recent developments in telecommunications regulations in Britain, and pointed out a general review of all telecommunications regulations is currently under way. Mr Hooper advised British Telecom has over sixty per cent market share in British Telecommunications, twenty years after it was privatised. He indicated that the so called Last Mile, or customer access network is still a major bottle neck, with BT dominant in directories, with not a great deal of activity having moved to the internet. Mr Hooper advised that although Otcom is strongly attracted to the idea of forcing full structural separation upon BT, it is conscious of the fact there is little government support for this approach. It is therefore arguing for much stricter internal separation within BT, including separate companies with separate boards, and a strict, Equivalence\" to apply to products sold by or provided by BT wholesale to both BT retail and to its competitors. Aware that it faces serious regulatory pressure, BT is proposing to establish a separate Access Services Division, which would involve the customer access network being internally separated into a separate company with a separate board. Ofcom is supportive of this approach, which it believes is only emerging from BT under the threat of full structural separation. Mr Hooper advised that although Voice Over Internet Protocol telephony is progressing, developments have been relatively slow. Mr Hooper also advised of developments in digital television, pointing out that it is now possible to obtain digital conversion boxes well below \u00e2\u00ac50 and that the digital tree to air television service Freeview which provides thirty TV stations and radio stations, is now in over fifty percent of households. He advised that a complete switch off of analogue television is planned for 2012, and that the government expects that somewhere around fifteen per cent of households will still not have digital at that point. He believes that the government will then subsidise the provision of set top boxes for the remaining consumers. Mr Hooper also advised that digital radio is advancing, with \u00e2\u00ac70 receivers sold, and general progress of this new means of radio transmission. I met with Mr Simon Broad, Senior Distribution Manager, & Mr Richard Waghorn, BBC Distribution. They outlined in detail recent developments with respect to digital television in Britain. They advised that the cheapest digital conversion box is now \u00e2\u00ac39, with people typically paying \u00a350-\u00e2\u00ac55. They pointed out that there are now a wider variety of appliances with different functions and prices available. For \u00e2\u00ac170 it is now possible to buy a digital set top box which also functions as a personal video recorder capable of storing up to forty hours of programming. 13 282 They advised that Freeview has no premium content such as movies or major sport, it's channels are mostly equivalent to the minor channels that are found on pay TV. Approximately sixty per cent of homes now have digital television, and forty per cent have pay TV. There is a non profit consortium of the major Freeview providers, Sky TV, BBC, Crown Castle which spend \u00a310 million per annum promoting Freeview. It would appear that there has been no net reduction in television advertising revenue as a result of emergence of digital, with the reduction in advertising on analogue being counter acted by the emergence of advertising on digital. Mr Broad and Mr Waghorn advised that although there is no current broadcast of high definition signals, this is planned by SkyTV for 2006. The BBC is making much of its product in high definition, but is not actually broadcasting. They advised that the BBC intends to gradually move to making all of its broadcasting product in high definition. Trade Union Relations with Blair Government I discussed the relationship between the trade union movement and the Blair Government with Mr Owen Tudor, director of International Relations for the Trade Union Congress. He advised that although there had been numerous disputes and disagreements between the trade union movement and the Blair government recent developments had produced a more productive relationship in particular an agreement recently struck between the four large unions, Unison, Amicus, T&G, G&B, at Warwick with the government, covering a wide range of issues, had improved relationships. This agreement covered approximately fifty issues, including employment protection in the public sector, reform of PPP analysis, oversight of maintenance work in the rail sector, equal pay, healthy eating in schools, occupational health and safety, industrial manslaughter, workers entitlements protection, redundancy pay, Low Pay Commission, family friendly working hours, child care, pensions, research and development investments, export credits, regional development, disability rights, and transport safety. Mr Tudor advised that amalgamations in the trade movement had led to four giant unions, with another tier of middle sized unions and then another of specialist unions. He believes that trade union membership, which had been falling for a number of years has stabilised. The Trade Union Congress plays a broadly advisory and research role for the major unions, and does not negotiate on their behalf. I also discussed the state of trade union relations with the Blair government with Rachel Mcllroy from the TUC and Kevan Nelson from the Trade Union Unison. Their comments broadly concurred with those of Mr Tudor. They indicated that although the union movement had many disagreements with the Blair government particularly over its participation over the war in Iraq, they acknowledged it had done many positive things for working people such as increased child benefit, improvements in government schooling, and substantial increases in the National Health Service, 14 283 The Election Prospects of the Blair Government I met with a number of Labour ministers and members of parliament, John Spellar, Peter Ham, David Miliband, John Cruddas, and Chris Smith. I discussed the impending election with them, spaning a variety of particular issues and concerns. Chris Smith and John Cruddas were both concerned that although the Blair government had done many good things for their working class constituents, it had not promoted these achievements for \"fear of unsettling middle England\" suggesting that the government was similar to previous Labour governments. This meant that although Labour's traditional constituency had benefited greatly from the Blair Government, it was generally unaware of this and therefore in some cases may not bother to vote. John Cruddas discussed the rise of the British National Party, which is in his East London electorate a serious threat amongst working class white voters. He indicated that he initiated a group called Dagenham Together, bringing together community groups, churches and local representatives, as a means of fighting the race hatred being spread by the British National Party. He also discussed the changes in housing prices and the effect this was having on particular groups of people in his electorate. Chris Smith advised about prospects of introducing more gambling, with the plan to allow up to eight giant casinos now in jeopardy. Mr Smith also advised some middle class professional constituents in his electorate where disenchanted with the Blair Government because of the Iraq war and the erosion of civil liberties, and were at risk of voting for the Liberal Democrats Mr Smith is retiring at this election, and is concemed without his significant personal vote in this typically strong Labour electorate, there is some risk of Labour actually losing the seat. I discussed the Conservative electoral strategy with Peter Ham, David Miliband, and John Spellar. I expressed my view that there was a separate significant deficiency in the Blair governments strategy in that it was relying too much on its record and not enough on a new agenda for a third term. They indicated that they were working on the ideas for the challenges ahead. I had substantial discussions with all three ministers about the Blair governments approach to re-election, and particular the likely impact of Australian influence in the conservative party of Lynton Crosbie advising conservative leader Michael Howard. I also discussed the British election situation with other people that I met with particularly Tom Bentley from Demos and Michael Jacobs, special advisor to Chancellor Gordon Brown. Mr Jacobs outline the areas of disagreement between Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, on issues of privatisation of Health and Education. Mr Jacobs outlined his role in advising the chancellor on environmental issues particularly climate change, and developments in health and public sector reform. The British Treasury plays a monitoring role with respect to most issues in the various other departments, and Mr Jacobs role as a special advisor reflects this. He advised in his view there was a need to strengthen the portrayal of a clear third term agenda on a part of the government, and that work was under way to ensure this would occur. I met also with Mr Matt Browne, the Director of the Policy Network, a international organisation based in London which develops and maintains 15 284 relationships between centre left parties around the world particularly, with those in government. The Policy Network plays a role in co-ordinating policy discussion across national boundaries with the aim of improving policy development and strengthening relationships with similar parties from different countries. I discussed the mechanics of this approach with Mr Browne, and also the importance of ensuring that parties like the ALP and the British Labour Party continue to engage in policy renewal. We discussed the circumstances of the Blair government election challenge culminating particularly the lack of clear future agenda as the basis for its re-election. I met with Mr Martin Woollacott, Mr Martin Kettle and Mr Michael White, senior journalists with The Guardian. We discussed in detail the prospect for the Blair Government's re-election, in particular the significance of Australian influences of the conservative election campaign. They provided interesting commentary on the degree of disillusionment with Prime Minister Tony Blair amongst middle class people in particular those concerned about the Iraq war and issues such as civil liberties. They do not believe that support for the Conservative Party is likely to increase significantly in the election, but there is a significant threat to the Blair government arising from the likelihood of some of its supporters failing to vote, and others defecting to the Liberal Democrats. Relational Issues I met with Superintendent Ian Jenkins from the Safer Neighbourhoods Unit, in the Metropolitan Police. He outlined their new strategy of Reassurance Policing\" which focuses on reducing fear of crime and closing the gap between fear of crime and actual crime levels. This involves more police doing different things. The primary element of this strategy is to deliver new six person teams into every local government ward in London of which there are six hundred and twenty four. This strategy is part financed by a special tax on London constituents and part financed by the National government. Three hundred teams of six people are already in place, and statistics show crime reductions are greater in areas where these teams are operating. The teams consist of police, community liaison officers, and social relations experts. These teams engage in widespread community consultation about local community issues particularly crime and disorder issues, with the aim of developing an action plan to tackle these issues and report continually to the local community. They can not be redeployed for other police work, and are engaged in proactive policing where as traditional policing is responsive or reactive to criminal activity. Most of the people employed in these teams have prior policing experience. Initially existing police members were resistant to moving into these teams, and were sceptical about the benefit, but that attitude has been turned around as a result of the perceived success of this strategy. As far as Superintendent Jenkins is aware there is nothing as comprehensive as this strategy being employed in any other countries, although there are 16 some cities in the United States where similar developments are occurring. There are also similar strategies being developed in other parts of Britain. Superintendent Jenkins also outlined the developments with respect to Anti Social Behaviour Orders (ASBO). Although there have been some teething problems associated with these orders, in that they have tended to be expensive and cumbersome, recent process reforms have improved the situation. Typically an ASBO involves an offender being banned from a particular area or facility for a substantial period, such as five years, They are different from traditional criminal Justice in that they only require a balance of probabilities level of proof, not beyond reasonable doubt, and they are specific to the offence. Therefore for example a typical offender will be banned from central London for five years or banned from railway stations or trains or some other facility. ASBOs have been used to deal with problems such as constant harassment of neighbours, offensive behaviour, or ticket touting. They typically relate to people causing alarm harassment, fear or distress, especially where there is persistent repetition involved. They have been used to deal with drug dealers, by banning them from attending particular places. There is concern that people with mental illnesses may be unfairly targeted by ASBOs, and so that aspect of the program, is currently under review. The police are developing anti-social behaviour contracts, as an informal alternative to ASBOs, which involve a voluntary contract being entered into between the offender and the police, sometimes with a housing authority as a party. This is particularly appropriate where there are troublesome neighbours or offensive behaviour involved, where if a contract is breached, the next step is to obtain a formal ASBO. The police have also got the power to impose an \u00a380 on the spot fine for public disorder which is linked to the process of getting an ASBO. There has been little community opposition to ASBOs, and there has been no organised political campaign against them. They have proved particularly effective in tackling serious drug problems, such as closing crack houses. They have enabled the police to crack down on a range of serious public problems, without having to use all the means of the traditional criminal justice system. I met with Michael Schluter and John Ashcroft of the Relationships Foundation, with whom I've had a long term relationship, in order to discuss the application of relational policies to the aged care sector. They have been conducting research on this issue for some time. Mr Schluter and Mr Ashcroft advised they are working on the concept of an intergenerational contract, focusing on supporting carers and people in their home environments as long as possible. They are considering options that involve aged people buying apartments in special apartment blocks designed for aged people with serious support requirements, which can then be on sold once they have eventually died. They are aiming to break down barriers between housing and welfare provision, and particularly they envision a new role for housing associations which would provide specialist housing services. They hope that in the longer term the provision of aged care in Britain will enable people to move from low care to high care provision while remaining in the same location. This may involve apartment blocks where some apartments are designed for relatively independent living, whereas others are designed for intensive care and assistance. As people's health gradually deteriorates, they would at most only 17 be required to move from one apartment to another in the same facility. They advise there are many problems in Britain with nursing home care disrupting relationships, splitting up couples and locating people sometimes long distances away from their loved ones. The Relationships Foundation is working on the concept of a \"Supportive Society\" with much stronger support for carers. They advocate the co-location of aged care facilities with Primary Schools in order to expose older people to young children. They are concerned about the artificial division between the National Health Service and Social Security, because health care is universally provided, whereas social security is means tested. Aged care services tend to fall between the two of these and therefore there are many anomalies. They are concerned to ensure that gradual improvements to the standard of care are delivered as a result of investment occurring now, and to ensure that longer term investment leads to major increases in the quality of aged care in Britian. I met with Will Hutton former editor of the Observer, and now the director of the Work Foundation. The Work Foundation Is a non-government organisation dedicated to improving the quality of British workplaces and economic performance of British industry. Mr Hutt -ton advised that their focus is on five key relationships: with shareholders, innovators, customers, broad stake holders, and employees. The Foundation undertakes a variety of research with respect to workplace issues such as training, skills, innovation, and industrial relations. Mr Hutton advised that the Blair government has introduced radical new training support measures to facilitate the acquisition of new skills by mature workers. All people aged between 16 and 64 now have the right to obtain paid leave from work in order to obtain training qualifications equivalent to GCSE level in Britain. Mr Hutton expressed a view that this would lead to a dramatic change that will have profound implications for economic performance and living standards for Britain into the future as people who have not had these skills will have now much greater opportunity to obtain them. I met with Richard Layard, from the London School of Economics, who has written extensively on the significance of happiness as a vital social indicator and in particular on fact that although Western societies are immensely richer than they were decades ago there is little evidence that people are happier. I discussed issues associated with this thesis which is contained in Professor Layard's book Happiness, and also alerted him to the work of Michael Schluter and John Ashcroft from the Relationships Foundation. He alerted me to the work occurring in various parts of the world, particularly the United States on these issues, where academics are taking a broader view of community well being than the typically dominant measurement of economic growth. We discussed in detail issues involved in changing the focus of centre left political parties to include broader issues of family life and relationships. We also considered the potential for the development of a formal international network. 18 Germany Economic Reform and Reunification Dr Chirstian Wey, Head of the Department of Information Society and Competition, German Institute for Economic Research discussed with me the Haartz plan of economic reform which has been partly adopted by the Schroeder Government in Germany. He advised that virtually uniform labour market regulation had been adopted within four years of reunification of West and East Germany, but this is now being eroded by companies in East Germany in practice paying lower rates of pay because of lower productivity. He indicated it's hard to tell how many companies were moving production to the former communist countries of Eastern Europe, but he believed that this would not be a major problem in the longer term for Germany. He pointed out that strictly speaking the German labour market is not heavily regulated, but in practice it is dominated by unions and employer organisations that reach detailed agreements that in effect become labour market regulation. Dr Wey indicated that one of the major problems facing Germany is that much of the money that has been transferred to East Germany is going into consumption rather than investment, and many young people are still migrating to the west. Smaller towns and villages are losing population as a result of this trend. Science and education are mainstays of the local economy of Berlin, together with media. Most of the major German companies have not moved headquarters to Berlin, although Government organisations such as Deutsche Bahn (The National Rail System) have done so. Many companies are headquartered in Munich and since reunification have retained headquarters there. Dr Katharina Erdmenger, who is the Head of Section, Redevelopment of the East, Structural and Regional Policy, Business and Industry Policy German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB), outlined the structure of the German trade union movement, which now consists of eight very large unions covering white collar and health and media, metal industry, mining and chemicals, police, education, construction and agriculture, transport, and hospitality and general. The DGB's primary function is policy development, research and lobbying. The industrial relations system operates around a separate set of specialised courts, and industry wide wage agreements. German employers have been pushing for the introduction of enterprise bargaining similar to the Australian system, but this has been resisted by the union movement and the SchrOeder government. The DGB is not expecting a new wave of economic reform between now and the election, after serious protests about the Haartz reforms. In spite of exports remaining strong, Germany has over five million unemployed and although casual and part-time temporary employment is increasing, there are still deeply entrenched unemployment problems. Like Dr Wey, Dr Erdmenger does not believe in the move of production in to Eastern Europe is a major problem for the German economy or the trade union movement. 19 Following reunification a lot of older men in East Germany were effectively unemployed because of inadequate skills and lack of productive enterprises. Particular threatened sectors such as the textile and steel sectors in the East have managed to survive through pursing strategies of specialisation, focusing on very narrow niches in their sectors. Some areas of East Germany particularly smaller towns previously dependent on a single enterprise that has closed down have become virtual desperate waste lands. The DGB is unhappy with the economic direction of the Schroeder government, but is still co-operating and supporting the government. Dr Erdmenger advised that although the DGB and the German trade union movement are broadly liked with and supportive of the Social Democratic Party, there are key figures in the union movement associated with other parties. There is an executive member of the DGB, from the Teachers Union who is a member of the Christian Democratic Union, and the president of Verdi is a member of the Greens. Konstantin Woinoff, who is responsible for Australia, International Policy Division in the Social Democratic Party (SOP) advised that the Schroeder government is now paying a heavy price having promised to halve unemployment when first elected in the 1998 election. Gerhard SchrOeder was advised by political consultant Dick Morris to avoid talking about economic issues in the 2002 German election and focus on the issue of Iraq which helped the SOP to a narrow victory. The SPD is now in the process of building its election program for the 2006 election, with a domestic policy focus that will deal primarily with issues of health care, the future of the German Army, and the structure of social insurance. The SPD is also keen to develop a major foreign policy issue for the election, which may be the continuing campaign for a permanent position on the UN Security Council for Germany. I had a lengthy discussion with Mr Woinoff about Australian Foreign Policy and the position of the Howard government as he was eager to learn more about Australia's policy in Asia. That is a key area of his responsibility for the SPD. Dr Rolf Mutzenich is an SPD member of the of the German Parliament who was elected to represent Cologne in 2002. He has fourteen per cent unemployment in his electorate which is dominated by a large Ford factory which has laid off around 6,000 workers over the last ten years. He has a number of media companies in his electorate, and the services sector is growing. He was previously a public servant in the Health Ministry and then office of the President State Parliament for North Rhine-Westphalia. Dr MUtzenich advised that provision of social services is effectively split between the federal government and local authorities, and that recent reforms that Labour market programs are more proactive and focused on getting people back into work. Councils have played a significant role in this process. Unemployment amongst people over fifty Is a major problem in Germany, and reunification is still a major drain on Germany's economic resources, particularly through the system of transfers. 20 Dr M\u00c3\u00bctzenich advised the past two years the SPD has lost around 200,000 members, reducing its overall membership to 600,000, because of its pursuit of economic reform policy. He was critical of the party's failure to use its time in opposition to develop new policies, and therefore the perceived betrayal of its traditional position that was involved in processes such as Haartz reforms. Dr MUtzenich observed that dealing with reunification and economic regulatory reform was a huge challenge for Germany. I discussed the political problems the SPD is suffering as a result of endeavouring to deal with these challenges. He advised that Party of Democratic Socialism, the former the Communist Party from Eastern Germany is attracting mostly older people associated with the former elite in East Germany. He pointed out that the SPD has a good working relationship with the Greens, particularly as their position have now began to change as a result as a generation of young people that started supporting the Greens now becoming relatively well off professionals and in many cases indistinguishable from SPD voters. I met with Ms Gerlinde Bahre, and her son Ron Bahre, who both ordinary citizens from the former East Germany. For many years as a child and a young adult I corresponded with her father, Mr Erich Schindler. As well as catching up on matters of personal interest, I discussed with her and her son life in East Germany since reunification. She is a secondary school teacher, and has indicated that in many parts of East Germany including her own, which is just south of Berlin, schools are closing because of lack of pupils. Both because of immigration of young people, and people choosing not to have children in Eastern Germany, there has been a dramatic drop in the population growth rate. This is causing major economic problems in many small towns such as the one she grew up in, because they remain dominated by older people and lack the dynamism delivered by growth and youth. Ms Ulrike H\u00c3\u00a4fken, a Greens member of the German parliament, advised me of on the Greens position on various issues, particularly consumer protection and economic regulation. She outlined the Greens position with respect to genetically modified organisms, and advised of a recent scandal involving the exporting of Bt corn from the United States to Europe which included an antibiotic gene in this particular genetically modified corn which is banned. Ms HOfken outlined her role as spokesperson on Consumer Affairs for the Greens and advised that responsibility for Consumer Affairs had been merged in Germany into a single ministry covering agriculture and nutrition also. This Ministry has developed action plans to ensure there are strict labelling laws to guarantee transparency and disclosure with respect to food ingredients coming from genetically modified organisms. The Greens have three ministers in the German government, Foreign Minister, Environment Minister, Consumer Protection Minister. She believes that the conservatives attitude to consumer regulation has been improving as result of public opinion. The broad framework of consumer regulation is established by the European Union in Brussels but there is a lot interaction 21 and negotiation between the member state with respect to implementation of these rules. Ms HOfken advised that Greens support is growing more quickly in rural areas than anywhere else though it has traditionally been highest in the major cities. The Greens are much stronger in Western Germany, with only one parliament in Eastern Germany having any Green MPs. In part this is due the strength of the Party of Democratic Socialism in the East, which attracts voters who may otherwise vote for the Greens. The Greens are only involved in one coalition government at the state level, which is the largest state of North Rhine-Westphalia. State elections are due in approximately five weeks time in North Rhine-Westphalia, where the Social Democratic Party is at risk of loosing a traditional heartland state. Ms HOfken advised that the Greens recognise that there is a need for economic and regulatory reform for Germany but they are concerned to ensure that this reform does not adversely affect people who are not able to deal with those reforms. Mr Richard Hilmer, the Managing Director of Infratest, a leading political and electoral research company, provided insights into the effect of economic reform issues on public opinion. He advised that the SDP government has consistently been polling below thirty per cent for some time after a brief recovery and that the combined conservative parties have been polling over forty five per cent. He believes the Schroeder government is in trouble, but that if it pursues a bold reform program it will be able to retain office. He advised that the section of the German community most resistant to economic reform is those people in middle age and late middle age. There is a very strong attachment to strong social security in Germany, and little acceptance of the notion that economic reform is required. Germans are extremely worried about the high level of unemployment and economic insecurity, and therefore are reluctant to reduce the system of social support that they take a great deal of pride in and which they see as having provided a foundation for modern Germany and inhibiting the growth of extremism which has blighted Germany's past. I briefly discussed issues of economic reform in Germany with Ms Pamela Fayle , the Australian Ambassador. She experienced this process in the 1980s as a government staffer. In our discussion we compared the way these issues were being dealt with in Germany to the way they were dealt with in Australia. The Impact of the Nazi past In Germany I visited the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, which is on the outskirts of Berlin. I undertook a tour of the camp which has been preserved as a memorial to those who died there. The preservation of the camp and reconstruction of certain features of the camp has only occurred in relatively recent times, as in the former Eastern Germany It was not until 1961 that there was any kind of memorial erected there. 22 291 I discussed the continuing German reaction to the horrors of Nazism with our guide and various others that we met. It is clear that a very heavy burden of guilt is still very strong in Germany. I discussed these issues with Gerlinde Bahre, and she advised me that her father after serving six years in the German army during the war, spent three years as a prisoner of war. Her mothers family lost their house in the Sudeten land of Czechoslovakia, which after the end of the Second World War was ethnically cleansed of Germans. Significantly, she stated that she and her brother had been brought up by her parents not to hate Russians or Czechs, rather that there are good and bad people in all races. This was an interesting indication of the willingness of ordinary Germans to try and break the cycle of violence and hatred that had peaked with Nazism. I also visited the new Jewish Museum in Berlin and studied many of the Exhibits particular relating to the Nazi period. The great value of both this museum and the exhibits at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp is the way they personalised the tragedies of so many people. There are many exhibits which give brief biographies of individuals who died in the Holocaust and also individuals who were members of the German Parliament who were murdered by the Nazis for their political beliefs. Studying these biographies and looking at the photographs of the people involved has a much more powerful impact than merely reading the statistics of a large number of otherwise anonymous individuals who were murdered. Telecommunications Requlatlons Dr Christian Wey outlined in detail the application Otcompetition policy in telecommunications in Germany. There is a major effort to reduce the Intensity of regulation, and a new super regulator is being formed to cover telecommunications, postal services, and energy. Deutsche Telecom is still completely dominant in the telecommunications market, particularly in broadband. European Union directives play the primary role in telecommunications regulation. Deutsche Telecom (DI) is still part owned by the German government, but the government plans to sell its stake in the near future. There has only been a slight reduction in staff numbers in DT. DT operates its own intemet service provider. Televison in Berlin has converted completely to digital and it is expected that other parts of Germany will soon change over. The German government indirectly subsidises this conversion. There are approximately thirty channels now broadcast to viewers in Berlin, compared with around sixteen under the analogue system. Cable television providers have been complaining vociferously about the increase in the number of channels, because that has increased the level of competition that they face in the market place. 23 292 Conclusion This study leave trip has proved enormously valuable for me in deepening my knowledge of public private partnerships in the country where they were created and are still most prominent, Britain. I've also learned a good deal about recent developments in Telecommunications and broadcasting regulation in both Britain and Germany. As both countries have centre left governments one of which is an economically strong position and the other which is not, I was able to observe an interesting contrast in the policy and political challenges facing the two governments. As I have not previously visited Germany, I feel that direct exposure to the reminders of Germany's recent past is a valuable aid to understanding the modern politics of Europe. It is very clear that Germany is still dominated by guilt about its Nazi past, and the need to be a model international citizen for the deeds of sixty years ago. Although I have read a great deal about Nazism and the Holocaust, no reading could create the impact of visiting a concentration camp.

I also investigated New Zealand's policy governing native vegetation management, the management of their National Parks and control of feral animals I met with both government Ministers and opposition spokesmen in the relevant portfolio areas. These meetings were conducted on Wednesday, 6 April and Thursday 7 April. The discussions that took place were most useful in helping me understand the political implications for the policies of the various political parties. I also discussed in broad terms the political Multi Member Party (MMP) system of electing their parliament and their thoughts on the possibilities of expanding Closer Economic Relations (CER).

Reforms to the tax system and the elimination of practically all statutory marketing authorities have led to New Zealand's export sector being globally more competitive. From our discussions I gained the impression that New Zealand's business sector would like to further progress reforms. They are very aware of the potential changes in Australia when the Government Senate majority takes effect on July 1. New Zealand business is envious of our position because they believe that under the Multi Member Party (MMP) system none of the major parties will ever govern alone and therefore are not proposing major structural changes to industrial relations. They are also very critical of New Zealand's policy on native vegetation management (see Appendix A, B, C, and D). Report prepared by The Hon Bruce Scott MP, Member for Maranoa 303 r f :i .1 \u00e2\u00a2 I .1 \u00e2\u00a2 I Federated Farmers meetin\u00c3\u00a7 -I Catherine Petrey, Policy Director Jacob Haronga, Policy Adviser :i Monday, 4 April 2005 At this meeting I discussed telecommunications and indigenous vegetation management particularly the impact and any benefits of deregulation of telecommunications on the farming sector in New Zealand. An example of why we should not emulate New Zealand's procedures was that the date for entitlement to access telephone and internet services was 2001, called KIWI-SHARE. This means that if you were a subscriber to Telecom New Zealand in 2001 you would then come under the equivalent of our Australian Universal Service Obligations (USO) entitling you to maintenance of your existing service connections and basic internet service. The basic service only guarantees minimum 9.6 KB/second dial-up, and 95% of subscribers guaranteed 14.4KB/second. This is inadequate and unacceptable to rural people. An instance was quoted of a farmer corning home for lunch, dialling up to retrieve his emails, tying up his telephone line, and finishing lunch only to find his few emails were still slowly downloading. Another alarming story was of a farmer who got up at 3am to do his banking because of the slowness tying up his line for so long. With changing land use (e.g from agriculture to horticulture or the wine industry) one line is totally insufficient as farmers diversify into new business opportunities. More service connections for these people under KIWI-SHARE are prohibitively expensive. Distance and terrain affect the cost of any connections for rural families. For further details please see the notes from the meeting from Douglas Webb. Report prepared by The Hon Bruce Scott MP, Member for Maranoa 304 10 Meeting with Douglas Webb Douglas Webb, Telecommunications Commissioner Catherine Petrey, Policy Director with Federated Farmers Jacob Haronga Policy Adviser with Federated Farmers Monday, 4 April 2005 In discussions with the Telecommunications Commissioner I was told that the purpose of the Commerce Commission is to promote dynamic and responsive markets so that New Zealanders benefit from competitive prices, better quality and greater choice. I was particularly interested in gaining an understanding of the cost of servicing non-viable communications customers in New Zealand. I was advised that the Commission estimates that 65,000 customers are considered non-viable and most of these are located outside town areas. The estimated cost of servicing these customers is $57 million annually which is paid for under the USO. However, Telecom New Zealand claims the cost is some seven to eight times higher. I was further advised that Telecom New Zealand generates 80% of all communications revenue in New Zealand. Telecom New Zealand is regarded as the last resort provider to those considered non-viable. It was explained to me that KIWI-SHARE was established in 2001 to guarantee existing services remain covered by the USO. New connections post this date are proving to be very expensive. This was reiterated at a meeting with representatives of Federated Farmers New Zealand who gave alarming examples of their members' experiences (see Appendix E regarding a newspaper article detailing some of the comments showing the frustrations of farmers). Report prepared by The Hon Bruce Scott MP, Member for Maranoa II For any new connections customers are required to pay 80% of the cost after the first $3,000. The average cost of these connections is in the order of $25,000; the highest mentioned to me was nearly $80,000. Under KIWI-SHARE Telecom New Zealand, as the USO, are only required to provide dial-up internet speeds of 9.6Kb per second. This covers 99% of New Zealand households. To quote farming representatives \"Don't do what New Zealand did\". Farmers and people living in rural areas are the most disadvantaged since privatisation of the telecommunications network. Report prepared by The Hon Bruce Scott MP, Member for Maranoa 306 I 12 Meeting with Richard Riddiford Managing Director of Palliser Estate Winery Tuesday, 5 April 2005 This meeting was held at the winery and my purpose was to discuss the change in land use since the deregulation of statutory marketing authorities in New Zealand. Richard Riddiford was the recipient of the prestigious award of New Zealand Food and Beverage Exporter of the Year 2004. Palliser Estate Winery was established in 1989 and the business has had a significant impact locally because of the wine/tourism market, and land prices in the area have soared. Land that had formerly been used mainly for growing small crops and for horticulture is now vineyards. Riddiford himself retains his interest in raising deer for the venison export market on land nearby which his family has farmed for generations. His focus is on premium quality wines with 40% of his product is sold domestically. He exports to 12 countries, most recently establishing a market in Moscow where he claims there are more 5-star restaurants than in New York or London. He is the first New Zealand winemaker to travel to Russia to seek a market for his wines. Australian and New Zealand wines compete on the world market. He places great emphasis on servicing clients rather than relying on distributors especially for servicing overseas markets. He is one of only four winemakers worldwide to be ISO 14,000 compliant. His challenge is to be able to receive a premium for being clean, green and ISO compliant. He says the consumer does not want to have to pay a premium for these qualities. He concedes that all wine is sold on price but he is working to establish a market where a premium can be received from environmentally sound practices.

This was amply demonstrated as the staff of the National Park combine with business enterprises to achieve an admirable outcome by working together. Both the summer tourists who walk around the area on treks several days tong and the winter tourists who ski are catered for by a cooperative effort by the conservation staff and the big business of the skifields. Rubbish disposal and sewerage treatment are big-ticket items and are managed locally. One good example of the sensible management is that when sewerage pipes were laid, optic fibre cables were laid in the same trench. Funding for these cables came from a levy on gross revenue of businesses within the Park. Feral animals, notably possums (60 million in New Zealand) stoats and weasels - all introduced species - are devastating native fauna Only 20,000 Kiwis are left in the whole of New Zealand, demonstrating the severity of the problem. Attempts to eradicate or control these feral animals are ongoing and the use of 1080 within the Park is currently proving to be successful. A recently developed tonglife 1080, which is a commercially prepared bait, has replaced baited carrots. The advantage of the new bait is that it does not break up into small particles, as is the case with carrots. By allowing for the use of 1080 to control feral animals is in contrast to the practices in Australia's National Parks. Businesses and Park staff who live within the Park all have a say in its management, through the form of a local committee. This is a great example of local issues being dealt with locally. Report prepared by The Hon Bruce Scott MP, Member for Maranoa 308 A 14 Meetinq with Stephen Seliwood CEO of Council for Infrastructure Development Monday, 11 April 2005 We discussed many issues that affect our two countries. Apart from the road and port infrastructure challenges, there is a major need for New Zealand to meet the increasing demand for energy, mainly electricity. The policy agenda for the future will be driven by the government needing to comply with the Kyoto protocols as New Zealand is a signatory. During the meeting I canvassed the possibility of New Zealand being a market for Australia's natural gas and ethanol. This should be addressed by our authorities to ascertain feasibility. Investment in infrastructure in NZ could come from the Australian business sector. Toll Holdings have already invested in New Zealand's rail transport sector. The investment market in New Zealand has the attraction of not having the imposts of Stamp Duty, Land Tax, Investment Tax (NSW) or Capital Gains Tax. Because of the need to upgrade road access to ports, the New Zealand Government has recently imposed an additional five cents per litre Fuel Tax as well as indexing annually this fuel tax to CPI. A percentage of the fuel tax collected is directed to the road network, with the balance going to consolidated revenue. It will be interesting to note any commitments made by the major parties when the impending New Zealand election is called. Report prepared by The Hon Bruce Scott MP, Member for Maranoa 309 Meeting with TELSTRA CLEAR Rose Hart, Head of Corporate and Government Affairs Rosemary Howard, CEO of TELSTRA CLEAR Monday, 11 April 2005 ii :i .4 In my discussions with Telstra Clear (a division of Telstra Australia) I was interested to have Telstra Clear's opinion on how they compete with Telecom New Zealand following privatisation. It seems that Telstra Clear has difficulty gaining a competitive share of the market because of the regulations which heavily favour Telecom New Zealand. When I asked if there are market failures I was given a clear indication that in up to 10 to 15% of the communications market, it is difficult to sustain a profitable business especially in rural and regional New Zealand. Clearly competition for this share of the market does not exist. Expectation of the Government was that competition would flourish after the privatisation in the mid 80s, but as no regulations were introduced it went into a vacuum and Telecom New Zealand flourished. Customers connected to a fixed line pay a mandatory $40 a month line charge to Telecom New Zealand. This impost allows free local calls. Many people would prefer to pay for their local calls as most people now use mobile phones to make these calls (up to 25% of local calls are made using mobile phones). Attempts to overturn this regulatory charge went as far as the Privy Council but the case was lost. Post the 1999 election a Ministerial Enquiry was held into Telecommunications and as a result there has been a Telecommunications Commissioner since then. They still don't have un-bundling of local loop even though it was recommended in a draft report Following a reversal of the Minister's recommendation by Cabinet the proposal was scrapped. Thus New Zealand is the only developed country not to un-bundle local loop. New Zealand is also the only developed country without portability of mobile numbers. For Internet access, only Telecom New Zealand can build on the copper networks (different from Australia). Telstra Report prepared by The Hon Bruce Scott MP, Member for Maranoa 30 - I 16 Clear has therefore built its own network. There are two reasons for this; Telecom New Zealand is completely in charge and the slow speeds have resulted in a poor uptake. Under KIWI-SHARE legislated in 2001 the requirement is only 14.4 Kb. I was told that three players have been squashed because of poor customer experience. Telecom has been seen to lower their price street by street to push out competitors, so even though these other businesses received huge government funding to establish in the market, they have had to let contracts go in the face of impossible odds. As yet it seems there is no fixed wireless network, which would give a viable alternative to the existing copper wire network, though scientists say that the copper wire has assumed another lifetime - a hundred years - because of DSL. Speeds are a huge concern and frustrating to everyone especially when homes are too far from exchanges (see Appendix E). Farming communities are particularly affected by this. I was left in no doubt after this meeting that there is not a level playing field in the communications market in New Zealand and that it is important to have more than one strong player in the market.

I also investigated current trends in immigration and border protection policies in the UK - a highly relevant discussion in the lead-up to the British election - and the approaches to this policy area espoused by the major parties. I have recently been instrumental in establishing a Parliamentary coalition group to address the areas of taxation and welfare policy in Australia; in particular, the high levels of taxation in this country and the present lack of integration between taxation and social welfare which has created a disincentive for people to move from welfare benefits into employment. Like Australia, with the implications of their ageing populations and declining workforce participation, the Bush and Blair Administrations have outlined plans to reform the social security system to better reflect current trends and economic and social realities. Australia is not immune to these challenges. Therefore it was greatly informative to explore the policy responses that the Americans and the British have adopted and examine whether there are any implications for the Australian taxation and income support systems from such approaches. Many meetings held in the USA discussed the recent election results in Australia and the USA, where some similarities were noticed and general trends in voting patterns in these two jurisdictions observed. The convincing electoral success enjoyed by President Bush and Prime Minister Howard was a major feature of these discussions, along with Australia's military effort in Iraq and the economic, strategic, defence and trading links fostered between our two countries, particularly in light of the successful passage of legislation for the USA-Australia Free Trade Agreement which was enacted on i January 2005. Another major focus of my tour was to investigate bushfire mitigation and natural resource management in the context of controlling wildfires that impact on the Australian environment, private and public assets and local communities. The practical implications of President Bush's Healthy Forests Initiative were a feature of these discussions. Much debate has transpired within the bushfire-fighting community and associated agencies and environmental bodies on the adequacy and economic and environmental impact of hazard reduction and other strategies for bushfire prevention. Significant parts of the environmental movement have opposed the removal or reduction of forest fuel loads. I was instrumental in the establishment of the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Recent Australian Bushfires, and participated in the inquiry as a committee member, and therefore relished the opportunity of speaking with leading academics and government agencies on this matter. The United States has embarked on a similar public debate concerning land management and bushfire prevention. One aspect of particular interest is the adequacy and efficacy of the current methods of attacking bushfires at the point of ignition. The USA has incorporated an innovative policy of aerial attack by heavy, fixed-wing aircraft capable of carrying large amounts of water to douse the flames. Australia, on the other hand, seems currently wedded to the use of aerial assets with small capacities. Australia has recently committed to aerial response teams, however I feel there could be many positive implications that would flow to Australian communities as a result of adopting some of the practices employed by the USA in combating wildfire. My understanding is that America is expanding the use and capacity of heavy fixed-wing aerial bombers. For my part, these were immensely rewarding discussions, particularly as they impact on my electorate which saw the full brunt of unnatural feral fire in 2003, that claimed some 1.3 million hectares of public and private land. To this end, I have already held discussions with local environmental advocacy groups in my electorate - who are deeply concerned with the general management of national parks - on the outcome of my discussions with the US Forest Service and other agencies, and what lessons might be learnt for our own local authorities. In Greece, I met with a number of local businessmen who were keen to foster stronger economic and trade links with Australia, along with members of the Australia-Greece Parliamentary Friendship Group. Also, I was fortunate to attend and participate in the gathering of the International Democratic Union (IDU), a working association of over 8o Conservative, Christian Democrat and like minded political parties of the Centre and Centre-Right held this year in Athens. This year's gathering was chaired by the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. John Howard MP. Other Meetings: In London, I was fortunate to meet with Dr Patrick Sookhdeo, the International Director of the Barnabas Fund. This was an immensely rewarding meeting, discussing the work of the Barnabas Fund throughout the world in protecting persecuted Christian minorities, and the rise of Islam in many places and what consequences this holds for the world. He spoke passionately about what he felt was the dangers of 'multiculturalism' and the concept of ethnic identities unbound by any larger culture to unite the people - what former British Home Secretary David Blunkett refers to as 'integration by diversity'. Sookhdeo stated his firm conviction that multiculturalism has developed into voluntary separatism, or essentially 'parallel societies'. We talked about the Victorian Government's attempt to deal with racial and religious vilification, which has 24 produced some highly dispiriting outcomes in my home state, and had the effect of curtailing the individual's right to freedom of speech and expression - fundamental cornerstones of any democratic society. Another major highlight was the private briefing with the Congressional Research Service in Washington. This was particularly interesting from the point of view of an Australian legislator to see how the process in enacting legislation through the House and the Congress in the USA is so markedly different from our own processes and eventual passage of legislation. The USA's Committee system - what we in the Australian Parliament would know as our Backbench committees - is the most powerful form of enacting legislation. The membership of these committees - be they Standing or Rules committees - is decided upon by the House and the Senate, and essentially a 'rubber-stamp' of the party decision. In the end, the powerful Rules Committee eventually decides on the basis of its numbers, which Bills proceed for debate and passage in the Congress. I also observed and participated in the British election campaign and met with Conservative Party officials and representatives. In Greece, I met with a number of enterprising members of the local business community keen to forge stronger links with Australia, through tourism ventures, enhanced aeepss to export markets, and I met with the Chair of the Greece-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group, who, himself had visited Australia last year and whose visit to Parliament House I had the privilege of hosting. In each country, I met with the Australian Ambassadors, including outgoing Ambassador to the USA, Michael Thawley, newly-appointed High Commissioner to London, the Hon. Richard Alston, and Ambassador Paul Tighe in Greece. Conclusion: This was my first Study Tour undertaken as a Member of Parliament, and an experience that was thoroughly worthwhile in a personal, professional and political sense. I gained a greater understanding of the issues raised with leading thinkers in the USA, UK and Greece on matters of importance in my role as a Member of Parliament and as a legislator, and as representative of the electorate I serve. In the areas of taxation, welfare and labour market reform, bushfire mitigation and research, trade and strategic links with the countries I visited, I was impressed by the sophistication and insights of those with whom I met. Upon my return, lam strongly interested in exploring a number of these issues within our current political climate in Australia where I seek to examine the policy effectiveness of such approaches undertaken by overseas jurisdictions and what are any possible implications or policy lessons for Australian legislators. I understand that in accordance with Clause 9.5 of the Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 14 of 2003, this statement may be obtained from the Special Minister of State upon request by any member or senator. I also understand that this statement may be tabled in the Parliament at the discretion of the Special Minister of State. I understand that knowingly giving false or misleading information is a serious offence. Yours sincerely, SOPHIE PANOPOUWS MP FEDERAL MEMBER FOR INDI 3 June 2005 31, THE HON BRUCE BAUD MP 327 -J, AUSTRALIA BRUCE BAIRD MP FEDERAL MEMBER FOR COOK REPORT ON VISIT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA / CANADA APRIL 11TH - 22\" 2005 PREFACE My visit to the USA was predominantly aimed at discussions with economists, bankers, think tanks and congressmen regarding the US Economy, structural problems, the world economic outlook and the view of the Australian market from a US perspective. The general discussion points were related to the following issues: GOP GROWTH With the expected slowing of the economy, particularly in the housing, retail and employment sectors, GDP growth in the USA is expected to be about the 3% level. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has indicated his intention to progressively increase interest rates, which will have a slowing effect on the economy. There is no doubt that the rise in oil prices significantly affects the level of economic activity. CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT One of the big concerns for economists and politicians alike in the US is the size of the current account deficit. During the period of my study visit the figures were released for the current account deficit for the month of March, which was US$61 billion. Exports amounted to US$100 billion and imports US$161 billion. The response to this from economists and think tanks was varied but basically fell into 3 groups. I. This group which represented the majority felt that it was not a major problem. The view was that the US was the major economic engine of the world economy and the most significant consumer market. They argued that the US economy was likely to continue apace and that nothing would change in that the governments of China, Korea, Japan and Malaysia would continue to buy US dollar bonds which would pay for the deficit. 2. Some economists and some of the think tanks considered that the deficit was a major problem and would only be resolved by market forces which would see a continued slide in the value of the US dollar. However a contrary argument to this position is that with China's currency pegged to the US dollar, the benefit of a lower valuation of the dollars would not bring the benefits necessary to connect the strong imbalance. 3. A third (but very much a minority) view is that the current account deficit leaves the US economy vulnerable. If there is a shift away from investment in the US dollar, due to the strengthening of the Japanese and European economies, the results on the world economy would be significant. FISCAL DEFICIT The fiscal deficit in the US continues to grow exponentially. The combination of reduced tax rates, the continued war in Iraq, the war against terrorism, the increased price of oil, social security, Medicare and Medicaid, are all escalating the fiscal deficit. 3:) As was pointed Out by several economic commentators, the future outlook will only worsen without significant reforms. By 2030 it is estimated that the total cost of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security payments alone are expected to total 22% of GDP, while currently the total tax take is 15% of GDP. While George Bush received significant points with commentators for his work in terms of trade agreements, he was continually criticised for his performance with managing the economy. CONCERN WITH CHINA A very significant theme of the Congressmen whom 1 met with was their concern about China. The view by the congressmen was that China was seen as the main reason for America's expanding current account deficit. The year on year surplus with China for last year was US $170 billion. In fact, the US is one of the few countries with whom China has a surplus. The ending of the textiles quota at the beginning of this year has meant a flood of textile imports into the US. Congressmen said that they had received a large number of complaints from constituents concerned about the impact of Chinese imports on their businesses. 3 million manufacturing jobs have disappeared from the US economy and highlighted by the problems of General Motors and Ford. GENERAL MOTORS AND FORD Much concern was expressed by economists and commentators over the fiscal health of GM and Ford. General Motors announced a massive loss during the time 1 was in New York and economists predicted that General Motors bonds would be given junk bond status by Standard & Poor's (this has subsequently happened). It was considered that GM was in a worse position than Ford, but both face the same problems. The factors that bought about the current economic difficulties were seen as: \u00e2\u00a2 A decline in US market share due to strong competition from Asian markets and a perceived decline in product quality. \u00e2\u00a2 The unfunded liability for the superannuation and medical costs of former employees amounting to over $2000 per car sold, putting them at a further uncompetitive position. The implications for the US economy of the financial difficulties of these two corporate giants is significant. The prognosis was that General Motors would survive, but would be broken up into smaller divisions, with the finance arm being sold off. 31) SUMMERY OF APPOINTMENTS WASHINGTON DC Mr Geoff Gray Senior Trade Commissioner - Washington DC. Following negotiation of the FTA with the USA a commitment was made by the government to expand our trade resources in the US. This is currently being implemented. Much of the major opportunities with the FTA relate to Australia's access to US Government procurement. There will be a 6% increase in frontline staff from the current 12 to 17. There will 7 physical offices and 8 virtual offices. Mr Ian Wing Regional Trade Commissioner - The Americas. - Great opportunities are seen as a result of the FTA. - The awareness of the FTA is highest in Washington. - Opportunities in relation to above ground swimming pools and seafood Items. - Very positive attitude to Australia which needs to be exploited. - Enormous opportunities with potential gas deal in California - BHP Billiton, Woodside and Texaco. - If the LNG deals go through it will be bigger than the deal with China. Foreign Affairs - Washington DC. The US is becoming increasingly protectionist. China is again identified as a big issue. Some of the major issue being the currency linked to US dollar, intellectual property and the flood of textile imports from China. Treasury Representative - Washington DC. - Government revenue as share of GDP is down to the level of the late 50's. - $300 - $400 billion budget deficit, influenced by September 11th and Iraq \u00e2\u00a2 Very rapid increase in social security and health system expenditure - The US Treasury is not sure how it is going to reduce the deficit. - There has been a very rapid increase in social security and health costs. - Federal government collects 17% of GDP in taxes. By the year 2030 on current projection social security and health claims alone will cost $20% of GDP. There are obviously some very significant budget issues. - In relation to the current account deficit, there is no easy way out - 5% to 6% GDP. Alan Greenspan makes the point that this can be sustained. - Ac'i'ecs to global capital markets is much more fluid. - European demand is relatively weak. 331 - Most of Asia has a fixed exchange rate. -The US dollar will continue to decline and has dropped by 26% over the last 18 months. - If there is a real fall out, then there would be a strong effect on the Australian economy. Heritage Council Marc Miles, PhD. - What is happening in Central Europe is affecting the world economy; it is the incubator of the 21 ' century. -Slovakia is placing pressure on Germany particularly in relation to workplace relations and corporate taxation. - Deficit is clearly a result of a spending problem. - Unionisation in the USA is 13%, in Australia its 20%. -Chile experienced a 33% increase in two-way trade with the USA following the signing of the FTA. Department of Homeland Security - Citizenship & Immigration Services Joseph D. Cuddihy Offshore Processing of Asylum Seekers -The past year, there have been 52,000 refugees processed by the USA from various sources. -They had been a criticism of the US programme internally which in previous years had declined to 27,000\u2014 28,000 per year. After 9/I1 there was a scaling back of the numbers of refugees coming into the US. - The major criticism in the US regarding refugees is that the numbers are too low but also that they are the riskiest entrants because they often present no passports or documents. Refugee Processing - Those who present themselves at the airport and claim refugee status or are already in the country and claim refugee status. \u00e2\u00a2 Those who arrive at the airport with no documents or who have fraudulent documents will have expedited removal with no further entry into the US for 5 years. \u00e2\u00a2 However if the individual expresses fear for return, then they are then referred to asylum officers and their claims will be processed. They are given 48 hours before a review of their case is considered. -They are interviewed to determine whether their case has merit. If they don't meet the threshold, they can have an immigration judge review the case within 7 days. If the judge rejects their case, they can then be removed with no subsequent entry for 5 years. - If found to have a credible case, their case is put before an immigration judge. The judge can decide that the applicant can either be detained or released into the community. The majority (75% - 80%) are released into the community. The reasons that they are kept in detention is if it is determined that; - they lack community ties, or \u00e2\u00a2 they represent a threat to the community. - So far this year, 6,000 people have presented themselves as refugees at US airports. Within this group are 4,000 Cubans. After 1 year in the United States, Cubans are eligible for a green card and permanent residency. Very often they never appear before an immigration judge before receiving permanent residency. - The majority however are picked up within the country. There are many who come forward on a voluntary basis. In 1994, 28,000 people presented themselves to authorities. The majority are from China, Haiti, Mexico (special cases). - 30% are successful in their claims. -Small percentages do not turn up when their case is due. Their case has to be approved in order to go to the judge. - When unsuccessful, the documents for removal proceedings are put before the judge. The judge makes the decision and the government can appeal. Of those who turned up for the hearing, 44% were granted asylum status. Detention -This comes under the responsibility of the Office of Homeland Security. - If the individual on arrival at the airport has fraudulent or no documents but claims fear of being returned, they are sent to the closest detention centre. -They are interviewed after 48 hours and are given access to representation to determine whether there are grounds for a refugee claimant case. 90% of cases make the threshold to go before the judge. -They can be held in detention or released. In fact, most are released. -The time taken before claimants appear before a judge is 30-60 days. A hearing is usually held within 45 days and a decision Within 180 days. -Those individuals who file an application in defensive asylum processing are subject to detention, but the numbers detained are smaller still. Most have ties and are less of a flight risk. During the time their case is being processed, they have no work rights. These cases do not move as fast as those detained. If their case is longer than 180 days, then they are given work rights. Prior to 1985, there were automatic work rights. Congressional Budget Office Melissa Merson -Every January the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) produces an economic outlook. It was not a forecast of reality. - The CBO outlook and the Presidents outlook is not very different. \u00e2\u00a2 During the course of the year there is a review of, \u00e2\u00a2 mandatory spending (entitlement) \u00e2\u00a2 discretionary spending (non-entitlement) \u00e2\u00a2 revenue 333 - Medicare, Medicaid, social security and non-discretionary spending - the only way they can constrict spending in this area is to change the underlying law. -Cost of Medicare has risen exponentially (2\" year of changes Sl-2 trillion). Congressman Todd Russell Plafts 19\" District PA - Involved in assessment of government programmes. - Agencies have to be audited by outside auditor. - Discovered government errors totalling $40 billion, $22 billion in Medicare alone. - Programme assessment rating tool used by the Office of Management and Budget this was implemented. It was found that in 20% of the cases the results were not demonstrated by the programme. -Programme Assessment and Results Act - It doesn't say in what manner the programme can be assessed. Once every 5 years the programme will be reviewed. -The committee has a membership of 45. - The programme is heavily weighted to results of management programmes. Cato Institute Daniel T Griswold Current Account Deficit - Current account deficit mirrors capital surplus. - Macro economic fundamentals that a current account deficit is an indicator of good things going on. -For example: Germany has a $200 billion trade surplus but they have a 12.6% unemployment rate. Germany has a stagnate domestic economy. Germany is not confident to consume, fearful and risk averse. China -The US Senate refuses to kill the 27Y2% tariff imposition bill on Chinese goods unless they float their currency. -3 million less jobs in manufacturing than in the 2001 peak. - However the manufacturing exports which have been hardest hit are aeronautics and high technology products. - US business community are very strongly pro-China. China is in fact the world's number 3 importer. China is also soaking up global steel. -There are concerns regarding textiles, imports, intellectual property and WFO reforms. -The current account deficit amounts to 5%-6% of GDP, however trade deficit is governed by market force. - Economies are more deregulated, more global - this gives confirmation that changes are relatively slow. - Greenspan is less sanguine and is trying to dampen demand. The Cato Institute is critical of Bush as the biggest spending President since Lyndon Johnson. 334 - According to the Cato Institute, Bush in his first term had no discipline on Congress. Spending has gone up due to the War on Terrorism and Iraq. The view of the Cato Institute is that the Republican party has not been fiscally responsible. - Cato are big champions for moving social security to private accounts. Major challenge is the replacement for Alan Greenspan. -The problem of ensuring Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) passes Congress - there are strong labour and environmental concerns. - Cato believes Congress should stand up to the sugar lobby and that Congress need to take away agricultural subsidies - Australia seen as doing the right thing. In the USA, sugar is 3 times the global price. The fact that the US have completed their FTA with Australia takes sugar off the radar screen. Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation David Palmer - Australian exports of meat to the USA totals $1.4 billion. $300 million in lamb. This amounts to 378 thousand tonnes of meat. -The US/Australia FTA results in an increase of 70,000 tonnes. The quota rises to 448 million tonnes of meat - more than double any other nation's quota. -The North American Office covers Mexico, USA & Canada. -Australia put 1000 tons of meat per day into the market. 90% is ground up and blended with US beef fat. 78% lean - 22% fat into hamburgers. -The key markets for Australians are: 1. Hamburgers 2. Pastrami items 3. Chilled beef of high quality, this amounts to 27,000\u2014 30,000 tons -Japan is buying most of the high quality meat cuts. -S3.2mi11ion of lamb goes into the marketing of lamb in the US. -Australian lamb has 30% share of the US market - The US per capita consumption of lamb is \u00bd kilo per person per year. Australia has consumption of around 12-13 kilo's per person per year. -The US lamb market represents 28% of lamb exports and 41% of the total value of lamb exports. - Australia needs to look particularly at potential competition for beef from South America, - Brazil and Uruguay. -Americans consume 550 million pounds of beef per week (250,000 tons). - Traditional lamb eaters within the US are Caucasian, earn on average $70,000 per year and are educated (40 million people).. -The USA represents a $1 trillion per year food market. Representative Frank Wolf, 10tb District, Virginia -Chairman of the Human Rights Committee. -Concerned particularly with Sudan, Albania, China and Tibet. -The Human Rights Committee is a voluntary committee rather than a Joint Standing Committee. 315 Institute for International Affairs - Vote on CAFTA (Central American Free Trade Agreement) will be close. - They view the Chinese as not sophisticated in the way that they handled the end of the multi-fibre arrangement quotas. Now the Chinese can ship as much as they want. The Institute believes that China should have held back on exports in a more restrained way. -Chinese bilateral trade deficit with the US is $160 million per year. - Because of the size of the domestic deficit, the Institute sees it as imperative for China to cut agricultural subsidies. The deficit at 2.3% of GDP doesn't look so bad, but starting in 2010 there will be an inexorable drift upwards in the cost of Medicaid ($50 billion). - Current deficit is $500 billion. - Health is 9%-10% of GDP which will go up to 14%. - In relation to the current account deficit, the institute believes that the dollar will go lower. -The institute sees at some stage the Australian dollar at panty with the United States dollar. - The institute mentioned a number of issues in relation to China. I. Oil Issue - China's policy is one of trying to nail down sources of supply in Sudan, Iran and Venezuela. 2. Taiwan. 3. Areas of cooperation with North Korea. 4. It is unlikely for the US to have a warm relationship with China. 5. Big industry in China is very much against floating of the currency. CANADA - Ottawa Michael Borren - Immigration Lawyer, Former Canadian President of Amnesty International - Asylum seekers who have been accepted elsewhere are not allowed to make a further application in Canada. -On arrival in Canada asylum seekers are immediately photographed and finger printed. Applicants are not detained unless: \u00e2\u00a2 They are a danger to the community \u00e2\u00a2 They have failed to establish their identity -There is not a high rate of absconding. - Recently Canada entered into an agreement with the USA. Asylum seekers from the US will be turned back to have their claim processed in the USA. The only exception to this case are those who have family in Canada. -There is concern about procedures in the US as there is a much higher degree of detention. - In the Senate in the US they determined that they will not return any asylum seekers to face deportation in their country of asylum. - In Canada, the initial cases have to be completed within 28 days. The cases go to a quasi-judicial hearing. -Time for processing used to be 14 months. During that time applicants are in the community and they have rights to work, welfare and children can go to school. This time has shortened but it depends on the city in which the application is made. - The acceptance rate is 40-50%. - If the case fails, there are options available; \u00e2\u00a2 They can have the case reviewed by the federal court (10,000 applications were referred last year).

In order for the case to be heard, they have to get leave of the court. \u00e2\u00a2 Only 10-15% of cases are given the right of appeal. \u00e2\u00a2 Of these those that get leave, 50% gain approval. - Every failed refugee claimant is entitled to a pre-removal assessment. The acceptance rate is 2%. The best chance is when something has happened in the country of ongrn, The number of asylum claims is going down. - While it is commonly thought that terrorists come into the country as refugee applicants, the reality is that none of the 9-I1 terrorists came in under any refugee claims.

Success rate is 50% of those who appear before the court. However, the overall success rate is as low as 5% for those taking their case to court. - Humanitarian and compassionate grounds - special cases - i.e. dialysis, children involved, etc, are considered separately. - The change in 2002 was the most fundamental change. \u00e2\u00a2 Repeat claims for refugee status were deemed not eligible. \u00e2\u00a2 They do detain if there is a risk of flight or if the identity of the claimant has not been determined. \u00e2\u00a2 8,000 -10,000 people are detained; most of them are resolved in less than 10 days. \u00e2\u00a2 Every 30 days the case is reviewed by the IRB. \u00e2\u00a2 There is only 5 cases which are over 4/5 years old. \u00e2\u00a2 All claimants are fingerprinted immediately.

The focus of these meetings was to gain a general overview of the economic situation in both the United Kingdom and the United States and a perspective on the prospects for world economic growth and trends in international trade and interest rates. In Britain discussions were held regarding the 'golden rule', the UK government's fiscal policy which includes, amongst other things, separation of the recurrent and capital sides of the Budget. A key focus of meetings was to determine how the Blair Government was handling infrastructure issues, financing and the relationship to its fiscal objectives. In Britain there is at least $42 billion worth of projects currently either on the drawing board or underway where private money is building public hospitals and schools and investing in roads and other transport devices. Extensive evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of such projects were outlined by those experienced in the field. The focus of appointments in the United States was US fiscal policy and the international economic outlook, trade relationships between the US and China, the US trade deficit, international currency movements, and their likely impact on the Australian economy. Meetings were held with representatives of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Congressional Budget Office. These discussions centred on the challenges facing international economic policy including the emergence and impact of Asian economic powers, the restructuring of international trade and capital flows, and redistribution of the international economic power. A meeting with The Committee for a Responsible Budget covered trends in US fiscal policy. These issues were also covered during meetings with a number of private sector firms with Australian interests. I also met with Thomas Mann, the W Averell Harriman Chair and Senior Fellow in Gover,rance Studies at the Brookings Institute, Wayne Swan MP Shadow Treasurer MRS KAY ELSON MP Malaysia, Czech Republic, Austria and Poland lo Apr -7 May 05 Report not received at time of preparation of this document.

To inspect the Gallipoli battlefield Site and to inquire as to future plans the Turkish Government may have for Anzac Cove. 2. 1 also sought to gain a greater understanding of the challenges that face our long standing relationship with Turkey as a significant country with whom Australia has very strong historic links: to understand the current progress and prospects of Turkey entering into the EU; and to better understand the historic heritage of ancient Turkey and its present culture and society, and how we can forge closer ties for our common future, especially amongst the younger generations of both nations. \u00a3b) I'HNERARY Flight Details: Sydney to Bahrain - GFl49 Sunday 17th April, 2005 Bahrain to Istanbul -QF043 Monday 18 th April,2005 Istanbul to Ankara - TKI 16 Saturday 30th April, 2005 Shop I, 9-15 East Parade, Sutherland Fax: (02) 6273 4140 DAN NA 0,ie Of 2 Ankara to Istanbul - 1K 123 Monday 2\" May, 2005 Istanbul to Bahrain - GF044 Monday 2\u00b0\" May 2005 Bahrain to Sydney - GFI48 Tuesday 3' May, 2005 Daily Itinerary: MONDAY 18\"APRIL 2005 Arrived Istanbul Ataturk Airport and met by Consul-General Damian Fisher and AustraLle Liaison Officer Duck Guven, who facilitated our arrival and transferred us to our hotel. Seven Hills Hotel, Sultanahmet, Istanbul 34400 This boutique 3-star hotel in the Sultanahmet is located in one of the ancient parts of the city. Close by is the Blue Mosque, Santa Sophia and the Topkapi Palace. Neat cobblestone streets lead down to the Bospherus, and along the way carpet shops and ceramicware dealers display their wares. The ancient Hippodrome, a reminder of the city's Roman past, is within a stroll around the corner at the rear of the hotel. The open upper terraces of this small hotel afford the excellent views of the Bosphorus.and its heavy maritime traffic. Visited the Kumkapi, a traditional restaurant area specializing in seafood and close to the Fish Markets. We joined many other Australian visitors in Istanbul and enjoyed some great Turkish seafood prepared in their unique traditional way. TUESDAY 19\"APRIL 2005 Meeting with Consul General Damian Fisher at the offices of the Consulate in Istanbul. WEDNESDAY 20T \" APRIL 2005 Met Mr. AKIN SEI-IAP, Managing Director, Ekol Travel Ltd. Ishakpasa 34400, The Divan Otel, at Isletniesi, Istanbul. VISIT TO THE TURKISH NAVAL MUSEUM: Met by Austrade Liaison Officer Dilek Guven and attended at the Naval Museum. We were greeted by the Administrator, Colonel Bulent Aksaray (Rtd.) and Senior Guide Oznur Kocaoglu. Profile: Turkish maritime history dates from an amazing 1319. Museum contains many significant oil paintings of naval engagements, many models of famous Turkish military vessels which were built by retired naval veterans. Amazingly, these veterans also undertake fundraising to contribute to the purchase of new naval vessels for the Turkish Navy. There appears to be a very strong commitment by retired Turkish seamen in maintaining their links with current serving members. National Service is mandatory in Turkey, usually for a period of around 12months. The bonds amongst the \"old salts\" with current naval personnel appeared to be very strong. 3(3 3 The Museum also contained several excellent examples of Ottoman caiques, complete with gold embellishments on the prow, velvet cushions, canopies and gold tassels festooned the royal quarters at the rear of these long, elegant rowing vessels. Two small, simply crafted wooden row-boats by which Ataturk enjoyed boating on the broad Bosphosus provided a subtle, silent testimony in contrast of style and character between the Turkey of the Ottomans and that of Ataturk. THURSDAY 21ST APRIL 2005 Walked around the old cobbled streets of the Sutanahmet and met and spoke with many of the local people. Again found the children very engaging, and very interested in speaking to us in their school English Those that I asked were all enthusiastic about seeing a kangaroo. Transferred to Grand Anka Hotel, Molla Curani Cad. No. 46, Findikzaade. Istanbul, At 630pm, we joined a large party of about 70 Australians and New Zealanders for an evening cruise on the historic Bosphorus. Its colourful foreshores revealed palaces of past emperors and ancient mosques amongst the mansions and gardens, all successfully holding back the city high-rise from the waterway. Met several Australian and New Zealand veterans and their wives in Turkey for the Anzac commemorations, including Mr. D'Arcy Bailey, executive member of the NZRSA, and secretary of the Whangarie Veterans Association. FRIDAY 22\" APRIL 2005 HISTORIC TOUR: We began our tour of historic Turkey with a visit and briefing on the Topkapi Palace. Built on one of the seven hills of Istanbul, this huge palace complex commands a strategic site with excellent views over the Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn Inlet. The Palace complex was the seat of government for the Ottoman Empire for many centuries, and at its height, catered for over 4000 people on site. We visited and were briefed on the Blue Mosque, known for its remarkable blue ceramic tiles This mosque is still in use by local Moslems. We visited and were briefed on the Hippodrome and its history, including the tall granite Egyptian oblisk, which dates back 3,000years. It's erection within the Hippodrome is a story in itself. We visited and were briefed on the Grand Bazaar, one of the oldest market centres in Turkey. Comprising 4000 shops, the exotic and mysterious Covered Banar, as it is also known, reflects the ancient trading customs of the Middle East. I soon learnt that bargaining can be an enjoyable art form for the persistent, and is very much part of the social fabric of Turkey. Attended at the official reception hosted by Ambassador Jean Dunn and Consul-General Damian Fisher - Opening of an Exhibition of Australian Indigenous Art at the Illayda Sanat Gallery in Istanbul. 4 SATURDAY 23 d APRIL 2005 The private historic tour departed Istanbul and we drove by coach to the Gallipoli Peninsula for an inspection of the battlefields. Briefed on the battlefields and visited the Anzac Cove, Lone Pine Australian Memorial and Cemetery, the original tunnels and trenches at Johnston's Jolly. The Nek Cemetery, Chunuk-Bair New Zealand Memorial and Cemetery, and Kabatepe War Museum. After inspection of the battlefields, we drove to Assos for overnight accommodation SUNDAY 24 \" APRIL 2005 Briefed and toured the ancient Greek citadel town of Assos, and it's magnificent acropolis overlooking the vast misty reaches of the Aegean. Ancient Assos had been settled in the bronze-age and has been inhabited ever since. From atop the ruins of the acropolis, one could see the shadow of the island of Lesbos through the mists on the far eastern horizon. The view of the landscape swung a spectacular 360degrees around the acropolis. One could feel the soft Aegean breezes, and hear the majestic silence. No wonder Aristotle, and those who would be great thinkers and philosophers who followed thereafter, came to this place to seek inspiration. All they had to do was climb the hill, breathe the air, and drink in the view.. Drove to Canakkale to the Kolin Hotel and met by Liaison Officer Tristy Falkenberg. 19.00pm Joined the very large crowd of international representatives and veterans at the official Anzac Evening Reception at the Kolin Hotel hosted by HE Governor Kanci of Canakkali. Included amongst the distinguished company was the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. John Howard and Mrs. Howard; HRH Charles, the Prince of Wales; the Prime Minister of New Z ealand Helen Clarke, and the Prime Minister of Turkey, HE Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Mrs. Erdogan. Many senior Defence officers from many nations were also in attendance, including General Peter Cosgrove and Admiral Chris. Ritchie from Australia. MONDAY 25 APRIL 2005 230am Left Kolin Hotel Canakkale for the Dawn Service at Anzac Cove. 700am Arrived at the Kum Hotel for breakfast hosted by the New Zealand Government. 1000am Arrived at Lone Pine, Australian Memorial and Cemetery for official ceremony. With about nine other members of Parliament, it was a privilege to have been able to lay a wreath at Lone Pine 1130am. Attended at Turkish 57 th Regiment Ceremony 1230pm Attended Australian BBQ Lunch hosted by the Prime Minister at the Commonwealth War Graves Cottage on the Peninsula. Also in attendance were members of the crew of HMAS ANZAC, in the Dardenelles for the commemorations and three members of the Australian Parliament (Hon. Bronwyn Bishop, Member for McKeller; Senator Santo Santoro and Mark Baker, Member for Braddon) as part of the Australian Parliament Defence Program who were on board the Anzac for ten days as part of that program. Met Air Vice Marshall Gary Beck, Director of Australian War Graves. 7.00 Returned to the Kolin Hotel with official party. TUESDAY 26 T \" APRIL 2005 365 5 After breakfast, we drove to Troy to rejoin the historic tour group. Troy is the site of King Priam's Treasures. Probably the most famous city of ancient times, almost every school student knows the story of the Trojan Horse. Troy is in fact nine cities built on top of each other. Troy VI is believed to be that of the Trojan War of Homer, where the legendary heroes included Agamemnon, Achilles, Ulysses and Nestor on the Greek side, and Priam, Hector and Paris on the Trojan side. From Troy, we drove to Kusadasi for overnight accommodation and dinner. WESDNESDAY 27 APRIL 2005 Briefing and inspection of Ephesus, undoubtedly one of the most important cultural Centres of the ancient world. Impressive structures still standing include the Library of Celsus, the Temple of Hadrian, the Theatre Odeon and the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. We also visited a local handcrafts farm, a government-sponsored carpet showroom designed to preserve this unique traditional skill amongst the women of Turkey We were shown how silk is sourced from the silkworms and spun by an ancient foot-pedalled hand-controlled single spinning loom. Several young women were busy weaving large carpets and were happy to demonstrate how it is done. THURSDAY 28 ' APRIL 2005 Departed for Pamukkale with its amazing white calcium rock formations and thermal water springs. This area was once the famous beauty and health centre for Queen Cleopatra. FRIDAY 29 ' APRIL 2005 Departed for Istanbul through many regional country areas and cities of Turkey. Overnight in Istanbul. SATURDAY 30 th APRIL 2005 Arrived at Ankara Airport and met by Embassy Liaison Officer Pembe Aktar and Ceyhun Gercek. We walked the old parts of Ankara around Ulus, (the old town), including the old shopping centres and the vibrant Copper Alley. Close by is the Citadel, the foundations of which were laid by the Galations on a prominent lava outcrop. The work was completed by the Romans and further additions were subsequently made by the Byzantines and the Seljuk Turks This area contains fine examples of traditional architecture and is a very popular place for locals and visitors alike. SUNDAY l t MAY 2005 Businesses, shops and museums open late on Sundays in Ankara, so, in the excellent company of Pembe Aktar, Embassy Liaison Officer, we began with brunch at the very popular Kuki House, 6 and at the same time, watched a small cooking class led by one of the senior chefs of the restaurant preparing traditional Turkish deserts. At last, we arrived at the renowned Museum of Anatolian Civilizations and were privileged to have been able to spend the best part of the afternoon inspecting the exhibits. This old bedesten (covered bazaar), tastefully restored, now houses an edifying collection of Paleolithic, Neolithic, artefacts and showpiece Lydian treasures. In 1997, this fine Museum won an international award for excellence in its category , and continues to receive world-wide academic acclaim. 13,000 years of human history is reflected in this marvellous museum, and indeed, it was one of the reasons I wished to visit Ankara. This Museum traces the ascent of man, and the development of civilizations. Indeed, it traces the nascent stirring of the indomitable spirit of man, and his movement towards that which we call civilization. This is indeed a very ancient land, with many ancient customs. Turkey is fiercely proud of its past, and one senses there remains a lot of ancient Turkey in its contemporary counterpart, together with a vibrancy and a yearning to embrace the technology, the political and the modern of whatever the twenty-first century has to offer. The Museum was established at the request of Ataturk himself, who arranged for the historic bedesten to be restored especially for the purpose. We were guided through the Museum by an official guide, Mr. Naci OzWrk, who was a retired Turkish Army pilot. It appears that Turkey has a policy of employing retired defence officers where it is possible to do so. Mr. Ozturk also explained that while he received a veteran's pension, he loved the work and he loved to share the history of Turkey with international visitors. MONDAY 2' MAY 2005 Left Ankara Airport at 1100 hours for Istanbul (Flight TK123)and the return journey home. We were met at Istanbul Airport by Austrade Liaison Officer Dilet Guven and were facilitated through customs and the VIP departure area. We boarded Gulf Air Flight 0F44 to Bahrain and arrived thereat approximately 1845hour5. Transferred to Gulf Air GF148 to Sydney via Singapore and arrived at Sydney Airport very close to ETA 2015 hours on Tuesday 3 May, 2005. (ii) Key .neet1n25 and outcomes Note: Our embassy in Ankara was unable to arrange meetings for me with representatives of the Turkish Government due to their busy schedules during the commemoration week, and the lateness of my decision to visit Turkey. However, besides briefings with our Consul-General in Istanbul, and meetings with our Ambassador, I was also able to meet with academics and several local businessmen who had dealings with Australians and Australian businesses and who were keen to foster future relationships. MONDAY 18th APRIL 2005 367 7 Met local businessman Mr. Oktay Ayten, Genera] Manager of the Seven Hills Hotel, and his brother, Mr. Daran Ayten, Both are business-partners in the carpet sho wroom located within the lower hotel area Mr. Oktay Atyen is married to an Australian and they have two children. The children attend the International School in Istanbul because Mr. and Mrs. Ayten intend to continue returning to Australia from time to time (because of f amily and business interests) and believe the children will find school in Australia easier if they receive their current education in English at the International School Mr. & Mrs. Ayten have strong relationships with Australia, enjoy welcoming Australians to their hotel, and are great advocates for Australia and Australians amongst the business community in their local area, Met Mr. hiy Kocabiyik, historian, translator (English and German) who was our guide for our time in Turkey. Mr. Kocabiyik told me there were no kangaroos in Turkey and that Turkish children would love to see kangaroos. This seemed to be a fine suggestion to help nurture our relationships with the youngest generation in Turkey and I promised to inquire into the possibility of arranging for some kangaroos to be sent to the zoos in Istanbul and Ankara for the children of Turkey. TUESDAY 19th APRIL 2005 Formal meeting with Consul General Damian Fisher at the offices of the Consulate in Istanbul. I received a briefing on matters relating to Turkey's economic and political situation; Australia's special relationship with Turkey and our shared interest in the Gallipoli peninsular, the current situation regarding the roadworks, and the respect and regard we each hold for our veterans. Profile of Turkey: \u00e2\u00a2 Turkey is literally a land bridge between East and West; between Europe and Asia. It is located in an earthquake zone. \u00e2\u00a2 It borders eight countries (in the EU, Middle East and Central Asian republics) \u00e2\u00a2 It is a unique secular Moslem State \u00e2\u00a2 It has a population 69,603,927 and still growing. Turkey is expected to have the largest population in Europe by 2014. 50% of population is under 25year5 of age. \u00e2\u00a2 Turkey is the second largest member of NATO \u00e2\u00a2 In the Customs Union with EU since 1996 \u00e2\u00a2 In October 2005, EU leaders expected to begin negotiations re Turkey's application to join EU. 50% of Turkey's exports already go to the EU. \u00e2\u00a2 It is a market-driven economy in transition, on the threshold of modernisation \u00e2\u00a2 Turkey has a huge underdeveloped rural sector and has suffered huge economic meltdown, with inflation around 9% and significant unemployment \u00e2\u00a2 The prospect of becoming a member of the EU is driving improvements (eg laws, better relations with neighbours, especially Greece and Cyprus. \u00e2\u00a2 Turkey holds 11 \"' place in the world for the number of its students that are seeking an education abroad There is huge competition in Turkey for tertiary places only I in 5 obtain a place at a Turkish university. As many as 40,000 students leave Turkey annually to study abroad. However, probably because of our distance from Turkey, Australia receives around only 500 of these students annually. English language studies is a priority with the students. (Many young people came up to speak to us Ths 8 wherever we were in Turkey. They wanted to practice their English and were very interested that we were Australians and asked many questions about our country.) Turkey's future outlook is positive. The government under the present Prime Minister is stable and the recent municipal elections have increased that stability The government is undertaking reforms in liberalizing and restructuring the economy. These include: Human rights Privatization Legislative reforms Reduction in the bureaucracy Banking sector reforms Inflation management Strict fiscal policy management Turkey has opportunities in: Retailing Telecommunications Energy and Utilities Education and Training Healthcare Services Regarding the Gallipoli Peninsula, Mr. Fisher pointed out that this area was sacred to the Turkish people as well as Australians and New Zealanders. Indeed, there were around eighty thousand Turkish soldiers killed in the fighting on the peninsular. The l8 March is commemorated as the Battle of Canakkale. The Turkish Government were quite sensitive to the Australian concerns (especially sensational newspaper reports) regarding the upgrading of the roadway near Anzac Cove. However, even though we did suggest the upgrading of the roads at Chanuk Bane and Lone Pine for safety reasons, ultimately Gallipoli Peninsula is Turkish sovereign soil, and they did win. It should also be remembered that the Turkish people have been gallant and very generous hosts in allowing Australians and New Zealanders to continue to \"invade\" their country in increasing thousands every year. WEDNESDAY 20' hAPRIL 2005 Met Mr. Akin Sehap of Ekol Travel Ltd. Mr. Sehap is the Turkish business partner of one of my constituents, Mr. Dennis Weatherall of Aliways Travel Pty. Ltd, Sydney. Mr. Sehap's company assists over 400,000 Australians travelling in Turkey. Greece and the Middle East every year and is keen to strengthen his business and social ties with Australia. He expressed his wish to establish a Turkish/Australian Business Forum in Istanbul to facilitate business with Australia and to establish links with the Australian/Turkish Association here in Australia. To assist him in this regard, I arranged for Mr. Sehap to receive an invitation to a reception in Istanbul hosted by our Ambassador Ms. Jean Dunn and the Consul General to launch an exhibition of Indigenous Australian Art by Cicada Trading Pty. Ltd. FRIDAY 22 APRIL 2005 369 9 Met: Mr. Halim Zeyzi, Chairman of the Board, American Business Forum in Turkey, affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Ms. Anne Speed, Cicada Trading Ply. Ltd., Australian Indigenous An Mr. Omit Orgloglu, organiser of The Legends Tennis Championship, Istanbul/Australia Mr. Pat Cash, Australian tennis Champion Mr. Nadir Onuc, Motif collection, (Old Turkish carpets and embroideries) Mr. Turan Bozkurt, (cashmere and silk merchant) I introduced Mr. Akin Sehap to many of the business community present at the Exhibition, many of whom had links with Australia. I understand from information received from Mr. Sehap upon my return to Australia, that he has since held a formal meeting with several members of the local Turkish business community who are interested in establishing a Turkish/Australian Business Forum to develop plans to reinforce relationships. I also advised Mr. Sehap I would be happy to assist wherever possible in this regard. MONDAY 25th APRIL 2005 DAWN SERVICE - GALLIPOLI: With the VIP party we arrived in the darkness accompanied, as expected, by a chill wind blowing in from the Aegean We melted into the gathered throng at the Anzac Cove commemoration site, rubbing elbows with the many thousands of Australians, New Zealanders, Turkish, British and many others waiting patiently and well-rugged, under a cold, cloudless mghtsky. Anchored close-by, riding a calm swell, was HAAS Anzac, festooned in lights. The Director of the Australian War Grave Commission stepped to the microphone and a hush immediately fell over the large crowd. During the course of the commemoration service, an estimated 20,000 or so pilgrims, most of them young Australians, maintained a respectful, silent watch under the distant stars. In mute understanding that we were privileged to be hereon this hallowed ground, this legendary place that has stirred our hearts and imaginations since childhood, we waited and watched. Gallipoli! We are here. The ceremony had begun. It takes the daylight to deliver the powerful reality of the land of the Gallipoli legend where 8,709 young Anzacs died. The size of the narrow beach: how did those 25,000 Australians and New Zealanders ever land here with all their stores and equipment and guns? The height and proximity of the steep cliff-face: bow did they assault that slope, tiring and slipping and climbing? How did they survive as well as they did in such forbidden terrain, virtually throwing themselves at the enemy and the bullets, while looking out for a mate. How did they last on that god-forsaken beach-head, standing and fighting for months until the order came to leave? However did they do it, and at the same time, establish the values that continue to shape the Australian psyche: Aussies never give up; Aussies always look after their mates.... The huge arc-lights shone and lit up the cliff tops and held for several moments on \"the sphinx\" before finally surrendering to the mournful strains of the Last Post. The new day hung in rising diaphanous mists in the eastern sky and slowly revealed a limpid Aegean. 20,000 souls held their breath. The soft morning glowed, and lit the watery wafts with the promise of an Anzac sunrise...... 3 7u 10 If you look very closely through the dawn, you can just make out the shapes of landing barges grinding in the sand in the shallows. If you are very still, you can see the men, the brave young men, piling out, spilling out, into the sea, some to disappear forever. If you can quieten your heartbeat, you can hear the deathly sounds of gunfire exploding all around. Holding still, very still, see deeply into the mist, the shapes of many barges, fully laden. They keep coming. More and more men. And you might catch, between heartbeats, the shouts and the sounds of men calling and dying, firing their rifles, calling and dying. In an awesome fragment of time, between the long, low rays of the rising sun, you might glimpse the flash of bright eyes and gum faces of boys. Our boys. The last bugle note holds, then fades The beach is empty. Our boys are gone. The only sound is the wind. Later, walking amongst the gravestones, you find their names.... with a loving, longing, message from home. Somehow, \"thank you\" is not quite enough. SATURDAY 3o APRIL 2005 Husband Bob and I attended at a dinner hosted by Australian Ambassador Ms. Jean Dunn and her husband Mr. Brian Dunn. We met other guests, Colonel and Mrs. Clive Hodges, the new British Defence and Military Attache to Turkey; Marielle Sander-Linstrom, Chief of Mission of the International Organisation for Migration; and Prof Dr. A. Mete Tuncoku, Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University, Faculty of Education Dr. Toncoku has visited Australia many times, and has worked at the Australian War Memorial for three months and spoke very highly of the opportunity and was keen to see further opportunities for academics in Turkey to study our shared history. Dr. Toncoku is a recognized historian and authority on Gallipoli. From Ms. Sander-Linstrom, I learnt that as Turkey has weak immigration laws (visas can literally be purchased via a vending machine at the airport) it has become a destination for people-traffickers. The concern is the many people, guestimated to be in the thousands, who are working in Turkey in nothing less than slavery. Their papers are taken from them, and they are forced to work wherever and at what ever they are told to do by the traffickers. This includes prostitution. Ms. Sander-Linstrom congratulated Australia on our strong immigration regime, which she said protects us from the kind of trade in human beings that is known to exist in Turkey. Her role is to work with the international agencies to help prevent this human tragedy. jiii) Conclusions Broadly, two main objectives in my study tour of Turkey was (i) to be personally involved in the commemoration of the 90'hanniversary of the landing at Anzac Cove and (ii) to investigate measures by which we might reinforce our unique relationship with Turkey, especially for the next generation. Following the meetings and briefings already noted above, and many informal conversations with ordinary Turkish people (shop-keepers, hotel staff, students, eta) I make the following suggestions for the Governments consideration by which Australia may reinforce our unique relationship with the people of Turkey. 371 11 I Kangaroos for the zoos in Istanbul and Ankara Every Turkish child and young person to whom I spoke said they had never seen a live kangaroo and would love to do so. Follow up: I will send a personal representation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to inquire if such a suggestion is possible and appropriate and to seek guidance on how kangaroos may be delivered. 2. Turkish high-school students from the Gallipoli region be invited to Australia for Anzac commemorations in April each year. Several Australian high-school students attend the Dawn Service at Gallipoli each year. Some are supported by the RSL or other veterans associations, some are sponsored by the States via essay, art or drama competitions. I suggest that four high-school students from the Canakkale, Ecabat or Galhbolu areas be selected by the local governor to visit Australia for 213weeks each April. It is possible the Turkish Ambassador in Australia would be able to facilitate accommodation for the students and chaperons, and Australia could pay for the travel costs. Two students could attend the Anzac ceremonies in Melbourne and two in Sydney, as these cities hold the largest populations of Turkish-Australians Visits such as this would assist facilitate relationships between the young people from that special region of Turkey where the Anzac story is well-known Many of the current young people of this region would be descendents of Turkish veterans of the battle. FOLLOW-UP: To write to the Minister for Veteran Affairs with this suggestion- 3. A feasibility study for the erection of a large suspension bridge over the Dardenells between Canakkale and Ecabat, to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the landing at Anzac Cove in 2015 as a gift from the people of Australia to the people of Turkey. Like the bridge that Australia built over the Mekong for the people of Vietnam in the early 1990's, this bridge could also be called \"The Friendship Bridge\". FOLLOW-UP: To write to the Prime Minister regarding the \"Friendship Bridge\" as a worthy gift from Australia to the people of Turkey commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Landing 2015. 4. To establish a Gallipoli Memorial Park in Australia that replicates, as closely as possible, the Gallipoli battlefields and memorials for the many thousands of Australians, especially children, and many of our senior citizens, and for those who are unable to travel to Turkey. The area around Point Nepean on the Momington Peninsula in Victoria closely resembles the Gallipoli Peninsula and could provide an excellent setting in which to build our own Gallipoli Memorial Park. The Director of the Australian War Graves Commission has an intimate knowledge of the Gallipoli Memorial Park in Turkey, is highly experienced in building unique memorials (eg The Australian Memorial in Hyde Park in London, Isarava on the Kokoda Track in PNG and the new Australian Commemoration site at 12 Anzac Cove) and would be able to give valuable insight into such a project of national interest. Such a Park would not only be the focus of commemoration services, but would offer valuable opportunities for education, tourism, recreational and theatrical activities, possibly even re-enactments as at Gettysburg in the USA. The site in question is owned by the Victorian Government I had the opportunity of speaking personally to Mr. Steve Bracks, the Premier of Victoria at Canakkale during the visit. Re was very interested in the concept and asked me to write to him on my return- FOLLOW-UP ' Victoria write to Mr. Steve Bracks, Premier of Victoa and confirm our conversation regarding a replica Gallipoli Memorial Park for Australia at Point Nepean. 5. To assist Mi. Akin Sehap and the Turkish Australian Business Forum in contacting the Australian-Turkish Association here in Australia for the mutual benefit of the businessmen and women of both nations. FOLLOW-UP: To maintain communication with Mr. Schap and the Turkish/Australian Business Forum and assist in contacts with the Australian Turkish Association for the mutual benefit of both nations. 6. To contact and encourage local Australian wine merchants known to me to contact our Consul-General in Istanbul, Mr. Damian Fisher with a view to facilitate the importation into Turkey of Australian wine FOLLOW-UP: I have already spoken to Mr. Stephen Wilkinson of Sydney, whose company exports Australian wine into China. He expressed a strong interest in exporting to Turkey I will be meeting with Mr. Wilkinson shortly in this regard. I have already given him our Consul-General's contact details in Istanbul. Conclusion: The knowledge gained on my study tour of Turkey will enable me to relate with greater understanding and assist in creating productive working relationships with Turkish Members of Parliament, members of the Turkish diplomatic corps and Embassy officials when we meet on future business and social occasions in Australia. In recent years as a Member of the Australian Parliament,! have been fortunate to meet Mr.Bulent Anne, Speaker of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, and Mr. Engin Turker, Ambassador and Senior Advisor to the Speaker. The present Turkish Ambassador, M. Tansu Okandan is well known to me, as are many Embassy Officials in ('snherra. The special relationship between Australia and Turkey is grounded in the shared history of our two nations that, in the very beginning, defined a sense of nationhood in both our countries. Kamal Ataturk who also commanded the Turkish forces at Gallipoli against the Allies, was to later to lead the people of Turkey to become a secular republic in the October of 1923. 373 13 The men who comprised the Anzacs, forged the identity and values of two new nations on the other side of the world. It was said that when those young men left Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of the War, they were British. But when they returned, they returned as Australians and New Zealanders, They returned fired with anew spirit of national identity that resounded in the hearts of the people they had left behind. Their experience drove the sense of nationhood of two nascent democracies. Their values of personal sacrifice and service above self in a higher cause, looking Out for a mate and never giving up are now recognized as part of the Australian psyche. These values were written in blood on Anzac Cove. They informed the consciousness of the following generation of Australians facing the world's worst depression and another World War, and in the uncertain world of the 21' century, these values provide a blue- print for all Australians, especially younger Australians, for our next one hundred years. It was a privilege and an honour to have been able to visit Gallipoli on Anzac Day, and to visit some of the historic aspects of modern Turkey, to have had the opportunity of speaking with the Turkish people and learning of their real affection for Australians. Our historic relationship with Turkey maintains it relevance for the people of both nations, as we face the future together. As a Member of the Australian Parliament, an understanding of the Turkish people, an appreciation of their ancient past and modem future, especially the unique contribution of Australia to the history of modern Turkey, will greatly assist me in that role. I am an enthusiastic member of the Turkish/Australian Parliamentary Friendship Group. During my term in office as the Minister for Veterans Affairs I was fortunate to meet many Turkish/Australians and will continue to reinforce those friendships and work together for the advancement of the peace and mutual benefit of both our nations.

Drove through to the Army Museum Waiouru which includes the Kippenberger Military Archive and Research Library. The Museum's displays are accessed from the Pavilion via a covered walkway leading in to the memorial area Tears On Greenstone- 0 Roimata Founamu. I understand this Museum has a close relationship with our Canberra War Memorial museum. The Museum's displays are based on life-size dioramas and habitat displays supported by the use of artefacts, audio-visuals and photographs. Brought to life before the visitor, the display shows the very human face of their Military history and heritage and the impact it has had on the development of the New Zealand character similar to our Anzac tradition. In almost every decade New Zealand has been involved in some form of conflict and has followed Australia in a lot of the conflicts. The New Zealanders should be proud of their involvement in the various theatres of war and certainly this museum helps other nationalities to understand their commitment to the ANZAC spirit.

To represent Australia at the two day conference of the 21\u00b0 Asia Parliamentarians Meeting on Population and Development in Cambodia. This meeting was focussing on each government's response to population in emergency, for example, when responding to a tsunami or similar disaster. 2. Given my responsibility for government procurement as Parliamentary Secretary for Finance and Administration I also needed to advance government procurement discussions with the Thailand Government, in order to fulfil commitments made at the signing of the Free Trade Agreement with Thailand (TAFTA) in July last year. The formal commitment made in July 2004 is that a joint Thai-Australia government procurement working group, should report to the FTA Joint Commission within twelve months of TAFrA's entry into force (ie before 1 January 2006) on the scope for commencing bilateral negotiations to bring government procurement under TAFTA and the coverage of such negotiations. Since no further work had been undertaken to meet this commitment since its agreement in July, my purpose was to have the working groups membership identified, and a schedule for initial meetings and the purpose of this first meeting agreed to. I was accompanied by a senior departmental official, Mr Jonathan Hutson, Divisional Manager Financial Framework Division, for this component of my work in Thailand. Parliament House, Canberra ACT 2600 Tel: (02) 6271 2016 Fax: SHARMAN STONE Ku' 2 Senator the Hon Eric Abetz 3 In Cambodia, following my attendance at the Population in Emergency Conference, I also sought to build relationships with the Cambodian Government who are seeking advice on the development of their new Financial Management Framework. 4. Finally, I was keen to assess the efficiency of Australian aid in micro-credit programs for rural workers and Australian Federal Police support for the Cambodian police who are tackling human trafficking. (ii) Itinerary: 25-28 April 2005 28 April \u20142 May 2005 2 May 2005 4 May 2005 Bangkok, Thailand Phnom Penh, Cambodia Bangkok, Thailand (in transit) Return to Australia (iii) Key meetings and outcomes/findings: Thailand 26 April 2005: Briefing by Mr William Paterson PSM, Australian Ambassador to Thailand and Embassy officials about current Thai-Australian economic/business relations and the implementation of TAFTA, was invaluable in better understanding the political context and community reaction to Free Trade Agreements, and the TAFTA in particular. Meeting with Ms Chutima Bunyapraphasara, Commercial Adviser, of the Thai Ministry of Commerce and her senior officials about the best process for advancing the government procurement chapter development in the TAFTA. In particular, discussions were about the membership of the proposed joint Thai-Australia working group. Thailand 27 April 2005: Lunch and forum hosted by the Australian Embassy with members of the Australian business community in Bangkok to discuss Australian business development in Thailand and to explore their views about Australian opportunities in the Thai Government procurement market. Australian businesses are succeeding in both services and product supply. Meeting with Mr Viroon Tejapaibul (Thai Vice-Minister for Finance), Mr Boonsak Jiampreecha (Thai Comptroller-General) and other officials to discuss Thai government procurement systems and next steps in forming the joint Thai-Australia working group. Mr Jiampreecha is chairing a Thai Govemnientllndustry group focussed on the implementation of the government procurement chapter of TAFTA. 359 THE HON DR SHARMAN STONE ?vp 3 Senator the Hon Eric Abetz The Thai Government agreed to host the first meeting of the new joint Thai-Australia working group in the next few months. Membership was identified, and the government procurement principles to be included in the scope of the work were discussed. Cambodia 28 April \u20143 May 2005: Thursday 28th April - Meeting with Dr Aun Porn Moniroth, Secretary of State of Ministry of Economy and Finance, Cambodia who visited Australia in March 2005 for discussions with a range of government agencies. Our discussion covered Cambodia's financial management reform program including the areas of procurement and public-private partnerships. Both countries share similar policy objectives which suggests the possibility of opportunities for assistance in capacity building through expansion of contact between Cambodian and Australian officials at senior and working levels and exchange of information. Friday 291b April - Saturday 30th April - Attended the 21 Asian Parliamentarian Meeting on Population and Development - Population in Emergency - Parliamentarians' Response to Social and Economic Recovery. I chaired the session where the Cambodian director of their Reproductive Health Clinic briefed the conference on Cambodia's priorities and progress in dealing with the aftermath of in-country conflict, in particular poverty, violence against women and children, sexual exploitation and the incidence of Sexually Transmitted Disease. Sunday l May - I accompanied the Ambassdor to Cambodia Ms Lisa Filipetto on travel to different parts of Phnom Penh where urban planning and adequate housing is an issue. Monday 2 May - I was accompanied by Mr John Murray, Program Support Unit Manager, AusAid and Mr Om Seng Bora, General Manager of World Vision Fund Cambodia to Samaky Village, Kompong Chhnang Province, Kchharng KarngThoung Village Kchhamg Karnh Thoung Village, Nark Tar Harng Village Bank and client's businesses. At each village I met with the headman and recipients of micro-credit funded by the Australian Government. Through interpreters I was able to gain useful feedback about the success of these schemes, and other issues of concern as villagers try to deal with drought threatening their water supply, as well as their usual poverty. Feedback to world vision also related to the condition of sponsored children in the villages. S Tuesday 3r41 May - Meeting with Ms Janet Ashby, Project Managaer, Asia Regional Cooperation to Prevent People Trafficking, accompanied by Ms Kathryn Elliott, Second Secretary, AusAlD and Ms Jennifer Lean, AusAID. 390 THE HON DR SHARMAN STONE Mr 4 Senator the Hon Eric Abetz Ms Ashby briefed me on the extent of the people trafficking problem, and Australia's role in Cambodian support, in particular the Asia Regional cooperation to prevent People Trafficking, a project funded by the Australian Government. Meeting with Brigadier-General Un Sokunthea, Head of Department of Anti-Human Trafficking, Ministry of Interior, along with five other senior officials and representatives of the Australian Federal Police in Cambodia. The Brigadier-General has been grateful for the Australian financial support of the people trafficking work, including computers and software, motor cycles and capacity building. The Brigadier-General was concerned that she does not have the capacity for DNA sampling to assist in securing convictions. The Brigadier-General is also responsible for Gender Equality programs and support in the Police Department. Discussion centred around how such issues are advanced in Australia and how we could mutually assist one another in this work. A lunch with members of the Australian business community in Cambodia was hosted by Ambassador Lisa Filipetto in order to give me the opportunity to have discussions with some of the pioneers in this market. The Australian businesses described the risks and opportunities that the Cambodian market currently represents. Meeting with Mr Dean Cleland, CEO, ANZ Royal Bank (Cambodia) at their new premises. ANZ Royal is a joint venture which will introduce the first ATMs and other banking services to Cambodia. In particular the Australian CEO described the local staffing recruitment issues and local barriers to market entry. Meeting with HE log Kunthea Phavy, Minister of Women's Affairs along with her senior officials and two other women members of Cambodia's Parliament. The Minister was concerned to learn how Australia deals with increasing participation rates in education, especially for low income communities. In particular she is about to establish education hostels for girls, since unlike boys, they cannot stay in monasteries. (iv) Conclusion: My visit to Thailand was successful. A key goal was to progress the joint Thai-Australia (TAFTA) working group and this was achieved by Thailand agreeing to the membership, broad principles that should be considered, and the time of the first meeting. An agreement on government procurement provides an opportunity for expansion of trade between Australia and Thailand and its negotiation will help build relationships between the two countries. It was also most important that the Australian Government was represented at the Population Development Conference, given our recent response to the Tsunami. The Indonesian Parliamentary representative did not seem to be aware of the full extent of the Australian contribution. This was a good opportunity to ensure Australia's contribution 391 THE HON DR SHARMAN STONE MI' 5 Senator the Hon Eric Abetz was placed on the table, as well as being an opportunity for us to learn what the recipient countries found most useful in the way of direct aid, and its timing. This information has been passed on to DFAT. My bilateral meetings in Cambodia allowed me to understand the impact of Australia's whole of government approach to development assistance, including to address the Government's transnational crime concerns. My meeting with the Ministry of Economy and Finance provided me with an understanding of the Cambodian Government's financial management reform and of multi-donor support through the Public Financial Management (PFM) program. There may be potential for the Department of Finance and Administration to share its expertise through the PFM. I note that in accordance with Clause 9.5 of the Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 14 of 2003 a copy of this statement may be obtained from you upon request by any Member or Senator. I also note that this statement may be tabled in Parliament at your discretion.

Senator The Hon Eric Abetz Special Minister of State Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 My Dear Minister As required under the provisions of Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 14 of 2003 1 submit my report of my recent overseas study tour to Cassino Italy from 30th April 2005 until 8th May 2005. The essential premise of the visit to Cassino was to further advance my knowledge of Italy and to visit and inquire into the loss of twelve Australian pilots and the loss of an Australian war correspondent at the Battle of Monte Cassino in World War Two. I sought to strengthen and promote the bonds of friendship and understanding between the peoples of Australia and the City of Cassino. The tour of the district of Cassino was kindly arranged with transport provided by the City of Cassino Council. I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the stated purpose and aim of my study tour was achieved beyond my highest expectations. Saturday 301h April 2005. Depart Sydney on Singapore Airlines SQ 0222. Sunday 1\" May 2005. Arrive Rome Airport. I was met by a driver from the City of Cassino Council and transported to the city of Cassino and my private accommodation. 8.30 pm Met with Mayor Bruno Scittarelli and Councillors to participate in a welcome dinner to Cassino. P0 BOX 8482 Monday 2.d May 2005. I visited the German World War Two Cemetery at Caira and I was moved by the experience. The Cemetery covers the top of a mountain and I was guided past some twenty thousand grave sites of identified young German men aged on average eighteen years of age. I passed headstones until I reached the summit where I laid flowers at the base of a very large steel cross in memory of these young men... I was then shown sketches of Cassino and hand drawn maps that were drawn by the young German soldiers who had lost their lives in the Battle of Cassino. Exhumation of remains and identification work is still being undertaken with the cost of this work and the outstanding maintenance expenses of the German Cemetery met by the German Government. Identification is difficult and relies on dog tag details and in some cases on dental charts. There were only a few Unknown Soldier graves and these headstones clearly indicated this in the usual manner. I was grateful for the time provided by the curator of the German Cemetery and for the respectful way in which he delivered the information about the fallen servicemen and the history of the cemetery. My visit to the world War Two Commonwealth Cemetery took me to a place of profound peace and spirituality. This huge cemetery is overlooked by the Monte Cassino Abbey the 1,400 year old Benedictine Abbey, the religious structure that instigated such a fierce and costly campaign. It was considered that if the Abbey of Monte Cassino was taken as an artillery observation post then it opened the way to securing control of Rome just 139 kilometres away. The presentation of the Commonwealth Cemetery is outstanding with each headstone having two English flowers at the base and a rose between each grave site. In the Commonwealth Cemetery there are four thousand two hundred and seventy one burial Sites and two hundred eighty nine unidentified graves. Inside the cemetery is the Cassino Memorial that commemorates over four thousand Commonwealth servicemen who took part in the Italian campaign whose graves are not known. Thirteen Australian servicemen are at rest in the Commonwealth Cemetery and they are as follows: RK MacDonald Sydney Morning Herald War Correspondent of Sydney NSW Flight Sergeant RT Bilsby Royal Australian Air Force of Collie WA Warrant Officer CW Crawley Royal Australian Air Force of Junee NSW Warrant Officer AR Stratton Royal Australian Air Force of Norwood SA 400 Flying Officer LA Seymour DFC Royal Australian Air Force of Chatswood NSW Flight sergeant LG Potts Royal Australian Air Force of Newtown NSW Flight Sergeant THA Mallick Royal Australian Air Force of Sydney Warrant Officer CP Luke Royal Australian Air Force of Ourimbah NSW Flight Sergeant TP Laird Royal Australian Air Force of Kellerbemn WA Warrant Officer RRL Hawke Royal Australian Air Force of Midland Junction WA Flight Lieutenant H Elms Royal Australian Air Force of Toowoomba QLD Warrant Officer AW Dowling Royal Australian Air Force of Manly NSW Flying Officer DA Cumming Royal Australian Air Force of Darlington VIC I laid a wreath at the Cross of Sacrifice in memory of the fallen in particular the thirteen Australians who gave their lives in this fierce battle. The Cross of Sacrifice stands at the end of a long reflection pool. The curator of the Cassino Commonwealth Cemetery had a complete knowledge of the Australian graves that I was seeking to view and informed me of the many visitors that came from all over the world although in the main from Commonwealth countries. They come to visit this sacred beautiful resting place and pay their respects to the cream of their nation who paid the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of their respective countries. The emotion I felt when reading the headstones was very profound particularly when I thought about the ages of these young men and realised how their lives had been cut short before they had an opportunity to experience an ongoing life time relationship with their loved ones. I was disappointed as an Australian that there was no recognition of the contribution made by the thirteen Australians buried at the Cassino Commonwealth Cemetery. It would be difficult to find the thirteen Australians grave sites unless considerable time is spent looking for them. I believe the Australian Government should place a plaque to acknowledge the ultimate sacrifice that has been made by these Australians in Cassino and similarly at other grave sites throughout Italy where Australians lost their lives so that others could live in peace. 401 Tuesday 3rd May 2005. I was taken by a guide to view the archaeological Roman ruins and to see the excavation of previous existence of pre Roman time tribes and considered to be the site of the ancient temple of Apollo. I then travelled up to the Monte Cassino Monastery. Saint Benedict founded the Monastery in the year 529 and although the Monastery was destroyed during the intense bombing of 1944, it has been rebuilt by the Cassino community. Over the entrance gate to the Monastery is the word PAX which means PEACE. I was honoured to spend sometime in discussion on world peace and understanding with the Archbishop Dom Pietro. I was then given an extensive tour of the Monastery and I was privileged to view areas such as the underground catacombs that were used by the monks to shelter themselves and refugees during the bombing in World War Two. These areas are not normally visited by the public. I was told as the war came closer to the Monastery and prior to the start of the bombing; the decision was made with the community to remove the treasures to a safe place and to bury some of the more difficult pieces. The transfer to the Vatican of archives, ancient parchment manuscripts, works of art and the library was successfully completed. This work was halted when the Monastery was assured by a German Colonel that the Monastery would not be bombed and they the German troops would not occupy or destroy the Monastery. This of course rapidly changed with the advance of the allies. The treasures have been returned to the Monastery after the severe damage to the Monastery was restored and rebuilt. I visited the Fiat car Factory, and was hosted by the principle Signor Bortone. I was escorted on an extensive tour of this modem computerised factory that at present produces three hundred cars per day. It is planned to lift this volume to almost double this number. This modular integrated factory is ahead of its time, whilst using the latest computerised equipment it still employs approximately seven thousand Cassino people out of a thirty six thousand community. The employees work a twelve hour and there are two shifts per day. Fiat uses teams of experts in the production process to do the fine detailing and fittings such as side mirrors and windscreens. I also was able to view the latest Fiat model the Coma, a model for which they have high hopes of success. Wednesday 4'h May 2005. Talks were held with the Mayor Bruno Scittarelli and the Council of Cassino. 402 Discussion then flowed freely around the advantages of the arrangements with\" The Sister City\" scheme. The City of Cassino has twelve such arrangements but of course the close proximately to Europe encourages such a scheme. Casino in New South Wales Australia has a Sister City agreement with Cassino Italy but exchange visits are limited due to cost and the distance of time. I was made aware of the funding arrangements in the City of Cassino and the way their electoral system works. The meeting reflected on the close ties between the Australian and Italian communities. I had discussion with the head Doctor Gerandino Casale who directs the one mobile mammography unit that delivers mobile screening and service to 100 women per day. The marked difference between Australia Breast Screen and the Italian model was that women in Italy are encouraged to be screened at forty five years of age. Lengthy dialogue revealed that the two systems are very similar except for the active encouragement of younger women in Italy due to the increased numbers of detection of breast cancer in women forty years plus. Pamphlets have been found to produce the best response from women to the mobile Mammography Screening. After these meetings a major street was closed so that the Mayor of Cassino Bruno Scittarelli, Mr Tony Lamarra Deputy Mayor of Goulbum in the Hume Electorate who was born in Cassino and I were invited to place a wreath at the major war memorial in Cassino. This huge wreath was placed in memory of the fallen and was filmed for the evening news. I travelled to Gaeta to visit the ancient fort that was utilised as a prison for two German prisoners of war in 1945. Discussions were held with the Board regarding the possible uses of such a huge facility and the potential for Australian tourists. I was taken to a Monastery on the mountain where many believe Jesus placed his hand and split the mountain. Thursday 51b May 2005. I attended the Italian Parliament in Rome where I was fortunate to have an extensive tour of a very impressive building. Senator Prof. Oreste Tofani Vice President of the Parliament invited me to have discussions with him about the Australian Electoral system, the different issues that are raised with him from his constituency and the approach of each of us to each election. I noted the strong and evident security, particularly with the arrival of the Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The display of fire arms by the security guards was always apparent with the general public kept some distance away. Senator Tofani indicated that they do not allow photographs for security reasons on the street but Senator Tofani was happy to have a photograph taken inside his Parliamentary suite. 4ft In the afternoon I was taken to a small village called Anagni to view the outstanding copper and brass work of Egidio Ambrosetti. Signor Ambrosetti has worked for many years at the Vatican designing a large variety of religious objects and sculpturing very large statues for the Vatican and other churches. He has been honoured by the late Pope John Paul for his generosity to the church, outstanding talent and dedication to his ancient craft. Discussion followed with Signor Ambrosetti indicating that he would like to bring an exhibition of his valuable sculptures to Australia. Signor Ambrosetti's success is all the more remarkable as he operates a \"cottage industry\" at home employing a son and several other labourers. In the evening I had more discussion with the Cassino Council regarding occupational health and safety issues. I was then informed of the way that the City of Cassino pipes water of which they have plenty of underground water to the City of Naples, 100 kilometres away via a huge pipeline which cost A$300 million dollars to construct some twenty years ago. This water is the total supply for three million people in the City of Naples. Friday 6'h May 2005. I was taken by mini bus to visit the ruins of the City of Pompeii some three hours travel with stops along the way at villages. I was able to spend quite sometime at Pompeii inspecting the excavations and relics as well as admiring what had obliviously been quite substantial extravagant buildings. The most startling discovery was that I was able to call my office on my mobile telephone and have a staff member comment that the reception was clearer than when I use my mobile telephone on the Hume Highway. In the evening I attended a farewell reception organised by the Cassino Council. The evening was attended by all the elected Councillors and a number of the staff as well. The warmth of affection for Australia was apparent and the need to maintain close contact repeated over and over again. Saturday May 2005. I spent time in the City of Cassino meeting with local people most of whom had relatives in Australia. It was brought to my attention that on Saturday in Cassino more than one hundred thousand people visit and shop in the city. The majority of the day was spent visiting various areas to view the various places that people fled in an attempt to escape the bombing during the war. I had many discussions with people who relayed to me their terrible war experiences and stories of how they survived without adequate food and medical supplies. 404 I was invited to the village of Sant' Angelo in the Theodice to participate in a small way in \"La Festa Della Picta\"that is a festival that is held in May of each year to celebrate the end of World War two. Sant' Angelo was part of the \"Gustav Line and I was able to see the Gari River flats that during the allies advance had been denuded of trees by the Germans so that the Allies were easy targets from the higher site of Monti Cassino Monastery. The bombing of Sant' Angelo began on the 20h January 1944 and heavy losses were endured as the allies attempted to advance on Monastery Hill. Some seventy five thousand people including civilians lost their lives in this fierce campaign with some twenty five thousand people maimed. I spent quite sometime in the village of Sant' Angelo listening to the tragic stones of war and witnessing the strength of the people determined to survive the horror that lives so vividly in their memory. I laid a wreath at the Sant' Angelo war memorial and visited the Church where they plan to have huge doors constructed in memory of the many fallen. In the evening after another farewell dinner with the City of Cassino Council I travelled again to Sant' Angelo to witness an outdoor concert that is an important part of the Sant' Angelo Festival. Sunday 8'h May 2005. 1 departed Rome on Singapore Airlines Flight SQ 339. Monday 91b May 2005. I arrived at Sydney Airport. I then travelled to Canberra so that I would be present for the Budget Sitting of Parliament on Tuesday 10th May 2005. Conclusion The visit proved to be very relevant to my parliamentary duties and in particular in view of the Italian constituency in the Home Electorate. I believe that visits such as this one also strengthens the tics and understanding between our countries. I reiterate the point of concern that I raised earlier in this report that is, there is not one identifying monument or plaque to signify the sacrifice made by Australian servicemen in Italy. It is also a concern to me that the City of Cassino hosts a celebration to commemorate the end of World War Two in the third week in May every year at which eighteen nations send representatives but Australia has never participated in this famous event. 1/ ALBY SChuLTZ Federal Member for Hume I wish to say that the courtesy extended to me as a Member of the Australian Parliament by Mayor Bruno Scrittelli, every City of Cassino Councillor, the council staff and especially General Manager Gianni Ranaldi was outstanding. This was an indication of the strong association, commitment and affection the people of Italy have to and for the Australian people. I commend this report to the Minister.

Dear Minister, In accordance with the requirements of Clause 9.2(b) of Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 14 of 2003, I submit the following statement reporting on my recent overseas study journey. I travelled for the purpose of gaining an understanding of the issues relating to the common border between Papua New Guinea and Australia and how those issues affect my constituents in Torres Strait specifically and Far North Queensland generally. My specific aim was to obtain from Papua New Guinea officials facts and views in relation to the common border and to establish how they are affecting and will affect relations with Australia and its citizens in the Tortes Strait. On 5 May I travelled to the Papua New Guinea town of Daru, the administrative headquarters of Western Province, which is the principal border province of Papua New Guinea. In Darn, I had the following meetings: Hon Tom Sima, Deputy Town Mayor Hon Segewo Kame, President of Kiwai Local Level Government Hon Mrs Wimo, Nominated Member for South Fly. Mr Frank Botude National Agency Functions co-ordinator, Provincial Administration Sergeant in charge, Darn Police Station. Patrick Kusare, National Intelligence Organisation representative, Western Province Mr Les Ture, Manager of Customs, Western Province. Mr Nasser Temai, Border Liaison Officer, Department of Foreign Affairs. Mr Ravini Igo, Border Administration Officer, Department of Provincial Affairs.

At those meetings I discussed a wide range of subjects relevant to my interests and responsibilities as Senator for Queensland. These included general border issues and the way the Torres Strait Treaty operates, health, aid projects in the province, including those administered by AusAlD, fisheries and border security. My study tour has enabled me to develop further understanding of the relationship between Papua New Guinea and Australia and how that relationship has a daily impact on the lives of my constituents in Torres Strait and elsewhere in Far North Queensland.

Eric Abetz Special Minister of State Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 88 Collins SI, Hobart 7000 i-h 03) Hobart tao 7001 S This letter is to follow up on my earlier correspondence to you dated 11 and 21 April 2005 in which I advised that I might seek reimbursement of some component of my recent trip to China under my Overseas Study Travel Entitlement. I confirm that I undertook travel to China between the dates I indicated to you. As I set out in that correspondence, I have personally met the cost of my airfares, accommodation and the like however, there is one component of my travel which I believe is appropriate to draw down on my study leave entitlement. On Friday the 6th of May, I obtained the services of a car and driver to take me from Shanghai to Nanjing where I visited the Sun Yat Sen memorial and then spent several hours at the Nanjing massacre museum. I did so in response to my desire to be better informed about the Chinese reaction to the recent publication of Japanese text books which provoked a series of demonstrations against Japanese properties in China and in particular Shanghai. I was particularly minded to do this because the location of my stay in Shanghai was immediately adjacent to the Japanese consulate and the aftermath of those demonstrations was very plain to see in the large presence of armed Chinese troops and the barricades that have been erected in the streets to prevent further access to the Japanese consulate if any other demonstrations were held. The visit to Nanjing certainly placed in stark light the reason why Chinese sensitivities still exists with respect to the massacres that occurred when the Japanese invaded China. At the time and shortly after the Japanese conquest of Nanjing. some 300,000 Chinese were massacred at a variety of different sites. The massacre museum provides both written and photographic testimony of those events and it also gives a good insight into contemporary Chinese thinking regarding the lessons that China should lean about not forgetting those particular deaths and their determination that they not be in a position of weakness in the future which would allow similar depredations. Of course the time I was in China also coincided with the apologies made by the Japanese Prime Minister which were both unprecedented and extremely welcome to the Chinese community. Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600 Telephone (02) 6277 2178 416 I visited Nanjing a day after the official day set aside to commemorate the Japanese wartime atrocities but there was still a very significant sense of sombre reflection amongst those who took part in the viewing of the exhibits. I believe this visit deepened my appreciation and understanding of one of the flashpoints of potential misunderstanding between China and Japan and given the immediate circumstances with the demonstrations and riots in Shanghai, the apology of the Japanese Prime Minister and the fact that the National Day of Remembrance of the massacres coincided with my time in China, I thought it would have been a great opportunity missed if I had not gone to learn more about this particular aspect of Chinese history. For those reasons icc\u00c3\u00b3dingly submit my account for reimbursement for that days travel to Nanjing and return and I would be grateful if the appropriate arrangements for conversion to Australian currency and reimbursement are undertaken.

Eric Abetz, Special Minister of State, Suite MG.50, Parliament House, CANBERRA ACT 2600 Dear Minister, In accordance with the requirements of Clause 9.2(b) of Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 14 of 2003, I submit the following statement reporting on my recent overseas study journey: (i) (a) Confirmation of Purpose: \u00e2\u00a2 To attend the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues at the United Nations from the 16th to 27 th May 2005 in New York as part of the Australian delegation. \u00e2\u00a2 To visit the National Aquarium in Baltimore to inspect progress on an exhibit which seeks to replicate a gorge in the Northern Territory and Washington to meet with the acting Ambassador. The itinerary and meetings held follow. Friday. 1315 May 2005: 1720 lu-s Arrive New York QF. 107 Monday. I6 May2005: Commencement of Forum. The Head of the Australian Delegation was Mr Peter Vaughan, other members were Ms Shirley McPherson the Chair of the Indigenous Land Corporation, Ms Sarah Galvin, a DFAT employee and Wan-en Snowdon. Professor Mick Dodson was appointed as Rapporteur for the meeting. Australian Indigenous NGO participants comprised of Mr Lea Malezer and two World Council of Church nominees. Email: wsrrwLsnowdon.rnQ@aph.Qov au WaS wariarisnowdon.m by SyNQb by, pma,. ia pew 9 smai sm.i N Ni The forum met on at daily basis at the United Nations Headquarters, and the delegation attended all of the open sessions of the Forum over the two weeks of its meetings. Warren Snowdon attended the Australian Mission to the UN on a daily basis and had meetings with various Mission staff over the period including with the Ambassador HE Mr John Dauth as well as with his deputy Mr Peter Tesch. The first week of the Forum deliberations focussed on the special theme of Indigenous peoples and the Millenium Development Goals, in particular, the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger and universal primary education. Statements were made by participating tiN agencies, NGOs, States and members of the forum on both goals. The deliberations during the second week focussed on the ongoing priorities and themes of the forum and the adoption of the report. During the course of the forum Australia made two interventions, one by Ms McPherson under the agenda item dealing with the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, and the other by Warren Snowdon on data collection. Observations It is worth noting that relatively few States intervened generally these interventions were by the \"friends\" of the Forum, which included among others Denmark, Canada and Australia. By contrast there were a large number of interventions by NGOs. It is apparent that if the Forum is to be successful that there must be greater engagement from a broader range of States. This was recognised by the Forum members as well as those States in attendance. It is noticeable that Australia is regarded as having a considerable amount to offer and is well regarded for its participation in and support of the Forum. One of the major issues confronting the Forum is how to insure that there is meaningful work done during the 50 week period when the Forum is not in session. In this regard there should be efforts made to build on work already done to regionalise the work of the Forum. From an Australian and Pacific perspective work needs to be done and resources obtained to provide for the ongoing needs of the \"Pacific Caucus\". Monday, 23 May, 2005: 0700 hrs Depart New York by Amtrak train 0920 firs Arrive Baltimore 4'1 Meeting with National Aquarium to look at progress on a major exhibit featuring a depiction of Umbrawarra Gorge from the Northern Territory. This visit involved meeting the Chairman and CEO of the Aquarium as well as an inspection of fauna exhibits to be displayed when the \"gorge' is opened, probably in October. The Aquarium is spending around US$72m on this project which when completed will be accessed by an expected 2.2 million visitors a year. It is a project of major significance to Australia and the Northern Temtory in particular. 1418 hrs Depart Baltimore by Amtrak train 1459 hrs Arrive Washington Meeting with HE Mr Peter Baxter the acting Australian Ambassador to the United States to discuss Australia's involvement in the Aquarium project Tuesday. 24th May 2005: 0600 hrs Depart Washing by Amtrak train 0859 hrs Arrive New York Friday. 27tb May 2005: 1920 hrs Depart New York QF. 108 Sunday, 29th May 2005: 0725 hrs Arrive Sydney Outcomes The major outcome from participation of the Forum was an increased understanding of the operation of the Forum itself as part of the UN process and greatly improved appreciation of the issues confronting Indigenous peoples globally. In terms of the National Aquarium the most important outcome was an appreciation of the potential significance of the project to Australia's national interest and the opportunities presented by it. 42 (ii) Conclusion: I note that in accordance with Clause 9.5 of the Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 14 of 2003 a copy of this statement maybe obtained from you upon request by any Member or Senator.

As a Member of the Howard Government. Secretary of the Australia-China IPU Group and the Government's Foreign Affairs and Trade Committee, an appreciation of the challenges and issues in the Australia-China relationship is essential. This study has provided me with the opportunity to not only meet and listen to some of the most influential business leaders whose companies invest or trade with China, was a rare opportunity. Having the opportunity to discuss China's place in the region and in world affairs with significant Chinese political and policy leaders was especially instructive in learning about where China might head in the next 25 years at the beginning of the 210 Century.

Confirmation of purpose a. The purpose of this visit was to: The purpose of my visit to Bangkok on 10 June 2005 was to attend the Asia Society's 15 11, Asian Corporate Conference as the keynote speaker in a session entitled \"Implications of China's Rise and Japan's Recovery\". While I was in Bangkok, I also used the opportunity to speak with the Thai Government about the continued spread of Avian Influenza and its implications for the region. With the help of the Australian Embassy I was able to meet with Dr Chaweewan Leowijuk, Deputy Director General of the DLD, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives to discuss Thailand's Emergency Preparedness Plan for Avian Influenza. Ms Chantanee Buranathai, a Veterinary Officer at the DLD and Ms Bronwyn Robbins, First Secretary of AusAlD were also present at this meeting. 653 Wynn,..a Road. - KevinRod.MP@aph.*ov.m, Ms Chantanee outlined the three-year plan adopted by Thailand and focused on two aspects: human health and animal health. She outlined in particular Thailand's plan to combat the threat to humans, which incorporates surveillance, the stockpiling of Tamiflu vaccine and a public awareness campaign. On the question of animal health, Ms Chantanee reported that this plan included eradicating the virus, restricting the movement of affected animals, compensation for farmers, a public awareness campaign and nationwide surveillance. I learnt that this plan is to be sourced through Thailand's central government budget, the Ministry of Agriculture's budget and emergency funds provided to provincial governors. I was advised that approximately B300 million (A$10 million) had been allocated to livestock and B500 million (A$16.6 million) for Health. The Thai Government audited poultry farmers in October 2004 in a door to door campaign conducted by Health Department volunteers. In February 2005, a cross section of farmers were analysed, followed by a culling of poultry within a 5km radius of infected farms. I raised the question of whether or not there remained any weaknesses in Thailand's response to Avian Influenza at this meeting. Dr Chaweewan advised me that finances were adequate to combat the threat and that cooperation from farmers, especially smallholders, was the main issue. She said that farmers indicated a strong preference for a vaccination program rather than the adoption of culling as a control method. This was contrary to the Thai Government's policy of eradication of the virus rather than control. Despite the Government's concern that use of the vaccine may in fact mask virus symptoms in infected poultry, they are currently researching appropriate vaccines for the virus strain currently found in Thailand. A significant impediment to the development of a vaccine is the continually mutating nature of the virus. In response to my query about human-to-human transmission of the virus, Dr Chaweewan indicated an absence of scientific evidence with the exception of an infected family cluster in Thailand and Vietnam. The veterinary community did not perceive this transmission to be a serious threat. Dr Chaweewan and I discussed Thailand's dose working relationship with Vietnam on Avian Influenza. Vietnam's challenge is containment of a large poultry population, especially ducks, and the live bird market. Ducks present a real danger as infected ducks do not display symptoms. The Vietnamese Director General of Livestock's request for bilateral assistance resulted in substantial funding from international donors. This assistance, combined with functioning laboratories, mean that Vietnam should be able to manage another outbreak. 2 413 Dr Chaweewan expressed concerns that Cambodia faced a greater threat without laboratory facilities and very limited resources. Thailand has provided Cambodia capacity-building in livestock diagnosis through JICA and FAO funded programs as well as from Thailand's own aid budget. However, without diagnostic laboratories in their own country, Dr Chaweewan noted that this training was not sustainable. The Thai Government's compensation scheme is based on 75 per cent of market price. In the initial outbreak, farmers had been paid B40 (A$1.30) per bird and a restocking payment which in some cases amounted to more than the market price. Vietnam has also implemented a compensation scheme. Overall this was a very informative meeting as it enabled me to gain a better understanding of the role played by regional governments in combating the Avian Influenza threat. It also provided me with some valuable insight as to the role Australia should be undertaking in helping combat Al. Immediately after my meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives I went to the Asia Society Conference to speak at the session entitled \"Implications of China's Rise and Japan's Recovery\" and participate in other sessions. This session covered a large number of topics including: \u00e2\u00a2 The Rise of China and its economic and security implications for the region. \u00e2\u00a2 The future of the Chinese economy - with particular emphasis on the current and future Chinese export regime. \u00e2\u00a2 China's participation in regional architecture, in particular ASEAN Plus Three and the upcoming East Asian Summit. \u00e2\u00a2 Japan's Role in ASEAN Plus Three and the upcoming East Asian Summit. \u00e2\u00a2 Japan's economic recovery and its implications for the region. In this session I also participated as a panelist alongside Former U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, Chairman of Hang Lung Properties Limited Ronnie C. Chan and Director of the Japan Institute of International Affairs Makio Miyagawa. b. Itinerary (see attached). 3 434 Conclusion This was a productive and informative trip. I was able to engage in a high-level debate on the future of China and Japan in our region. This was particularly helpful as it came at a time when Australia is engaged in a debate over its participation in emerging East Asian architecture, such as the East Asia Summit and East Asian Community. I have attached below a copy of my address to the Asia Society Conference. I was also grateful for the opportunity while I was in Bangkok on that day to gain a better understanding of the spread of Avian Influenza. Australia clearly has a role to play in helping combat the influenza which will involve working closely and cooperatively with our regional neighbours. It was very useful to be able to hear the views of the Thai Government on the threat and spread of the influenza and how Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia are working to minimise its spread. I am more than happy to elaborate on any of the points above. I understand that knowingly giving false and misleading information is a serious offence.

Key meetings and outcomes/findings: London Meeting with Peter Facey, Director, New Politics Network. The meeting was held to discuss the current State of political participation in the U.K. and strategies to improve the connections between people and politics. We discussed the Network's research and recommendations for change for both political institutions and voter education and explored Mr Facey's view that although support for political parties had declined, they remained essential agencies in modem democracies. Mr Facey indicated that it was his view that, despite increasing cynicism about political parties and politics generally in the U.K., education and reform were the necessary remedies. He also indicated that he believed further investigation was needed into the role the media played in eroding public confidence and fostering sense of helplessness among voters. We explored the dimensions of active citizenship education (which he argued was much broader than civics) and the best means of teaching citizenship. Mr Facey reported on various programs to encourage people to actively influence the political system beginning 435 with involvement at school, particularly in school councils with real power. He also pointed to the importance of exposing young people to political parties in schools and suggested the need for students to be exposed to public debates involving young people from all the political groupings. We discussed a number of international experiments to increase citizens' involvement in policy development, including the British Columbia Citizen's Assembly, the Scottish Civic Forum, the EU consultation and the Scottish Youth Parliament, and strategies to increase party membership and involvement e.g. changes to increase involvement in candidate selection. We also discussed \"social exclusion\" and low voter turnout amongst disadvantaged groups in the U.K. Mr Facey outlined the success of neighbourhood networks and direct involvement in decisions such as design of housing estates, parks and service delivery, including security and policing. Edinburgh Visit to Scottish Parliament In a visit to the Scottish Parliament, I took part in a wide ranging discussion which covered the operation of the Committee system, the role of petitions in guiding inquiries, the balance between the executive and the legislature and the effects of devolution on the public service. I was repeatedly told that accessibility to Parliament and the ability of civil society to influence the policy and decision-making process is regarded as the \"cornerstone\" of the Scottish Constitution. (Note: The Scottish Parliament is currently holding a \"Festival of Politics\" (www.festivalofpolitics.org.uk), billed as a festival \"where politics meets the people\" and including musical performances and theatre in the debating chamber and debates with members of the Scottish Youth Parliament. Members of the public have been invited to submit questions to a special Question Time. It's pretty hard to imagine any such event taking place in our own self-important institution.) MSPs pointed out that although, as in Australia, the initiative for legislation was largely dominated by executive, there was a much greater requirement for Ministers to work with the committees to get legislation accepted and passed. Committee inquiries were said to generate strong interest and it appeared that they had much greater influence over legislation than in the Australian Federal Parliament. MSPs agreed that the public service was still coming to terms with devolution and were not yet accustomed to consult with community as required by the Scottish parliament - the \"Community Scotland\" initiative. I also met the Minister responsible for increasing community involvement and building confidence in the new Parliament. We discussed the greater ability of local MSPs to facilitate political engagement when compared to their national colleagues. She briefly outlined the government's \"civic participation\" policies. Meeting with Ms Alison Plans and Ms Victoria Mime, Civic Participation Branch and Mr Stephen Bruce, Legal and Parliamentary Services Branch. The meeting was organised to discuss the Scottish Executive policy on civic participation, including the current program for developing a strategic approach for civic participation (see attachment 2). The officials described the establishment of a steering group to co -ordinate civic participation across all government departments and the work that had been undertaken to define core concepts and target groups: What is civic participation? How do you to it? They described the outcomes of various community meetings on participation as part of \"Community Scotland\" and outlined the special attention that was being paid to regions and groups identified as being less likely to spontaneously participate. They stressed the need to expand participation beyond the \"usual suspects\" and to precisely identify those people who are usually excluded. It was clear that there were high expectations in the community, not least because the objective of civic participation is one of the founding principles of Scottish devolution. From their inception the Scottish Parliament and Executive have emphasised the importance of effective participation'. Indeed a Policy Unit report said: 'Civic participation is an essential tool of modern government'2. It argues that: 'Inclusiveness in the policy making process is a key principle at the core of the modernising government agenda'. The officials also outlined the Government's desire to go beyond consultation and to ensure ongoing dialogue and engagement. They indicated that the process involves capacity building and application of resources to encourage and facilitate engagement. They pointed to the importance of recognising and overcoming resistance and cynicism in the community and indicated how important it was to give feedback about the uses to which information and opinions gleaned are put. They also highlighted the important role of Parliamentary Committees in facilitating consultation, particularly through petitions and petition generated inquiries (see attachment 3). The officials outlined the organisational change within government - \"changing to deliver\" - which had been designed to ensure that departments and agencies were more open and more outward focused. Departments are required to register consultation exercises and to meet agreed standards for community engagement. The Civic I 'Our recommendations... envisage a process which involves genuine partklpasion and consultation led by the Executive. Parliament and the Executive [should] take full account of the views of those most likely to be affected by the consideration of policy or Policy Unit (2000). 'Civic Participation' 3 440 a Participation Branch conducts research and evaluation programs to better understand what works and what doesn't, tracks public attitudes to participation, develops innovative techniques including deliberative methods, seeks to understand the reasons for lack of engagement and provides feedback on how such participation contributes to policy development, program delivery and legislative review. Part of their task is to identify gaps in consultation and representation and to monitor operational glitches. Their research shows the majority (67%) of Scots want to be involved is such programs and generally prefer conventional methods to the internet or other ICT. It is also clear that people from deprived areas are less likely to be interested and/or engaged. This presents the government with a major challenge. A meeting with Ms Anne Stoker, Education Department, HM Inspectorate of Education expanded the discussion to include young people's participation in civic affairs. Meeting with Canon Dr Kenyon Wright I also met with Canon Dr Kenyon Wright CBE, former Chairman of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, current member of the Scottish Liberal Democrat Party, and Chair of Vision 21, the Scottish Churches' Group on the future of Scotland, for general discussions on the development of the Scottish constitution and the success of the civic participation initiatives to date. Meeting with Ms Lauren Murdoch, Scottish Civic Forum. A subsequent meeting with Civic Forum staff allowed a further assessment of the programs from the viewpoint of community organisations. The government funded Scottish Civic Forum was established to support the Parliament's efforts to meet the challenge of expanding civic participation and to help ensure that these high ambitions become a tangible reality. The Scottish Civic Forum was established to serve both civic organisations and individuals and is designed to act as a gateway between Scottish Government, civic organisations and the wider society. The Forum facilitates debate on political issues affecting Scottish society, shares information about current legislation going through parliament and educates people so that they are better able to be involved in decisions made by the government that affect their lives. They also suggest ways in which the government might become more democratic and try to reach those people whose voices are not otherwise heard. a Meeting with Mr Marcus Liddle OBE, Chief Executive, Young Scot and Mr Patrick McMenamin, Head of Youth Intelligence & International Affairs, Youthlink Scotland Mr Liddle and Mr McMenamin outlined the efforts being made by \"Young Scot\" and local government in collaboration with Scottish executive to engage young people in Scottish affairs. They described innovative approaches aimed at young Scots between 12 441 and 26 to provide information, to help them make informed choices and play a part in their community while making the most of their free time and learning. Through the device of Young Scot card, young people are put into contact with services and organisations which can assist them, with the arts and with information sources designed to be lively and informative (www.youngscot.org.uk ). The card also provides attractive discounts for goods and services at over 1,800 outlets in Scotland, ranging from cinemas and theatres, to shopping, sports and travel. It is also valid in 42 European countries. At a later meeting with a representative pf the Scottish Youth Parliament (www.scottishyouthparliament.org.ukjindex.asp), collaborative ventures between Young Scot, local government and the Youth Parliament were outlined. The Youth Parliament started 1n1999 and is comprised of nearly 200 elected young people aged between 14 and 25 years. They aim to provide national youth voice for all young people in Scotland, meeting three times a year, discussing issues which affect young people across Scotland and proposing innovative solutions to these problems and situations. The Parliament enjoys cross party support from the Parliament and members have had generous access to both government and opposition parties alike, including the First Minister, other Party Leaders and even the British Prime Minister. Norway: Bergen Meeting with Mr Dag Arne Christensen, Local Democracy Commission Secretariat. Mr Christensen outlined the various initiatives being undertaken in Norway to enhance civic participation and to improve the relationship between political parties, governments and the people. We discussed the decline in voter turnout and political participation more generally and the reasons for this international trend. Through his research interests and as a member of the Local Democracy Secretariat, Mr Christensen has a comprehensive knowledge of international, as well as local tends in participation. He pointed out that participation is easier in smaller organisations and the tendency to aggregate local government regions and/or transfer responsibility to national governments actually works against citizen involvement. His view was that this trend, together with the tendency to transfer responsibility to non-government organisations, had the effect of making it difficult for voters to know who is responsible for various outcomes (and failures) of policy. The result was likely to be further alienation from the political process. He affirmed one of the major findings of the Norwegian Power Study (see below), that real power had been transferred from representative political organisations to the private sector and to non-government bodies contracted to provide services. 5 442 4 S We discussed the declines in political party membership in Scandinavia and the possible causes of this decline, although the level of membership far exceeds that in Australia. It needs to be remembered that such membership approaches 8%-9% in Norway, a figure approximately 10 times greater than in Australia. The professional isation of politics and the push toward \"individualistic\" solutions to social problems and the pressure of modem working patterns were identified as contributing factors. Oslo Meeting with Researcher Ms Sissel Hovik, Democracy and Governance Research, Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research (NIBR) We discussed Ms Hovik's research and the role of the Institute, including environmental policy and sustainable management, municipal management and the relationship between central and local government, and the evaluation of public administration. NEBR is an independent social science research centre whose aim is to publicise research based insights for the benefit of decision-makers and the wider community. It has a cross disciplinary and global perspective much of which is designed to increase citizen involvement and co-operation. Their current research program includes an analysis of European Fisheries Policy and the impact of policy changes on regional economies and societies as well as the environment; sustainable urban development; children and young adults at risk; participation, leadership and the quality of urban life and the essential components and processes of good local governance. We discussed various approaches to routinely integrating social welfare and health effects of urban and regional planning and creating better dialogues between local governments and their constituents. Using the example of fisheries policy, Ms Hovik illustrated various strategies for reconciling competing interests and territorial disputes eg between commercial fishing, tourism, the environment and local amenity Meeting with Director Fredrik Engeistad and staff of the Institute for Social Research. Dr Engelstad was a member of the core group of the Norwegian Power and Democracy Study 1998-2003 and a Member of the Committee on Nordic Democracy. My principal interest in meeting with him was to explore the outcomes of the five year \"Power and Democracy\" study commissioned by the Norwegian Parliament (Storting). The Norwegian Study of Power and Democracy was designed to diagnose the health of the democratic system in Norway. Similar studies have also been undertaken in Sweden and Denmark. The study was undertaken by a multi-disciplinary academic team drawn from the law, social sciences and humanities and provided with a generous budget and wide terms of reference. Dr Englestad and his staff outlined the broad parameters of the studies and the principal conclusions. 6 44 The report to the Parliament included the blunt assessment that \"democracy - fundamentally understood as representative democracy, a formal decision-making system employing election by a majority and directly elected bodies - is in decline. The political purchasing power of the voter ballot has been diminished.\" Although there were tow dissenting views amongst the panel of researchers, there was general agreement that the power of the people in the chain of governance had been weakened. The major areas investigated were: \u00e2\u00a2 The state of the political parties \u00e2\u00a2 The political functions of courts \u00e2\u00a2 Local democracy \u00e2\u00a2 Associations and pressure groups \u00e2\u00a2 Markets and economic power \u00e2\u00a2 The petroleum economy \u00e2\u00a2 Global finance \u00e2\u00a2 Journalism and the media \u00e2\u00a2 Changing gender relations \u00e2\u00a2 Language and symbolic power \u00e2\u00a2 Care and social services \u00e2\u00a2 Economic democracy \u00e2\u00a2 Minorities and multiculturalism \u00e2\u00a2 New information technology \u00e2\u00a2 Foreign policy and development aid \u00e2\u00a2 Social capital \u00e2\u00a2 European integration and supranational law The study documented the many ways in which political participation is in decline, including in political parties and broad social movements such as unions, church and charitable organisations. The report was clear, however, that people were not turning away from politics because their values had changed, but rather because of the way constitutional politics was changing. People were as interested as ever in political issues, but appeared to have correctly concluded that the decision making power of the legislature was in decline. The authors reported that large economic actors were, ass result of globalisation, more powerful largely because of the credible threat that they may move capital, production, headquarters or jobs out of the country or region. As one researcher put it, \"business has acquired veto power in economic policy.\" The study also highlighted the decline in local autonomy as local governments are overwhelmed by revenue linked policy directives from central governments. It is, as one researcher put it, that the \"central government has power without responsibility and the local government responsibility without power.\" 7 444 The study also examined the contribution of European and supra-national law and conventions in limiting national legislation and the role of the media in setting agendas not necessarily embraced by the wider community. The findings are highly relevant to Australia and deserve attention; not least because they are the result of observing a democracy that is one of the most robust of contemporary democracies. It is also one of the wealthiest countries in the world with a strong redistributive welfare state and regularly outperforms other OECD nations on a range of social and economic measures of wellbeing. Its governance is honest and well regarded and its democratic institutions retain legitimacy. As Stein Ringen asked in his review of the study, \"If this is the kind of polity in which rule by popular consent is withering, what then in more normal democracies where trust is normally thin, economic power more normally strong, governance and public finance more normally in shambles and conflicts more normally pronounced.\" Meeting with Peter A. Torjesen, groupleader of Arbeiderpartiet in Ama, Oslo. In the meeting with Mr Toijesen we discussed his experience in working with the people of Ama, one of eight areas which have been selected by the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development to take part in a program to improve efficiency and quality of services and develop local democracy and citizen participation. We visited a community centre and public housing estate in Alna and compared the involvement of local people in decision making about housing, recreation, aged care and health care in Norway and Australia. He stressed the importance of organising the services around the person, not the agency responsible and of involving service users at every point of planning and delivery. Sweden Stockholm Meeting with Ms Use Bergh, State Secretary, Ministry of Justice Ms Berg outlined the Swedish government's democracy policy for which her department is responsible (see attachment 4). Goals were established as part of the national strategy for safeguarding and deepening Swedish democracy and programs developed to implement them. The government is currently assessing the success of measures already implemented and developing improved measures for removing structural obstacles which hinder individuals from gaining access to power and political influence. Following the Government Commission on Swedish Democracy in 1997, the government introduced systematic national initiatives to promote democratic development, including legislation to facilitate and co-ordinate government action and set long-term goals for greater and more equal participation of Swedish citizens in their democracy. Four key goals were adopted: \u00e2\u00a2 To increase voter turnout in all elections, including to the European Parliament; \u00e2\u00a2 To increase in the number of citizens holding some form of political appointment V or position; \u00e2\u00a2 To provide more and better opportunities for Citizens to participate in and influence the political process; and an increase in the overall number of citizens taking part; and \u00e2\u00a2 To achieve more equal participation in the political process; a broader cross section of the population including young people, the unemployed and people from foreign backgrounds. Strategies for improving the measurement and reporting on the success of initiatives were the subject of detailed research. For example, the government found that there was little information about whether and to what extent people believed they could influence political conditions, so research was commissioned to address this question. Statistics Sweden was given the task of collecting and collating data relating to local government, including government-citizen relations and forms of local government co-operation. The most recent evaluation of the extent to which the stated goals have been met indicates that voter turnout had stabilised and voting procedures were simpler and better understood. There was also an upswing in the representativeness of elected members at local government level with more women, young people and those born outside Sweden holding political positions. However, the total number of political appointments at municipal level continued to fall. While the evaluation showed that the desire to influence the political process is strong and widespread, the fastest growing forms of participation are those which are organised without official assistance. The government regards harnessing this involvement as a vital task. I also met with Maria Jansson and Professor Barbara Hobson from Stockholm University and Martha Blomquist from Uppsala University. In separate meetings, we canvassed the status of women in Swedish society, the participation of women in the political system and trends in the working and domestic lives of Swedish women, comparing their circumstances with those in Australia and elsewhere in the developed world. Although it is clear that Swedish women enjoy a much greater role in politics at all levels than is the case in Australia, there remain inequalities in Swedish society which continue to be the focus for concerted action. The program for equality is still alive and many women are acutely aware of the continuing gap between experience and policy e.g. that most domestic work is still undertaken by women and the gender pay gap in the paid workforce. Meeting with Mr Andrew Ellis, Head of Elections Team and Mr Goran Fejic, Head of Democracy Building and Conflict Management of IDEA (International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance). Mr Ellis outlined the purpose of IDEA and the work they were doing to promote sustainable democracy worldwide. He pointed out that this year is the tenth anniversary of IDEA's work in democracy building, an anniversary which presented the organisation 9 446 with an opportunity to assess the variety of approaches and the emerging consensus on core ideas. IDEA's approach is non-prescriptive and is based on the belief that democracy can only be built from within to be sustainable. Their experience has also led them to provide assistance in the form of best practice examples and support attuned to national circumstances, since there are no \"one-size fits all\" solutions. Part of their work involves the assessment, measurement and analysis of democracy and its defining characteristics, since a clear understanding of these questions is critical in developing tools for democracy building. The fair and equitable funding of political parties, enhanced civic participation and voter turnout, increasing the role of women in politics, fair electoral systems and processes and voter education, codes of conduct for the political parties campaigning in elections, ethical and professional administration of elections have all been the subject of analysis and recommendation. They are also aware that democracy assistance from donor countries will only effect change at the margins unless it links these projects with broader goals such as \"good governance\" and \"the rule of law\". In addition, their work is underpinned by the view that \"no state can truly be called democratic if it offers no escape from poverty; and no country can truly develop, so long as its people are excluded from power. 3\" The Australian Electoral Commission contributes to IDEA and there is now a Democracy Audit at the Australian National University (www.democratic.audit.anu.edu.au ) which draws on many of the concepts and research findings of the international organisation and applies them to Australia. Denmark Copenhagen Meeting with Project Manager Ida-Elizabeth Andersen and Project Manager Anders Jacobi, the Danish Board of Technology. The Danish Board of Technology has adopted what appears to be a unique approach to civic participation. The Board was established to disseminate knowledge about technology, its possibilities and its effects on people, on society and the environment. It has a legislated responsibility to promote discussion about technology, to evaluate technology and advise the Danish Parliament and other government bodies about technology and its boarder effects. It reports directly to the Parliament and answers for its day to day operation to a broadly representative Board of Directors. One of its principal methods of assessment is the \"citizen technology panel\" or consensus conference which exposes groups of people to the key arguments about a specific technology and then requires them to report on its possibilities and consequences. It is, in effect, a dialogue between experts and about 14 lay people who are selected from a random sample of Danish citizens. Several such panels may be convened and usually take place over three days and are open to the public. Prior to each conference, the citizen 3 Kofi Annan, Secretary Gcncral, United Nations 10 447 panel formulates the questions and participates in the selection of experts to answer them. An advisory /planning committee has the overall responsibility for making sure that the democratic, fair and transparent processes have been followed. 4 So far, more than 20 consensus conferences have been conducted from topics ranging from irradiation of foods, the application of genetic technologies, the future of motoring, electronic surveillance and sustainable consumption. Scenario workshops are also employed to examine solutions to problems and involve a dialogue amongst policy makers, business representatives, experts and citizens. Ms Andersen made it clear that neither she nor the government regarded such techniques as substitutes for representative democracy but rather as tools to expand the range of those who contribute to decisions with a view to making better decisions. Croatia I visited Dubrovnik and Korcula (which has a sister city relationship with the City of Fremantle) as part of my responsibilities as a local member with a large group of recent as well as long-standing migrants from this region. I sought to gain an understanding of the effects of the armed conflict and human rights violations often years ago and the extent to which the people had recovered from the trauma of that conflict. I also examined the prospects for further developing the relationship between Fremantle and Korcula. Conclusion: As a result of these discussions and my observations while in Scotland and Scandinavia, in particular, I am even more convinced that the Australian Parliament is in need of substantial reform and that governments are far too complacent about the state of our democracy. Many of the problems identified in the countries I visited are far less severe than they are in Australia and the contrast in creativity, seriousness and energy with which these issues are addressed could not be sharper. I will be communicating some of the specific suggestions about Parliamentary reform to my colleagues on the Standing Committee on Procedure. I understand that in accordance with Clause 9.5 of the Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 14 of 2003, this statement may be obtained from the Special Minister of State upon request by any member or senator. I also understand that this statement may be tabled in the Parliament at the discretion of the Special Minister of State.

A subsequent funding submission will be forwarded to me, which I intend to discuss with the President and members of our Parliamentary Club. The various functions attended throughout the Convention gave wonderful opportunity to represent the Lions Club of the Australian Parliament, as well as generally supporting the work of Lions Australia. The benefits of meeting a number of senior delegates from around the world were obvious, and 1 will be strongly recommending a similar level of representation be considered for future Lions International Conventions. 450 1.

A visit reflecting my responsibilities at that time as Federal Shadow Trade Minister. I was scheduled to depart on 26 June. On 24 June, a reshuffle of Labor's Shadow Ministry was announced including my appointment as Shadow Minister for Regional Development. While I was no longer spokesperson for Trade issues, I discussed the purpose of the visit with the Labor Leader Kim Bea2ley and he was of the view that given the significance of the WTO Doha Round I should continue with it and report back to him and the Party on the issues. The final outcome of the Round will also of course have major implications for my new portfolio responsibilities regarding Regional Development in opening up new export opportunities in agriculture, manufacturing and services in regional Australia. I also contacted the Australian Embassies in the capitals I was visiting to inform them of my new portfolio responsibilities and asking them in light of that to confirm that the meetings they organised could still proceed. In all instances the response was positive. They confirmed I should go ahead with the visit, particularly as I already had an established relationship with many of the people included in the visit program. Against that background and in light of my longstanding and continuing interest in trade and economic policy, my capacity to contribute further in this area, and my new portfolio responsibilities concerning regional development, I decided to proceed with my visit as planned. Given my earlier responsibility for regional development I was also able to secure at short notice meetings on regional development issues. \u00e2\u00a2 Accordingly purpose of the visit was: \u00e2\u00a2 to build on my attendance at the Cairns Group meeting in Colombia in March/April 2005. My earlier report on that visit has been submitted. I met with the US EU Agriculture Minister and other EU officials to develop those relationships further and to get a better appreciation of the EU's objectives; 43 L \u00e2\u00a2 to understand better the function of the European Parliament and the Commission, their relationship to each other as well as the roles of the Commission. \u00e2\u00a2 to discuss with Australia's Ambassadors in Brussels and Geneva and other Australian trade officials their assessment of progress in the Doha Round and Australia's contribution to the direction of the Round, including through our Chairmanship of the Cairns Group; \u00e2\u00a2 to discuss Regional Development initiatives with Members of the European Parliament and with officials of the EU and OECD; \u00e2\u00a2 to meet with the International Labour Organisation and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) to discuss the implications arising from the Government's proposed industrial relations legislation and the issue of Labour rights, particularly in the context of the FTA the Government is pursuing with China; \u00e2\u00a2 In Singapore to meet with the APEC Secretariat to discuss inter a/ia the WTO Doha Round, regional trading arrangements and APEC issues, including preparations for APEC's hosting of APEC in 2007, as well as the Singapore Trade and Industry Minister and Australia's doing business in Singapore given previous discussions and speeches to AustCham in Singapore Itineraries and Meetings See attached. Outcomes Trade Liberalisation and the DOHA Round Following my involvement in the Cairns Group meeting in Colombia, in March it became apparent that the progress of trade negotiations in Geneva in July, ahead of and subsequent to the Mini-Ministerial meeting in Dalian, China in mid-July, would be critical in determining the extent of progress in the Doha Round at the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting in December. 454 The WTO Doha Round has been making little more than minimal progress due to a lack of commitment and political will from the key players, in particular - but certainly not only - the US and the EU. Intransigence from Japan, Switzerland and India has created further problems. Accompanying the WTO talks at officials level in Geneva have been high level international meetings which could have provided much needed political momentum, but unfortunately have failed to do so when opportunities presented themselves. Discussion at the GB Summit at Gleneagles, UK, in early July included progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and the trade and aid debate with specific reference to Africa, out of which came further debt forgiveness and direct aid to Africa. I used the opportunity to argue that as difficult an issue poverty is in Africa, there are huge poverty issues as well in Asia and in our region. An important breakthrough on debt forgiveness was agreed between Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W Bush in the lead up to the Gleneagles GB Summit. It was essential for the WTO (given DOHA is known as the Development Round) to impress upon this meeting of leaders not Just the need to look beyond Africa but also to understand that as important as aid is, by far the bigger benefits to sustained economic growth can be realised for these developing nations through genuine trade liberalisation. The GB Summit also provided the opportunity for a dramatic breakthrough, especially between the US and the EU. President Bush took the opportunity to put US domestic agriculture subsidies on the negotiating table offering to abolish them if the EU were to do likewise. With Prime Minister Blair also Chair of the GB and the UK recently pushing its EU partners to reduce expenditure on agriculture support President Bush's offer was particularly timely. Unfortunately however, the EU was not able to respond in a positive fashion to the US offer and the opportunity for much needed political stimulus to the Doha process was lost. This was another setback for the Doha Round. 4SS Following Gleneagles, Trade Ministers met at a mini ministerial meeting in Dalian, China providing an opportunity to get the Round back on track. A key focus of this meeting was the need to make significant progress on agriculture, in particular getting agreement to modalities relating to tariff cuts on agriculture including the formula to determine the size and scope of such Cuts. Notwithstanding, that time is running out. Ministers were unable to reach agreement on this point or the method for phasing out domestic subsidies - another setback for the Round. With Ministers unable to agree on these threshold issues, discussion moved back to Geneva with officials - and some Ministers - holding further talks at the end of July. Without strong political support and direction the Geneva talks held slim prospects of a breakthrough. The dynamics were further complicated by the demands on the US Trade Representative Michael Portman to ensure the passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement through US Congress. This was occupying a great deal of Ambassador Portman's time reducing the US's capacity to move on important areas of the Round. Without movement by the US the EU was not in a position to move. In the event, the end of July Geneva talks also proved a disappointment, failing to make the much needed critical breakthrough on agriculture which remains central to a successful conclusion to the WTO Round. Against that backdrop, my visit provided me with the opportunity to discuss in detail the views, perspectives and prospects of the Round with EU officials, including the EU Commissioner for Agriculture Fischer Boel, the Director-General Designate of the WTO, Pascal Lamy, and other WTO officials, including the Chairman of the Agriculture Negotiating Group, Tim Groser and various Ambassadors to Geneva including those representing the Five Important Nations, Five Interested Parties (FIPS) group. Consistent with a Status Report he presented to WTO Members on 27 June, Tim Groser, as Chair of the Agriculture Negotiating Group outlined the key issues he believed needed to be in place by the end of July. These were the following; \u00e2\u00a2 In the domestic support pillar, the structure of the reduction commitments (not the size of the reductions) relating to Trade Distorting Domestic Support. 4 456 \u00e2\u00a2 In the export competition pillar, further elaboration of associated issues including state trading enterprises, which has implications for the Australian Wheat Board, and Food Aid. \u00e2\u00a2 In the market access pillar, the structure of at least some elements of the tariff reduction formula and associated flexibilities, including 'sensitive products', an area of major concern to Australia as it may be the loophole for the EU, US, Japan and others to exclude key items such as sugar, beef and rice from tariff cuts. While a lot of the focus of the Doha Round has been on the agricultural negotiations there are other important elements offering potentially significant gains for Australian business, particularly in services, and manufacturing exports. Unfortunately, the difficulties encountered with the agriculture negotiations have spilled over to the other areas of negotiation. Without a breakthrough on agriculture the rest of the agenda will remain deadlocked. In his report to WTO Members on 28 July, the WTO Director General as Chair of the Trade Negotiations Committee, noted in terms of arriving at a tariff formula for industrials that 'some Members do not want to discuss numbers without first having a defined structure, while other Members have problems discussing the structure without first having the numbers. This \"chicken and egg\" situation has been impeding progress.' As the Director General added, \"This vicious circle can only be broken 0 Members proceed with the necessary conditional trust and show a genuine willingness to negotiate.\" While there has been some progress on services, with 68 initial and 24 revised offers being submitted, the overall quality of offers remains low. According to the Director General, few if any provide new business opportunities to service suppliers. And most Members feel that the negotiations are no progressing as well as they should. One of the problems with the Doha Round is the over-loaded agenda. In addition to the above matters other issues being negotiated include WTO Rules, Trade Facilitation, Environment, Intellectual Property and Geographical Indications (GIs). GIs are being pursued by the EU to 457 protect products based on their geographical point of production i.e. Champagne. Australia is opposed to the extension of GIs as it has the potential to undermine any gains that may be made on agricultural market access. This matter was raised with me in my meeting with the EU Agriculture Commissioner and it is apparent that the EU will push hard on this issue. As noted above, the end of July Geneva meetings failed to make the necessary breakthroughs on all of these key areas before the European Summer holiday period in August. I understand work will continue in Geneva in some areas however this is likely to be perfunctory at best, losing valuable time before the Hong Kong Ministerial meeting in December. In his final report to the WTO's Trade Negotiations Committee on 28 July 2005, Tim Grosser suggested that the negotiations could restart after the summer break with political decisions that would enable a successful ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December. While the necessary decisions can be identified they will be difficult to progress. Groser added that the biggest problems remain in market access, followed by some issues in domestic support. Export competition has progressed furthest although some outstanding issues remain. Not only was the first half of this year a lost opportunity but the talks have now reached the point where the agenda for Hong Kong could be so overloaded as to be unwieldy, risking a Cancun type collapse of the talks if Ministers are unable to reach agreement on the many outstanding matters. As pessimistic as this may all sound at this stage, the talks are not doomed to tail at Hong Kong in December. Success is possible but it will be hard. As outlined in the above, there has been a frustrating lack of leadership by the key players. While the US made the encouraging offer on domestic subsidies the EU was not prepared to spend the political capital to positively respond. But notwithstanding its offer, the US has been distracted and restricted in its approach by the passage of CAFTA. It is to be hoped that the passage of CAFTA will now give the US sufficient flexibility to revive the Round. The new Director General, Pascal Lamy, known for his negotiating skills, also takes over in September. Much will hinge on the ability of Messrs Lamy, Portman and Mandelson (EU Trade Commissioner). 458 From Australia's point of view, the emergence of the G20 has overshadowed the traditional role of the Cairns Group as the moderating Third force' in the WTO talks. The G20 has taken the initiative with a tariff cutting proposal that has not been rejected by any of the major players and offers some prospect of overcoming the impasse on export access. This years APEC Ministerial Meetings and Leaders' Summit in Korea provide another opportunity to make further progress on the Round, and hopefully take some of the load, before the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting. In my discussion with a Senior Korean official at the APEC Secretariat in Singapore I was advised that Korea is planning to hold another WTO mini-ministerial meeting before the Summit. Participation in such a meeting would go beyond APEC members to include the EU and other important players in the Round. This is a welcome initiative and just as APEC provided an initiative to break an impasse in the Uruguay round so too this meeting could provide for a similar initiative for the DOHA round. Regional Australia has a lot riding on a successful outcome of the Doha Round Reqional Development On regional development issues it was instructive to be updated on the approach of the EU, particularly in the context of the enlargement of the EU. The EU has committed more than \u00e2\u00ac200 billion from 2000 to 2006 in regional initiatives for the 15 original members of the EU. A further \u00e2\u00ac23 billion (from 2004/06) has been committed to fund programs for new members consequent upon decisions to enlarge the membership. The funding is to promote sustainable economic growth and employment. Specifically targeting areas of regional disadvantage, particularly infrastructure, R&D, education and training. This policy approach has been hugely successful in the case of Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece. In these countries the measure of success has been not only an increasing GOP per capita, but a narrowing of the GDP per capita disparity in the EU. In the case of Ireland GDP per capita has doubled in the last 10 years. 4S') Enlargement has produced its own difficulties for the EU. This is evidenced by the recent referendum rejection of a new Constitution by France and the Netherlands. The politics of these circumstances were fascinating to observe. As was the debate about the Budget of the EU currently stalled and the rotation to the UK of the EU Chair. Prime Minister Blair had lust addressed the European Parliament throwing down the challenge to reform the Budget. Given the huge amount spent on the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) some 40% of the total EU budget progress on this issue has a bearing on the funding for agricultural support in Europe, and therefore implications for the EU's position to who WTO round. Despite these political and Budget difficulties the EU is still focussed on growth and jobs and the role of regional policy is seen as critical to that success. The renewed focus on regions aims for the better integration of local and community priorities into national and regional development programs. There is also a realisation that greater ownership at the local level of the programs and policy is crucial and they are looking at ways to better involve the stakeholders. Assuming Budget difficulties are resolved the EC has rewritten the regional guidelines in preparation for enlargement. The new guidelines target 3 areas: 1. A requirement for both urban and regional programs to improve accessibility, ensure an adequate level of services and to ensure their environmental potential. 2. To foster the growth of a knowledge economy by programs to invest in human capital and support innovation, skills and research, with a special focus on new information and communication technologies. 3. Job creation and the promotion of entrepreneurship as well as the better adaptability of workers and enterprises. The aim is to use the new focus of the program to strike the balance between sustained growth for jobs and social cohesion. s 460 Despite some obvious differences - our vast geography and dispersed population for one - Australia faces many similar challenges. Our cities and regions are diverse. A Our larger cities are more connected to the knowledge economy than ever before, but have great diversity within them with disadvantage persisting in many communities. Our smaller state and territory capitals are developing not only their own economic strengths, but are also forging their own identities and positioning in the global economy. Similarly, our regional centres are not only the hubs of regional economies, providing critical higher-level services in areas such as education and health. They have been transformed over the past 20 years, with the growth of both their economies and a wider range of lifestyle opportunities. And people living in our smaller regional and rural communities, and our remote areas, still face the perennial struggle to keep upon the basic infrastructure and service levels that all Australians should be entitled to. Meeting the needs of such diverse places requires a carefully considered approach to policy. At the heart of this must be the effort to ensure that all regions can sustain higher levels of economic and jobs growth - to ensure that the benefits of prosperity are widely shared. Australians, no matter where they live, should enjoy: - access to economic and job opportunities, which in turn requires quality, affordable infrastructure and a strong skills base; - a decent level of the essential services that we all rely on to live good lives and get ahead; - a voice in the decisions that affect their future. Ensuring that our regions can sustain higher levels of economic growth to create job opportunities is a key challenge for Australia. I will be focussing on how to improve the infrastructure of our regions and the services to its people. There are a number of ways to finance that infrastructure and service delivery and invest in our regions. There is a crucial role for Government in this agenda. 9 461 I will have more to say about how we improve infrastructure and Services in our regions in the context of the lelstra debate, And I am particularly interested in the new ways we can empower our regions - give local people a stronger sense of ownership in shaping their own futures. I remember fondly my time as Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Through the Working Nation' initiative, responsibility and program money was devolved to the regions themselves through Area Consultative Committees. The aim was to better match labour supply and demand enabling the communities to undertake skills audits ensuring delivery of relevant training programs to match the needs of the local industry. It it can be done for employment and training programs, why not other areas involving Government programs and service delivery? Almost a decade later, why do we still have the duplication of programs and policies between three levels of government? The ACC structure still exists, and I will be looking at how we can build on it to give meaningful voice to our regions. There are some important lessons from the EU and OECD on these issues which I will be further considering. Better Governance in our Reqion Whilst at the OECD I also met with the directorate responsible for Public Governance and Territorial Development. I was interested in this area as a follow up to the Conference on Governance and Development I attended on behalf of the Australian Parliament in June. That conference was sponsored by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the World Bank Institute. A copy of the Report of that Conference has been separately provided to the Parliament. It was interesting that the OECD is considering the related issues of reform of the civil service, corruption, the rule of law and the judiciary, proper budgeting procedures and E-Government amongst other things, with a specific focus on North Africa and the Middle East. 10 462 I strongly argued that the OECD consider taking a broader focus and look at these issues in the context of our region. I suggested APEC might be a useful forum through which to build such a focus, given the membership of APEC (developed and developing nations, members and non member OECD), as well as it being the fastest growing economic region in the world necessitating and providing a different urgency to the governance issue. This was a theme I pursued with the APEC secretariat in Singapore and it is something I intend to pursue with my political colleagues in Australia. This issue of ensuring better governance is also crucial in the context of debt forgiveness and the case for increased aid debate. Given the growth of supra national bodies it is important to understand better the various models. What works, what doesn't. I have long found to be invaluable the exchanges of ideas on the experience of others in international setting. Australia can play a leadership role in the region. In particular it needs to focus more on the ongoing role of APEC and specifically what can be done to improve governance in the region and closer to home in the Pacific. This could build on the initiatives suggested in a Senate report under the Chairmanship of former Senator Peter Cook which included a number of recommendations including the establishment of a Pacific Forum. APEC I also visited the APEC Secretariat which since 2003 is located on the campus of the Institute of South East Asian Studies. I Whilst other regional groupings have emerged in our region, such as ASEAN plus 3 and Australia has just been invited to the East Asian Summit in December, APEC, in my view, still holds the greatest potential. It meets annually with Heads of Government as well as other ministerial forums in the lead up. It involves 21 countries on the Pacific Rim the fastest growing economic region. It involves ii 463 developed and developing countries, in particular a balance of countries with which Australia has enjoyed very good relations over a long period of time. We were a foundation member of APEC and a driving force in its establishment. We used it to give further impetus to the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation by establishing the Bogor declaration, a further timetable for regional trade liberalisation. In other words, a regional approach consistent with multilateral principles. More recently it has been an important forum for the strategy to defeat terrorism and for dealing with response to natural disasters such as the Tsunami. Australia hosts APEC in 2007. It joins the secretariat next year to prepare for it and it enjoys an executive officer position for the next 3 years. We should be identifying the sorts of outcomes we want to achieve in 2007. One issue is how APEC now sees its role in the context of the other regional groupings which have either emerged or enlarged in the region. On the continuing reform program, the APEC 2007 meeting will need to deal with applicants for membership of APEC and 9 countries including India have sought to join. This will involve APEC having to deal with its own enlargement agenda. We should also look to the decision making process of APEC and whether consensus decisions only should be taken. The WTO for example has a determination capacity (under Article 9). We should also look at whether decisions should be binding. Clearly there are some sensitivities to be addressed but the issues need to be canvassed and the case for reform pushed. In the context of progress on the Bogor declaration whilst the issue of the timetable is important, so too is an assessment to why better progress was made on goods than services and what needs to be done to improve progress given the great opportunities in trade in services. 12 We need also to look at how APEC can complement a successful outcome to the DOHA round in the same way as the Bogor declaration complemented the Uruguay round. Alternatively if the DOHA round does not result in a successful outcome APEC presents the next best multilateral solution. Either way APEC needs to adopt a new urgency not just for trade liberalisation but capital flows and investment flows. In this context it is more essential to give a greater role to the economic Ministers in the lead up to the 2007 APEC meeting. We should heed recent lessons of the Asian financial crash and take more of a lead role in insisting on better governance both from Governments and Financial institutions in the region. We need to understand the importance of good governance for developing countries and look to ways in which aid is better applied to more sustained and open systems of Government. We need to look at a better interaction and representational status for the stakeholders in particular APEC's Business Advisory Council (ABAC). 13 465 This Page Is InterItRu!Iy Left Blank 466 SENATOR JOHN WATSON 467 I OVERSEAS STUDY REPORT - VISIT TO LONDON, TORONTO AND DES MOINES JUNE - JULY 2005 Australia, the UK, USA and Canada follow similar economic policies. Given my interest in these matters, my overseas study tour involved meetings in London, Toronto and Des Moines, USA Singapore. The purpose of the overseas study tour was to observe and compare outcomes in the first three countries with respect to: 1. economic and inflationary issues, and 2. overview pensions, savings and taxation issues. London The Bank of England had concerns about a slow down in global demand and the impact of rising oil prices. (I) Inflation There was some criticism in the local press in London that the Bank of England's focus on high home prices was to the neglect of inflation issues. The same may be said of Australia's Reserve Bank although the final outcome in Australia of raising interest rates has been to quieten the economy in some areas and to put a lid on property prices particularly in Sydney. (ii) Tax and Superannuation A recent OECD report suggests that Australia should discriminate against lump sums and make it easier to work part-time for older citizens. The report further stated that Australia lagged behind many other industrialised countries in the number of older people who had jobs and more needed to be done to meet the challenges of an ageing population. The report was not all that dissimilar to the Report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation of several years, a report widely drawn upon by the Productivity Commission that acknowledged the need to get older people back into work and to otherwise improve the attractiveness of taking an income stream compared to a lump sum. 468 (iii) Country Pensions Comparison Australia has a robust public/private pension environment with the three pillar policy of:- 1. age pension; 2. tax concessions for retirement products; and 3. employer support through the compulsory Superannuation Guarantee arrangements. (iv) British Pension Concerns A radical overhaul is acknowledged by some to avert a crisis of the potential of millions of Britons living in future poverty. Certainly Britons in future could well be retiring on less than their parents. A 20 year policy of reducing the generosity of the Defined Benefit Pension system on the notion that voluntary savings designed around price will bridge the gap has not worked. The conclusion is to get the price high enough to be attractive to industry and low enough to attract the consumer. This notion is similar to the Australian situation affecting complying annuities. Britain like many other European countries is facing a dilemma of an ailing pension regime. The Government has appointed an independent chairman, Mr Adair Turner to head the Pensions Commission. Challenges include:- 1. Shortfall in voluntary savings; 2. The price/return ratio for providers and consumers; 3. Gaps in the Regulator's jurisdiction; 4. Many middle size corporations fail to have an independent custodian holding assets; 5. Shortfall in funding levels; 6. No standard employer support. Observations 1. Commentators have suggested the Chairman favours a New Zealand model of \"opting out'. This policy from Australia's perspective will not provide a long term solution. 2. Australia has a good framework for superannuation that is sustainable but nonetheless needs stronger government tax 469 concessional support by way of income tax deductions for individuals. (v) There are hundreds of Australians working in the financial services sector in London. The attractions appear to be: 1. Professional advancement; and 2. High marginal Australian tax rates. The budget tax savings in Australia reduce the middle to upper income tax brackets more in line with the OECD average. This measure will in the longer term encourage many such individuals to return to Australia. (vi) Publications Exchange The UK Treasury officials were particularly interested in:- \u00e2\u00a2 the co-contribution budget initiatives for low income earners; \u00e2\u00a2 Measures to retain older workers in employment; \u00e2\u00a2 Encouragement of after tax savings; \u00e2\u00a2 The abolition of the surcharge; and \u00e2\u00a2 The introduction of Choice. Following my visit I submitted six Australian Government Publications focussing on Centrelink payments and taxation. Conclusion 1. While in the UK I was asked to submit a report to the Pensions Committee based on my Australian experience with the Senate Select Commission on Superannuation. 2. Australia has not inherited many of the problems of the UK defined benefit and related pension schemes. 3. Australia needs to work harder on getting older people back to the workforce and lessening the tax burden on income stream products. Meetings in London 1. Mercers London, Simon O'Regan, Timothy Keogh, Jo-Anne Bloch, Human Relations Division; 2. Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre; 3 3. Shadow Minister of State for Works and Pensions, Sir Malcolm Rifkind; 4. Australian High Commissioner Richard Alston; 5. Team for Savings and Investments Product division of Her Majesty's Treasury - Paul Kirkham Team Leader, Tom Springbett, Peter Green Capital Markets Governance plus other employees from Personal Income and Earnings, Asset Savings and Wealth Teams; 6. Bank of England Publications Research and Inflation Report; and 7. House of Commons visit and discussions with Commonwealth officials. Principal Financial Group, Des Moines, USA The Principal Financial Group is the largest USA provider of 401(k) plans. It has rated consistently high for awards in product design and member communications. The presentations, as attached, were around four main topics:- 1. General overview and trends in the US pension market; 2. Principal Financial Group's involvement and vision of the pension market; 3. Principal's latest product developments in facing these trends (Retirement Income Solutions, Total Retirement suite); and 4. Keys to success in the US pension business. Canada The Financial Services Industry while larger than its counterpart and is well regulated has many similarities with Australia. Meeting with Hon Thomas A. Hockin, former Canadian Finance Minister and President-CEO, Investment Funds Institute of Canada. Other Comments from Singapore 1. There was some surprise that Australia intended to scale back its ambitious plans for a global cross trading platform because of a low initial response from investors. 4 471 2. The average person in Asia saves more than their US or European equivalent. 3. The Japanese who are getting older wish to secure higher than zero interest rates on bank deposits. Of all the larger fund groups only Fidelity of the USA plans a major expansion in the Australian market. Others generally look to Australia as a boutique provider. Since my return to Australia and as a result of my observations while I was away, I have put in a submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration in relation to its enquiry on Improving the Superannuation Savings of People Under Age 40. I have also had discussions with members of the financial services industry here in Australia. Further, I have been invited to put in a submission to the British Pensions Commission headed by Mr Adair Turner, which I shall attend to as soon as possible.

I proposed to travel to Italy via London and examine the country's Migration laws and systems. In particular, I stated that I would visit and examine the Italian system of detention for illegal arrivals. I also welcomed the opportunity to observe the Guest Work Program Italy currently operates. As well as being of great interest I felt it would be very informative in my role as the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration in the Australian Federal Parliament. Secondly, I stated that I would examine the institutions in Perugia and Florence - which are world renowned as \"Foreign Language Schools\". There has been much interest on these schools in my electorate, at a secondary school level. I had the opportunity to examine the curriculum, to attend the university and the opportunity to view its operation first hand which would be of great interest to many in my electorate of Canning, as Italian is deemed to be the largest identifiable ethnic group by origin. I confirmed that it was my intention that my wife Julie accompanies me on this study exercise. Since advising you of my overseas study journey, I can confirm that no changes were made to the original purpose. LOCALITIES INCLUOC A_4dIiZ. I.nj,4d,i. . 10w Law. - JULY 2005 I left Perth on QF15. I arrived in Rome the next day after transiting through Singapore and London's Heathrow Airports. From Rome's Fulminco Airport, I took a bus to Perugia. My wife and I have taken a lease on an apartment in Perugia for the thirty days of our stay in Italy. Perugia will be the base for our stay as it is very central in Italy. It is also the regional capital of Umbria. It is also the location of Italy's most respected foreign language school. Namely, the Universatary per Stranieri de Perugia for foreign students. It is internationally recognised as such. (I will go into more detail about this Universatary later in this report) 6 JULY 2005 I visited another town in the Umbrian region called Assissi. Assissi is more famous for St Francis of Assissi; however it also has a well respected Foreign Language School. A constituent Mrs Young asked me to locate and make contact with this school as she intends to enrol in the next few months. I did this and met with relevant officals.after gathering relevant data; I took a number of photos and returned to Perusia. 8 JULY 2005 My wife and I travelled to Venice. We stayed at hotel Mabapa on Lido Island. We visited many relevant museums and of course the famous Murano Glass Factory. 11 JULY 2005 I took the bus from Perugia to Rome for many intensive meetings and briefings associated with the reasons for my study leave. While in Rome, I stayed at Hotel La Griffe. This hotel is very central and therefore convenient to my meeting venues. 12 JULY 2005 I attended several meetings at the Australian Embassy in Rome. Please see further information relating to the outcomes of these meetings in the next section. I visited Rome's Detention Centre. Please see further information relating to the outcome of this visit in the next section. 13 JULY 2005 I attended several meetings at the Migration Ministry. Please see further information relating to the outcomes of these meetings in the next section. 14-28 JULY 2005 Based in Perugia where I was able to observe the function and operation of L'Universita per Stranieri di Perugia. 30 JULY 2005 We boarded flight BA55 I in Rome and arrived back in Perth the next day after transiting once again through London's Heathrow and Singapore Airports. KEY MEETINGS AND OUTCOMES/FINDINGS: Tuesday 12th July Australian Embassy I had an appointment to call on His Excellency, Mr Peter Woolcott, the Australian Ambassador to Rome. In the time spent we discussed a range of relevant issues, ranging from; \u00e2\u00a2 Trade (Including the role of Aust Trade) \u00e2\u00a2 Immigration issues \u00e2\u00a2 Workplace Relations Reforms both in Italy and Australia - Terrorism and the ltalio-Australion cooperation \u00e2\u00a2 General political topics of mutual interest. I also had the pleasure of meeting other members of the Australian mission in Rome. These included; \u00e2\u00a2 Angus McKenzie (DHOM) \u00e2\u00a2 Teresa Pilosi (Research Officer) \u00e2\u00a2 Paul Garwood (Interpreter and Research Officer) I then visited Dott. Giuseppe De Cicco . He is the Head of Directorate for the Protection of Working Conditions. I was accompanied by Paul Garwood as both interpreter and some one who has a special knowledge of such matters. Dott. Dc Cicco had presented an array of advisers and specialists in the area of Workplace Relations. Our detailed and extensive discissions ranged over many topics related to this area. These included; The role of Trade Unions in the Italian work force and how this compares with the Australian experience. I was provided with raw figures which reflect current union membership \u00e2\u00a2 CGIL (Confederazione Generale italiana del Lavoro) 5,522,557 cardholders 2004 \u00e2\u00a2 CISIL (Confederazione Italiana Sindacati Lavoratori) 4,260,937 cardholders 2004 \u00e2\u00a2 UlL (Unione Italiana Lavoro) 1,915,237 cardholders at end of 2004 - There is no formal role for Unions in the Italian Constitution - There are three (3) major unions in Italy. They are not industry based but rather ideologically and politically based. - Smaller unions tend to be more militant so as to be heard - There is a 'right to strike' in the Italian constitution. - Civil Courts decide on the merits of a strike. These decisions then set a precedent. - Although the current employment rate was believed to be about 9% there was no supporting data. There was a suggestion such figures are not accurate due to the \"black economy.\" 476 Casualisation and Workforce Flexibility: - The Biagi Reforms. This is new legislation to bring into legislation the legitimism of casual work as a practice and as such provide more opportunity and security for casual workers. The motive is as in Australia to provide a more flexible workforce. These reforms are also intended to bring the black market workforce into the official job market and the Taxation regime. It was also stated that the cost of Labour in Italy is generally higher than most other European countries. Unfair Dismissal Laws: - Until recently, it was almost impossible to dismiss an employee. In fact, if the court ruled that an employee was not to be dismissed that person basically had the right to a job for life as long as the business remained in business. - Recently, a law was passed to try and address this type of paralysis. It is called Article 18. This is directed at businesses with 15 employees or less. - Unfortunately, the results so far indicate that it are meeting with little success. Our hosts agreed that they would like the opportunity to institute the Workplace reforms that Australia has introduced and the further reforms being proposed. Guest Workers - Stated that as it was not their area of expertise, they declined to comment. Recognition of Qualifications - This aspect is currently being addressed through the European Union. However, it was inferred that Italy has been tardy in reaching agreed timetables on these issues. As an aside, those present don't believe that Italy has a shortage of workers as they can either obtain labour from the south or the ability to attract workers from other EU countries or new EU countries always provides as solution for them. 13th July 2005 Detention Centre This centre is called\" Centro di Temporanea Permanenza.\" It is operated by the Interior Ministry in conjunction with the Red Cross. It is located at Via Portuense, Lee. Ponte Galena. After a lengthy taxi ride and much confusion as to wether I had permission to enter, I finally gained access to this centre. (The Embassy assures me that they had conformation of this visit for the time that I arrived) I was provided with a delightful interpreter who was American born but of Italian heritage. We were given an extensive tour by the two medical doctors in attendance. I was shown both the male and the female cells and yards. I was also conducted to the cafeteria, the mess, the interview rooms and the medical facilities. 477 There is much that could be said of an almost three hour visit. However, I will provide the following points and expand on them if required. - At the time of the visit there were 145 male detainees and 184 female. - The centre was at capacity - Detainees are brought to the centre by the police - No detainee is held for more than 60 days. This is the law in Italy. - Most detainees are before the courts within the week. - If a detainee successfully secures refugee status, they are then released to pursue this class of visa. - There is only ONE determination before a civil court - As few are successful, the rest are counselled, receive health and dental treatment and are then released' on foot' and told to leave the country in 5 days. If they do not leave Italy, they are detained once more and the process starts all over again. Theoretically this can happen ad infinitam. The majority of detainees are from eastern European countries. Other sources are Sri Lanka, and Africa. Tripoli is the staging point for African illegal arrivals. The majority of women are detained because they operate as prostitutes. Romanians provide the bulk of these female detainees. There is little unrest or violence at the centre. Detainees are entitled to regular visitors. I also met with the chief of Police who provide the security for the detention centre. He was a fascinating man from Napoli. He was very hospitable and forthcoming in his views. His views can also be summarised as follows: - The police are there to assist rather than act harshly. - There have few escapes. - The Police act with regional police to identify illegal arrivals. - They also work with \"Reception Centres\" in the regions to gather illegal arrivals. They also work with a range of foreign diplomats very closely to encourage the removal of illegal entrants there is a view that this relationship with foreign diplomats delivers positive outcomes in the ability to return illegal arrivals to their countries of origin. The police work closely with regional police to \"harass\" those who have been given the 5 days to leave. He stated that this method was generally quite successful. He was also aware that Tripoli in Libya was the staging point for people smugglers of African origin. He believed that few knew what they were coming to and had been deceived by fanciful stories about what awaited them. Consequently, many were keen to return once detained as often they received a free trip to their country of origin. He was unconcerned by the fact that so many illegal arrivals were in Italy as he believed they posed little in the way of a security threat. Finally, (tongue in cheek) he believed that Italy was obliged to demonstrate a soft approach to illegal arrivals because \"Italy was the home of the Pope!\" I learned much from my open and uninhibited access to this detention centre. It centre is one of four of in Italy. 478 13th July 2005 Ministry of Foreign Affairs While in Rome I also visited members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Firstly, I visited; Counsellor Nicola Letter. He was an expert on issues connected with visas and policy in relation to the Italians Governments visas administration. Discussion and information was provided around the following points: - The many types and sub- classes of visas. - The difference and qualifications between visitors an working visas - Spousal visas - Those with dual citizen ship - The entitlements of refugees - The also have protection visas - The entitlements of children born to non citizens.(basically they have few) - The conditions to become an Italian citizen. Either due to marriage, invitation or because you have become an eminent person. There is generally little encouragement for the provision to become a new Italian citizen. There are many conditions under which a guest worker can come to Italy. i.e. They must have a job to go to. Their permit is annually renewable. Regions can sponsor certain types of skilled workers. They have the time of the remainder of their permit to find another job. - There are seasonal permits (Mainly for new countries) - There are Non Seasonal (2 year permits) - If successful, after 10 years they can apply for a Residence Card - Those with a residence card can sponsor family members. - Family card holders can sponsor parents if they satisfy the' balance of family test.' Those aged 65 plus can apply for a \"Family Cohesion\" visa. If the family can't support them financially, then the State will. * In approximately five year intervals Italy offers a moratorium on illegal arrivals. In Italy's 2002 moratorium about 700 000 illegal migrants presented for clemency. Most of those were given legal status and work permits. Interestingly about 10000 were found to be Ukrainians. It is thought that this may tend to justify the large quotas offered by Italy for work permits. Certain countries have Readmittance Agreements in addition to specifically agreed quotas with those counties. (For example, Albania, Sri Lanka.) These cordial arrangements tend to control to some extent the ebb and flow of illegal arrivals. In addition to the agreed quotas, there is also in place agreements for specialist workers. These arrangements generally last for the duration of the contract or the life of the project. 479 Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Councellor Carlo Perroua. His title was \"Coordinator of Policy for the Ministries of Migration, Interior and Labour.\" Having met with Councellor Perrotta, I was able to confirm much of Councellor Leners information to me. - He confirmed the Official quotas for Aliens' - He confirmed the length of stay for seasonal workers - He outlined again the relationship between the rules for EU and non EU countries and 'new EU' countries. Councillor Perrotta also confirmed the Guest Worker rules and entitlements under the law as it stands. He reiterated that after ten years a Guest Worker can seek a Residency Visa. The longer a Guest Worker stays and merges with the community and the workforce, the better is the opportunity for that worker to receive an n indefinite visa. On Refugees, once they have had their preliminary hearing, they are either given protection under UN Article 51 or removed if found not to be genuine. This hearing again takes place within days or a few months. * Politics and the Church do not support the practice of Mandatory Detention! Of the 50000 Guest Workers, the following is the quota of non EU and New EU countries. The 20 500 are broken down from countries as follows. \u00e2\u00a2 3 000 Albanians \u00e2\u00a2 3000 Tunisians \u00e2\u00a2 2 500 Moroccans \u00e2\u00a2 1 500 500 Moldavians \u00e2\u00a2 l500 Bangladeshis \u00e2\u00a2 1 000 Pakistanis \u00e2\u00a2 2500 Non EU or new EU countries. Central Commission for the Recognition of Refugee Status: I met with both the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of this august body. An interpreter was provided. This is a Government body. It is staffed by selected Public Servants. These appointees have some expertise in this area and also receive good professional support from expert officers. They need this advice as they receive a huge number who apply for refugee status on an annual basis. I will attach a statistical sheet of data on Refugees kept since 1990. However, the summary of data for 2004 (the latest figures) is as follows. 480 Of the 122 725 applications for Refugee status, \u00e2\u00a2 80655 were rejected \u00e2\u00a2 21 639 disappeared \u00e2\u00a2 8 051 received a protection visa to be renewed annually ( but not asylum) \u00e2\u00a2 ii 821 were successful and \u00e2\u00a2 559 returned to their countries of origin voluntary. Those present thought the Australian system to be highly desirable and demonstrated some envy for our accurate record keeping and strong legislative support. Italy does not have an official Refugee programme linked to the UNHCR as Australia does. As can be seen, only some 11% succeed in gaining Refugee status. Italy unofficially assists the majority who do not succeed to continue their journey north to such countries as Germany where the welfare state is encouraging and accommodating of such migrants. International Organization for Migration: I had the pleasure of meeting with Ms Carmela Godeau the Deputy Chief Administrative Officer with ON \u2014Italy. She is of Italian origin but has served in many OEM posts, particularly in the Middle East. Her previous posting before Rome was in Syria. The ON is the principal intergovernmental organization in migration. Australia is a member state. It was established in 1951. OlM is dedicated to promoting humane and orderly migration for the benefit of all. It does so by providing services and advice to governments and migrants. The OlM currently has 112 member states and growing. It also has 23 Observer States currently. It has an annual budget of over $800 million (US) and has over 1 200 active programmes employing more than 5 000 staff members in more than 210 field officers in over 100 countries. Ms Godeau outlined to me that OEM works in four main areas of migration management; \u00e2\u00a2 Migration and development \u00e2\u00a2 Facilitating migration \u00e2\u00a2 Regulating Migration \u00e2\u00a2 Addressing forced migration The OEM examines \"push factors\" and \"pull factors.\" For example, the changing needs of industrialized countries need both skilled and non skilled migrants. In this area OlM provides Governments with policy and technical advice on the regulation of migrant labour and other migratory movements. 481 In this area it also assists Governments in selection and recruitment. These services also extend to assistance with language, cultural orientation, consular services, training, reception, integration and the return of those appropriate. It has also provided over 1.5 million immigration medical evaluations and provides travel and logistical requirements for migrants. The OIMs goal is to replace the irregular flows with orderly regular flows which are in the best interest of both migrants and governments. The OIM is active in assisting refugees during and after emergencies such as East Timor and Kosovo. It is regularly asked to help find solutions for internally displaced persons (IDPs) it also assists militia and victims of ethnic cleansing (Rwanda) and populations in transition. (Ethiopia) One interesting function is its programmes and acknowledged expertise in post war claims and compensation. For example, it is still involved in post WW 2 claims against Germany. Finally, the OIM is strengthening its role and expertise in the field of Migration Law. As a consultative and policy forum, it is now seen as one of the world authorities in this field. In fact, the OIM Councils International Dialogue on Migration is accepted as the principal international forum for intergovernmental migration policy debate. I was rather impressed with the local and global role of the OIM and as a result I will be seeking to invite this body to appear before the Joint Standing Committee on Migration in the Australian Parliament. Our current term of reference would be an ideal forum for members of this organization to appear. 14-28 July 2005 L'UnIversita per Stranlerl di Perugia At the beginning of this report I began by indicating that one of the objectives of this study trip was to investigate the opportunities for those wishing to learn Italian as a second language or those of Italian heritage, or simply ordinary Australians wishing to update or refine their language skills to do so. I also indicated that I had visited Assisi where an excellent Italian language course is offered. In fact, there are numerous towns and cities in Italy where such foreign language courses operate. Florence is another famous city where such a well credentialed course is on offer. You will also note that I have visited Florence. However, the 'supremo' of all such courses is offered in the Provincial capital of Umbria, the city of Perugia. It is for this reason that I based myself in Perugia for the duration of my time in Italy. In 1921, an Umbrian lawyer, named Astoree Lupattelli set up the first of such courses in Perugia. He did so for the promotion of his cherished Umbrian region, its history, its culture and of course of great significance to the culture is the romantic language which is Italian. 482 As an aside, the city of Perugia has been well in existence since before the 6' century BC. It was conquered by the Romans during the 3fl century BC and has been the focus of a colourful history during medieval times, the Papal wars and plays a significant role in contempory regional politics today. In 1927, The University for Foreigners as it became known established itself in its now permanent location at the Plazzo Gallenga in the centre of the old city of Perugia. The Plazzo Gallenga is an historic mansion, once owned by one of the wealthiest and powerful families of the region but that rich history is yet another story. The Palazzo Gallenga may be the universities head quarters but it now operates on several campus sites in and around the city of Perugia due to the huge demand, because of its international recognition and the vast array of options that this university now offers. While in Perugia I have been a regular visitor to the university campus and its head quarters. I have met with administrators such as Ms Lucia Corsor and teachers in the university. I have also had many opportunities to meet with the many students with varied backgrounds who attend this highly successful international institution. The positive response by administrators, teachers and students is obviously why this University and its courses are held in such high regard not only in Italy but internationally. The Universita per Stranieri de Perugia has recently been recognized as a university in its own right. It consists of a Faculty of Italian language and Culture and Department of Science of Language and comparative Cultures. Besides Italian Language and Cultural Courses the University carries out the following four Degree Courses (at 3 levels) to both foreigners and Italians alike. \u00e2\u00a2 Degree in Teaching Italian Culture and Language to Foreigners \u00e2\u00a2 Specialization Degree in Italian Culture and Language in Situations of Conflict \u00e2\u00a2 Degree in the Promotion of the Italian Language and Culture thought the World \u00e2\u00a2 Specialization Degree in Italian for Culture and Enterprise Intermediation \u00e2\u00a2 Degree in Advertising Techniques \u00e2\u00a2 Specialization Degree in Publicity Communication and Strategic Design \u00e2\u00a2 Degree in International Communication \u00e2\u00a2 Specialization Degree in Communication Systems and International Relations The University also offers one year Postgraduate courses which offer many variations. Supplementary Courses are offered on the basis of either monthly or two monthly intensive courses. They operate from level one to level five. The intensive supplementary courses generally provide for twenty one (2 1) hours a week. These lessons consist in the first stages of; I. Italian Language 2. Italian Language Drill Exercises 3. Phonetic Drill Exercises (classroom and language lab) 4. Conversation 483 At the end of the monthly or bi monthly session, students can receive a Certificate of Attendance and students sit an exam to determine at what level they have achieved and hence can progress to on another occasion. Many students from most nations of the world attend this university as the recognition of a study unit at the Universita per Stranieri is in general internationally accepted towards units of major degree courses at the universities of the student's origin. During my time and involvement in and around this unique university in Perugia, I found the whole experience highly educational, culturally rewarding and an addition to my knowledge of comparative educational institutions and opportunities. As I stated at the beginning of my report, the largest single group by ethnic origin in the electorate of Canning are of Italian heritage. This study and gathering of knowledge and hard data can only assist me in further representations and in particular the many potential students who would involve themselves in this exciting educational and cultural opportunity. CONCLUSION: My study journey has provided me with a better understanding of migration policies within other countries, highlighting the differences between our two own systems. I believe this understanding will prove invaluable to my position of Chairman of the Migration Committee. I understand that in accordance with Clause 9.5 of the Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 14 of 2003, this statement may be obtained from the Special Minister of State upon request by any member or senator. I also understand that this statement may be tabled in the Parliament at the discretion of the Special Minister of State.

Yours sincerely, Level 4, 4 Treasury Place Melbourne, Vie 3002 In July 2005, I visited the UK and Belgium for talks with policymakers, regulators and industry participants on developments in telecommunications and broadcasting regulation. I was accompanied on this trip by members of my staff who funded their own travel. Unfortunately, our trip coincided with the tragedy of the London bombings and as such some scheduled meetings had to be abandoned. However, despite this, the trip enabled us to meet with numerous representatives of government, regulators and industry to share their experiences on a wide range of issues in the rapidly changed fields of telecommunications and media. The following is an overview of the key issues raised in those discussions. Monday 4 July 2005 Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) Catherine Smadja, Director Digital Switchover Team, DCMS Jane Humphreys, Director Digital Switchover Team, Department of Trade and Industry John Mottram, Radio and Media Market Branch, DCMS Roger Sharp Special Adviser to the Secretary of State Tessa Jowell MP Discussions at the DCMS focused on the take up of digital television and digital radio. Digital Television The UK has the highest rate of penetration for digital television in the world with 62 per cent of households having the ability to receive digital broadcasts. The take-up of digital has accelerated markedly in the last year with over two million households purchasing the necessary equipment, an increase of 18 per cent. Broadcasts are received across three platforms: satellite, cable and terrestrial. The digital terrestrial system known as Freeview is received by 3.9 million homes. The satellite service, Sky, is received in 7.6 million households and cable companies supply digital TV to a further 2.5 million homes. Freeview has been a key driver of recent take up. Freeview set top boxes enable viewers to access that around 30 free digital TV channels, over 20 487 digital radio stations and a range of interactive services. Freeview is a joint venture between the BBC, Crown Castle International and Sky. DCMS officers stated that the additional programming content available on Freeview has been the major reason consumers have been persuaded to make the switch. The BBC has played a prominent role in providing this content. New digital channels launched by the BBC include: \u00e2\u00a2 BBC 3 featuring new comedy and drama \u00e2\u00a2 BBC 4 featuring culture, arts and science programming \u00e2\u00a2 Cbeebies for pre school children \u00e2\u00a2 CBBC for older children \u00e2\u00a2 BBC News 24, a 24 hour news channel and \u00e2\u00a2 BBC Parliament, a political news and current affairs channel. With take up progressing well, at the last election the Government made a manifesto commitment to complete the switchover to digital between 2008 and 2012 on a region by region basis. A digital switchover team has been created between DTI and DCMS to co-ordinate the process. Research shows the segment of the population that will be most reluctant to make the switch to digital are those aged over 75. DCMS officers advised that at this stage only 30 per of those over 75 have switched to digital. The concern of this age group seems to be primarily about the difficulties involved in installing and operating digital television rather than the cost of buying the set top box. To address, this issue the Government has been urging manufacturers to focus their attention on simplifying set top boxes and remote controls. The Government has indicated that it will develop a package of measures to assist disadvantaged groups to switch to digital. A communication program is underway on why the transition to digital is good for the UK and why it is necessary to switch off analogue broadcasts. Government research estimates that the switch off of 11 2 488 analogue will generate up to 2.2 billion pounds for the UK economy as spectrum is used more efficiently. The Government has asked broadcasters, transmission facility owners, manufacturers and retailers to work together on the transition. They have formed an organisation to co-ordinate the switchover called Digital TV UK. It has three major tasks: \u00e2\u00a2 to co-ordinate the technical roll out of digital terrestrial television across the UK, region by region, to a timetable agreed by Government. \u00e2\u00a2 to communicate with the public about digital switchover to ensure everyone knows what is happening \u00e2\u00a2 to liaise with TV equipment manufacturers, retailers, digital platform operators and consumer groups to ensure understanding of and support for the switchover programme. At present around 25 per cent of the UK population cannot currently receive Freeview broadcasts. The plan is to build the digital terrestrial network so that 98.5 per cent of population can receive digital signals. This the same proportion of the population that receives analogue broadcasts. The remainder of the population will be serviced by satellite. Debate is occurring about what use should be made of the additional spectrum freed up by the switch off of analogue broadcasting. Possible options include high definition television, mobile TV and 30 telephony, wireless broadband and more channels on Freeview. Digital Radio In the UK digital radio has been available for ten years. More than 1.3 million digital radios have already been sold and 25 per cent of UK adults listen to digital radio at least once a week. As with digital television, DCMS advised that new services have been the driver of take up. The BBC alone has established 5 new digital radio channels. Market research also indicates that the ability to pause and rewind 'live radio' is very popular with consumers. There are 100 million radios in the UK and consequently there is little real prospect of switching off analogue broadcasts. 3 489 DCMS advised that as the analogue radio spectrum was not worth as much as the television spectrum, there was little economic incentive to set a switch off date. At present there are no plans to migrate all stations across to digital broadcasting. Media Ownership Reform In 2003 the Blair Government passed a Communications Act which relaxed foreign ownership restrictions and allowed some common newspaper and television ownership. The legislation retained cross media restrictions for the most influential types of media. The market response to the changes has been limited to date. There has been some consolidation of ownership in the radio sector. Tuesday 5 July 2005 Department of Culture Media and Sport Andrew Ramsay, Director General, DCMS Discussions with Mr Ramsay focused on the Government's plan for a new BBC charter and its green paper \"A strong BBC, independent of Government which was released in March 2005. The UK Government has decided to renew the BBC's charter until 2016. The Green paper sets out new objectives for the BBC. These include sustaining citizenship, education and culture, serving different communities, playing a global role and building a digital Britain. The Government has decided to make significant changes to the BBC's governance arrangements to increase the scrutiny of the BBC's executive officers. It will replace the existing Board of Governors with a new BBC Trust. The Trust will be responsible for monitoring the executive board, setting strategic direction and representing the interests of licence fee payers. The Trust will appoint the Director-General and will be responsible for approving the other members of the executive board. The executive board will consist of 12 members including 4 will be non-executives who will be expected to perform the role of critical friend. 4 490 The Government has decided to retain the current arrangements where television license fees are used to fund the operations of the BBC. Mr Ramsay stated that there is awareness however that this method of funding the BBC may come under pressure with technological convergence raising questions about what devices should be defined as \"a television\". For example, should it include any computer with a tuner? The level of licence fee (currently 126 pounds for colour television) will be set during the next phase of the charter review. Television licence fee revenue is around 2.4 million pounds. The Government has said that after 2007 there will be a review of whether there is a case for looking at other methods of funding some of the BBC's operations such as subscription. The Government rejected suggestions by commercial broadcasters that they should share in licence fee revenue because they also perform public service broadcasting. Mr Ramsay noted that there has been some criticism that too much BBC programming simply copies formats that are successful on commercial television. The Green paper states that the BBC should avoid this copy cat programming in the chase for ratings This is a difficult balancing exercise for the BBC. If people are not watching its programs it will be hard for the organisation to justify the massive amount of revenue that it receives through the licence fee. Consultations on the Green Paper had just finished at the time of our visit The Government will be releasing a white paper in November. There are a number of outstanding issues remaining to be resolved. One important issue relates to the BBC's use of independent production firms. This is an issue that has also been raised in the past in relation to the ABC and will no doubt be considered as part of the forthcoming efficiency review. At present 25 per cent of BBC television productions have to be commissioned from the independent sector. BBC radio has adopted a voluntary 10 per cent quota. The Government has also said that it would like to see more programming commissioned outside London. 5 491 The Government is currently examining whether these quotas should be increased. Wednesday 6 July SKY Richard Freudenstein, Chief Operating Officer Ray Gallagher, Director of Public Affairs The Sky satellite subscription television service presently has 7.8 million subscribers who are accessing up to 400 channels. Sky has been the leader in digital television in the UK. It launched its digital service in 1998. The Company borrowed heavily to get the service established. Digital set top boxes were given away to customers during this phase to build the subscriber base. Since the launch of digital, the number of Sky subscribers has increased by 4.1 million. SKY is focused on enhancing the quality of its digital services. Recently it launched a new product called Sky+. This is a hard disk recorder with links to Sky's program guide. It allows customers to pause and rewind live TV. It also has two digital tuners allowing viewers to watch and record at the same time. Mr Freudenstein reported that 770,000 units have been sold to date. This figure represents 10 per cent of subscribers. It is essentially the same product as the FOXTEL IQ which was launched in Australia earlier this year. Mr Freudenstein said that next year Sky plans to launch a high definition digital service. Sky is an open platform; companies can to provide content for the platform based on access prices set by the regulator OFCOM. Sky is one of the shareholders in the Freeview digital terrestrial platform. It does not regard the success of Freeview as a threat to Sky's business. Sky takes the view that once people experience digital broadcasting they will be attracted to the superior content and technology that is available on the Sky platform. Mr Gallagher commented that Freeview is a 'stepping stone' to Sky. Sky has acknowledged that there is a part of the market that would like the choice provided by extra channels but is reluctant to pay a monthly fee. In a bid to cater for this type of customer, Sky has launched a free to 6 492 air satellite service. Viewers can access 200 channels for a one off fee of 150 pounds to purchase the receiving equipment. Over the long term Sky believes that will be able to achieve 80 per cent market penetration for their pay TV service. It is clear that Sky's ability to secure the rights for major sports such as the Premier League football have been crucial to their success. This in turn reflects the fact that the UK equivalent of the anti-siphoning list contains a much narrower range of events compared to the Australian list. Sky claimed that their track record of providing comprehensive and innovative coverage of events had lessened public concern about the migration of sports to pay TV. In relation to analogue switch off, Sky acknowledged that there would be difficulties in persuading some groups to make the transition. Sky said that the Government should not favour one particular platform in seeking to address this problem. Sky argued that the Government should allocate vouchers to assist low income consumers to make the switch rather than give away Freeview set top boxes. We concluded the meeting with a discussion of moves by cable operators to offer a triple play of TV, telephony and internet services and the effect of these initiatives on the marketplace. BBC Nicholas Kroll, Director of Governance, BBC Nicholas Kroll is the BBC's first Director of Governance. This position was established to address perceptions in some quarters that the Governors of the BBC were not providing adequate scrutiny to BBC management. Mr Kroll heads the Governance unit, a new department operating exclusively in support of the Board. It is designed ensure that the Governors receive the advice to make informed and independent judgements and to scrutinise proposals coming from management. The Board of Governors' of the BBC has broad range of responsibilities including: 7 493 \u00e2\u00a2 regulating the BBC on content issues, in particular impartiality and accuracy. \u00e2\u00a2 ensuring the BBC meets its fair trading obligations and \u00e2\u00a2 ensuring that complaints are properly handled by the BBC (including taking appeals on editorial complaints handled by the Editorial Complaints Unit and Divisional Directors). Under the Government's plans for a new BBC charter these responsibilities will be taken up by the BBC trust. Mr Kroll spent some time explaining how the trust would operate. He said that the BBC Trust is to be an outward facing body representing licence payers. The Executive Board led by the Director-General should be a delivery arm operating within guidelines set by the Trust. All members of the Trust will hold office on a part time basis. The Governance unit will continue under the new regime with a staff of around 30 or 40 people. He emphasised that he does not see the governance unit as in an adversarial relationship with BBC management. The Governance unit is currently considering is how to ensure that the Trust properly represents the views of licence fee payers. Mr Kroll expressed support for public meetings around the UK to give the public the opportunity to directly put their views to trustees. Complaints handling Mr Kroll outlined the new system for dealing with editorial complaints that the BBC introduced in February 2005. Complaints concerning the BBC's partiality and accuracy are dealt with internally. The industry regulator OFCOM does have jurisdiction to hear complaints in relation taste and decency issues arising from BBC programs. Under the new code of conduct, the BBC should respond to all complaints within ten working days of their receipt. LN Where an issue causes a large number of complaints, the BBC's response is published on their website. If the complaint is not satisfied with the initial response they can ask the independent Editorial Complaints Unit (ECU) to investigate. 8 494 The final avenue of appeal is to the Governors' Programme Complaints Committee. World Service The final topic for our discussion with Mr Kroll concerned the BBC World Service. The BBC World Service is funded by the Treasury and has the mission of projecting British values to the world. Mr Kroll described the service as a 'national interest endeavour'. This was an interesting discussion in the context of the Government's recent decision to put the Asia Pacific television service currently provided by the ABC out to tender. It raised questions about whether commercial operators would be capable of achieving the national interest objectives of these international broadcasting services. Digital One Quentin Howard Jeff Astle Digital One is the sole national commercial digital radio multiplex operator. It broadcasts eight national commercial radio stations covering a variety of genres. It is responsible for transmitting the stations, but not for producing the programme content. The take up of digital radio in the UK is very strong with digital radios selling at the rate of 100,000 per month. Units can now be purchased for as low as 39 pounds. More than 85 percent of the UK population live in areas that can receive digital terrestrial broadcasts. Mr Howard argued that the Government should set a switch off date for analogue radio broadcasts, albeit in up to twenty years time, to encourage manufacturers to invest in digital products. Mr Howard said that the digital was changing the way consumer use the radio but advertisers have not yet realised the potential of the technology. Digital radio can provide graphics, moving pictures and additional information on advertised products. The UK experience is that the total number of hours people spend listening to the radio has increased since the multitude of new channels was introduced. 9 495 Mr Howard commented that obtaining spectrum for digital radio was a big issue. He noted that telecommunications companies were very hungry for any additional spectrum that became available. He said that he was lobbying strongly for the international acceptance of new compression standards such as AAC plus that make more efficient use of available spectrum. Digital One's position as the sole national commercial multiplex owner gives it substantial market power. Under the business plan that it pursues Digital One seeks to ensure that the services it transmits are in different genres. Its capacity to determine the mix of content would seem to raise competition concerns. Mr Howard argued that the competition concerns should be balanced against the fact that there are 40 regional multiplexes and that digital radio is available on other platforms such as digital television (Freeview and Sky) and the Internet. Thursday 71b July BBC- Bush House Mike Cronk, Controller, Distribution and Technology Jonathan Stott, Principal R&D Engineer These discussions were intended to focus on the technical aspects of the BBC's work on digital radio and digital television. Following the tube and bus bombings earlier in the morning, the meeting was terminated after a short time to allow Mr Cronk and Mr Stott to perform other required duties. Digital radio Mr Stott pointed out that DAB digital radio broadcasting technology has been around for many years. He said that manufacturers refused to produce receivers until there was a sizeable market for the product. This had been created in the UK by the additional content provided by the BBC and commercial broadcasters. The BBC has launched 5 channels since 2002. Mr Stott said that the key to further enhancing take up was to encourage car manufacturers to include digital receivers. 10 496 The discussion then turned to the BBC 's work on DRM -Digital Radio Mondiale. This is a digital radio broadcasting system that is being developed by the BBC as part of an international consortium. DRM broadcasts have the advantage of travelling a long way giving extended coverage from a single transmitter. Mr Stott suggested that the DRM should be considered in Australia as part of plans to introduce digital radio as it provides an effective means of servicing large land areas. The BBC plans to use DRM to transmit its World Service. The DRM broadcasts are more robust than the AM service currently received. AM broadcasts are often of low quality because of interference. Towards the end of this year the BBC will begin servicing Europe with these broadcasts. Mr Stott stressed that the two types of digital radio broadcasting - DAB (currently used in the UK) and DRM are complementary. A single digital radio can support both technologies just as analogue radio supports AM and FM. Mr Stott said that these new radios which can receive digital and analogue broadcasts will be available by Christmas in the UK. The London bombings brought the city to a standstill. The underground was closed. All buses into the centre of London were cancelled. Many taxis avoided the city. The police requested that all persons in the city remain inside the building they were in. Mobile phones overloaded and it took 12 hours before my phone worked. I Commercial Radio Companies Association (CRCA) Paul Brown, CEO This meeting was cancelled following the London terrorist attack. Friday gth July British Telecom Clive Ansell, Group Strategy Director. This meeting was cancelled following the London terrorist attack ii 497 OFCOM Richard Hooper, Deputy Chairman Michael Johnson, Senior Policy Executive Martin Booth (Programme Executive, Content and Standards) Despite the bombing of the London Underground on the day before this meeting, representatives of Ofcom were accommodating enough to honour our scheduled meeting at Ofcom's new London headquarters. The fact that these Ofcom representatives were prepared to go ahead with our meeting despite most of the city remaining closed down at this time was a very impressive demonstration of the level of their commitment. Ofcom's hospitality in difficult circumstances was much appreciated. We had also been scheduled to meet with Sean Williams (Partner, Competition and Investigations), however due to transport problems resulting from the bombing, Mr Williams was unable to attend the meeting. Our discussions with Ofcom broadly fell into two areas: telecommunications regulation and media regulation. Telecommunications Regulation The majority of our discussion with Ofcom regarding telecommunications focused on the terms of the recently announced telecommunications settlement between Ofcom and BT. Ofcom provided us with a number of valuable background documents on the terms of the settlement and was able to walk us through the terms of the settlement. Ofcom indicated to us that negotiations with BT over the terms of the settlement had been very tough and that the process proved more difficult than many people had anticipated. However as a result of Ofcom's efforts, a settlement was reached with BT that created an approach to telecommunications regulation that is unique in the world. Under Ofcom's settlement, BT has accepted legally binding undertakings that are enforceable by Ofcom and third parties. The broad elements of BT's undertakings are: 2 498 The creation of a new and operationally separate business unit (Access Services Division) which would provide regulated services to access seekers. ASD would have a separate and distinct brand, physical location, staff, staff bonus scheme and operating and trading systems. ASD would also be required to offer \"Equivalence of Input\", that is both access seekers and BT will be able to access the same products from ASD at the same prices, through the same processes. ASD would also involve access seekers in the product development process for future services. Regulated products that would be delivered by ASD include Unbundled Local Loop, all forms of Wholesale Line Rental and Backhaul products. The creation of a new \"Equality of Access Board\" to oversee the operations of ASD and ensure the delivery of Equivalence of Input. The Equality of Access Board would not be an operating management board, but would instead be a compliance board without formal powers. The board would be chaired by a non-executive director of BT and would also include four other members, three of whom would be independent of BT and appointed in consultation with Ofcom. Commitments from BT with respect to the roll out of Next Generation Networks to ensure that this roll out occurs in a way that does not inhibit third party access. In addition to the recently concluded settlement, we were also able to briefly discuss a number of other emerging telecommunications regulatory issues with Ofcom. In the area of mobile telephony, Ofcom was keen to discuss with us the progress that the ACCC had recently made in the area of Mobile Terminating Access Service Declaration. Ofcom was facing many similar issues in the UK, especially in the area of fixed to mobile termination and those present were interested to learn from any Australian experiences in this regard. Also on the topic of mobile telephony regulation, Ofcom discussed with us a number emerging issues that it planned to address in the near future relating to the regulation of international roaming charges and mobile content. Spectrum Management One of OFCOM's key responsibilities is to ensure the optimal use of radiocommunications spectrum. In June 2005 OFCOM published its spectrum framework review statement which set out how it was going to manage the spectrum that is under its control. 13 499 OFCOM has signalled a move a way from the \"command and control\" model where government decided what use a particular band should be put to and who should be allowed to transmit in the band. In OFCOM's view this approach has become problematic as demand for spectrum has begun to exceed supply. Government is sometimes left in the position of having to arbitrate between different uses. OFCOM believes that \u00e2\u00a2 spectrum should be free of usage constraints \u00e2\u00a2 licence holders should be able to simply change ownership and usage of spectrum. In general terms spectrum should be allocated to the highest bidder with the purchaser free to change the use to which to spectrum is put to. OFCOM favours moving towards the Australian model of spectrum management and allow licensees more freedom with respect to the uses that they make of spectrum rights. The issue of managing spectrum is going to be of special importance in the next few years as the UK moves to switch off analogue television which will free up a large amount of extra spectrum. OFCOM's approach has drawn criticism from companies that have paid very high prices for spectrum to be used to provide 3G mobile telephony services. IPTV Mr Hooper expressed doubts about the speed at which Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) will revolutionise broadcasting. He stated that at present the economics of IPTV are very problematic. Mr Hooper explained that the marginal cost of adding additional viewers for terrestrial broadcasting was zero. In contrast as the number of users of an IPTV service increases server and bandwidth requirements represent significant constraints on IPTV. Broadcasting Code OFCOM is required to draw up a code for television and radio covering standards in programmes, sponsorship, fairness and privacy. A new code which replaces 6 previous codes that OFCOM inherited came into effect in July and Mr Hooper provided an overview of its features. 14 500 There are a number of significant differences between the approach in the UK and comparable Australian regulation like the commercial television industry code of practice. Unlike the situation in Australia, where people are directed to complain first to a broadcaster before approaching the regulator, in the UK complaints may go straight to OFCOM. OFCOM strives for a quick response to complaints. The complaints unit aims to respond to 80 per cent of complaints in 10 working days and all complaints within 15 working days. Compared to ACMA, OFCOM is given a much wider range of sanctions that it can apply if it finds that a broadcaster has deliberately, seriously or repeatedly breached the code. The available sanctions include: \u00e2\u00a2 issuing a direction not to repeat a programme; \u00e2\u00a2 issuing a direction to broadcast a correction or a statement of OFCOM's finding; \u00e2\u00a2 imposing a financial penalty of up to \u00a3250,000 \u00e2\u00a2 shortening the period of a licence or \u00e2\u00a2 revoke a licence. The capacity of the regulator to impose a financial penalty seems to be a useful to addition to the regulator's arsenal providing a step between giving broadcasters a slap on the wrist and the extreme option of revoking a licence. The other notable feature about the broadcasting code is the flexibility with which it is applied. In assessing whether programming is appropriate, OFCOM can take into account matters such as the channel on which the material was shown. Essentially OFCOM subjects BBC 1, the flagship national broadcaster, to higher standards than commercial operators such as ITV or channel 4. Sports List Discussions also focused on the operation of the UK 'sports list' - the equivalent to the Australia's anti-siphoning regime. As is widely known, the UK sports list is much narrower in scope than its Australian counterpart. There are only 10 events where free to air broadcasters must be offered live broadcasting rights. These include: \u00e2\u00a2 The Olympic Games 15 501 \u00e2\u00a2 The FIFA World Cup Finals Tournament \u00e2\u00a2 The European Football Championship Finals Tournament \u00e2\u00a2 The FA Cup Final \u00e2\u00a2 The Scottish FA Cup Final (in Scotland) \u00e2\u00a2 The Grand National \u00e2\u00a2 The Derby \u00e2\u00a2 The Wimbledon Tennis Finals \u00e2\u00a2 The Rugby League Challenge Cup Final \u00e2\u00a2 The Rugby World Cup Final These fixtures are described as 'Group A' events. As is the case in Australia, the listing of an event does not guarantee that it will be shown on free to air television. It does however maximise the chance of the event being shown because it ensures that rights are offered to free to broadcasters on fair and reasonable terms. The UK regime also gives free to air broadcasters more limited access to a further range of fixtures known as group B events. In relation events such as \u00e2\u00a2 Cricket Test Matches played in England \u00e2\u00a2 Non-Finals play in the Wimbledon Tournament \u00e2\u00a2 Six Nations Rugby Tournament Matches Involving Home Countries \u00e2\u00a2 The Commonwealth Games \u00e2\u00a2 The Cricket World Cup and \u00e2\u00a2 The Open Golf Championship free to air broadcasters must be offered delayed coverage or a highlights package. This issue of the sports list was causing some debate during our time in the UK. There was considerable disquiet about the fact that from 2006 cricket test played in UK will only be seen live on Sky. Free to air viewers will only have access to a highlights package. The ECB and the Government have attracted strong criticism for failing to prevent the loss of live cricket from free to air television. This situation arose because after the last review of the list in 1998, test cricket was moved from the group A list to group B list. It V 16 502 Following our visit, there have been reports that the government is considering restoring cricket to the group A list at the expiry of Sky's current contract. The key criterion for including an event on the sports list is that the event must have 'national resonance'. It must have elements that serve to unite the nation and not just be of interest to devotees of a particular sport. In Australia, events must be of national significance in order to be listed. While this appears similar to the national resonance test in the UK, Australian Government's have traditionally taken a much broader view of the range of sports fitting this description than the UK government. From an Australian point of view, the omission of the Premier League football from both the A and B list seems extraordinary. It is difficult to imagine that AFL or NRL matches would be ever completely excluded from the anti-siphoning list OFCOM officials stated that the exclusion of Premier League matches is based on the premise that although the Premier league is of great interest to football fans it does not resonate with the nation in the same way as the FIFA World Cup or the European Championships. 17 303 Monday 11 July European Commission, information Society Directorate Peter Rodford Stephen Bamable Peter Scott Alex Willen Those present at this meeting were representatives of the European Commission charged with monitoring and facilitating the implementation of the EC's communications directives. The EC issued a new directive on E-coms regulation in 2002 and member states have been in the process of implementing the directive since that time. As is the case in Australia the EC has split responsibility for content regulation from infrastructure regulation. The EC's regulatory model is market based in that each country is required to investigate the level of competition in specific markets within their jurisdiction before taking regulatory decisions. In the area of Unbundled Local Loop, the EC issued a directive on the issue in 2000. Those present expressed a reasonable amount of satisfaction with how take up of ULL had progressed throughout Europe since this time. Despite initial problems over issues like rights of way, the EC believed that there was an increasing acceptance of graduated access to monopoly infrastructure on the part of incumbent telecommunications operators and that market shares for new entrants were increasing. However, those present did recognise that the success of ULL would rely on continuing the heavily interventionist approach to ULL that had been taken in Europe the past. Those present commented that those jurisdictions which had enjoyed the greatest success in ULL take up had been those jurisdictions in which the national regulator had 'rolled up its sleeves' and become heavily involved in the process. The most striking aspect of our discussion on ULL take up was the extent to which the problems faced by European regulators in facilitating access to monopoly infrastructure controlled by incumbent operators mirrored those problems faced in Australia. After discussing ULL take up, the conversation then turned to Ofcom's recently concluded telecommunications settlement with BT. Those present were generally complimentary of the settlement and Ofcom's approach to operational separation. Those present noted that Ofcom's approach to 'equivalence' sat comfortably within the EC Directive's requirement for 'non-discrimination' and as such was broadly consistent 18 504 with the EC framework. Those present were interested to see how Ofcom went about implementing the settlement in practice and the outcomes that it would be able to achieve in the short term. Those present also noted the fact that in Europe competition between telecommunications companies and cable television operators was a useful spur to the take up of broadband. They noted that in those countries in which there was an independent cable operator competing with telecommunications companies, broadband take up was much higher. Those present did however concede that the extent of cable roll out in a particular country affected how significant the impact of the presence of competing cable operators was on broadband take up. Those present expressed surprise at the Australian situation in which the incumbent telecommunications operator (Telstra) also held a controlling stake in the only cable television operator (Foxtel). They speculated that this situation may be a contributing factor to the poor take up of broadband in Australia. Another interesting aspect of our discussion was that those present also noted the slow emergence of international Europe-wide markets in the EC for some services. This process was being driven by international companies like Vodafone offering flat fee international roaming products. Those present anticipated that this trend would have significant implications for European telecommunications regulation in the future. Those present also noted regulatory steps were already in the works to address these issues with tentative steps being taken towards a European wide numbering policy. However those present recognised the resistance that this was being met with by incumbent telecommunications operators and noted that the results of this process were far from certain. In the area of spectrum management, the EC currently allocates spectrum to licensees for specific uses. However those present noted that there was an emerging debate in the EC about the merits of moving away from this system and towards the Australian approach in which generally users were free to use their spectrum for any use. However, those present noted that there were substantial road blocks to the adoption of such and approach in the EC and that any such move would be met with resistance by some member states on the grounds of violation of national sovereignty. An interesting set of issues being deal with by the EC in this regard were the spectrum management problems being posed by the emergence of Broadband over Power Lines. Those present believed that the issues 19 505 'V relating to claimed interference of BPL with radio operators could be adequately addressed without banning BPL. They believed that the 'no interference' approach to spectrum management should continue to be phased out and a new approach in which any interference that is caused is managed after the fact should be established. Those present noted that Spain and France were currently engaging in BPL trials to attempt to resolve these issues. Another area of discussion in this meeting was on the future of European equivalents of the Australian Universal Service Obligation. On this topic those present noted that the relevant governing EC directive allows each member state to determine their own funding mechanisms for their USOs. In practice this has meant that the funding models applied by member states for USOs have varied significantly, with some countries like the UK even legislating so that the company responsible for providing the USO would not receive any financial compensation at all. Those present were suspicious of moves to include broadband at reasonable prices in the USO. The general view was that if such an approach was adopted in a country that employed an industry levy approach to funding the USO, the effect of including broadband in the USO would be a wealth transfer from the poor to the rich. Those present formed this conclusion on the basis that funding obtained through a USO industry level would come predominantly from PSTN revenues, which are paid predominantly by residential customers. If this money were then to be applied to providing broadband through the USO, this would have the effect of distributing a tax on the generally less wealthy PSTN users to the generally more wealthy users of broadband. Those present also noted that while the EC regulatory regime prohibited the provision of financial assistance for telecommunications services (excluding funding provided through USO programs), the EU investment bank was currently providing loans on favourable terms for telecommunications infrastructure roll outs throughout the EC. However, those present were concerned that to date, incumbent telecommunications companies were obtaining a large proportion of this funding. European Community, European Regulators Group Davide Gallino (Deputy Secretary) The European Regulators Group acts as a liaison group between national European regulatory authorities in European Community member states and the European Commission. Its role is to facilitate information 20 506 exchange and to act as an expert advisory group to foster the harmonisation of telecommunications regulation in the European Community. We had a very useful discussion with Mr Gallino about European regulators' experiences in imposing transparency measures on incumbent telecommunications operators. Mr Gallino informed us that European regulators had learnt a number of lessons in this regard including: The importance of the mandating and enforcing technical and service equivalence as well as pricing equivalence for access seekers; The need for separation regimes to be accompanied by rigorous and continuing regulatory intervention. Mr Gallino made the point that some European jurisdictions had developed extremely impressive separation regimes on paper, however achieved very little as national regulators as these jurisdictions had failed to actively police these regimes; The importance of granting access seekers access to the same IT provisioning systems as incumbent operator's retail arms; The need to publish costs data so that third parties are able to analyse them and make an assessment as to whether they are realistic. Mr Gallino also provided us with a detailed outline of the operation of the Italian telecommunications regulatory regime and its unique accounting separation regime. Mr Gallino also strongly made the point that the presence of independent competitive cable television operators in a member state acted as a significant spur to broadband take-up in that country. Mr Gallino emphasised that the broadband take up rates of EC member states where there either was not a competitive cable television operator or where the cable television operator was controlled by the incumbent telecommunications player were vastly lower than the states in which cable operators were able to provide infrastructure competition for the provision of broadband. Again Mr Gallino expressed surprise at the Australian situation in this regard. Tuesday 12 July European Competitive Telecommunications Association Sandro Bazzanella (Director, European Affairs) Caroline De Cook (Chair, Public Policy Working Group) Mario Filiponi (Chair, Mobile Working Group) 21 507 ECTA is a trade association of new entrants in European telecommunications markets. Its objectives are the competitive liberalisation of telecommunications markets within the EC. Its membership comprises a large number of European telecommunications companies (as many companies which are the incumbent in their home country are often a new entrant in other jurisdictions and are therefore supportive of ECTA 's goals). Our discussion with ECTA covered a number of emerging telecommunications policy areas. With respect to the 2002 EC Directive on telecommunications ECTA noted that on paper the regulatory framework was very good, taking an economically responsible approach and allowing member states flexibility as to how best to implement the regime. However, those present were frustrated that the realised benefits of the directive were uneven across member states because the terms of the directive had been implemented to varying degrees by the national governments of member states. ECTA was far less optimistic about the level of take up of ULL products in the EC than the representatives of the EC with whom we met. ECTA noted that the recently concluded Ofcom Telecommunications Settlement was the most advanced regulatory regime in Europe. ECTA were of the view that the Ofcom settlement would probably provide useful transparency of costs for regulators and third parties, however cautioned that they were keen to see how the regime would actually operate in practice. ECTA commented that there were a number of areas of the Telecommunications Settlement in which it was still trying to negotiate side letters with Ofcom on a number of issues (eg whether Ofcom would be required to develop genuine internal contracts). While ECTA was generally positive about developments in the UK, it did note that it was pessimistic about the prospects for the UK's example to be followed by other member states. Those present commented that the UK model was the result of a 'conjunction of phenomenon' in that the incumbent operator was willing to negotiate at the same time as the regulator was undertaking a wholesale review of the regulatory regime. They believed that these circumstances were unlikely to eventuate in other member states. ECTA also made a number of comments on the performance of other member states' regulatory regimes. ECTA noted that the German market remained very closed and was being frustrated by the German regulator treating the incumbent's cost accounting as commercial in confidence. 22 508 ECTA also noted that while Italy's regulatory regime was extremely impressive on paper, it had failed to produce practical outcomes due to a lack of enforcement of the regime. ECTA also provided us with impressive economic research undertaken by the organisation on telecommunications investment levels. This research developed a regulatory scorecard to assess the openness of each EC member state's telecommunications regime and then modelled each country's score against OECD figures on the level of telecommunications investment in each country. This research showed a strong correlation between the openness of a country's telecommunications regulatory regime and the overall level of investment in this sector. This research seemed to rebut the argument that is sometimes made that investment in a country's telecommunications sector can be promoted by giving incumbent telecommunications operators a holiday from competition regulation. A further issue that we were able to discuss with ECTA at some length was the emergence of Next Generation Networks and the impact that this would have on the competitive environment. ECTA was of the view that the emergence of NGNs presented a real opportunity to increase technical opportunities for access to incumbents networks (eg by allowing access seekers to select points of interconnection). However, ECTA believed that it was important for regulators to develop appropriate rules to ensure that incumbent operators did not develop their networks in such a way as to preclude competitive access. In this respect ECTA favoured the development of consultation mechanisms between incumbents, access seekers and regulators concerning the technical design of NGNs. ECTA was engaged in the development of a white paper on this issue at the time that we met with them. EC - Information Society and Media Directorate-General Bernd Langeheine (Director B, Coms Services, Policy and regulatory I framework, EC) Mr Langeheine made a number of points regarding the success of member states' regulatory regimes. Mr Langeheine noted that while progress had been made harmonising the regulatory frameworks within member states a significant variance in the strength of regulators across member states was still in existence. We were able to discuss the upcoming privatisation of Telstra with Mr Langeheine. On privatisation Mr Langeheine noted that many EU 23 509 governments retained significant government holdings of their incumbent telecommunications companies. Many countries retained an interest of over 35% giving them effective control over the companies. Mr Langeheine again emphasised the importance of the presence of independent cable television operators for driving the take up of broadband in a country. Mr Langeheine noted that the lack of cable competition in the provision of broadband in Germany was an important contributor to Germany's lack of success in this regard. Similarly, the lack of competing cable in France has meant that the French regulator has been forced to take drastic action with respect to ULL pricing in order to drive broadband take up. Mr Langeheine noted that the EC was undertaking a review of the impacts of convergence and next generation networks on the existing regulatory framework. p 24 510 MR JOEL FITZGIBBON MP 511 Joel Fitzgibbon M.P.
