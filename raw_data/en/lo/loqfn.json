The New York Center for Integrative Health embodies this definition and lives up to its name. There is power in combining the modern and the traditional. The team at NYCIH has extensive experience in supporting the health and well-being of individuals in and near White Plains, greater Westchester County, and metro New York City. Integrative medicine goes beyond a blend of traditional practices, like acupuncture, with modern medical treatments, technologies, and products. We strive to get ahead and stay ahead of chronic health challenges. Through this approach, we can successfully intervene with a wide range of mental, emotional, and physical conditions early into the disease process. We appreciate that true health transcends the physical. It accounts for all the factors that make up your unique \"self\" and contribute to the \"whole.\" Another way of looking at these separate yet interconnected circles of your life is to consider the following: In addition to acupuncture, we encourage sustained healing with functional, mind-body, and naturopathic medicine. These therapies include nutraceuticals, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, and botanicals. Diagnostics such as microbiome and DNA analysis further help us understand the unique shortfalls and gaps in your health and your individual needs.
