The beauty of these practices is that you can use them anytime, in sickness or in health (preventative care). Support Your Gut Health Did you know your immunity begins in your gut? Yep, over 70% of your immune response originates in your gut, so nourishing your body with nutritious foods that support your gut health should be a high priority. Here are some great immune-boosting foods: - Garlic - Lemons - Cayenne - Apple cider vinegar - Vegetables - Sprouted foods - Organic green juices - Fresh herbs including rosemary, thyme, cilantro and oregano Get Quality Probiotics Probiotics help your immune system fight, beginning in your gut. High quality probiotic foods or supplements are an important way to support your microbiome so your body can defend itself. [doTERRA PB Assist+](https://shop.home-essential-oils.com/products/doterra-pb-assist-probiotic-defense-formula) is a proprietary formula of pre-biotic fiber and six strains of probiotic microorganisms in a unique doublelayer vegetable capsule. It delivers 6 billion CFUs of active probiotic cultures and soluble pre-biotic FOS (fructooligosaccharides) that encourage friendly bacterial growth. PB Assist+ offers a unique, safe, and effective way to deliver the well-recognized digestive and immune system support benefits of probiotics. Some quality food sources are fermented vegetables (like sauerkraut, kimchi, and fermented pickles), coconut kefir, kombucha, and miso. Say NO to Sugar If there's one nutrition tip I can recommend for you during this time, it's this: SAY NO TO SUGAR. Sugar literally slows down your immune response and gives invaders the chance to get a hold in your body. Stay Hydrated and Get Powerful Antioxidants Antioxidants are vital for your cells' health and to give your immune system the support it needs. They also give your liver a boost to help it detox your cells efficiently. One of my favorite antioxidant sources is [Lemon essential oil](https://shop.home-essential-oils.com/products/doterra-lemon-essential-oil). Add one drop to your water. Delicious! Also try: [Grapefruit](https://shop.home-essential-oils.com/products/doterra-grapefruit-essential-oil) and [Tangerine](https://shop.home-essential-oils.com/products/doterra-tangerine-essential-oil) to give your body and immune system the co- factors it needs. Get Enough Sleep and Cut Your Stress Lack of sleep and staying stressed out puts more work on your body and can slow down your immune system. Here are some fantastic ways to support rest and calm in your body: - Stick to your rituals (or make new ones). Get your favorite calming essential oils like Serenity and breathe in the aromatherapy. Try doTERRA [Serenity Essential Oil](https://shop.home-essential-oils.com/products/doterra-serenity-restful-blend)and [Serenity Restful Complex Softgels](https://shop.home-essential-oils.com/products/doterra-serenity-restful-complex-softgels)for a powerful relaxing combo. - Set boundaries. Protecting your energy should be your #1 priority! - Set yourself up for sleep success. Dim your lights, turn off your phone, and diffuse calming oils like Lavender or Roman Chamomile to get yourself ready to sleep well. Move Your Body Moving your body allows your lymphatic system and blood vessels to circulate appropriately, getting your cells the nutrients and oxygen they need while draining and clearing out the junk that drags you down. This doesn't have to be anything big: a couple 4-minute Tabata sequences, a walk around the block, an at-home yoga flow, or a hike in fresh air will do! Support Your Body with Supplements Supplements are a crucial way you can support your body's overall health at this, and any, time of the year. Your immune system interacts with every other system in your body, so you will want to be doing everything you can to give your body what it needs. In particular: - Selenium - Magnesium - Iron - B vitamins - Vitamins C and D - Vitamin E All these vitamins and minerals play an important part in keeping your body and immune system thriving. All of these can be found in [doTERRA's Lifelong Vitality Pack](https://shop.home-essential-oils.com/products/doterra-lifelong-vitality-pack). Take the Power Back into Your Hands While we can't guarantee what tomorrow holds, we can take steps to defend ourselves and our families through these methods. Your immune system is designed to ward off invaders and recover. All the power to protect yourself and heal lies within you! These tools are one of the best ways to naturally support taking control of your health back into the power of your own hands.
