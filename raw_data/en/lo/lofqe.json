It is so rewarding to help children and their families through their illnesses, no matter how minor or severe, so that they can have the best quality of life and the most normal childhood possible.\" - Joseph Flynn, MD, MS, is a Professor of Pediatrics in the University of Washington School of Medicine and Chief of the Division of Nephrology at Seattle Children's. He also holds the Dr. Robert O. Hickman Endowed Chair in Pediatric Nephrology. Dr. Flynn completed his pediatric nephrology training at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in Philadelphia, PA, and later received an MS in Clinical Research from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. During his fellowship training, Dr. Flynn obtained experience in clinical research under the guidance of Bruce Kaiser, MD, and also worked in the laboratory of Dr. Bonita Falkner at the Medical College of Pennsylvania. He has developed specialized expertise in the treatment of childhood hypertension and has published extensively in this area, including several publications as the lead investigator of industry-sponsored clinical trials. More recently, he has established an interest in cardiovascular complications of chronic kidney disease in children and is a lead investigator in the NIH-sponsored CKiD cohort study, which focuses on cardiovascular disease in this population. Dr. Flynn has served as a research mentor to numerous pediatric nephrology trainees who now hold faculty positions at other academic institutions. Additionally, he has served on the Working Group of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program, is a past-president of the American Society of Pediatric Nephrology, and is the co-chair of an American Academy of Pediatrics committee charged with developing new guidelines for childhood hypertension. In addition to seeing patients at the Seattle Children's hospital campus, Dr. Flynn also travels to Montana to provide outreach services. - - I believe he is a very good doctor for kidneys - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2022 Seattle Magazine 2022 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2018 Seattle Magazine 2018 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2017 Seattle Magazine 2017 Seattles Top Doctor 2016 Seattle Met Magazine 2016 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2016 Seattle Magazine 2016 Jose Strauss Visiting Professor Award The Jose Strauss Visiting Professor Award is given in recognition of \"His academic achievements and commitment to excellence,\" and for his support of the Miami Pediatric Nephrology Seminar.
