Aromatherapy/Essential Oils/Sacred Sage Blessing Mist: Aromatherapy Aromatherapy is the practice of using distilled volatile plant oils - including essential oils - for psychological and physical well-being. The science of aromatherapy and essential oils is as old as the beginning of time, although it was lost through the ages and has only begun to make its reentry into the modern world during the last 50 years. The essential oils used in aromatherapy have a different composition compared to other herbal products because the distillation used in aromatherapy recovers the lighter phytomolecules. From Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatherapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatherapy) \"A Brief History Of Aromatherapy/Essential Oils: In 1937, the word first appeared in print in a French book on the subject: Aromath\u00e9rapie: Les Huiles Essentielles, Hormones V\u00e9g\u00e9tales by [Ren\u00e9-Maurice Gattefoss\u00e9](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9-Maurice_Gattefoss%C3%A9), a chemist. An English version was published in 1993. In 1910, Gattefoss\u00e9 burned a hand very badly which he claimed to have treated with lavendar oils. A French surgeon, [Jean Valnet](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Valnet), pioneered the medicinal uses of essential oils, which he used as antiseptics in the treatment of wounded soldiers during [World War II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II).\" Aromatherapy: Aromatherapy is a widely used term for a range of traditional therapies in which pure essential oils are either absorbed through the skin or inhaled. These therapies may include: - Topical applications: general massage, baths, compresses, and theraputic skin care; and - Aerial diffusion for environmental fragrancing or aerial disinfection, and - Direct inhalation: for respiratory disinfection, decongestion, expectoration as well as psychological effects. Essential Oil Products and Consultations: Essential Oils: An essential oil is a concentrated [hydrophobic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic) liquid containing volatile [aroma compounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroma_compound) from plants. Essential oils are also known as volatile oils, ethereal oils or aetherolea, or simply as the \"oil of\" the plant from which they were extracted, such as oil of clove. An [oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil) is \"essential\" in the sense that it carries a distinctive scent, or essence, of the plant. Essential oils do not form a distinctive category for any medical, pharmacological, or culinary purpose.\" Individual consultations may be arranged through Coyote Moon Healing Center to discuss essential oils/aromatherapy as an alternative healing option.
