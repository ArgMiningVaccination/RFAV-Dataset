This study evaluated the selfreported postvaccination side effects of inactivated virus, adenoviral vector, and mRNA COVID19 vaccines among Algerian athletes. Methods: A cross-sectional survey-based study was carried out in Algeria between March 01 and 4 April 2022. The study used a validated questionnaire with twenty-five multiple-choice items covering the participants' anamnestic characteristics, post-vaccination side effects (their onset and duration), post-vaccination medical care, and risk factors. Results: A total of 273 athletes completed the survey. Overall, (54.6%) of the athletes reported at least one local side effect, while (46.9%) reported at least one systemic side effect. These side effects were more prevalent among the adenoviral vector group compared to the inactivated virus and mRNA groups. The most common local side effect was injection site pain (29.9%), while Fever (30.8%) was the most prevalent systemic side effect. The age group of 31-40 years, allergy, previous infection with COVID-19, and the first dose of vaccines were associated with an increased risk of side effects for all groups of COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis further revealed that compared to males, the incidence of reported side effects was significantly higher in females (odd ratio (OR) = 1.16; P = 0.015*) only for the adenoviral vector vaccine group. In addition, a significantly higher percentage of athletes group of high dynamic/moderate static or high dynamic /high static components suffered from post-vaccination side effects compared to the group of athletes with high dynamic/low static components (OR = 14.68 and 14.71; P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: The adenoviral vector vaccines have the highest rate of side effects, followed by the inactivated virus and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. COVID19 vaccines were well-tolerated among Algerian athletes and there were no reports of serious side effects. Nevertheless, further long-term follow-up study with a larger sample size of athletes (from different types and sports categories) is warranted to establish the long-term safety of the COVID-19 vaccine.
