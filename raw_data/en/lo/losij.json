Innate immunity can adapt and respond more efficiently to secondary exposures, thanks to epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, namely \"trained inactivated Saccharomyces cerevisae rich in selenium includes repurposed synergistic yeast-based ingredients: a probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rich in Selenium and Zinc. ABBC1 induces trained immunity due to its specific chemical and tridimensional structure: its \u00df-glucan complex interacts with specific receptors in immune cells, provoking a release of cytokines and priming phagocytosis. Simultaneous activation of these pathways activates counteracts cytokine storm. ABBC1 provides highly bioavailable selenium and zinc, micronutrients with a critical role in an optimal immune responsiveness to allergy, infection, and vaccines. ABBC1 possesses proven microbiome modulating properties, which revert in immune training. Due to its high tolerance, safety and immediate availability, ABBC1 is an ideal candidate for complementary management of geriatric patients with seasonal influenza viruses or COVID-19, or to improve the immune response in the general population receiving the influenza or Covid-19 vaccines. The absence of drug interactions in ABBC1 allows a dosage that is fully compatible with the medication prescribed for all types of patients, including the elderly who are frequently polymedicated, and allows adding an additional therapeutic tool in the fight against the pandemic. This study assesses the benefits of a nutritional supplementation with ABBC1 in volunteers receiving the influenza vaccine during autumn 2020 and the Covid-10 vaccine during winter 2021. |Condition or disease||Intervention/treatment||Phase| Multicomponent intervention (clinical and nutritional) resulting from the administration of influenza or Covid-19 vaccine and supplementation with ABBC-1.| |Masking:||Triple ABBC-1, a Symbiotic Combination of Beta-glucans and Selenium and Zinc Enriched Probiotics, in Volunteers Receiving the Influenza or the Covid-19 Vaccines| |Actual Study Start Date :||October 29, 2020| |Actual Primary Date :||June with beta-glucan complex and Saccharomyces cerevisiae consortium | Influenza vaccine followed by 30 days of supplementation with a beta-glucan complex and Saccharomyces consortium rich in selenium and zinc | Dietary Supplement: ABBC1 Immunoessential | Powder for dissolution in water, based on a yeast beta-glucan complex and a consortium of Saccharomyces cerevisiae rich in selenium and zinc + excipents.
