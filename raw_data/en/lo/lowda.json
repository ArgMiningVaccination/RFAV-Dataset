Immunization Coverage Report for School Pupils in Ontario: 2017 -18 School Year 1 Key Messages Immunization coverage among school pupils varies by vaccine, age and health unit. Coverage estimates are dependent on the information recorded in the provincial immunization repository. Not all immunizations given to children may be captured in this system , which may result in underestimates of coverage. For most antigens, provincial -level coverage estimates do not meet Canada's national coverage goals. However, some health units have local coverage estimates that surpass the national goals. Many children w ho are not up -to-date have received some, but not all , recommended doses in a vaccine series. The overall proportion of students registering exemptions to immunizations is relatively low ; however, geographical clustering of exemptions is evident at the hea lth unit level. 85.8%86.3%85.9%85.9%96.4%87.4%87.6%7-year-olds 72.1%93.5%76.9%76.8%97.1%95.0%95.3%17-year-olds Measles Mumps Rubella Diphtheria Tetanus Polio PertussisProvincial immunization coverage for select diseases Immunization Coverage Report for School Pupils in Ontario: 2017 -18 School Year 2 Introduction Immunization coverage refers to the proportion of a population that is appropriately immunized against a vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) at a point in time. This report presents the results of Public Health Ontario (PHO) 's 2017 -18 school year assessment of immunization coverage for school pupils in Ontario. Achieving and maintaining high immunization coverage is essential for the effective prevention and control of VPDs. Accurate and timely immunization coverage assessment is essential to evaluate immunization programs, predict population-level susceptibility to VPDs and identify sub-populations with inadequate coverage that may be at risk of VPD outbreaks. The Canadian National Standards for Immunization Coverage Assessment recommend that antigen-level coverage should be reported annually for 2-, 7- and 17-year-olds, as well as for school-age programs.1 In Ontario , publicly-funded immunization programs are available for healthy infants, children, adolescents and adults, as well as high-risk individuals with particular medical conditions, behavioural risk factors or high-risk exposures.2 Vaccines administered to infan ts and young children are predominantly delivered by community-based primary health care providers, while adolescent vaccines are largely delivered by public health units (PHUs) through school-based immunization programs. Ontario's Immunization of School Pupils Act (ISPA )3,4 directs Medical Officers of Health (MOHs) of public health units (PHUs) to maintain a record of immunization for each pupil attending school in their jurisdiction. Students can be suspended if they do not receive immunizations against ISPA-designated diseases or if documentation of a medical exemption or religious/conscientious (also referred to as non- medical) exemption is not provided.3,4 Additionally, un-immunized and under-immunized students can be excluded from school if there is an outbreak or immediate risk of an outbreak of an ISPA-designated disease. Additionally Ontario's Child Care and Early Years Act (CCYEA )5,6 requires daycare operators to receive proof of immunization for children who are enrolled in child care programs. Figure 1. Designated diseases under the ISPA for the 2017 -18 school year *Applicable to children born in 2010 or laterEffective in 1982 Effective September 2014 Measles Mumps Rubella Diphtheria Polio TetanusPertussis Meningococcal Varicella* Immunization Coverage Report for School Pupils in Ontario: 2017 -18 School Year 3 In Ontario, immunization records are maintained by PHUs in the Digital Health Immunization Repository (DHIR) . Since the collection of immunization information in Ontario is driven by the ISPA and the CCYEA, the DHIR does not contain complete information for all immunizations administered to Ontario residents. As such, we are not currently able to provide timely assessments of coverage for children before school-entry, nor are we able to assess coverage among adults. Scope and Objectives For this report, we assessed coverage for all publicly-funded routine immunization programs started in infancy through adolescence, with the exception of influenza and rotavirus vaccines . The objective s of this report are: To present provincial, PHU-level and Local Health Integrated Network (LHIN)-level immunization coverage estimates for the 2017 -18 school year for Ontario's publicly-funded childhood immunization programs which include: o Immunization programs started in infancy and early childhood : measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio and pertussis for 7- ; Haemophilus influenzae (MCV4) and human papillomavirus (HPV) for 12-year-olds. To compare provincial immunization coverage estimates with nationally defined coverage goals, where relevant. To describe trends in provincial immunization programs over five school years (since the implementation of Panorama and the DHIR). To examine the proportion of 7- and 17-year-old students with n on-medical and medical immunization exemptions for diseases designated under the ISPA : o By each antigen provincially for the 2013 -14 through 2017 -18 school years . o For at least one antigen provincially and by PHU for the 2017 -18 school year. Methods For a detailed description of the provincial immunization repository (the DHIR) and methods used for the assessment of student immunization and exemption status in this report, including detailed specifications on the number and timing of vaccine doses needed to be considered up- to-date for each antigen and age milestone, please see the Technical Annex on the PHO Immunization Coverage webpage.

Trends prior to this time period are not directly comparable as complete-for-age methodology w as used for coverage assessment. Since our assessment is conducted at the antigen level, antigens included in the same multicomponent vaccines (e.g., measles, mumps and rubella containing-vaccines; diphtheria, tetanus, polio and pertussis-containing vaccines) may have very similar antigen-specific coverage estimates as seen in the overlapping lines in some graphs in this section. Antigen-specific coverage estimates are available in the data table below the graph.

Immunization Coverage Report for School Pupils in Ontario: 2017 -18 School Year 17 Discussion Our immunization coverage assessment for the 2017-18 school year shows that immunization coverage among school pupils varies depending on antigen , age group and PHU. These coverage estimates build on the previous report s of up-to-date coverage in Ontario , with five years of data now available to monitor immunization coverage trends using this methodology . Childhood Immunization Programs Started in Infancy and Early Childhood There are many factors that impact immunization coverage estimates, especially when comparing antigens assessed at both 7 a nd 17 years of age. Although vaccine uptake at these two age milestones may be reflective of secular changes in vaccination acceptance , the timing of routine immunization schedules could also explain at least some of the differences seen. For example, we expect measles coverage to be higher among 17 -year -olds compared to 7 -year -olds, as seen in the 2017 -18 school year (87.6% for 7 -year -olds provincially , 95.3% for 17 -year -olds provincially) . Following the Ontario routine schedule, all measles -containing vaccinations are completed by 7 years of age ; therefore, assessment of 17-year -olds provides 10 additional years to complete and document in the DHIR the same vaccination requirements as 7-year -olds. In contrast, the provincial coverage estimate for diphther ia is 9.1 percentage points lower among 17 -year -olds compared to 7 -year -olds (85.9% for 7 -year -olds provincially, 76.8% for 17 -year -olds provincially ). This is also an expected pattern , as an additional dose of diphtheria is needed after 7 years of age (in the form of Tdap vaccine at 14 -16 years of age ) for students to be considered up-to-date at 17 years of age . Two vaccination programs started in early childhood have seen significant improvements in coverage among 7 -year -olds since we started using up -to-date methods in the 2013 -14 school year. Coverage for MCC , a one -dose program at 12 months of age , has increased from 83.5% in the 2013 -14 school year to 94.7% in the 2017 -18 school year . Meningococcal disease was added to the list o f ISPA -designated disease s in September 2014 which likely contributed to the increasing trend . There has also been an impressive increase in coverage for the two -dose varicella program among -7 year -olds, from 24.8% in the 2013 -14 school year to 82.6% in th e 2017 -18 school year . This can be attributed, at least in part, to children born in 2010 being the first 7 -year -old cohort to have been vaccinated using a routine two -dose varicella schedule that was initiated in August 2011 , despite any child born since 2000 being eligible for two-doses .7 In addition, they are also the first 7 -year -old cohort for which varicella is designated under the ISPA , since the designation for varicella only applies to children born in 2010 or later . The programs with the lowest coverage measured at 7 years of ag e in the 2017 -18 school year are Hib (82.4%) and pneumococcal conjugate (74.1%) . Although these programs represent diseases with important morbidity and mortality for children, neither are designated under the ISPA . As such, t he Immunization Coverage Report for School Pupils in Ontario: 2017 -18 School Year 18 coverage estimates may be underestimates if some PHUs do not actively collect records of immunization for these antigens . Although vaccination programs have successfully reduced the incidence of VPDs covered in Ontario's publicly -funded early childhood immunization programs , outbreaks and sporadic cases of some of these VPDs still occur in Ontario, highlighting the importance of improving and maintaining high immunization coverage . The last case of endemic measles in Canada occurred in 1997 ;8 however, imported cases of measles continue to occur , with Ontario having an average of 14 reported measles cases annually over 2013 -2017 .9 High immunization coverage is needed to minimize the risk of transmission of this highly communicable disease.10 We have also seen an increase in cases of mumps in Ontario, with over 2 50 cases reported in 2017 alone , compared to an average of 26 cases per year reported in the 5 years prior .11 Many of these cases occurred in adults who only received one dose of mumps -containing vaccine .12 Although waning of mumps immunity following vaccination plays a role in the transmission of mumps ,13 this disease burden highlights the importance of maintaining high two -dose mumps immunization coverage. Pertussis is another VPD of concern in Ontario as it continues to be endemic, with a range of 124 to 1,265 cases reported annually between 2005 and 2017.14 The disease is most dangerous for those infants under 1 year of age who have completed their primar y series o f pertussis - containing vaccine . High overall immunization coverage is important to build up population immunity and reduce the chances of infants becoming infected with the disease .15 In addition, a targeted immunization strategy of administering a dose of pertussis -containing vaccine ( i.e., Tdap) to pregnan t women has been recently recommended by Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) to provide protection to young infants.16 Vaccines Administered in School -Based Programs Among the school -based programs, 2017 -18 school year provincial coverage at 12 years of age is highest for MCV4 (82.4%) , with coverage 22.5 percentage points higher than HPV (59.9%) . MCV4 coverage is likely the highest of these programs as the v accine series requires only one dose. The high degree of public concern around meningococcal disease also likely leads to high acceptability for this vaccine and it is the only school -based immunization program that is also designated under the ISPA . Grade 7 students are eligible for one dose of MCV4 vaccine through Ontario's school -based program and remain eligible until the vaccine is received (i.e., eligibility in perpetuity). The other two school -based immunization programs offer two doses of hepatitis B vaccine and two doses of HPV vaccine to Grade 7 students . A student who misse s one or both doses of either vaccine in Grade 7 are eligible to receive publicly -funded vaccines as part of extended eligibility program s until the end of their Grade 8 year for hepatitis B and until the end of their Grade 12 year for HPV .2 Although coverage estimates for all three school -based programs in Ontario are currently below the national coverage goals, our analysis of Grade 7 students does not incorporate doses delivered after Grade 7 . In the 2017 -18 school year, 83.3% and 72.3% of students initiated the hepatitis B and HPV vaccine series compared to the coverage (series completion) estimates of 69.2% and 59.9% respectively . It is anticipated that coverage may be higher for vaccines gi ven in school -based programs if doses given after Grade 7 were to be included in future assessment s. Immunization Coverage Report for School Pupils in Ontario: 2017 -18 School Year 19 School -based vaccine delivery serves as an important platform to achieve high immunization coverage among a dolescents who tend to have a low frequency of health care provider visits for preventive care .31,32 Delivering these vaccines through school -based clinics removes some of the barriers to access and contributes to improving equity in immuni zation uptake.17,18 It should be noted that the school - based immunization programs, particu larly hepatitis B and HPV, have some of the lowest coverage estimates at the provincial -level , leaving Ontarians at risk for these diseases that are associate d with significant morbidity and mortality. Vaccination against HPV has been shown to substantiall y reduce the risk of anal and genital warts, cervical cancer and other genitourinary cancers in both males and females ;19 the h epatitis B vaccine series is 95% to 100% effective in preventing infection with the hepatitis B virus which can lead to chronic complications including serious liver disease;20 and a lthough rare, i nvasive meningococcal disease has a high case fataility rate (10% of cases ) and the potential for long -term sequelae.21 While the safety and efficacy of the vaccines delivered through school -based programs have been established, further work is needed to better understand how to impr ove coverage for these programs. Geographic Variability There is considerable variability in coverage estimates across PHUs , as indicated in Appendix 1 of this report, highlighting that some areas within the province may be at greater risk for certain VPDs than others. In the 2017 -18 school year, the greatest range between the highest and lowest PHU coverage estimates was 34 percentage points , which occurred for varicella among 7 -year -olds.This is a substantial improvement f rom the 2016 -17 school year assessment, where there was a range of 70 percentage points for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis among 17 -year -olds. This narrowing of the difference between PHUs in the 2017 -18 school year is the direct result of PHUs with very low coverage estimates in the 2016 -17 school year showing substantial improvements in their reported estimates in the 2017 - 18 school year. Improvements in reported coverage could be indicative of higher immunization uptake in these areas or may be due to better data collection, as v ariability in ISPA assessment and enforcement activities within the PHU are known to influence the completeness of immunization information within the DHIR . Other reasons for the variability in coverage estimates among PHUs may be explained by factors such as immunization delivery practices and community level influences on immunization acceptance. Coverage Goals In this report, Ontario's provincial coverage estimates are compared to Canada's national coverage goals , whi ch were updated in 2017 as part of the National Immunization Strategy objectives for 2016 - 2021.22 The national vaccination coverage goals were developed follo wing a review of international standards and best practices. Of note, t he national goals were set to be achieved by 2025 and are being compared to provincial coverage estimates for the 2017 -18 school year . As well, t he specifications (e.g. , dose requiremen ts) of some of the national goals align with the provincial up -to-date coverage specifications better than others , and differences in specifications are an additional consideration when making comparisons between provincial estimates and national goals . The provincial coverage estimates Immunization Coverage Report for School Pupils in Ontario: 2017 -18 School Year 20 for the 2017 -18 school year, with the exceptions of rubella at 7 years of age and measles, mumps and rubella at 17 years of age, do not meet Canada's newly revised national coverage goals; however, it should be noted that ma ny PHUs have local coverage estimates which surpassed the national goals for various antigens and ages assessed. Immunization Exemptions Although the overall proportion of students with non-medical exemptions at the provincial level is relatively low and medical exemptions are very rare, further work is needed to understand the characteristics of students with exemptions. Previous work in Ontario has found that s tudents with ISPA exemption s are not necessarily unimmunized and that parents seek out non -medical exemptions for a diverse set of reasons.23 By adding analyses of exemptions to the coverage report this 2017 -18 school year (including the a nalyse s of exemptions from the 2013 -14 to 2016 -17 school year) , we now have five years of data from which we can monitor changes in exemptions in the province over time. Notes on Interpretation The coverage estimates summarized within this report should be considered in the context of Ontario's immunization system, which is complex and involves multiple providers and organizations within both the primary care and public health sectors. With the exce ption of the three school -based adolescent programs primarily delivered by local PHUs, the vast majority of infant and childhood immunizations are delivered by community -based health care providers ; however, the responsibility for immunization surveillance activities for all antigens analyzed in this report rests with local PHUs. In Ontario, local PHUs obtain immunization information from parents and guardians , who are responsible for reporting their child's immunization records to the PHU . Parents and gua rdians may only become aware of their responsibility to report this information when their child starts attending school or after being notified by their local PHU that their child has vaccine doses outstanding based on information available to the PHU . Thus, both PHU assessment activities and reporting by parents and guardians are important contributors to the completeness of immunization information included in this report. As such , it is possible that some coverage estimates may be underestimates if not all vaccine doses that have been administered have been captured within the DHIR . There are several other important influences on immunization coverage surveillance that deserve mention. In Ontario, immunization coverage surveillance activities are focused on school -age children, as the ISPA provid es the legislative authority for the collection of immunization information regarding children and adolescents who attend primary and secondary school s in Ontario . Since the population lists uploaded in to the DHIR to identify local school children are based on school board and other school attendance lists, c hildren who attend non-traditional schools (e.g. , are home -schooled or have dropped out of school ) may not be fully represented in the data for this report. Although the CCYEA includes immunization reporting requirements,5,6 we are unable to report on immunization coverage prior to school entry , for example at two years of age (an important national and international age milestone for coverage assessment ), because not all Ontario children attend child care facilities. Immunization Coverage Report for School Pupils in Ontario: 2017 -18 School Year 21 For further details about the limitations of the data presented within this report, please see the Technical Annex . Conclusion s Immunization coverage assessment in Ontario is driven by provincial legislation and the dedication and collective efforts of immunization providers, schools, parents and guardians, and public health professionals across the province . This work has enabled Public Health Ontario to calculate up -to-date coverage estimates for five consecutive school years at the provincial and PHU -level . These coverage estimates support examin ation of recent temporal trends in immunization coverage and contribute to ongoing work by public health units and other stakeholders to better understand immunization acceptance and uptake.24 As high im munization coverage is essential for preventing morbidity and mortality from VPDs, robust immunization information systems ensure immunization coverage estimates are monitored in a timely and accurate manner. In this 2017 -18 school year immunization cover age report, we have seen successes including increasing MCC and varicella coverage throughout the province . Although there are programs that fall short of national coverage goals , many PHU -level coverage estimates surpass the coverage goals for various antigens and ages of assessment . In addition, there have been notable reductions in the range of PHU coverage estimates between the highest and lowest PHUs for the 2017 -18 school year. Our routine and standardized assessment of immunization coverage in Ontario provides essential data to support immunization program planning a t the PHU and provincial -level.
