In this study, a PCV2d vaccine candidate was selected, and its protective efficacy against the PCV2d isolate was evaluated. From 2016 to 2020, 234 PCV2d isolates were phylogenetically analyzed using open reading frame 2 (ORF2) sequences and classified into four subgroups: PCV2d-1, PCV2d-2, PCV2d-3, and PCV2d-4. Except for PCV2d-4, which consisted of ungrouped isolates, the three subgroups showed distinct differences at amino acid positions 53 and 169 in the ORF2. The detection rates of PCV2d-1, PCV2d-2, and PCV2d-3 were 36.5, 37.4, and 3.7%, respectively, and representative isolates were selected from each subgroup (QIA244, QIA126, and QIA169, respectively). In the neutralization assay, QIA244 showed the lowest neutralization efficiency among the three PCV2a-based vaccines, whereas the virus-like particles of QIA244 (rQIA244) provided broader protection against the three genotypes than did those of QIA126 and rQIA169. To further evaluate rQIA244 in pigs, the experimental groups were divided into rQIA244-vaccine (2dVac), commercial PCV2a-vaccine (2aVac), and no-vaccination (noVac) groups. The 2dVac effectively reduced the copy number of PCV2d in blood and tissues, as well as in tissue lesions, compared to the effect of 2aVac. Collectively, 2dVac provided by QIA244 ORF2 successfully demonstrated protective efficacy against the currently prevalent PCV2d in vitro neutralization and in vivo assays.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-09-01", "cleaned_text": "Selection and Evaluation of Porcine circovirus (PCV) 2d Vaccine Strains to Protect against Currently Prevalent PCV2 [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11091447](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11091447) [Veterinary Research in which PCV2, PCV3, and PCV4. It is a single-stranded circular DNA virus with an icosahedral symmetric capsid (cap). Among the various types of Porcine circoviruses, PCV2 is the most common and important etiological agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) and is responsible for significant economic losses [ [3](#B3-vaccines-11-01447)]. Over the last decade, its prevalence has increased, posing a major threat to the swine industry [ [4](#B4-vaccines-11-01447)]. [5](#B5-vaccines-11-01447), [6](#B6-vaccines-11-01447), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-01447)]. The genotype shifts are a notable phenomenon among the different genotypes of PCV2. A genotype shift from PCV2a to PCV2b and, more recently, to PCV2d, has occurred in major pork-producing countries, including South Korea [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-01447), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-01447), [10](#B10-vaccines-11-01447), [11](#B11-vaccines-11-01447)]. In a recent study on PCV2 prevalence in South Korea between 2016 and 2020, PCV2d accounted for approximately 90% of cases [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-01447)]. This shift between PCV2 genotypes has led to outbreaks and vaccine failures in the global swine industry [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-01447), [14](#B14-vaccines-11-01447)]. [15](#B15-vaccines-11-01447)]. The orf2 gene of PCV2a has a high degree of similarity to that of PCV2b but differs significantly from that of PCV2d, which has spread rapidly throughout the world. Owing to its immunogenicity, this cap protein is a target for PCV2 vaccine development [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-01447)]. [17](#B17-vaccines-11-01447)]. However, the currently circulating genotypes differ from the vaccine genotypes. Although PCV2a-based commercial vaccines provide protection against viral challenges, they fail to reduce the viral load in the blood and tissues. The immunogenic antigens of many commercial PCV vaccines are recombinant proteins containing the PCV2a cap protein produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. Although the manufacturer suggested that PCV2a-based vaccines provide cross-protection against PCV2d, the prevalence of PCV2d in the field cannot be prevented using PCV2a-based vaccines. Previous studies have shown that commercial PCV2a-based vaccines neutralize PCV2b isolates better than PCV2d isolates do [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01447)]. Experimental evidence from controlled trials also supports the idea that homologous vaccines are more effective than heterologous ones at reducing viremia in concurrent PCV2a and PCV2d challenges [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-01447)]. Therefore, vaccines with circulating genotypes are needed. [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01447)]. Designing a vaccine tailored to a specific genotype circulating in a country can help reduce vaccine costs and effectively target prevalent strains. To date, no study has compared recombinant PCV2d-VLP with commercially available PCV2a-based vaccines. In this study, we investigated the ability of a PCV2d vaccine to provide broad protection against PCV2 infection and evaluated the efficacy of the PCV2d vaccine against PCV2d challenge in vivo. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Viruses and Cells [12](#B12-vaccines-11-01447)]. To analyze the genetic relation between the PCV2d isolates detected from pig farms in Korea, we performed multiple sequence alignments using the CLC Main and PCV-free PK15 cells as previously described [ [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01447)]. 2.2. Production Recombinant VLP [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01447)]. PCV2 VLPs ORF2 genes from the QIA244, QIA126, and QIA169 strains, respectively. 2.3. Guinea Pig Immunization 2.4. Pig Studies [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-01447-f001)). Two groups were vaccinated with 2dVac carbomer) and 2aVac (the commercial PCV2a genotype-based vaccine), while the other group served as the noVac group (not vaccinated). All groups were co-challenged with PCV2d (QIA244 genotype) and PRRSV-1 (European type) at 6 weeks of age and euthanized at 21 days after the challenge (dpc), as described previously [ [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01447)]. The animal study was approved by the KBNP Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approval number; KBNP 20-6). 2.5. Clinical Signs and Body Weight 2.6.

Analysis of Cap Proteins in the Recently Prevalent PCV2d [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-01447-f002)a and [Figure S1](#app1-vaccines-11-01447)). In the amino acid sequence alignment of ORF2, the PCV2d strains showed differences of approximately 10% (similarity: and (similarity: 92.8-93.1%) compared PCV2a and PCV2b, respectively. However, the inter-PCV2d isolates showed a less than 1% difference (similarity: 99.3-99.9%). Despite high conservation, the ORF2 sequences of the PCV2d isolates showed distinct differences at positions 53 (F or I) and 169 (R or G) ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-01447-f002)b). Among the 234 PCV2d isolates, the detection rate of PCV2d-1 and PCV2d-2 73.9% [Figure In low detection rates 8.6% in 2017 and 7.0% in 2018 (3.7%). PCV2d-4, which was included in the three groups, had an average of 22.4% and showed random mutations throughout the orf2 gene sequence without grouping based on the difference between positions 53 and 169. 3.1.2. Neutralization of Commercial PCV2a-Based Vaccines against PCV2 Strains [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-01447-f003)). The results showed that the neutralization efficiencies against QIA215 and QIA418 were above 95% for vaccines A, B, and C. However, the neutralization efficacies varied among the three PCV2d strains. The three PCV2a-based vaccines neutralized up to 33.7% of the QIA244 of PCV2d-1 and up to 60% of the QIA126 of PCV2d-2. In contrast, QIA169 from the PCV2d-3 subgroup showed a viral neutralization (VN) 93.4 used to immunize guinea pigs. First, NA titers were determined by VNT90 using antisera from guinea pigs immunized with rQIA244, rQIA126, or rQIA169 against the corresponding were 8192 anti-rQIA169 sera (n = 3). Subsequently, the five PCV2 strains were neutralized against their respective VNT90 titers. The results showed that all PCV2 field strains neutralized by 90% using QIA418, but only a 43.9% and a of and QIA126, [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-01447-f001)). The protective efficacy of the 2dVAC was compared with that of a commercially available PCV2a-based vaccine (2aVac). 3.2.1. Evaluation of Vaccine Efficacy against PCV2d Challenge [Supplementary S2](#app1-vaccines-11-01447)). Similarly, the \u00b1 0.21 groups was slightly lower than group (0.67 \u00b1 0.13 kg/day) ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-11-01447-f005)a). However, were no significant differences between the groups. [Figure 5](#vaccines-11-01447-f005)b). At 21 dpc, PCV2 genomes were detected in the lung (0.07 \u00b1 0.04 copies), tonsil (0.03 \u00b1 0.01 copies), mesenteric \u00b1 3.8 copies), and inguinal LN (0.02 \u00b1 0.01 copies) of the 2dVac group. A slightly higher number of PCV2 genomes was detected in the 2aVac group (3.3 \u00b1 1.3 in the lung, 5.8 \u00b1 1.8 in the tonsil, 1017 \u00b1 7.0 \u00b1 inguinal LN) but without statistical significance. The noVac group showed significantly higher levels of PCV2 genomes than did the other groups (73 \u00b1 33 in the lung, 272 \u00b1 130 in 18,815 In addition, lung lesion scores were significantly different (p < 0.05) between the 2dVac and 2aVac groups, with interstitial pneumonia being the main observation ( [Supplementary Figure S3c](#app1-vaccines-11-01447)). The microscopic lesions of the lung, tonsil, and mesenteric LN of the 2dVac group were not scored and were only slightly observed in inguinal LN (0.3 The lesion scores of the lungs were significantly (p < 0.05) different between the 2dVac (0.0 \u00b1 0.0) and 2aVac (1.0 \u00b1 0.2) groups; however, the scores of other tissues did not differ significantly between these two groups. Meanwhile, the scores of the 2dVac and 2aVac groups were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than those of the noVac group (2.0 \u00b1 0.3, 1.8 \u00b1 0.2, 1.8 \u00b1 0.2, and 1.8 \u00b1 0.2) in all four tissues. In the histopathological analysis, mild or moderate peribronchial lymphocyte regeneration ( and macrophage proliferation in the tonsils and two LNs were mainly observed in the 2aVac and noVac groups ( respectively) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those of 2aVac (512 \u00b1 314, 614 \u00b1 388, 819 \u00b1 85 \u00b1 33, and 8.0 \u00b1 0.0, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in the NA titers between 2aVac and noVac against [10](#B10-vaccines-11-01447), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-01447), [22](#B22-vaccines-11-01447)]. Despite the continuous use of the PCV2 vaccine in Korea, PCV2 remains prevalent, with most of the detected genotypes being PCV2d. Therefore, the protective efficacy of PCV2a-based vaccines against PCV2d field strains must be evaluated. [23](#B23-vaccines-11-01447)]. It has been speculated that PCV2d may escape the protection provided by PCV2a vaccines [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-01447), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-01447), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-01447)]. In our previous study, we confirmed the antigenic differences between PCV2a and PCV2d by cross-neutralization experiments using PCV2 genotypes vaccines, PCV2a and PV2d in the orf2 nucleotide and the amino acid sequence encoding the cap protein, which is known to be antigenic. Most of these mutations were located in the epitope region described in previous studies [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-01447), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01447), [26](#B26-vaccines-11-01447)]. Furthermore, neutralization experiments were performed on PCV2a, PCV2b, and PCV2d isolates using antisera from three commercial PCV2a-based vaccines, as shown in [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-01447-f003). However, the three PCV2d isolates exhibited different neutralization efficiencies. This finding was consistent with the results of the national PCV2d genotyping analysis conducted between 2016 and 2020 ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-01447-f002)c). Specifically, the detection rate was high in the group containing QIA244 and QIA126, which showed low neutralization efficiencies against the PCV2a vaccine sera, and the detection rate was low in the group containing QIA169. Therefore, the PCV2d field strains with a low protective efficacy against current commercial PCV2a-based vaccines are prevalent. [27](#B27-vaccines-11-01447)]. However, PCV2d differed from PCV2b by approximately 7% in both the nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The amino acid homology among the currently prevalent PCV2d isolates in Korea was approximately 98%, with differences of one or two amino acids among the 234 amino acids of the ORF2 protein, as shown in [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-01447-f002)b. Despite these slight differences in amino acid sequences, the antisera of the PCV2a vaccines showed different degrees of neutralization efficacy against the QIA244 (0-33.7%), QIA126 (0-60.0%), and QIA169 (93.4-95.6%) isolates. The mutations ORF2 among PCV2d isolates mainly involve differences between isoleucine (I) or phenylalanine (F) at position 53 and arginine (R) or glycine (G) at position 169. In particular, QIA169, which showed high neutralization efficacy with the PCV2a vaccine, had F at position 53 and differed from G and S at position 169. Conversely, QIA244 and QIA126, which showed low neutralization efficiencies, contained I at position 53, R in QIA244, and G in QIA126 at position 169. Overall, the difference in neutralization efficiency between the PCV2a vaccine and the PCV2d isolates was likely due to the amino acid at position 53. Previous reports have highlighted the antigenic differences resulting from single amino acid sequence variations [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-01447)], and two amino acid sites (53 and 169) located within the putative epitopes [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-01447)]. The difference in antigen-antibody reactivity may be due to a change in the three-dimensional conformation of the cap protein resulting from a single amino acid mutation. Therefore, further investigation is required to understand the effect of sequence variations at positions 53 and 169 on conformational changes in the cap protein and the resulting differences in antigenicity. [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-01447-f002)a). PCV2d-3 showed a low detection rate from 2017 to 2018 and has not been detected since then. A cross-neutralization test with PCV2d isolates showed that antiserum from guinea pigs immunized with QIA244, a representative strain of the PCV2d-1 group, provided broad protective immunity against PCV2a, PCV2b, and other PCV2d isolates. However, QIA126, representing PCV2d-2, showed relatively low protective ability against QIA244, and QIA169 showed low protective immunity against the other PCV2d isolates. However, all three isolates were highly protective against PCV2a and PCV2b. Based on these findings, we determined that QIA244, which showed effective protective immunity against all PCV2a, PCV2b, and PCV2d genotypes, was the most suitable vaccine. [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01447)]. In this study, we evaluated the protective efficacy of PCV2d and PCV2a vaccines against PCV2d isolates. As shown in [Figure 5](#vaccines-11-01447-f005), both 2dVac and 2aVac provided effective protection against the challenge with PCV2d (QIA244 isolate). In the 2dVac group, no virus was detected in the lungs, tonsils, or inguinal LNs, and only a small amount of the PCV2d antigen was detected in the mesenteric LNs. No significant lesions were observed in the lungs. Compared to the noVac group, the 2aVac group also showed protection against PCV2d; however, the PCV2d antigen was detected in the tissues, and significant lesions were observed in the lungs. In the cross-neutralization experiment using antiserum collected 3 weeks after vaccination, the antiserum from the PCV2d vaccine showed higher NA titers against PCV2a, PCV2b, and PCV2d than did the antiserum from the PCV2a vaccine. This may be due to the different compositions of PCV2d and PCV2a vaccines such as adjuvants and antigen doses (200 \u00b5g vs. 20 \u00b5g, respectively). Regardless of the homologous genotype, QIA169 and QIA244 of PCV2d isolates showed lower and 6.8-fold, respectively) and QIA418 (1.7-fold and 5.7-fold, respectively) in the antiserum of 2dVac. This may be derived from antigenic difference between genotypes [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-01447)]. The monoclonal antibody used in this study was produced through the immunization of PCV2a. Therefore, the antigen-antibody reactivity can be relatively low against PCV2d isolates. The NA titers of the PCV2a vaccine were approximately 8-fold lower against QIA215, QIA418 and QIA169, and approximately 32-fold lower against the challenge strain QIA244 (PCV2d) than those of the PCV2d vaccine. The low NA titer of the antiserum derived from the PCV2a-based vaccine against QIA244 contributed to the pathogenicity of PCV2d strains in pigs and their continued circulation in pig farms. 5.
