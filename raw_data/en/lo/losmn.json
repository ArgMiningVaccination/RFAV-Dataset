Any grocer is allowed to purchase wireless EBT equipment which makes curbside pick-up possible. - Information for Retailers - Current SNAP-eligible retailers interested in participating in online EBT purchases should visit [the USDA website](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/retailer-requirements-provide-online-purchasing)for more information, including program requirements and instructions for enrollment. Post-Secondary Student Eligibility The Office for Family Independence (OFI) has created a [Community College Verification Form (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/sites/maine.gov.dhhs/files/inline-files/Community-College-Verification-Form%20v4.pdf) to simplify verifying SNAP eligibility for post-secondary students at community colleges. Community colleges can verify students are enrolled in an associate's degree or certificate program that is considered a \"career or technical education program\", as defined by the federal Carl D. Perkins Act (most certificate and associate degree programs fit the definition), OR a course the community college has determined will make the student more employable. This information has been conveyed to Navigators at community colleges so that they are better able to assist OFI in the fight to reduce hunger. Navigators are campus based staff who assist eligible students throughout their time in school. Able-bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) Able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) can receive SNAP for only 3 months in a 3-year period if they do not meet certain work requirements. To learn more about ABAWD requirements and exemptions visit the [USDA Food and Nutrition Service SNAP Work Requirements page](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/work-requirements). SNAP Quality Control Review The SNAP Quality Control Review team is a federally mandated group of OFI specialists that thoroughly reviews more than 1,100 randomly selected SNAP households every year. SNAP has one of the most rigorous quality control systems in the federal government. The SNAP quality control system measures how accurately SNAP state agencies determine a household's eligibility and benefit amount. It consists of both state agency reviews and federal reviews. Quality Control Reviews are used to determine if: - The SNAP program is being run according to regulations. - The local office handled the case correctly. - The information in the case file is correct. - The client is getting the benefits they are eligible for. All written communication from OFI's SNAP Quality Control Review team is on OFI's letterhead. Phone number of the office and the worker are included as well as the workers full name and State of Maine email address. Federal law states that selected clients must cooperate with the SNAP Quality Control Review. If a client does not give the detailed information requested and/or cooperate with the review, their SNAP case may be closed. Additional information regarding SNAP Quality Control Review can be found on the USDA website, [https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/quality-control](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/quality-control) USDA Non Discrimination Statement In accordance with federal civil rights law and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) civil rights regulations and policies, this institution is prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), religious creed, disability, age, political beliefs, or reprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights activity.
