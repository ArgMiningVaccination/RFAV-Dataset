All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our [coronavirus hub](/coronavirus) for the most recent information on COVID-19. The Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow, Russia, developed a COVID-19 vaccine called Gam-COVID-Vac, more commonly known as Sputnik V. It is the first COVID-19 vaccine in the world to be authorized for use against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Along with Russia, [64](https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/vaccines/12/) countries have approved the vaccine. These countries include Argentina, Iran, and India. The vaccine is currently being reviewed in the European Union by the [European Medicines Agency](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-rolling-review-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine). Sputnik V is a two-part adenovirus viral vector vaccine with an efficacy rate of [91.6%](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00234-8/fulltext#seccestitle150) [Adenoviruses](/articles/adenovirus-infection#_noHeaderPrefixedContent) are a type of virus associated with the [common cold](/articles/166606) and other illnesses. They serve as the delivery vehicle for the DNA instructions to produce the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the body. This then triggers the production of antibodies against this spike protein, preparing the [immune system](/articles/320101) for a potential infection. Each of the two doses uses a different type of adenovirus: first dose with type-26 (Ad26), then a booster dose with type-5 (Ad5). The purpose of using two different types is to lower the possibility of the body developing antibodies against the adenovirus after the first dose, which could make the second dose ineffective. The [Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download) Article summary: An interim analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data, published in [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00234-8/fulltext#seccestitle150) These side effects are similar to those of the [Pfizer](/articles/pfizer-vaccine-for-covid-19-what-are-the-side-effects), [Moderna](/articles/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-what-to-know-about-side-effects), and [Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines](/articles/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-what-are-the-side-effects), as noted by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html) Authors of the paper state that [45](https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00234-8/attachment/5b392723-a191-4fd1-b36a-f0b5603ca1dd/mmc1.pdf) [deep vein thrombosis](/articles/153704), [hemorrhagic stroke](/articles/317111), and [hypertension](/articles/150109). However, according to the paper, the independent data monitoring committee has confirmed that none of these were considered related to the vaccine. Despite these data, there is still a significant controversy surrounding the vaccine. [Experts](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n743) An article published in [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00899-0/fulltext) Adenoviruses, in their natural state, are able to replicate in the body and lead to illnesses, such as the common cold. When used in vaccines, adenoviruses are altered to remove their ability to replicate. For the Sputnik V vaccine, it was noted that the E1 gene was removed from the vaccine in order to prevent replication. However, Brazil recently rejected the use of Sputnik V, citing concerns around replication. According to [Anvisa](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/russias-covid-19-vaccine-safe-brazils-veto-sputnik-v-sparks-lawsuit-threat-and) Shortly after, the [Gamaleya National Center](https://sputnikvaccine.com/newsroom/pressreleases/sputnik-v-statement-on-brazilian-health-regulator-anvisa-s-decision-to-postpone-authorization/) released a press statement denying Anvisa's allegations, referring to Brazil's decisions as being \"of a political nature and [having] nothing to do with the regulator's access to information or science.\" It stated that only non-replicating adenoviruses are incorporated in the vaccine, and pointed to other strict aspects of quality control. Scientists have displayed mixed responses, with some criticizing Russia's lack of transparency and others questioning Anvisa's interpretation of the data. In the case that the adenovirus is able to replicate, the likely side effects are a mild common cold for most people. For people with weakened immune systems, the risks may be greater. After CanSino released phase 1 clinical trial data on Convidecia, another Ad5-based COVID-19 vaccine, [researchers raised concerns](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32156-5/fulltext) According to a [2008 study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)61591-3/fulltext) While further research is needed to validate this claim, the researchers advise precaution against using Ad5-based COVID-19 vaccines, particularly in areas of the world with a high number of HIV and AIDS cases.
