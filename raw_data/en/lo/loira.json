Special Opportunities Degree programs in public health balance theoretical knowledge with professional experience through internships and opportunities to work with faculty on research projects. Careers Public interest is increasing the demand for public health professionals. The work of a public health professional is diverse and includes activities such as documenting the spread of disease and illness, developing and managing programs designed to change health-related behaviors, implementing regulatory initiatives, and working with policy makers to facilitate societal changes that promote well-being. Public health careers can be found in local, state, and federal government; nonprofit organizations; businesses and corporations; hospitals; county health departments; universities; and with health foundations and health-based grant projects. A public health degree can lead to career such as: Biostatistician Disease Prevention Manager Environmental Health Specialist Health Data Analyst Health Promotion Specialist Maternal and Child Health Specialist Public Health Educator Public Health Epidemiologist Public Health Researcher Sexual Health Educator Technical Advisor for HIV/AIDS ProgramsJuly 20, 2023 31 Vaccine Advisor and Program Manager Youth Tobacco Prevention Coordinator Bachelor of Science in Health & Wellness Design, Recreational Therapy Major Description of Program Degree Requirements Special Opportunities Careers Description of Program The recreational therapy major prepares students to assume positions as recreational therapists. All students graduating from this program are eligible to sit for the National Council on Therapeutic Recreation Certification (NCTRC) examination. The Recreational therapy program is accrediated through the Commission on Accrediatation of Allied Health Education (CAAHEP) and the Committee on Accrediatation of Recreational Therapy Education (CARTE). The Bureau of Labor Statistics describes the field of recreational therapy as follows: \"Recreational therapists, also referred to as therapeutic recreation specialists, provide treatment services and recreation activities for individuals with disabilities or illnesses. Using a variety of techniques, including arts and crafts, animals, sports, games, dance and movement, drama, music, and community outings, therapists improve and maintain the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of their clients. Therapists help individuals reduce depression, stress, and anxiety; recover basic motor functioning and reasoning abilities; build confidence; and socialize effectively so that they can enjoy greater independence and reduce or eliminate the effects of their illness or disability. In addition, therapists help people with disabilities integrate into the community by teaching them how to use community resources and recreational activities. Recreational therapists are different from recreation workers, who organize recreational activities primarily for enjoyment. In acute healthcare settings, such as hospitals and rehabilitation centers, recreational therapists treat and rehabilitate individuals with specific health conditions, usually in conjunction or collaboration with physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, and physical and occupational therapists. In long-term and residential care facilities, recreational therapists use leisure activities\u2014 especially structured group programs\u2014to improve and maintain their clients' general health and well-being. They also may provide interventions to prevent the client from suffering further medical problems and complications.\" Degree Requirements This is a four-year program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Health & Wellness Design with a major in Recreational Therapy.

Careers According to the National Recreation and Park Association, a career in Parks, Recreation, & the Outdoors (PRO) means enhancing the quality of life for all people through advancing environmental conservation efforts, social equity, and health and wellness. The job outlook for PRO graduates is excellent. The U.S. Department of Labor bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that employment of recreation workers is projected to grow 10 percent from 2019 to 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations. As more emphasis is placed on the importance of lifelong well-being, more recreation workers will be needed to work with children and adults in a variety of settings. The Department of Health & Wellness Design prepares a monthly nationwide listing of jobs in the field totaling more than 1,500 potential positions for graduates annually. A large number of transferable skills are developed through the PRO program from personnel, facility, site, financial/fiscal, and natural resource management to research methods. PRO students also develop skills in promoting justice, equity, diversity, accessibility, and inclusion in the sites where they work. These skills prepare students for a wide range of careers. Many PRO graduates go on to pursue advanced degrees including the Master of Science (M.S.) in Recreation with options in Outdoor Recreation or Recreation Administration, Master of Public Health (M.P.H) in Parks and Recreation, and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Leisure Behavior.

The AP combines the ACEND-accredited four-year undergraduate Bachelor of Science in Applied Health Science, Dietetics, degree with the two-year Master of Science in Applied Health Science, Nutrition Science, degree. The result is a pathway that enables enrolled AP students to complete both a B.S. and an M.S. degree in five years instead of the usual six years. The one-year savings of time and expense is possible because of four overlap courses that count toward both degrees. Interested students already admitted to IUB as dietetics majors can apply to the AP during their junior year. A minimum GPA of 3.2 is preferred. Applicants must also meet requirements for the M.S. degree. IU offers the AP in dietetics as an investment in the future of students seeking careers as RDNs, the credentialed professional in the field of dietetics. There are multiple steps to becoming an RDN: 1.Fulfill dietetics educational competencies established by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). 2.Obtain the minimum of a master's degree.* 3.Complete a supervised practice experience through an ACEND-accredited institution. 4.Successfully pass the national RD exam. The undergraduate dietetics major provides the educational foundation for students seeking careers as RDNs; adding the graduate degree enables AP graduates to complete the first two steps toward RD exam eligibility at IUB. AP students pay undergraduate tuition for the four overlap courses, which are graduate courses taken by AP students while they are still undergraduates. AP students complete the bachelor's degree with the rest of the senior class, then complete the master's degree in one additional year. Graduates who successfully complete the AP at Indiana University are eligible to apply to an ACEND- accredited supervised practice program, after which they can take the national RD exam. *Notice from the Commission on Dietetic Registration: Effective January 1, 2024, the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) will require a minimum of a master's degree to be eligible to take the credentialing exam to become a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). In order to be approved for registration examination eligibility with a bachelor's degree, an individual must meet all eligibility requirements and be submitted into CDR'sRegistration Eligibility Processing System (REPS) before 12:00 midnight Central Time, December 31, 2023. For more information about this requirement visit CDR's website: www.cdrnet.org/graduatedegree . In addition, CDR requires that individuals complete coursework and supervised practice in program(s) accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). Degree Requirements AP students complete the same four-year program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Applied Health Science, Dietetics, degree except that the four overlap courses are taken as 500-level graduate courses instead of the usual 400-level courses taken by undergraduates. AP students complete a minimum of 143 credits for both degrees. Graduation requirements for the B.S. degree include: completion of general education requirements established by IU completion of dietetics major requirements a minimum of 120 successfully completed credit hours that count toward the undergraduate degree program a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA No Pass/Fail courses except for free electives During their senior year, AP students are matched with graduate faculty who will serve as advisors for the non-thesis project required for the master's degree. Completion of a research thesis is also possible, but completion of the master's degree might then take longer than one additional year. Graduation requirements for the M.S. degree include: completion of a minimum of 35 graduate credit hours a minimum 3.0 cumulative grade point average a minimum grade of C in each required course General Education (20 - 39 credits) All undergraduate students must complete the IU Bloomington campus-wide general education common ground requirements.

However, the undergraduate dietetics program has strong outcomes, with a 93% placement rate of alums into supervised practice programs and >95% one-year passage rate on the national RD exam since the year 2000. Careers RDNs may work in clinical settings such as hospitals, long term care facilities, nutrition clinics, or private practice; serve on a health care team; or work one-on-one with people in the treatment and prevention of disease. Community-based RDNs counsel individuals and groups on nutritional practices designed to prevent disease and promote health. Management RDNs often oversee large-scale meal planning and preparation in health care facilities, schools, universities, restaurant chains, or private industry. A growing number of RDNs work in business, journalism, marketing, sports nutrition, and corporate wellness programs. Dietitians who enjoy research may lead or consult on clinical research studies within academic centers, medical facilities, or governmental organizations, or they may prefer the food industry, where they can research and develop food products, services, or educational programs. With advanced degrees, dietitians may pursue careers in higher education. Accelerated Programs MSAHS Nutrition MS - Dietetics BS Advising & Registration Advising and Registration Each student will be assigned an academic advisor at the beginning of their academic career with SPH. All phases of the student's program are subject to the approval of the advisor. All graduate students are required to meet with their advisor before registering for classes each term. During each of these meetings, a student and advisor identify theJuly 20, 2023 109 courses in which the student will enroll for the following term. An advising hold will be placed on all student accounts at the beginning of each semester to prevent enrollment in the following semester until an advising meeting has taken place and all courses are approved by the student's advisor. Procedures for Maintaining Enrollment It is the student's responsibility to meet with their advisor before registration for each new semester, make a course plan for the upcoming semester, and have the Academic Advisor Course Registration Approval Form approved by their advisor. This is a requirement for all SPH students, and this step must be completed prior to enrollment each semester. The form can be found here: https://one.iu.edu/task/ iub/current-sph-students by pressing \"Start\" and then selecting the \"Forms\" link. Once the advisor approves the electronic form, it will route to the staff member in Degree Administration assigned to graduate student services, after which the hold will be removed and confirmation and further instructions will be sent to the student. Independent Study, Readings, and Research courses require a form and prospectus (1-2 pages detailing the specific work the student is performing for the course). The form can be found here: https://one.iu.edu/task/ iub/current-sph-students by pressing \"Start\" and then selecting the \"Forms\" link. Once the advisor and course instructor approve the electronic form, it will route to the staff member in Degree Administration assigned to graduate student services, after which the hold will be removed and confirmation and further instructions will be sent to the student. Students should consult their advisor and/or the instructor of the Independent Study course for advice on formulating the required prospectus. Graduate students must have a 3.0 GPA to enroll in any independent study courses. Other Tools to maintain enrollment: Students can access the IUB Official academic calendar here to see schedules and deadlines for each semester: https://utilities.registrar.indiana.edu/calendars/official- calendar/ Students can access Student Center here: https:// one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-center In Student Center you may view your grades, unofficial transcript, class schedule, class permissions, financial aid, registration holds, and enrollment date/time. Additionally, you can use class search, shopping cart, drop classes, and swap classes to adjust your schedule during the self- service period. Some helpful tutorial videos on using functions of Student Center may be found here: https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/ student-center-videos A tutorial on how to enroll in courses using one.iu.edu may be found here: https://studentcentral.indiana.edu/ register/steps-register/index.html Advising Tools Doctoral students have course work prescribed for them by a faculty committee, chaired by the student's academic advisor. The student's advisor will direct the student to complete the prescribed courses in the proper order. For master's degree programs, the advisor and student follow a prescribed, faculty-approved curriculum. The advisor will direct the student's sequence of required course completion and elective choices according to the student's academic interests and professional goals. Master's degree students may view personalized, online, academic advisement reports (AARs) at https:// one.iu.edu/task/iu/degree-progress-report . These reports assist students in understanding which academic degree requirements have been completed, and which requirements have not. The degree requirements for each Master's and Doctoral degree program, as well as Graduate Certificates may be found here: https://bulletins.iu.edu/iub/phb/2022-2023/ graduate/index.shtml Financial Aid, Awards & Scholarships Assistantship Positions An assistantship is a paid appointment, awarded for one year to a qualified graduate student. This appointment requires the student to work part-time in one of the following types of positions: Associate Instructor: A graduate student who is employed as a teacher and engages in activities as a teacher. Teaching consists of the activities of teaching, lecturing, tutoring, instructing, laboratory assisting in an instructional role, and the like in the activity of imparting knowledge, providing the employee has responsibility for assigning grades for at least a portion of a course and has direct contact with students. Graduate Assistant: A graduate student who, in an academic department or in an administrative office, assists in work associated with the duties of faculty members or administrators, such as library searches, curricular development, or paper grading, and who is not an Associate Instructor, Research Assistant, Student Counselor, or Faculty Assistant. Research Assistant: A graduate student who is engaged in or assists with original, professional-level research. Applicants for admission to graduate degree programs and current students may apply for assistantships at publichealth.indiana.edu/student-portal/financial-support/ fellowships/index.html . Most assistantships are awarded in the spring semester of each academic year for use toward the following year's expenses. Financial support is not guaranteed with admission to a graduate program, but the School of Public Health\u2014Bloomington has an excellent record of supporting graduate students. In most cases, assistantships that are awarded to masters students are granted for only one year. Eligibility Any graduate student who is officially admitted to a master's or doctoral degree program in the School of Public Health-Bloomington is eligible to apply for an110 July 20, 2023 assistantship. However, a student whose first language is not English must pass the Test of English Proficiency for International Associate Instructor Candidates (TEPAIC) before being appointed as an associate instructor. For this reason, this type of assistantship is not normally granted to a student whose first language is not English, unless the student has passed the TEPAIC before the assistantship is awarded. The TEPAIC is not to be confused with the Indiana English Language Proficiency Examination (IEPE), which is required of all new School of Public Health-Bloomington students whose first language is not English. The IEPE is different from TEPAIC, in that the IEPE serves to test the readiness of such students to take Indiana University classes. The TEPAIC tests the ability of such students to teach as associate instructors. Criteria Criteria for selection are experience, departmental needs, scholarship records, and recommendations. Duties Students may be appointed as associate instructors, research assistants, or graduate assistants. Students are normally assigned to the department in which they are majoring. Duties may involve assisting faculty with teaching, research, or other departmental duties; teaching classes; or working in the Division of Campus Recreational Sports. Other special assignments may also be made. Stipend The stipend for the academic-year assistantships vary based on whether a student is a master's or doctoral student. Master student assistantships are for only one year. Fee Remission Limited or full fee remission may be awarded to any student enrolled in at least 6 credit hours per semester and working between 15 and 30 hours per week as a graduate student academic appointment. At departmental discretion, a fee remission may be awarded if a student is appointed to work for fewer than 15 hours per week. A fee remission may be awarded for a maximum of 30 credit hours per 12-month period, beginning with the start of the fall semester, with at most 12 credit hours in any semester or combined summer session. Fee remission does not cover dedicated fees, mandatory fees, and course-related fees or audit hours.

Learn more about Master's Degree Programs, Doctoral Degree Programs, or Graduate Certificates. Prior Learning With the exception of situations in which the School of Public Health-Bloomington is mandated to do by the state and university, the School of Public Health does not provide undergraduate or graduate credit for life experience/prior learning (experience outside the university for which no transferable credit from other institutions can be awarded). Admission to Candidacy When a doctoral student has completed all required course work and has passed the qualifying examination, the student's advisory committee nominates the student for doctoral degree candidacy. Following nomination to candidacy, the dissertation phase of the degree program begins. A doctoral student who has passed the qualifying examination, and who has earned acceptable grades in all courses on the student's doctoral course prescription, may initiate the Ph.D. degree candidacy process by completing and submitting the student's portion of the online Nomination to Candidacy for the Ph.D. DegreeJuly 20, 2023 111 Form at: one.iu.edu/task/iub/nomination-to-candidacy-for- phd.The structure of a student's Ph.D. degree program dictates which members of a student's advisory committee must approve this form. Double majors without a doctoral minor do not need to complete the sections of the form entitled, \"Minors\" and \"Minor Representative(s).\" However, in the section entitled \"Advisory Committee Members,\" double majors must list the advisory committee chair from each major. Single majors must list the advisory committee minor representative (or two, in the case of a student with two minors), in the \"Minor Representative(s)\" section of the form. Single majors must also list the chairperson of the advisory committee in the \"Advisory Committee Members\" section of the form. This form, when submitted by the student, routes to the School of Public Health-Bloomington dean's office, then to the advisory committee chairperson(s), then to the minor representative(s). Lastly, the form routes to the University Graduate School for final approval. NOTE: For students with prescribed courses older than seven years at the time of the qualifying exam, the School of Public Health graduate recorder must attach a document showing University Graduate School approval of the revalidation request for each such course. Approved doctoral degree candidates generally register for dissertation research credit hours only. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: I passed my qualifying examination with one incomplete course on my course prescription. May I be nominated to Ph.D. degree candidacy immediately? Answer: No, you must first earn an acceptable grade in the course which currently has an incomplete grade. Application for Commencement Ceremony Participation Ph.D. degrees are awarded monthly by the University Graduate School (UGS). Candidates for the Ph.D. degree who wish to participate in the graduation commencement ceremony, must complete and submit the Commencement Participation Application Form six (6) months before the expected date of graduation. The final deadline for this eDoc is February 25 for the Spring (May) ceremony, and September 25 for the Fall (December) ceremony. This is a strict UGS deadline, and the eDoc must be turned in no later than these dates in order for UGS to honor it. This eDoc is not a promise to the student to graduate during a certain month, but rather a way that UGS can track who intends to graduate so their name may be printed in the commencement program and read out loud at the commencement ceremony. The commencement ceremony is a celebratory event which happens twice per year. The May ceremony is for all students who will graduate between January and August. The December ceremony is for all students who will graduate between September and December. The application form is available at one.iu.edu/task/iub/ phd-commencement-participation-application Information about degree requirement completion is available at graduate.indiana.edu/academics-research/ graduation.shtml . Please note, this application is only for participation in the commencement ceremony, and is a separate process from degree conferral (actually graduating from the degree program and receiving the Ph.D. degree). Course Prescription Meeting Students must meet with their Doctoral Advisory Committee to determine the coursework the student will take prior to taking the Doctoral Qualifying Examination. Students should complete this step by the 8t week of their 2n semester of enrollment. During this meeting, the Advisory Committee will evaluate the students' transfer coursework, as well as list out coursework for the student to take prior to their taking the Qualifying Examination and becoming a Doctoral Candidate.

Course Prescription Stipulations: In addition to the requirements listed above, 1.A student registered in a doctoral program must satisfactorily complete all course work and the doctoral qualifying examination within five (5) years of the initial registration. 2.Courses used to satisfy the 90 required credit hours of graduate coursework may not have been completed more than seven (7) years before the date on which the student takes the doctoral qualifying examination. The advisory committee chair may recommend that a maximum of 30 credits of coursework taken prior to this timeline be revalidated. Please see this link for procedures on revalidating coursework: https:// bulletins.iu.edu/iub/phb/2023-2024/policies/doctoral/ revalidation.shtml 3.A maximum of 15 credit hours of independent study, readings, and research courses are allowed. 4.Independent study, readings, research, internship, or practicum courses taken at previously attended universities or colleges may not be transferred or used towards the course prescription. 5.Elective or minor course work must clearly support the development of research competency in the major field. 6.Deficiencies in coursework must be made up during the first year of enrollment. Course Prescription Requirements The courses required for a doctoral degree are individually prescribed for each student following approval of the members of the student's advisory committee. The student and the advisory committee work together to prescribe the required research skill courses, major courses, minor courses, elective courses, and the appropriate number of dissertation credits. This prescription of required courses may be finalized and approved during a formal course prescription meeting attended by the student and the members of the student's advisory committee. The result of this meeting is a completed Report of Course Prescription Meeting Form, signed by the committeeJuly 20, 2023 113 members. This form is available at https://one.iu.edu/ task/iub/current-sph-students . This form, complete with committee approval signatures, must be submitted to the School of Public Health- Bloomington records office (room 123) for evaluation. The recorder will obtain the approval signature of the executive associate dean and send copies of the approved course prescription to the student and to the chair of the advisory committee. The original Report of Course Prescription Form will reside in the student's academic file. The student will be required to complete the prescribed courses and pass a qualifying examination before becoming a candidate for the Ph.D. degree. Complete the following steps to arrange the course prescription meeting: 1.The student and the advisory committee agree on a date and time for the student's course prescription meeting. 2.At least one week in advance of the proposed meeting date, the student completes and submits the Application to Schedule a Course Prescription Meeting Form. The Application to Schedule a Course Prescription Meeting Form may be found at https://one.iu.edu/task/iub/current-sph-students . The completed form must be submitted to the SPH Records Office, room 123. 3.Confirmation of the meeting date, time, and location will be communicated to the student and the committee members via email. This official graduate student meeting should take place no later than the eighth week of classes in the student's second semester of enrollment. A doctoral student's course prescription consists of a minimum of ninety credits, including research skill, major area of study, minor area of study, elective, and dissertation credits. The distribution of credits in these areas is normally as follows: Research skill courses (minimum 9 credits) Major courses (minimum 30 credits) Minor courses (minimum 9 credits) Elective courses (0-28 credits) Dissertation credits (20-30 credits) The 90 credits for the Ph.D. degree also includes coursework that is considered to be prerequisite or required coursework. These requirements are described in the section of the bulletin entitled Major, Minor, and Dissertation Course Requirements . Frequently Asked Questions: Question: How will I know what courses to take to earn my Ph.D. degree? Answer: Your courses will be prescribed for you with the help of your advisory committee. A course prescription will be officially approved. You and your advisor will refer to this course prescription before you select courses in which to register for each term. Question: How does the course prescription become officially approved? Answer: You and your advisory committee list all the requirements on a Report of Course Prescription Form,and your advisory committee signs the form at an official course prescription meeting. Question: When does this happen? Answer: It should happen soon after you begin your doctoral study. It must happen by the end of the eighth week of classes in the student's second semester of enrollment. Doctoral Degrees Offered The School of Public Health-Bloomington is authorized to qualify candidates for the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in biostatistics, environmental health, epidemiology, health behavior, human performance, and leisure behavior. The Ph.D. degree is offered through the University Graduate School but is administered by the School of Public Health-Bloomington. This degree provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the field of interest and an intimate knowledge of research methodology. Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics: PhD in Epidemiology PhD in Biostatistics Department of Applied Health Science: PhD in Health Behavior PhD in Nutrition MPH in Behavioral Social and Community Health + PhD in Health Behavior MPH in Public Health Administration + PhD in Health Behavior Department of Environmental and Occupational Health: PhD in Environmental Health Department of Kinesiology: PhD in Human Performance with the following specialties: Biomechanics Exercise Physiology Motor Learning and Control Sport Management Department of Health and Wellness Design: PhD in Leisure Behavior Dissertation Each candidate must present a satisfactory dissertation in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the doctoral degree. The dissertation permits the candidate to demonstrate creative ability in identifying and treating a significant problem; to collect, analyze, and interpret meaningful data by appropriate research methods; to make valid generalizations based on the findings; and to present the study in acceptable written form. The dissertation should be designed and carried out so as to make a positive contribution to the knowledge base of the profession. Completion of a dissertation normally requires at least one year of concentrated effort.114 July 20, 2023 Dissertation Completion Within Seven Years After approval by the committee, the research is conducted under the supervision of the dissertation director. The acceptability of the completed dissertation is first passed by the chair and then by the doctoral committee at a formal meeting. The dissertation must be completed within seven years after the successful completion of the qualifying examinations. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the termination of candidacy and of the student's enrollment in the degree program. To be reinstated to candidacy, the student must (a) apply for reinstatement and (b) retake and pass the qualifying examination or its equivalent (defined by the doctoral research committee in advance). A recommendation for reinstatement to candidacy must come from the chair of the doctoral research committee and receive approval from the executive associate dean of the School of Public Health- Bloomington, and final approval from the dean of the University Graduate School. Progress toward dissertation completion will be a factor in granting permission to continue. Such reinstatement, if granted, will be valid for a period of time which is determined by the dean of the University Graduate School. After the completed dissertation has been approved by the chair, it will be formatted in accordance with established regulations. At least four weeks before the final examination, a copy of the completed dissertation must be presented to each committee member. The dissertation must include an acceptance page, a 350- word abstract, and a vita sheet. An additional 350- word abstract, an additional title page, and a one-page announcement of the dissertation defense must also be submitted to the chair. Dissertation Proposal A student's research committee must formally approve the student's research project before it begins. To earn official approval, the student must present a research proposal at a public proposal meeting, open to faculty and students in the university community. Dissertation proposal materials are submitted to the chair of the candidate's research committee within a sufficient time frame in advance of the proposal meeting to permit a thorough review. Materials include an introduction to the study, a review of literature, and a description of research procedures to be used. If the proposed research involves human subjects, animals, biohazards, or radiation, approval from the appropriate institutional review board (IRB) must be obtained prior to the beginning of data collection. Information on the use of human subjects in research may be found at: research.iu.edu/compliance/ human-subjects/index.html . The dissertation proposal meeting may take place before or after IRB clearance has been obtained. Complete the following steps to arrange the meeting: 1.The student and the research committee agree on a date and time for the student's proposal meeting. 2.Ten (10) business days in advance of the proposed meeting date, the student completes and submits the Application to Schedule a Doctoral DissertationProposal Meeting Form. This form is available at https://one.iu.edu/task/iub/current-sph-students . Confirmation of the meeting date, time, and location will be communicated to the student and the committee members via email by the Degree Administration staff member assigned to graduate student services. During the first portion of the meeting, the student formally presents the research proposal in an open forum. Committee members and visitors have the opportunity to ask questions. Visitors leave after the formal presentation. How the remaining time is used is determined by the student's research committee. Dissertation Research Committee Upon successful completion of the qualifying examination, and admission to candidacy for the doctoral degree, the responsibilities of the advisory committee have been discharged, and that committee is technically disbanded. A new committee\u2014the research committee\u2014must be appointed for the purpose of guiding the candidate's dissertation research. In many instances the members of the advisory committee become members of the research committee. However, the actual makeup of the research committee will be determined by the nature of the research to be pursued and the interests and qualifications of faculty. Stipulations of Research Committee membership: The Ph.D. research committee must have at least four (4) members who are current members of Graduate Faculty at Indiana University. All members must have Indiana University graduate faculty status. The committee chair (and when applicable, co- chair) must be endorsed to chair dissertation committees in the student's major department. At least one other member of the research committee must also be endorsed to chair graduate student committees. All dissertation research committees must include at least three (3) members from the student's major department, and one (1) member to represent the doctoral minor. Faculty members from universities outside of IU are permitted to serve on the research committee, but the composition of the committee must also have four (4) members from IU as stated above. The outside faculty member's current Curriculum Vitae (CV) must be attached to the Nomination of Research Committee eDoc. Information regarding the eligibility of faculty to serve on the dissertation research committee may be found on the University Graduate School's website at https://graduate.indiana.edu/faculty-staff/ membership.html . Students are eligible to defend their final dissertation defense no earlier than six (6) months after the approval of the Nomination of Research Committee eDoc.July 20, 2023 115 Nomination of Research Committee eDoc: Following official admission to candidacy, the doctoral candidate completes the Nomination of Research Committee eDoc with the University Graduate School (UGS) at https://one.iu.edu/task/iupui/phd-nomination-of- research-committee . A summary of the proposed dissertation (as a prospectus) must be attached to the eDoc prior to submitting it. IRB approval (if the research involves human or animal subjects) should be attached if it has already been obtained at the time of turning in this eDoc as well. Here is a link to IUB's Research Compliance information: https://research.iu.edu/compliance/ human- subjects/index.html It is the student's responsibility to ensure that their research is in compliance with IU's Research Compliance requirements, and research must not begin until compliance is verified by the IRB. Dissertation Submission and Publication After the final examination in defense of the dissertation has been passed and the dissertation has been approved, Ph.D. degree candidates must submit the dissertation online via ProQuest.

At least two (2) of the above members must be members of Indiana University Graduate Faculty. To see whether a faculty member is a member of IU Graduate Faculty, please visit this link to view the Graduate Faculty Roster: graduate.indiana.edu/faculty-staff/membership.htmlAn Appointment of Advisory Committee Form must be completed and submitted to the graduate recorder in the SPH Records Office with approval of the advisory committee members. The form is available at one.iu.edu/ task/iub/current-sph-students . The doctoral advisory committee will work with the student to prepare a Course Prescription for the program of studies. The Course Prescription must be approved by the advisory committee and the executive associate dean no later than the eighth week of the second semester of full- time enrollment. The advisory committee will be responsible for prescribing coursework and writing and evaluating qualifying examinations. Doctoral Degree Progress Sequence The chronological steps in the doctoral degree process are: Admission Formation of an advisory committee (first term) Prescription of course work (second term) Completion of course work Qualifying examination Admission to candidacy Formation of research committee Dissertation proposal meeting Completion of dissertation research Application to participate in IU Commencement (via UGS eDoc) Application to defend dissertation (via internal SPH form) Defense announcement (via UGS eDoc) Defense of dissertation Submission of final dissertation Graduation (degree conferral) Doctoral Qualifying Examination Procedures To become a candidate for the Ph.D. degree, and to proceed with the dissertation research project, students must pass a comprehensive qualifying examination and submit a Nomination to Candidacy Form and Memo of Understanding (MOU) to the graduate recorder in the School of Public Health-Bloomington records office, room 123. The form may be found at this link: one.iu.edu/task/ iub/current-sph-students The qualifying examination covers the fundamentals of the fields in which specialization has been elected. The content and format of both the written and oral components of the doctoral qualifying examination are determined by the members of the doctoral advisory committee. Information below includes a step-by-step description of procedures for the doctoral qualifying examination. The written component of the doctoral qualifying examination may be scheduled during dates agreed upon by the advisory committee and the student. The oral examination must be completed no later than 90 days after the start of the written examination. 116 July 20, 2023 [Important note: The date on which a student's Ph.D. degree is awarded must be at least eight months after the passing date of the qualifying examination.] Doctoral Qualifying Examination Procedures 1.Students who have been admitted to a Ph.D. degree program pending completion of a master's or equivalent degree are expected to have completed this degree before taking the qualifying examination. Students pursuing Ph.D. degrees in environmental health, epidemiology, health behavior, and leisure behavior must provide the assistant director of graduate degree administration with a transcript showing completion of this degree before the student may take the doctoral qualifying examination. 2.A student must submit the Application for Doctoral Qualifying Examination Form to the chair of the student's advisory committee so that the chair can submit it to graduate recorder in the School of Public Health-Bloomington Records Office at least thirty (30) calendar days before the beginning of the examination. The form is available online at one.iu.edu/task/iub/current-sph-students 3.The application must include the proposed dates of the written portion of the examination and a planned date for the oral portion of the examination. 4.The Memo of Understanding (MOU) must include the following: specific details of product(s) that make up the student's qualifying exam specific time frame of the examination (not to exceed 90 days), which includes: Start date Full first draft or Department written exam due date Faculty feedback due date Revision due date Oral exam date grading scale/scoring system that will be used Note: In exceptional circumstances, changes to dates may be granted but will require an amendment to the MOU signed by the student and committee chairperson; those beyond 90 days require approval and signature of Executive Associate Dean. 5.The School of Public Health-Bloomington graduate recorder determines eligibility of the applicant to sit for the examination. To sit for the examination, a student must have completed the required research skill courses, and be within one course of completing the 90 credit (major, minor, and elective) portion of the course prescription. If a student passes the qualifying examination with one outstanding incomplete course, this course must be completed before submission of the Nomination to Candidacy Form. All 90 course prescription credits must be no older than 7 years on the date of the qualifying examination. Any course on the course prescription, which is older than 7 years on this date must receive revalidation approvalbefore a student will be able to sit for the qualifying examination. 6.Each member of the advisory committee is informed by e-mail by the graduate recorder of the scheduled oral examination once a room is scheduled. 7.The chair of the advisory committee works with all committee members to prepare the content of the written components of the exam. 8.If the written portion of the exam contains activities that are taken in a proctored format, the chair is responsible for securing the space for such activities and ensuring that an appropriate proctor has been identified. 9.The chair of the advisory committee ensures that the student is provided with details as to the criteria by which the written exam will be evaluated. 10.The chair of the advisory committee provides the exam to the student and submits a copy via email to the School of Public Health-Bloomington Dean's Office. 11.The written portion of the qualifying examination takes place. 12.The student submits the written portion of the examination to the chair of the advisory committee, who subsequently forwards the responses to the committee members by e-mail, with a copy to the School of Public Health-Bloomington Dean's Office. 13.Subsequent to receiving the responses to the written portion of the examination, the advisory committee may choose to request revisions that must be completed prior to the scheduled oral portion of the examination. 14.The oral portion of the qualifying examination must take place within 90 days following the date that the written examination is initially started by the student. Permission to exceed 90 days between the start of the written and oral portions of the examination must be obtained from the associate dean for research and graduate studies. 15.If a student passes the qualifying examination, a notification will be sent by the graduate recorder to the student with instructions for the student to visit a link to the University Graduate School's Nomination to Candidacy approval workflow, and initiate the approval process. 16.In the event of a failure of the qualifying examination, a letter will be sent, notifying the student of the failure and the opportunity for one more attempt to pass the examination. 17.In the event of a failure on the first attempt, the student and committee will reinitiate the process for the doctoral qualifying examination as described beginning with item #2 above. 18.In the event of a second failure, the student will be notified of formal dismissal from the doctoral program. No future registrations will be permitted through the School of Public Health-Bloomington. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: If I have completed my research tool skills, and all the courses on my course prescription, but I have two courses which have incomplete grades, can I take the qualifying examination?July 20, 2023 117 Answer: No, you must only have one course in which an appropriate grade is not yet posted. Question: A few of my old courses were revalidated. It took me longer than expected to prepare for my quals. During the extra time it took me to finish my prescribed courses, another course on my course prescription became more than 7 years old. Will this be a problem? Answer: If you have already revalidated 30 credits of old courses, you may not request revalidation for another course. However, if you have not yet revalidated 30 credits, this problem is not insurmountable. If you have maintained currency of knowledge in the subject matter of the additional old course, you may ask your committee chair to add a request to revalidate that course to the document containing the other course-revalidation requests. If you have not remained current in the subject matter of that course, then you and your advisor must seek a different solution. The worst-case scenario would require you to complete more course work before sitting for the qualifying exam. Question: My minor representative does not wish to be involved in the qualifying examination. Is this OK? Answer: Yes, The minor advisor may, -but does not have to-participate in the written examination. The same is true for attending the oral qualifying examination. Question: If my minor advisor participates in the written portion of my qualifying exam, does my minor advisor have to attend my oral qualifying examination? Answer: No, it is still optional for the minor advisor. Question: Are School of Public Health-Bloomington Ph.D. students required to be registered in the semester or summer session during which the qualifying examination is taken? Answer: The School of Public Health-Bloomington does not require that Ph.D. students be enrolled in the semester or summer session during which the qualification examination is taken. However, there are various reasons why a student may need to be registered, including assistantship awards, scholarships, insurance, compliance with SEVIS (for international students only), etc. Students should evaluate their individual situation and contact the appropriate source(s) to determine if enrollment is required. Question: Can I apply to take the qualifying examination if I currently do not meet the eligibility criteria, but I will by the time the test is administered? Answer: Yes, you may apply to take the qualifying exam even though you do not meet the criteria, as long as you will have met the criteria when the exam is administered. In such a case, you must inform the assistant director of graduate degree administration of this situation when you submit the application (so it will be noted on the application). If the criteria are not met by the exam date, the student will not be allowed to take the exam. Enrollment after the Qualifying Examination and Off-Campus Enrollment After passing the qualifying examinations, a doctoral student must enroll each semester for dissertation orresearch credit at the regular fee until graduation. If the required number of dissertation credits is reached before the dissertation is completed, the candidate must continue to enroll for dissertation or research credits or SPH-G 901 (a 6-credit hour course with a flat fee). Enrollment during summer sessions is not required unless the degree is to be awarded during a summer session. Candidates must be enrolled during the semester (including summer) during which the degree is awarded. Notes about SPH-G 901: Permission is required to enroll in G901 during the summer and will only be considered for students who will be graduating during the summer. Registration in SPH-G 901 is restricted to six semesters. Off-Campus Enrollment Doctoral candidates who are off campus and wish to enroll must contact the graduate recorder in the School of Public Health-Bloomington records office, room 123, for registration authorization. Students will be billed by the bursar for the appropriate tuition and fees. Final Dissertation Defense The student defends the dissertation in a meeting with the student's research committee. It is a public meeting, open to students and faculty. The student should confer with the research committee chair regarding expectations. The dissertation defense may not take place less than six months following University Graduate School approval of the candidate's Nomination of Research Committee for the Ph.D. Degree Form. Complete the following steps in preparation for the dissertation defense meeting: 1.Select a meeting date and time. - The doctoral candidate and the research committee agree on a date and time for the student's dissertation defense meeting. 2.Student completes and submits an SPH Dissertation Defense Eligibility Verification Form. - The form is available at https://one.iu.edu/ task/iub/current-sph-students . This form must be submitted a minimum of forty (40) calendar days in advance of the proposed defense meeting date. 3.Student receives an email message. - After Degree Administration staff verifies the student's eligibility and a meeting room has been booked (for in-person defenses), the student will receive an email message confirming the meeting date, time, and location. The email message will also include detailed instructions for submitting the PhD Defense Announcement eDoc, found within the University Graduate School Task Center, located at https:// one.iu.edu/collection/iub/university-graduate-school . 4.Student completes the PhD Defense Announcement eDoc with the University Graduate School. - At least 35 days in advance of the proposed meeting date, the student must initiate a request to post an announcement of the defense meeting. The form (\"PhD Defense Announcement) may be found within the University Graduate School Task Center, located at this link: https://one.iu.edu/collection/ iub/university-graduate-school . The student must118 July 20, 2023 complete, save, and submit this eDoc. A successfully submitted eDoc will route to the School of Public Health - Bloomington recorder, the student's research committee chair, and finally to the University Graduate School for final approval. 5. University Graduate School approves the request to post the defense announcement. - Step four must be completed, resulting in the form routing to the University Graduate School at least thirty days in advance of the proposed meeting date, or the request will be denied. If the request is denied, a new request form would have to be completed and submitted by the student. Following University Graduate School approval of the PhD Defense Announcement eDoc, an announcement of the student's dissertation defense meeting will be posted on the website of the University Graduate School. 6. Student submits a draft of the dissertation to the research committee. - At least four weeks before the defense meeting date, the student must submit a draft of the dissertation to the committee to examine before the final defense meeting takes place. The time frames for submission of the defense meeting request and announcement are enforced to ensure that the defense announcement is posted well in advance of the defense meeting date. This is a University Graduate School requirement. Failure to meet these deadlines will delay the scheduling of the final defense meeting. Following the defense meeting, the research committee chair will report the outcome to the School of Public Health-Bloomington recorder. The chair will also assign a letter grade to the dissertation credits on the student's transcript. Human and Animal Subjects Indiana University requires that all research using human subjects be approved before the research begins. This requirement ensures protection of the rights and welfare of persons used in research. It also satisfies a number of federal, state, and institutional regulations. If a research project involves human subjects, no data may be collected until documentation of clearance for the use of human subjects has been obtained. No thesis or dissertation will be accepted for which such clearance has not been obtained. Forms and procedures for this purpose are available at research.iu.edu/compliance/human-subjects/ index.html . If human subjects are to be used in research, an approved clearance form for the use of human subjects must be obtained and submitted as part of the process of nomination of the students research committee members. The research proposal meeting may take place either before or after human subjects clearance has been obtained. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: My research project will involve a collection of data from human or animal subjects. How do I obtain approval for my project? Answer: Visit research.iu.edu/compliance/human-subjects/ index.html and follow the directions to obtain approval for your use of human subjects.Doctoral Students Doctoral Degrees Offered Doctoral Degree Progress Sequence Prerequisites Doctoral Advisory Committee Transfer of Credit Revalidation of Courses Course Prescription Requirements Course Prescription Meeting Doctoral Qualifying Examination Procedures Enrollment after the Qualifying Examination and Off- Campus Enrollment Admission to Candidacy Formation of Dissertation Research Committee Nomination of Research Committee approval by UGS (submit NORC eDoc via UGS) Dissertation Proposal Meeting with Research Committee IRB Approval (Human and Animal Subjects) Begin Dissertation Research Dissertation Completion Within Seven Years Application for Graduation Final Dissertation Defense Dissertation Submission and Publication Prerequisites Although most applicants for the Ph.D. have backgrounds in appropriately related fields, the possession of degrees in these fields is not a prerequisite to admission. However, applicants with deficiencies in their academic background will be required to take specific courses as prerequisites (or co-requisites) to degree course work. Deficiencies in academic background will be evaluated by the doctoral advisory committee and remedial course work prescribed. In general, such remedial work cannot be counted toward the credit hours required for the degree. The following Ph.D. majors require that a prospective applicant hold both a bachelor's and master's degree: Epidemiology Environmental Health Health Behavior Leisure Behavior Nutrition The follow Ph.D. majors require that a prospective applicant hold a bachelor's degree: Biostatistics Human Performance Revalidation of Courses Normally, a course may not be counted toward degree requirements if it has been completed more than seven (7) years prior to the passing of the qualifying examination for Ph.D. students The doctoral advisory committee, may, however, recommend to the executive associate dean that coursework taken prior to the above deadline be revalidated, if it can be demonstrated that the knowledgeJuly 20, 2023 119 contained in the course(s) remains current. Currency of knowledge may be demonstrated by such things as: Passing an examination specifically on the material covered by the course Passing a more advanced course in the same subject area Passing a comprehensive examination in which the student demonstrates substantial knowledge of the content of the course; if the qualifying examination is used for the purpose of revalidation, the number of courses to be revalidated by this method should be limited to two (2) to avoid compromising the integrity of the qualifying examination process. Teaching a comparable course Publishing scholarly research demonstrating substantial knowledge of the content and fundamental principles of the course Documented professional experience Procedure for revalidation of courses: Course revalidation is approved via the student's advisory committee chair, SPH-B assistant dean of graduate studies, and the University Graduate School via the \"Request for Revalidation of Coursework\" eDoc: https://one.iu.edu/task/iupui/ request-for-revalidation-of-coursework Each course being considered for revalidation should be justified separately, even if the same revalidation method is being used to explain currency of knowledge in multiple courses. Students must provide a specific and detailed explanation in each \"Means of Revalidation\" box in the eDoc, as to how each revalidation method has kept them current in the knowledge of the specific course being addressed. Failure to provide a specific and detailed explanation may lead to disapproval of this form. Students who cite professional experience or publications as a revalidation method must attach an up-to-date Curriculum Vitae (CV) in the \"Documentation\" section of the eDoc. It is not necessary to attach each individual published paper as they should be listed in the student's CV. Transfer of Credit With the approval of a doctoral student's advisory committee chair and the assistant dean of graduate studies, graduate-level academic credit from another institution may be transferred for use in a School of Public Health-Bloomington doctoral degree. An official transcript from the registrar's office of the academic institution where the course work was completed must be on file in the School of Public Health- Bloomington records office. A copy of this transcript should accompany the request through its approval stages. It must be an official transcript, meaning it's sent directly from the issuing institution to the School of Public Health admissions team or graduate records administrator. The form to begin this process is located at https:// one.iu.edu/task/iub/current-sph-students : press \"Start,\" and select the \"Forms\" link.Stipulations for transferability are as follows: A maximum 30 credits of transferred graduate-level coursework obtained either at a previously attended institution (or obtained via a completed Master's degree obtained at an Indiana University campus), may be counted towards the PhD Degree. Allowance of transfer credits used towards the PhD degree are subject to approval from the doctoral advisory committee and the assistant dean of graduate studies. Courses which counted towards the requirements of any type of doctoral or terminal degree (for example a DVM, MD, JD, PhD, D.Phil, Ed.D, or any other type doctoral degree) are completely ineligible for transfer, and are not allowable for use towards the PhD degree. This is a University Graduate School policy and there are no exceptions for this stipulation. A student could theoretically transfer coursework from another institution which was taken under a doctoral degree program, but only if that doctoral degree was never completed or certified, and never will be. For Ph.D. degrees, coursework completed more than seven (7) years before successful completion of the qualifying examination must be revalidated via the Course Revalidation procedure in order to be approved and transferred. Authorization of revalidation methods are subject to approval by the SPH-B assistant dean of graduate studies, and the University Graduate School. Please see the SPH- B Academic Bulletin section on Course Revalidation methods and procedures for specific details. A minimum grade of B is required in each course to be transferred. A course with a grade of B-minus may not be transferred for use in any graduate degree. Grades of Pass (P) or Satisfactory (S) cannot be accepted unless there is official documentation from the transferring institution to verify that these grades are equivalent to at least a B on a graduate grading scale. It is the student's responsibility to obtain the required verification from an appropriate source, such as the professor of the course, the Registrar's Office of the institution where the course was completed, or an administrator of the institution. The verification must be on official university letterhead and come directly from a university official. No credit can be transferred for a course that cannot be officially documented as carrying graduate-level credit. The cumulative grade point average (GPA) for students in the School of Public Health-Bloomington is calculated using only Indiana University graded course work. Credits and grades in work transferred from other institutions are not used in the calculation of a student's Indiana University GPA. Nomination of Doctoral Research Committee Approval by UGS Nomination of Doctoral Research Committee Approval by UGS (via submission of NORC eDoc via UGS to120 July 20, 2023 be initiated by student after formation of Research Committee): When the student has formed their Research Committee, they shall submit a Nomination of Research Committe e (NORC) eDoc, found at this link: one.iu.edu/task/iub/phd- nomination-of-research-committee . A summary of the proposed dissertation (as a prospectus) must be attached to the eDoc prior to submitting it. IRB approval (if the research involves human or animal subjects), if already obtained, may also be attached to the eDoc. IU Bloomington Research Compliance information is available at research.iu.edu/ compliance/human- subjects/index.html . It is the student's responsibility to ensure that their research is in compliance with IU's Research Compliance requirements, and research must not begin until compliance is verified by the IRB. The student will become eligible to defend their dissertation six (6) months after the approval of the Nomination of Research Committee eDoc. If a change in the committee membership should become necessary after the approval of the NORC eDoc, the student shall submit a Ph.D. Research Committee Change eDoc, found at one.iu.edu/task/ iub/phd-research-committee-change . The membership change approval does not reset the six (6) month clock on when a student may defend following NORC approval. Students must maintain the minimum of four (4) IU graduate faculty members, with two members having endorsed status, if they make changes to their research committee. Graduate Non-degree Enrollment The School of Public Health-Bloomington welcomes non-degree graduate students to select and complete courses related to their academic fields of interest. The faculty does, however, reserve the right to limit enrollment in courses, required for our degrees, to students who have been admitted to those programs. Furthermore, no more than 9 credits, taken as a non-degree graduate student, before formal admission to a School of Public Health-Bloomington graduate-level program, may be used to satisfy requirements for a School of Public Health-Bloomington graduate-level degree. Non-degree graduate students who intend to earn a School of Public Health-Bloomington graduate-level degree are strongly encouraged to meet with a designated faculty advisor for the desired degree program. This faculty member should be from the department in which the selected course resides. For additional information about application deadlines and requirements for graduate non-degree students, please email sphgrad@iu.edu . Academic Integrity Indiana University may discipline a student for academic misconduct, which is defined as any activity which tends to undermine the academic integrity of the institution.Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, interference, violation of course rules, facilitating academic dishonesty. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: What happens if I get caught cheating? Answer: If you are caught cheating, your course instructor is obligated to report the incident to the Dean of Students. Academic sanctions vary according to the type of offense. Question: Will I be penalized if I assist a cheater? Answer: Yes. Participation in the incident constitutes academic dishonesty. Question: How do I avoid plagiarism? Answer: Many composition assignments require students to use reference materials written by others. It is important, when using references to avoid copying text unless you attribute it to the author with a footnote. Instructors commonly use turnitin.com to check student submissions for plagiarism. Students may use this service to check their text prior to submission. Advising and Registration Each student will be assigned an academic advisor. The program of each candidate must be planned cooperatively by the student and the advisor, taking into account the student's educational background and objectives. All phases of the student's program are subject to the approval of the advisor. All graduate students are required to meet with their advisor before registering for classes each term. During each of these meetings, a student and advisor identify the courses in which the student will enroll for the following term. The resulting semester schedule is recorded by the advisor either in the student information system's AdRx advising contacts system, or on a paper Academic Advisor Registration Approval Form, and signed by the advisor. If the advising record is saved online, the advisor will contact the School of Public Health-Bloomington Records Office and the student will be given clearance to register. If the paper form is utilized, the student must submit the signed form to the Records Office in SPH 123 to receive clearance to register. Paper copies of the Advisor Registration Approval Form may be picked up in SPH 123, or the form may be downloaded at one.iu.edu/task/iub/current-sph-students . (Additional registration information is available in the Enrollment and Student Academic Information Bulletin.) Advising Tools Doctoral students have course work prescribed for them by a faculty committee, chaired by the student's academic advisor. The student's advisor will direct the student to complete the prescribed courses in the proper order. For master's degree programs, the advisor and student follow a prescribed, faculty-approved curriculum. The advisor will direct the student's sequence of required course completion and elective choices according the student's academic interests and professional goals. Master's degree students may view personalized, online, academic advisement reports (AARs) at one.iu.edu/task/ iu/degree-progress-report . These reports assist students in understanding which academic degree requirements have been completed, and which requirements have not. The requirements for each master's degree program are listed on an individual Course Requirement Summary,July 20, 2023 121 available at one.iu.edu/task/iub/current-sph-students . The Course Requirement Summary for each academic program specifies requirements including total credit hours needed for completion of the degree, courses to be taken, GPA requirements, and suggested electives. The Course Requirement Summary is used by students and their academic advisors to guide the selection of courses and monitor progress. Adhering to the requirements specified on the Course Requirement Summary is the student's responsibility. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: How will I know what classes I need to take to complete my degree? Answer: We provide many tools that help students understand their degree requirements, including this online bulletin. Online academic advising reports exist for master's students. Master's degree program tab sheets summarize master's degree requirements in a an easy-to- read format. Doctoral students have their required courses prescribed for them on an approved course prescription form. Academic requirements are thoroughly disclosed in the school academic bulletin. In addition, we provide each graduate student with an academic advisor to guide the student along the path to a degree. Question: If I know which classes I need to complete my degree, do I still need an academic advisor's approval to register? Answer: Yes. It is important that your academic advisor approves your class schedule for each term. Academic advisors are familiar with proper course sequencing and course availability schedules. While you are responsible for completing the requirements for your degree, we guide you in the right direction, and help you avoid errors which could unnecessarily cost you time and effort. Graduation: Degree Application All students must complete and submit an application to graduate. Applications to graduate must be submitted at least six months before the desired graduation date. Failure to submit an application at least six months early may delay graduation and prevent the student's name from being entered in the graduation ceremony program. Master's degree students receive their degrees from the School of Public Health-Bloomington, and must therefore apply for graduation at sph.indiana.edu/forms/student/ graduation-application/application.html . Ph.D. degree students receive their degrees from the University Graduate School, and must therefore visit graduate.indiana.edu/academics-research/ graduation.shtml , and scroll down to the section \"Ph.D. Students\" to view instructions regarding completion steps for the degree, including the application to participate in the Commencement Ceremony. Master's degrees are conferred in May, June, July, and December. Ph.D. degrees are conferred every month. Graduation commencement ceremonies take place in May and December. Students graduating between January and August may attend the May ceremony. Students graduating between September and December may attend the December ceremony. Frequently Asked Questions:Question: How do I make sure my name will appear in the University's graduation commencement program? Answer: To make sure your name appears in the University's graduation commencement program, you should complete and submit the application for graduation at least six months before your desired graduation date. The university creates the program for each graduation commencement ceremony. For the May graduation commencement program, February 25 is the last day on which a student's name may be added to the commencement program. For the December graduation commencement program, May 1 is the last day on which a student's name may be added to the commencement program. Question: I am a graduate student planning to complete the requirements for my degree in the near future, but not planning to attend the graduation commencement ceremony. Do I still need to apply to graduate? Answer: Yes. All graduate degree-seeking students must apply for graduation, whether or not they plan to attend the university's Commencement ceremony. The graduation application is the only means of letting the graduate recorder know the student plans to complete the degree. This cues the recorder to audit a student's progress toward satisfaction of all degree requirements for a specific degree certification date. If you do not tell the recorder when you want to graduate, nothing happens. Course Load Requirements for Employment, SEVIS, and Full-Time Study SEVIS The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has created the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to maintain current information on nonimmigrant students, exchange visitors, and their dependents (i.e., all those with F or J visa status). Students monitored by SEVIS must maintain full-time enrollment during fall and spring semesters (at least 8 credits for graduate students, or 6 credits for graduate students with associate instructorships or graduate assistantships). For more information about SEVIS, please visit ois.iu.edu/visas/student-visas/index.html . Employment Persons who are employed full time should carry only 5 to 6 credit hours of graduate course work per semester. Those employed half time should not take more than 9 credit hours. The maximum credit load for associate instructors, research assistants, and graduate assistants depends on the number of credit hours indicated in the work assignment notice sent at the time of the appointment. Full-Time Study Graduate students are considered to be enrolled full- time with a minimum of 8 credits. Graduate students with an assistantship are considered to be enrolled full-time with a minimum of 6 credits. To have an assistantship, graduate students must be enrolled in a minimum of 6 credits. Individual student loan sources must be contacted to determine the minimum number and type of credits in which students must be enrolled to defer student loan repayment. Frequently asked Question:122 July 20, 2023 Question: I only have one 3-credit class to complete next semester for my degree, but I have an assistantship and I want to keep that job. Do I have to enroll in extra credits that I don't need just to be able to keep my assistantship? Answer: Yes, unless the Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA) will agree to accept a letter, explaining your situation. If the OSFA accepts a letter of explanation, it is possible that they may waive this requirement and allow you to keep your assistantship with fewer than six credits of enrollment. The letter of explanation must come from the School of Public Health-Bloomington Dean's Office. The administrative secretary for academic affairs usually produces such letters. Exceptions to Academic Policies and Requirements An exception to an academic requirement or policy may be approved by the executive associate dean for a School of Public Health-Bloomington graduate student. Exceptions are only considered under very unusual circumstances, which are not under the student's control. The Course Substitution Request Form is available at one.iu.edu/task/iub/current-sph-students . The student's academic advisor must complete and sign the form, which is submitted to the School of Public Health-Bloomington graduate recorder in SPH 123. A request for an exception or waiver for a non-course requirement or academic policy must come in the form of a memo addressed to the executive associate dean. The memo must be sent by the student's academic advisor. This memo should be sent by email or campus mail to the School of Public Health-Bloomington graduate recorder in SPH 123. The chair of a doctoral student's advisory committee may request course substitutions for up to nine credits of courses required on the student's course prescription form. The Course Substitution Request Form may be used for this purpose. If the number of requested, credits to be substituted exceeds nine credits, the full advisory committee must provide approval signatures on a form requesting substituted credits in excess of nine. The form for this purpose is entitled, Amendment to Doctoral Course Prescription Request Form. This form is also online at one.iu.edu/task/iub/current-sph-students . Frequently Asked Questions: Question: If I have already completed a course which is equivalent to a required course, can I substitute that course for the required course? Answer: Yes, as long as your academic advisor agrees that the course to be substituted satisfies the requirement. In such a case, complete the online substitution form and have your advisor sign it. Then deliver it the School of Public Health-Bloomington graduate recorder in SPH 123. Question: If I have secured a position at another institution, can exceptions to timelines and deadlines be considered? Answer: The student's academic advisor should send an email message to the graduate recorder. The message should explain the situation and specifically request the exception. It should be noted that exceptions will only be considered if the circumstances interfering with adherence to the policy are beyond the student's control.Question: I have everything ready for my graduate student meeting (course prescription/proposal/defense). I do not understand why I have to wait a few weeks to have my meeting. Can I have it sooner? Answer: No. The advance notice is required for several reasons. Students must become aware of the required lead time for each kind of meeting and request meetings accordingly. Graduate-Level Credit Only credit in graduate-level courses may be applied toward completion of a graduate academic program in the School of Public Health-Bloomington. Credit earned in courses below the 500 level may not be used in such programs with the following exception: A graduate-level course with a course number below 500, which is transferred from another institution of higher learning, may count for credit in School of Public Health-Bloomington graduate programs if the official transcript from the institution offering the course identifies the course as a graduate-level course. Credit for SLST-S 501 and other SLST credit used for English language improvement may not count toward completion of any academic program in the School of Public Health-Bloomington. Graduate Student Research and Human Subjects Indiana University requires that all research using human subjects be approved before the research begins. This requirement satisfies a number of federal, state, and institutional regulations, and more importantly\u2014ensures protection of the rights and welfare of persons used in research. Every research proposal submitted by a student and/or faculty member must contain documentation that clearance has been obtained for the use of human subjects. No thesis or dissertation will be accepted for which such clearance has not been obtained. Forms and procedures for this purpose are available online at research.iu.edu/compliance/human-subjects/index.html . Grade Appeal The following procedures exist for a student who believes that a grade earned in a School of Public Health- Bloomington course is unfair: The student must first attempt to resolve the dispute with the course instructor of record. If a resolution cannot be reached between the student and instructor, the student then must complete and submit a formal appeal to the department which offers the course, using the Grade Appeal Application Form. The Grade Appeal Application Form may be found at: one.iu.edu/task/ iub/current-sph-students . In addition, all supporting documentation must be included with the form. This packet must be submitted to the departmental office, addressed to the authority who deals with departmental grade appeals. The departmental addresses and grade-appeal authority in each department are as follows: Applied Health Science (PH 116) - Assistant ChairJuly 20, 2023 123 Environmental Health (PH C033)- Director of Undergraduate Education Epidemiology and Biostatistics (PH C036) - Assistant Chair Kinesiology (PH 112) - Director of Undergraduate Education Health & Wellness Design (PH 133) - Associate Chair for Instruction and Undergraduate Studies The formal complaint will be considered by the departmental authority within fourteen (14) working days, during which time departmental authority may request additional information from both the student and instructor. The departmental authority will serve as a mediator between the student and instructor. If the issue is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, the student may appeal the outcome to the School of Public Health Academic Fairness Committee. This request is to be made in writing and submitted to the Office of the Executive Associate Dean of the School of Public Health (PH 111), addressed to the Academic Fairness Committee. The Academic Fairness Committee will study the documentation and conduct a hearing on the case within fourteen (14) days, at which both the student and instructor will be present. The decision of the committee will be the determination of the case at the school level. Appeals of grades should be made as soon as possible after the end of the semester. Requests for consideration of an appeal must occur within one calendar year from the end of the term in which the course was taken. Requests after this time limit will not be considered. Grade of Incomplete A grade of I (Incomplete) is given only when the work of the course is substantially completed and when the student's work is of passing quality. The student's instructor determines the requirements and time frame for completion of the course. The maximum time allowed by the university for completion of the course is one year from the date on which the grade of I was recorded. Only upon appeal to the executive associate dean is an extension of an incomplete possible. If the student fails to remove the incomplete within the time allowed, the Office of the Registrar will change the grade from an I to an F. Students should not register for a course in which they have a previous grade of I. Instead the student must work with the original course instructor to complete the work, at which time the instructor changes the grade of I to the grade the student earns. Once a student has graduated, an incomplete may remain on the official record. These regulations do not apply to research and reading courses in which completion of the course work is not necessarily required at the end of the semester. Incomplete work in these courses will be denoted by a grade of R (deferred grade). A grade of R (Deferred) indicates that the nature of the course is such that thework of the student can be evaluated only after two or more terms. Grades and Academic Standing Grades Quality points are assigned for purposes of determining the cumulative grade point average (GPA) as follows: A+ or A = 4 credit points; A- = 3.7; B+ = 3.3; B = = = = = 1.3; D = 1.0; D- = 0.7; F = 0. No points are assigned for grades of I (Incomplete), S (Satisfactory), P (Pass), or W (Withdrawal). Minimum Required Grades Courses with grades below C do not count toward degree requirements for doctoral degrees or master's degrees. However, all grades earned in courses taken for graduate credit are included in the calculation of the grade point average. Course Repeat In the event that a student earns a course grade that does not satisfy degree program requirements, the student shall be permitted to repeat the course. All course attempts will be counted towards the student's GPA. There may be cases in which the faculty advisor determines that a course should not repeated (such as student-faculty conflict); such cases will be managed on an individual basis. Academic Standing All graduate students are expected to maintain an overall GPA of at least 3.0. Students whose averages fall below this level will be placed on probation. Master's degree students who have failed to achieve a GPA of at least 3.0 by the time the credit hour requirements for the degree have been completed will be denied further enrollment. Doctoral students who lack the required minimum average will not be permitted to take the qualifying examinations.

The faculty-directors of the Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) degree program in the School of Public Health-Bloomington have entered into joint degree agreements with the faculty directors of four degree programs in other schools. The four resulting joint degree programs are described as follows: (M.P.H.) / Juris Doctor degree (J.D.) The faculty of the Maurer School of Law has agreed to reduce the minimum total number of credits required for the Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from 88 to 79 for a student who has earned an M.P.H. degree from the School of Public Health-Bloomington in any of the five available majors. (M.P.H.) in Behavioral, Social, and Community Health / Master of Arts degree (M.A.) in African Studies The faculty directors of both degree programs agreed to allow sharing of electives, which reduces the total number of credits required to earn both degrees. For information about specific requirements for this joint degree program, please contact the faculty advisors for each program. (M.P.H.) in Behavioral, Social, and Community Health / Master of Arts degree (M.A.) in Latin American and Caribbean Studies The faculty directors of both degree programs agreed to allow sharing of electives, which reduces the total number of credits required to earn both degrees. For information about specific requirements for this joint degree program, please contact the faculty advisors for each program. (M.P.H.) in Behavioral, Social, and Community Health / Master of Arts degree (M.A.) in Russian and East European Studies The faculty directors of both degree programs agreed to allow sharing of electives, which reduces the total number of credits required to earn both degrees. For information about specific requirements for this joint degree program, please contact the faculty advisors for each program. Pass/Fail Option Coursework that is prerequisite to a degree program or that is to be counted toward the total credits required for a graduate-level degree may not be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. With the written consent of the student's advisor and the executive associate dean, permission may be given to take other coursework under this option. Required Graduate Student Meetings The graduate student is expected to meet regularly with advisory and/or research committees for academic and research advising. In addition to these informal meetings, the following official meetings are required for each of the graduate degrees: Master's thesis option students: Proposal meeting Thesis defense Doctoral students: Course prescription meeting Qualifying examinationProposal meeting Dissertation defense The proposal meeting and the thesis/dissertation defense are public meetings, open to the academic community. Those attending these meetings are expected to follow the established protocol. The proposal meeting is open to faculty and students in the university community. During the first portion, the student formally presents the research proposal in an open forum. Committee members and visitors have the opportunity to ask questions. Visitors leave after the formal presentation. The remaining time is determined by the student's research committee. Students may schedule the meetings described above by completing and submitting the appropriate form to request the desired meeting. Forms to request these meetings are available at https://one.iu.edu/task/iub/current-sph- students. Students must carefully follow the directions on these forms. Paper copies of these forms are available in SPH 123. Residence Requirement Residence Requirement Students in the Ph.D. degree program must spend two consecutive semesters during one academic year in- person on the Bloomington campus, taking a full-time load of course work. Full-time enrollment is 8 credit hours per semester for graduate students who are not full-time graduate assistants, research assistants, and associate instructors. For full-time graduate assistants, research assistants, and associate instructors, 6 credit hours constitute a full-time course load. A period of full-time residence is not required for students in master's degree programs. However, master's degree students must take a minimum of 25-30 of the required 35-47 credit hours at Indiana University. Work Done at More Than One Indiana University Campus Students who plan to earn a degree through a degree- granting unit on one Indiana University campus and who plan to take a substantial number of hours on one or more of the other Indiana University campuses in partial fulfillment of degree requirements should have their programs of study approved in advance by the degree- granting unit. The residency requirement must be met on the campus where the degree-granting unit is located. Restrictions on Indpendent Study Students whose cumulative GPA is lower than 3.0 are not permitted to register for the following independent study research and readings courses, internships and practicums: Applied Master's Degree Course Revalidation Course work completed more than seven years before the starting date of student's master's degree program-entry semester may not be used to satisfy the program's course requirements unless the student has remained current in the course subject matter. The student's graduate advisor may recommend to the executive associate dean that course work taken before the seven year time limit be revalidated if it can be demonstrated that the knowledge contained in the course(s) remains current. Currency of knowledge may be demonstrated by such accomplishments as: (a) passing an examination specifically on the material covered by the course; (b) passing a more advanced course in the same subject area; (c) passing a comprehensive examination in which the student demonstrates substantial knowledge of the content of the course; (d) teaching a comparable course; (e) publishing scholarly research demonstrating fundamental principles of the course; or (f) demonstrating currency of course subject matter through work experience within seven years of matriculation. Each course for which consideration for revalidation is being requested should be justified separately in a document presented to the executive associate dean for approval. Ph.D. Degree Course Revalidation For Ph.D. degrees, course work completed more than seven years before successful completion of the qualifying examination is not applicable to the program unless the student has remained current in the course subject matter. The graduate advisor, after consultation with the advisory committee, may recommend to the executive associate dean that a maximum of 30 credit hours of course work taken before the seven-year time limit be revalidated if it can be demonstrated that the knowledge contained in the course(s) remains current. Currency of knowledge may be demonstrated by such accomplishments as (a) passing an examination specifically on the material covered by the course; (b) passing a more advanced course in the same subject area; (c) passing a comprehensive examination in which the student demonstrates substantial knowledge of the content of the course; (d) teaching a comparable course; or (e) publishing scholarly research demonstrating fundamental principles of the course. Each course for which consideration for revalidation is being requested should be justified separately. Teacher Certification Students who wish to teach in Indiana public schools must meet the minimum state licensing requirements and obtain a standard license. More information is available from the certification office in the School of Education,Indiana University, Education 1074, 201 N. Rose Avenue, Bloomington, IN 47405-1006; phone (812) 856-8511. Time Limitations and Academic Deadlines Students are responsible for knowing the following time limits and academic deadlines. Maximum Time Span Between Admission and Initial Registration Initial registration in classes must occur within one year from the first day of classes of the term for the applicant intitially applied. Applicants who surpass the one year maximum must reapply if admission is desired. Maximum Time Span Between Initial Enrollment and Master's Degree Completion All requirements for a master's degree must be completed within six calendar years after initial enrollment in course work. Maximum Time Span Between Initial Registration and Completion of All Courses and the Qualifying Examination A student registered in a doctoral program must satisfactorily complete all course work and the qualifying examination within five years after the date of initial registration. Maximum Time Span Between Passing the Qualifying the Examination and Dissertation Submission The time limit for completion of the doctoral dissertation (including the dissertation defense and submission of the dissertation) is seven years from the date of passing the qualifying examination. Requalifying for candidacy is required if the dissertation is not completed within the seven- year period. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the termination of candidacy and of the student's enrollment in the degree program. Any student whose candidacy lapses will be required to apply for reinstatement before further work toward the degree may be formally done. (See also the section of this bulletin titled \"Dissertation Completion Within Seven Years.\") Minimum Time Span Between Passing the Qualifying Exam and Degree Conferral The date on which a student's Ph.D. degree is awarded must be at least eight months after the passing date of the qualifying examination. Minimum Time Span Between Research Committee Approval and Dissertation Defense A Ph.D. candidate may not defend the dissertation until at least six months have passed following University Graduate School approval of the membership of the student's research committee. Items which must be submitted together to request approval include: a completed form entitled, Nomination of Research Committee for the Ph.D.; an research project abstract; and a signed form indicating approval for any use of human or animal subjects. Minimum Time Span Between Applying for Graduation and Degree Conferral At least six months before the expected date of graduation, candidates for master's degrees must file an Application for Graduation at the following link: publichealth.indiana.edu/student-portal/graduation/ index.html . Ph.D. Conferral126 July 20, 2023 For doctoral students, submission to the University Graduate School of the copies of the completed dissertation and abstract as described under Submission of the Dissertation constitutes an application for conferral of the Ph.D. degree. Doctoral students are reminded: The 30-day announcement deadline prior to the defense of the dissertation and the 30- day deadline prior to degree conferral are non- overlapping time periods. Research committees frequently require revisions and corrections after the defense of the dissertation. These revisions must be made before the dissertation is ready for submission to the University Graduate School. Failure to file this application by the proper time may result in failure to graduate at the expected time. The responsibility for checking degree requirements rests with the student. Doctoral Dissertation Progress-Level Required to Apply for Graduation Doctoral students, who wish to participate in the May or December Commencement exercises, must submit their initial dissertation (and any formatting edits requested by the University Graduate School) by the appointed deadlines on the University Graduate School website . They must also submit a PhD Commencement Participation Application with the University Graduate School by the appointed due date, announced annually for each commencement ceremony. Arrangements for Commencement regalia are to be made with the Indiana University Bookstore in the Indiana Memorial Union. Diplomas will be mailed to the graduate's permanent address on file at the Office of the Registrar. Allow approximately eight weeks following the date of graduation for the delivery of diplomas. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: I am completing my master's degree in the therapeutic recreation, distance education program. I have skipped some semesters due to professional obligations. It looks like I will not complete my master's degree within the six year limit. Are there any exceptions to this rule? Is it possible for me to earn my degree now? Answer: Schedule a meeting or a telephone conversation with the executive associate dean to ask for an exception to this rule due to the nature of the distance education program. Question: I forgot to apply to graduate six months before my desired graduation date. Can I still apply? Answer: Yes, you may still apply for graduation. When you have satisfied both requirements of applying for graduation, and finishing your degree requirements, our records office will certify your degree at the first opportunity. However, applying late for graduation may result in an omission of your name in the graduation ceremony program. If the application comes in extremely late, it could result in a later graduation date than you desire.Question: If I plan to complete my requirements in July, but I wish to attend the graduation, commencement ceremony in May, what do I do? Answer: Apply for July graduation, but attend the May graduation commencement ceremony. All students graduating between January and August are invited to participate in the May graduation commencement ceremony. All students graduating between September and December may participate in the December graduation commencement ceremony. Just be sure to apply six months before your expected graduation date. Transfer of Credit Stipulations for transfer of graduate credit for use in Master of Science degrees may be found at this link: https://bulletins.iu.edu/iub/phb/2022-2023/policies/ masters-degree/transfer-credit.shtml Stipulations for transfer of graduate credit for use in Doctoral (PhD) degrees may be found at this link: https:// bulletins.iu.edu/iub/phb/2022-2023/policies/doctoral/ transfer-of-credit.shtml The Master of Public Health (MPH) degree does not allow the use of any transferred graduate-level coursework, no exceptions. Schedule Adjustment: Withdrawal from Courses A grade of W (Withdrawal) is given automatically when a withdrawal from course work occurs during a specific span of time after the late schedule adjustment period at the beginning of a regular semester or summer session. For the dates of this period, consult the Enrollment and Student Academic Information Bulletin. Thereafter, a W will be given only if the student is passing on the date of withdrawal and has an illness or employment obligation. If the student is failing on the date of withdrawal or stops attending class without officially withdrawing, a WF (Withdrawal with Failure) will be recorded on that date and will be treated as a failing grade. For further information regarding withdrawal dates and procedures, refer to the Enrollment and Student Academic Information Bulletin. Note: Reducing the number of credit hours will affect financial aid status, especially in relation to fellowships, scholarships, fee remissions, graduate work study, hourly work study, and scheduled repayment of loans. The details of specific awards should be reviewed before withdrawing to ascertain the effect of a reduction in total credit hours. LEAVES OF ABSENCE Taking a leave of absence Leaves of absence allow graduate students in the School of Public Health to deal with unforeseen events that interfere with their academic progress. During a leave you are not expected to make progress toward your degree. Although you may complete coursework from previous terms during a leave, you may not attend class or use the leave to catch up on current coursework, prepare for exams, or write your dissertation. After a leave of absence, you are expected to return to your program of study and resume progress toward yourJuly 20, 2023 127 degree. Leaves of absence may not be requested retroactively. Taking leave of absence does not pause the degree completion timeline: PhD students must take the doctoral qualifying examination by five (5) years from their first semester of admission into the PhD Program PhD students must defend their dissertation for their PhD Degree by seven (7) years after the passing of their doctoral qualifying examination. Master's students must complete their degree within 6 years of the first semester of enrollment. The SPH-G 901 course is strictly for doctoral candidates who have taken all 90 PhD degree credits, and there are no exceptions to this policy. Other stipulations for Student Academic Appointments, student funding, and student health insurance coverage may apply to the leave of absence, and will be disucssed with students along with their advisor and director of graduate studies upon taking leave, on a case-by-case basis. Applying for a leave of absence Before requesting a leave of absence, you must first discuss the leave and possible alternatives with your academic advisor, and the director of graduate studies for your major's department (or the department chair of your major's department). If you decide to proceed with your leave of absence request, you must follow fill out the Leave of Absence request form, which requires signatures of approval from your academic advisor, your department's director of graduate studies (or the department's chair), and the assistant dean of graduate studies. The form is contained online at this link: https://one.iu.edu/ task/iub/current-sph-students ; press \"start,\" select the \"Forms\" link, and scroll to the section \"For All Graduate Students\" to download the form. It is the student's responsibility to ensure this form is filled properly and receives all signatures of approval, and is sent to the Degree Administration team in a timely manner. Contact information for where to send the form is contained within the form itself. Graduation: Degree Application At least six months before the expected date of graduation, candidates for master's degrees must complete and submit an application to graduate at publichealth.indiana.edu/student-portal/graduation/ index.html . When submitted, this application is received by the School of Public Health-Bloomington Records Office. The school will not be responsible for the degree certification of master's degree students who fail to meet this requirement.

Master's Degree Students Graduation: Degree Application Joint Master's Degree Master's Degree - Double Major Minimum Master's Degree Requirements Revalidation of Courses Time Limitations Transfer of Credit Joint Master's Degrees To be eligible to earn two master's degrees, the student must be formally admitted by both degree-granting departments. All requirements for each degree must be met. If the student decides to complete a thesis, the thesis committee shall include two faculty members from the department where the thesis is being completed, and one faculty member from the department awarding the other degree. The student must complete a minimum of 20 credit hours from each department where the degrees will be awarded and must have a combined minimum of 55 credit hours for the two degrees. In many cases it will be possible to use courses taken in one major as part of the other major, especially when the same course is required in both departments, and courses taken in one department may serve as electives for the other degree when it is obvious that a close relationship exists. However, such courses may be counted only once for credit. In all cases, the academic advisor must recommend the use of course work from the second degree, and this use must be approved by the executive associate dean. Master's Degree - Double Major A student in the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington may complete two majors (areas of emphasis) under one master's degree with the following stipulations: All published degree requirements for both majors must be completed. A minimum of 44 credits that count toward the degree must be completed for any master's degree with a double major. A minimum of 12 credits of unique coursework must be completed for each of the majors, and may not overlap. A single course, which is required by both majors, may count toward completion of both majors. However, such a course counts only once for credit.128 July 20, 2023 Double major combinations must either both be online-only majors, or both be classroom-based majors. Students who wish to discuss an exception to this policy should contact the executive associate dean. Permissible M.P.H. degree double majors and their specific requirements are listed in this bulletin. Students are welcome to consult with M.P.H. degree advisors about additional combinations. Minimum Master's Degree Requirements Applicants are often admitted to Master's degree programs before they have completed the requirements for a Bachelor's degree. However, before a student may earn a Master's degree through the School of Public Health- Bloomington, the institution granting the Bachelor's degree must send a transcript displaying the degree to the SPH Degree Administration Office. Transcripts may be sent electronically or via mail, to the following contact: Mail: School of Public Health IU Bloomington Attn: Amy Shamanov, room PH 123 1025 E 7th St Bloomington, IN 47405 Electronic: Amy Shamanov Assistant Director of Graduate Degree Programs aloop@iu.edu For a Master of Science or Master of Public Health degree, students are required to successfully complete all degree program course and grading requirements. This information may be found for each individual degree program here: https://bulletins.iu.edu/iub/phb/2023-2024/graduate/ masters/index.shtml A maximum of 6 credit hours in independent study, readings, and research courses (not including internships) may be used to meet Master's degree requirements unless special permission is obtained from the assistant dean of graduate studies. A student must have at least a 3.0 GPA to enroll in independent study courses. Revalidation of Courses Coursework completed more than seven years before the starting date of student's master's degree program entry semester may not be used to satisfy the program's course requirements unless the student has remained current in the course subject matter. The student's graduate advisor may recommend to the executive associate dean that coursework taken before the seven- year time limit be revalidated if it can be demonstrated that the knowledge contained in the course(s) remains current. Currency of knowledge may be demonstrated by such accomplishments as: (a) passing an examination specifically on the material covered by the course; (b) passing a more advanced course in the same subject area; (c) passing a comprehensive examination in which the student demonstrates substantial knowledge of the content of the course; (d) teaching a comparable course; (e) publishing scholarly research demonstrating fundamental principles of the course; or (f) demonstratingcurrency of course subject matter through work experience within seven years of matriculation. Each course for which consideration for revalidation is being requested should be justified separately in a document presented to the executive associate dean for approval. Time Limitations Time Limitations Students are responsible for knowing the following time limits and academic deadlines. Maximum Time Span Between Application for Admission and Initial Registration Initial registration for courses must occur within two (2) years from the date of the submission of the application for admission. Applicants who surpass the two (2) year maximum must reapply if admission is desired. Maximum Time Span Between Initial Enrollment and Master's Degree Completion All requirements for a master's degree must be completed within six (6) calendar years after initial enrollment in course work. Minimum Time Span Between Applying for Graduation and Degree Conferral At least six (6) months before the expected date of graduation, candidates for master's degrees must file an Application for Graduation at the following link: https://publichealth.indiana.edu/student-portal/ graduation/index.html . Failure to file this application by the deadline may result in failure to graduate at the expected time. The responsibility for checking degree requirements rests with the student. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: I am completing my Master's degree in the online recreational therapy program. I have skipped some semesters due to professional obligations. It looks like I will not complete my master's degree within the six-year limit. Are there any exceptions to this rule? Is it possible for me to earn my degree now? Answer: Please reach out to the member of Degree Administration staff assigned to graduate student services, who will facilitate asking for an exception from the assistant dean of graduate studies. Question: I forgot to apply to graduate six months before my desired graduation date. Can I still apply? Answer: Yes, you may still apply for graduation. When you have satisfied both requirements of applying for graduation and finished your degree requirements, the degree administration staff will certify your degree at the first opportunity. However, applying late for graduation may result in an omission of your name in print materials related to graduation. If the application comes in extremely late, it could result in a later graduation date than you desire. Question: If I plan to complete my requirements in July, but I wish to attend the graduation events in May, what do I do? Answer: Apply for July graduation but attend the May graduation events. All students graduating between January and August are invited to participate in the May graduation events. All students graduating betweenJuly 20, 2023 129 September and December may participate in the December graduation events. Just be sure to apply six months before your expected graduation date. Transfer of Credit Transfer of Credit With the approval of a doctoral student's advisory committee chair and the assistant dean of graduate studies, graduate-level academic credit from another institution may be transferred for use in a School of Public Health-Bloomington doctoral degree. An official transcript from the registrar's office of the academic institution where the course work was completed must be on file in the School of Public Health- Bloomington records office. A copy of this transcript should accompany the request through its approval stages. It must be an official transcript, meaning it's sent directly from the issuing institution to the School of Public Health admissions team or graduate records administrator. The form to begin this process is located at https:// one.iu.edu/task/iub/current-sph-students : press \"start,\" and select the \"Forms\" link. Stipulations for transferability are as follows: A maximum of one-third of the required credit hours of an SPH Master of Science (MS) degree may be made up of transferred graduate-level coursework obtained at a previously attended institution. Allowance of transfer credits used towards a Master of Science (MS) degree are subject to approval from the doctoral advisory committee and the assistant dean of graduate studies. Transfer credits may not be used towards any of the Master of Public Health (MPH) degree programs, and there are no exceptions to this policy. Transfer credits from any kind of doctoral degree may not be used towards any IU Master's degree, and there are no exceptions to this policy. For MS degrees, coursework completed more than seven (7) years before graduation from the program must be revalidated via the Course Revalidation procedure in order to be approved and transferred. Authorization of revalidation methods are subject to approval by the SPH-B assistant dean of graduate studies. Please see this link for Course Revalidation methods and procedures: A minimum grade of B is required in each course to be transferred. A course with a grade of B-minus may not be transferred for use in a graduate degree. Grades of Pass (P) or Satisfactory (S) cannot be accepted unless there is official documentation from the transferring institution to verify that these grades are equivalent to at least a B on a graduate grading scale. It is the student's responsibility to obtain the required verification from an appropriate source, such as the professor of the course, the Registrar's Office of the institution where the course was completed, or an administrator of the institution. The verification must be on official university letterhead and issued by a university official from the issuing institution.No credit can be transferred for a course that cannot be officially documented as carrying graduate-level credit. The cumulative grade point average (GPA) for students in the School of Public Health-Bloomington is calculated using only Indiana University graded course work. Credits and grades in work transferred from other institutions are not used in the calculation of a student's Indiana University GPA. Application for Graduation At least six months before the expected date of graduation, candidates for master's degrees must complete and submit an application to graduate at publichealth.indiana.edu/student-portal/graduation/ index.html . When submitted, this application is received by the School of Public Health-Bloomington Records Office. The school will not be responsible for the degree certification of master's degree students who fail to meet this requirement.

September 25 is the last day on which names may be included in print materials related to December graduation events. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: How do I make sure my name will appear in the university's commencement printed program? Answer: To make sure your name appears in the university's commencement printed program, you should complete and submit the application for graduation at least six months before your desired graduation date. Question: I am a graduate student planning to complete the requirements for my degree in the near future, but not planning to attend the commencement ceremony. Do I still need to apply to graduate? Answer: Yes. All graduate degree-seeking students must apply for graduation, whether or not they are planning to attend the commencement ceremony. The graduation application is the only means of letting the graduate recorder know the student plans to complete the degree. This cues the recorder to audit a student's progress toward satisfaction of all degree requirements for a specific degree certification date. If you do not tell the recorder when you want to graduate, nothing happens.130 July 20, 2023 Thesis Completion Sequence The chronological steps in the master's thesis process are: Formation of a master's thesis committee Human and animal subjects approval Thesis proposal meeting Completion of thesis Application for graduation Defense of thesis Submission of required thesis materials Graduation Final Thesis Defense The student defends the master's thesis in a meeting with the student's master's thesis committee. It is a public meeting, open to students and faculty. The student should confer with the thesis committee chair regarding expectations. Complete the following steps to arrange the meeting: 1.If human subjects were used in the research, a copy of an approved clearance form for the use of human subjects must be in student's academic file in the School of Public Health-Bloomington records office. Submission of this form was required prior to the thesis proposal meeting. If the student's thesis proposal meeting resulted in changes to the research project, necessitating re-evaluation of the use of human subjects, an amended, approved, clearance form must be in the student's file before the defense may be scheduled. 2.The student and the master's thesis committee agree on a date and time for the student's final defense meeting. 3.At least five weeks in advance of the proposed meeting date, the student must complete and submit an Application to Schedule a Thesis Defense Meeting Form, available at one.iu.edu/task/iub/ current-sph-students . The completed form must be submitted to the administrative secretary for academic affairs in SPH 123. Following verification that the student's file contains an approved Human Subjects Approval Form, the secretary will reserve a meeting room. Confirmation of the meeting date, time, and location will be communicated to the student and the committee members via email. Following the defense meeting, the master's thesis committee chair will report the outcome to the School of Public Health-Bloomington recorder. The chair will also assign a letter grade to the thesis credits on the student's transcript. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: I have the results of my thesis research and I have my conclusions. How do I get my thesis committee to attest that I am finished? Answer: Defend your thesis in front of your thesis committee at a formal thesis defense meeting. Question: How do I arrange this meeting? Answer: Arrange the meeting date and time with members of your thesis committee. At least 40 calendar days before the defense date, submit an Application to Schedule a Thesis Defense Meeting Form to the administrative secretary for academic affairs in SPH room 123. Thesecretary will arrange a room and communicate all details to you and your committee. Question: Am I required to be enrolled when I defend my master's thesis? Answer: The School of Public Health-Bloomington does not require that master's students be enrolled during the semester or summer session for which they are defending their master's thesis. However, there are various reasons a student may need to be registered; e.g., assistantship awards, scholarships, insurance, compliance with SEVIS (for international students only), etc. Students should evaluate their individual situation and contact the appropriate source(s) to determine if enrollment is required. Question: I have successfully defended my master's thesis. How do I receive a grade for my master's thesis credit hours? Answer: Once you have successfully defended your master's thesis, master's thesis credit hours with a grade of \"R\" may be changed to a letter grade by the chair of your master's thesis committee, provided the thesis committee chair was the instructor of record for the thesis course and section in which you were registered. If the chair of your committee was not listed as instructor of record, he or she may report the grade to the School of Public Health-Bloomington graduate recorder, who will then report the grade. Grades will be reported during the normal final grade reporting period for semesters or summer sessions still in progress. Question: I am an international student who has enrolled in all coursework, including the required number of master's thesis credits for my master's degree program. I have not yet completed the requirements for my master's thesis. Which course do I enroll in now so that I meet SEVIS regulations and may remain in this country to finish my thesis? Answer: International master's thesis students who have already registered for the number of thesis credits required by their master's degree program and have not completed requirements for the thesis may enroll in SPH-G 599 (Thesis Research). This course carries no credit, but satisfies the enrollment requirement for international students to remain in compliance with SEVIS regulations. SPH-G 599 is not offered during the summer term. Formation of a Thesis Committee When a student is admitted to the thesis option, a member of the graduate faculty will be appointed to serve as the student's advisor and as the chair of the master's thesis committee. This committee consists of the chair and at least two other Indiana University graduate faculty members. The chair of the committee must be a graduate faculty member in the department in which the student's degree is being pursued. While students often wish to have a member of the committee from an institution other than Indiana University, such an individual may serve only as a consultant for the committee, but not as one of the three required members. Information regarding the eligibility of faculty members to serve on the master's thesis committee is available on the University Graduate School Roster of Graduate Faculty at graduate.indiana.edu/faculty-staff/membership.html . A Nomination of master's Thesis Committee Form, approved by the members, must be submitted to the Records Office.July 20, 2023 131 The form may be found online at one.iu.edu/task/iub/ current-sph-students .The research proposal meeting may not be scheduled before the executive associate dean approves the submitted master's Thesis Committee Form. The chair/advisor will guide all phases of the thesis development. After the thesis topic has been identified, the student must prepare a detailed outline of the research proposal. The outline must then be submitted to the committee for approval. The committee is also responsible for the evaluation of the completed thesis. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: How many people must be on my thesis committee? Answer: The master's thesis committee is made up of a minimum of three faculty members. Question: What are the qualifications for faculty on a thesis committee? Answer: All thesis committee members, including the chair, must have Indiana University graduate faculty status. While doctoral committee chairs must have a special endorsement to chair those committee, such an endorsement is not required to chair a Master's thesis committee. Question: How do I find out if a faculty member is qualified to be on my thesis committee? Answer: Visit the University Graduate School Roster of Graduate Faculty at graduate.indiana.edu/faculty-staff/ membership.html . Search the PDF document on this websitefor the name of the faculty member. Question: Can I have more than three members on my thesis committee? Answer: Yes, you may have more than three thesis committee members if you wish, but please remember that the difficulty of arranging a time for the proposal and defense meetings increases exponentially for each member you add to your committee. Question: I have three faculty members with graduate faculty status who have agreed to serve on my master's Thesis Committee. I would like to add a fourth member as a consultant, but this person does not have graduate faculty status. Is it possible for this person to serve as a consultant on my committee and if so, what is the procedure? Answer: Persons listed on a master's thesis committee as a consultant must either hold graduate faculty status or submit a curriculum vitae (CV) in combination with the nomination of master's thesis committee form to the Assistant Director of Graduate Degree Programs . This consultant faculty member is subject to the approval of the executive associate dean. Also, please remember that it is more difficult to schedule meetings if you add an extra person to your committee. Human and Animal Subjects Approval Indiana University requires that all research using human subjects be approved before the research begins. This requirement ensures protection of the rights and welfare of persons used in research. It also satisfies a number of federal, state, and institutional regulations. If a research project involves human subjects, no data may be collected until documentation of clearance for the use of humansubjects has been obtained. No thesis or dissertation will be accepted for which such clearance has not been obtained. Forms and procedures for this purpose are available online at research.iu.edu/compliance/human- subjects/index.html . If human subjects are to be used in research, an approved clearance form for the use of human subjects must be obtained and a copy must be submitted to the School of Public Health-Bloomington records office, SPH 123, before the student may begin data collection. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: My research project is qualitative, and will not involve use of human or animal subjects. Do I need to submit a copy of an approved human subjects form? Answer: No. Question: My research project will involve a collection of data from human or animal subjects. How do I obtain approval for my project? Answer: Visit research.iu.edu/compliance/human-subjects/ index.html and follow the directions to obtain approval for your use of human subjects. When you have a signed Human Subjects Approval Form, please submit a copy of that form to the School of Public Health-Bloomington records office in SPH Room 123. Master's Thesis Students Thesis Completion Sequence Formation of a Thesis Committee Human and Animal Subjects Approval Thesis Proposal Final Thesis Defense Submission of Thesis Materials Application for Graduation Submission of Thesis Materials There are two thesis submission options: open access and limited access . A student who elects to allow open access may submit the thesis electronically. In this case, the thesis will be published on the IU ScholarWorks website, which is maintained by the IU Library system. A more restrictive submission option allows a student to limit access to their thesis by submitting a copy to the assistant director of graduate degree administration, and requesting that the access to the thesis is limited. In this case, a copy of the thesis must be sent to the assistant director of graduate degree programs . Under this option, access to a printed, bound copy will be managed by the School of Public Health-Bloomington Library. Open access submission is the far more popular choice among graduate students due to the expense of producing bound copies, and a willingness by most students to share the results of their research with others. Students who wish to allow open access may submit their thesis materials directly to IU Scholarworks. Steps to Open Access Thesis Submission: 1.The student must successfully defend their master's thesis, and the thesis must be in its final form132 July 20, 2023 approved by the student's thesis committee before submission. 2.Once the assistant director of graduate degree programs has been notified via the Internal Report Form that the student has passed their thesis defense, and the student's committee has confirmed to the student that the thesis is ready to be submitted, the student may initiate the online form at IU Scholarworks to submit their thesis. 3.The student must follow the formatting guidelines from the University Graduate School: graduate.indiana.edu/thesis-dissertation/formatting/ masters.html . The student should not submit their thesis via ProQuest, and use this link only as a guideline for formatting. 4.The student must submit their master's thesis at openscholarship.indiana.edu/etd-form . Upon submission of the items listed above, students who have completed all other master's degree requirements will be approved to graduate. master's degrees are awarded in May, June, July, and December. As stated under \"Application for Graduation,\" students should apply to graduate at least six months before requirements are competed in order to be listed in print materials related to graduation events. Steps to Limited-Access Thesis Submission: 1.The student must follow the formatting guidelines from the University Graduate School: graduate.indiana.edu/thesis-dissertation/formatting/ masters.html The student should not submit their thesis via ProQuest, and use this link only as a guideline for formatting. 2.The student must send the Word document of the Thesis to the assistant director of graduate degree programs . This document must be proofread and acceptable to both the student and the student's Master's thesis committee chair. No handwritten signatures may be included in this document. A signed acceptance page with the signatures of the members of the thesis committee is required to confirm that the committee members have viewed and accepted the final draft of the thesis which the student is submitting. The acceptance signed by the thesis committee members may be completed in person and scanned, or it may be signed using verified, electronic signatures in Adobe Acrobat, and then attached as a separate PDF file, to the same email message to which the thesis document is attached. Upon receipt of the items listed above, students who have completed all other master's degree requirements will be approved to graduate. Master's degrees are awarded in May, June, July, and December. As stated under \"Application for Graduation,\" students should apply to graduate at least six months before requirements are all competed in order to be listed in print materials related to graduation events. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: Why are there two submission options? Answer: The Indiana University Library system may not force students to allow publication of their master's thesison the IU Scholarworks Website. For this reason, the limited access thesis submission form exists. Question: Which one of the options is more popular? Answer: The open access option is far more popular. In fact, as of the date on which this bulletin was published, no master's thesis student has chosen to submit a thesis under the limited access option. Question: I am submitting my thesis under the open access option. I have seen signed acceptance pages in bound theses. Why are no signatures allowed in the Microsoft Word thesis document? Answer: The Indiana University Library system will be posting your thesis on the IU ScholarWorks Website. It is not advisable to post documents with signatures on the Internet due to the potential for fraud and identity theft. Question: Do I graduate as soon as I turn in my thesis materials? Answer: You are eligible to graduate when you have successfully completed all course, credit, and GPA requirements for your degree program, and when you have submitted your required thesis materials. When these requirements have been met, you are eligible to graduate on the next possible degree conferral date. Master's degrees are conferred in May, June, August, and December. Your application for graduation should list the date on which you plan to graduate. If submission of required materials happens after your expected graduation date, please check with the School of Public Health- Bloomington recorder to learn the next possible graduation date, and update your graduation application. Thesis Proposal A student's thesis committee must formally approve the student's research project before it begins. To earn official approval, the student must present a research proposal at a public proposal meeting, open to faculty and students. If the proposed research involves human subjects, animals, biohazards, or radiation, approval from the appropriate institutional review board (IRB) must also be obtained prior to the beginning of data collection. Information on the use of human subjects in research may be found at: research.iu.edu/compliance/ human-subjects/index.html . The thesis proposal meeting may take place before or after IRB clearance for the use of human subjects has been obtained. Complete the following steps to arrange the meeting: 1.The student and the master's thesis committee agree on a date and time for the student's proposal meeting. 2.Ten (10) days in advance of the proposed meeting, the student completes and submits the Application to Schedule a Graduate Student Meeting Form, available at one.iu.edu/task/iub/current-sph- students. 3.The Assistant Director of Graduate Degree Programs will verify that the student's Nomination of Master's Thesis Committee Form has been approved and submitted. They will then reserve a meeting room. Confirmation of the meeting date, time, and location will be communicated to the student and the committee members via email.July 20, 2023 133 During the first portion of the proposal meeting, the student formally presents the research proposal in an open forum. Committee members and visitors have the opportunity to ask questions. Visitors leave after the formal presentation. The remaining time is determined by the student's research committee. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: How do I make sure I am on the right track with the research project I choose? Answer: Present your research proposal to your thesis committee at a formal thesis proposal meeting. At this meeting, your committee will help you finalize your plans before you move forward. Absences Confirmed illness is usually the only acceptable excuse for absence from class. A student who misses a final examination and who has a passing grade up to that time is given a temporary grade of \"I\" for incomplete if the instructor has reason to believe the absence was beyond the student's control. The Office of the Dean of Students reviews excuses for absences from final examinations and notifies instructors of its decisions. Academic Dismissal Students will be dismissed from the School of Public Health-Bloomington when, in the judgment of the Scholarship and Probation Committee, they have ceased to make academic progress toward their degrees. Students who fail to attain a minimum grade point average of 2.0 in any two semesters and who have a cumulative grade point average below 2.0 will be dismissed automatically. (Note that these students will have been placed on probation at some point before their dismissal.) A student who has been dismissed will be prevented from enrolling for classes through the School of Public Health- Bloomington for at least one full semester. During this absence, a student may submit a petition to the committee for readmission. Academic misconduct (cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, interference, violation of course rules, or facilitating academic dishonesty) may also result in a student's dismissal from the school. Consult the university Code of Conduct & Policies for more information. Academic Probation Students are placed on academic probation for the semester following the one in which they failed to earn a C (2.0) average. Students remain on probation as long as they fall below a C average in a given semester or if their cumulative grade point average drops below 2.0. Academic Standing Candidate for Bachelor's Degree in Good Standing Students are considered to be candidates in good standing for an Indiana University bachelor's degree when: they have been officially admitted by the Office of Admissions. their academic grade point average is at or above 2.0 for the last semester's work. their cumulative grade point average is at least 2.0.Consult other sections in this bulletin on the specific program of study for additional degree standards. Class Standing Class standing is based on the number of credit hours completed: Freshman: fewer than 30 cr. Sophomore: 30 to 59 cr. Junior: 60 to 89 cr. Senior: 90 or more cr. Schedule Adjustment: Addition of Courses No course may be added by undergraduate students after the first week of a regular semester or summer session unless: The instructor of the course approves a petition that an exception be made, and The request is approved by both: The chair of the department offering the course, and The dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. Admission The admission process for each School of Public Health- Bloomington academic program is described on the individual program's page in this bulletin. Visit the undergraduate section of this bulletin, and choose the type of program. Then choose the individual, desired academic program. The desired program's page will include information about the admission process for that program. Advising Because the advisor-student relationship is so beneficial to the student's academic progress and career planning, School of Public Health-Bloomington students are required to meet with their assigned SPH advisor each semester before registering for classes. During these meetings, a student and advisor identify the courses in which the student will enroll for the following term, then the advisor authorizes the records office to provide clearance for the student to register for classes. Online academic advisement reports and degree requirement tab sheets are two effective tools used by advisors and students to track academic progress. Academic Advisement Reports (AARs), available in One.IU, allow students to view their completed and enrolled course credits, as well as those requirements that remain unfinished. In addition, requirements for each degree program are outlined on degree requirement tab sheets, available online. The tab sheet for each academic program specifies such requirements as total credit hours needed for completion of the degree, courses to be taken, GPA requirements, suggested electives, and other information. These advising tools are used by students and their academic advisors to guide the selection of courses and monitor progress. Adhering to stated requirements is the student's responsibility.134 July 20, 2023 Bachelor's Degree - Double Major A student may decide to complete two majors within the same degree with a few exceptions. It is not possible for a student to pursue these double major combinations: exercise science and health fitness specialist. human development and family studies and youth development. The academic requirements are too similar between the majors in these combinations to allow the double major. To earn a double major, all requirements for each program of study must be met. The student may use the same course to satisfy requirements in each major when that course is required in each degree program. However, such courses may only be used once for credit. Course Load An undergraduate student is expected to carry 12 to 18 credit hours of academic work per semester. The average semester load is 15 credits. A minimum enrollment of 12 credits per semester is required for eligibility for most financial aid. The Office of the Registrar restricts undergraduate student enrollment to a maximum of 19 credits per semester. The maximum enrollment for an undergraduate student during the entire summer term is 20 credits. Course Load for International Students Monitored by SEVIS The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has created the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to maintain current information on nonimmigrant students, exchange visitors, and their dependents (i.e., all those in the F or J visa status). Undergraduate students monitored by SEVIS must maintain full-time enrollment (at least 12 credit hours for undergraduates) during fall and spring semesters. For more information about SEVIS, visit ois.indiana.edu . Degree Requirements: Credit Hours School of Public Health-Bloomington academic programs have the following credit hour requirements: All baccalaureate degrees require a minimum of 120 credit hours for graduation. Undergraduate certificates require 24 credit hours. Undergraduate minor credit hour requirements range from 15 to 21 credit hours. Dean's List Honors A student who earns a minimum 3.8 term grade point average (GPA) in at least 12 graded hours in a single semester, or in the entire summer term, receives the honor of being placed on the dean's list. Students are notified of this honor via their IU email address. Students often note this accomplishment on resumes and related materials. Graduation: Degree Application A candidate for graduation must complete and submit an application to graduate at publichealth.indiana.edu/ student-portal/graduation/index.html . The school is not responsible for the degree certification of seniors who fail to meet this requirement. MAY GRADUATION CEREMONY : Students who will complete degree requirements in May, June, or July may participate in May graduation events. These students are strongly encouraged to complete and submit the application to graduate by October 1 of the previous year. October 1 is the priority date which guarantees efficient processing of the application. February 25 is the last day on which names may be included in print materials related to graduation events. DECEMBER GRADUATION CEREMONY : Students who will complete degree requirements in December may participate in December graduation events. These students are strongly encouraged to complete and submit the application to graduate by May 1 of the same year. May 1 is the priority date which guarantees efficient processing of the application. October 1 is the last day on which names may be included in print materials related to graduation events Question: I am a student planning to complete the requirements for my degree in the near future, but not planning to attend commencement. Do I still need to apply to graduate? Answer: Yes. All degree-seeking students must apply for graduation, whether or not they are planning to attend commencement. The graduation application is the only means of letting the School's Records Office know that you plan to complete the requirements for your degree. Your application cues the recorder to audit your progress toward completion of all degree requirements for a specific degree certification date. If you do not tell the recorder when you want to graduate, nothing happens. Elective Courses Elective courses are identified on degree requirement tab sheets . All programs provide elective courses to allow flexibility in the student's academic preparation. Students should consult with their academic advisors before choosing elective courses. There are two types of elective courses: specialized electives, chosen from a prescribed list; and free electives, chosen from the entire list of university offerings. Free electives allow students to enroll in any course, except as indicated below in the \"Restrictions\" section of these policies. These free elective credit hours may count toward the total credit hours required for the degree and may be taken under the Pass/Fail option. Students may wish to take free electives for personal enrichment. Grade Replacement Policy: Extended X Extended X Policy: Policy and Procedure on Course Reenrollment and Recalculation of Student Grade Point Average Any undergraduate student may retake a course for which they received a grade below A. Upon completion of the retaken course, the GPA for a student applying this option will be adjusted to exclude the grade for the replaced course. A student may exercise this option for no more than three courses, totaling no more than 10 credits. A student may use this option only once for a given course. A student must apply this option before the student's degree is certified.July 20, 2023 135 The student must submit a completed, signed Extended X Request Form to the School of Public Health- Bloomington records office in SPH 123. Students are responsible for obtaining, completing, and submitting the form. They may obtain, complete, and submit the form in the School of Public Health- Bloomington Records Office, SPH 123. Additional Restrictions: The following grades cannot be replaced under this policy: S, P, W, I, R, and NC (no credit). A student may not replace a grade with a second grade of W, I, R, or NC. Topics courses are not eligible for replacement under this policy unless the retaken course is identical in content to the replaced course. A student may not request reversal after asking for and applying the GPA exclusion. Grade Appeal The following procedures exist for a student who believes that a grade earned in a School of Public Health- Bloomington course is unfair: The student must first attempt to resolve the dispute with the course instructor of record. If a resolution cannot be reached between the student and instructor, the student then must complete and submit a formal appeal to the department which offers the course, using the Grade Appeal Application Form available online. All supporting documentation must be included with the form. This packet must be submitted to the departmental office, addressed to the authority who deals with departmental grade appeals. (Please contact the department to determine who handles appeals.) The formal complaint will be considered by the departmental authority within fourteen (14) working days, during which time departmental authority may request additional information from both the student and instructor. The departmental authority will serve as a mediator between the student and instructor. If the issue is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, the student may appeal the outcome to the School of Public Health Academic Fairness Committee. This request is to be made in writing and submitted to the Office of the Executive Associate Dean of the School of Public Health (PH 111), addressed to the Academic Fairness Committee. The Academic Fairness Committee will study the documentation and conduct a hearing on the case within fourteen (14) days, at which time, both the student and instructor will be present. The decision of the committee will be the determination of the case at the school level. Appeals of grades should be made as soon as possible after the end of the semester. Requests for consideration of an appeal must occur within one calendar year from the end of the term in which the course was taken. Requests after this time limit will not be considered.Degree Requirements: Grade Point Average Quality points are assigned for purposes of determining the cumulative grade point average (GPA), as follows: A + or A 4 credit points; D- 0.7; and F 0. No points are assigned for grades of I (Incomplete), S (Satisfactory), P (Pass), or W (Withdrawal). A minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 is required for the baccalaureate degree. In addition, a minimum GPA of 2.0 is required for all courses completed in the major area and in the minor area. Completion of ENG-W 131 (3 cr.) or equivalent with a minimum grade of C is a general requirement of all students in the school. Note: Although coursework may be transferred to Indiana University from another institution, only the grades earned in courses taken at Indiana University will be used to compute a student's grade point average. Graduate Credit for Undergraduates Candidates for a bachelor of science degree at Indiana University who are within 5 credit hours of completing requirements for that degree, when granted specific approval, may take certain graduate courses for graduate credit during the last undergraduate semester. Courses used to fulfill requirements for the undergraduate degree may not be used to fulfill requirements for a graduate degree. Graduation with Honors Outstanding students with a minimum of 60 graded credit hours from Indiana University are recognized upon graduation with the following designations: distinction, for those with cumulative GPAs of 3.5 to 3.74; high distinction, for those with GPAs of 3.75 to 3.89; and highest distinction, for those with GPAs of 3.9 to 4.0. These students will have their designations noted on their transcripts and diplomas. Additionally, special honors cords are provided to students to wear with their gowns at the graduation ceremony. Students will be notified and may pick up their honors cords in the School of Public Health-Bloomington records office, Room 123. Student Research and Human Subjects Indiana University requires that all research using human subjects be approved before the research begins. This satisfies a number of federal, state, and institutional regulations, and\u2014more importantly\u2014ensures protection of the rights and welfare of persons used in research. Every research proposal submitted by a student and/or faculty member must contain documentation that clearance has been obtained for the use of human subjects. A faculty member must sponsor this research. Forms and procedures for this purpose are available online at research.iu.edu/compliance/human-subjects/review- levels/index.html . Grade of Incomplete The grade of I is given only under circumstances beyond the student's control that prohibit completion of the course on time and when the work of the course is substantially136 July 20, 2023 completed and of passing quality. When an Incomplete is assigned, a record must be maintained in the office of the department in which the grade was given. The record will include a statement of the reason for recording the Incomplete and adequate guidance for its removal, with a suggested final grade in the event of the departure or extended absence of the instructor from the campus. To receive notification of a removal of Incomplete, the student must contact the instructor. A student must complete the course and the instructor must replace the Incomplete with a grade within one calendar year from the date of its recording. The dean, however, may authorize adjustment of this period in exceptional circumstances. If the student fails to remove the Incomplete within the time allowed, the dean will authorize the Office of the Registrar to change the grade to F. Both the student and the instructor will be notified of this change in grade. If an instructor requests that the student retake the course to have an incomplete grade replaced with an actual grade, the student should not re-register for the course. In this case, the instructor who recorded the grade of I should replace it with the grade the student earns when the retaken course is completed. Once a student has graduated, an incomplete grade may remain on the official record. These regulations do not apply to research and reading courses in which completion of the course work is not necessarily required at the end of the semester. Incomplete work in these courses will be denoted by a grade of R (deferred grade). A grade of R (Deferred) indicates that the nature of the course is such that the work of the student can be evaluated only after two or more terms.

Only free electives may be taken Pass/Fail, unless otherwise stipulated by the specific degree requirements. It is the responsibility of the student to check the major or emphasis area to determine specific restrictions. Decisions to take courses Pass/Fail must be processed with the Office of the Dean in the School of Public Health- Bloomington. Students should refer to the IU Enrollment and Student Academic Information Bulletin regarding Pass/Fail deadlines for a specific semester or summer session. A grade of P is not counted in computing grade point averages, but a grade of F is counted. A grade of P may not be changed to any other letter grade. Readmission The School of Public Health-Bloomington is not obligated to readmit students who have been dismissed. Students who have been dismissed from the school for academic reasons are normally considered for reinstatement only after at least one regular (fall or spring) semester. To be considered for reinstatement, a student must submit a reinstatement application form, available from the School of Public Health-Bloomington records office, Room 123. Requests for readmission cannot be considered if the university has placed the records on hold for any reason, such as for outstanding fees. In considering a request for readmission, the committee will need to be convinced that the student now has sufficient aptitude to pursue the intended program of study. Students must also show signs of evolving maturity, increased commitment to their education, and adequate financial resources without excessive employment. In granting readmission, the committee may require special conditions, such as a 12-credit-hour maximum enrollment per semester; regular tutoring sessions; participation in relevant professional organizations; or registration in writing, reading, and/or study skills courses. Degree Requirement Exceptions Under extraordinary circumstances, a degree requirement exception, such as a course substitution or waiver, may be made for an admitted School of Public Health-Bloomington student. To initiate a request for such an exception, the student's SPH advisor must complete and sign a Course Substitution Request Form. The advisor or the student must then deliver the form to the records office, SPH 123. A final approval or denial decision will be made by the executive associate dean. A copy of the reviewed form with a decision will be sent to the initiating advisor for notification. (Important note: Approved course substitution requests cannot be entered into a student's online academic advising report until the course to be used as a substitute for a required course is on the student's transcript with a grade that satisfies the original course requirement.)July 20, 2023 137 If the substituting course is on the student's transcript with an appropriate grade, the student should monitor the degree progress report to make sure the requested academic exception has been made. If the substituting course is not yet on the student's transcript with an appropriate grade the student must check with the advisor to find out whether or not the course substitution request is approved. Residence A minimum of 30 of the last 60 credit hours of university work that count toward a degree must be completed in person on the Bloomington campus of Indiana University. Restrictions Credit earned in courses below the 100 level cannot be applied toward a degree. Credit for SLST-T 101 and other SLST credit used for English language improvement may not count toward a degree. A maximum of 3 credit hours in EDUC-M 135 Self-Instruction in Art can be counted toward a degree. Second Bachelor's Degree A student who is interested in pursuing a second undergraduate degree in the School of Public Health- Bloomington must complete the following steps: 1.Meet with a School of Public Health-Bloomington undergraduate advisor in the department where the second degree is to be pursued to discuss the appropriateness of the second undergraduate degree and review alternative ways to achieve your academic and career goals (e.g., a minor, a certificate program, or a graduate program in the academic area). 2.Complete the application for a second undergraduate degree in the School of Public Health records office, room 123. If the entrance requirements for the major have been met, the School of Public Health- Bloomington records office will notify the applicant in an official admission letter. Second Undergraduate School of Public Health- Bloomington Degree Regulations A student may earn two different bachelor's degrees as long as at least 21 unique credits can be identified (which the student must complete\u2014in addition to one degree\u2014to earn the other degree). In the case of students who wish to earn two different Bachelor of Science in Public Health (B.S.P.H.) degrees, a separate professional experience must be completed for each degree. If the first degree is from another college or university, the applicant must apply to Indiana University through the Office of Admissions . If the first degree is from an Indiana University campus other than Bloomington, the applicant must satisfy the School of Public Health-Bloomington residence requirement, which states that 30 out of the last 60 credit hours must be completed at the Bloomington campus of Indiana University. The second degree must differ from the first degree. A student may not complete another major under the first degree and earn a second identical degree. A student pursuing a second undergraduate degree may not enroll in graduate course work unlessenrolled in the last semester for both undergraduate majors. Student Responsibilities Students are responsible for planning their own programs and for meeting the degree requirements for graduation. For advice in fulfilling these requirements and in planning a course of study, students in the School of Public Health-Bloomington should regularly seek out academic counseling from their School of Public Health-Bloomington academic advisors. Although faculty and academic advisors will do their best to aid students, it is ultimately each student's responsibility to plan an appropriate academic course of study and to fulfill the various degree requirements. Familiarizing themselves with the contents of this Bulletin is a crucial first step that students can and should take to ensure familiarity with the opportunities available to and requirements expected of all students in the School of Public Health-Bloomington. Online academic advisement reports and degree requirement tab sheets are two effective tools used by advisors and students to track academic progress. Academic Advisement Reports (AARs), available in One.IU, allow students to view their completed and enrolled course credits, as well as those requirements that remain unfinished. Students who need clarification regarding any information on their AAR or any of the requirements for their degree program are urged to contact their academic advisor or the School of Public Health-Bloomington Recorder's Office (School of Public Health 123). Finally, Indiana University reserves the right to change course offerings without notice. Students are responsible for consulting the online Schedule of Classes for the most up-to-date listing. Time Limit for Bachelor's Degree Completion A student who fails to complete a bachelor of science degree within eight years of matriculation will forfeit the automatic right to use the requirements in effect at the time of matriculation. In such cases, the student should contact their SPH academic advisor, or the School of Public Health-Bloomington records office, room 123. The student's degree program will be re-evaluated, and the student may be required to move to the program in effect at the time of reevaluation. Schedule Adjustment: Withdrawal from Courses A grade of W (Withdrawal) is given automatically when a withdrawal occurs during a specific span of time after the final schedule adjustment period at the beginning of a regular semester or summer session. For the dates of this period, consult the IU Enrollment and Student Academic Information Bulletin. Withdrawals that would reduce a student's enrollment below 12 credit hours or interrupt progress toward satisfaction of specific area requirements will not be authorized. Petitions for withdrawal after the periods specified above will not be authorized by the dean of a student's school except for urgent reasons related to extended illness or138 July 20, 2023 equivalent distress. The desire to avoid a low grade is not an acceptable reason for withdrawal from a course. If the student withdraws with the dean's consent, the mark in the courses shall be W if the student is passing at the time of withdrawal and F if the student is not passing. The grade will be recorded on the date of withdrawal. Failure to complete a course without authorized withdrawal will result in a grade of F. Academic Policies & Procedures Academic policies and procedures have been developed and approved by faculty to govern and facilitate student academic progress. These policies and procedures exist for undergraduate students, all graduate students, master's degree students, master's thesis students, and doctoral degree students.
