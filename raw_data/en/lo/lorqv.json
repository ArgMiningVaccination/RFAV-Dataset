Massage Therapy [Read More](3-description) Massage therapy is the scientific manipulation of the soft tissues of the body, consisting primarily of manual (hands-on) techniques such as applying fixed or movable pressure, holding, and moving muscles and body tissues. Generally, massage is delivered to improve the flow of blood and lymph, to reduce muscular tension, to affect the nervous system through stimulation or sedation, and to enhance tissue healing. Reflexology [Read More](4-description) Reflexology is a natural healing therapy originating in Egypt and China around 2000 BC. It is a holistic therapy that works on the principle that the feet mirror the body and the practitioner applies pressure to all parts of the feet thus stimulating the 7,000 nerve endings. Reflexology is a 'holistic' therapy it treats the whole person via the feet, bringing all the body systems and energy flow into balance and correcting the negative factors involved in the disease process: congestion, inflammation and tension. Reflexology encourages the healing process to begin, the healing power of hands on treatment creates the environment through which self-healing can occur Rolfing Structural Integration [Read More](5-description) Rolfing\u00ae Structural Integration is a process of negotiating with the body's connective tissues through contact and education to facilitate changes that allow the body to think, feel and move with greater ease during the day. As a Rolfer I am using my hands to assist the body toward alignment in the gravitational field where it can feel more comfort and balanced. Rolfing\u00ae Structural Integration is an interactive form of therapy where the Rolfer works with skillful techniques of both touch and movement requests while the client works with their own breath and small movement patterns. Each muscle fiber, organ, nerve and blood vessel is surrounded by connective tissue called fascia. Each joint, bone, tendon and ligament is also wrapped with this multi-dimensional web-like tissue. Fascia is being considered a complex sensory organ that weaves around, connecting with and 'communicating' throughout the entire body during times of motion and stillness. Rolfing\u00ae Structural Integration is manipulating this fascia by considering the body's wholistic organization and balancing it in the gravitational field. Traditionally, this process is performed in the 10-series format. Please review the chart below (found after video link) for a description of the 10 -series or from this website from the Rolfing\u00ae Association of Canada. https://rolfingcanada.org/iprs-10-series/ Watch the video below to learn more about Rolfing\u00ae or enjoy the advanced reading on the website of the Rolfing\u00ae Association of Canada. http://rolfingcanada.org/fascia-in-gravity/ Naturopathic Medicine [Read More](6-description) Naturopathic medicine treats all health concerns for all ages from acute to chronic and physical to psychological.
