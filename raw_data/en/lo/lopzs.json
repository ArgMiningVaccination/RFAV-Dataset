From the late 1860s on, herbalists expanded their healing system beyond their ethnic community, transforming Chinese medicine into one of the healing practices most widely adopted by the local population. This article uses a comparative approach to examine the diverging trajectories of Chinese healers in Peru and the USA, as well as the social and political factors that determined how this foreign medical knowledge adapted to its new environments. Historia, Ciencias, Saude - llegaron mitad del siglo XIX jugaron un rol clave de la medicina china en ambos contextos. Desde nes transformando medicina en una de las de sanacion mas los foraneo, en su nuevo entorno. Medicine Across Cultures The legal struggle between pharmacists and herbalists in Turkey became actual again, as new regulations are put to force in 2012. In Turkey, legal regulations are steadily changing in favor of pharmacists and against the professional interests of herbalists since the 19th century. Taking into account the dissolved organisational system with which herbalists transmit professional knowledge, the question emerges as to how herbalists respond to ongoing political, economic and cultural change. The transformation of the legal framework that mark the domain of herbalists in Turkey, points to increasing bureaucratization and state involvement. The first historical encounter between herbalists and pharmacists started the process of radical change in the field of drug production in Ottoman lands, already in 1850's. After the first certified pharmacists graduated from the pharmacy class of the Istanbul Imperial Medical Faculty in 1840, the first regulation prohibiting the production of drugs by anyone without a pharmacy diploma followed in 1853. Today, the Herbalist Associations are struggling to bring formal education into their professional practice, so that the limits of their area of expertise can be protected against competing market agents. However, the shift to school-trained and state-certified herbalists means a major change in the texture of this traditional urban healing profession. Globalization and cultural interaction, new lifestyles, the diffusion of ''modern medicine'', the transformation of traditional religious practices and beliefs, have profoundly challenged and modified indigenous health systems. This paper questions whether due to these changes traditional healing systems are to some extent converging into ''herbalism'' and losing ties with their original cultural systems. By analyzing the healing practices of two communities (Maasai and Meru) in the rural ward of Ngar-enyanyuki (Northern Tanzania), the paper explores how traditional and modern health knowledge circulates , changes, and evolves. Evidence from the case study shows that herbal remedies play an increasingly key role in traditional healing practices. Nevertheless, Maasai and Meru health knowledge emerges as a rich and challenging mix of evolving practices. The paper discusses these ongoing processes and inputs into the debate on health provision in African countries by underlining the need for a policy transition to more holistic healing systems which may provide highly desirable options in the current context of health reforms. 2012 2011 Based on Western and Chinese sources, this essay employs a transnational approach to explain the establishment of the Tung Wah or Oriental Dispensary in San Francisco. the article describes the institution's aims, financing and combined operation of Western and Chinese medical staffs in an environment of racial discrimination and political power struggles as well as deep social and cultural divisions during the early 20th century plague epidemic. The Long Way Home: The Integration of Traditional Medicine Into the Peruvian Healthcare System This study deals with the exploration, systematisation and analysis of existing discourses in relation to the articulation of traditional medicine in the official healthcare system in Peru. The focus is on the identification of fundamental thematic guidelines and socio-cultural and anthropological factors on the topic with particular importance for anthropological theory construction and policy making. The work is inspired by approaches of medical anthropology and ethnomedicine, as well as post-colonial and alternative development studies. The starting point is based on empirical data collection on the basis of theme-centred interviews, ethnographies and participant observation with traditional healers, scholars and research experts on traditional medicine, academic and health authorities, physicians and health workers, alternative health practitioners and social activists in the regions of Lima, La Libertad, Ica, and Lambayeque. The collected data was complemented with document research, the achievement, systematisation and analysis of policy documents; scientific literature and archive search; according to the strategies of the grounded theory and other methods of qualitative research, in particular the content analysis. The investigation reveals a number of anthropological factors that are relevant in terms of the feasibility of an official formulation of traditional medicine in Peru. The analysis and systematisation of these results leads to the identification of five models that provide important theoretical positions for the healthcare system's integration: 1. the harmonisation or standardisation model, 2. the intercultural approach revisited, or the \"intercambio de saberes\", 3. the community-based approach, 4. the educational approach, and 5. the cultural heritage approach. The differences in the concepts underlying these five models reflect the different views and content deemed essential related to the integration of indigenous medicines in official care systems. They describe processes and structures that are of outstanding importance for understanding the development and representation of cultural and historical identities in Peru.
