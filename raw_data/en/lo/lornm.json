Actions required HSC Trusts are asked to take the following steps to support the treatment of patients in hospital with COVID -19 infection: 1. Organisations are recommended to consider prescribing an antiviral or monoclonal antibody treatment to adults, and children aged 12 and over and weighing at least 40kg, in line with the published policy . In the absence of a confirmed virological diagnosis, the treatment should only be used when a multidisciplinary team has a high level of confidence that the clinical and radiological features suggest that COVID -19 is the most likely diagnosis. 2. PF-07321332(nirmatrelvir) plus ritonavir (Paxlovid) , and molnupiravir, are not recommended during pregnancy. All individuals of childbearing potential who are prescribed molnupiravir should be advised to use effective contraception for the duration of treatment and for 4 days after the last dose of molnupir avir. The use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Patients using combined hormonal contraceptives should be advised to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception during treatment and until after one complete menstrual cycle after stopping Paxlovid. 3. All healthcare professionals are asked to ensure that any patients who receive a COVID antiviral while pregnant are reported to the UK COVID -19 antivirals in pregnancy registry on 0344 892 0909 . For more information, go to http://www.uktis.org/ 4. Clinicians are encouraged to proactively support recruitment into trials developing further evidence in the treatment of COVID -19. Patients admitted to hospital due to COVID who are ineligible for the casirivimab and imdevimab combination monoclonal antibody due to confirmed infection with the Omicron variant may be considered for entry into the RECOVERY trial, which is studying sotrovimab versus standard of care. 5. Organisations are encouraged to undertake anti -s spike antibody testing1 for all patients hospitalised due to COVID at, or as soon as possible after, the point of admission . Patients with hospital -onset COVID should also be antibody tested, with appropriate consent, to support further treatment evaluation and surveillance (antibody status does not affect treatment eligibility in this, second, cohort) . If there are concerns or questions around laboratory sensitivity or thresholds these should be discussed in the first instance with local laboratory leads who will have access to comparative and performance data from external quality assessment (EQA) scheme participation. Supporting laboratory networks should ensure that the maximum turnaround time for anti -s antibody tests is no greater than 24 hours from the sample being taken to the result being returned. Positive and negative antibody tests should be reported via the Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) , or equivalent systems in Northern Ireland, to support surveillance and enable reimbursement of associated assay costs . 6. Genotyping is a key element of the management of inpatients admitted due to COVID -19 infection. Where critical to a treatment decision, genotyping requests should be marked 'urgent - treatment is variant dependent' to assist laboratories in their priori tisation. Genotyping results should be reported via the Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) , or equivalent systems in Northern Ireland, to support surveillance and enable reimbursement of associated assay costs . 7. Noting the critical role of surveillance, treating clinicians are strongly encouraged to actively support additional testing or data requirements as requested under country specific or UK wide surveillance programmes, in line with further guidance to be is sued. 8. Discharge letters to primary care should explicitly record the treatment that has been given, together with the dose and date of administration. ___________________________________________________________ 1 Patients may be tested for anti -S1 or an ti-S2 antibodies using any validated quantitative or qualitative anti -S assay that measures either IgG or total antibody levels. Serostatus should be established in line with the pre -determined thresholds relevant to the assay being used by the testing lab oratory. Quantitative assays with pre -specified thresholds for seropositivity should return clear binary (i.e. either 'negative' or 'positive') results based on these thresholds. For quantitative assays without a formal threshold for serostatus, clinical d ecision -making should guide treatment decisions. 9. Any organisation treating patients admitted due to COVID -19 under this policy with the off-label 2.4g dose casirivimab and imdevimab antibody combination, or prescribing remdesivir to children aged 12 -17 years and not on supplementary oxygen, as off -label products, will be required to assure itself that the necessary internal governance arrangements have been completed before the medic ine is prescribed. These arrangements may be through the HSC Trust's drugs and therapeutics committee, or equivalent. 10. Adhere to the guidance which has been developed by the Specialist Pharmacy Service (SPS) to support the administration of antivirals and monoclonal antibodies . 11. HSC Trusts in North ern Ireland should liaise with the Regional Pharmaceutical Procurement Service to register interest in COVID -19 specific supply arrangements. Allocations for use within the HSC will be determined regionally, informed by nationally determined allocations, w ith ongoing supplies to each hospital replenished on the basis of relative use / need. Ongoing ordering will be through existing (business as usual) routes, supported by volume -based caps (reflecting estimated eligible admissions) where required. 12. Organisations should note that initial supply of COVID -19 medicines may be available within 'emergency supply' packaging, which differs from the planned Great Britain (GB) packaging / labelling aligned to the product's GB licence (or the equivalent product packaging / labelling aligned to a Regulation 174 author isation or European Medicines Agency marketing authorisation as applicable in Northern Ireland). To preserve available supply, providers must ensure that packs with shorter use by dates are used first . 13. Provide regular updates on the stock position to HSC Trust Heads of Pharmacy and Medicines Management, pharmacy procurement leads and the Regional Pharmaceutical Procurement Service. Hospitals should enter the product onto stock control and prescribing systems as described below: Casirivimab 300 mg per 2. 5 mL (120 mg/mL) with Imdevimab 300 mg per 2.5 mL (120 mg/mL) with the dose description as: 2 vial pack Casirivimab 1332 mg per 11.1 mL (120 mg/mL) with Imdevimab 1,332 mg per 11.1 mL (120 mg/mL) with the dose description as: 2 vial pack PF-07321332(nirm atrelvir) (150mg tablets) and ritonavir (100mg tablets), 30 tablet pack Remdesivir 100mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion Sotrovimab 500mg/8ml solution for infusion vials The Health and Social Care Board is asked to: 14. Continue to work with HSC Trusts and the Regional Pharmaceutical Procurement Service to monitor uptake of treatment, pending consideration for routine commissioning in line with extant Managed Entry arrangements. The previously published UK-wide interim clinical commissioning policy providing acces s to neutralising monoclonal antibodies (nMABs) and intravenous antivirals for hospitalised patients with COVID -19 infection has been further updated (effective from 10 February 2022) to add an additional antiviral treatment option - PF-07321332 (may also be known as nirmatrelvir) plus ritonavir (Paxlovid) as a first -line treatment option for patients with hospital onset COVID infection. The intravenous antiviral remdesivir (Veklury) a nd the monoclonal antibody sotrovimab (Xevudy) remain available as alternative treatment options in this cohort. Patients admitted due to COVID -19 continue to have a range of treatment options under published UK policies, but will only be able to routinel y access a monoclonal antibody treatment, casirivimab and imdevimab (Ronapreve), if genotyping confirms infection with a non -Omicron variant. Patients ineligible for the casirivimab and imdevimab combination may be considered for entry into the RECOVERY trial, which is studying sotrovimab versus standard of care. Genotyping of all inpatients continues to be recommended to assist in treatment decisions and / or to support wider surveillance. Summary Neutralising monoclonal antibodies (nMABs) bind to specific sites on the spike protein of the SARS -CoV-2 virus particle, blocking its entry into cells and therefore inhibiting its replication. Antiviral treatments inhibit the development and replication of viruses such as SARS -CoV-2. Recent evidence suggests that antivirals and nMABs significantly improve clinical outcomes in patients with COVID -19 who are at high risk of progression to severe disease and/or death. Group 1 Patients - There are no material changes in the policy for patients who have been admitted to hospital DUE to COVID -19. Patients hospitalised due to acute COVID -19 illness who are PCR positive with a non -Omicron variant and who are antibody seronegative may be treated at the off -label total dose of 2.4g of casirivimab and imdevimab. Clinicians are encouraged to consider entering all other patients admitted to hospital due to COVID -19 infection (including those infected with the Omicron variant, regardless of antibody status) into the RECOVERY trial, which is studying sotrovim ab versus standard of care. Please also refer to other published UK clinical access policies for treatment opti ons for patients admitted due to COVID -19 infection. The Public Health Agency is asked to: 15. Continue to work with HSC Trusts and the Business Services Organisation to report positive and negative tests to enable retrospective reimbursement of associated assay costs. Group 2 Patients - Options for patients admitted to hospital for a non -COVID -19 related reason but who nonetheless test positive during their hospital stay with and meeting additional eligibility criteria have been revised to provide access to an additional first -line treatment option - PF-07321332 (nirmatrelvir) plus ritonavir (Paxl ovid). Remdesivir (Veklury) licensed second -line treatment option. Sotrovimab (Xevudy) remains available as a third -line treatment option in this cohort. Further information to support clinical decision making for patients with hospital -onset COVI D-19 can be found in the supporting clinical guide . Further details on supporting evidence and eligibili ty, together with further guidance, can be found in the published policy Product Details Ronapreve is supplied to the UK by Roche. It is a combination neutralising monoclonal antibody (casirivimab plus imdevimab) used to inhibit viral replication in individuals who have not yet mounted an adequate antibody response to the SARS - COV -2 virus following eit her exposure or vaccination. The casirivimab plus imdevimab combination for intravenous and subcutaneous use is authorised for use in the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID -19 positive adults, and children aged 12 and above and weighing at least 40kg. Supp ly of the casirivimab and imdevimab combination is subject to the same requirements in both Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the product information in the Summary of Product Characteristics should be considered applicable across the UK. PF-073213 32(nirmatrelvir) plus ritonavir (Paxlovid) is a combination oral antiviral supplied by Pfizer that works by inhibiting a protease required for viral replication. It is supplied as a pack providing a five -day treatment course containing both PF - 07321332(nir matrelvir) ritonavir has a conditional market authorisation in Great Britain (under the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA)), and a Regulation 174 appro val covers use in Northern Ireland, for the treatment of COVID -19 in adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk for progression to severe COVID -19. Remdesivir (Veklury) is supplied by Gilead. Delivered intravenously, it h as a conditional market authorisation for use as a treatment for COVID -19 in both Great Britain (under the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA)) and in Northern Ireland (under the European Medicines Agency (EMA)) for 1) adults, and adolescents aged 12 and over weighing at least 40kg, with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen and 2) for adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID -19. Sotrovimab (Xevudy) is supplied b y GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology. Delivered intravenously, sotrovimab has a conditional marketing authorisation in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and in Europe (under the European Medicines Agency, covering Northern Ireland) for the tre atment of symptomatic adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and over and weighing at least 40 kg) with acute COVID - 19 infection who do not require oxygen supplementation and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID -19 infection. Prescribing The casirivimab plus imdevimab combination product (Ronapreve) is now authorised as a treatment for COVID -19 by the European Medicines Agency but the published policy includes an off -label use at a dose of 2.4g. The use of remdesivir for COVI D- 19 in adolescents aged 12 -17 years not yet requiring supplemental oxygen is also off - label. As such, clinicians prescribing either treatment should follow HSC T rust governance procedures in relation to the prescribing of off -label medicines. Further gui dance on the prescribing of off -label medicines interaction expected of the monoclonal antibodies or antiviral treatments covered under the policy with other treatments available for COVID under published UK clinical access policies - dexamethasone or hydrocortisone, remdesivir, or tocilizum ab or sarilumab. For further information please visit the University of Liverpool COVID -19 Drug Interactions website ( https://www.covid19 -druginteractions.org/checker ). Monoclonal antibod ies and / or antivirals should not be infused concomitantly in the same IV line with other medications. Monitoring, tracking and follow -up Monitoring of longer -term progress is strongly recommended via recruitment of patients receiving COVID therapies to the ISARIC -CCP study . All handovers of clinical care (including between hospitals if patients are transferred, between levels of care and clinical teams within hospitals, and between hospitals and primary care) should explicitly record that a monoclonal antibody has been given together with the dose and date of administration. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the United Kingdom Yellow Card Scheme www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard or sear ch for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store . Further enquiries should in the first instance be directed to your hospital pharmacy team.
