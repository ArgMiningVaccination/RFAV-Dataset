How can my path andanother's path toward freedom be harmonised whileremaining free? One common element in a community can be shared ideals. I experienced such a community at Emerson Collegein England, a centre for adults based on the work of RudolfSteiner, where I taught for twelve years. At no time did Ifeel there was one \"leader\" with a number of \"followers.\"We were colleagues, and there was always a space for initia-tive to come from anyone in the circle. None of us had asyllabus to follow or a program to carry out. Anything wedid came from our own imagination, inspiration or intu-ition, and we were responsible for it. At Emerson College, the student community changed every year (although not completely). The staff, togetherwith the students, was striving ever anew for a \"free\" run-ning of the College. This included day to day cleaning andmaintenance and also regular \"soul care\" and human con-tact between staff and students. A central feature of Collegelife was the cycle of yearly festivals which staff and stu-dents created together. All in all, it was the task in thiscommunity to meet together with heart and will, as well aswith understanding. One ideal was not to lose sight of theindividual in our concern for the community, especially asmany students went through significant life changes whileat the College. Already in 1924, Rudolf Steiner spoke of souls coming to earth in order to form \"voluntary communities ofMichael.\" Michael is pointing the human being to the sameplace where free spiritual deeds may be accomplished onearth. Have we not all come to participate in the free creat-ing and transforming of ourselves and earthly life? Areanthroposophical initiatives and institutions attracting andmeeting Michaelic spirits? Our anthroposophical groups,however modestly, have the possibility to be \"practicegrounds\" for the interchange of soul and spirit in an atmos-phere where freedom would be nurtured.

BristolForum Now we know! Anthroposophists can talk about their spiritual experienceswith each other. I had heard all kindsof things in years past. As recently asNovember 1998 Professor WolfgangSchad said to me, \"When you start totalk about your spiritual experiencesin anthroposophical circles, you getonly two kinds of reactions. Eitheryou are considered to be no longerquite sound of mind or people say,\"He seems to think he is RudolfSteiner.\" At that time Schad saw littlelikelihood of this working. Othershad similar experiences. In 1996 amember of the Executive Councillamented the lack of a forum in whichpeople could speak of their own spiri-tual experiences. Now, however, theclimate seems to be changing. Nodar Belkania and I offered a discussion group called \"Exchange ofSpiritual Experiences\" as our contribu-tion to the Michaelmas conference. Weplanned to restrict the group to 10participants because of the require-ment that every person speak. Yet evenwith about 16 participants the groupproved capable of working. We founda working modus very soon; indeed,some of the participants already hadexperience in leading such groups. Nothart Rohlfs was there, who had introduced me to this way ofworking; Philip Martyn, who was amember of the Council of theAnthroposophical Society in GreatBritain for many years, has London; Armin apharmacist from Pforzheim, repeatedly hisown approach to spiritual research.Two scientists from France (ChristineBallivet and Rodica-Liana Paxino, EdwinH\u00fcbner, Ernst Katz and others. The goal of such a group is not to discuss each other's research results.Everything depends on recoveringstates of knowing in such a way thatthe others can participate in them.You need to speak from the experi-ence in such a way that the listenerhimself has a kind of encounter withreality. Julija Dobrovolska, fromLatvia, helped us to do this for exam-ple, when she quite simply and with-out fanfare described the spiritualguidance that had led her to anthro-posophy in the Soviet Union. In such a community, people \"lend\" their spiritual organs - whichare as yet open only for particularexperiences - to each other. When thisprocess succeeds (joining the individ-uals to a larger organ) then a commu-nity arises that is similar to the con-nectedness of brothers and sisters. Away of knowing unfolds in this mutu-al sphere that is simultaneously love. You do not achieve this state as long as you are trying to pack whatthe other person is telling you intowhat you already know, that is, intoconcepts stored in memory. Anythingthat comes from memory shuts the One of many things I think we must concern ourselves with in the Anthro-posophical Society and thus also in anewsletter is to stress that no activitiesare \"more anthroposophical\" thanothers. I have been in this work since1952 when I first arrived at MichaelHall, England! Now I am a teacher atour kindergarten seminar here inCopenhagen, after many years of hav-ing been a Steiner kindergarten leader,and before that 15 years as a teacher ina State school! I have friends in bothgroups. A matter that has always struck me is the attitude that art done by anthro-posophists is \"better\" than other art!This is perhaps not intended, but some-how we must be aware of all the manyothers around the world - not that we should make African or Eastern artourselves - but we too easily talk aboutart as if only \"the German approach\" isthe right one! Sometimes it would bewonderful to read about people whohave an artistic approach to their work.We must not give the impression that ifpeople are not actively doing art theyare \"second-hand.\" I know many peo-ple who have an ordinary job, but whohave an artistic way of dealing with it -people who in their spare time go abouttheir gardening, reading or cooking,etc., in a wonderful, artistic way! Wemust not forget to see how artistic sci-entists actually are! Often creating newtheories out of nothing... Suzanne Brodersen, Denmark Exchanging Spiritual Experiences spiritual experience out. So does well-remembered anthroposophy. We succeeded in reaching a par- tially memory-free discourse quitesoon. This is not so surprising. Onceyou have some experience with livinganthroposophy you quickly notice (atleast after a few pointers) what memo-ry does and how memory-free experi-ence of knowledge works. People who had never spoken with each other before entered intoexact phenomenological conversationsabout their seemingly inexpressibleimpressions of folk spirits, doubledemons, falsely interpreted memoriesof incarnations, etc. There was neverenough time (six 75-minute sessionswere definitely too short). However,at the end we agreed on one outcomeof the Michaelmas Conference. It is possible to speak about spiritual expe-riences and to appraise and appropri-ate them together. Martin Barkhoff, Germany In Anthroposophy Worldwide no. 8/2000 Jan Bouzek drew attention to the fact that anthroposophy lives differently in different regions of the world. In the fol-lowing issue Traute Starke then wrote of the importance of perceiving each other.Here, Suzanne Brodersen reminds us of the need to value the artistic, creativework of everyone, whether or not they are anthroposophists. Our Activities Are Not \"Better\" than TheirsCorrections: Anthroposophy Worldwide no. 8/2000, page 3, 1st paragraph should read \"4times 12 people.\"Anthroposophy Worldwide no. 9/2000, page 9, first verse of poem, should read, \"Where a manin worlds / lived the Spirit of Man.\"3 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2000After visiting the National Museum and Tokyo Steiner School, our groupof overseas participants arrived at theconference centre in the dark and werereceived warmly by the organizingcommittee members and by those whohad come by train or car from as faraway as the northern island of Hokkai-do or the southern tip of Kagoshima.This conference was a memorableopportunity for Japanese and forfriends from Asia and the Pacificregion who were visiting Japan for thefirst time to meet each other. As Japan-ese we were not unaware of the experi-ence and the feeling of our neighboursthrough the conflicts in the recent his-tory of Asia. For many Asian peopleJapan was something of an enigma. In quiet anticipation, the confer- ence began. Yuko Okada, a Japanesefrom California, chaired a sun-ny smile. Tomie Ando, who resides inthe United Kingdom, recited thefoundation stone meditation in Japan-ese and English against the noise ofthe rain, which was pounding on thetin roof of the building. Hiroko Obarecited the Michael Imagination. Formany of us it was the first time tohear these powerful words in Japan-ese, but I felt the strong presence ofspirit in the words. It gave substanceto our time together. Although the centre was located in the foothills of Mt. Fuji, we sawnothing of it for the first days, as thepassing typhoon changed its directionand brought heavy rainfall. We wereconfined in the main hall most of theday, but this was a blessing for it gaveus plenty of time to be together and toget to know each other. I found an oldfriend, Denis Pillaud - a French bio-dynamic farmer who had been inJapan for nearly 20 years. I was alsoreunited with new friends whom I hadcome to know during the first part ofmy trip. Sachiko Yamasaki, for exam-ple, an active member of the organis-ing committee, had met me at Kansaiairport at the beginning of my trip 3weeks earlier. I met Hiroko Nakashima and Masami Kanda, whowere part of the translation team thathad the brilliant idea of raising fundsby translating and selling a booklet,Waldorf Education, Questions andAnswers by Alan Howard. They were successful in raising funds to helpoverseas participants come to Japan.Reiko Shimada, by then a familiar faceand voice, introduced me to MasashiSatoh and Yoshihiro Kondo, who hadbrought this conference to Japan in thefirst place. The three of them hadworked hard during the past twoyears, supported by many others. The theme of the conference was \"The Mystery of Freedom.\"As speakers from the East and Westaddressed the theme from a differ-ent angle each day, the complex andmysterious nature of freedomemerged. Alongside the maintheme, Yuji Agematsu, the of the Anthroposophical Soci-ety in Japan, showed the parallelprocess of the development of con-sciousness in the West and in Japan,which he has researched. BenjaminCherry, who has lived and travelledextensively in Asia, further developedthe theme with the reference to Zenand his study of The Philosophy of Freedom . In so doing he made clear the link between freedom and love. Another Japanese speaker, Ryuhan Nishikawa, a Buddhist monk andanthroposophist, spoke of ego con-sciousness and its connection to free-dom from the Eastern religious andphilosophical perspective. In anthro-posophy he sees an integration of theEastern and the Western mysterystreams. Terry Boardman, an English-man who lived in Japan and knows itintimately, examined the concept offreedom which is spread throughouttoday's world. It first took root in theEnglish folk soul and was developedfrom the 17th century onwards,becoming the basic value of materialismin Western civilisation. He asked if it is Creating a Vessel with Willing Hearts Impressions from the 5th Anthroposophical Asia Pacific Conference, November 2-5, 2000 in JapanAnthroposophy around the World When Fumiko Chikami heard about the first Asia Pacific Conference in the Philip-pines a few years ago, she would have liked to attend. Two years ago she learnedthat a conference was planned in Thailand, and again, she very much wanted to bethere. This autumn, finally, she was able to participate in the 5th Asia-Pacific Con-ference held at the foot of Mt. Fuji in Japan, her country of origin. This was the first Michaelmas Conference in Japan and the concluding event of the Michaelmas conferences 2000. It was the first international confer-ence which brought together over 60 participants from 20 countries and morethan 120 new and old students of anthroposophy from all over Japan. Employeesin Japan have only 10 days vacation a year, which some participants used toattend this conference and the roundtable on Waldorf education which followedit (see box on the next page). not time to consider the freedom of the folk spirit and he pointed out a com-mon task facing Japan and the UnitedKingdom - to overcome our insularityand create a freer relationship with thecontinent as well as with America. Nicanor Perlas from the Philip- pines touched on the relationshipbetween freedom and the threefoldsocial order. He showed how ourthreefold social initiative could bal-ance the opposite stream of material-ism of our present-day world. Masao Naka, who works in the field of cura- tive education in Germany and Japan,approached the theme of freedom bysharing his experience with motherswhose children had been born withmultiple difficulties. He witnessed, inthe mothers' despair and struggle, aprocess of transformation that ledthem to light and freedom. Rolf Kerler, who is treasurer at the Goetheanum, introduced the relation-ship between money and freedom. Hepointed explicitly to where moneytouches freedom - in the deed of giv-ing. By giving or investing money inthe development of others, we liberateourselves from the boundary of ego-ism. Lastly, Paul Mackay, also from theGoetheanum, spoke of freedom in theAnthroposophical Society, referring tothree archetypal dramas in our souls inthe context of our time. It is the des-tiny of our time and we all go throughthis process of transformation to reach Photos: Toshio TakahashiThe conference venue Yama no mura4 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2000our full humanity. As a member of the Anthroposophical Society, whetherfrom the East or from the West, we cango through this process consciouslywhen we choose to be active in thedevelopment of our soul forces out ofour own free will. This is a task of ourtime. The content of the lectures was rich and deep. Equally rich were thesmall group sessions we undertookbetween lectures. The programmeincluded eurythmy, watercolourpainting, religion, biodynamic farm-ing, spatial dynamics, the Japanese artof knot tying, education, social prob-lems, ethical individualism, biographywork, and Article 9 on peace in theJapanese constitution in connectionwith the Philosophy of Freedom . The evening was the time for cul- tural exchange. A piece of nature wascreated in the hall in the art of Ike-bana by the experienced hands ofYuriko J. Omata, and a Buddhist'sprayer by Christlieb Yuho Jobstaccompanied the ancient art of tea cer-emony by Yuriko. The elegant danc-ing and the joyous singing by Asianfriends touched my heart and broughtup the old question, \"Why destroysuch beauty?\" with the military pow-er in the past and with the economicpower at present. As the days went by, the space and the time were filled with warmthand joy - through being together andsharing the thoughts and experiencesthat each of us brought from a differ-ent part of the world - not only fromAsia and the Pacific region but alsofrom Europe. Towards the end of theconference, we were able to see Mt.Fuji against the clear blue autumn sky,very near, just above the bright redand yellow leaves of the surroundingwoods. After such a time together, ourparting from friends was not easy. I brought home many precious memories of special moments that Iexperienced at various points of theconference. The most unforgettable ofall is the selfless service and commit-ment that the large group of staff hadgiven to support the conference. Intheir giving gesture, I felt the beauty ofthe human spirit expressed fully ingiving so willingly and conscientious-ly. The foundation stone meditationsounded clear each day in the vesselthus created by so many willing hearts. In our meeting and working to- gether, I found something of theanswer to the question I had beencarrying within me for some time.How can anthroposophy, which wasborn in the West in its historicalprocess of evolution, live in the East?Through common spiritual endeavourwe can reach the same deep rootwhich knows no boundaries. Fumiko Chikami, Great BritainOne question that concerns all of us is the protection of the labels\"Waldorf\" and \"Rudolf Steiner.\"Nowhere else is the inclination sogreat to seize and market anupcoming fashion. We can alreadyrecognize the signs. Looking to ourown work, we are concerned withthe criteria for quality that a schoolor kindergarten must fulfill to justi-fy the name \"Waldorf school.\" Wewill need to continue working withthis question and with ensuringquality. This year we concentrated on the first three years of school. HelenCock from the Waldorf trainingseminar in Melbourne, Australia andTine Bruinsma from the SlokaSchool in Hyderabad, India intro-duced our discussions. Through hercolorful report of the school inHyderabad (a school which has chil-dren from seven religions and thir-teen mother tongues) and through \"Modern society is subject to increas- ingly rapid change. Cultural and socialopposites will clash dramatically, call-ing for a high degree of humanity.Only education which has roots in thehuman being's deepest needs andwhich has a view to future develop-ments can produce children and youngpeople who can face these challengeswith courage, love and new ideas.\"Thus did the exhibit brochure formu-late the current task of education. With their program of work- shops, student performances, classesat work, eurythmy demonstrationsand much else, the Waldorf childrenand adults created a very specialmood, a fruitful social environment.The students showed their activities ina very open and hearty way; they didnot let the audience bother them. Tothe contrary - the audience was drawn in! The exhibit elicited a positiveresponse. Several television stationsreported on it during prime time. Interest in early childhood educa- tion has been very great over theyears. Waldorf early childhood educa-tion is known to very many educatorsin the country thanks to the kinder-garten teacher-training seminar. Manyeducational impulses have certainlybeen taken up in many places. About2000 people have taken these courses. The training center Audonicon has been having financial problems forsome time now, so the Steiner schoolshave taken responsibility for trainingteachers there. Students who take thecourses are eligible for governmentfunds. Marianne M\u00f8ller-Nielsen, Denmarkcontributions from the teachers of the Tokyo Rudolf Steiner School, wegained vivid insight into how totallydifferent conditions for educationare in Southeast and East Asia, com-pared with Europe. Central to ourdiscussion was the view of thehuman I in East Asian cultures. What exactly is the task of edu- cation in a country whose languagealways mentions the I in its relationto its natural or human surround-ings? In Vietnamese for example,there are more than thirty ways ofsaying \"I.\" This is a field of researchthat must be taken up in view of thegrowing Waldorf movement. It has adirect influence on the educationalgoals of Asian Waldorf schools. The meeting brought great joy to all of us, strengthening the feelingof solidarity in this still quite youngkindergarten and Waldorf schoolmovement. Nana G\u00f6bel, Germany To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Waldorf education in Denmark, an exhibit was staged in Copenhagen, \"We Don't Repeat Childhood.\" The publicwas treated to a live parallel program of workshops, student performances, classdemonstrations and much more, attended by a total of 5500 people. FourteenDanish schools accepted responsibility for the costs (also providing 150 krones perstudent), to secure the budget of 800,000 krones.The fourth roundtable discussion on Waldorf education in Asia was held November 6-7, 2000 in Japan. Representatives of Waldorf schools and kinder-gartens from China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Taiwan,Thailand and Vietnam gathered to discuss current developments and problems.Thorough reports from each country dealt with both the general political situa-tion for education and with the special needs of Waldorf initiatives. We Don't Repeat Childhood 50 Years Waldorf Education in DenmarkThe Human I in East Asian Cultures Waldorf Roundtable Discussion in Asia Denmark5 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2000A child is quite simply a child. It is a being with its very own world and thisworld cannot be streamlined into con-formity with any other world. We canobserve this best when children play(when they are still allowed to play!).In play the child develops its indepen-dent being. This is similar across theworld, even if children's toys differ. Play as a human right? Precisely! Incidentally, O. Fred Don-aldson, the \"Play Man,\" stressed thismost emphatically. Children want toplay. That is their cosmopolitan trait.The universal human reveals itself inplay; the child reveals what it means tobe human. This is why we as grownupscan learn so much from children. Per-haps they carry more humanness with-in them, which we grownups need toseek. That is why Donaldson says,\"Something sacred occurs in play.\" Do children of industrialized societies tend to be more disadvantaged in thisrespect?You could say so. In the West, adultsarrange to keep children occupied andamused. But play is something funda-mentally different. At the conferenceit was important to see how a generalunderstanding of this basic humanelement is growing among profession-als in the field. Many words have been spoken. But did a mutual project arise? A strategy?Initially we had the deep conviction thatwe must do something. Themes such as violence, the media and computers arevery high on our agenda. We hadplanned an initial summary of ideas andviewpoints for the last day of the confer-ence, but we could not manage it any-more because of the many viewpointsthat fortunately found space. I am think-ing of a kind of \"Declaration of Brus-sels\" that would be publicized later. What impressed you most? Much! Very much! Perhaps it was theexperience of how dedicated people from the most diverse backgroundsfound each other at the conference. Iwas deeply touched by what connect-ed people so closely who did notknow each other before. Connectedthem immediately. The quiet restraintthat can accompany the question, \"Ishe or she an anthroposophist or...?\"disappeared from the first momentonwards. We were quite simply peo-ple gathered around the idea of thechild. This is what determines thespiritual quality of a task - notwhether everyone belongs to the Wal-dorf school movement. Perhaps indi-vidual new initiatives will arise fromthese encounters. Such as? We have had initial discussions to-wards starting some kind of collabora-tion between Belgium and the Nether-lands regarding the small child. Orinformation networks on certainthemes such as the media and comput-ers. Also, there were positive reactionsin Flemish newspapers. This mightmake it possible to discuss the themeof computers in Belgian education in aless prejudiced way. The newspaperarticles have awakened interest. And how will you go on from here? The Alliance will document the entireconference. We already have an agree-ment with Hawthorn Press (GreatBritain). But this is only a first step.Children need strong initiativesworldwide. The Alliance would liketo provide a framework for such ini-tiatives. But a network depends on thepeople who use it and enliven it! An appeal, therefore? Definitely. Interview by Christine Gruwez, who also trans- lated it from the Flemish into German. Thistranslation is based on the 44.Who is the Alliance for Childhood? That is not easy to answer! Anyonewho shares our concern about theright to childhood and who wants todo something about it can join theAlliance. Important is a total readinessto cross boundaries. Why was the conference held in Brussels?Because of \" Witte Mars ,\" the day on which more than 300,000 peopledemonstrated in Brussels, after they hadheard about a terrible crime against chil-dren in Belgium. One reason many ofthem protested was because the pictureof childhood itself had been violated. But isn't Brussels a center in Europe? It is in the sense that many Europeaninstitutions are seated in Brussels. Forme, a European center would havebroader dimensions. What doesEurope mean with regard to the rightto childhood? What could be the spe-cific contribution of Europe? Andwhat could the idea of childhood (inits deepest sense) contribute to anauthentic Europe? Was the conference noticed worldwide? Yes. Participants came from Russia,Brazil, Japan, South Africa, NewZealand, the U.S.A. and the Philip-pines. However, most were fromWestern Europe. Isn't it difficult to agree on these mat- ters? Isn't the situation of a child in\"wealthy\" Belgium totally differentfrom the situation of a child in apoverty-stricken ghetto somewhere inSouth America?Although their living conditions aretotally different, the surprising thing isthat the essential question remains oneand the same: Are we capable ofresponding to the child as anautonomous being? A child is not asmall grown-up or - worse - a con-sumer to target or something one canown. The child belongs only to itself.Something Sacred Occurs in Play International Alliance for Childhood Conference , 11-14 October 2000 in Brussels It is relatively new in the history of humanity that a differen-tiation is made between childhood and adulthood. The childhas not always been perceived as a being in its own right,having its own needs. Until the 17th or 18thcenturies the child was considered a \"not yet.\" However, even now in the 21st century, the rights of the child have not reached fullconsciousness. Even in regions where childrenare more protected and cared for, they are sub-ject to the dangers of the electronic media, thehectic of traffic, and teaching methods unsuitedto children, in which too little and too much isdemanded of them simultaneously. Anotherthreat is sexual abuse - throughout all segmentsof society.Hundreds of dedicated parents, teachers, youth coun- selors, child psychologists, educators and jurists fromaround the world met for the conference, \"Rights to chil- dren - a bridge for the future.\" Alliance forChildhood arranged the conference with sup-port from the Waldorf School Association, theInternational Association of Waldorf Kinder-gartens, and others. The kindergarten teacherKlaar Aarts (of the initiative group in Bel-gium) and the Rudolf Steiner Academy(Antwerp, Belgium) helped with the organiza-tion. Christine Gruwez spoke with HansArnoot, who works at the Rudolf SteinerAcademy and in the Federation of SteinerSchools in Belgium.

The steep slopes ofthe planted terraces are secured withelephant grass (cattle feed) and lemon-grass (used to make a delicious tea).The boundaries between the neigh-bors' plots are formed by fast-grow-ing hedges, which provide feed for thedairy goats and a basis for nutritive,nitrogenous liquid fertilizer.

Every group of farmers receives advice on organic farming from anagricultural engineer once a week for18 months.

All profitsgo into a group fund from which theothers can then purchase tanks anddairy goats. The farmers repeatedly expressed their thankfulness to the people whoare helping them through donationsand with knowledge of organic farm-ing, which has given them newprospects. The expression on the faces of these people, which radiates meaning,self awareness and joy in the hard butsuccessful work, makes a strongimpression on me, leaving me with theunspoken question, \"Would I havesuch trust in life, such strength, secures stability.

Priore announced that he wouldinclude the content of the DornachLandscape Document in the continuing work on the Landscape Convention. Interest has not ebbed. Since the conference, the Science Section hasbeen responding to a constant streamof inquiries, for example from Ger-man universities and associations.There have also been regular discus-sions with officials in the Council ofEurope.

The conference theme, \"The Cul- ture of the European Landscape as aTask,\" might seem rather introspectiveat first. Yet the General Secretary ofthe Council of Europe, Waltered initiatives devoted to threefolding - Network Threefolding (Stuttgart)and International Cultural Center inAchberg, whose EuroVision initiativelobbied for the inclusion of civil soci-ety. The two initiatives have sent outa call for action to all civil society ini-tiatives. In addition, various NGOs col- laborated to discuss ways of securingfundamental freedom in education.National and international Waldorfassociations were among them. Thismust have been the first time thatorganizations spanning such diverse worldviews collaborated on a Euro-pean level.

BueroStrawe@t-online.deEurope Anthroposophical Society GENERAL ANTHROPOSOPHICAL SOCIETY Changes in the Executive Council Enlargement and Retirement After consultation with the Collegium of the School of Spiritual Science and ameeting with the General Secretaries,the Executive Council would like tolet you know that we have decided toinvite three individuals to join us inour work on the Executive Council: Cornelius Pietzner , 43 years old, from Philadelphia, U.S.A. He devel-oped a Camphill home for the handi-capped there (Soltane). He was presi-dent of the Camphill AssociationNorth America and is a member ofthe Council of the AnthroposophicalSociety in America. Bodo von Plato , 42 years old, from Heidelberg, Germany. At onetime a Waldorf teacher in France,now back in Germany for manyyears, he has been researching the his-tory of time and consciousness in the20th century. He manages a researchcenter, Kulturimpuls, which he will continue to do. Sergej Prokofieff , 46 years old, originally from Russia, co-founder ofthe Anthroposophical Society in Rus-sia. He is known as the author ofmany books and as a lecturer. Oneemphasis of his work is the inner sub-stantiation of the General Anthropo-sophical Society. Sergej Prokofieff willbring an Eastern European back-ground to the Executive Council,which has been lacking until now. Only afterwards did we realize that with these three personalities wehad gained one person from the Euro-pean East, one from the Center, andone from the West. We are aware that it would be appropriate to improve the parity ofmen and women on our Council. Wehope that this can happen later.

Withinthis contradiction lies the livingthought of love for the world, for theenvironment. Out of this love risesthe question: What does the worldlack? What does the world need? At the Goetheanum we ask our- selves such questions. What are thetasks of the Goetheanum in the lightof the necessities of our time? Whatdoes it mean in practice for theGoetheanum to become a heartorgan, a perceptive organ for impor-tant occurrences in the world, and torender what is needed? Many personal remarks during and after the Michaelmas Confer-ence 2000 confirmed how import-ant such a heart organ is. And it is ofthe same importance to do what ispossible in an every-day practicalway so that this heart organ canwork in a healthy manner, on aninternational level and with universalhuman perspectives. There are many concrete tasks through which the Goetheanum canbecome even more such a heartorgan. I would like to name threetasks which lie ahead of us andwhich reinforce the gesture going outfrom the Goetheanum - for others. 1. One thousand members from 46 countries around the worldattended the Michaelmas Confer-ence. Many of them were not able tofinance their travel costs and soreceived a contribution from theGoetheanum. The number of partic-ipants who need financial help toattend section conferences has alsobeen growing and will increase fur-ther. This is why we want to estab-lish an international travel fund fromwhich we can support meetings andcollaboration. The Michaelmas Conference also showed how important it is, inview of the international work of theAnthroposophical Society, that par-ticipants can follow the meetings in alanguage that they are familiar with.We provided every participant withearphones for simultaneous transla-tion. Most of those earphones had tobe rented, however. Our wish wouldbe to augment our equipment withfurther earphones and interpretercubicles, so that the Goetheanumwould have access to its own basicconference equipment. 2. Apart from the Michaelmas Conference, quite a number of inter-national conferences took place dur-ing this year with the followingthemes: Doing Anthroposophy; TheCulture of the European Landscapeas a Task; The Esoteric inthe World Religions; TransformativeArchitecture; Spirituality in the Careof Patients; Impulses for Renewal inBiodynamic Farming and more.Over 5000 friends attended theseconferences. Many of them receivedfinancial support from the Goethe-anum. Unfortunately, conferencefees do not come close to coveringthe costs incurred by the Goethe-anum, but the work is fruitful and itreaches into the future. 3. The work of the sections of the School of Spiritual Science isbecoming more and more our main emphasis among the tasks linkingthe Goetheanum with the world.Development projects emanatingfrom the set tasks and from theneeds of our time can only be tack-led in an effective way and workedat together with the institutionsaround the world if we have an ade-quate organisation with active co-workers available at the basis. Thenecessary reinforcement with regardto personnel in several Sections (Sec-tion for the Spiritual Striving ofYouth; Section for the Arts of Eury-thmy, Speech, Drama and Music;Section for the Literary Arts andHumanities) requires substantialfinancial means. With these things in mind we send out an appeal for help to all mem-bers, asking: Do you see a possibilityof supporting the Goetheanum sothat we may go into the new yearwith much courage and increasedstrength? We thank you cordially and in advance for your Christmas dona-tion and we wish you a peaceful andcontemplative festive season. With sincere greetings, YoursRolf Kerler 8 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2000The three people named here have accepted their nominations. SergejProkoffief and Bodo von Plato willbegin at Easter 2001, and CorneliusPietzner at Easter 2002. The next step isto ask the coming two Annual GeneralMeetings to agree to this. One reason for this enlargement of the Executive Council is the factthat two members will retire withintwo to three years: Rolf Kerler has decided to place the work of treasurer into youngerhands (Cornelius Pietzner has been asked to take this on) and leave theExecutive Council within two years.He will continue with the task ofseeking financing for the Goetheanumin an international context, particular-ly with the help of the Evidence Soci-ety and in collaboration with founda-tions and trusts, etc. Heinz Zimmermann would like to withdraw from the daily responsi-bilities of working on the ExecutiveCouncil within two to three years, sothat he can devote himself to the gen- eral anthroposophical training ofyounger people at the Goetheanum(foundation year, independent studies,advanced courses, etc.). Rolf Kerler and Heinz Zimmer- mann will thus remain connected withthe Goetheanum. The Executive Council at the Goetheanum Manfred Sease, Heinz Zimmermann, Rolf Kerler, Paul Mackay \"The gift he receives in the higher regions of the supersensible world is nothing that comes to him, but only something thatflows from him, that is, love for the world and for others.\"Rudolf Steiner: Knowledge of the Higher WorldsChristmas Appeal 9 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2000There is no question that Dornach is currently the seat of the sections andof the General AnthroposophicalSociety. So our main task is to createand maintain networks and workopportunities. We must not imaginethat this is being done here only. Thespecial thing about Dornach, however,is its world-encompassing orientation. Another area concerns the build- ings on the Goetheanum grounds. Ifwe do not take certain measures tomaintain them now, we will leave aconsiderable burden to coming gener-ations. We are obligated to preservethese buildings for coming genera-tions. Another task would be to makeRudolf Steiner's artistic estate accessi-ble to the anthroposophical movementand to the public in an adequate form. And the Goetheanum stage? Our stage is unique from the point ofview of its history and dimensions.One question is whether the Goethe-anum might increasingly become aplace where artists from around theworld can gather to realize specificprojects. However, when we considerFaust , Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dra- mas and other productions, there aremany good reasons for continuing tomaintain a permanent core group ofartists here. Incidentally, our mainauditorium is becoming known for itsacoustics - musicians value it as a placeto give concerts. How we finance our next speech, eurythmy and music projects willdepend on the artistic impulses thatarise. I could imagine handling a futureproduction of Faust in a similar way to the renovation of the auditorium. Thiswould mean that we would have a community of artists that car-ries out a project that is support-ed by our movement. Thiswould be my personal ideal. What are the qualities of the ideal treasurer?The essential thing is a capacityfor perception, including inter-national relations. Certainly wehave major financial tasks herein Dornach, but also in manyother places. So our responsibil- ity is international. The treasur-er should build bridges, bridgesbetween banks, foundations, national societies, private donors,members, institutions and the Goethe-anum. He also needs to build bridgeswithin the Goetheanum. Here thetreasurer needs to ensure that clarityreigns between all concerned and thatbudget agreements are being met. In this respect our collaboration is very good at the moment. Our finan-cial consciousness has increased con-siderably. We make clear agreementsand if we cannot meet them we dis-cuss this well in advance. This isworking well. Our building budget,for example, is met 100% (in contrastto what used to happen). We hope tobe able to contribute something to thedevelopment of the Society throughour financial efforts and the questionsthat arise from them. One main source of income comes from members' contributions. Whatcan we do there?The national societies have let usknow that we cannot expect risingcontributions. We must accept thatthis area is stagnating. So if we workwell, at best the members' contribu-tions will not fall. It would be very important to launch a membership campaign fromthe Goetheanum. The Executive Coun-cil should start an initiative regardingthe question of future membership. Wecould learn from the U.S. society, forexample. In the U.S. Council, new ideasfor cultivating membership have a highpriority. I expect the number of mem-bers in the U.S. to overtake the numberin the Netherlands and Switzerland. Wemust definitely invest time and effort inthis whole area.Our \"Product,\" the Supersensible Human Being Interview with Markus Jermann, Manager of Finances at the Goetheanum The Goetheanum's finances currently thrive on a fortunatesymbiosis. While Rolf Kerler, the treasurer, is responsible forthe finances of the General Anthroposophical Society andhas been concerning himself primarily with supra-regionalfinancial questions since summer 2000, Markus Jermannmanages the finances of the Goetheanum itself. This taskencompasses accounting, bookkeeping, controlling, contactwith the various departments and sections (regarding finances), contributions from members and institutions, andthe administration of donations. Jermann is also active inlocal government and for some time he helped organize andchair the monthly co-worker meetings at the Goetheanum.When we became aware of some of his innovative ideas wedecided to ask about his views on the Goetheanum finances. There is currently much talk of the service sector and also of theGoetheanum as a service pro-vider. Will we be able to describethe Goetheanum as a serviceprovider in the future?The Goetheanum already is aservice provider. It is a meetingvenue for the worldwide mem-bership and for professionalgroups. A substantial part of thecosts of these meetings is carriedby the Goetheanum budget.Another example is the archive.Thanks to the work of UweWerner we have achieved a highlevel of service there. Now wecan more easily justify charging fees.We have different fees for membersand non-members. Incidentally, theTrustees of Rudolf Steiner's Estatehave adopted our rate structure. Thisis an example of how the professional-ization of our services can lead totransparency and cost-coverage in thebudget. Does this also apply to the sections? We have recently taken steps in thisdirection with three sections - thepedagogical, medical, and science sec-tions. These three sections no longerprimarily assert the right to have theGoetheanum cover their costs. Insteadwe speak of specific projects and ser-vices. We calculate costs accordinglyand seek ways of financing them withother partners. This has caused achange in attitude that has alreadyborn fruit. We have succeeded inobtaining more help from foundationsand elsewhere for specific projects. Ofcourse we continue to guarantee a cer-tain sum to cover the basic costs ofthe sections. More difficult to approach in this way is the work of the Section forMathematics and Astronomy, forexample, or the Art Section and Liter-ary Arts Section. Yet there, too, weare seeking new approaches. This whole effort is very impor- tant because we have set ourselves thegoal of meeting our regular expenseswithout using donations or legaciesby the year 2002. Which services can best be offered in Dornach and which services are betteroffered elsewhere? \"I could imagine handling a future production of Faust in a similar way to the renovation of the auditorium.\"10 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2000What else can we learn from the national societies?How they work. Many national soci-eties are gaining in importance becausethey are expanding and strengtheningtheir work. The Goetheanum is notreceiving less contribution moneybecause the national societies are\"bad\" but because any payments to usstand next to activities within thecountries themselves. This applies alsoto the regional section work. It is very important that we do not see each other as rivals fighting forlimited resources. We are partnersbecause we are working together onthe same tasks. This calls for a highdegree of cooperation from all of us.It is also becoming obvious that ourtreasurers can no longer solve theirproblems alone, they require partnersin banking, foundations, business, etc. How would you describe members' contributions as a quality?Contributions constitute the financialpillar of the idea of the Anthropo-sophical Society's ability to incarnate.Contributions are an advance demon-stration of trust in those who thenwork with the funds on behalf of theSociety. This is a very sensitive, livingsocial structure. It is a fundamentalquestion of trust in the idea of theGoetheanum, independent of whetheryou happen to like the people current-ly working there. The Goetheanum isa picture for an idea. We do not knowhow this idea will unfold in thefuture. I sometimes do not agree with the leadership or with other peoplehere at all, but that has nothing to dowith whether I give my contributionor not. This is true for any associa-tion. You contribute something basicto an idea. This money serves tosecure the idea's basic existence anddevelopment. So it is not merely a matter of providing services?No. This is even clearer with regard tocontributions from institutions. Docontributions from institutions implya claim on the sections, which shouldthen provide something in return andbe able to compete on the free mar-ket? Take addiction counseling, forexample. Does the Social Science Sec-tion have a better concept than otheraddiction approaches? Or do institu-tions contribute because they are pri-marily concerned with staying in con-tact with the Goetheanum, with con-tributing to its fruitfulness? - Doesthe Goetheanum have anything fruit-ful to offer? There are several institutions that provide us with contributions that arenot tied to results. They are pioneers!However, since there are many moreinstitutions that think differently, theGoetheanum must ask itself - why dothey contribute nothing? When asked,they say that they have never had anyreal contact with the Goetheanum.The section work means nothing tothem. People in Dornach live in an Nikolai Fuchs to Take Over from Manfred KlettSOCIAL SCIENCE SECTION Paul Mackay Now LeaderManfred Klett will retire from the leadership of theAgriculture Department ofthe Science Section in sum-mer 2001 when he has com-pleted his 68th year, hand-ing the task to NikolaiFuchs. The agriculturalmovement and the ScienceSection are connected likeSiamese twins, Rudolf Stein-er once said, so it was logical that atwo-fold section leadership evolved,having grown since the 1970s fromthe actual circumstances in bothfields. Nikolai Fuchs will thus workclosely with Johannes K\u00fchl as anindependent section leader for theconcerns of agriculture. Nikolai Fuchs, born 1963 in Kor- bach, Germany, studied agriculture inBonn after doing an apprenticeship in agri-culture. He then man-aged a conservation pro-ject, became a biody-namic advisor, becamethe manager of the Bio-dynamic Working Com-munity of North Rhine-Westphalia and finallythe manager of the Research Ring for Ways of DoingBusiness in Biodynamic Agriculture(in Darmstadt, Germany). During atransition period Nikolai Fuchs willhave to continue with his responsibili-ties in the Research Ring. ManfredKlett will continue to serve the biody-namic movement where he is askedand as strength allows. Manfred Klett, Johannes K\u00fchlOn 19 November, during the annual fall meeting, the leadership of theSocial Science Section passed fromManfred Schmidt-Brabant to PaulMackay. In his inaugural addressPaul Mackay gave an outline of thework of the section. It involvesresearching relationships betweenpeople. We need to understand andform our relationships in a differen-tiated way. In cultural life we act asbeings with capacities; in the sphereof rights, as eligible adults; in eco-nomic life, as beings with needs.

S.J.abstract framework. They do not understand the needs of entrepre-neurs, etc. - Are we prepared to listento this and change something? Are you going to develop a new fundraising idea?Many dream of fundraising becausethey think it will solve their financialproblems. This is a very short-termview, however - at least for us. Weneed to ask, What is our \"product,\"what do we have to offer? What is theGoetheanum's \"product\" or anthro-posophy's \"product,\" apart from ser-vices we can name? Can we speak of aproduct at all? This is difficult to answer because our \"product\" is in constant develop-ment. And what is development? Whatis development in a student, a teacheror a school? How can we portray it?We can arrive at the realization that ouractual \"product\" is the supersensiblehuman being; we encourage people towork on their relationships to theirsurroundings and themselves, to theirouter and their inner worlds. Thissparks processes of development. Is this a marketable product? However, there is an aspect offundraising that we can use - commu-nication. Do we have clean, transpar-ent and ongoing relationships withour donors, members and friends?This is something we are specificallyaddressing, in all areas of financing. Falk Zientz spoke with Markus Jermann in September 2000. School of Spiritual Science SCIENCE SECTION , AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT Photo supplied by Die Drei11 Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2000always rises up when you try to negate it. In addition, I think that many peo-ple feel that a huge gulf yawns betweenpresent-day technological prowess andour ability to actually fathom thenature and depth of life. Technologymay march on, but that doesn't meanwe know what we're doing - that is anunsettling perception. How will cloning change our picture of the human being?In biology today nature is seen as aset of mechanisms that should beunderstood and can be manipulatedto our advantage. The human being isnot an exception. We are the conse-quence of the same biological mecha-nisms that have brought forth all oth-er forms of life. Why should we betreated differently? Scientists areinconsistent if they make the humanbeing an exception. This inconsisten-cy stems from strong, but \"unscientif-ic\" sentiments that most of us stillhave. But the more society gets usedto manipulation - the more cloning ofanimals succeeds and can be por-trayed as \"humane\" - the less inhibi-tion people will have about humancloning. One scientist stated a coupleof years ago that if we would educatepeople better, there would be lessCraig Holdrege has taught biology in Waldorf schools for 20 yearsand is also active in teacher train-ing. He has been the director ofthe Nature Institute in Ghent,New York since 1998. The NatureInstitute aims to reach a wide pub-lic, particularly via publicationsand by drawing attention to thewealth of true phenomena.public resistance to human genetic manipulation. 1Implicitly he's saying that the more we educate people to begood materialists, the easier it will befor them to believe that purely mate-rialistic manipulations are the answerto problems. But shouldn't we welcome the ability to heal disease?When scientists need the best possiblejustification for their actions, they say:this technique will heal disease or savepeople from starvation. How couldanyone possibly be against that? I'msure many scientists have altruisticmotives mixed in with all their otherreasons and desires. But the real prob-lem is that such general justificationsare exceedingly abstract and have as arule very little connection to the actu-al problem at hand. 2Genetic tech- niques will continue to be developedthat bring advances in medical treat-ment. But we need to be aware thatevery mere technical advance entails atthe same time, from a spiritual per-spective, a step backwards. Why?Because technology allows us to avoidcertain challenges. We gain somethingbut we lose something as well. Themore a machine or technique takes theplace of the interaction betweenpatient and doctor, the less of a heal-ing, therapeutic relation can be estab-lished between patient and doctor.Healing is always something individ-ual and concrete that involves anunpredictable process and outcome. Itmust be lived through. Proponents ofgenetic technologies would have usbelieve that genetic manipulations willbe able to provide automatic healing(which is described as \"repair ofdefects\"). But that's an illusion. What alternative can anthroposophy offer to genetic engineering?Through the study of anthroposophyand meditative practice, we can changethe way we think, feel, and act as indi-viduals. That's what is essential, not thatwe have an anthroposophical programor solution to combat genetics. Such asolution would probably end up beingjust as abstract any other general pro-gram or answer. A geneticist might, forexample, accept the idea of reincarna-tion as a possible personal belief, but ifshe is confronted with this idea as an\"anthroposophical teaching\" that callsinto question genetic engineering ofhuman beings, it will leave her cold andshe can simply relegate it to the catego-ry of unscientific dogmatism. What Is so Bad About Genetic Engineering? Questions to Biologist Craig Holdrege Developments in genetic research are moving swiftly. Human and animal cells are being combined to create chimeras. We can be fascinated by the results andby the speed, which is breathtaking, but also alarming. There is fear that lifeitself will be used for life-threatening purposes. The biologist Craig Holdrege(U.S.A) has concerned himself with the question of genetic engineering. His veryreadable book on the subject, The Forgotten Context , is also acclaimed by pro- fessionals. We asked him what is so unsettling about genetic engineering. How effective is cloning technology? Are the problems that have causedfailures in cloning of a fundamentalnature or will they be solved?Compared to four years ago, cloningtechnology is advanced - there arecloned sheep, mice, cattle, goats, andmost recently pigs. But scientists are along way from realizing their goal ofproducing identical, ready-made ani-mals that automatically produce sub-stances to be used for pharmaceuticalpurposes. The techniques are still veryinefficient. Most of the experimentsdon't succeed, many of the cloned ani-mals die early or have malformities.Many fetuses, for example, are too bigand have to be delivered by cesareansection. Cloning techniques don't takeinto account that development is a liv-ing and complex process with continu-al and subtle interactions occurringbetween mother and fetus on the onehand and mother and her environmenton the other. Scientists can control fair-ly well what they do in the lab in theway of genetic alterations, but every-thing that happens in the organism orbetween organisms and environment isnot immediately controllable. Ofcourse the techniques will improve.Beyond the genetic control, scientistswill need to increase the standardiza-tion of the environment in order to getreplicable results. But this standardiza-tion brings impoverishment, whichshows itself in negative effects on theanimal's health. The animal as such isnot really taken into account in geneticand cloning technology until it makesitself known through ill health. In theend scientists can't get around the factthat animals are living beings that havetheir own integrity. Are the fears people have about cloning related to the underlying senti-ment that as human beings we aremore than the expression of bodilyprocesses, that we are beings who havefreedom, a biography and some formof immortality? That's surely the case. Every one of usfeels that we are ourselves and no oneelse. The thought that there could beanother being who is a copy of one'sself is abhorrent to this deep-seatedfeeling of individuality.

We can't say, \"Anthro-posophy teaches such and such,therefore...\"; we can only make astatement like \"I see and judge the matter in this way...\" Our society isguided by illusions and driven bytechnology. Anthroposophists canhelp overcome these powers bydeveloping and contributing what isotherwise direly lacking today: a mid-dle path between illusion and powerthat stems from the ability to view and take hold of problems in an indi-vidual, flexible, and concrete - whichmeans spirit-filled - way.

Sincespeech impulses arise in the \"astralbody modified by the I,\" we find cor-respondences here, too. Particularlysignificant with this form of illness isthe impulsification of the in-breath(the \"reaching upward\") whereas inthe case of the two previously men-tioned forms of illness we work withforming or releasing forces on theout-breath. Rudolf Steiner's indicationthat \"the I enters the blood via thelung\" can be experienced by bothspeech therapists and patients alike. Chronic illnesses of the blood and the so-called hereditary diseases arisewhen the I does not sufficiently orientits incarnation impulses from the spir-it. Rudolf Steiner indicates that by farthe most illnesses today arise from anI that receives too little impulse fromthe spirit. In speech therapy thehuman being learns to guide his in-breath according to a higher principle- language. It is interesting that Rudolf Stein- er especially recommended psycho-logical treatments for the last twoforms of illness mentioned, which areconnected with the in-breath from atherapeutic point of view. He recom-mended medicinal treatment only fordisturbed etheric and physicalprocesses. The approximately 70 par-ticipants in the seminar agreed thatspeech therapy should be consideredone of the psychological treatments,because in speech therapy, we workupon the etheric and physical bodiesvia the astral body (i.e., the breath). The fifth form of illness, karmic illness, raises still deeper questionsrelating to all of the areas of illnessmentioned above and to accidents,epidemics and certain mental illnesses. We have broad experience showingthat the karmic illnesses, too, are con-nected with breath and with rhythmicprocesses in a special way. In thissense we developed an ever clearerunderstanding of the connectionbetween speech/breath habitus andregular or irregular working of theaspects of the human being in allareas. So, as a prerequisite for futuretherapeutic approaches, there was acall for a continuation of this kind ofanthropology that is oriented to, orarises from, speech and breath. Thiswould clearly be a future-oriented,long overdue research project. Unfor-tunately only a few doctors haveshown any interest in this approachover the years. Attempts were madeto report on our research by organiz-ing \"Doctor Days,\" but the initiativewas discontinued due to the partici-pants' lack of time. Very interesting and inspiring is the combination of art, religion andscience. This is an approach that isvery fruitful for questions of anthro-pology. It seems to be increasinglyimportant to draw together RudolfSteiner's indications on variousthemes, and to evaluate and test themin practice. In this way it will be pos-sible to follow the traces of spiritual,creative activity right into physiology. In various plenum discussions participants have expressed regret athow little true interest is shown intheir work within the anthroposophi-cal movement. Sometimes non-anthroposophical institutions haveshown more interest in questions ofspeech therapy than have Waldorfschools or anthroposophical clinics,for example. Since we can look backon years of well-founded experience,we may hope that our efforts to gain anew understanding of speech andbreath will gradually find resonance. Barbara Denjean-von Stryk, Germany Note: This report refers to five years of research that were completed at Whitsun 2000 in Unter-lengenhardt, Germany. The subject was studiedwithin the framework of decades of annualspeech therapy workshops for doctors and cre-ative speech artists organized by Christa Slezak-Schindler (Institute for Speech Formation andCreative Speech Therapy fax 934 42 33.Rudolf Steiner speaks of five forms of illness that result from five specificirregularities within the correspondingaspect of the human being. Sinceevery irregularity is connected with adisturbance of rhythm, and sincespeech is based on the rhythmic rela-tion between heart and lung (bloodand breath), we can relate predisposi-tion pathology to disturbed breathingprocesses. When disturbances arereflected in the way a person speaks,they can also be therapied via speech. Speech irregularities arise from the interaction between two separateaspects of the human being. Too littlevividness or plasticity in the ethericbody can lead to weakness of theimmune system in the physical body(infections), for example. We canrelate this to Rudolf Steiner's com-ment that every word that we speakwithout plasticity is an inner cause ofillness. In our discussions we foundthat the plasticity and color of the pic-tures of sound and concept spoken onthe out-breath correspond to beingable to hold one's own in the outerworld (i.e., the air); plasticity strength-ens the immune system. Glandular illnesses arise when the astral body gives impulses to theetheric body that are either too weakor too strong. Our work showed acorrespondence with the voice here,because the voice (similar to a glandu-lar process) involves pouring and liq-uefaction on the etheric/astral plane.\"To speak vowels is to pour one'sinner life as something fluid.\" Acute illnesses arise when the I does not sufficiently control andHealing through Speech The Five Forms of Illnessand their Consequences for Diagnosis and TherapyMEDICAL SECTION For the past five years, research seminars with participants from Germany,Switzerland and the Netherlands have been studying the five forms of illnessmentioned by Rudolf Steiner. *Rudolf Steiner's relatively little known char- acterizations have proved to be extraordinarily fruitful to research becausethe connection between illness and the various parts of the human organismcan be applied directly to therapeutic practice. It is all the more surprisingthat this work has received so little attention within the anthroposophicalmovement. Actually, non-anthroposophical institutions have sometimesshown more interest. * In The Being of Man and His Future Evolu- tion, Rudolf Steiner Press 1981, GA 107 "}
