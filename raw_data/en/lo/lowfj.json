Study Design: We conducted a systematic review of the medical literature to identify all controlled epidemio-logical articles examining for an association between ASDand the MMR vaccine. We extracted data from the ar-ticles on the characteristics and objectives of the studyas well as evidence of an association. Results: Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria. One study found no difference in the rates of ASD and the MMRvaccine in children who were vaccinated and those whowere not. Six studies examined for evidence of an increasein ASD associated with an increase in the MMR vaccine cov-erage, none of which showed evidence of an association.Four studies examined if a variant form of ASD wasassociated with the MMR vaccine, none of which showed evidence of an association. Eight studies attempted to de-termine if there was a temporal association between de-veloping ASD and receiving the MMR vaccine. Of these, 1study identified an increase in parental concern in the6-month period following vaccination with MMR in oneof its analyses. The results of all other studies showed noassociation between ASD and the MMR vaccine. Conclusions: The current literature does not suggest an association between ASD and the MMR vaccine; how-ever, limited epidemiological evidence exists to rule outa link between a rare variant form of ASD and the MMRvaccine. Given the real risks of not vaccinating and thatthe risks and existence of variant ASD remain theoreti-cal, current policies should continue to advocate the useof the MMR vaccine. Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2003;157:628-634 IN1998 et al1pub- lished a 12 cases ofpervasive developmental delay as-sociated with gastrointestinal (GI)tract symptoms and developmen- tal regression, many of who reported soonafter the patient received a measles, mumps,and rubella (MMR) vaccination. This caseseries puts forth the hypothesis that a newvariant of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD)was developing and was associated with theMMR vaccine. Although the study washeavily criticized for its methods, it cre-ated widespread concern among the pub-lic about the safety of the MMR vaccine. 2De- spite government assurances, MMRvaccination rates have decreased in theUnited Kingdom resulting in measles out-breaks. 3In response to the growing public concern, several epidemiological studieshave been conducted to examine the asso- ciation between ASD and the MMR vac-cine. These studies have been designed toaddress several hypotheses put forth by thestudy of Wakefield et al and others that havecautioned against the use of the MMR vac- cine. The specific hypotheses that have beenexamined are (1) rates of ASD are higher inindividuals who have received the MMRvaccine than in those who have not, (2) anincrease in ASD may be occurring as a con-sequence of the MMR vaccine, (3) the de-velopment of ASD is temporally associated with receiving the MMR vaccine, and (4) a new variant form of ASD may be associ-ated with the MMR vaccine. In this articlewe systematically identify, summarize, andpresent the results of these studies.

We reviewed the articles associated withthese abstracts and selected final articles for inclusion in thesystematic review. To be included in our final review a manu-script had to (1) report the results of an original epidemiologi-cal study, (2) describe a systematic method of identifying asample (eg, analysis of ASD registry), (3) describe methods bywhich the diagnosis of ASD was established, and (4) attemptto determine if an association existed between MMR vaccina-tion and ASD. Any disputes on inclusion criteria of either ab-stracts or final articles were resolved by consensus and, if nec-essary, a third reviewer was consulted. DATA EXTRACTION In duplicate, we extracted data from the articles on the follow- ing: characteristics of the study\u2014first author, journal, yearof publication, country of study, study design, type and size ofpopulation studied, age of MMR vaccination, and method ofASD diagnosis; and study results\u2014type of association tested(comparison of rates of ASD in children receiving the MMR vac-cine and those who did not, change in rates of ASD associatedwith changes in MMR, temporal association of ASD with MMR,association of variant ASD with MMR), method of analysis, andresults of analysis. Any disagreements between the data extrac-tors were resolved by discussion until consensus was achieved.If manuscripts contained several analyses, we extracted dataonly on those analyses that met our inclusion criteria. We clas-sified results of the study by the type of association tested. Ifsome articles carried more than one type of analysis, we in-cluded these results in each relevant category. RESULTS SEARCH RESULTS We screened a total of 379 abstracts of potentially eli- gible articles. Of these abstracts we included 20 studies foradditional analysis. We excluded 10 studies that did notmeet our inclusion criteria for a variety of reasons includ-ing not having yet been completed, 7examining only for a link between the MMR vaccine and pathologic features ofthe GI tract, 8examining for a link between maternal MMR vaccination and development of ASD,9or only examin- ing for biological evidence of a link between ASD and theMMR vaccine.10One letter did examine directly for a link between ASD and the MMR vaccine but was not reportedin sufficient detail to be included. 11We also identified an additional 2 articles from references of reviews.12,13A fi- nal total of 12 articles were found to meet our inclusioncriteria and were included in this systematic review. 12-23 CHARACTERISTICS OF STUDIES The 12 studies included in the systematic review were conducted in 5 different countries ( Table 1 ). Data were obtained from populations born as far back as 1954.20 Three studies relied on the same data source15,16,21and another 2 studies also shared data sources13,14leaving a total of 9 distinct sources of data examined. The studiesvaried in design and included case series, time-series analy-ses, cross-sectional study designs, self-matched case se-ries, and retrospective cohort studies. Studies varied inhow ASD was diagnosed with most relying on the re-cords of services for autistic children or children with dis-abilities or International Classification of Diseases codes. The 3 studies that provided data on the age of the childwhen they received the vaccination suggested that theinitial MMR vaccination was received at ages 13 through17 months. 15,18,20,22 Hypothesis 1 Autistic spectrum disorder rates are higher in individuals who received the MMR vaccine compared with those whohave not been vaccinated. Only 1 study examined the rates of ASD in MMR vaccinated and not vaccinated individuals in the sameperiod. 22This study, a retrospective cohort of children in Denmark, identified no statistically significant differ-ences in rates of autism or ASD between these 2 popu-lations in adjusted and nonadjusted analyses ( Table 2 ). Hypothesis 2 Increasing rates of ASD are occurring as a consequence of the MMR vaccine. Six studies examined to see if there was an association between changes in the rate of ASD and changes in the levelof the MMR vaccine coverage ( Table 3 ).12,15,17,18,20,21These analyses were conducted in the United Kingdom, Sweden,and the United States. Of these, 4 studies conducted time-series analyses, none of which identified an obvious asso-ciation between an increase in ASD or variant ASD andequivalent increase in the MMR vaccine coverage. 15,17,18,21 One of the remaining 2 studies looked at the numbers ofcases of ASD before and after MMR vaccination programswere introduced and did not find an increase in ASD ratesin the period of MMR vaccination. 12The other study com- pared rates of developmental regression in a sample of au-tistic children before the MMR vaccine was introduced andafter it was introduced and found no significant differences. 20 Hypothesis 3 Development of ASD is temporally associated with receiv- ing the MMR vaccine.

These studies, however, foundno differences in the mean age at the time of diagnosisof ASD.

Of these, 1 study did not observe an increase in consultation ratesto general practitioners following MMR vaccination inchildren later diagnosed as having autism, when com-pared with nonautistic control subjects. 19One study, and an extended analysis of this study, examined a cohort ofchildren with ASD and found that these children werenot more likely to be diagnosed as having ASD, or iden-tified as having developmental regression, in specified pe-riods after having been vaccinated with the MMR vac-cine. 15,16An increased rate of parental concern was observed in the 6-month period following vaccination al-though this was not significant for any other period af-ter MMR vaccination. One study compared the rates ofparental concerns about bowel symptoms or regressionamong children who are autistic and who had receivedan MMR vaccination, children who are autistic before anMMR vaccination, and children who are autistic but werenot vaccinated, and found no significant differences. 21One study did not identify any cases of ASD in 1.8 million in-dividuals who had received MMR vaccinations. 13A Finn- ish study found no evidence of a clustering of hospital-izations for autism after children had received the MMRvaccine. 23A Danish study of a population cohort who had received the MMR vaccine found no association be-tween development of ASD and interval since vaccina-tion. 22 Hypothesis 4 A new variant form of ASD may be associated with the MMR vaccine. Four studies attempted to examine for a specific as- sociation of a variant form of ASD with the MMR vac-cine ( Table 5 ).14,20,21,23Variant ASD was identified by the presence of developmental regression or GI tract symp-toms. Of the 3 studies, 1 case series found that none of31 children who developed GI tract symptoms after MMRvaccination subsequently went on to develop ASD. 14One study did not find a difference in the rates of develop-mental regression in children with ASD in a sample ofchildren after the introduction of the MMR vaccine tothe population (post-MMR vaccination) when com-pared with a historical sample prior to the introductionof the MMR vaccine. 20The study also did not find a higher than expected prevalence of childhood disintegrative dis-order in the post-MMR vaccine sample. Another studydid not find an increase in the percentages of childrenwith autism who had GI tract symptoms or regressionafter the introduction of the MMR vaccine to that popu-lation. 21Another study found that none of the 309 chil- dren who had received the MMR vaccine and had sub-sequently been hospitalized with autism had also beenhospitalized with inflammatory bowel disease. 23 COMMENT The studies included in this review examined the hy-potheses put forth by Wakefield et al. 1None of the stud- ies we examined provided evidence of an association be-tween ASD and the MMR vaccine. Establishing whetherassociations exist between rare conditions and expo-sures is challenging, and the question of whether the MMRvaccine causes ASD is particularly difficult to answer forseveral reasons. The higher validity forms of observa-tional studies such as controlled cohorts and case-control studies are of limited usefulness owing to the smallnumbers of individuals who are not vaccinated after MMRTable 3.

Any comparison between MMR vaccinated and not vaccinated popula-tions after the introduction of a vaccination programwould also be confounded by the systematic differencesthat would exist between these 2 populations. We iden-tified only 1 study that conducted a (retrospective) co-hort analysis of rates of autism and ASD in children whoreceived the MMR vaccine and those who did not. 22This study, the highest validity evidence available on the exis-tence of an association, found no difference in the ratesof autism or ASD in these 2 populations. This study hadsufficient power and was adjusted for some potential con-founding variables. The remaining studies we examined had to make use of alternative methods to address the hypotheses. Eco-logical designs such as time-series analyses were used toanswer the question of whether changing rates in ASDwere related to changing rates in MMR vaccination. Thesestudy designs are limited by the potential of errone-ously drawing inferences on individuals from aggregatedata. In addition, any observed association or lack of as-sociation could be confounded by secular trends in themechanism of diagnosis of ASD. However, despite these limitations the strength of evidence against an associa-tion observed in the studies we examined provides us withconfidence that there is not an epidemic of ASD relatedto the MMR vaccine. The more specific question of a link between the MMR vaccine and a rare variant form of ASD cannot beruled out by such ecological analyses, however. This ques-tion also presents several methodological challenges andonly 4 of the studies examined for this. The study by Pel-tola et al, 14while providing useful information, had im- portant limitations owing to the potential for reportingbias and the limited sample size of 31 children. The studyby Makela et al 23only examined for evidence of hospi- talizations for inflammatory bowel disease in individu-als hospitalized with autism after having received the MMRvaccine. This study would not have identified other formsof GI tract disease, or patients who were not hospital-ized. 23The study by Fombonne and Chakrabarti,20while directly examining for a link between variant autism andthe MMR vaccine, was limited by the use of populationsfrom 2 distinct periods and is susceptible to bias fromTable 4.

The study by Taylor et al21was the highest- quality study examining this specific question and pro-vides the strongest evidence against a link between variantautism and the MMR vaccine. Perhaps the most convincing evidence that emerges from this review against a link between MMR and all casesof ASD is the data on temporal association. Eight stud-ies examined this specific question using a variety of meth-ods. The studies consistently demonstrated that chil-dren developed ASD at the same age, whether or not theywere vaccinated and were not more likely to present af-ter MMR vaccination. These results suggest that the ini-tial temporal association between the MMR vaccine andASD observed by Wakefield et al 1was likely a chance as- sociation owing to the fact that the initial presentationof ASD is often around the time of the MMR vaccine. The primary advantages of the review we have pre- sented are the systematic methods we used for reducingbias in identifying and appraising literature and the pre-sentation of data sorted by the type of hypothesis tested.We limited our review to epidemiological evidence andspecifically chose not to include data from case reportsor biological evidence. Although these other forms of evi-dence are useful in generating hypotheses, the epidemio-logical evidence we presented is the highest quality ofevidence available to establish whether an association ex-ists. However, the limitations of these data need to be rec-ognized. For example, the study by Patja et al, 13which relied on data from a passive reporting system for ad-verse events, identified no cases of autism in 1.8 millionvaccinees. This is well below the normal incidence of thecondition and suggests the presence of reporting bias. Sev-eral of the studies we included relied on records from ser-vices for children with disabilities for the diagnosis of ASDand are susceptible to the misclassification of develop- mental disorders. Our review did not explore the link be-tween the MMR vaccine and pathologic features of theGI tract that are not associated with ASDs. We also didnot identify studies, or extract data in included studies,that only sought to determine if a variant form of autismexisted and did not determine the association of this vari-ant form of autism to the MMR vaccine. The results of our review are consistent with the find- ings of other reviews. We particularly support the Insti-tute of Medicine's findings that there is no evidence ofan association between ASDs and the MMR vaccine al-though the ability of epidemiological studies to rule outan association between the vaccine and a rare form of ASDis limited. 10Since the Institute of Medicine review was conducted, 2 further studies examining for the associa-tion between the MMR vaccine and a specific form of au-tism have been published and also showed no link. 21,23 Nevertheless, the overall quality of evidence against thisparticular association is not as high as the evidence againstthe other hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS Our review finds no evidence of the emergence of an epi-demic of ASD related to the MMR vaccine. It also findsno evidence of an association between a variant form ofautism and the MMR vaccine although recognizing thatrelatively few studies have examined this specific ques-tion. The characterization of a variant form of autism re-mains the focus of considerable debate. 24,25Given the cur- rent evidence, if a variant form of ASD exists that isassociated with the MMR vaccine, it is sufficiently rareso as not to be identified by the current epidemiologicalstudies.Table 5.

Downloaded From: https://jamanetwork.com/ by a Mayo Clinic Library User on 02/03/2021While the risk of autism from MMR remains theo- retical, the consequences of not vaccinating are real withseveral studies demonstrating the health effect of reduc-ing vaccination coverage. 26,27Based on this evidence pub- lic health officials should continue to advocate vaccina-tion with MMR while continuing to recognize publicconcerns. The potential association of ASD and the MMRvaccine occupies a particularly high-risk space among thegeneral population by being both unknown and poten-tially catastrophic. 28Risks of this type can cause substan- tial concern amongst the public that may appear irratio-nal to public health officials. The public may require morestudies ruling out an association between the risk factorand disease for these types of risks than other types. Iffuture studies are conducted to examine this question,we recommend that they focus on identifying an asso-ciation between the MMR vaccine and a specific pheno-type of ASD rather than between the MMR vaccine andall forms of ASD.

Four studies have examined the pos-sibility of an association of the MMR vaccine and a newvariant form of ASD and found no link, although someof these studies had important methodological limita-tions. However, if a variant form of ASD were associ-ated with the MMR vaccine, it would have to be suffi-ciently rare so as not to be identified by these studies. Iffuture studies are to be conducted, they should attemptto determine if an association exists between the MMRvaccine and specific phenotypes of ASD.
