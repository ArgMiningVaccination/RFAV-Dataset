If re-elected in 2024, Biden would begin his second term at the age of 82. Only one-third of Americans think he has the physical stamina to be POTUS today; even fewer believe he has the mental capacity for the job. While Biden's obvious physical and mental decline at age 80 is not unusual or something to be criticized, it's absurd to ignore it and pretend it doesn't impact his ability to competently execute the duties of POTUS. For this reason, it's a matter of public concern and worthy of close examination. Biden refuses formal cognitive testing and has followed a prudent strategy: it is better to not take a cognitive exam and be suspected of having dementia than to fail the test and remove all doubt. In lieu of cognitive testing, Biden has instructed Americans to observe his performance and draw their own conclusions as to his mental and physical fitness to serve a second term as POTUS. In today's episode, I abide by the President's request. I gather abundant evidence from Biden's public performance, opinions from expert's and \"knowledgeable informants\", and present the evidence which reflects upon his mental and physical fitness for duty as POTUS. People can draw their own conclusions what that evidence means. - [\"Don't Look Up\" with Ron Howrigon](https://podcasts.apple.com/kw/podcast/dont-look-up-with-ron-howrigon/id1060256849?i=1000620620239) \"Don't Look Up\" with Ron Howrigon My guest is HealthCare Economist Ron Howrigon. In 2017, Ron wrote Flatlining: How Healthcare Could Kill the US Economy and had some dire predictions for our healthcare system and our economy if substantial changes weren't implemented. Today, Ron discusses his sequel to Flatlining called: CLEAR! Reforming Healthcare to Save the US Economy. In the movie \"Don't Look Up\", an asteroid the size of Mount Everest is headed toward earth. A group of astronomers warn the President that unless something is done urgently to alter the asteroid's course, earth will be destroyed. The strategy of the President and her government is, \"Don't look up.\" That is, if you don't look up you won't see the asteroid on collision course with earth, and somehow everything will be okay. Similarly, as the National Debt continues to soar, an ever-increasing Healthcare Cost is like an economy-destroying asteroid that's largely being ignored right now. In effect we're following the \"Don't Look Up\" strategy. How do we reign in the cost of US Healthcare, while maintaining access and quality and at the same time providing coverage for all who want it? Stay tuned and find out. - [Valentin Bruttel: The Molecular Evidence pointing to a synthetic origin of SARS-CoV-2](https://podcasts.apple.com/kw/podcast/valentin-bruttel-the-molecular-evidence-pointing-to/id1060256849?i=1000615675888) Valentin Bruttel: The Molecular Evidence pointing to a synthetic origin of SARS-CoV-2 Molecular biologist and immunologist Valentin Bruttel discusses what he believes is compelling molecular evidence indicating SARS-CoV-2 was engineered in a lab. He is the co-author, along with Alex Washburne, and Tony VanDongen of the preprint entitled: Endonuclease fingerprint indicates a synthetic origin of SARS-CoV-2. He recently published a comprehensive analysis of the molecular evidence pointing to a lab origin of COVID-19 in a YouTube presentation entitled: SARS-CoV-2 Origin: How we were misled and how molecular evidence proves it came from a lab. - [#RaccoonDogGate: New data does NOT link raccoon dogs to COVID-19's origin with Steve Massey...](https://podcasts.apple.com/kw/podcast/raccoondoggate-new-data-does-not-link-raccoon-dogs/id1060256849?i=1000610356656) #RaccoonDogGate: New data does NOT link raccoon dogs to COVID-19's origin with Steve Massey... On 3/17/23, the MSM news cycle was dominated by an incredible claim by a group of international scientists: \"new data\" from early 2020 linked raccoon dogs at the Wuhan Seafood Market to the origin of COVID-19. When \"Raccoon Dog Mediapalooza\" commenced, journalists and science reporters had no data, no preprint, and no peer reviewed paper to validate the claims of these scientists. Now we have all three. Independent analysis of the \"new data\" shows that the international scientists, largely comprised of \"the usual suspects,\" have once again misrepresented the evidence to support their preferred narrative [a natural spillover at the Huanan Seafood Market] and have co-opted the mainstream media to amplify it. Today, I interview Dr. Steven Massey to discuss #raccoondoggate, the data, what it shows\u2014and more importantly, what it does not show. Spoiler alert: No credible evidence links raccoon dogs to the origin of COVID-19. Period. After interviewing Steve, one conclusion is clear: it is absurd to conclude from the \"new data\" that an infected raccoon dog at the Huanan Seafood Market is linked to the origin of COVID-19. We answer the question proposed in the first installment of this travesty: Yes, raccoon dogs are the new pangolins! Dr. Massey is a researcher in bioinformatics, metagenomics and genomics, complexity and molecular evolution. - [DNA Contamination Discovered in Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccines with Kevin McKernan](https://podcasts.apple.com/kw/podcast/dna-contamination-discovered-in-moderna-and-pfizer/id1060256849?i=1000607666446) DNA Contamination Discovered in Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccines with Kevin McKernan In early February, Kevin McKernan, Chief Science Officer of Medicinal Genomics, was deep sequencing Moderna and Pfizer bivalent booster vaccines to help solve a technical problem with his sequencing process when he made an entirely unexpected discovery: the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent booster samples were contaminated with DNA that contained the Spike protein gene within it. Self-replicating DNA plasmids containing the spike protein gene are an integral part of the manufacturing process to make the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines; they are not supposed to be in the final product injected into humans. Kevin repeated the analysis on Pfizer's monovalent vaccine [the original COVID-19 vaccine requiring 3 jabs] using multiple different measuring tools and arrived at the same result: Plasmid DNA with the Spike gene contaminating the vaccine. When he measured the quantity of DNA it was an order of magnitude higher than the acceptable limit specified by the European Medicines Agency [EMA] in some lots. Today, I have Kevin McKernan in the virtual studio to explain his research, what he found, and what it means. #Plasmidgate. - [Raccoon Dog Mediapalooza with Mike Balter](https://podcasts.apple.com/kw/podcast/raccoon-dog-mediapalooza-with-mike-balter/id1060256849?i=1000607180880) Raccoon Dog Mediapalooza with Mike Balter On March 17th, at least 17 major news outlets published a story claiming a group of scientists had analyzed new genetic data from Chinese and that data linked raccoon dogs at the Huanan Seafood Market to the origin of COVID-19. At best, it was journalistic misfeasance, at worst it was willful misdirection. At the time \"raccoon dog mediapalooza\" dominated the news cycle, there was no data, no preprint, nor peer reviewed paper available for independent examination of the scientist's claims. \"Raccoon dog mediapalooza\" was based on \"quotes\" from \"the usual suspects\"; a cabal of virologists that have misstated, distorted, and/or overstated the evidence pointing to a natural spillover since the beginning of the pandemic. Today, I interview veteran journalist Mike Balter for the insider's perspective of the mainstream media coverage of the investigation of the origin of COVID-19 since the beginning. Their over-reliance on \"the usual suspects\" a small group of virologists with clear self interest in the outcome of an investigation into the origin of COVID-19. Mike has been a working journalist for more than four decades and wrote for Science Magazine for 25 of those years. It's a long interview but filled with many profound insights. "}
