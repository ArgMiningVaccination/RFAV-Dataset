The MHS leverages a $ 33.0 billion budget to support more than 125 thousand military and civilian personnel to support delivery of services in 49 hospitals, 427 medical clinics, and 246 dental clinics around the globe to support our 9.6 million beneficiaries. Our readiness mission spans a broad portfolio of operational requirements, such as combat casualty care, disaster relief, global health engagement, and humanitarian assistance. Key enablers of the system include Department of Defense (DoD) medical school, the Uniformed Services University of health Sciences (USUHS), plus a full spectrum of graduate medical education programs, and training platforms. Directed in the National Defense Authorization act (NDAA) for Fiscal Years 2017 and 2019, the MHS is undergoing its most significant transformation in decades. The reforms set forth in the NDAA change the structure of the health care benefit and the management of the MHS. Centralization for the management and administration of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) under the Defense Health Agency (DHA) transform the MHS into an integrated readiness and health system, eliminate redundancies, and create a common high quality experience for our beneficiaries. The FY 2020 Budget demonstrates continued progress towards this transformation through the realignment of resources supporting headquarters functions from the Medical Services of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to the DHA to support is increased responsibilities. In early 2017, the DHA began preparing to assume responsibility for the administration and management of MTFs worldwide. The assumption of these responsibilities commenced on October 1, 2018 with the transition of 31 facilities scattered throughout the south eastern portion of the United States. The remaining MTFs will transition in three subsequent phases. The second phase, executing in FY 2020, will transition an additional 241 MTFs, essentially all treatment facilities in the eastern portion of the United States, and result in 53% of facilities under the management control of the DHA. The third phase will execute in FY 2021 and will transition the remaining Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget Estima tes Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA -19, Introductory Statement DHP-3 CONUS based MTFs to the DHA representing a total of 83% of the MHS. The final phase will execute FY 2022 and consist of the remaining 17% of the MHS. The Defense Health Program (DHP) Operation and Maintenance (O&M) appropriation funding provides for worldwide medical and dental services to active forces and other eligible beneficiaries, veterinary services, occupational and industrial health care, specialized services for the training of medical personnel, and medical command headquarters. The MHS purchases more than 65 percent of the total care provided for beneficiaries through tailored contracts, such as Managed Care Support contracts responsible for the administration of the TRICARE benefit. The DoD Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund (MERHCF) is an accrual fund to pay for DoD's share of applicable Direct Care and Private Sector Care operation and maintenance health care costs for Medicare- eligible retirees, retiree family members and survivors. The DHP appropriation also funds the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) program for medical Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT), research to reduce medical capability gaps, and support to both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) medical laboratory facilities. The DHP appropriation Procurement program funds acquisition of capital equipment in MTFs and other selected health care activities which include equipment for initial outfitting of newly constructed, expanded, or modernized health care facilities; equipment for modernization and replacement of uneconomically reparable items; and MHS information technology (IT) requirements. The DoD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are collaboratively analyzing approaches, processes, organizational designs, governance, and management structures in support of gaining efficiencies and optimizing the use of resources in pursuit of deploying a seamless integrated electronic health record. At this time, our initial analysis indicates that existing statutes, funding levels, and contractual authorities provide the Departments the flexibility and resources needed to support the full range of organizational design options.

The Quadruple Aim provides a focused and balanced approach to overall performance. This approach includes not only production but outcome measures related to medical readiness, a healthy population, positive patient experiences and the responsible management of health care costs. Individual Medical Readiness - This measure provides operational commanders, Military Department leaders and primary care managers use this measure to monitor the medical readiness status of their personnel, ensuring a healthy and fit fighting force medically ready to deploy. This represents the best- available indicator of the medical readiness of the Total Force (Active Component and Reserve Component) prior to deployment. Beneficiary Satisfaction with Health Plan - Satisfaction is measured using a standard survey instrument comparable to those used by civilian plans. The goal is to improve MHS beneficiary overall satisfaction with TRICARE to a level at or above benchmark satisfaction with civilian plans. Increasing satisfaction with the Health Plan indicates that actions being taken are improving the overall functioning of the health plan from the beneficiary perspective. Medical Cost Per Member Per Year - This measure focuses on the annual overall cost growth for the Prime enrollees and includes all costs related to health care delivered to enrollees. The objective is to keep the rate of cost growth for the TRICARE Prime enrollees to a level at or below the increases for the Civilian health care plans at the national level. Currently the measure provides insight to issues regarding unit cost, utilization management, and Purchased care management. The metric has been enhanced to properly account for differences in population demographics and health care requirements of the enrolled population. Since enrollment demographics can vary significantly by Service, and across time, it is important to adjust the measure. For example, as increasing numbers of older individuals enroll, the overall average medical expense per enrollee would likely increase. Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget Estima tes Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA -19, Introductory Statement DHP-11 Conversely, as younger, healthy active duty enroll, the overall average would likely decrease. Through the use of adjustment factors, a comparison across Services and across time is made more meaningful. Output related measures that influence Medical Cost Per Member Per Year: Inpatient Production Target (Medicare Severity Adjusted Relative Weighted Products, referred to as MS- RWPs) - Achieving the production targets ensures that the initial plan for allocation of personnel and resources are used appropriately in the production of inpatient workload. Outpatient Production Target (Relative Value Units, referred to as RVUs) - Achieving the production targets ensures that the initial plans for allocation of personnel and resources are used appropriately in the production of outpatient workload. Below is reporting for FY 2018 performance measures related to the Quadruple Aim, and two output measures related to production plan targets. The overall success of each measured is discussed below: Individual Medical Readiness - The Military Health System achieved the goal for the Total Force Medical Readiness as of FY 2018 4th quarter reporting with a score of 86.5 percent compared to the goal of 85 percent. This represents the fifth year in a row that the MHS has surpassed the performance goal for the measure. Based on this achievement, a higher performance goal of 90 percent will be gradually phased in for future years. Beneficiary Satisfaction with Health Plan - Satisfaction with Health Care Plan performance for FY 2018 was 65%, which exceeded the goal of 57 percent for the fiscal year. Satisfaction levels met or exceeded the goal for all beneficiary categories and enrollment status. This has been a continuous process to maintain and improve performance to levels comparable with the civilian sector, and performance must be maintained. Major performance drivers for this measure are related to claims processing timeliness, interaction during health care encounter, and access to health care. During the recent contract conversion, claims Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget Estima tes Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA -19, Introductory Statement DHP-12 processing timeliness didn't suffer, and the MHS focus continues with health care interactions and access. NOTE: Due to the deployment of MHS GENESIS, sites in the Puget Sound Enhanced Multi -Service Market Area are excluded from the following three measures and the goals have been adjusted accordingly for the two production measures related to Inpatient and Outpatient Care. Medical Cost Per Member Per Year - Annual Cost Growth - The Year to Date performance estimate for FY 2018 is 1.7 percent vs goal of 3.4 percent. While final claims data are still lagging, the system currently is achieving the goal during the fiscal year. Overall the growth rate is well below historical levels, and may increase as medical claims data are finalized. Inpatient Production Target (MS- RWPs) - Based on workload reported through the 4th fiscal quarter of FY 2018, the MHS produced 173 thousand MS- RWPs, slightly below the annual adjusted target of 177 thousand MS- RWPs. These numbers are based on the records reported to date, and should increase slightly as all records are completed.

Per 5 CFR 959.107, OMB must approve this plan prior to the agency entering into any PCA service agreement. Changes to this plan must be reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with 5 CFR 959.107. Reporting: In addition to the plan, each year, components utilizing PCA will include their PCA worksheet in the OMB Justification (OMBJ) , typically in September. OMB and OPM will use this data for Budget development and congressional reporting. Plan for Implementing the PCA program: 1a) Identify the categories of physician positions the agency has established are covered by PCA under \u00a7 595.103. Please include the basis for each category. If applicable, list and explain the necessity of any additional physician categories designated by your agency (for categories other than I through IV -B).

Pharmacy Footnote: The FY 2019 projected requirement of $1,823.2M exceeds the current estimate of $1,650,647K by $172.7M. Current execution shows a 19% increase in the average cost per script over the same period in FY 2018. Current execution shows increased fill of specialty drugs targeted for very specific conditions. Although these drugs have low usage, the costs of the therapies are extremely high at thousands of dollars per treatment. The increase is the result of new, more expensive, brand named medications entering the market with no generics. T he DHA Pharmacy Operations Division will continue to monitor execution to determine if additional funding is required.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Uniformed Services of the Health Sciences (USUHS), this program element supports basic medical research at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). It facilitates the recruitment and retention of faculty; supports unique research training for military medical students and resident fellows; and allows the University's faculty researchers to collect pilot data towards military relevant medical research projects in order to secure research funds from extramural sources (estimated $180 million annually). Approximately 48 intramural research projects are active each year, including 18 faculty start-ups. Projects are funded on a peer- reviewed, competitive basis. Results from these studies contribute to the knowledge base intended to enable technical approaches and investment strategies within Defense Science and Technology (S&T) programs. USU enriches the training of the next generation of physicians/scientists who directly benefit the quality, outcomes, and stability of the military health care delivery system. The ILIR program at USUHS is designed to answer fundamental questions of importance to the military medical mission of the Department of Defense in the areas of Combat Casualty Care, Infectious Diseases, Military Operational Medicine, and Chemical, Biological, and Radiologic Defense.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification At the President's direction in late 2013, a National Strategy was created to address the critical issue of antimicrobial resistance. This strategy was devised using an interagency approach and ultimately approved at the executive level (2014). Inherent in this work are DoD sponsored efforts to support the DoD's beneficiaries, but also complement national efforts to prevent, detect, and control illness and death related to infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One critical need identified is for new therapeutics, to include antibiotics. This effort's focus is on the development of new/novel antibiotics, especially those targeting the most resistant and worrisome Gram negative bacterial pathogens, using existing expertise at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and leveraging other WRAIR capabilities to evaluate viable candidate targets for advanced discovery. This project supports (both directly and indirectly) Global Health Security Agenda priorities to respond rapidly and effectively to biological threats of international concern. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria (CARB) - WRAIR Discovery and Wound Program (Army) Description: Focus on continued establishment of in-house capabilities for an antibacterial drug discovery program directed toward military relevant drug-resistant bacteria that a) encompasses assessment of external products/candidates/leads that may meet DoD requirements, b) opens active intramural based discovery efforts of new potential products/candidates/leads for development, and c) fosters partnerships with external collaborators to develop/co-develop new potential antibacterial treatment therapeutics. FY 2019 Plans: CARB program continues its research efforts to evaluate viable small molecule candidate antibacterial agents for planned development for the DoD and Public Health benefit. In addition, the program continues its market analysis efforts of established, non-DoD antibiotic programs to identify other promising compounds that could potentially treat military relevant resistant bacteria, establishing partnership and intellectual property rights agreements where necessary. These promising compounds are screened against military relevant strains and biofilms (microorganisms in which cells stick to each other on a surface) in order to select compounds for continued development. Specifically designed novel drugs are then synthesized to support lead optimization efforts, exploiting established in vivo (living organism) model standards to treat military relevant resistant bacteria.

Although, those findings need to evaluate in partial-body animal studies using either SARRP or LINAC. -Evaluated the IL-18 level in urine of NHPs total-body irradiated with 60Co gamma-rays and demonstrated its great utility as a non-invasive early prognostic indicator of survival facilitated rapid detection of radiation exposure that might be suitable for field- deployable biodosimetry point-of-care to determine the exposure dose in a few minutes. -Demonstrated that the urine IL-18 levels combined with other biomarkers measured in blood provided highly discriminatory power, specificity and sensitivity of radiation exposure. -Created ARS severity score response categories in mouse and NHP TBI gamma-rays studies reveled good similarities with one created in radiation accident victims. -Completed comparison of some results/data from the NHP dose-response TBI (gamma- and x-rays) studies with data collected in radiation accident victims and radiation therapy patients and revealed good similarities. -Evaluated and demonstrated the different responses of mouse hematopoietic and immune cells to low-moderate doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 Gy) of total-body -irradiation (TBI). Radiation < 1 Gy can damage hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells; low dose radiation-induced decrease of stem cell factor (SCF) in mouse BM and increase in circulating proinflammatory factors may be responsible for the enhanced sensitivity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to radiation. -Developed a novel method, using long-range quantitative PCR to determine radiation-induced nuclear and mitochondria DNA damage. -Demonstrated the circulating microRNA (miR)-30 and miR-34 as radiation biomarkers in mice which can also be used to track radiation-induced apoptosis in human and mouse cells. - Established the severity of mortality and platelet depletion dependence on radiation doses and dose rates. - Established the severity of lymphocyte depletion and concentrations of biomarkers G-CSF, IL-18, Flt-3 dose-response calibration curves (60Co-gamma rays at 0.6 Gy/min and 0.1 Gy/min) for automated scoring of dicentrics chromosome aberrations (DCA) that enable rapid radiation dose assessment.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Internal Contamination (USU): For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), the mission and research objective for Internal Contamination is to determine whether the short-term and long-term radiological and toxicological risks of embedded metals warrant changes in the current combat and post-combat fragment removal policies for military personnel. Additionally, the biological effects of internalization of radioactive elements from Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDDs) and depleted uranium weapons, as well as therapeutic approaches to enhance the elimination of radionuclides from the body are being investigated. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Internal Contamination (USUHS) Description: Radioactive material can enter the body by a variety of pathways including ingestion, inhalation, and wound contamination. While some internalized isotopes will be naturally eliminated from the body, many others are not. They remain immobile or are transported and deposited to other organs where they continually irradiate the surrounding tissue. This chronic internal radiation exposure can cause unrepairable cellular damage eventually leading to death. This Program uses innovative approaches to address this pressing health concern. FY 2018 Plans: Continue cytotoxicity testing of surrogate-templated molecularly imprinted polymers for extraction of radionuclide contaminants; begin assessment of extracorporeal decorporation techniques to determine blood purification and chelation efficiencies of the polymers in a laboratory rat model. Design feasibility study to assess potential of chemically-modified dendrimeric structures as radionuclide decorporation agents and to optimize the efficiency of the designed polymers as decorporation agents. Continue assessment of dendrimeric structures for further optimization as a promising radionuclide decorporation agent in regard to desired properties such as specificity, binding strength and lower cytotoxicity. Initiate a study to determine if non-toxic plant-based metal chelators can be effectively used as radionuclide decorporation agents for the treatment of internal radionuclide contamination. FY 2018 Accomplishments: -Molecularly imprinted polymers prepared using ternary and silica-based protocols, with zinc as the surrogate template, were able to bind cobalt from simulated serum and intestinal fluids. -Molecularly imprinted polymers prepared using silica-based protocols, with copper as the surrogate template, were able to bind uranium from simulated serum and intestinal fluids.0.143 0.146 0.149 Volume 1 - 43 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602787DHA: Medical Technology (AFRRI) UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Agency Page 10 of 15 R-1 Line #4Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Date: February 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130 / 2R-1 241B / Contamination (USUHS) B.

FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 -Published report on the utility of radiation-induced biomarker panels used to develop an algorithm based on a baboon TBI vs PBI study to predict the severity of hematopoietic (i.e. blood elements) acute radiation syndrome demonstrating proof-of-concept that prognostic biomarkers can provide early-phase diagnostic information to guide medical treatment decisions for radiological casualties with life-threatening radiation exposures. -Performed an internal self-assessment of the quality control program for radiation dose assessment by cytogenetics to identify remaining tasks to support an eventual request for clinical laboratory certification. -Initiated discussions with radiation oncologists to evaluate human blood samples from radiation therapy patients using a panel of radiation-responsive biomarkers to validate novel approaches for radiation dose and injury assessment. -Reported on the utility of the early-phase changes after radiation exposure on neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in various animal (i.e., mice, dogs, rhesus monkeys, and baboons) and human radiation model systems to provide the ability to access radiation exposure. -Developed algorithms applying blood cell and/or biochemical markers for assessing the efficacy of radioprotectants, using archived irradiated nonhuman primate data. -Reported on radiation quality effects (i.e., mixed field neutron vs gamma ray exposures) on hematopoietic biomarkers using an archived baboon radiation model. Established an ARS severity scoring system using the baboon model based on hematology changes that permits assessment of radiation injury independent of radiation quality and total vs partial-body exposures. -Participated in interagency collaboration with REAC/TS and the Naval Dosimetry Center to further design the concepts of operation for the US Biodosimetry Network. Reported these efforts at an international biodosimetry conference. - Demonstrated that total body irradiation (TBI) and partial body irradiation (PBI) resulted in decreases in splenocyte counts at a similar level as shown in both deceased minipigs exposed to TBI and survived minipigs exposed to PBI. The major difference was that the levels of circulating insulin-like growth factor in dead animals were remarkably higher than that in living ones. Therefore, IGF-1 could be a good biomarker for radiation exposure and a determinant for lethality. Unlike minipigs, IGF-1 levels in blood of mice did not have such distinct difference between dead living mice. - Demonstrated that ATP decreased after TBI in minipigs and mice. The underlying mechanism with ATP decreases were explored successfully and understood in mice, suggesting that ATP biogenesis and maintenance after irradiation is one of major targets for developing remedial drugs in both minipigs and mice. FY 2019 Plans: FY 2019 plans continue efforts as outlined in FY 2018.

The Outside Continental US (OCONUS) laboratories conduct focused medical research on vaccine development for Malaria, Diarrhea Diseases, and Dengue Fever. In addition to entomology, HIV studies, surveillance and outbreak response under the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) program and risk assessment studies on a number of other infectious diseases that are present in the geographical regions where the laboratories are located. The CONUS laboratories conduct research on Military Operational Medicine, Combat Casualty Care, Diving and Submarine Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Environmental and Occupational Health, Directed Energy, and Aviation Medicine and Human Performance. For the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS), medical research and development programs are divided into five primary thrust areas: En-Route care, Expeditionary Medicine, Operational Medicine (in-garrison care), Force Health Protection (FHP) (detect, prevent, threats), and Human Performance. Expeditionary Medicine is focused on care on the battlefield and in field hospitals prior to transporting patients out of theater to CONUS, and studies trauma resuscitation, hemorrhage control, and other life-saving interventions to keep critically wounded patients alive in the golden hour and to the next level of care. The AFMS is the only service transporting patients on long aeromedical evacuation missions. Therefore, the En-Route care thrust area studies include investigation on the impact of transport on patient and providers (including cabin altitude, noise, vibration, and environmental issues affecting physiology on the aircraft), patient safety factors during transport, medical technologies for use during transport, and research to support education and training with simulation for En-Route care providers. The Human Performance thrust area focuses on optimizing airmen physical and psychological performance, assessing the physical and cognitive demands on the operator (pilot/aircrew), facilitating a safe aviation environment through technology and equipment assessment, and improving/sustaining airmen performance through training. Medical development and biomedical technology investments in FHP seek to deliver an improved FHP capability across the full spectrum of operations with research that prevents injury/ illness through improved identification and control of health risks. Under FHP, sub-project areas include Occupational Hazard Exposure (Includes Flight Hazards and Integrated Risk), Targeted Risk Identification, Mitigation and Treatment (Formerly Pathogen ID and Novel Therapeutics and includes Big Data), FHP Technologies Development and Assessment (Assay and disease detection), and Health Surveillance, Infection, Injury & Immunity. FHP also includes Innovations and Personalized Medicine. Operational medicine is focused on in garrison care - our next most critical issue post OIF/OEF - and how to care for the whole patient and consideration of comorbidities in treatment of wounded warriors and dependents. For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), medical development programs include the Prostate Cancer Center of Excellence (CoE), the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM), the Pain CoE, the Breast Cancer CoE, and the Gynecological Cancer CoE. The Prostate CoE, formerly a CSI, was chartered in 1992 to conduct basic, clinical, and translational research programs to combat diseases of the prostate. The Center's mission is fulfilled primarily through its three principal programs -- the Clinical Translational Research Center, the Basic Science Research Program, and the Tri-Service Multicenter Prostate Cancer Database, which encompasses its clinical research work with other participating military medical centers. These affiliated sites contribute data and biospecimens obtained from prostate cancer patients who participate in clinical trials. CNRM brings together the expertise of clinicians and scientists across disciplines to catalyze innovative approaches to TBI research. CNRM research programs emphasize aspects of high relevance to military populations, with a primary focus on patients at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Sepsis is the common path to end-organ damage and death for a large proportion of globally-important infectious diseases. This project will improve the understanding of disease pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms through network and biomarker analysis thus offering unique opportunities for improving sepsis diagnosis and management. Through systematic biology, it will develop insight into the disease pathogenesis of sepsis, and host factors which predict susceptibility, and sepsis severity provides opportunity for targeted interventions to forestall morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, enhanced knowledge of emerging antimicrobial resistance in strategic regions informs ongoing surveillance and mitigation efforts of critical importance to deployed forces. Successful completion of this project will provide reliable antimicrobial resistance data for forces deploying to Egypt and the region and also document improved methods for the treatment and management of sepsis. ACESO is an international consortium of sepsis researchers led by Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) that has established a network of sepsis research sites in SE Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa to improve clinical outcomes and advance our understanding of pathogenesis, biomarkers of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance trends. The largest infectious disease hospital in Egypt, Abbassia Fever Hospital, provides critical severe infection and antimicrobial resistance data from the North African Theater. This project supports (both directly and indirectly) Global Health Security Agenda priorities: Combat Antibiotic Resistance Bacteria (CARB); Prevent Avoidable Epidemics; Detect Threats Early; and Respond Rapidly and Effectively to biological threats of international concern.

This project will improve understanding of pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms through network and biomarker analysis to offer unique opportunities for improving sepsis diagnosis and management. Most specifically, ACESO will execute biomarker discovery identifying diagnostic and prognostic biomarker panels which may improve sepsis management in all environments including resourced and austere. FY 2018 Accomplishments: FY 2018 efforts supported continued enrollment of severely ill patients in an observational study in Cambodia at Takeo Provincial Hospital and in Ghana at Komfo Anoyke Teaching Hospital (KATH). The goals of this study are to 1) identify diagnostic and prognostic markers, 2) investigate common pathogenic pathways, 3) describe the spectrum of pathogens causing sepsis,1.238 0.000 - Volume 1 - 89 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603115DHA: Medical Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Agency Page 32 of 105 R-1 Line #6Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Date: February 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130 / 2R-1 Medical Technology DevelopmentProject (Number/Name) 247B / Mitigate the Global Impact of Sepsis Through ACESO (CARB) (Navy) B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 4) describe the treatment strategies currently in use, and 5) assess the long-term sequelae. Adult patients with suspected infection and evidence of systemic inflammation were considered for enrollment. Laboratory testing augmented the testing routinely performed at the hospital microbiology laboratory, and included diagnostic tests (e.g. blood cultures, malaria smears, HIV tests, and serology), molecular diagnostics, and assays measuring the host-response (RNA sequencing, proteomics, and metabolomics). Sophisticated analytic and statistical approaches are being applied to the complex data set to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers for sepsis and to investigate common pathogenic pathways. The Vietnam-Australia-US military study of drug resistance patterns in Central Vietnam was closed in Jan 2017 due to a lower than expected malaria burden. Preliminary data supports previous findings, reported in FY16, that there is no resistance for 1st choice malaria drug treatments. Additionally, a review of Vietnam malaria burden, control measures and environmental factors was initiated; the preliminary findings suggest increased average daily temperature was a primary factor of decreased malaria rates. Recruitment for the cross-sectional study in Gai Lia Province (on the border with Cambodia) started in Dec 2016 and was completed in Feb 2017. Sample and data analysis are ongoing, however, preliminary results from the >3,000 participants indicate the rate of patients without symptoms, but still carrying malaria parasite, was >1.25% in this study population, representing a silent malaria transmission risk in this forested, border region on the Cambodia-Vietnam border. The study of Vietnamese workers returning from Africa was initiated in Q2 FY17 with concurrent records review was stated for malaria patients recently returned from Africa presenting for care at two referral medical facilities in Ha Noi in 2014-2016. Preliminary results were accepted for presentation at the Joint International Tropical Medicine Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand from 06-08 Dec 2017. These data suggest delayed malaria clearance in patients returning from Africa was likely due to delayed medical treatment and not from malaria drug resistance. FY 2019 Plans: FY18/19 funding will continue the support of the observational study at the Takeo Provincial Hospital in Cambodia and Komfo Anoke Teaching Hospital in Ghanna. It will also support the translation of observational studies at the Abbassia Fever Hospital to develop sophisticated analytical and statistical approaches to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers for sepsis and to investigate common pathogenic pathways. Additionally, antimicrobial resistance patterns determined from the observational studies will be combined with prognostic markers for sepsis and common pathogenic pathway data to achieve improved patient outcomes. The project will be completed by the end of FY19, therefore, no funding is budgeted in the years following.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project area seeks to deliver improved capabilities across the full spectrum of operations in the areas of Directed Energy and Occupational and Environmental Health. Research in the Directed Energy sub-project area seeks to develop technologies to \"detect to warn\" and \"detect to protect\" AF operators such that they can take appropriate actions to prevent or minimize exposure leading to adverse health effects. Research in the Occupational and Environmental Health sub-project area involves the assessment and implementation of innovative new technologies that enable effective surveillance, detection, identification, and mitigation of hazardous chemical, biological, and physical hazards that present a health risk to our forces and threaten to degrade and disrupt the missions they execute. Air Force FHP efforts focus on health protection across the spectrum of AF air and ground operations. These include hazards presented to high performance and high flyer aircraft crews facing extreme environments within their flight envelopes that are potentially more sensitive to physiologic and cognitive stressors and rely on aircraft systems to provide life support for protection. Because Air Force installations are typically very strategically important in combat execution, they are more often tied to performing ops at fixed locations; therefore, they drive the need to detect and identify the USAF and environment-specific risks posed by chemical, biological, directed energy, and other radiological and physical hazards immediately and on-site so that operations can be resumed as quickly as possible. This requires enhanced monitoring capability, such as man-portable gold-standard hazard detection. Research is needed to improve these capabilities and to account for emerging threats.

The CPDR integrates expertise of urologic and epidemiologists, bio-statisticians, medical technologists, research nurses, patient educators, bioinformaticians, and program management specialists. All these areas of expertise provide state-of-the-art resources for in-house and collaborative research in prostate cancer. The program is also committed to translational research training for future generations of physicians and scientists at leading DoD medical institutions (USU, WRNMMC, JPC, NMCSD, MAMC, 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: CoE-Prostate Cancer Center of Excellence (USUHS) Description: The CPDR is at the forefront of \"cutting-edge\" clinical, basic science and epidemiologic research. The emphasis is on improving diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of prostate cancer involving new modalities such as MRI guided biopsy, gene- based biomarkers, and precision medicine strategies targeting causal gene alterations in prostate cancer. The CPDR multi- center database is a unique programmatic resource, enrolling over 27,500 DoD health care beneficiaries under suspicion for prostate cancer, with longitudinal follow up to 23 years. This database continues to highlight emerging issues in prostate cancer management such e.g., treatment outcomes, racial/ethnic differences, quality of life and discovery of novel molecular prognostic markers. In light of current issues related to overtreatment of early detected prostate cancers and poorly understood biology of prostate cancer, CPDR's long-term biospecimen banks, high-impact discoveries and collaborations are leading towards better diagnostic and prognostic molecular markers and therapeutic targets with promise in improving the management of the disease. The CPDR's health disparity research focus has uniquely benefited from studying a prostate cancer patient cohort, with a high representation of African American men, in an equal-access military health care system. Ground-breaking studies of the most validated prostate cancer gene, ERG, in over 1,500+ patients provide the first definitive information on prostate cancer biology underscoring racial/ethnic differences with potential to enhance personalized medicine.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification To better protect mounted warriors from the effects of underbody blast (UBB) caused by landmines or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), UBB Testing medical research project will provide new data on the biomechanics of human skeletal response that occurs in an attack on a ground combat vehicle. The data will provide a biomedical basis for the development of a Warrior-representative blast test manikin (the Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin or WIAMan project) and the required biomedically-valid injury criteria that can be used in Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) to characterize dynamic events, the risk of injury to mounted warriors, and to support acquisition decisions. This new data will also benefit the overall DoD effort in vehicle and protection technology for the UBB threat. This work is needed to overcome the limitations of the current test manikin and injury criteria which were designed for the civilian automotive industry for frontal crash testing and as such are not adequate in the combat environment. The current manikins do not represent the modern Warrior and were not designed for the vertical acceleration environment associated with UBB events. Consequently, current LFT&E crew survivability assessment methodologies are limited in their ability to predict the types and severity of injuries seen in these events. Due to this technology gap, military ground vehicles are being fielded without fully defined levels of injury risk and crew survivability for UBB events. The data produced by this project will be used to satisfy a critical need for a scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Underbody Blast Testing Description: Testing will provide an understanding of the biomechanics of skeletal injuries that occur in a combat vehicle UBB event involving a landmine or IED, and the biomedical basis for the development of a Warrior-representative blast test manikin and associated biomedically-validated injury criteria that can be used to characterize dynamic events and injury risks for LFT&E crew survivability assessments and vehicle development efforts to better protect Warriors from UBB threats. FY 2019 Plans: Biofidelity response corridors will be used to validate second generation prototypes of the WIAMan. Human injury assessment curves will continue to be developed for the lower extremities, pelvis and spine from laboratory testing that created thresholds of cadaveric fractures and subsequent severe injuries (i.e., complex fractures). Laboratory testing to generate female post mortem human subject injury tolerances will continue and will be used to inform the analysis of alternatives for developing a female specific manikin.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project funds research to develop candidate Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) vaccines, to assess their safety and effectiveness in human subjects, and to protect the military personnel from risks associated with HIV infection. All HIV technology development is conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Evaluations in human subjects are conducted to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of candidate vaccines, as required by FDA regulation. Studies are conducted stepwise: first, to prove safety; second, to demonstrate the desired effectiveness of the vaccine in a small study (to demonstrate early proof-of-concept); and third, to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human population clinical trials. All results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This project supports studies for effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to advanced developers for completion of effectiveness testing in larger populations. This program is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement between the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments or other government organizations.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification DoD Cancer Moonshot - Applied Proteogenomics Organizational Learning and Outcomes (APOLLO) Consortium (USUHS) DoD's Cancer Moonshot requirement is a mission of the Murtha Cancer Center (MCC) at USU under the authority of a tri-federal Memorandum of Agreement signed July 2016 by the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (DoD), the Under Secretary of Health, Department of Veterans Affairs(VHA), and the Acting Director of the National Cancer Institute (NIH), for a tri-federal program of Clinical Proteogenomics Cancer Research. DoD's Cancer Moonshot promotes readiness and mission accomplishment of the active duty service member (ADSM) force, as well as military beneficiaries, retirees, and veterans. There are about 1,000 ASDMs who are stricken with a new cancer diagnosis annually, and MCC serves as the DoD's Health Affairs-approved Center of Excellence for cancer care and research for these ADSMs. MCC's mission is to bring translational cancer research to all patients in order to improve their health and mission performance, and to help prevent, screen, detect, and treat cancer; minimize side effects of cancer treatments;, and return to duty ADSMs stricken with cancer, as well all other DoD beneficiaries. DoD's Cancer Moonshot initiative allows for the provision of state-of-the-art molecular analysis of tumors and blood of cancer patients which will result in increased force readiness through more targeted treatment of cancers with fewer side effects, as well as better screening for cancer risk and development. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: DoD Cancer Moonshot - Applied Proteogenomics Organizational Learning and Outcomes (APOLLO) Description: Description: DoD's Cancer Moonshot at USU's MCC is a research program consisting of two overall projects, the first known as APOLLO (Applied Organizational Learning and Outcomes), and the second as DoD Framingham. APOLLO is a novel high-throughput molecular analysis of every DNA (gene), RNA, and protein expression molecule in cancer patient tumors. Such analysis has never been done on a large scale across multiple cancer types, and small pilot studies demonstrate that the APOLLO project will result in unprecedented findings across all types of cancer (with specific focus on cancers of the greatest threat to ASDMs). These new findings will be identified by using state-of-the-art tissue collection procedures in the operating rooms of all patients undergoing cancer surgery at MCC collection protocol sites (e.g.. Walter Reed NMMC;NMC Portsmouth; Diego; Womack the entire DNA genome and RNA sequence at USU, while analyzing the entire protein expression profile of these same cancers in MCC's Proteomics Laboratory, as well as other affiliated protein laboratories.

These combined data sets will be housed in National Cancer Institute (NCI) secure cloud-based servers with restricted access for analytics by teams of bioinformatics experts (i.e., from government, university, and corporate entities) across the United States working on this endeavor. This complete bio molecular (global) expression profiling of thousands of cancers of all types seen in military treatment and other facilities will predictably result in a myriad of new discoveries regarding the way cancers develop, progress, respond to treatment, evade treatment, and spread. It also will result in new ways to combat cancers and minimize side effects of cancer treatment, as well as identify novel cancer screening and prevention opportunities, while focusing on militarily-relevant cancers and ADSMs with cancer, distinguishing it from any effort that might develop in the future in a civilian organization, as none of this scale exists today. There are five specific APOLLO sub-projects, which are classified based on the organ type of cancer under study: APOLLO 1 = Lung cancer; APOLLO 2 = Gynecological cancer; APOLLO 3 = Prostate cancer; APOLLO 4 = Breast cancer; and APOLLO 5 = all other cancer types. Both of these projects in the DoD Cancer Moonshot program were specifically developed to focus on ADSM with cancer (readiness), utilize molecular laboratories that are American owned and operated (U.S. DoD and DOE), keep all sensitive de- identified clinical and molecular data on U.S. government computers and servers for maximum data security and analysis (through the NCI), and benefit the nation through any and all discoveries that are made. FY 2019 Plans: APOLLO - FY 2019 plans continue efforts as outlined in FY 2018 to collect 1,000 cancer specimens (all cancer types) and run them though the DNA, RNA, and protein molecular analysis lab platforms of USU, and perform initial data analytics on the results.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: DoD Cancer Moonshot Program - DoD Framingham Longitudinal Study Description: DoD Framingham is a novel project that is enabled by the blood serum specimens stored at the DoD Serum Repository at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) in Silver Spring, Maryland. This facility stores blood serum drawn from over 10 million ADSMs who were required to undergo mandatory semiannual blood testing for the last 25 years, resulting in this repository with over 65 million blood serum specimens. MCC tumor registry data, which includes every ADSM who developed cancer while on active duty, is matched to data in the Serum Repository. This allows MCC to identify the blood serum of ADSMs who ultimately develop cancer at key times, i.e., before they had cancer, during their cancer treatment, and after their successful cancer treatment. Four different serum specimens (two before, one during, and one after cancer diagnosis and treatment) from every ADSM who developed certain types of cancer over a ten-year period of time are then sent to the Nation's foremost protein identification (mass spectroscopy) center, i.e., the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) run by the Department of Energy (DOE). This enables identification of the entire proteome circulating in the blood serum of these cancer patients before, during, and after cancer diagnosis. Comparing the proteomes will allow for identification of new protein biomarkers and indicators of treatment response and failure both of individual patients and across all patients with a specific type of cancer. Smaller studies of this nature done by MCC researchers have proven that this is an effective strategy to identify novel diagnostic and treatment protein expression biomarkers that can be assayed in new blood tests for cancer.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The primary goal of the VLER Health initiative is to enable the secure sharing of health information (i.e., demographic and clinical data) between DoD and external Federal and private sector partners which meets Meaningful Use (MU) requirements to improve healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency. By electronically sharing health information using national standards, that information can support tracking key clinical conditions, communicating that information to better coordinate care, and engaging patients in their own care. The VLER Health initiative provides clinicians with the most up-to-date information, potentially reducing redundant diagnostic tests, medical errors, paperwork and handling, and overall healthcare costs. These benefits, in turn, align with the MHS quadruple aim by ensuring that the military force is medically ready to deploy; the military beneficiary population remains healthy through focused prevention; patient care is convenient, equitable, safe, and of the highest quality; and the total cost of healthcare is reduced through the reduction of waste and focus on quality. VLER Health funding will be reflected in the Integrated Electronic Health Record Program Element 0605023 in FY 2014 and out. B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification In FY2019, PASTOR name changed to Patient Reported Outcomes Clinical Record (PROCR). A Clinical Decision Support tool to facilitate clinical management and optimize patient care by providing clinicians the ability to track patient reported outcome data as patients proceed through the clinical continuum of care. The need for standardized clinical assessments extended to business process improvements, clinical decision support, and individual and population-based outcome improvements by using validated instruments to measure patient reported outcomes and clinical treatment data in the routine delivery of care. PROCR leverages computer adaptive testing scales of the National Institutes of Health Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System to fulfill two essential clinical needs: (1) seamless communication of assessment results in an actionable manner and (2) data repository for clinical research and health utilization studies. Capabilities focus on two care communities: pain-related psychosocial factors & treatment history; and musculoskeletal (MSK) health. PROCR helps meet the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) recommendation for \"performance measures used to determine the effectiveness of the policy in improving pain care for beneficiaries enrolled in the military health care system.\".

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Legacy Data Repository (LDR) will provide the strategy, analysis, and solution to assume data management and governance for legacy Clinical and Business data for Defense Health Agency's Solutions Delivery Division systems that will be decommissioned as the Military Health System (MHS) Genesis electronic health record is deployed. As MHS Genesis deploys to each site, legacy systems cannot decommission without a legacy data repository to safely and securely migrate data - absence a LDR solution negates and ignores the underlying requirement. Clinicians without access to legacy patient history can create a direct patient safety issue. The legacy component of a patient's Legal Medical Record will no longer be accessible once MHS Genesis rolls out. LDR will identify, capture, organize, disseminate, and synthesize required legacy data needed to support medical information requirements for Business Intelligence (BI), Continuity of Care, and Archival in support of Defense Health Modernization Systems (DHMS) deployment plans, legacy system decommissioning plans, and operations and sustainment activities within their areas of responsibility. This initial investment would allow the MHS to realize cost savings by decommissioning systems with overlapping capabilities to MHS Genesis, and reduce the legacy system footprint across the enterprise. Further, LDR would make legacy data available for clinicians through a clinical viewer to compliment the longitudinal record of MHS Genesis. This project will enable clinicians to holistically view a service member's medical record through both MHS Genesis and a legacy viewer. Downstream system dependent on legacy data would also be benefited through a persistence of this information. As the LDR takes responsibility for legacy data, it must be retained within a flexible, scalable, and cost effective platform, but must also maintain the discipline of existing MHS data governance and management standards. While meeting these data governance and management standards, legacy data will be maintained in a variety of formats and degrees of normalization and structuring (i.e. discrete data, document, object, and file level).

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Purpose: Establish a unified MHS program to augment military medicine with robust 'anywhere' virtual health capabilities. The program will include three distinct capabilities in order to meet its initial expected business outcome. The first capability will incorporate secure clinical VTC (synchronous visits) to enable a provider in one location to offer diagnosis and treatment to a patient in another location. Synchronous visits can take place between a provider and patient at different MTFs, or at the patient's location (e.g. their home or other location deemed appropriate by the provider). Synchronous visits at the patient's location can be conducted for primary or specialty care. Primary and Specialty Care appointments via synchronous visits will enable health care anytime, anywhere. The second capability incorporates an Asynchronous secure portal or teleconsultation portal, to enable a pool of specialty care providers globally to deliver timely clinical advice, primarily in operational settings where expertise is scarce, but also in garrison when needed. The portal facilitates 'store and forward' transmission of electronic medical information and associated digital images between health care providers. Specialty clinicians provide expert advice and guidance to the patient's attending physicians, assisting them in the disposition or local treatment options. The third capability is remote health monitoring, to collect, track, and transmit biometric data from the patient via a secure portal to an MTF. The data is accessed by a care coordinator or health care provider at the MTF to provide real-time medical interventions that can improve a patient's health and quality of life. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Military Health (MHS VHP) Description: GOAL: The MHS VHP will connect our beneficiaries to health care globally to increase readiness, access, quality, and patient safety. BENEFIT: Using VH, the best of MHS Medicine across the world can be brought to the patient wherever they are - deployed or in garrison. As a modality without geographic limits, VH extends access to quality primary care, behavioral health, and medical specialty care to remote locations where beneficiaries may be geographically separated from comprehensive Military Treatment Facility (MTF) based care, and where such care is not readily available in the surrounding community. Additionally, VH can help the MHS use its clinical capacity more effectively; cross-leveraging clinical expertise when and where it is needed.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification DHMSM will acquire and support deployment, and implementation of an electronic health record (EHR) system that replaces the DoD legacy MHS inpatient and outpatient EHR systems. Overarching goal of the program is to enable healthcare teams to deliver high-quality, safe care and preventive services to patients through the use of easily accessible standards-based computerized patient records resulting in: improved accuracy of diagnoses and medication; improved impact on health outcomes; increased patient participation in the healthcare process; improved patient-centered care coordination; and increased practice efficiencies in all settings, including operational environments. DHMSM replaces DoD legacy healthcare systems with a commercial solution in use in other medical systems that is open, rendered as a modular architecture, using standards-based/non-proprietary interfaces. DHMSM will support the Department's goals of net centricity by providing a framework for full human and technical connectivity and interoperability that allows DoD users and mission partners to share the information they need, when they need it, in a form they can understand and act on with confidence, and protects information from those who should not have it. Once fielded, the EHR will support the following healthcare activities for DoD's 44,000 practitioners and 9.5 million beneficiaries. 1. Clinical workflow and provider clinical decision support; 2. Capture, maintain, use, protect, preserve and share health data and information; 3. Retrieval and presentation of health data and information that is meaningful for EHR users regardless of where the patient's records are physically maintained; and 4. Analysis and management of health information from multiple perspectives to include population health, military medical readiness, clinical quality, disease management, and medical research. B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification In March 2008, the MHS embarked upon Electronic Health Record (EHR) modernization planning, establishing the initial Electronic Health Records Way Ahead (EHRWA). In March 2011, the Program was expanded to include the VA in a joint initiative to implement a new, integrated electronic health record for both Departments, called the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program. Secretary Hagel's Memorandum titled \"Integrated Electronic Health Records,\" dated May 2013, provided additional direction to the program: DoD shall continue near-term coordinated efforts with VA to develop data federation, presentation, and interoperability. This near-term goal shall be pursued as a first priority separately from the longer-term goal of health record information technology (IT) modernization. DoD shall pursue a full and open competition for a core set of capabilities for EHR modernization. To fulfill Secretary Hagel's directive, parallel programs have been defined, splitting the original iEHR program into two distinct areas. In the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) Acquisition Decision Memoranda (ADM), dated June 21, 2013 and January 2, 2014, the former joint DoD and VA Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program was restructured to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program and a newly defined iEHR focused on providing seamless integrated sharing of electronic health data between the DoD and VA to be called Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX). The remaining iEHR Increment 1 (iEHR Inc 1) was significantly de-scoped to only the Medical Single Sign-on/Context management (MSSO/CM) implemented at James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (JAL FHCC). DMIX established a roadmap outlining the future of health data sharing and viewer capabilities for DoD in support of the guidance provided by the President, Congress, and the Secretary of Defense. The roadmap defined a plan to provide a single viewer to be used by DoD and VA that displays an integrated view of a patient's medical history. The viewer leverages existing inherited DoD data-sharing capabilities, and a VA-provided data service in order to collect the patient's health data from the respective, authoritative data stores. Of the various existing viewers, VA and DoD decided to evolve Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) as the single viewer for use by both Departments. By adopting JLV as a common viewer between DoD and VA, DMIX met the National Defense Authorization Act FY 2014 (NDAA 2014) requirement for \"an integrated display of data\" which allows DoD to sunset inherited legacy viewers.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification DMIX program will acquire the capabilities necessary to securely and reliably exchange standardized, normalized, and correlated health data with all partners through standard data/information exchange mechanisms. This allows users in different places and different organizations to access, use, and supplement health data (technical interoperability) that has a shared meaning so users (assisted by computers) are able to make care decisions (Semantic Interoperability - Level 4). DMIX manages the data exchange capability from legacy data stores in order to prepare for the transition to the modernized Electronic Health Record platform being acquired by DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM). DMIX consists of a family of capability initiatives supporting the seamless exchange of standardized health data among DoD, VA, other Federal agencies, and private providers as well as benefits administrators. The DMIX program provides the capability for health care providers to access and view complete and accurate patient health records from a variety of data sources thereby allowing healthcare providers to make faster and higher quality care decisions. DMIX was established in accordance with the joint memo from USD(C) and USD(AT&L) titled \"Joint Memorandum on Major Defense Acquisition Program and Major Automated Information System Program Resource Transparency in Department of Defense Budget Systems\" dated June 27, 2013. In addition, Joint Electronic Health Record Interoperability (JEHRI) and Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Health (to include Exchange) are part of the DMIX program as a direct result of the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed January 2, 2014 by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistic (USD AT&L). Use of the health data may be done via legacy systems, clinical mobile applications and system agnostic viewers such as the Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV). Customers include the MHS, VA, other federal agencies and over 200,000 medical care practitioners. B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program was established in the Defense Health Program (DHP), Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriation during FY 2001, and is funded in the year of execution. The objective of the DHP SBIR Program includes stimulating technological innovation, strengthening the role of small business in meeting Department of Defense (DoD) research and development needs, fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increasing the commercial application of DoD-supported research and development results. The program funds small business proposals chosen to enhance military medical research and information technology research. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program was established in the DHP, RDT&E appropriation during FY 2015, and is funded in the year of execution. The STTR Program, although modeled substantially on the SBIR Program, is a separate program and is separately financed. Central to the program is expansion of the public/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small businesses and nonprofit research institutions. The unique feature of the STTR program is the requirement for the small business to formally collaborate with a research institution in Phase I and Phase II. STTR's most important role is to bridge the gap between performance of basic science and commercialization of resulting innovations. The mission of the STTR program is to support scientific excellence and technological innovation through the investment of Federal research funds in critical American priorities to build a strong national economy. The programs' goals are to stimulate technological innovation, foster technology transfer through cooperative research and development between small businesses and research institutions, and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal research and development. Both the SBIR and STTR programs address the President's multi-agency science and technology priority of innovation in life sciences, biology, and neuroscience through coordination with the Joint Program Committees, which manage multi-Service DHP-sponsored research.

Performance Metrics Performance is measured based on the number of products for which testing either certifies use in a given environment (e.g., sufficiently ruggedized, airworthiness testing) and/or results in a recommendation of a specific product, and delivery of an enhanced product. The benchmark performance metric for research supported in this PE will be the enhancement of a maturity level that is typical of TRL 9.

Description of Operations Supported: Provides resources needed to fund the incremental (above baseline) costs to support Operation FREEDOM'S SENTINEL (OFS) in Afghanistan, Operation INHERENT RESOLVE (OIR) in Iraq and the Levant, increasing efforts to support European allies and deter aggression (European Reassurance Initiative), and supporting a partnership- focused approach to counterterrorism. The resource amounts provided are consistent with the Department's force level budgetary assumptions. These incremental funds provide medical and dental services to active forces, mobilized Reserve Components (RC), and their family members in support of these operations. The Defense Health Program (DHP) baseline budget request does not fund the medical and dental support requirements within the Area of Responsibility (AOR). Other DHP operational requirements in support of these operations include: Pre/Post deployment processing for personnel, aeromedical transportation of casualties from Germany to the U.S., and contracted civilian medical personnel to backfill deployed permanent Military Treatment Facility (MTF) staff. Additional support requirements include telemedicine for theater and post deployment health assessments (between 3- 6 months after deployment). The Defense Health Program's FY 2020 Overseas Contingency Operations funding supports the following category: OCO for Direct War Costs ($347,746K): Direct War costs are those combat or direct combat support costs that will not continue to be expended once combat operations end at major contingency locations. In House Care: - Incremental costs for deployment related prophylactic pharmaceuticals - Backfill of deployed permanent medical personnel Private Sector Care - Healthcare for mobilized RC and their family members Consolidated Health Support - Aeromedical transportation of casualties from Germany to the US Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget Estimates Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Exhibit OP -5 - DHP OCO, Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group DHP-534 II. Financial Summary: ($ in Thousands) OCO: FY War Costs: 347,746 A. Subactivity Group - In-House Care: Enacted Request 69,287 72,627 57,459 Narrative Justification: Funding in this budget activity group directly supports pre/post deployment activities such as medical records reviews, hearing and vision exams, medical evaluations, immunizations and behavioral health screening for all deploying and returning soldiers. Funding also supports backfill of deployed personnel with medical staff to sustain the delivery of patient care in Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Decrease from FY 2019 to FY 2020 is the result of the Service's efforts to identify and fund enduring activities in the baseline budget. Impact if not funded: The Military Treatment Facilities' (MTFs') primary mission is to provide healthcare to uniformed service personnel. Funding is required to provide medical and dental care Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget Estimates Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Exhibit OP -5 - DHP OCO, Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group DHP-535 for the mobilized forces not funded in the baseline budget. Without this funding MTFs would have to reduce access to care for non- active duty beneficiaries (retirees and family members) resulting in disengagement of these beneficiaries to the private sector for healthcare services. If funding is not provided to backfill the healthcare positions vacated in the MTFs by deployed medical personnel, components will have to redirect funding from other direct care system requirements to sustain the continuity of healthcare to patients. Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget Estimates Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Exhibit OP -5 - DHP OCO, Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group DHP-536 A. Subactivity Group - Private Sector Care: 287,487 Narrative Justification: Funding provides Reserve Component (RC) personnel and their family members with healthcare, pharmacy and dental benefits. Mobilized RC personnel and their family members are eligible for medical and dental similar to active duty personnel, including access to private sector care providers through the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contract (MCSC) provider networks. This access to MCSC provider networks also supports those beneficiaries living in remote locations outside the established network areas. TRICARE Reserve Select program, offered to RC members who enroll and share premiums with the government, is not included in this requirement. Impact if not funded: Providing healthcare to mobilized RC personnel and their families is congressionally mandated. This is a must- pay bill and the cost will be incurred regardless of the availability of funding. If funding is not provided, lower priority healthcare requirements will be delayed so that funding can be shifted to pay for the healthcare services.

Suba ctivity Group - Consolidated Health Support : FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Actuals Enacted Request 4,601 2,375 2,800 Narrative Justification: Requirements in this budget activity group directly support the transportation of wounded warriors by aircraft from outside the theater of operations to the United States, the resupply of medical evacuation equipment, and ground transportation for patients outside of the theater. Projections for deployed active and reserve component forces in FY 2020 contribute to an increase in the overall requirement. Impact if not funded: Aeromedical transport missions would require additional internal funding offsets such as delays in infrastructure improvements and equipment or supply procurement.
