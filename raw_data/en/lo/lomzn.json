Allergies can prevent you from enjoying the full range of your daily activities and create unwanted stress in your life. The many benefits of allergy treatments have been well-documented in the industries of allergy-related health; however, a recent discovery uncovered another surprising benefit of allergy treatment. A type of vaccine called BM32 has traditionally been used to treat grass pollen allergies. This vaccine is based on the recombinant peptide-carrier technology, which is noted as having far fewer side effects than average [allergy shots](https://www.centerforallergyandsinus.com/allergy-services/immunotherapy/). In order for the vaccine to properly protect against grass pollen, it must be administered three to four times per year. Caroline Cornelius was working on her doctoral thesis at MedUni Vienna when she made an interesting discovery regarding the BM32 vaccine. Cornelius realized that individuals who had not previously received the conventional hepatitis B vaccine but did receive a BM32 vaccination achieved an 80 percent lower rate of infection from the hepatitis B virus. Cornelius is also hopeful that the active ingredient in BM32 could lead to improvements in the treatment of chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis is one of the most widespread health conditions across the globe, and as many as 3 percent of the world's global population suffer from the virus. Of those who have received the common hepatitis vaccines, as many as 10 percent are unable to build up sufficient antibodies to protect themselves from possible infection.
