See page 209.189 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 6 | july/August 2020189 editorials As I craft this editorial in early May, my heartfelt congratulations go out to the people of BC as their sacrifices have flattened the curve of this COVID-19 pandemic. By suffering through financial and social hardship, our province did not experience thousands of ill patients with significant mor- tality as did so many other places in the world. I fear the next stage of the pandemic might be the most challenging. So many choices need to be made on how to proceed in reopening businesses, schools, gatherings, etc. The president of the United States has just suggested ingesting disinfectants and using light therapy. He has blamed China for the pandemic and suggested SARS-CoV-2 leaked from a Wuhan laboratory. He has praised armed protestors rallying against federal safety guide- lines for reopening economies while at the same time criticizing governors of other states for not minding these same rules. He has just an-nounced Operation Warp Speed to fast-track a vaccine without any real knowledge of what that entails. He is the gift that keeps on giving. Despite the death rate in the US ticking along at 2000 per day, many states are reopening their economies. Georgia has recently given the COVID 20/20 4 May 2020 green light to gyms, hair salons, barbershops, and tattoo parlors. I can understand the need to exercise and deal with quarantine shagginess, but why is getting a tattoo a priority? I realize many people are impatient to get back to nor-mal, whatever that will look like, but I would suggest a more careful approach. I trust that our pro- vincial authorities will proceed with caution us- ing the best information available at each decision point. However, this re- mains extremely tricky. If opening too soon results in a second wave of cases, harsh judgment will fol- low. Dragging the process along with no adverse outcomes will likely be equally condemned. In the months and years to come, retro- spection will show if the approach taken to managing the pandemic in our province was the correct one. Was our initial approach of limiting testing to certain populations the cor- rect path, or should we have mirrored South Korea's massive testing protocol? Were physical distancing and mass closures in our best inter- est, or should we have followed Sweden's model, which kept businesses open and isolated only the vulnerable in their population? Will areas that reopen quickly end up in a better place in a few months, or will they be mired in a sec- ond wave while our steady plodding saves lives? I for one am glad that I do not have to guide the course of our recovery. By the time this edi- torial is published this summer, the path of this dangerous virus will likely be clearer. It will be easy to point our collective finger and judge those burdened with this thankless responsibility, but I for one will not be casting any stones. Instead, I would ask for understanding of the difficult decisions made and compassion for those forced to make them along the way. n \u2014David R.

The sheer amount of information can be overwhelming; every news channel and website is filled with data on the number of cases, number of deaths, number of ICU admissions, and number of government restrictions and guidelines. What the future holds may seem grim. However, one thing that has struck me dur - ing this pandemic is how, through hardship, the positive aspects of human nature\u2014kindness and resilience\u2014shine through. It shows glimpses of hope in this challenging battle with the virus. In this trying time, it is vital to treat everyone with kindness. We may not know what someone else has experienced during the pandemic. They may have lost their job or have a loved one af- fected by the illness, fighting for their life in the hospital. We've each had our own experiences, but one thing we can all aim to achieve is to spread kindness. I've learned about medical students whose clerkship experiences have been affected but who have chosen to use their time to help health care workers with groceries and Finding kindness and resilience during a pandemic for new hobbies to take up, or options for hold- ing virtual gatherings. The current limitations have also given us the opportunity to cherish connections with our family and friends. I am also immensely proud of my colleagues and other health care workers who exemplify re- silience. They go to work, day in and day out, to keep us all safe despite being presented with unknown challenges, especially dur- ing the early days of the pandemic. Not many of us, before now, could have said they lived through a pandemic. It has not been an easy journey, but I think we have all learned and gained a lot from this experience. We have learned things about ourselves. It has given us a chance to reflect on the present and what we often take for granted. I hope it is the acts of kindness and resilience that will be this pan- demic's lasting legacy. n \u2014Yvonne Sin, MD child care. I've learned about restaurants provid- ing and delivering free meals to thank health care workers. There are, of course, the health care workers who are going above and beyond to spread kindness to their patients\u2014nurses setting up FaceTime for their dy- ing patients to see family one last time, or doctors providing reassurance and care to patients who are fighting this illness. We have learned that we are in this pandemic for the long haul. It has now been months since the first case in BC. However, the fact that we find the strength to physically and mentally cope with this crisis speaks to our resilience. We have all made changes to our daily lives.

I took up this post as I believed in Doctors of BC's or-ganizational vision (expressed in the Strategic Framework: www.doctorsofbc.ca/sites/default/ files/strategicframeworkbooklet2018-2023.pdf ) and our purpose statement: \"Better Together. Making a Difference for BC Doctors.\" While these proclamations may at first blush seem to be quite lofty or high-level, the intention behind them colors and drives our organization's work every single day. These times are truly unprecedented. Who could have predicted how nimble our health care system needed to become to address the SARS-CoV-2 crisis, or just how quickly new models of care would need to evolve to protect patients and front-line providers? I would argue that Doctors of BC was ready, and I recently reflected on our Strategic Framework to try and understand why this was the case. Over the last decade, Doctors of BC laid the strong foundation we needed to weather this crisis. Our professional organization has invest- ed time and financial resources into building an engaged and connected physician membership that could make the necessary adjustments in a timely fashion. Mr Allan Seckel, our CEO, envisioned our strategic framework as a set of stairs, beginning with the first step of understanding our doc- tors and the environment in which they work. Establishing divisions of family practice and medical staff associations in conjunction with our government partners, via the joint standing committees, left us uniquely poised to under- stand where barriers exist to achieving optimal patient care at a grassroots level. These strong, independent, yet closely linked organizations lead the crucial work required across BC's di-verse medical communities. Engaging with our doctors and assisting them in raising concerns with the health care system at large, established the trusted chan- nels of communication needed to fight this pandemic. Physicians' voices were empowered, respected, and heard prior to the onset of this crisis. Our profession was already develop- ing a modern and innovative system, which prioritized the most optimal patient experi - ences. The development supported timely ac- cess to care, patient choice, and longitudinal, relationship-based primary care. Our doctors and their health care admin- istrator counterparts were already working to- gether, collaborating to improve the quality of patient care. We were beginning to hear the voices of our patients and caregivers lead some of these conversations on equal footing with those who treat, and those who support treat-ment. We were ensuring an effective relation- ship between Doctors of BC, government, and each of the health authorities, built on mutual understanding between physician leaders and the needs of the health care system at large. Members of Doctors of BC understood that one of our organization's key priorities was serving them and assisting them with benefits, services, and personal- and practice-level sup- ports. There has never before been a time when our members have needed more support to change practice models, payment models, IT and security platforms, and business practices as a whole. The Doctor's Technology Office was already a well-known resource, and it was able to step forward and assist physicians in changing quickly. Our joint standing commit- tees quickly developed new fee codes to reflect the new reality of practice. The well-established collaborative channels smoothed the way for the government to adopt these changes to improve patients' access to necessary care. Finally, Doctors of BC has played a tre- mendous role in advocating for our members to ensure strong public confidence in our medical profession through actions such as promoting public health and safety matters since the very beginning. The public was prepared to look to physicians as the source of truth and under- standing in a time of so much misinformation. When our provincial health officers and many of our members told the public to stay home and physically distance themselves, it meant something powerful. Patients looked to us for accurate information to keep them safe and to ensure that they could still access the care they needed when our hospitals stood half empty to prepare for the surge. So, as I reflect on the strength of our pro- fession through these exceptional times, I must relay tremendous gratitude to every physician, and all Doctors of BC staff who have poured so much of their energy into empowering our or- ganization. We came into this crisis well poised to succeed and I believe we have. Our future will be very different, and physicians are again uniquely poised to lead the evolution of our health care system to better meet the needs of patients, families, caregivers, and physicians. We are no longer shouting into the wind; we are soaring. n \u2014Kathleen Ross, MD Doctors of BC President193 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 6 | july/August 2020193 Resources for COVID-19 Doctors of BC is actively supporting members during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in a variety of ways.

Research shows that health care professionals working on the frontlines of the pandemic have reported symp- toms of mental health conditions.1 Treating COVID-19 patients comes with heavy emo- tional demands, but research about the impact of these demands on our health care profession- als' physical, mental, and emotional well-being has only just begun.1 Mental health should become less taboo; the focus should shift and we all need to understand that it is a shared re- sponsibility between individuals and the system. The health and well-being of our physicians is very important by itself; however, it is essential to recognize the downstream impacts of our physicians' health. Specifically, the well-being of our physicians reflects and impacts the care that their patients receive.2 Hence, ensuring the optimal health and well-being of our phy-sicians is of utmost importance for our society as a whole.

However, there should also be resources allocated for systemic factors that, in addition to COVID-19, are detrimental to the well-being of physicians.3 Some of these systemic factors include lack of work-life bal-ance, challenges with electronic health record systems, and work compression.3 Resources that address systems-level factors that negatively contribute to the health of physicians can pro- vide even more support to help our physicians achieve optimal health and well-being. Teach- ing individuals resilience is not sufficient, and promoting health and well-being of health care providers should be treated as very important because it will improve the overall efficiency of our health care system. The Doctors of BC resource page provides a contact email for the physician health steer- ing committee; physicians can use this email to suggest what supports they truly need for their wellness.4 We commend Doctors of BC's efforts and we believe that by listening to physi - cians in BC, we open up the floor to hear what our care providers need and thus we can take a multifaceted approach in supporting BC's phy - sicians. It should be noted that 81% of physi-cians and residents surveyed recently said that they were aware of physician health program services available to them, yet only 15% had accessed them.5 Therefore, increasing awareness of Doctors of BC's new health and wellness services and making every effort to eliminate cultural and institutional barriers to access these programs is very necessary. During these challenging times, it is of paramount importance to promote and facili-tate hospital environments that enhance phy- sicians' sense of fulfillment and engagement. Promoting values and cultural norms to respect our colleagues' mental health well-being is in- deed a shared responsibility, and there is an urgent need to address stigma around physi - cian health and wellness issues within hospital environments. We need to create tools to fa- cilitate help-seeking behavior through promot- ing positive organization culture. This cannot be achieved unless we are ready to deploy our sincere effort and appropriately reinforce these attitudes with sufficient resources to address the barriers that prevent physicians from seeking help and intervention. references 1.

Mr Dhinsa and colleagues are to be commended for this infor- mative article highlighting some of the clinical challenges in diagnosing osteosarcoma or Ew- ing sarcoma in children. However, I take offence with the statement, \"increased awareness could reduce delays.\" Every patient I see as a family physician (not a general practitioner, which is not a term that should be used in a BCMJ article in 2020) may harbor a life-threatening illness. Is that chest pain unstable angina or a muscle strain? Is that difficulty swallowing reflux or an early esophageal cancer? Is that knee pain growing pains or cancer? The patient journey illustrated diagnostic and treatment delays partly due to multiple visits to walk-in clinics, not necessarily a lack of awareness among family physicians. Was the patient's family physician sent a copy of the patient's visit after each walk-in clinic visit? Was it the same walk-in clinic that was visited? Was the patient advised to follow up with his or her family physician? I, along with my family physician colleagues, fear missing significant diagnoses\u2014especially in children. Awareness is important, but what is more critical is longitudinal care and com- munication between providers to ensure that each patient journey map brings the patient the care he or she needs in the most expeditious fashion possible. \u2014Tahmeena Ali, MD, CCFP , FCFP Surrey196 BC MediC al Journal vol. 6 | July/August 2020196 CliniC al Derin Karacabeyli, MD, Stephanie Shea, MPH, Keidar, MPH, Susan Pinkney, MA, Katrina Bepple, BSc, MD, MScPH The Live 5-2-1-0 Toolkit for family physicians: Mixed methods evaluation of a resource to facilitate health promotion in a primary care setting A pilot study in two BC communities found that a toolkit promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors helped FPs initiate discussions about pediatric obesity with patients and develop plans for monitoring.

As part of this initiative, an intervention using the Live 5-2- 1-0 Toolkit for family physicians (FPs) was piloted in two communities. This study aimed to identify barriers and aids to toolkit implementation, and to determine whether the toolkit improves physicians' capacity to promote healthy childhood behaviors. Methods: FPs completed preintervention and post- intervention surveys and participated in semi- structured interviews after implementation of the Live 5-2-1-0 Toolkit intervention. Implementation occurred sequentially in two communities and involved a total of 21 FPs in six primary care clinics. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data, and content analysis was used for qualita- tive data.Results: Of the 21 participating FPs, 14 completed the preintervention and the postintervention sur - veys (67%) and 7 completed the preintervention survey only (33%). FPs reported increased knowl- edge of medical evaluation of pediatric patients with obesity (from 14% preintervention to 36% postintervention), behavioral goal setting (from 36% 93%), and motivational interviewing (from 57% to 79%). FPs' perceived efficacy in addressing the subject of weight improved (from 43% preinter - vention to 93% postintervention). Increases were also observed in routinely addressing nutrition (from 43% preintervention to 79% postinterven- tion), physical activity (from 50% 79%), screen time (from 14% to 64%), and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (from 29% to 71%). As a result of toolkit implementation, 71% of FPs felt their patients were more aware of long-term com- plications related to lifestyle, 64% felt patients were more willing to set behavioral goals with provid-ers, and 50% felt patients were more able to self- manage issues related to lifestyle. The predominant barrier to implementation was lack of staff/clinic capacity to measure BMI; the most noted aid to implementation was access to ready-to-use Live 5-2-1-0 resources.The Live 5-2-1-0 Toolkit for family physicians197 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 6 | july/August 2020197 CliniC alConclusions: The Live 5-2-1-0 Toolkit facilitated health promotion to pediatric patients in the pri- mary care setting. Increasing routine BMI measure - ment in primary care remains challenging due to clinical capacity issues. Results of this pilot study will be used to refine the toolkit prior to wider dissemination across British Columbia. Background The prevalence of childhood obesity continues to increase in Canada and worldwide, posing a major public health challenge.1,2 Childhood obesity is complex, with several factors con- tributing to an obesogenic environment (e.g., exposure to energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods, limited physical activity opportunities, and increased screen time/sedentary activity).3 The 2015 Lancet series on obesity described patchy progress in prevention globally.4 How - ever, whole-of-community, multisetting, mul- tistrategy interventions have shown promise in achieving population-level reductions in child- hood overweight and obesity across the globe.5-9 These interventions engage with the complexity of childhood obesity and address the various components of the obesogenic environment at several levels, thereby facilitating tailored, community-centric local action.10 Sustainable Childhood Obesity Prevention Through Com- munity Engagement (SCOPE) is a Canadi- an example of such an intervention. SCOPE partners with communities to empower lo- cal stakeholders across multiple sectors (e.g., schools, media, businesses, health services, com- munity/recreation centres, local governments) to share (via social marketing) and support (via policy, practice, and environmental change) the evidence-based Live-5-2-1-0 message: 5 vegetables and fruits every day. 2 hours at most of recreational screen time a day. 1 hour at least of physical activity each day. 0 sugar-sweetened beverages each day.11,12 Primary care serves as an ideal setting for monitoring children's weight trajectories and addressing health behaviors/habits given the long-standing relationship between family phy- sicians and families.13 However, primary care physicians have reported barriers to promoting healthy weights, including lack of self-efficacy, capacity, resources (e.g., staffing support and educational materials/counseling tools), and time.14-17 The SCOPE team worked with two com- munities to create, use, adapt, and evaluate the Live 5-2-1-0 Toolkit for family physicians (FPs) to address these barriers and empower primary care providers to promote healthy behaviors and weights. The toolkit, discussed in greater detail under Methods, integrates routine BMI track- ing and growth monitoring, training on moti- vational interviewing, and resources to support assessment and discussion of healthy behaviors and facilitation of community program refer-rals. The objectives of our pilot study were to: 1. Determine whether the toolkit improved physicians' capacity to promote healthy childhood behaviors. 2. Identify barriers and aids to toolkit imple - mentation. Methods The Live 5-2-1-0 Toolkit intervention was implemented in one urban and one rural com- munity, both of which were existing SCOPE partner communities with primary care leader- ship involvement. Community A, population 80 000, is a city in British Columbia's Fraser Valley, located 105 km east of Vancouver, the province's largest urban centre. Community B, population 6600, is a rural community located in the Kootenay Rockies region of BC. Participants Family practice clinics in communities A and B were selected using convenience sampling, and were contacted by a member of the research team to gauge the clinics' collective interest in participating in the study. Individual FPs in clinics that expressed interest were then invited to participate; participating FPs were required to have a current primary care practice in either community A or B, and participation was vol- untary. In total, 21 FPs from six primary care clinics participated. A small sample size was accepted because this pilot study's purpose was to evaluate feasibility of toolkit implementation in the clinical setting and inform toolkit refine- ment prior to larger-scale evaluation. Study design A preintervention and postintervention obser - vational mixed methods study design was used. Data were collected from participating FPs before and after the intervention (9 months during 2014 in community A, and 12 months during 2015-16 in community B) using a sur- vey adapted from the Maine Youth Overweight Collaborative's \"Keep ME Healthy\" initiative18 that could be completed via an online link or on paper. Participants were guaranteed ano- nymity to reduce social desirability bias. To measure physicians' capacity to promote healthy childhood behaviors, survey questions assessed physicians' knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and practices pertaining to BMI measurement, management of pediatric overweight and obe- sity, and discussion of healthy lifestyle behav-iors. Physician demographic data were also collected. The intervention and surveys were first implemented in community A, and were subsequently modified based on lessons learned prior to implementation in community B. All participating FPs were invited to com- plete a postintervention, semi-structured, in-person qualitative interview, approximately 20 to 30 minutes in length and conducted by a SCOPE researcher, to explore barriers and aids to project implementation and to elicit suggestions for improving the toolkit and im- plementation processes [Table 1, next page]. Quantitative data derived from the surveys informed the qualitative interview questions related to changes in FP practice, observed be- havior change among patients, barriers and aids to project implementation, project sustainability, toolkit usefulness, and overall project impact. Intervention The toolkit intervention was based on recom- mendations by Barlow,19 and was consistent with recent recommendations on childhood obesity management and prevention in the primary care setting.20 Key components of the intervention included the following: 1. Integrating routine BMI tracking and growth monitoring as an obesity preven - tion strategy. Growth monitoring/BMI tracking has been strongly recommended by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care given its low cost, feasibility, low probability of harm, and potential value in early identification of weight-related health conditions. 20Karacabeyli D, Shea S, Keidar S, Pinkney S, Bepple K, Edwards D, Hale I, Suleman S, Amed S198 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 6 | July/August 2020198 CliniC al 2. Training on motivational interviewing as a patient-centred counseling technique that allows individuals to discover their own reasons for change. A number of random - ized control trials on motivational inter - viewing in the primary care setting have illustrated its promise in eliciting positive behavior change21,22 and reducing BMI in overweight pediatric patients.23 3. Providing tools and resources to support assessment and discussion of daily habits and lifestyle behaviors, and to facilitate community program referral through pri - mary care in order to link affordable and available resources/services to individuals who may need additional support beyond that available through their family phy - sician. Lack of available resources and community supports has frequently been described as a barrier for physicians at - tempting to address childhood obesity in the primary care setting.16,24 The toolkit intervention was implemented through an expert-led group training session for physicians and clinic staff. The training ses- sion was 2 hours and consisted of three pre- sentations: (1) how to conduct motivational interviewing, conducted by a child psychologist, (2) how to respectfully discuss weight during patient interactions, conducted by the primary investigator, and (3) how to use the binder of toolkit elements and resources, conducted by the research manager. The toolkit binder included resources on employing motivational interviewing tech- niques, a flow chart on managing children with overweight or obesity (i.e., appropriate labo- ratory investigations and referral to relevant community- or hospital-based programs), and instructions for integrating World Health Organization growth charts and BMI mea- surements into an electronic medical record. Further, the toolkit binder included additional resources such as the Live 5-2-1-0 Healthy Habits Questionnaire to assess current behav- iors, a community-specific Healthy Living Sup- port Booklet that identified local and provincial programs that support healthy behaviors to which patients could be referred, and supple- mentary Live 5-2-1-0 resources such as pre- scription pads, fact sheets, posters, magnets, and goal-tracking tools. The elements of the toolkit binder are available online at www.live5210.ca/ resources/health. Data analysis Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the University of British Columbia Children's and Women's Health Centre of British Colum- bia Research Ethics Board. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze quantitative data (propor- tions, means, and frequencies). Semi-structured interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Directed content analysis was used to generate preliminary coding categories;25 a cod- ing guide was generated by two researchers (SS, SP) who then independently reviewed all the transcripts before deliberating and finalizing the coding guide. A third researcher (SA) reviewed the transcripts independently using the finalized coding guide, after which all three researchers worked together to resolve inconsistencies. Key themes and subthemes were then identified. Results Of the 21 participating FPs, 14 completed the preintervention and the postintervention surveys (67%) and 7 completed the preinter- vention survey only (33%). Six FPs from com- munity A also completed postintervention semi-structured interviews (28%). The demo- graphic and practice characteristics of survey respondents indicated that physicians who did not complete the postintervention survey were disproportionately male and younger than those who did [Table 2].

The Live 5-2-1-0 message facilitates prac - tice change. FPs found the explain,\" and \"a and a common ground to go on\" (FP1, FP2). FPs felt that the Live 5-2-1-0 message helped destigmatize discussions on healthy living and empowered physicians to be pro - active with health promotion. The mes - sage allowed them to \"open the discussion in a nonjudgmental way\" (FP1) because it was \"standardized\" (FP6), and they were \"doing this to all kids,\" which \"takes away the stigma associated with obesity\" (FP1). Another physician said that the resources \"made [them] far more proactive and there - fore preventative,\" and provided them \"more leverage as a physician to open that conver - which, otherwise, [they]. (FP5). One physician said, \"I know what to do now when I get people to come back. . . whereas before if I was worried about their weight I'd get them to come back and then I didn't really have a good plan of what to do, what blood work to do, to refer them, not to refer them, all that sort of stuff. Now I know\" (FP6). 2. Front-end office coordination and staff capacity are necessary. FPs found they depended on administrative staff to conduct BMI measurements and administer the Healthy Habits Question - naire. They reported that sustainability of toolkit implementation was contingent on the capacity of front-end administrative staff and that \"secretaries were the main ones involved in starting the process. . . if they weren't involved in this process this would never have happened\" (FP1). FPs reported that measuring BMI in all pe - diatric patients was not sustainable, and that office support staff \"were not going to continue doing it\" (FP6) because measuring heights and weights in a private space and calculating BMI percentiles could be quite time-consuming. 3. A collective approach that involves all sec - tors of a community is necessary. FPs acknowledged the importance of a collective, consistent, community-wide approach to achieving healthy childhood weights: \"education needs to not only be done in the doctor's office but in the schools, in public health, in the leisure centres, in the rec centres, in everywhere that kids are going to be, in everywhere that families are going to be\" (FP6). According to an - other physician, \"using the same language\" across a community \"is going to hopefully reinforce the same messages. . . and if we repeat it often enough and people hear it often enough it might then be the key to, to making it happen\" (FP2). Conclusions The implementation of whole-community, mul- tisectoral, childhood obesity prevention using the Live 5-2-1-0 Toolkit was found to enhance physicians' knowledge and self-efficacy when managing pediatric patients with obesity, and caused positive changes in physicians' health promotion practices. The predominant aid to implementation for FPs was the simplicity and clarity of the Live 5-2-1-0 message, while a major barrier to implementation was the lack of front-end staff capacity. Finally, the importance of a whole-community approach that mobilized all sectors was identified as an important theme. Managing obesityA systematic review of primary care interven- tions for managing childhood obesity supports our study finding that empowering provid- ers through training (e.g., in motivational in- terviewing) and education leads to increased knowledge, skills, and confidence in managing pediatric obesity. Empowering providers also increases adherence to expert committee recom- mendations.26 Studies of other similar primary care interventions built on the Live 5-2-1-0 guidelines19 have reported positive changes in physicians' practices related to child and ado- lescent obesity.18,27,28 Gibson, for example, noted significant increases in behavioral education/ counseling (from 9% to 87%) within two rural health clinics. 27Routinely using Live 5-2-1-0 resources to address behaviors was found to empower physicians in our pilot study by destigma- tizing weight and standardizing the process of brief counseling sessions for weight- and health-related behavior. This seemed to lessen commonly reported barriers faced by physicians when discussing childhood obesity, which in- clude the sensitive nature of the topic and lack of knowledge, comfort, and self-efficacy.15-17,29,30 We observed increases in physician-reported knowledge and self-efficacy that translated into practice change, with an increase in the routine promotion of healthy behaviors and the use of behavioral goal setting. Similar improvements in self-efficacy that translated into practice changes were found by Barlow and colleagues after brief training and support for primary care providers.31 However, only half the participating FPs in our study felt that their patients were better able to self-manage issues of lifestyle as a result of the intervention, which underscores the potential impact that external environmen- tal and systemic barriers can have on individual habits. This in turn reinforces our qualitative finding that physicians feel complementary community-wide health promotion efforts and supports are also necessary, a finding borne out by other studies.32,33 Our qualitative findings also showed that the Live 5-2-1-0 message and accompanying re- sources were major drivers of physician-related changes. Several studies that outline barriers to pediatric obesity prevention and management in primary care report the need for better tools to support counseling and communication with patients and families.16,17,24 The Live 5-2-1-0 message, tools, and resources may fill this gap by providing primary care physicians with the means to open conversations with families about weight and health behaviors in a simple and nonjudgmental manner. Study limitations Our study had several limitations, including the lack of a control group, a small sample size, the lack of completed postintervention surveys from 7 of 21 participating physicians, and a short intervention period that varied between study sites. Self-selection bias may have skewed the sample and led to the recruitment of only those The Live 5-2-1-0 Toolkit for family physicians201 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 6 | july/August 2020201 CliniC alFPs who are passionate about health promotion. If this were the case, we would expect physicians without a special interest in health promotion to benefit even more from the toolkit than those who participated in our study. The duration of toolkit use in both communities was based on the capacity of the clinics at the time of the pilot study. We would not expect that the variabil-ity of the study periods between communities would impact the comparability of the findings between communities. Lastly, social desirabil-ity bias may have influenced survey responses. Given the various limitations, results from this pilot study are not easily generalizable. Summary Childhood obesity continues to increase in Canada and worldwide, posing a major public health challenge. A pilot study in two BC com- munities found healthy behaviors that prevent childhood obesity can be achieved in the prima - ry care setting by using a simple Live 5-2-1-0 message: 5 vegetables and fruits, 2 hours at most of recreational screen time, 1 hour of physi- cal activity, 0 sugar-sweetened beverages each day. The Live 5-2-1-0 Toolkit intervention was found to destigmatize discussions about weight and healthy habits and provide a foundation for brief counseling sessions. Further research is needed to explore interventions and strate- gies that reduce the burden of routine BMI measurement on office staff. n Competing interests None declared. references 1.

Demon- strators and activists have made it clear that they expect people (particularly White people) in po- sitions of leadership and of privilege, who have a voice to use it. As physicians and community leaders, it is incumbent on us to listen, learn, reflect, and act. It is within our collective and individual powers to improve the health care inequity that our Black patients face. The phrase \"silence is compliance\" has been emblazoned on signs across the globe at #BlackLivesMatter demonstrations. It is no longer satisfactory to be \"not racist\"\u2014we must be actively \"antira- cist.\" Actually, being is a misnomer because, as Ibram X. Kendi has pointed out, inaction on racist policies has been a form of racism all along.1 Women have historically been vastly under- represented in clinical trials.2 Black women even more so. In 2019, Nnorom and colleagues pub- lished a scoping review on breast and cervical cancer in Black Canadians (people of African/ Caribbean/Black ancestry living in Canada).3 The study found that only 23 out of a possible 1921 papers they examined included health data specific to Black women. The authors wrote that Black women in Canada faced barriers to health care predominantly related to lower screening Black women's health matters We don't know much about Black women's health in Canada, largely because we don't collect statistics by race. The data, scant as they are, indicate that addressing systemic racism will lead to better health outcomes for Black women in Canada.

She serves on the BCMJ Editorial Board. This article has been peer reviewed.rates rather than access to treatment.3 This is concerning because data from the United States and the United Kingdom indicate that Black women are more likely to die of cancer than their White counterparts.3,4 For example, the American Cancer Society's 2019 Surveillance Report cited a lower prevalence of breast can- cer in non-Hispanic Black women at 126.5 (per 100 000) versus 130 (rate ratio 0.97). Despite this, the mortality rate was markedly higher in Black women at 28.9 (per 100 000) versus 20.6 in White women (rate ratio 1.41). 5 One thing we can derive from these statis- tics is that Black women might have inadequate access to screening, which results in missed opportunities to detect and treat aggressive cancers at an earlier stage. The Canadian Cancer Society does not report its annual statistics by race.6 So, if we don't collect data to understand the scope of the problem, how can we expect to solve it? It ap- pears that people have been asking this question for years. A Black Experiences in Health Care Symposium held in Toronto in 2017 suggested that to make the system more equitable, \"data quality challenges\" should be addressed. For example, they identified an urgent need for data sets that include race and ethnicity.7 During the second Black Experiences in Health Care Symposium, held in January 2020, race-based data collection remained a key theme. The plan- ning committee's number-one recommendation was for mandated data collection in partnership with Black communities, and including Black leadership, to measure, improve, and publicly report on care and outcomes.8 An investigation by the Globe & Mail pub- lished last year exposed how far Canada lags behind other nations in collecting racial data.9 In the article, it was postulated that our \"Ca-nadian way\" of avoiding the unease of difficult subjects (like race) is part of the reason we are less likely to collect racial data than other countries. In pretending we are \"col- or blind,\" we have actually harmed Black Canadians by failing to study and address our health care disparities. There are Canadian articles that address rac- ism in medicine and how it affects Black wom- en. A complete literature review is beyond the scope of this essay, but a few titles are included here for inspiration. Researchers from Queen's University and the University of Ottawa recent- ly published a report in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology called \"Behind the times: revisiting endometriosis and race.\" In it, they describe the historical bias of treating endometriosis as a \"disease of white women in higher income brackets.\" This led to years of misdiagnosis for Black women with pelvic pain as pelvic inflammatory disease rather than the complex, chronic disease of endometriosis.10 The authors explain that these \"misdiagnoses stemmed from the still pervasive myth that women of color were somehow immune to endometriosis and the stereotype that African American women were more promiscuous than their white peers.\"10,11Women have historically been vastly underrepresented in clinical trials. Black women even more so.204 BC MEDICAL JOuRNAL VOL . 62 n O. 6 | Ju Ly/Augu ST 2020 204premise In Black-White Health Inequalities in Canada, the researchers analyzed multiple health out- comes such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and mental health.12 One of their con- clusions was that \"race-based discrimination, a lifelong stressor, contributes to the development of hypertension . . . and to insulin resistance.\" The On the Margins project undertaken in rural Nova Scotia concluded that, \" any future research [on Canadian Black women] be un- dertaken with the recognition that race interacts with numerous other variables and experiences [that] determine health.\"13 This concept was echoed in a December 2019 publication by Chief Public Health Officer of Canada Dr The- resa Tam, in a report titled, \"Addressing stigma: Towards a more inclusive health system.\"14 A highlighted excerpt from the report calls on us all to stop the \"slow and insidious practice of dehumanizing others.\" Systemic racism relates to systems, which we can control and change. This can be differ- entiated from individual racism, which refers to \"assumptions, beliefs, and behaviours,\" con-scious or unconscious that are, arguably, more difficult to change. 15 Recognizing the way our health systems discriminate, and actively work- ing to fix them, will promote change and fair-ness. The data, scant as they are, indicate that addressing systemic racism will lead to better health outcomes for Black women in Canada. We all have a role to play in this problem and in its solution. I am pleased to \"turn the pages over\" to an invited contribution by Dr Marjorie Dixon. references 1. Kendi IX. Ibram X.

Marjorie Dixon, MD, FRCSC, FACOG, REI Dr Dixon is an assistant professor at the University of Toronto. She is a subspecialist in gynecologic reproductive endocrinology and infertility and founder of Anova Fertility & Reproductive Health. Dr Dixon is a member of the Black Physicians Association of Ontario and past recipient of the YWCA Women of Distinction Award and RBC Canadian Women Entrepreneur of the Year Award.\"Why did you go into medicine?\" I find it curious that I still get asked this question, 15 years into prac- tice. \"Were your parents doctors?\" Or \"Was your father a businessman?\" It's as if being a young, Black, female doctor and entrepreneur simply doesn't compute in the minds of the average non-Black individual. I went into medicine as a Black woman of Jamaican Canadian heritage, embracing the ideals of non-maleficence and filled with the requisite zeal and optimism ex-pected of a future medical professional. And let's be honest: I knew about the dis- parities that existed with access to care and in particular for women who looked like me. It was (and remains) a well-known fact in our com- munity that Black women routinely encounter barriers to care. We have learned that in order to receive equal health care opportunities, we must advocate loudly for ourselves. The system simply doesn't work well for us. I had personally witnessed colleagues dismissing, not validating, minimizing, and exhibiting bias where Black women were concerned as they presented with a host of women's health and fertility issues. I did my best to \"be the voice\" and speak up, encouraging my compatriots to not be ignored, that their race-specific health issues mattered. But when it came to me\u2014looking like me and in my role as physician/practice owner\u2014I learned to be quiet about the discrimination that I experienced throughout my training and career. I didn't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. After all, what purpose would this serve? I didn't quip back when a colleague mused that I likely got into medical school \"because I filled a minority quota.\" I guess it had nothing to do with my 4.0 GPA. Another colleague in recent years was chatting casually with me between surgical cases. She felt at ease with me and thus a bold statement ensued: \"The only reason that you are in the position that you are right now is because you are Black, pretty, and well spoken\". I had no words. And yes folks, this was right here in Canada. So now that we have identified anti-Black racism in medicine and our glorious and free nation, we must continue to name it, speak out about it, and begin to do the hard work involved in changing the systems that have enabled it. And these must be big changes. I recently read that there was only one Black medical graduate from the University of Toronto's medical faculty, class of 2020. We can, and must, change the system so that the people treating patients are actually representative of the very population whose lives depend on them. And thus, the specific health issues of our community will be addressed\u2014finally and at long last. May this Black Lives Matter movement be the impetus to that very change. nI learned to be quiet about the discrimination that I experienced throughout my training and career. I didn't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable.premise206 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 6 | July/August 2020206Deaths from COVID-19 have dispro- portionately affected seniors living in long-term care. Only 1% of Canadi- ans reside in long-term care, but these deaths represent 80% of all COVID deaths in Canada.1 This statistic is a result of issues that have been worsening for years; it is unfortunate that it took a pandemic to unmask the shortcomings of our long-term care facilities. Three factors have made care facilities par- ticularly vulnerable: the staffing model, aging facilities, and a frail, dependent client popula-tion. The problems with staffing are structural. Inadequate pay and part-time hours require care aides to work in more than one facility, allowing infections to spread between care homes. Lack of sick pay and a shortage of staff may have also encouraged some individuals to continue work- ing even after becoming ill. Additionally, low pay has led to high staff turnover and reliance on temp agencies, which reduces staff familiar- ity with infection control measures. As for the facilities themselves, many have shared bedrooms and bathrooms as well as crowded public areas, which make physical dis- tancing difficult and negatively affect the or- ganization's ability to meet cleaning standards. Work conditions were made even more chal- lenging by limited access to personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as staffing shortages resulting from sick or quarantined staff. To be clear, individual health care staff are not at fault. Many continue to work despite fears for their own safety and while grieving the loss of resi-dents for whom they have cared. Prior to the pandemic, the BC Ministry of Health had increased the number of hours This article is the opinion of the Geriatrics and Palliative Care committee, a subcommittee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opinion of Doctors of BC. This article has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.at care facilities to 3.36 from 3.14 hours per day, per client. While welcome, this increase is likely still inadequate. In less than 3.5 hours per day, staff are expected to provide each cli-ent with medications, personal hygiene, feed-ing, mobility assistance, and other services. This client population is becoming increasingly dependent and complex. Many live with multiple comorbidities, with an av- erage of 65% of the clients being significantly cogni- tively impaired and 30% completely dependent on staff for all activities of daily living.2,3 Those with dementia may wander throughout the facility, unable to practise proper hygiene. During the pandemic, steps have been taken to alleviate these problems. Staff are banned from working in multiple facilities and have been receiving full-time pay. Residents and workers are screened for illness, and PPE supply has increased. A rapid response SWAT team of infection control specialists was created to quickly respond to outbreaks. Care facilities have banned all visitors (excluding compas- sionate visits), leaving families struggling with their inability to see their loved ones, worrying about their health and well-being, and being unable to supplement care. What can physicians do to help their clients in care? First, we can advocate for adequate funding to provide safer, more effective care. Consider supporting the national call to bring long-term care under the Canada Health Act, which would include targeted federal funding, national standards of care (including an increase to 4.1 hours of care per day), and place limits on private, for-profit care. 1,2,4 Second, we can discuss goals of care with cli- ents and/or their families. For clients who may not benefit from acute care transfer and hospital admission, it is important to communicate this well in advance. Inform them about the avail-ability of care in facilities, including palliative care options.5 Many frail, elderly patients at the end of life would prefer to receive care in their facility, which is their home, rather than be transferred to hospital for uncomfortable and ultimately futile care. Finally, physicians can suggest ways for families and friends to stay in touch with their relatives in care. Options include phone or video calls, or old-fashioned letters and postcards. Families may also drop off familiar ob- jects from home (with permission from the fa- cility to ensure proper hy- giene protocols are followed) or arrange visits that respect physical distancing, with the cli- ent inside and the family member outside a plate-glass window. n \u2014Maria Chung, MDCM references 1.

As of May 2020, there have been 76 000 cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Canada, including 2446 cases and 146 deaths in Brit- ish Columbia. The emergence of COVID-19 is concerning in BC, where an ongoing pub- lic health emergency was declared in April 2016 related to high rates of drug overdose deaths. In the past 4 years, more than 5000 illicit drug toxicity deaths have been reported in BC.1 COVID-19 disproportionately affects people who use substances, including risk of transmission, severity of outcome of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and drug overdose risk. How are people who use substances impacted by COVID-19? People who use substances are often socio- economically marginalized and precariously housed, and may, therefore, be unable to physi- cally distance and maintain hand sanitation. Congregate living environments such as shel- ters, supportive housing, and single-room oc- cupancy hotels can exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk, as has been seen in Toronto where more than 300 cases were identified in shelters.2 Furthermore, people who use sub- stances are disproportionally affected by chronic conditions that increase susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, such as chronic pulmo- nary and coronary heart disease.3 The physician's role in supporting people who use substances in a dual public health emergency This article is the opinion of the BC Centre for Disease Control and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.Measures to address COVID-19 may place people who use substances at increased risk of drug overdose. Drug markets have become volatile due to border and travel restrictions and limited availability of precursor chemicals, creating a more unpredictable and toxic drug supply. Drug testing services have reduced ca- pacity and are not equita - bly distributed across the province, thus making it difficult to determine im - plicated substances and issue meaningful com- munity alerts. Overdose deaths in- creased 61% across BC in March 2020 compared to February 2020.1 The cause of this resurgence in overdose fatalities and the extent to which COVID-19 is implicated has yet to be fully determined. However, reduced access to harm reduction services, including observed con- sumption sites, increased drug toxicity, and changes to individual drug use practices and settings are amplifying the already high risk of overdose in BC. Supporting people who use substances People who use substances are more likely to die from overdose than COVID-19. Thus, it is imperative to support safer substance use by encouraging use of observed consumption sites, which are designated essential clinical services, and using with others at a safe distance. In addition, individuals should be equipped for overdose response. Online take-home naloxone training is available at www.naloxonetraining .com, and take-home naloxone kits are available from over 1500 sites throughout BC, including 700 community pharmacies. Patients should be counseled to use additional doses of naloxone as required to reduce the need for additional resus- citative procedures. Harm reduction recommen - dations, like using small test doses of substances and accessing new pipes and needles, will help patients avoid both over- dose and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Supporting individuals with opioid and other sub- stance use disorders is a priority at this time. Lack of access to substances due to physical distancing and quarantine orders can put individuals at risk of withdrawal. Physicians must recognize clinic and emergency depart- ment visits and telemedicine consultations as opportunities to connect patients with counsel- ing, mental health, and social housing options, and to provide safer alternatives to the illicit drug market. This includes offering a range of opioid agonist therapies (for buprenorphine/ naloxone, observed or take-home inductions, standard and microdosing options), and safely providing patients with missed opioid agonist therapy doses or prescription refills and refer-rals to addictions specialists. Additionally, re- cent BC risk mitigation guidelines recommend that health care providers offer pharmaceutical replacements for illicit substances.4 COVID-19 is impacting the mental health and well-being of people who use substanc- es as they navigate increased isolation com- pounded with ongoing trauma caused by the overdose crisis. Physicians have an important role in supporting people with substance use Measures to address COVID-19 may place people who use substances at increased risk of drug overdose. 208 BC Medi Cal Journal vol. 62 no. 6 | July/August 2020208BCCDC 2019 J.H.

Eligible patients can pick up FIT kits from any public or private lab across the province with a referral from their health care provider. For patients who had picked up their FIT kit at the time of the testing suspension and have not completed it, now is the time to complete the test and return it to the lab. Labs in BC have introduced special mea- sures to keep patients and staff safe from COVID-19. It is recommended that patients check with their preferred labs for any COVID-19 related procedures or instructions prior to picking up their FIT kit. More information about FIT kits is avail- able at www.screeningbc.ca/covid-19. Breast cancer screening resumes The BC Cancer Breast Screening Program re- sumed screening mammography services in select screening centre sites in June. The intro- duction of screening mammography occurred in a measured, phased approach, with each site working with downstream diagnostic ser-vices to ensure there is capacity for follow-up ImmunizeBC is recommending that physicians who provide routine childhood vaccinations contact the parents of their young patients to bring their vaccines up to date. The BCCDC has developed a docu- ment for physicians (Continuity, Prioritization and Safe Delivery of Immunization Services During COVID-19 Response) which provides guidance on infant and childhood immunization programs, as well as those for adults. Priority immunizations are the infant series, includ- ing the doses beginning at 2 months of age, and the 12-month doses. Physicians who do not usually provide immunization services directly but have pediatric or high-risk adult patients in their practice can encourage parents and others to continue with immunization services through their local health unit.Childhood immunizations drop during COVID-19210 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 6 | July/August 2020210news procedures, as well as sufficient personal pro- tective equipment on hand before resuming services. It is anticipated that all sites, including three mobile screening units, will be screen - ing again in July. This measured approach is to ensure that patient anxiety due to abnormal screening results is minimized, and to provide a safe environment for cancer screening to occur. Hand hygiene: Hand sanitizer and/or hand-washing stations are available at all screening sites to support good hand hygiene. Physical distancing: Breast screening cen- tres have rearranged their waiting areas and allow more time between patients to support physical distancing. Unscheduled walk-in appointments will not be accom - modated at this time. Enhanced cleaning: Mammography equip - ment and exam rooms are frequently cleaned and sanitized in accordance with provincial guidelines. Personal protective equipment: Screening staff wear personal protective equipment including surgical masks, appropriate eye protection, and gloves to protect themselves and others. COVID-19 screening: Patients are screened for COVID-19 symptoms at the entrance to the building or facility.The Breast Screening Program has been contacting patients on existing wait lists and those whose previous appointments were canceled due to COVID-19 to book a new appointment. Breast screening was temporarily suspend- ed in March to support physical distancing measures and to assist in efforts to minimize COVID-19 transmission in the community. A temporary suspension in screening services allowed hospitals to redeploy and train essential health care workers in the likelihood of a po-tential surge in COVID-19 patients requiring acute care.

An AI solution to COVID-19 BC-based Patriot One Technologies and its subsidiary, Xtract Technologies, is collaborat-ing with Vancouver General Hospital and the University of British Columbia, among others, to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) solution to help radiologists identify the increased risk of COVID-19. CT and X-ray scans obtained from around the world are being labeled from a group of 14 radiologists into three classes: background, normal lung, and ground glass opacity (GGO). The percentage of lung vol- ume affected by GGO is a leading indicator for COVID-19, and the development of an automated approach to assess this can greatly assist medical practitioners to quickly diagnose early onset of the virus. Using these labeled images, the Xtract AI team is training 3D residual networks (a style of AI algorithm) to automatically identify GGO volumes in the lungs and compare them with the total volume of the lungs. The ratio of af- fected lungs in new patients can then be cal- culated from analyzing CT and X-ray images of their lungs. The project is being led by Dr Savvas Nico- laou and Dr William Parker and is supported by the UBC Community Health and Well- being Cloud Innovation Centre. Additional support for the project is being provided by the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute. The team will continue to improve the model as more data become available, with the aim of achieving greater than 90% diagnostic ac - curacy. The model has been released under an open source licence, to be shared with health care facilities worldwide to help early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients.

Guide for youth living with schizophrenia The Schizophrenia Society of Canada has de- veloped a guide for both the young people who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and the health care professionals, families, and oth - ers who support them. The guide is a resource with up-to-date and accessible information about living with and beyond schizophrenia, and setting the course toward recovery, offer- ing readers information on the types of health services and support that are available. The guide, Hope and Recovery, Your Guide to Living with and Beyond Schizophrenia, is based on the Canadian Schizophrenia Treatment Guidelines developed in 2017 by a multidis- ciplinary team of experts, patients, and family members from across Canada. It is available online at https://schizophrenia.ca/wp-content/ uploads/2020/05/Hope-and-Recovery-Guide .pdf.212 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 6 | July/August 2020212special feature Code green: Building financial independence Ten investing lessons learned (the hard way). Lorne Porayko, MD, FRCPC, CIM, David Wingnean, MD, CCFP , MBA Dr Porayko is a consultant anesthesiologist and critical care physician practising in Victoria. Dr Wingnean is a family physician practising in Edmonton, Alberta. He is also a co-founder of The Osler Fund and was a senior biotechnology analyst with TD Securities. This article has been peer reviewed.Only a fool learns from his own mis- takes. The wise man learns from the mistakes of others.\" - Otto von Bismarck It's late 1999. Technology investors are de- spondent as they parse their ravaged portfolios. The phone rings. It's my father, a respected neurosurgeon, who has been eagerly anticipating a comfortable retirement. But something has hap - pened. He tells me that he has been wiped out. He wants to know why. After all, he asked his ad- visor to position him very conservatively. We found out\u2014far too late\u2014that 90% of his portfolio had been invested by his stockbro- ker in the infamous company Nortel. Ouch. The result has been very upsetting: despite working hard all his life, my dad has never traveled off this continent and is even reluctant to launder his clothes! This is because he is terrified he will run out of money. This disaster taught my family the first of many lessons. Over the past 2 decades, David and I have been motivated students of the capital mar- kets. We have been struck by how similar the opportunities occur during market panic. Similarly, the best clinicians are kind and empathetic, yet cool as a cucumber under pressure. 6. The tougher things get, the more patient you should be. William Osler famously said, \"What is patience but an equanimity which enables you to rise superior to the trials of life.\"1 In markets, having a long-term focus is an enormous competitive advantage. The average investor's holding period of a stock has dropped from 8 years in the 1960s to only 8 months in 2016! 7. Simple is better than complicated. If you don't understand it well enough to explain it to an 8-year-old, don't do it. 8. \"You can't make a good deal with a bad person.\" A quote from Warren Buffett that applies to all avenues in life: integrity mat - ters. A lot. 9. Recognize your limitations. 10 It's actually true: money isn't everything! Your most precious assets are your family, your health, and your time. Guard them, invest in them, and cherish them. We think these lessons have made us much better doctors and investors. n Competing interests Drs Porayko and Wingnean are founders of 3P Fi- nancial, a pension advisory company for profes- sionals. They are also registered dealing agents for McElvaine Investment Management Ltd., a portfolio manager. reference 1. Silverman ME, Murray TJ, Bryan CS, editors. The quot - able Osler. American College of Physicians, Philadel - phia; 2003. practices of medicine and investing are, particu- larly in terms of the burgeoning importance of decision science. We have certainly made our share of mistakes and unforced errors. We would like to share 10 lessons we have learned (mostly the hard way) in the hope that the reader might not stumble where we have. Don't expect too much, though! It's our consis- tent experience that most of us have to make our own mistakes: geniuses are truly rare. 1. No one cares about your wealth as much as you do. Like a patient under general anesthesia, your financial position needs careful monitoring. 2. Think about the downside risk first. In other words, before you go down the path of an intervention or investment, try to imagine what could go terribly wrong and how that might play out. Do you have an edge? Is the risk worth the benefit? 3. If it sounds too good to be true, it prob - ably is. In the medical world, single-centre RCTs have often yielded impressive results that entice early adopters, only to be over - turned by subsequent research. Financial opportunities are no different: the devil is in the fine print. Delve deep. 4. Is there a margin of safety? Remember the idea of a therapeutic window in pharma - cology? The larger the therapeutic window, the safer the drug. The margin of safety in finance is analogous: it's a financial back - stop of sorts. 5. The tougher things get, the calmer you should be.

I had graduated from high school and was eager to face the world, focused on the promised land of a career in medicine. I began my summer vacation as an orderly at the King George Hospital in Winni- peg. The first week was spent getting acquainted with the hospital routine. I looked forward to going home to Winkler on the weekend. Just as I arrived home, our family doctor called, wanting to see me. His first remark, \"You have been burning the candle at both ends,\" was a prelude to the reason for my visit home. A pre-employment chest X-ray had shown a shadow the size of a dime in the apex of my right lung. He suggested that I see a Dr Scott at the Central Tuberculosis Clinic (CTC) in Winnipeg on the following Monday morning, where my immediate future would be decided. Disrupted plans I arrived at the CTC on 15 July 1956 and had my first glimpse of the small X-ray shadow that was about to disrupt my previous plans. After brief deliberation, I was directed to spend 6 months in a TB sanatorium, under quarantine. I felt both surprise and disbelief. \"You must be kidding! I feel perfectly well, and besides, I'm Quarantine, tuberculosis, and the curtailment of freedom My experience with curtailment of freedom as a quarantined tuberculosis patient in the 1950s is interesting to reflect upon at this time of COVID-19. Abe Zacharias, MD, FRCPC Dr Zacharias is a retired radiologist living in Victoria. He is married to the \"lady who was dressed in a colorful, striped Hudson Bay coat\" whom he first met at the Ninette Sanatorium. This article has been peer reviewed.starting college in 2 months. You can't do this to me!\" I quickly learned that he could, and he would. By that evening, I had taken up resi- dence at my new hospital address, the CTC in Winnipeg for 3 weeks, before moving on to the Ninette Sanatorium in southwestern Manitoba. My roommates proved to be a pleasant group, but they were not very encouraging. The standard question around the place was, \"How long did the doc say that you would be here?\" My 6-month sentence drew laughter. One patient said, \"Six months, eh. Don't bet on it. You'll be here for 2 years at least. I'm in for the third time. My last session lasted 5 years!\" The next 3 weeks were the longest of my life. Imagine spending 23 hours a day in bed, even though you feel perfectly well. To make mat- ters worse, the nurses' tennis court was directly across the street! Never had I wanted to play tennis as much as I did during those 3 weeks spent in what I called \"Cell 41.\" Families divided The sanatorium at Ninette, the San for short, is located on a beautiful hillside overlooking Peli- can Lake, 200 km west of Winnipeg. I joined my father there, as he had already been there 6 years. Father and son, together again, but in isolation! He had been forced, by contracting TB himself, to leave our family farm in 1950, at the age of 33, leaving behind a wife and five children, ranging in age from 1 to 12. I was the oldest. During those 6 years in hospital, he had undergone extensive \"lung collapse therapy.\" This included repeated pneumothoraces, plom- bage (Ping-Pong balls), wax packs, and at least three separate thoracoplasties, which involved the removal of multiple ribs. The end result was a loss of two-thirds of his lung capacity and severe shortness of breath at rest. All of these procedures were performed under local anesthetic. My father's departure from the farm had a major impact on my family. How was my mother to provide an income sufficient to raise five children? There was no social security in- come. The only answer was to continue farming. My younger brother and I worked on the farm until high school graduation, with the help of an uncle. This meant dawn-till-dusk days of physical work and included driving the tractor for planting, hoeing, and harvesting. We always needed time off school in spring and fall. Tragedy again struck with the death of my mother. She died from an aggressive form of ovarian cancer when she was only 46. This was during my second year at the San, and my dad's seventh year there. We were both given compas- sionate leave to return home for a brief time, but with strict precautions. Following this, we returned to Ninette and stayed there until the health authorities would declare us \"safe to re- sume public life.\" My cure, via triple therapy, would eventually take 2 years. My father, who was gaunt and quite underweight in 1950, missed out on triple therapy. He was hospital-ized for 11 years in total. Sadly, he eventually died from TB and its complications. My dad had two brothers who developed TB, and they were both quarantined, far from home. Just like ours was, their families were greatly disrupted by their illnesses. A newly minted physician, Dr Zacharias returns to visit his father at the Ninette Sanatorium in southwestern Manitoba. 219 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 6 | july/August 2020219Back p aGe Chasing the cure I became acquainted with the phrase, \"to chase the cure.\" This described the adjustment we all had to make. A brief idea of a day in the life of a TB crock: breakfast was served at 7:30. Dessert consisted of a handful of pills, para-aminosalicylic acid and isoniazid, nine at each meal. As a rookie I had some difficulty swallowing them one at a time, but after several weeks this became a one-shot affair. Strepto- mycin was given by injection twice per week, in the strep room. We queued up, and when we reached the front of the long line, we quickly bared our bottoms. This was before the days of disposable needles. The most important point was to learn to relax the gluteus maximus! Much of the day was spent in bed, and ingestion of the pills was strictly monitored. After my first 3-week interval of triple therapy at Ninette, various tests and X-rays were taken in anticipation of conference day, or \"judgment day.\" The San medical staff pre- sided. Upon entering the conference room, I was met by a long row of X-rays, the length depending on whether you were a veteran or a freshman. I was seated in a chair in the centre of the room, surrounded by the medical staff. My history was reviewed and discussed, and my X-rays were examined. While the men in the long white coats conversed in a language foreign to me, I'm sure my pulse rate hit 150 and I noticed that my hands were cold and clammy. Finally, my judgment was delivered. \"Eighteen months if all goes well, and surgery may have to be considered.\" Increasing freedoms As soon as my length of stay was determined, the capable rehabilitation division of the San moved in. I quickly realized that I might go mad if I had nothing to do. The University of Manitoba initially turned me down in my application to study first-year arts courses by correspondence, but they eventually let me in. I was their first student-patient studying by correspondence. My classes included English (studying Milton, Donne, and Chaucer), the history of Tudor England, economics, psychol- ogy, and sociology. There are many challenges when you are trying to learn without a teacher, this being long before the Internet. Through hard work and a fair measure of luck, I was able to get the Winnipeg professors to give me the nod, and I completed my first year of undergraduate study at the San. After several months in the infirmary, one was gradually allowed certain freedoms and life became less dull. Male and female patients were housed in separate pavilions, but this did not stop secret communication between the sexes. I was particularly attracted to a lovely young lady who was dressed in a colorful, striped Hudson Bay coat. Christmas was celebrated with a large banquet held on Christmas Eve. The healthier crocks, now noninfectious, formed a choir, and in this way brought favorite carols to the less fortunate brothers and sisters who were con- fined to bed. The highlight of the festivities was a concert held a short time after Christmas. The staff and patients worked together to produce skits and musical numbers. The orchestra consisted of guitars and drums played by Indigenous patients, who were primar- ily M\u00e9tis and Inuit. The program included their favorite western songs. Of interest was the ab- sence of musical stands. The musicians preferred to have their sheet music spread out on the floor. I had the opportunity to direct a mixed Inuit choir, composed of 17 singers, who performed carols in Inuktut. A few dances added excitement to the program. My roommates (up to 10 per room, cough- ing at night) and friends were a diverse group of World War II veterans, Indigenous people, and patients who had survived the brutal Hong Kong prison camps. The months progressed. Old friends were discharged and new ones ar-rived. Many of the chronic patients died from their disease. I became aware of the many social problems that came out of San life. Long peri- ods of spousal separation often led to divorce, for example. An occasional friend, son, daughter, mom, or dad would not return from the OR. Moms and dads were helpless and suffered the anguish of their isolation from their loved ones back at home. The younger patients faced a future of uncertainty, while their friends were pursuing their dreams and goals in life.Free at last Twenty-three months after my arrival, the news of my discharge came, yet it caused little excite- ment. The San had become home to me, and friends outside its walls were almost strangers. I had some-deep seated fears: for my future health, of facing the outside world again, and that my friends would no longer understand or accept me. Finally, on emancipation day, and carrying a tennis ball can full of pills (to be taken after discharge), sporting a clear chest X-ray, I departed from Ninette. I was grate- ful that the University of Manitoba awarded me an annual bursary of $700, which was contingent on my being accepted into, and surviving, medical school. After this eventful medical detour, my goal\u2014to enter the promised land of medicine\u2014would indeed come true. Public health principles stand the test of time During this COVID-19 pandemic, it is inter- esting to reflect that the key to controlling tu- berculosis was free health care for those affected, contact tracing, and enforced isolation, all of which reduced the death rate in North America by 80% before the advent of streptomycin. Ap- plication of public health principles is just as critical today. Canada and the United States have used strikingly different approaches to COVID-19 containment and management. In some US states, individual rights and freedoms are trumping any enforcement for the public good, despite the soaring death rate resulting from those freedoms. There is a high price to be paid for allowing individual freedom to have priority over protecting the public. In Canada, the acceptance of isolation and social distanc-ing is much greater, for the sake of protecting everyone. n Acknowledgments Dr Zacharias thanks Drs Murray Woods and giles Stevenson for their assistance with the prepara- tion of this article.My roommates were pleasant but unencouraging. \"Y ou'll be here for 2 years at least, \" I was told.Over the last few months, we've helped thousands of physicians and their families across Canada manage the impact of the pandemic on their finances and start planning for the \"new normal. \" Join more than 39,000 * Canadian physicians and discover the difference it makes to get the right advice.
