Look no further, as this article discusses homoeopathy for Allergy backed by scientific evidence.", "sitename": "Myupchar", "date": "2019-12-20", "cleaned_text": "An [allergy](https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/allergy) is body's exaggerated immune response to any substance that it considers harmful. These substances, known as allergens, are normally harmless for most other people. When a person, who is allergic to a substance, is exposed to it for the first time, his/her body produces IgE (immunoglobulin E) antibodies. These antibodies find the allergens in the bloodstream and usher them to the white blood cells for destruction. In this process of destruction, a chemical called histamine is released, which results in [swelling](https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/swelling) (inflammation) of the body tissues, itching, increased secretions of body fluids and narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm). Most people are allergic to more than one substance at once. Common allergens include pollen that causes [hay fever](https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/allergic-rhinitis) or seasonal allergic rhinitis, dust, pet dander, food, [insect bites](https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/insect-bites), mould and medicines. Genetic and environmental factors play a major role in making one prone to allergies. A child who suffers from an allergy is likely to have a parent who has the allergy as well, though it is not always the case. Depending on the allergen, an individual may experience symptoms such as [itching](https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/itching), rash ( [hives](https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/hives)), swelling, [sneezing](https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/sneezing), [runny nose](https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/runny-nose) and breathlessness. Skin and blood tests help to diagnose different allergies. [Anaphylaxis](https://www.myupchar.com/en/disease/severe-allergic-reaction-anaphylactic-shock) is a severe form of an allergic reaction which presents as severe itching in the eyes, swelling in the throat that prevents swallowing and breathing, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, hives, confusion and dizziness. It may be fatal if emergency medical care is not provided. In homoeopathy, acute remedies relieve the symptoms of allergies, while long-term treatment reduces the frequency and intensity of subsequent attacks. These remedies are selected on the basis of the characteristics of a patient's personality and physiology. Common remedies include apis, arsenicum album, urtica urens. The dosage of the remedy is prescribed by the homeopathic physician based on each individual case. "}
