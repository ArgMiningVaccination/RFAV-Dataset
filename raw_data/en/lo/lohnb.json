And they all hold promises: Get more energy! Score shiny hair! Live longer! But which promises should you believe, And just how much should you self-prescribe? \"If you're looking for just some basic health and beauty benefits, [collagen](https://www.byrdie.com/collagen-4846440) is going to be a fairly safe bet to bring into your daily routine,\" says [Kate Cline](https://www.instagram.com/DublinDietitian/), RD, a functional medical nutrition practitioner in Dublin, OH. \"If you are looking for therapeutic benefits, such as dealing with osteoarthritis, it may be best to work with a trained health practitioner who understands some of these nuances and can help you personalize the best type, dosage, and duration for your situation and goals.\" Whichever supplement you choose, check that it's third-party tested. \"If a product claim seems too good to be true, it probably is,\" says [Jay Sirois](https://www.chpa.org/about-chpa/staff/staff/regulatory-scientific-affairs/jay-sirois-phd), PhD, senior director of regulatory and scientific affairs at the Consumer Healthcare Products Association in Washington, DC. \"Some bad actors are selling illegal products that promise miracle benefits or cures. You should avoid any product with exaggerated label claims, especially from companies you have never heard of being sold via online marketplaces. And please know, 'natural' does not always mean 'safe.'\" Meet the Expert [Kate Cline](https://www.instagram.com/DublinDietitian/), RD, a functional medical nutrition practitioner in Dublin, OH.

[Mackenzie Luxury. [Ashley Larsen](https://www.instagram.com/ashleylarsennutrition/), RDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Fresno, CA. What to Look For in a Beauty and Health Supplement Third-party testing When it comes to choosing a supplement, Moskovitz recommends looking for a product that's been tested by a third-party company. \"While most supplements are relatively safe, they're not regulated by the FDA,\" she says. \"For that reason, some products may not have all the ingredients listed on the label. Fortunately, there are third-party testing companies that check for product quality or safety issues. Look for a USP, ConsumerLab, or an NSP seal on the back of the bottle to guarantee quality control.\" Thoroughly read the ingredient list Specifically, Moskovitz recommends looking for any unusual or unfamiliar ingredients on a supplement's ingredient list. \"Many supplements will contain some well-known nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin D, and magnesium; however, there are also a plethora of herbs and extracts that are often bundled in to enhance the results and marketability of a product,\" she says. \"Most of these are innocuous, but if you're taking any prescription medications or have certain medical conditions, these extras might do more harm than good.\" Her advice? Always consult with a dietician or your prescribing MD to ensure that the supplement is safe for you. Check the claims Supplement brands often make lofty claims about their products, but they're usually not as life-changing as they're sometimes marketed to be. That said, Moskovitz says it's up to you to do your own research. \"Supplements are expensive and can eat up a lot of your paycheck, especially if you're committing to daily consumption,\" she says. \"For that reason, before you go to your cart to check out, make sure you fully check out all the claims and associated research. Supplements can be helpful, but their results are often subtle and are certainly not a quick-fix cure. They are only effective when they are truly filling in a gap, targeting a specific issue, or contain specific ingredients that are well-studied\u2014and in some cases, you're not getting more than false hope in a well-packaged bottle.\" To clear up the confusion, we tapped nutrition experts to get the scoop on which supplements actually work\u2014and are safe to consume. Read on for the best beauty and health supplements on the market now.

And although curcumin is impressive, it's not readily absorbed by the body without the addition of piperine, also known as black pepper extract. Piperine increases the availability of curcumin in the blood by 2,000 percent.\" Thus, it's important to choose a turmeric supplement that contains both turmeric and black pepper. \"Bio Schwartz Turmeric Curcumin is affordable and uses turmeric root powder, along with 95 percent curcumin extract and black pepper,\" says [Ashley Larsen](https://www.instagram.com/ashleylarsennutrition/), RDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Fresno, CA. \"Since the capsules contain the root powder, you can open them up and make a tea.\" Price at time of publish: $19 Key Ingredients: Turmeric, turmeric extract, and black pepper fruit extract | Age Range: Adult 18+ | Dosage: 3 capsules | Certified: cGMP compliant Best for Anti-Aging NOW Super Antioxidants NOW Super Antioxidants Vegan Dairy-free Contains caffeine \"There are two primary causes of accelerated aging that appear on the skin,\" says [Trista Best](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristabestldn), RD, a registered dietitian at Balance One Supplements. \"These include excessive unprotected sun exposure and advanced glycation end products (AGEs).

For a beauty or health supplement to be most effective, it's best to follow the directions on the product's label. - Do beauty and health supplements expire? \"Dietary supplements do not require an expiration date, but if there is no expiration date, there needs to be a manufacturing date,\" says Lakatos and Lakatos Shames. \"However, many companies choose to have an expiration date for the convenience of the consumer.\" Why Trust Byrdie Byrdie contributor [Amy Gorin](https://www.byrdie.com/amy-gorin-5196739), MS, RDN is a registered dietitian nutritionist and has over a decade of experience in the nutrition industry, writing for some of the biggest magazines and websites out there.
