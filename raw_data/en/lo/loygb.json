At it's heart, chiropractic care seeks to provide healing from the inside out with non-invasive methods and no chemicals. Through [manual adjustments](https://tuckclinic.com/services/spinal-manipulation-chiropractic-adjustments/) and [supplemental therapies](https://tuckclinic.com/services/electrical-stimulation-therapy/), chiropractic care can reduce pain and inflammation throughout the body using only what the body already possesses to heal. Because of these unique methods, many people use \"alternative medicine\" to describe chiropractic care, but we prefer to look at it as [part of a holistic approach](https://www.thejoint.com/arizona/phoenix/7th-ave-mcdowell-48018/the-holistic-benefits-of-chiropractic-care) that should be integrated with other methods of care. What is Holistic Health and How Does Chiropractic Contribute? Holistic medicine, [by definition](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/what-is-holistic-medicine#1), is a \"form of healing that considers the whole person \u2014 body, mind, spirit, and emotions \u2014 in the quest for optimal health and wellness.\" By treating the person as a whole, instead of just focusing on a single ailment or body system, the individual should be able to achieve optimal health. Holistic healthcare follows a special set of beliefs about health and wellness of the human body: - People have innate healing powers - pharmacological methods are not always needed. - You should treat the person, not the disease - focusing on the disease limits the scope of healing. - Treatment should fix the root of the problem, not just the symptom. - Healing should take a team approach. These are all tenets that the chiropractors at Tuck Chiropractic Clinic stand by. What Other Holistic Methods Can Supplement Chiropractic? Expanding on the concept of a team approach, one discipline of healthcare should never work in a silo. We have long advocated for an [integrated care model centered around the patient's](https://tuckclinic.com/wellness-tips/the-integrated-and-collaborative-care-models-thrives-within-the-tuck-system-of-clinics/) individual needs. We work with primary care practitioners, physical therapists, neurosurgeons, and many more doctors - but our collaboration doesn't stop there. Coordinating care with other methods of holistic health can take the benefits of chiropractic care even further. Many of our doctors supplement their care with holistic techniques like acupuncture or [ dry needling](https://tuckclinic.com/wellness-tips/dry-needling-little-known-technique-gets-big-results/), massage therapy, and manual stretching. They provide diet and [fitness counseling](https://tuckclinic.com/services/chiropractic-and-fitness-counseling/) that can further their healing. We can even help you discover homeopathic or naturopathic solutions to help patients take control of their holistic health at home. The combination of all of these different methods of care and wellness can contribute to the holistic health of the individual - from [reducing stress](https://tuckclinic.com/services/chiropractic-for-stress-relief/) to healing pain, to improving gut health - we're here to help.
