The questionnaire was designed to document patterns of use of herbal remedies in a metropolitan area and to identify the plants most commonly used by this population. The interest in this theme is higher among women, particularly among housewives. People aged 41 to 50 years old also reported higher rates of use. One of the main reasons for the interest in herbal remedies was the belief that plants are more effective than conventional therapies and are associated with lower incidence of side effects. This population uses a total of 316 different plants and one third of them are indigenous to Brazil. The results suggest that there is a strong interest in using herbal remedies by this population and special efforts are thus required to improve the access and quality of such products in Brazil and other larger cities in Latin America.", "sitename": "De Gruyter", "date": "2006-06-06", "cleaned_text": "We interviewed 1072 people interested in medicinal plants and phytotherapy living in Belo Horizonte and its immediate surrounding areas, in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
