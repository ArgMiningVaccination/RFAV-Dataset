When the needles are inserted, you may feel a tapping or pinching sensation, or you may feel nothing at all. Acupuncture utilizes ultra-thin needles that are often thinner than a human hair. Unlike needles used to draw blood or administer injections, acupuncture needles are generally painless. What can you expect during your first visit? Upon a patient's initial visit, the acupuncture practitioner will assess medical history and patient goals to develop a customized treatment plan. Acupuncture treatments are intended to build on each other, meaning a treatment course will often involve appointments occurring weekly or bi-weekly for a period of time. The first course of needles will be administered during the initial visit. What is the cost? The Medi-Spa at Mercy offers acupuncture on Wednesdays between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. The cost is $85 per session. Integrative care and complimentary therapies are slowly beginning to be covered by insurance companies. Depending on your insurance provider and individual plan, you may qualify for partial or even full reimbursement for your acupuncture treatment.

Physicians state that microdermabrasion is beneficial for all skin types and recommend it for everyone, including Caucasians, Asians, Latin Americans and African Americans. The process offers two major benefits: exfoliation and stimulation of new cell growth. Microdermabrasion (or closed dermabrasion) is an epidermal skin exfoliation treatment that utilizes the abrasive action of minute aluminum oxide crystals. These crystals, under pressure, abrade the surface of your skin through a precision handheld device operated by your doctor. This procedure performed in-office typically takes 20-30 minutes to complete with minimal discomfort and the effects on the smoothness, softness, and radiance of your skin are often instantaneous. In addition, microdermabrasion offers the following benefits: - No anesthesia is required to undergo microdermabrasion - Reduction of minor to moderate early aging fine lines - Stimulation of fibroblasts for collagen reproduction - Rejuvenates skin damaged by the sun and/or other environmental distresses - Can noticeably reduce the appearance of scars, rough and dull skin, acne, and stretch marks - Skin feels soft and supple and appears radiant almost immediately following the procedure The Medi-Spa offers the Diamond Dermabrasion system which uses a gentler approach to evenly ablate the skin surface. It features a patented dual control system and adjustable applicator head that delivers a steady, effective stream of fine diamond-shaped crystals directly onto the skin. Massage - Rejuvenation The Medi-Spa at Mercy offers rejuvenation massage using a variety of specialized massage techniques. Rejuvenation Massage offered at the Medi-Spa includes: - Swedish Massage - Deep Tissue Massage - Hot Stone Massage Massage Therapy has many benefits that can help strengthen your immune system, improve your posture, increase your joint flexibility and range of motion, and lower your blood pressure. It can also: - Increase the nourishing blood supply to your tissues - Improve your energy and alertness - Aid in recovery from pulled muscles or sprained ligaments - Offer relief for certain repetitive motion injuries - Ease many of the uncomfortable stresses related to child bearing, such as edema, backaches and exhaustion - Help to compensate for lack of exercise and muscular contraction due to age, injury or illness - Encourage the elimination of waste and toxic debris stored in muscles - Heighten the oxygenation of tissues - Stimulate the relaxation response within the nervous system In today's society we constantly deal with stress, at work, at home, or even at play. It is a necessary component of life. However, frequent or unrelenting stress can have damaging effects on your body resulting in discomfort and pain. High blood pressure, changes in blood sugar, ulcers, headaches, hypertension, colitis and heart disease are only some of the adverse manifestations of stress. It has been shown that one of the best methods to combat stress is massage. Massage can dramatically reverse the damaging physiological effects of stress by helping to lower heart rate and blood pressure, improve circulation, and heighten your sense of well-being (through the release of endorphins). Don't let accumulated stress and tension spoil your pleasure and productivity in life. The Medi-Spa uses the finest products combined with highly trained massage therapists to offer our clients a truly remarkable experience. Your journey follows a sequence of massage movements influenced and inspired by an exotic blend of cultures and techniques. Swedish Massage Swedish massage is the most popular approach to massage therapy, and therefore the modality that comes to mind when most people hear the word \"massage.\" With proven benefits in relaxation and stress reduction, Swedish massage is the best known form of bodywork performed in spas today. Swedish massage incorporates long gliding strokes, circular pressure, percussion-like tapping, bending, stretching and light to medium kneading techniques to stimulate blood flow and decrease toxins within the muscles. A Swedish approach is recommended for first-time massage recipients as well as anyone with the primary goal of relaxation and rejuvenation in mind. Deep Tissue Massage A deep pressure, firm massage, focusing on relieving tension and aching muscles, are the fundamental elements of the Deep Tissue Muscle Massage. Combined with specially blended massage oils, this treatment can be tailor-made to suit the individual needs of the client. Hot Stone Massage Involves the application of water-heated basalt stones of varying sizes to key points on the body and the use of those stones in the massage strokes, and creating sensations of comfort and warmth. The direct heat relaxes muscles, allowing manipulation of a greater intensity than with regular massage. Gift Certificates to The Medi-Spa at Mercy are available upon request. Massage - Therapeutic The Medi-Spa at Mercy offers therapeutic massage using a variety of specialized massage techniques. Therapeutic Massage at The Medi-Spa at Mercy includes: - Oncology Massage - Lymph Drainage Therapy - Prenatal Massage Oncology Massage Oncology massage is a gentle, nurturing style of massage meant to sooth the body, mind and spirit of anyone who is dealing with the effects of cancer and the treatment of cancer (chemotherapy, radiation and surgery). Nurturing touch by oncology massage therapists provides ease from pain, physical and emotional comfort and reinforces a positive connection to health. Because of this, oncology massage is available in many of the world's leading cancer hospitals including Mercy Medical Center. Oncology massage is rarely covered by insurance but there are scholarships and programs available for free massages while hospitalized at Mercy. How can Oncology Massage benefit a cancer patient? Research has shown that massage can reduce the physical effects of cancer treatments including pain, nausea, vomiting and swelling or edema. It also supports health by reducing anxiety, depression, fear and isolation and can help with increased body image, feelings of acceptance and well being. Oncology massage training addresses the full spectrum of cancer-related issues: the physical consequences of cancer, the side effects of various treatments, and also emotional considerations. Your therapist will adapt his/her massage therapy techniques to your specific needs. In the words of one patient, oncology massage is like \"a vacation from cancer.\" Will massage cause my cancer to spread? Some patients have expressed fear that massage may cause cancer to spread but current clinical research has shown that massage does not contribute to the spread of cancer. Our therapists will take into account your desires as well as the areas of cancer. If you have any concern talk to your therapist about her/his plan for your massage. Lymph Drainage Therapy When our lymph circulation stagnates, the fluids, proteins, dead cells and toxins accumulate in the body which can lead to chronic inflammation, chronic pain, allergies and other physical ailments. Using a gentle touch, Lymph Drainage Therapy (LDT) works to help recirculate body fluids, stimulate the immune system, detoxify the body, and balance the autonomic nervous system. LDT can be experienced by those who simply wish to have a detoxification treatment, by those who suffer from some \"Dis-Ease,\" and by people who have had lymph nodes removed due to cancer or infection and wish to help prevent lymphedema. *Please note that those who suffer from lymphedema need to seek treatment from someone trained to treat this condition. Prenatal Massage A massage at any time during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of a pregnancy can help relieve muscle spasms and cramps especially in the back, neck and legs. Massage can increase blood and lymph circulation, help reduce swelling and offer a nurturing touch in a safe, relaxing environment. Women with high risk pregnancies are encouraged to come in for massage with the authorization of a physician or midwife. Gift Certificates to The Medi-Spa at Mercy are available upon request.
