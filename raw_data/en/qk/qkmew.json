What Makes a Holistic Detox Program Special? Holistic healing in all its forms focuses on the whole person rather than just the disease or just physical well-being. At its center, holistic medicine is about balance. Helping patients to learn how to stabilize all the aspects of their lives is the ultimate goal of a holistic detox program. When all things are in balance, the cycle of addiction cannot gain power or continue. Please consider the following reasons why you should choose a holistic rehab center. 1. Flexibility You won't find one-size-fits-all treatment programs at a holistic rehab center. We encourage individuals to experience new and different types of therapies and to engage with the therapeutic models they feel most interested in exploring. After years of substance use, many patients have forgotten who they were before addiction. What were their interests, hobbies, and goals? Flexible programs that encourage individuals to connect with their core selves can open doors and lead detox patients to understand themselves from a holistic, non-judgmental perspective. 2. Complementary Treatments In addition to traditional, evidence-based treatments like behavioral therapies, our holistic detox in Jupiter, Florida includes complementary therapies. Complementary or alternative therapies can help patients better cope with stress. Examples of alternative treatments available from a holistic detox program include: - Dance - Yoga - Medication - Chiropractic care - Massage - Acupuncture and acupressure - Art therapy - Dance - Exercise By learning how to manage stress, patients also learn to cope with situations or feelings that tempt them to return to drug or alcohol use. 3. Individual Attention A holistic detox center focuses on each individual and how they are responding to the process. Patients are able to discuss their progress in one-on-one conversations with staff each day. They can share what they're learning in treatment and ask about other programs that might help create more balance in their recovery process. Rather than being automatically moved through a detox treatment plan that has been proven to work for most people, patients collaborate with counselors and medical staff to create a program that suits their personal needs. In a traditional facility, detox is considered a strictly medical process that requires the patient to adhere to a strict, proven protocol. With a holistic approach, we customize the process of detox. There is a greater focus on personal comfort. How Holistic Detox Can Improve Your Rehab Experience Detoxing is the first significant step in the life-long work of recovery. A successful detox experience lays the foundation for the work to come. Traditional medical detox centers offer science-based techniques and high-quality care. They have helped hundreds of thousands of people go through withdrawals safely and comfortably. However, if you are the kind of person who responds positively to a personalized treatment plan, a holistic program may be the best choice for you.
