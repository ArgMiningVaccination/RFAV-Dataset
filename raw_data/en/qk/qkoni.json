The so-called Mgangas use herbs, massages and holy scriptures for their treatment. Above all, their patients seek protection from evil spirits. By Nermin Ismail Possessed by evil spirits: this healer pours water on a woman's neck to drive away evil, supernatural energy. In order to register, healers must be at least 18 years old, have three years of professional experience and a letter of recommendation from an experienced Mganga. An eleven-member council then decides on her application Massage healer Mwanahija Mzee kneads evil spirits, so-called djinn. Doctors had diagnosed an incurable disorder in the infant's brain, but Abdulis mother prefers to put her trust in Mzee. Mzee is one of about 340 officially registered traditional healers in Zanzibar, an island belonging to Tanzania Traditional custom: fifty-six year-old Mzee learnt the art of traditional healing from her parents. She has been caring for patients for 20 years. Six times a week she is available to them from the early hours of the morning in her clinic in Zanzibar City. Many women stand in line with their children in front of Mzee's clinic and hope for recovery Protection for the unborn child: in 2009 Zanzibar passed a law allowing the registration not only of medical practices using traditional medicine, but also of traditional and alternative healers. About 2000 of these healers are still waiting to be licenced. Haji Mrisho is one of them. He treats pregnant women who want to protect their unborn baby from supernatural forces so that it comes into the world healthy From skin diseases to broken bones: shortly after little Ahee Bom was born, his skin began to darken and peel. He too received traditional treatment and was rubbed with various exfoliants made of leaves. Whether skin diseases or bone fractures, depression or exorcism: many Zanzibarans firmly believe in the powers of traditional healers Prayers for the sick: many people in Zanzibar are superstitious and believe evil spirits are responsible for physical and mental illness. Some hospitals are overstretched and have too few resources. As a result, even they recommend patients visit traditional healers. Since healers have been allowed to register, cooperation between doctors and healers has improved Conventional medicine too expensive: healer Mzee also tells of people who did not get help in the hospital and came to her. \"I am better, I know more about my patients. People don't die with me,\" she says. Mzee often prescribes herbs or plants that are cooked and drunk. Many people also resort to alternative methods because they cannot afford medical treatment "}
