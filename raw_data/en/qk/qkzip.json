Q: I don't feel well - I don't think it is COVID but can't be certain - what should I do? A: Do not come to campus or any Sonoran clinics. Since COVID symptoms range widely, if you are a clinical student and have any of the symptoms listed below, immediately contact your healthcare provider for scheduling of care AND report the symptoms in the [Qualtrics](https://southwestnm.qualtrics.com/) system. Please do not attend any clinical shift while symptomatic - including virtual clinical shifts. Symptoms: Fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea. Note: This list does not include all possible symptoms. Please check the [CDC symptom list](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) as more information is known about COVID-19. NOTE: Attending a shift while ill is considered a violation of Sonoran's Student Handbook [Code of Conduct.](https://sonoran.edu/studenthandbook) Q: What happens miss clinical rotations due to quarantine? A: ND clinical students are required to make up missed clinical rotations due to quarantine. Students who are requested to quarantine as a precaution due to COVID testing protocols should speak with their clinic faculty on the best way to make up missed rotations. In most cases, there is a virtual option that a student may attend if they are asymptomatic. In some cases, that is not an available option and other ways to make up missed shifts will need to be examined. The process will be as follows: Q: Can I opt to attend virtual clinical rotation instead? A: Only when virtual rotations are available and a clinical student is quarantined and asymptomatic, may they participate in virtual clinical rotations. Students who are symptomatic with any illness should focus on recuperating and should not be participating in virtual clinical rotations. Q: As an ND student, what if I don't have the technological support or equipment at home to participate in alternative modes of learning? A: Information Technology Services provides members of the Sonoran community support. Please contact [IT@sonoran.edu](mailto:IT@sonoran.edu). The Sonoran Library also works to safely accommodate students who do not have reliable internet access at home. Q: What library resources are available for students? A: See \"Library Access and Printing\" Q: Is ND New Student Orientation still scheduled to occur? A: Yes, New Student Orientation (NSO) for our ND students contains both self-paced (asynchronous) and live components. The self-paced (asynchronous) portion of NSO will open 60 days prior to start of the program and requires a commitment of a total of 6 hours. The live component of NSO requires daily attendance and begins the Monday prior to start of program. Admitted ND students will receive information on NSO shortly after admission. ** Title IV: Financial Aid and Government Assistance Q: Will my student financial aid disbursement be interrupted? A: No, financial aid disbursements will continue as planned for the Summer quarter and be available on Friday July 9th upon enrollment verification. Q: Can I come to campus and pick up my check in person? A: Students are urged to receive financial aid disbursement checks via mail.

A: Yes, please contact [BusinessServices@sonoran.edu](mailto:BusinessServices@sonoran.edu) for information on signing up for direct deposit with Sonoran. ** International Students Q: Can new F or M nonimmigrant (I20) students outside the United States obtain a visa to study in the United States if their program of study will be fully online? A: Whether an individual is eligible to receive an F or M visa is a decision that must be made by the U.S. Department of State and is not made by SEVP. Consistent with the SEVP Broadcast Message dated March 9, 2020, DSOs should not issue a Form I-20, \"Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,\" for a student in new or Initial status who is outside of the United States and plans to take classes at an SEVP-certified educational institution fully online. As a result, new or initial nonimmigrant students who intend to pursue a full course of study that will be conducted completely online will likely not be able to obtain an F-1 or M-1 visa to study in the United States. If a nonimmigrant student was enrolled in a course of study in the United States on March 9, 2020, but subsequently left the country, that student likely remains eligible for a visa since the March 2020 guidance permitted a full online course of study from inside the United States or from abroad. The March 2020 guidance applies to nonimmigrant students who were actively enrolled at a U.S. school on March 9, 2020, and otherwise complying with the terms of their nonimmigrant status. Q: Can new nonimmigrant students apply for a visa to enter the United States for a hybrid program of study with online components beyond the limitations at 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G)? A: Whether an individual is eligible to apply for an F or M visa is a decision that must be made by the U.S. Department of State and is not made by SEVP. However, per the March 2020 guidance, nonimmigrant students seeking to enroll in a program of study that includes in-person and online components beyond the limitations at 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G), are able to maintain F-1 or M-1 nonimmigrant status if pursuing such programs during the fall 2020 school term. Nonimmigrant students in New or Initial status after March 9, 2020 will not be able to enter the United States to enroll in a U.S. school as a nonimmigrant student to pursue a full course of study that is 100 percent online. Q: Can nonimmigrant (I20) students, who were on F1 or M1 nonimmigrant status prior to March 2020, remain in the United States if their school switches from traditional in-person or hybrid instruction to fully online instruction? A: Nonimmigrant students pursuing studies in the United States for summer 2020/21 school term may remain in the United States even if their educational institution switches to a hybrid program or to fully online instruction. The students will maintain their nonimmigrant status in this scenario and would not be subject to initiation of removal proceedings based on their online studies. If a student violates U.S. laws or regulations, they could potentially be subject to removal. Q: Can nonimmigrant (I20) students remain in the United States in a hybrid program of study with online components beyond the limitations at 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G)? A: Nonimmigrant students may remain in the United States in a hybrid program of study, which consists of both in-person and online components beyond the limitations at 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G). Students will not face enforcement action or loss of their nonimmigrant status based on engaging in hybrid programs. If a student violates U.S. laws or regulations, they could potentially be subject to removal. Q: Will continuing nonimmigrant (I20) students be able to return to the United States if they are continuing their studies outside of the country as a result of COVID-19? A: Students who continue to make normal progress in their course of study remain eligible for admission into the United States. However, because of the changing array of travel restrictions, nonimmigrant students should refer to their local embassy's website through the U.S. Department of State for any updates about visa issuance. Also, DHS and CDC websites both provide information about current travel restrictions to the United States. Q: Where can I find out about the 2020 CARES Act passed on March 27, 2020, and how those funds were used by Sonoran? A: The Federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act made funding available to colleges and universities to assist eligible students who were impacted by on-campus COVID-19 financial disruption. Please visit [Sonoran's Financial Aid](https://sonoran.edu/admissions/financial-aid/) page for more information. Q: How can I work from home from a tech standpoint? A: Most Sonoran employees have been assigned Sonoran laptops. These laptops are configured to allow you to work from anywhere - you only need an Internet Connection. You can access Outlook (email, calendar, etc.) using the Outlook client on your computer or over the web at [http://365.sonoran.edu](http://365.sonoran.edu). Faculty members can access Canvas (where applicable) at [http://canvas.sonoran.edu](http://canvas.sonoran.edu). Your office phone voicemail can be forwarded to your Sonoran email account - please contact the IT Department to facilitate this. This alerts you to new voicemails via your email account - you can listen to the email attachment and call the person back. Using a free app called Google Voice, you can forward your calls to a local (480 area code) number that runs as an app on your IOS or Android phone. When you make calls using this app, your real mobile number is hidden in the recipient Caller ID - it is replaced with the Google Voice number. Contact the IT Department for assistance. Q: Since students will not be returning to campus for several weeks, do I still have to come to work? A: All employees should continue to report to work from their remote location. Only employees deemed necessary for campus operations will in on campus. Any employee wishing to visit the campus for any reason must receive prior approval from their manager. Upon approval, you must inform Facilities in advance to let them know where you will be on campus and the length of your expected stay. Q: What considerations are being made for staff who are at risk of severe illness from COVID-19? A: If you cannot perform your work duties from home, your manager and human resources will work with you to evaluate your situation and explore potential solutions. Q: Will there be reductions in workforce or pay? A: Staff will continue to work their scheduled hours and receive regular base pay. Opportunities for overtime work may be impacted. Any changes to your schedule will be communicated by your manager. Q: Will my benefits be affected? A: There will be no changes to college benefit plans. Q: What if I become ill with COVID-19 and my sick time accrual is already depleted or becomes depleted during my time off? A: Employees who have depleted their sick leave balances will have the ability to take additional sick time as needed without penalty. For other health-related absences, employees should follow regular procedures for using their sick time and requesting a leave of absence. Q: When can I return to work following a positive COVID-19 test? A: All community members should stay home, if ill, for at least a period 24 hours (5 days if COVID positive). You must notify the Dean of Students (Students), or Human Resources (Employees), and will be placed on Quarantine Protocol, if you are exhibiting any of the following infectious illness symptoms: Any person placed on Quarantine may request from the Dean of Students or Human Resources to return to campus once the following conditions have been met: Upon return to campus after the release from quarantine, returning students and employees will be required to wear an N95-type mask for the next 24 hours while on campus. Added Cigna Resource: During times like these, many may experience worry that can become overwhelming. Cigna is providing resources free of charge for all customers, clients, and communities to help manage high stress and anxiety. We've opened a 24-hour toll-free help line ( [1.866.912.1687](tel:1-866-912-1687)) to connect people directly with qualified clinicians who can provide support and guidance. More information is available on [Cigna.com/newsroom](http://Cigna.com/newsroom) Q: How is the college planning for a potential outbreak of COVID-19? A: The college's response to COVID-19 is being led by the Sonoran COVID Response Team. The Team has outlined a COVID Exposure Procedure which documents the steps each community member is expected to take if they believe they may have been exposed to COVID. Q: What should I do if I think I have COVID-19? A: Please refer to the COVID Exposure Procedure on [my.sonoran.edu](http://my.sonoran.edu/) if you have been on campus. If you have not been on campus, according to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Do not go in person to any medical provider without first speaking to medical staff over the phone for advice. Q: What should students, faculty and staff do to minimize the risk of transmitting the disease on campus? A: The college strongly recommends following CDC prevention guidelines, including: For all students and employees that have traveled and who plan to travel in the foreseeable future: Employees and students who are coming back from high-risk areas are required to self-monitor. If you become symptomatic, you are required to self-isolate and should contact your health care provider. Please direct staff concerns to Human Resources Please direct student concerns to the Dean of Students Please direct faculty concerns to the Dean of Naturopathic Medicine As case numbers and situations change, please monitor and use the CDC Travel Recommendations by Country and state by state travel restrictions. [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html) While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not generally issue advisories or restrictions for travel within the U.S., cases of COVID-19 have been reported in many states and some areas are experiencing community spread of the disease. The CDC has noted that crowded travel settings, like airports, may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19, if there are other travelers with COVID-19. With this in mind, the college is limiting college-funded travel within the U.S. and internationally. Dear Sonoran Community, The Summer term is here and that means an increased number of people back on campus, especially indoors trying to stay cool. All this indoor time in enclosed spaces, has increased the spread of COVID-19 in Arizona. Additionally, we will see people from around the country and around the world, return to campus after going through crowded airports and riding on confined transportation, perfect climate for viral spread. Based on current CDC recommendations and COVID Task Force review of viral spread patterns at the start of a new term, the best defense is still the simplest method: wearing a mask indoors. Therefore, to maximize the safety of everyone on campus, effective July 5, 2022, the COVID Task Force is requiring all community members to wear masks inside all campus buildings and affiliated clinics. You still do not need to wear a mask if you are in a room by yourself, such as in an office or private study room but required to do so if sharing that space. We also reiterate the value of social distancing as well and implore everyone to take all COVID-like symptoms seriously by reporting them to the appropriate person and following the Sonoran Qualtrics COVID reporting process by visiting [this link](https://southwestnm.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_71WrhRox2dYpLJs). The Task Force will review masking requirements again after one month to determine if they can be modified back to prior requirements similar to the end of last term. In the interim, everyone is asked to be considerate of others, wear your mask without objection, and be kind so we can all get through a difficult time together. We are resilient! Dear Sonoran Community, The COVID-19 Task Force utilizes Sonoran's Core Values to inform our safety precautions. We Do the Right Thing, We Are Resilient, and We Love have guided all of our decisions. We commend our community for demonstrating your commitment to these values while following our safety protocols. The Task Force again utilized the best evidence in public health and considered our unique role as a healthcare institution while reviewing the newest CDC guidelines. As always, we have weighed our responsibilities to provide the best educational opportunities to our students and protect the safety and health of our students, employees, and patients. We are excited to announce the following changes to our on-campus safety protocols: N95 or medical-grade masks are now RECOMMENDED in the following places: N95 or medical-grade masks are still REQUIRED in the following places: The following additional changes will be made: The following policies will not be changing at this time: All COVID-19 documents on MySonoran will be updated to reflect these changes in the coming weeks. N95 and medical grade masks will still be available in the clinics and at the CC front desk. Please Note: Reporting Guidelines within the Qualtrics Verification System (for COVID-type symptoms, potential exposure or a positive test) and testing protocols have not changed, and are always available for viewing on MySonoran (must be logged in): [Sonoran COVID-19 Reporting Guidelines](https://my.sonoran.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=c8e53955-f5c4-4e77-a1a3-7caf1f0e72de). The Task Force will continue to monitor incident levels on campus and adjust our policies as needed. We encourage all community members to continue doing their best to ensure the safety and wellbeing of us all. Thank you for your continued commitment to Sonoran. Sincerely, Dr. Jessica Mitchell - Dean, School of Naturopathic Medicine Kenneth Donnelly - Dean of Students Mary Catellier - Director of Human Resources Sonoran Executive Council - Dr. Paul Mittman, Dr. Garrett Thompson, Dr. Michelle Cromwell, Edward Podol, Melissa Winquist Dear Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine Students, We are elated to announce a significant increase in on-campus learning this Spring Quarter. Thank you for your continued dedication to the naturopathic profession and our community's health and wellbeing. The Sonoran Community's collective efforts - masking, social distancing and the COVID-19 Testing and Vaccination Policy - have resulted in no recent campus transmission of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, making it possible to dramatically expand our in-person experiences. Didactic courses offered on-ground More on campus spaces To maintain health and safety and keep the campus open, we require these ongoing COVID-19 safety protocols: Thank you to every Sonoran student for your resilience, positivity, and understanding, during this challenging time. We also want to thank our faculty and staff for their continued dedication to ensuring Sonoran's Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program achieves excellence. We hope and pray that this pandemic doesn't throw any new curveballs that could warrant a change of these plans. We are excited to see you on campus. Sincerely, Sonoran Executive Council Dear ND Students and Sonoran Community, Thank you for your continued dedication to the naturopathic profession and our community's safety. The successful implementation of our COVID-19 Testing and Vaccination Policy has increased our ability to safely open up more space on campus. We are excited to continue our phased re-opening of the campus this winter. Please read this entire message carefully. For the Winter 2022 quarter: More courses will be available on-ground In-person Clinical Skills Assurance Checks (CSACs) and Skill Development Sessions will continue LIMITED space is available on campus for students Students requiring a place to attend online courses on campus (due to having an on-campus class, lab or clerkship immediately preceding or after) will receive permission to take classes on-campus. Please contact Nancy Gripman to schedule as this requires advanced planning/approval. The following COVID-19 safety protocols will remain in effect All students and employees must have a current COVID-19 test or proof of vaccination in the Qualtrics system to be on campus. Please refer to the [COVID-19 FAQ](https://my.sonoran.edu/ICS/Coronavirus_(COVID_-19)_FAQ.jnz) page on MySonoran for the latest up-to-date campus safety information. Please remember to follow all safety measures while on campus: Symptom reporting If there is an exposure on campus, Sonoran will contact the individuals exposed and have them isolate at home until it is safe to return to campus. These steps will help our successful campus reopening: Students who cannot meet these criteria or do not wish to return to campus should work with Academic Advising to take online courses only, request a modified schedule from APPC, or make alternate arrangements such as a leave of absence. Please note: these changes will result in a minimum 6 month graduation delay. Thank you to our students for your continued strength, resilience, and positivity during this challenging time. I want to also thank our faculty and staff for your continued dedication to ensuring the naturopathic program at Sonoran Achieves Excellence. In Health, Jessica Mitchell, ND Dean, School of Naturopathic Medicine Dear students, staff, and faculty, During eight discussion forums, hundreds of you shared your convictions, perspectives, opinions, and insights on how to safely fulfill Sonoran's mission during this dangerous phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. We thank you for your time and energy in advocating your positions. Your input, as well as that from alumni, public health officials, college presidents, patients, scientific literature, Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, and other government agencies, helped shape this difficult decision. In addition, Sonoran's Board of Trustees met twice this week, ensuring every Trustee could attend, to discuss this important issue. After much input from the Sonoran Community, President's Council voted today to formalize the attached Vaccination Policy revisions, effective November 1, 2021. The updated sections are highlighted. As you read it, note that currently enrolled Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine students and/or currently employed staff or faculty are addressed in the first part. The second part addresses newly enrolled ND students and/or employees whose enrollment/employment begins after November 1, 2021. Here are summaries of the attached policy: Details and instructions on testing, reporting, a FAQs page, and other operational information will be forthcoming. If you have specific questions to be addressed in the FAQs, please reply to this e-mail with your question. We are charged with the responsibility to protect the health and safety of Sonoran's patients, students, staff, and faculty, and continue to provide the best possible medical education and patient care. We understand that decisions on this issue will not be popular with everyone. However, we are confident that we are doing the right thing, with love, and with respect. Please accept this with open minds and hearts. Yours in Health, Executive Council Paul Mittman, ND, EdD Melissa Winquist, MA Garrett Thompson, DC, PhD Edward Podol, MBA Counseling services are available to students and employees Dear Sonoran Community, As the COVID-19 case rate continues to climb in Arizona, the College will provide all on-ground students and employees with increased levels of protection. Starting now, Sonoran is instituting the following measures to further protect our community: Students, staff, and faculty are urged to wear masks whenever you are out in public. Research has confirmed the effectiveness of mask-wearing in decreasing transmission of SARS-CoV2. Please do not let your guard down just because you are off campus. Yours in health, COVID-19 Task Force Editor's Note (8/27/2021): As Sonoran is a healthcare facility, masks and proper sanitization methods including hand washing are required at all times while on campus. If you are ill or pose a health risk to others, please do not come to campus. The implementation of the suggested actions is at the discretion of each individual student and include, but are not limited to, receiving a full series of a COVID-19 vaccination, limiting off-campus activities that may expose you to the virus, limiting exposure to large groups, and avoiding unnecessary travel. July 26, 2021 Dear ND Students and Sonoran Community, Two characteristics at the core of science are: 1) Accepted wisdom is provisional - it is subject to ongoing research and fact-checking over time; and 2) The scientific community, not an individual or group, bears the responsibility and authority to assess and reassess over time accepted wisdom through research and publication. Throughout the pandemic, we've done our best to adhere to both principles. We have adapted to the pandemic's changing circumstances and emerging research. And we've adopted best practices drawn from the scientific literature and with guidance from County, State, and Federal Public Health departments to maintain the safety of the Sonoran Community and fulfill our mission. With this in mind, we would like to thank you for your continued dedication to the naturopathic profession and our community's safety. We are excited to continue our phased re-opening of the campus this fall. Please read this entire message carefully. Please note that courses held on-ground will not have an online alternative. Students requiring a place to attend online courses on campus (due to having an on-campus lab or clerkship immediately preceding or after) will receive permission to take classes on-campus. Please contact Nancy Gripman ( [n.gripman@sonoran.edu](mailto:n.gripman@sonoran.edu)) to schedule as this requires advanced planning/approval. No other campus access will be allowed - including the yoga studio, gym, and study rooms on the second floor of the Community Commons. Please refer to the [COVID-19 FAQ](https://my.sonoran.edu/ICS/Coronavirus_(COVID_-19)_FAQ.jnz) page on MySonoran for the latest up-to-date campus safety information. Please remember to follow all safety measures while on campus: If there is an exposure on campus, Sonoran will contact the individuals exposed and have them isolate at home until it is safe to return to campus. Students who cannot meet these criteria or do not wish to return to campus should work with Academic Advising to take online courses only, request a modified schedule from APPC, or make alternate arrangements such as a leave of absence. Please note: these changes will result in a minimum 6 month graduation delay. Thank you to our students for your continued strength, resilience, and positivity during this challenging time. I want to also thank our faculty and staff for your continued dedication to ensuring the naturopathic program at Sonoran Achieves Excellence. In health, Jessica Mitchell, ND Dean, School of Naturopathic Medicine Dear Sonoran students, staff and faculty, Welcome back. I hope you got some rest and rejuvenation over the holidays. Thank you to Sonoran's faculty and staff who spent much of the last several weeks planning a Winter Quarter that maintains the highest quality learning experiences in the fields of naturopathic medicine and clinical nutrition. Yesterday, Sonoran physicians and Medical Center staff braved chilly January weather to conduct over 100 rapid COVID-19 tests. The College implemented this internal testing blitz to safely expand 3rd and 4th year medical students' participation in on-campus patient care in anticipation of a post-holiday surge in COVID cases. We planned a one-week testing blitz to start the Winter Quarter but will likely continue conducting increased testing until the infection rate diminishes. Given the limited supply of test kits, Sonoran cannot test every student, staff, or faculty member. Our priority is to test those caring for patients, participating in clinical training, and providing essential Campus services. Therefore, only those individuals whose work or clinical training requires it should be on campus. Testing is but one facet of a holistic approach to campus safety. Please continue to practice social distancing, mask wearing, and proper hand-washing and personal hygiene throughout your daily activities. By doing so, we will continue to Achieve Excellence in safely fulfilling our mission to educate, to treat patients, and discover new therapies. Thank you! Yours in health, Paul Mittman, ND, EdD President/CEO Please view this video update on from Drs. Thompson, Mitchell, and me regarding Winter quarter. Dear Sonoran ND Students, Of the many decisions college and university leaders make, the most critical are decisions that affect the academic experience and those concerning the safety of students, staff and faculty. Some are clear cut - especially those required by accrediting bodies, the department of education or the state. In other cases, the data must guide our decisions. In other words we let are evidence-based. This is what we did throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to fulfill our commitment to achieve academic excellence and to do the right thing by safeguarding the Sonoran Community's health and safety. Last month, the data - COVID-19 infection rates, hospitalizations and deaths supported a measured January return to campus. This has changed significantly over the past two weeks. Dr. Garrett Thompson, Vice President of Academic Affairs, has been daily tracking this data since March. The current trends mirror those in June that preceded the summer surge in cases. He and I conferred with key public health officials and each expressed alarm at the upward trend leading into the holiday season. All three recommended to stick with distance learning for our winter quarter. Bottom Line: The Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program will remain mostly virtual through the winter quarter. However, since patient care is considered an essential service, physicians, and students in quarters 10, 12 and 14, will expect to attend clinic rotations in person. Sonoran continues to screen all Campus visitors, and recently received shipment of the rapid-COVID testing device ordered in July. In cases of suspected COVID exposures on campus, staff, faculty and students receive free testing. We will continue to take CDC and AZDHS precautions to ensure the health and safety of the Sonoran Community. I want to thank everyone in the Sonoran Community who is working so diligently and adapting to the pandemic's changes to ensure that the Sonoran experience achieves excellence and maintains the safety of our students, staff, faculty and patients. Yours in health, Paul Mittman, ND, EdD President/CEO Dear Sonoran Medical Students, Master of Science in Clinical Nutrition Students, Staff and Faculty, Two diseases, one acute the other chronic, make this Summer Quarter like no other. A global pandemic and a gut-check on the history, legacy and devastation of racism in America challenge us to do better - as individuals, a school of medicine & health sciences, and as a nation. Though beset with concern, anger and grief, we have a mission to fulfill - to train the next generation of healers and leaders, to help patients and discover cures. Please log in to MySonoran's COVID-19 FAQ page to review three key documents - Summer 2020 Campus Plan, COVID Exposure Procedure, and Summer 2020 Clinical Expectations Rapid Reference Sheet. Dr. Jessica Mitchell led a team of staff and faculty who compiled these guidelines and best practices from the State and County Departments of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and personal communication with Public Health officials. These documents will doubtlessly evolve and improve as we continue to learn more about preventing and treating COVID-19. If you have a need to be on campus, please log in to MySonoran's COVID-19 FAQ page to review key documents - Summer 2020 Campus Plan and COVID Exposure Procedure. A team of staff and faculty compiled these guidelines and best practices from the State and County Departments of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and personal communication with Public Health officials. These documents will doubtlessly evolve and improve as we continue to learn more about preventing and treating COVID-19. At the June 22nd Board of Trustees (Zoom) meeting, the conversations and experiences shared by 36 attendees (half were guests) united and cemented our determination and commitment to move beyond the sentiment of diversity, equity and inclusion and into the space of action, education and lasting change. This was the most memorable Board of Trustees meetings in my 23-year tenure at Sonoran. Board of Trustee Emeritus, Dr. Rufus Glasper and Trustee Dr. Duane Roen led a discussion on diversity, equity and inclusion after all Board Members and attendees watched a compelling [keynote to the natural products industry by Ijeoma Oluo](https://vimeo.com/425666230), author of the best-selling book So You Want to Talk About Race. Inspiring outcomes of the meeting included a permanent Board Agenda item on Diversity, Board support for increasing diversity in the composition of Sonoran's Board, staff and faculty. The Board helped initiate a campus-wide collaboration with ASU's Center for the Study of Race and Democracy and the CSRD Director, Dr. Lois Brown. I can't predict the exact path moving forward, but I'm positive it won't be a straight line. The ongoing and daily twists and turns make evidence-based decision-making and open communication more important than ever. I invite your insights and input in navigating this historic period safely, effectively and with love and compassion. During the next two months we will hold regular Town Halls open to the Sonoran Community - students, staff and faculty. We will share the latest updates, seek your feedback and suggestions, and answer questions. Together we will not just fulfill Sonoran's mission, we will strive to achieve the highest ideals of health with its many expressions and determinants. Yours in health, Paul Mittman, ND, EdD President/CEO Dear Sonoran Community, Yesterday launched the Fall Quarter and the beginning of Sonoran's academic year. Most of you are returning, hopefully after some rest and rejuvenation, whether as students, staff or faculty. Others are new, particularly the 86 students beginning their journeys in the Master of Science in Clinical Nutrition Class of '22, and the 96 students in the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine Class of '24. A heartfelt welcome to you, and to the new members of our staff and faculty. The year ahead poses opportunities and challenges for the College and for each of us as individuals. Thanks to staff and faculty's hard work, planning and innovation, Sonoran is well-positioned to fulfill its mission even during the pandemic. Our goal is to return to campus as soon as possible, hopefully this winter. Accomplishing this goal depends on factors outside our control - the pandemic's impact on public health - and others that we do control. The most important factor that we do control is the health and safety of ourselves and the Sonoran Community. This begins with Primum non Nocere, first to do no harm - to ourselves and to others. Our personal and Sonoran's health and safety depends on our individual actions and decisions. Sonoran's COVID-19 Task Force has met throughout the course of the pandemic to ensure safe operations to protect our patients, students, staff and faculty. For those who will be on campus this fall, the Task Force established campus safety guidelines outlined in documents available on [MySonoran](https://my.sonoran.edu/ICS/Documents.jnz). Since the Sonoran Campus is private property it is our right to require temperature checks for everyone, social distancing and mask wearing. How we each act off-campus is another matter. Our off-campus safety is just as important as when we are on-campus. Please follow the public health guidelines to stay safe and healthy. Nearly all are common sense precautions - wear a mask when in public, maintain social distancing, wash/sanitize hands, avoid high risk areas if at all possible (e.g., bars, indoor dining at restaurants, etc.). When venturing out is necessary, be extra careful about maintaining these same behaviors. Keeping COVID-19 at a low rate within our community will increase our ability to transition back to campus. Each of us has a responsibility to ourselves and our community. Conscientiously adhere to safe practices - do it for yourself and for each other. Yours in health, Paul "}
