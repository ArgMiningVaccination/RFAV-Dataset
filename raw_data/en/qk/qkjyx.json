This nucleoside is included in elasomeran Drug Substance in place of the normal uridine base to minimise the indiscrimina te recognition of the elasomeran mRNA by pathogen- associated molecular pattern receptors (e.g., toll -like receptors) (Desmet and Ishii 2021). The cap structure used in the mRNA is identical to the natural mammalian Cap 1 structure ( Kozak 1991; for the prefusion stabilized -2. After intramuscular (IM; deltoid) injection, cells at the injection site take up the lipid nanoparticle, effectively delivering the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into protein. The mRNA delivery system is based on the principle and observation that cells in vivo can take up mRNA, translate it, and express viral protein antigen(s) in the desired conformation. The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently. The protein undergoes post - translational modification and trafficking resulting in properly folded, fully functional spike glycoprotein that is inserted into the cellular membrane of the expressing cell(s). ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk glycoprotein is membrane bound, mimicking the presentation of natural infection. The expressed spike glycoprotein of SARS -CoV -2 is then recognized by immune cells as a foreign antigen, which elicits both T -cell and B -cell responses. The immune response to the spike glycoprotein results in functional antibody (Ab) and T -cell responses and in the generation of memory immune cell populations. A modified, variant -matched bivalent COVID -19 mRNA vaccine has been developed that contain s equal amounts of two mRNAs that encode for the Spike protein of the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 (Wuhan- Hu-1) and an antigenically divergent variant of ), each encapsulated into individual lipid nanoparticles , and co - formulated into a single drug product (Spikevax bivalent). After delivery, both mRNAs are delivered to cells in the body where the two distinct spike protomers, each of which represents one of the three components of the spike trimer, are expressed. After expression these spike protomers assemble into the spike trimer and both homotrimers as well heterotrimers (mixed protomers from the Wuhan spike and the Variant spike), form. The inclusion of both the original and the variant spikes in the vaccine are intended to broaden immunity. Inclusion of the Wuhan spike allows reactivation and boosting of memory immune cell populations, increasing immunity that was previously present. In addition, inclusion of the variant spike, which has novel functional epitopes present primarily on the receptor binding domain ( RBD ) and the N-terminal domain ( NTD) , allows new na\u00efve immune populations to be engaged and new memory responses to be elicited. This likely broadens immunity not only to the spike antigens delivered but likely also against a broader diversity of spike proteins. Furthermore , the formation of heterotrimers with spike protomers from both the Wuhan and Variant spikes results in spike trimers that are able to flex more significantly than homotrimers, resulting in more presentation of the receptor binding domain in an \"open\" or \"up\" conformation, versus the \"closed\" conformation seen predominantly in homotrimers. In the open conformation, key sites of neutralization not exposed when the spike is closed are available, providing the immune system with more functional sites with which to engage.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS -CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS -CoV). An outbreak of the CoV disease (COVID -19) caused by the 2019 novel CoV (2019- nCoV, later designated SARS -CoV -2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, a nd has spread globally ( WHO 2020a and WHO 2020b). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID- 19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020; however, by that time, there was already widespread community transmission in many locations. As of 25 January 2023, over 664,873,023 confirmed cases and 6,724,248 deaths have been attributed to the COVID -19 pandemic globally ( WHO 2023a ). Widespread community transmission of SARS -CoV -2 has been reported in all WHO regions (WHO 2020a and 2020b). WHO has continued to track Variants of Concern (VOC): current circulating VOCs as of subvariants (WHO 2023b). Incidence of COVID -19 in Europe Following the identification of SARS -CoV -2 and its global spread, large epidemics of COVID -19 occurred in Europe. By mid- March 2020, the W HO European Region had become the epicentre of the pandemic, reporting over 40% of globally confirmed cases. As of 25 January 2023, 32.4% of global mortality from SARS -CoV -2 was from the European Region ( WHO 2023a ). The 14- day case notification rates collected by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) from 28 countries ranged from 11.0 to 611.6 per 100,000 population in the week 3 ending on 22 January 2023. This pooled rate has been decreasing for five weeks with rates per 100,000 population being <40 in twelve countries, 40-<100 in eight countries, 100-<300 in five countries (France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Slovenia) and 300 or higher in three countries (Austria, Cyprus and Greece). No countries reported increases in incidence (ECDC 2023a ). During the same period (the week 3 ending on 22 January 2023), the 14- day COVID- 19 death rate for the EU/EEA, based on data collected by ECDC from official national sources for 26 countries ranged from 0.0 to 34.3 per million population, with rates 20 or higher in five countries (Croatia, Greece, Latvia, Slovenia, and Sweden) (ECDC 2023a ). The below table presents key epidemiology indicators per country. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan Table 2: 14-Day Case and Death Notification Rates in the EU/EEA (Week 3 ending 22 January 2023) Country Case Rate (14-day notification per 100,000 population) Death Rate (14-day notification per million population) EU/EEA (pooled) 110 8.3 Austria 322.5 9 Belgium 33.6 7.2 Bulgaria 23.6 5.5 Croatia 90.5 33 Cyprus 611.6 16.7 Czechia 35 5.5 Denmark 57.9 5.5 Estonia 51 15 Finland 33.6 12.8 France 115.2 13.9 Germany 181.3 3.4 Greece 551.4 34.3 Hungary 15.3 NA Ireland 54 6.2 Italy 170.5 11.1 Latvia 23.3 24.8 Liechtenstein 56.3 0 Luxembourg 208.9 14.2 Malta 57.7 5.8 Netherlands 23.5 0 Norway 19.1 NA Poland 11 3.2 Portugal 41.4 11.4 Romania 32.3 2.5 Slovakia 27.8 1.8 Slovenia 248.8 25.6 Spain 31.5 3.9 Sweden 54.8 24.8 NA= not available Figure 1 displays the case s and death s in the EU from 01 March 2020 to 29 January 2023 (Mathieu 2023). An overall improvement in the COVI D-19 epidemiology was seen in 2023. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Plan Figure 1: COVID- 19 Case s and Death s in the EU per Million People, 7 -Day Rolling Average , 01 March 2020 to 29 January 2023 Variants of concern (VOC) and Variants of interest (VOI) Since the outbreak of the COVID -19 caused by the 2019 novel CoV began in Wuhan, in December 2019, the WHO proposed labels for global COVID -19 variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI) (WHO 2022a ). Delta was originally documented in October 2020 in India and Omicron first documented in various countries in November 2021. The WHO current VOC are the Omicron subvariants. There are currently no circulating VOI listed by WHO (WHO 2022a ); however, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control lists BA.2.75 and its sub -lineages, BQ.1 , XBB its sub- lineages), XBB.1.5 as variants of interest as of 26 January 2023 (ECDC 2023b). Among the nine countries (Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Sweden) with an adequate volume of sequencing or genotyping for weeks 1 to 2 (2 to 15 January 2023) , the esti mated distribution of VOC or VOI ranged from 48.4- 76.0% in seven countries for BQ.1, 11.3 -76.9% in nine countries for BA.5, 6.6- 27.8% in eight countries for six countries for seven countries for XBB, eight countries for BA.2, eight countries for BA.4 (ECDC 2023c ). Age specific Case Notification rates The 14-day case notification rate was significantly higher among elderly populations during the first 3 months of the pandemic. However, this shifted in late 2021 and early 2022, with younger age groups ( <50 years old) having the highest case notification rate. This increase in notification rates in younger population groups can be explained by an increase in testing rates exacerbated by a relaxation of nonpharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) as older population groups achieve ModernaTX, Inc. Plan booster doses ( ECDC 2023d). By the end of week 3 of 2023 (week ending 22 January 2023), pooled rates of case notification have continued to decrease following the small increases that were observed during December 2022 across all age groups ( ECDC 2023d) . Incidence Among Adolescents in the EU/EEA Country- level and pooled case -based data reported to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) in the EU/EEA countries indicate that case notification rates among adolescents have decreased after the peak in late 2021 and early 2022 (ECDC 2023d) , which coincided with the predominant circulation of BA.1 variants (Our World in Data 2023). Country- level 14-day age- specific notification rates of new COVID -19 cases were available for 26 EU/EEA countries as of week 3 of 2023 (i.e., week ending 22 January 2023) in TESS y (ECDC 2023d). In children and adolescents < 15 years -old, the 14 -day notification rate s per 100,000 population ranged from 4.57 in Greece to 270.00 in the Netherlands. Among people aged 15-24 years , the 14 -day notification rates per 100,000 population ranged from 7.35 in Spain to 258.92 in Austria . Incidence of COVID -19 in the US Figure 2 below presents the trends in COVID -19 weekly cases per 100,000 population by age group from 01 March 2020 to 21 January 2023 from US CDC COVID Data Tracker (CDC 2023a ). The older population saw slightly higher incidence than younger population in January 2023.

Surveillance data are provisional, and as additional clinical date data becomes available, the care rates over time are subjective to change. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan Figure 3 below presents the trends in COVID -19 deaths per 100,000 population by age group from 01 March 2020 to 21 January 2023. The death rates are still higher in the elderly age groups compared to the younger age groups (CDC 2023a ).

As of 7 January 2023, t he top three predominant VOC based on reported genomic sequencing results in the BQ.1 (18%) . The of XBB.1.5 was projected to increase to 61% by 28 January 2023 ( CDC 2023f ). Risk Factors for severe COVID -19 outcomes Age Age has been identified as an independent risk factor for severe COVID -19 disease outcome (Booth 2021). Older adults (especially those ages 50 years and older) are more likely than younger people to be admitted into the hospital or intensive care for COVID -19, or die from SARS -CoV2 infection. Medical conditions According to the US CDC (CDC 2023b) , many conditions were found to have a conclusive increased risk for at least one severe COVID -19 outcome in at least one published meta -analysis or systematic review or underwent the US CDC systematic review process: as thma, cancer, ModernaTX, Inc. EU chronic kidney disease, chronic lung diseases (bronchiectasis, COPD, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary hypertension), chronic liver diseases (cirrhosis, non- alcoholic fatty liver disease, al coholic liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis), cystic fibrosis, diabetes, heart conditions (such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies), mood disorders including depression, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, dementia, obesity, pregnancy and recent pregnancy, HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus), primary immunodeficiencies, solid organ or blood stem cell transplantation, use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications, smoking, disabilities including Down syndrome, and tuberculosis. Similar risk factors and risk groups were identified by ECDC (ECDC 2023e ). Main Existing Treatment Options Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals and therapeutic strategies to treat severe SARS -CoV -2 infections have intensified and there is an urgent public health need for rapid development of novel prophylactic therapies, including vaccines to prevent the spread of this disease mainly of the new variants. As of Ja nuary 2023, six vaccines have been authorized for COVID prevention in the European Union including: Comirnaty \u00ae from Sanofi Pasteur . In addition, there are four adapted vaccines authorized for use in the EU, including: Comirnaty Moderna. are currently under rolling review (Sputnik V [Gam -COVID (Vero Cell) Inactivated from Sinovac (EMA 2023 ). The cumulative uptake of COVID -19 vaccines among adults ( 18 years old) as of week 3 of 2023 was 84.8% for at least one dose, 82.4% uptake of the primary course, and 65.4 % uptake of first booster dose, and 16.9% uptake of second booster dose reported from 30 EU/EEA countries ( ECDC 2023c ). During the same period, 26.7% of paediatric population (<18 years old) received at least one dose of COVID -19 vaccines. In the US, two vaccines were approved (BLA): Comirnaty\u00ae from Pfizer (23 August 2021); and Spikevax\u00ae from Moderna (31 January 2022) . Other vaccines authorized for emergency use include: Janssen (FDA 2023 ). In addition, the following medicinal products have been authorized in the European Union: Kineret (anakinra) IgG1monoclonal antibodies . Additionally, the marketing authorisation for ModernaTX, Inc. a medication that works by introducing errors into the SARS -CoV -2 virus' genetic code is under marketing authorization evaluation by the EMA ( EMA 2023) . In the US, a variety of treatments have been authorized by FDA for Emergency Use (FDA 2023) , such as antiviral drugs - Veklury (remdesivir) for adults ce for certain adults with COVID -19; and COVID -19 convalescent plasma with high titres of anti -SARS -CoV -2 antibodies in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment . Natural History of COVID -19 in the Unvaccinated Population Current evidence suggests that SA RS-CoV -2 is primarily transmitted via direct contact or person - to-person via respiratory droplets by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual (whether symptomatic or not). Airborne transmission may be possible during certain medical procedures and in indoor, crowded and poorly ventilated environments ( WHO 2020c ). Common symptoms of COVID- 19 include fever and cough, and other symptoms can include shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, muscle aches, chills, sore throat, headache, and loss of tas te or smell. In comparison to ancestral SARS -CoV -2, Delta and Omicron BA.1 have shorter incubation periods, estimated as approximately 3.7- 4 days for Delta and approximately 3- 3.4 days for Omicron BA.1. Higher infectious viral loads were detected in patien ts infected with Delta than in patients infected with Omicron BA.1 or ancestral SARS -CoV -2 (Puhach 2022) . Overall patterns of shedding dynamics are conserved between SARS -CoV -2 variants. Infected children appear to shed SARS - CoV -2 virus with nasopharyngeal viral loads comparable to or higher than those in adults (Heald - Sargent 2020; DeBiasi 2021) . The spectrum of illness can range from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia with acute res piratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Among 72,314 persons with COVID -19 in China, 81% of cases were reported to be mild (defined as no pneumonia or mild pneumonia), 14% were severe (defined as dyspnea, respiratory frequency 30 breaths/min, SpO 2 93%, PaO 2/FiO 2 < 300 mmHg, and/or lung infiltrates > 50% within 24 to 48 hours), and 5% were critical (defined as respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure) ( Chowdhury 2020). The abnormalities seen in computed tomography of the chest also vary, but the most commonly observed are bilateral peripheral ground- glass opacities, with areas of consolidation developing later in the clinical course. Imaging may be normal early in infection and can be abnormal in the absence of symptoms. The circulating variants of SARS -CoV -2 evolves rapidly with different transmissibility and virulence. The Omicron variant, like other variants, is made up of several lineages and Sublineages, and share similar systems to previous variants. However, Omicron spreads more easily than earlier variants, including the Delta variant, and tends to cause less severe illness and death in general (CDC 20 23c; Wolter 2022) . Common laboratory findings of COVID -19 include leukopenia and lymphopenia. Other laboratory abnormalities have included elevated levels of aminotransferases, C -reactive protein, D -dimer, ModernaTX, Inc. While COVID -19 is primarily a pulmonary disease, emerging data suggest that it also leads to cardiac, dermatologic, hematological, hepatic, neurological, renal, and other complications (Gavriatopoulou 2020) . Thromboembolic events also occur in patients with COVID -19, with the highest risk in critically ill patients. The understanding of immunity against SARS -CoV -2 is still incomplete. Binding antibodies (bAb and neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to SARS -CoV -2 have been shown to develop in most individuals between day 10 and day 21 after infection ( Ni 2020; Seydoux 2020; To 2020). Reviews of the published literature indicate that most patients develop IgG seropositivity and nAb following primary infection with SARS -CoV -2 in > 91% and > 90% of cases, respectively. T -cell responses against the SARS -CoV -2 spike protein have been characterised and correlate well with immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA Ab titres in COVID -19 patients, which has important implications for vaccine design and long- term immune response ( Braun 2020; Grifoni 2020; Weiskopf 2020). In general, more people were tested positive for infection -induced SARS -CoV -2 antibodies in US and Europe by 2022, with the highest seroprevalence in the paediatric population (Clarke 2022; Castilla 2022 ; Kislaya 202 3). During December 2021 to February 2022, the overall seroprevalence of infection- induced antibodies in US increased from 33.5% to 57.7%, with the highest seroprevalence in February 2022 among children under 12 years old (75.2%), followed by 74.2% in children aged 12 -17 years, 63.7% in adults aged 18- 49 years, 49.8% in adults aged 50- 64 years, and 33.2% in adults aged 65 years (CDC 2023d) . Similarly, d uring 26 April to 03 June 2022 the overall seroprevalence of infection -induced antibodies in Navarre, Spain was approximately 59% and decreased with advancing age, with the highest seroprevalence in children aged 5-17 years old (85%) (Castilla 2022 ). In Portugal, although t he overall of infection- introduced antibodies was lower ( 27.3% ) during 27 April to 08 June 2022, a steep increase (12\u201430%) in N IgG seroprevalence was also observed for all age groups from the last survey in October \u2014 December 2021 (Kislaya 2023) . Various studies indicate that most patients mount an immune response following a SARS -CoV -2 infection, but that this immunity may wane over time. More recent studies found that antibody titres peak between 3 to 4 weeks after infection and remain relatively stable up to 4 months after infection ( Gudbjartsson 2020). Neutralizing activity also starts to decline after 1 to 3 months from symptom onset, as recently reported in a series of longitudinal studies on convalescent patients Pr\u00e9vost longevity of the Ab response to SARS -CoV -2 is still to be determined, but it is known that Ab levels to other CoVs wane over time (range: 12 to 52 weeks from the onset of symptoms) and homologous reinfections have been documented ( Wu 2007; Kellam 2020). Reinfection by SARS -CoV -2 under endemic conditions would likely occur with medians ranged from 16 to 22 months after peak antibody response through natural infection (Townsend 2021; Townsend 2022) . Several observational studies report that at least two exposures to S protein, through vaccination and/or infection, provide a degree of protective immunity (Goldberg 2022; but the protection against wanes with increasing since the last immunity -conferring event. A systematic review and meta- analysis of 65 studies from 19 different countries showed protection from re -infection from ancest ral, alpha, and delta variants declined over time but remained at 78.6% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 49 .8-93.6) at 40 weeks, while protection against re -infection by the omicron BA.1 variant declined more rapidly and was estimated at 36 .1% (24 .4-51.3) at 40 weeks. On the other hand, protection against severe disease ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan with 90.2% (95% UI 69.7-97.5) for ancestral, 88.9% (84 .7-90.9) for omicron BA.1 at 40 weeks (Team 202 2). Most children and adolescents appear to have asymptomatic or non- severe symptomatic SARS -CoV Forrest 2022) . SARS -CoV -2-related death in children and adolescents is rare (Smith 2022) . However, COVID -19 can lead to severe outcomes in children and adolescents (Marks 2022; Shi 2022; Presto n 2021) . For example, coinciding with increased circulation of the Omicron variant in US, COVID -19-associated hospitalisation rates among children and adolescents aged 0-17 years in late December 2021was about four times that of the Delta variant peak, yet the proportions of hospitalised children and adolescents requiring ICU admission (Delta = 27.8%; Omicron = 20.2%) or IMV (Delta = 6.3%; Omicron = 2.3%) were significantly lower during the Omicron period (Marks 2022) . Most common chronic conditions associated with hospitalised paediatric patients are diabetes, gastrointestinal, neurological, cardiac, and pulmonary diseases, specifically asthma and obesity, but some of these conditions may not be necessarily causally associated with COVID -19 (Forrest 2022; Bailey 2021) . Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) is a rare but serious condition associated with COVID- 19 in which different body parts become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. It can affect people who are younger than 21 years old (MIS -C) and adults 21 years and older (MIS -A) (CDC 2023e ). The usual duration between acute infection and onset of MIS -C symptoms is two to 12 weeks (Dufort 2020; Ahmad 2021) . In contras t to acute COVID -19 infection in children, MIS -C appears to be a condition of higher severity with 68% of cases having required critical care support (Radia 2021 ). MIS shares features with other paediatric inflammatory syndromes such as Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome. Post-acute sequelae of SARS -CoV -2 are characterised by a wide range of persistent symptoms such as fatigue, d yspnoea, chest pain, cognitive impairment, and sleeping disturbances that can last weeks, months or even years after infection (Davis 2023; Soriano 2022) . Studies show that around 10- 20% of people infected by SARS -CoV -2 may go on to develop symptoms that have been diagnosed as \"long COVID \" It is estimate d that more than 17 million people across the WHO European Region may have experienced some form of post -COVID symptom persistence during the first two years of the pandemic (2020/21) (WHO 2023c ). However, the exact numbers of those living with \"long COVID\" is uncertain, partly because of a lack of consensus of a case definition (Soriano 2022) . A systematic review and meta -analysis by ECDC indicate that the risk of post COVID- 19 condition may be higher amongst individuals who experience more severe COVID -19 disease (ECDC 2022) . Current and future risks to populations for post COVID -19 condition in the context of increased levels of vaccination and hybrid immunity remain unknown. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan Module SII - Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification Table 3 summarises the key nonclinical findings and their relevance to safety in humans. In summary, t he nonclinical package, which consisted of both studies performed with elasomeran and with mRNA va ccines formulated in the same SM -102 lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccine matrix to support elasomeran use in human, shows no important identified or potential risks. A developmental and reproductive study with elasomeran in female Sprague- Dawley rats was completed in December 2020 with no adverse findings. Table 3: Key Safety Findings From Nonclinical Studies and Relevance to Human Use Study Type Important Nonclinical Findings Relevance to Human Use Safety pharmacology and toxicology Vaccine enhanced disease and specific ERD studies Several nonclinical studies (e.g., disease pathology, immunoprofiling) in several species have been generated to address the theoretical risk of disease enhancement with elasomeran . In summary, vaccination with elasomeran generated a balanced ratio of IgG1 to IgG2a in mice, indicating a Th2 -biased response is not observed. Robust neutralizing antibodies were induced post -vaccination in mice, hamsters, and NHPs following vaccination with elasomeran , with the indication of a Th1 dominant T -cell profile in mouse and NHP models. T -cell response was not measured in hamsters. This strengthens the argument that disease enhancement similar to that observed with previous RSV and measles vaccines is unlikely to be observed. After challenge, viral load and levels of replicating virus were measured in both the nasal passages and lungs of mice, hamsters, and NHPs. In animals vaccinated with higher doses of elasomeran , complete protection was observed. In animals dosed with low levels of elasomeran , some level of protecti on was evident, with no indications of increased viral load, demonstrating that ERD is not occurring. In addition, lung histopathology analyses after viral challenge in mice, hamsters, and NHPs post-vaccination is also reassuring, as these animals did not have evidence of enhanced disease. See further description below in text. These nonclinical results show a lack of vaccine- enhanced pulmonary pathology post -challenge with elasomeran in relevant animal species. In addition, the clinical Phase 3 mRNA -1273- P301 study was designed to assess the risk of enhanced disease through continuous unblinded monitoring of cases by the DSMB with prespecified rules for determining harm based on an imbalance in cases unfavourable to elasomeran as defined in the a nalysis plan. As a result of these assessments, no safety concerns have been identified. Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism Distribution Study A biodistribution study was performed with mRNA -1647, an mRNA -based vaccine against human cytomegalovirus als o formulated in SM -102-containing LNPs. As observed with other IM -delivered vaccines, the highest mRNA concentrations were The biodistribution of mRNA -based vaccines formulated in LNPs is consistent with administration of IM dr ug products and distribution via the lymphatics. mRNA does not ModernaTX, Inc.

These tissues, as well as spleen and eye, had tissue-to-plasma AUC ratios > 1.0. Overall, only a relatively small fraction of the administered mRNA -1647 dose distributed to distant tissues (ie, lung, liver, heart, k idney, axillary distal lymph pooled], jejunum [middle region], and injection site muscle), and the m RNA constructs did not persist past 1 to 3 days in tissues other than the injection site, lymph nodes, and spleen where it persisted in general 5 days. persist past 1 to 3 days in tissues other than the injection site, lymph nodes, and spleen where it persisted in general 5 days. Repeat -dose toxicity studies Evaluation of mRNA vaccines formulated in the same SM- 102 LNP vaccine matrix) in rat administered IM at doses ranging from 9 to 150 \u00b5g/dose once every 2 weeks for up to 6 weeks. Clinical observations included generally dose - dependent erythema and edema at the injection site and transient increases in body temperature at 6 hours postdose returning to baseline 24 hours postdose were observed at 9 \u00b5g/dose. These observations resolved or were considered resolving within 72 hrs. There were clinical chemistry and hematology changes consistent with inflammatory responses (ie, increases in white blood cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and decreased lymphocytes); minimal coagulation changes consisting of a slightly increased activated partial thromboplastin time and an associated increase in fibrinogen were observed. Clinical chemistry results indicated a decrease in albumin, increase in globulin, and a corresponding decrease in albumin/globulin ratio. In general, clinical pathology changes were dose-dependent and transient. Consis tent with other indicators of systemic inflammation in response to vaccine administration, transient cytokine increases were observed at 9 \u00b5g/dose at 6 hours postdose including interferon gamma, monocyte chemoattractant 1, and macrophage inflamma tory protein 1alpha. Increased cytokine/chemokines were generally resolved by the end of the 2 -week recovery period. Macroscopic and microscopic changes were observed and included skin thickening at the Review of the toxicology data found evidence of dose - dependent treatment -related effects at the injection site and systemic inflammatory respons es to administration to the LNP. Clinical findings such as increased body temperature, injection site pain, other inflammation related findings In ongoing clinical Phase 1 and 2a studies with elasomeran , evaluation of safety clinical laboratory values of Grade 2 or higher revealed no patterns of concern. In the clinical Phase 3 mRNA -1273- P301 study, solicited local and systemic adverse reactions in the 7 days following administration, increased following the second dose. Solicited local adverse reactions, primarily injection site pain, were common. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan Study Type Important Nonclinical Findings Relevance to Human Use injection site and enlarged lymph nodes. These observations were correlated with microscopic changes that included mixed cell inflammation at the injection site; increase d cellularity and mixed cell inflammation in the lymph nodes. Additionally, decreased cellularity in the splenic periarteriolar lymphoid vacuolation and Kupffer cell hypertrophy was occasionally observed in the liver. Changes were generally reversing by the end of the 2 - week recovery period. Other Nonclinical Toxicology Studies Evaluation of elasomeran at repeat doses, non -GLP immunogenicity rat study with non- terminal endpoints Elasomeran -related clinical signs were consistent with previous GLP toxicology studies on other mRNA -based vaccines. At doses 30 ug/dose observations included transient dose -dependent injection site edema with or without hindlimb impairment were observed at approximately 24 hours postdose and generally resolved within 7 days after dose administration. Clinical pathology associated with inflammation were observed and included increased neutrophils, eosinophils, and/or globulin. Other mild elasomeran -related changes observed at 30, 60, and/or 100 \u00b5g/dose consisted of decreased red cell mass, reticulocytes, and lymphocytes and increased creatinine, triglyceride, cholesterol, and/or glucose. In general, these changes are consistent with the results from the previous GLP rat toxicity studies conducted with other mRNAs formulated in the SM -102 LNP. Reproductive/development A developmental and reproductive toxicity study was performed with elasomeran in female Sprague -Dawley rats in December 2020 with no adverse findings noted. Elasomeran was at the clinical dose of 100 \u00b5g/dose. There were no maternal effects on mating and fe rtility, ovarian/uterine examinations, natural delivery or litter assessments. Further, there were no fetal and/or pup effects on in- life parameters, gross pathology, fetal sex, external or visceral assessments, or skeletal malformations. Non - adverse, comm on skeletal variations consisting of wavy ribs and increase nodules were observed at 100 \u00b5g/dose. The no observed adverse effect level is 100 \u00b5g, which on a mg/kg basis, provides a 137 -fold safety The risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes after exposure is unknown in humans, but nonclinical findings do not suggest a specific risk. Pregnancy is an exclusion criterion in the ongoing clinical trials. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan Study Type Important Nonclinical Findings Relevance to Human Use margin to 60 -kg woman. Genotoxicity SM-102, the novel lipid used in the elasomeran LNP formulation, was evaluated in as an individual agent in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test and an in vitro micronucleus test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The results for SM -102 were negative. In addition, in vivo genotoxicity risk was assessed in a GLP -compliant rat micronucleus test using an in SM- -102 induced a minimal, statistically significant increases in MIEs in male rats at both 2 4 and 48 hours and in female rats at 48 hours only; however, there was no clear dose response, and the increases were generally weak and associated with minimal bone marrow toxicity. A second, non- GLP, in vivo genotoxicity study mRNA in SM -102 containing LNPs. In this study, there was no significant increase in the incidence of micronuclei. The results of these two studies led to an equivocal result. Given the observed increases in body temperature observed in toxicology studies it is likely that drove the slight increases observed in micronuclei formation at high systemic (intravenous) doses. Overall, the genotoxic risk to humans is considered to be low due to minimal systemic exposure following IM administration, limite d duration of exposure, and negative in vitro results. Nonclinical findings suggest that the risk to humans after IM administration is low, due to minimal systemic exposure and negative in vitro results. Carcinogenicity No carcinogenicity studies have bee n performed with elasomeran. N/A CMV = cytomegalovirus; DSMB = data safety monitoring board; ERD = enhanced respiratory disease; GLP = Good IgG Th = T -helper. Vaccine- associated Disease Enhancement There was a theoretical concern over the potential for vaccine associated disease enhancement in recipients of SARS -CoV -2 vaccines. The concern was that a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine could theoretically cause enhanced disease and specifically enhanced respiratory d isease (ERD) in vaccines that were subsequently exposed to wild- type SARS -CoV -2. The potential for vaccination against SARS -CoV -2 to be associated with disease enhancement was a theoretical concern, given similar observations with other respiratory viruses in general, and in animal models of some highly pathogenic CoVs. This concern has been triggered by preclinical work on SARS -CoV and ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk 2006; Bolles 2011), the experience with feline infectious peritonitis virus and vaccines in cats ( Takano 2008; Pedersen 2009; Pedersen 2012), and enhanced disease with respiratory syncytial virus, measles ( Kim 1969; Polack 2007), and in humans ( Smatti 2018). Importantly, vaccine -associated disease enhancement has not been seen following SARS or MERS vaccines given to humans, albeit the number of people who received these experimental vaccines remains very small. These events were associated either with macrophage- tropic CoVs susceptible to Ab-dependent enhancement of replication or with vaccine antigens that induced Ab with poor neutralizing activity and Th2- biased respons es. The Vaccine Research Center of the NIH and the Sponsor performed nonclinical studies in mice, hamsters, and nonhuman primates (NHPs) to evaluate dose - ranging responses to elasomeran (immunogenicity), high- dose virus SARS -CoV- 2 challenge (protection), a nd to address the theoretical concern of ERD mediated by vaccine -induced Ab responses and/or T helper (Th) 2 directed T -cell responses observed with other vaccines against viral respiratory diseases. These studies demonstrated that elasomeran is immunogeni c in all species assessed, showing a dose -dependent response in IgG binding Ab titres and a significant correlation between bAb and nAb activity. In addition, antigen- specific T -cell responses were observed in studies in mice and in the NHP study. Th1- directed CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell responses were measured post boost in animals that were vaccinated with elasomeran . Direct measurement of Th1- directed responses in mice and NHPs, indirect measurement of IgG 2a/c/IgG1 Ab subclasses in mice, and the high levels of nAb in all species lessens concerns regarding disease enhancement associated with administration of elasomeran . In addition to measurements of the immune response, mice, NHPs, and hamsters were challenged with high- dose SARS -CoV-2 virus. In these studies, dose levels of elasomeran that were predicted to be optimal (fully protective) and suboptimal (subprotective) were included. At higher doses, mice and NHPs were fully protected from viral replication in both lungs and nasal passages. At subprotective dose levels, animals either remained fully protected in the lungs or had reduced viral burden post -challenge versus control animals. There were no observations of increased viral load in vaccinated animals at protective or subprotective dose levels, which further supports that elasomeran does not drive enhanced disease. Lung histopathology assessments were performed to verify reduction of inflammation, immune complex deposition, and immune cell invasion in response to viral challenge in vaccinated animals versus placebo animals. In animals vaccinated with both optimal and suboptimal dose levels, histopathological evaluation of the lungs of mice and NHPs confirms the lack of ERD. This was demonstrated by the presence of minimal inflammation and lack of significan t neutrophilic -associated alveolar disease or eosinophil - dominant inflammatory response measured, which have historically been associated with vaccine - associated ERD. In contrast, moderate to severe inflammation was elicited by SARS -CoV-2 infection in phos phate- buffered saline control animal groups, which often involved the small airways and the adjacent alveolar interstitial ( Corbett 2020). These nonclinical disease pathology and immune profiling studies show immune signatures not predicted to associate with ERD and a lack of vaccine- enhanced viral replication or pulmonary pathology after challenge with SARS - CoV- 2 in relevant animal species. To further address the risk of enhanced disease, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from study participants in the Phase 1 study and restimulated to assess the cytokine prof ile post vaccination. The intracellular cytokine profile of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells reflected a Th1 - ModernaTX, Inc. EU a Th2 -directed response ( Jackson 2020). These results were reassuring since the risk of enhanced disease has been previously associated with a Th2- directed immune response. In Study mRNA -1273- P301, prespecified harm rules designed to detect an imbalance in cases of COVID- 19 or severe COVID -19 were not met. Most importantly, after a median follow -up of 2 months after the second dose of vaccine, the majority of COVID -19 cases occurred in participants who received placebo rather than elasomeran (Baden 2021), confirming no clinical evidence for vaccine enhanced disease following vaccination with elasomeran . A conclusion of safety concerns for elasomeran based on nonclinical data is summarised in Table 4. Table 4: Conclusions on Safety Concerns Based on Nonclinical Data Safety Concerns Important identified risks: Not applicable Important identified risks: Not applicable Missing information: Not applicable ModernaTX, Inc.

The study has two parts. Part 1 is the open- label, dose -escalation, age de-escalation phase. Part 2 is the randomized, observer -blind, placebo -controlled expansion phase which evaluated the selected dose of elasomeran . In total, 751 children 6 years to < 12 years of age were treated in Part 1 (380 elasomeran 50 g and 371 elasomeran 100 g) and 4002 children 6 years to < 12 years of age were treated in Part 2 (3007 elasomeran 50 g and 995 placebo) ( Table 32 to Table 39). Participants in Part 1 are distinct from th ose in Part 2. Following evidence of enhanced effectiveness of the adult booster dose (BD), study mRNA- 1273- P204 was amended to offer a BD (elasomeran, 25 \u00b5g) to all children enrolled in the 6 through 11 years age group, which could be administered starting 6 months post -dose 2 of the primary series. A total of 1,294 participants received a 25 \u00b5g BD in the Booster Dose Phase of the study.

Part A is a randomized, stratified, observer -blind, placebo- controlled study to evaluate safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of elasomeran in adults 18 ye ars of age conducted in the US. This study enrolled 30,418 participants with no known history of SARS -CoV -2 infection, but whose location or circumstances put them at appreciable risk of acquiring SARS -CoV -2 infection. Participants were randomly assigned t o receive two injections of either 100 \u00b5g of elasomeran vaccine or a placebo control given 28 days apart in a 1:1 ratio. The study enrolled adults at increased risk of complications from COVID -19 based on pre -existing medical co -morbidities. The study enrolled participants with underlying medical conditions at increased risk of severe COVID - 19 such as chronic lung disease, significant cardiac disease, severe obesity diabetes, liver disease, and HIV infection. The Part B Open- Label Observational Phase of th e study was prompted by the authorization of a COVID -19 vaccine under EUA. Transitioning the study to Part B permitted all ongoing study participants to be informed of the availability and eligibility criteria of any COVID - 19 vaccine made available under an EUA and the option to offer all ongoing study participants who request unblinding, an opportunity to schedule a Participation Decision Visit to know their ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan original treatment assignment (placebo vs. elasomeran vaccine). The Part B Open -Label Observation P hase also provided the opportunity for EUA -eligible study participants who previously received placebo to actively request to receive 2 doses of elasomeran vaccine.

No It is common medical practice to not administer a product by the intramuscular route in participants with coagulopathy or bleeding disorders although the use of a needle with proper gauge can decreased the risk. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan Criterion Reason for Exclusion Included as Missing information (Yes/No) Rationale (if not included as missing) Known history of SARS -CoV -2 infection Of note, in Phase 3 mRNA -1273- P301 study seropositive participants are not excluded from enrolment, although they are excluded from the Per-Protocol cohort. Allowance of this condition would confound assessment of safety and efficacy. No Baseline SARS -CoV -2 status was negative for most participan ts in Study mRNA -1273- P301. Testing occurred on the day of vaccination with Dose 1, and results were available subsequently. In the Safety Set, 347 participants in the elasomeran group had positive baseline SARS - CoV -2 status (Source Table 14.1.3.2.2). Has received or plans to receive a non-study vaccine within 28 days prior to or after any dose of IP (except for seasonal influenza vaccine which is not permitted within 14 days before or after any dose of vaccine). Allowance of this condition would confound assessment of safety and efficacy. Yes* Not applicable. Immunosuppressive or immunodeficient state, asplenia, recurrent severe infections (HIV positive participants with CD4+ T -cell count 350 cells/mm 3 and an undetectable HIV viral load within the past y ear [low level variations from 50 - 500 viral copies which do not lead to changes in antiretroviral therapy are permitted). Allowance of these conditions would confound assessment of efficacy. Yes* Participants with stable HIV infection were enrolled in Study mRNA -1273 -P301 (n=176).

No It is common practice to not give blood prior to entry in a clinical trial. There is no suspected biological reason to expect the safety or efficacy of elasomeran in these participants would be different from the rest of the population receiving elasomeran . * No longer safety concerns in the RMP. SIV.2 Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development Program Rare Adverse Drug Reactions The vaccine exposed pop ulation of the Phase 3 mRNA- 1273- P301 study allowed the detection of rare events with a frequency of 1/10,000 persons or 0.01%. Most rare AEs of special interest (AESIs) for post -marketing safety surveillance have incidence rates lower than the 2/10,000 persons or 0.02%. Adverse Drug Reactions of Long Latency The current vaccination regimen for the elasomeran vaccine consists of two doses administered 28 days apart. There is no prolonged exposure to elasomeran . The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently, with a rapid degradation of the mRNA as demonstrated in the nonclinical biodistribution study; thus, no long- term sequalae due to vaccine exposure are expected. In both the elasomeran injection group and the placebo group in the Phase 3 mRNA- 1273- P301 study, the median follow -up time after randomization for the entire period up to the data cut -off for database lock (including Part A and Part B) was 212 days (ra nge: 1 to 243 days). The median duration of follow -up from randomization to the PDV/unblinding (i.e., Part A) before the data cut -ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan off date was 148 days (range: 30 to 241 days). For participants who received both injections, the median duration of follow -up after the second injection to the data cut -off for database lock (including Part A and Part B) was 183 days (range: 1 to 218 days), or approximately 6 months. Therefore, with additional follow up time there has been more opportunity to observe potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that might occur with more prolonged latency. SIV.3 Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under -Represented in Clinical Trial Development Program Table 96: Exposure of Special Populations Included or Not in Clinical Trial Development Program Type of Special Population Exposure Paediatric participants Studies are ongoing in paediatric patient groups ages 6 months to < 12 years and 12 years to < 18 years . Clinical trial data from Study mRNA -1273- P203 that includes 12 years to < 18 years participants are presented in this RMP. On 23 Jul 2021, EMA (CHMP) has recommended granting an extension of indication for the COVID -19 vaccine Spikevax (previously COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna) to include use in children aged 12 to 17 years. In ongoing Study mRNA -1273- P204 , 751 children 6 to < 12 years of age have been exposed to elasomeran (380 elasomeran 50 g and 371 elasomeran 100 g) in Part 1 ( Table 14.1.5.1) and 4002 children 6 to < 12 years of age ( 3007 elasomeran 50 g and 995 placebo) in Part 2 (Table 14.1.5.2 (Data extraction date: 10 November 2021 )). A total of 1294 children 6 to < 12 years of age were administered a booster dose (elasomeran 25 g) in the Booster Dose Phase of the study ( Table 14.1.6.2 (Data extraction 23 May 2022)). On 02 March 2022, EMA (CHMP) recommended granting an extension of indication for the COVID -19 vaccine Spikevax to include use in children aged 6 to 11 years. In Study mRNA -1273 -P204, a total of 224 children 2 to < 6 years of age were exposed to elasomeran (69 elasomeran 25 g and 155 elasomeran 50 g) in Part 1 ( Table 14.1.5.1) and 4038 children 2 to < 6 years of age were treated in Part 2 (3031 elasomeran 25 g and 1007 placebo) ( Table 14.1.5.2 (Data extraction date: 21 February 2022)). Furthermore, 150 children 6 months to < 2 years of age were exposed to elasomeran 25 g in Part 1 ( Table 14.1.5.1) and 2350 children 6 months to < 2 years of age were treated in Part 2 (1761 elasomeran 25 g and 589 placebo) ( Table 14.1.5.2 (Data extraction date: 21 February 2022)). A total of 145 children including 114 infants/toddlers 6 months to < 2 years of age and 31 children 2 to < 6 years of age treated in Part 1 (elasomer an 25 g) were administered a booster dose (elasomeran 10 g) in the Booster Dose Phase of the study (Table 14.1.6.1 (Data extraction date: 18 August 2022)). Cumulatively, as of 17 December 2022, a total of 10,080 cases (1,224 serious and 37 fatal cases) w ith 21,597 events 2,920 serious events) reported in children <18 years of age. Of these total cases, 8,153 cases were medically confirmed. When gender was known more cases were reported in females (51.7%; 5,213 cases) compared to males (42.8%; 4,315), with small proportion of cases (5.5%; 552 cases) having no gender reported. The mean age was 13.8 years (SD: 4.6) and median age was 16.0 years (min: -1.0/max: 17.0). Majority of these cases were ModernaTX, Inc. Plan 88 Type of Special Population Exposure received from regulatory authorities (73.5%; 7,404 cases), with highest number of cases reported in United States (50.0%; 5,041 cases), EEA (22.6%; 2,282 cases), Asia (11.4%;1,153 cases) followed by Latin America (7.0%; 708 cases) and Australia (5.7%; 570 cases). Use of Spikevax monovalent and Spikevax bivalent vaccine s in paediatric population is approved (see Part I). Pregnant women Pregnant women were excluded from the clinical trials, although a small number of pregnancies were reported in the elasomeran clinical program. In mRNA -1273- P301 Part A, 16 pregnancies were reported in the elasomeran group and 11 pregnancies were reported in the placebo group. Of the outcomes known as of 04 May 2021, 1 participant in the placebo group experienced a live birth. The participant was induced due to polyhydramnios and gestational diabetes and the child was noted as having congenital anomalies. F ive participants (2 in the elasomeran group and 3 in the placebo group) experienced spontaneous abortion/miscarriage. In Part B, pregnancy was reported for 18 participants who received elasomeran in Part A and 19 participants who received placebo in Part A and elasomeran in Part B. Among the few known outcomes, spontaneous abortion/miscarriage was reported for 1 participant in the elasomeran group and 3 participants in the placebo -elasomeran group; elective termination was reported for 1 participant in the placebo -elasomeran group. A developmental and reproductive study with elasomeran in female Sprague -Dawley rats was completed in December 2020 with no adverse findings. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregna ncy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development. Cumulatively up to 17 December 2022, Moderna has received 5,131 pregnancy cases with 16,817 events (pregnancy and non- pregnancy specific), of which 5,467 events were serious, after receipt of S pikevax. Of the 5,131 pregnancy cases, 2,463 cases were medically confirmed, 1,817 (35.4%) cases were serious, and 32 had fatal outcomes. There are 53 reports classified as stillbirth but there is insufficient evidence to support a causal relation ship between S pikevax and stillbirth. Cumulatively, there have been 140 reports of congenital anomalies. Upon medical review, 64 pregnancy reports (some contain parent -child duplicates) occurred in fetuses and neonates and the other 76 reports of congenital anomalies occurred in non- pregnancy cases. Review of the congenital anomalies indicates that the anomalies are varied in type, aetiology, and critical gestational age at exposure; indicating that the anomalies have occurred as part of the background incidence rather than as a result of vacci ne exposure. Published literature has not identified any evidence of an increased risk of pregnancy, foetal or neonatal complications related to Spikevax maternal immunisation. Furthermore, published literature supports the favourable benefit/risk profile of maternal Spikevax immunisation as there is transfer of maternal antibodies to the foetus and early evidence that infants benefit from passive protection from SARS -CoV -2 infection and severe disease following maternal COVID -19 vaccination. Use of Spikeva x in pregnancy is now embedded in clinical practice and included in relevant health guidelines and the SmPC states that Spikevax can be used during pregnancy. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Plan of Special Population Exposure Breastfeeding women Lactating women were excluded from clinical trials. There have been no reports of women taking elasomeran while breastfeeding in the elasomeran clinical program. Cumulatively up to 17 December 2022, Moderna has received 2,036 lactation cases (6,922 events ) of which 527 were serious cases (2,026 serious events); no cases reported a fatal outcome. There were 508 cases medically confirmed. These cases and cases from the literature of changes in milk production, infant irritability, decreased feeding, sleepine ss/sleep disturbance, vomiting, diarrh oea, and pyrexia are consistent with the safety profile of S pikevax or what is expected in the general population ( ACOG 2007 ; UpToDate 2021; UpToDate 2022). No safety concerns related to S pikevax vaccination during lactation have been identified . Vaccination can induce cytokines which can be passed via breast milk but vaccination while breast -feeding has not been linked to adverse events in infants (Sachs 2013 ). In fact, women with fever and illness are encouraged to continue breast -feeding given the positive impact of the transfer of antibodies, which has also been reported for COVID -19 vaccines, as well as to support infant nutritional needs (UpToDate 2021 ). Use of Spikevax while breast -feeding is now embedded in clinical practice and included in relevant health guidelines and the SmPC states that Spikevax can b e used during breast -feeding . Participants with relevant comorbidities# Participants with hepatic impairment1 In the clinical trial mRNA -1273 -P301 (Part A), 104 (0.7%) participants with hepatic disease have been exposed to elasomeran (Table 14.1.6.2.8 ). While in mRNA -1273- P301 (Part 83 in placebo+elasomeran vaccine group and 104 (0.7%) in mRNA vaccine group participants with hepatic disease have been exposed (Table 14.1.3.2.2.2 (Data extraction date: 04 May 2021)). Participants with renal impairment A Phase 3b open- label safety and immunogenicity study ( elasomeran - Study mRNA -1273 -P304) in target population of approximately 220 adult solid organ transplant recipients is ongoing. Cumulatively, as of 17 December 2022, a total of 54,153 cases (246,375 events) were reported in frail individuals, which represents 8.2% of all cases reported in all popula tions (658,759 cases). Of these 54,153 cases, 1496 individuals had a medical history of chronic kidney disease. Use of Spikevax in frail individuals with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities has become fully integrated into standard clinical practice, such as inclusion into treatment protocols or clinical guidelines. Participants with cardiovascular impairment2 In the Study mRNA -1273 -P301 (Part A), 762 (5.0%) participants with significant cardiac diseases have been exposed to elasomeran (Table 14.1.6.2.8 ). While in mRNA -1273- P301 (Part 675 in placebo+elasomeran vaccine group and 762 (5.0%) in mRNA vaccine group participants with significant cardiac diseases have been exposed (Table 14.1.3.2.2.2 (Data extraction date: 04 May 2021)). Cumulatively, as of 17 December 2022, a total of 54,153 cases (246,375 events) were reported in frail individuals, whic h represents 8.2% of all cases reported in all populations (658,759 cases). Of these 54,153 cases, 2214 individuals had a medical history of coronary artery disease and 4011 individuals a medical history of atrial fibrillation . Use of Spikevax in frail individuals with unstable health conditions and ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan Type of Special Population Exposure co-morbidities has become fully integrated into standard clinical practice, such as inclusion into treatment protocols or clinical guidelines. Immunocompromised participants In the clinical development program, participants with immunosuppression were generally excluded. In Study mRNA -1273- P301 (Part A), participants with HIV who did not meet the exclusion criteria were enrolled. A total of 94 (0.6%) participants with HIV were exposed to elasomeran (Table 14.1.6.2.8) . While in placebo+ elasomeran vaccine group and 94 (0.6%) in mRNA vaccine group participants with HIV were exposed (Table 14.1.3.2.2.2 (Data extraction date: 04 May 2021)). A Phase -1273- P304) in target population of approximately 220 adult solid organ transplant recipients is ongoing. Cumulatively, as of 17 December 2022, there were 7,559 cases (31,444 events) in immunocompromised individuals, of which 2,936 were serious cases (11,514 serious events); there were 199 cases reporting a fatal outcome; 3,829 cases were medically confirmed. There was a higher number of case s reported cumulatively in females (4,785; 63.3%) when compared to males (2,567;34.0%), with 207 cases (2.7%) missing gender information. Among the reported cases, the median age was 60.0 years with a range of 0.3 year to 101.0 years (571 cases had missing age information ). Cumulatively, most of the events reported a resolved/ resolving outcome (13,482; 42.9%), with 8,482 events (30.2%) reported as not resolved. Review of the safety information has not identified any patterns/trends or specific safety concerns in the immunocompromised population. Serious events and fatal reports are heavily confounded by underlying medical conditions. The general pattern of commonl y reported adverse events in those with a medical history of immunosuppression/immune compromise or taking immunosuppressive concomitant medications is comparable to the general population. In general, public health and professional groups recommend COVID- 19 vaccination for immunocompromised patients. These recommendations highlight the likely potential benefits of COVID -19 vaccines in this population with the potential risk of more severe COVID- 19 infections, sequelae, and impact on underlying immune - media ted diseases (Botwin 2021; Briggs 2021; Spikevax in immunocompromised individuals is now embedded in clinical practice and included in relevant health guidelines and in the SmPC .

Use of Spikevax in frail individuals with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities has become fully integrated into standard clinical practice, such as inclusion into treatment protocols or clinical guidelines. 5. HIV infection In the Phase 3 mRNA -1273- P301 study (Part A), participants with HIV who did not meet the exclusion criteria have been enrolled. A total of 94 (0.6%) participants with HIV have been exposed to elasomeran (Table 14.1.6.2.8 ). While in mRNA -1273- P301 (Part 81 in placebo+elasomeran vaccine group and 94 (0.6%) in mRNA vaccine group participants with HIV have been exposed ( Table 14.1.3.2.2.2 (Data extraction date: 04 May 2021)). Cumulatively, as of 17 December 2022, there were 7,559 cases (31,444 events) in immunocomp romised individuals, of which 2,936 were serious cases (11,514 serious events); there were 199 cases reporting a fatal outcome; 3,829 cases were medically confirmed.

Part II: Module SV - Post -Authorisation Experience SV.1.1. Method Used to Calculate Exposure Moderna supply chain estimates are used to define the number of doses Spikevax distributed by country; however, administration data are tracked by health officials within countr ies receiving the vaccine. Therefore, Moderna estimates administration of Spikevax based on information retrieved through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( https://c ovid.cdc.gov/covid- data-ModernaTX, Inc. Health ( https://www.covid19.admin.ch/en/epidemiologic/vacc -doses ), vaccinations ). SV.1.2. Exposure Cumulatively, as of 17 January 2023, a total of 1,315,850,356 doses of Spikevax (Original) had been delivered to 91 countr ies and an estimated total of 773,062,084 doses had been administered. North America, Europe, and Asia accounted for approximately 90% of S pikevax doses distributed and approximately 84% of Spikevax doses administered. Low - and middle -income countries (The World Bank 2022 ) are estimated to account for approximately 13% of the doses distributed globally and approximately 13% of doses administered. Cumulatively, as of the end of the reporting period, 128,902,523 booster doses of Spikevax Bivalent .214 ( Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1) had been delivered to 41 countries and an estimated total of 70,896,388 doses had been administered. Europe, Asia, and Canada accounted for approximately 96% of doses distributed and approximately 96% of doses administered. A total of 149,722,244 booster Bivalent .222 ( Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4 -5) had been delivered to 31 countries and an estimated total of 82,347,234 doses had been administered. The US, Canada, Europe, and Asia accounted for >98% of all doses delivered and admi nistered. Extrapolating from the proportion of US vaccine recipients to estimate global use, it is estimated that 421,938,298 individuals received a first dose, 278,631,565 received a second dose, 169,254,388 received a third dose, and 66,929,884 received a fourth dose, with third and fourth doses including both original Spikevax (Original) and Spikevax bivalent booster dose formulations. Because of variation in the timing of use of Spikevax bivalent boosters and limited available global data, extrapolation from the US to estimate the use of bivalent boosters was not deemed appropriate. Information on distribution by sex, age, or receipt of Spikevax was not identifiable based on information published by ECDC at the time that the data were accessed (https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID -19/vaccine -tracker.html#distribution -tab). Part II: Module SVI - Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification Not relevant for COVID -19 vaccines. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Module SVII - Identified and Potential Risks SVII.1 Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission Important identified risks Anaphylaxis Important potential risks Vaccine- associated enhanced disease (VAED) including vaccine- associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Missing information Use in pregnancy and while breast -feeding Long- term safety Use in immunocompromised subjects Interaction with other vaccines Use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co -morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabet es, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) Use in subjects with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders SVII.1.1 Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP Not applicable SVII.1.2 Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP Not applicable SVII.2 New Safety Concerns and Reclassification With a Submission of an Updated RMP Removal of vaccine- associated enhanced disease (VAED) including vaccine- associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) as an important potential risk Vaccine- associated enhanced disease (VAED) including vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) was included as an important potential risk in the RMP at the time of initial conditional marketing authorisation for Spikevax in the EU (06 January 2021). The MAH has closely monitored VAED including VAERD and presented cumulative reviews in Monthly Safety Summary Reports (MSSRs) as well as in Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) since the EUA (18 December 2020) at the request of the EMA and other health authorities. The most recent PSUR, PSUR #4 covering the period 19 June 2022 to 17 Dec ember 2022, presents detailed data supporting the removal of VAED including VAERD as an important potential risk. A summary of the data is presented below. Vaccine- associated enhanced disease was raised as a safety concern for COVID -19 vaccines early in the pandemic, but current evidence does not suggest that this hypothetical construct presents a ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan risk. More than 772 million S pikevax doses are estimated to have been administered since the first EUA up to 17 December 2022, and it is likely that VAED would have been observed and reported if it were both confirmed and more than a very rare event. Motivation to monitor COVID- 19 vaccine recipients for possible VAED arose from sources such as animal models in which pathogenesis suggested a common potential mechanism producing VAED related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines in MERS and SARS -CoV -1 (Lambert 2020). To dat e, no pathognomonic presentation of VAED has been recogni sed following immuni sation of >902 million individuals with Spikevax vaccines. Further more , analysis of the immune profile of Spikevax in a mouse model shows elicitation of a protective immune profile that is not associated with vaccine- enhanced disease upon SARS -CoV -2 challenge ( DiPiazza 2021 ). There is currently no widely accepted case definition for VAED; however, a recent publication by the Brighton Collaboration provides some guidance for assessment of potential VAED in COVID- 19 (Munoz 2021 ). In this guidance , it is suggested that VAED may be identified first as a vaccine failure (i.e., VAED requires exposure to and infection by SARS -CoV -2 in a person who has been fully immunised). The authors acknowledge that there is presently no pathognomonic set of clinica l findings to characterise VAED. Furthermore, case classifications that can be readily applied to individual -level data from spontaneous reporting are not defined. The Brighton Collaboration working group states that a definitive case of VAED cannot be asc ertained with current knowledge of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of VAED. Probable cases must show an increase in severity or rates of atypical findings when compared to a non- vaccinated control group, however this criterion must be considered at a popula tion or group level rather than an individual level. Given that there have been numerous epidemiologic studies evaluating effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in millions of vaccinees and that there have not been findings showing an increased risk of COVID -19 di sease in vaccinees (or a subgroup of vaccinees) compared to those not vaccinated, real world evidence for occurrence of VAED is lacking. Moreover, there is an absence of medical literature supporting the existence of VAED due to Spikevax or mRNA vaccines against COVID -19. The removal of VAED including VAERD as an important potential risk is support ed by the following considerations: The MAH has monitored VAED in each PSUR since EUA (18 Dec 2020) at the request of the EMA and other health authorities. Over the years of analysis and given the amount of safety data accumulated given the unprecedent use of these vaccines, the MAH has found no evidence to support the hypothesis that this phenomenon exists or that there is a causal relationship to the vaccine. Despite the large number of doses of Spikevax that has been administered worldwide, no cases of VAED have been reported to the MAH's global safety database. As of 17 December 2022 , SARS -CoV -2 vaccines have not been associated with VAED in preclinical studies or clinical use. Even with the emergence of multiple new variants/serotypes of SARS -CoV -2, with their potential to provoke sub- neutralising antibodies in individuals who have encountered similar (but poorly cross reactive) epitopes, as was the case for SARS -CoV -2 variant Omicron, no enhancement of disease has been reported. Despite widespread use of the Spikevax vaccines (>800 million individuals vaccinated ModernaTX, Inc. EU 96 with at least one dose) there is no convincing evidence t o support the hypothesis that VAED exists or that it has a causal relationship to the vaccine. There is no reasonable expectation that the existing or future feasible pharmacovigilance activities could further characterise the safety profile of the product with respect to VAED. In conclusion, the MAH considers there is su fficient justification for removing VAED including VAERD as an i mportant potential risk from the RMP and proposes to continue monitoring VAED including VAERD through routine surveillance and ongoing post -authorisation safety studies as applicable. Removal of Use in immunocompromised subjects as missing information Use in immunocompromised subjects was included as missing information in the RMP at the time of initial conditional marketing authorisation for Spikevax in the EU (06 January 2021) as immunocompromised and/or immunosuppressed people were excluded from the pivotal clinical trials (Table 95) . The MAH has closely monitored use in immunocompromised subjects and presented cumulative reviews in MSSRs as well as in PSURs since the EUA (18 December 2020) at the request of the EMA and other health authorities. The most recent PSUR, PSUR #4 covering the period 19 June 2022 to 17 December 2022, presents detailed data supporting the removal of use in immunocompromised subjects as missing information. A summary of the data is presented below. Ongoing review of the literature finds articles that primarily d iscuss the decreased immunogenicity/effectiveness of the vaccine in immunocompromised population, the waning effectiveness of the vaccine over time, the potential benefit of boosters, including bivalent boosters in the context of the Omicron variant and subvariants, and recommendations for immunosuppressant regime management in the context of vaccination. No significant safety concerns have been identified in the literature to date. Epidemiological studies have not indicated any significantly increased risk of side -effects in immunocompromised individuals after vaccination with Spikevax, and they have indicated that the safety/tolerability profile in those individuals studied is consistent with that observed in general populations receiving S pikevax (S\u00e1ez- Pe\u00f1ataro 2022; Napuri 2022). Analyses have found a risk of hospitali sation or death from COVID -19 in those with a variety of immunocompromising conditions, including rheumatic diseases, ha ematological malignancies, solid organ transplants, and HIV ( Vijenthira 2020; Ao 2021). Factors that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 in the general population, such as older age, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and other co-morbidities, are significant dr ivers of risk in immunocompromised individuals. Moreover, some immunodeficiencies seem to increase the risk above and beyond traditional risk factors. Cumulative review of post -marketing safety data has not identified any patterns/trends or specific safety concerns in the immunocompromised population. Serious events and fatal reports are heavily confounded by underlying medical conditions. Otherwise, the general pattern of commonly reported adverse events in those with a medical history of immunosuppression/immune compromise or taking immunosuppressive concomitant medications is comparable to the general population. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan 97 In general, public health and professional groups recommend COVID -19 vaccination for immunocompromised patients. These recommendations highlight the likely potential benefits of COVID- 19 vaccines in this population with the potential risk of more severe COVID -19 infections, sequelae, and impact on underlying Briggs Currently, some countries have approved/authorised/recommend a third dose in the primary series as well as a fourth \"booster\" dose and fifth \"second booster\" in severely immunocompromised individuals, as well as a third booster dose in mildly immunosuppres sed individuals (and the general population) due to waning of immunity and the emergence of new variants. A higher percentage of reports for Dose 3 and Dose 4 during the review period of PSUR #4 (19 Jun 2022 t o 17 Dec 2022) compared to the cumulative period (18 Dec 2020 to 17 Dec 2022) likely reflects increased booster vaccination uptake and reporting of booster cases in the immunocompromised subpopulation during this period. After careful review of all new safety data for the safety topic of use in i mmunocompromised individuals , and given that this population is at an increased risk for severe COVID -19 infection, the benefit -risk profile for S pikevax remains favo urable. Over the years of analysis and the large scale of use of Spikevax (and other COVID -19) vaccines and boosters, the MAH has found: Review of the safety data in immunocompromised subjects reported in the global safety database indicates that the general pattern of commonly reported adverse events in those with a medical history of immunosuppression/immune compromise or taking immunosuppressive concomitant medications is comparable to the general population, rather than as a result of vaccine exposure. The MAH continues to evaluate use in i mmunocompromised subjects in reports of Spikevax (Original and Bivalent Boosters) via routine pharmacovigilance activities as well as through post -authori sation safety studies. Throughout the world all the EUA received for S pikevax includes recommendations for additional doses for immunocompromi sed subjects Use of Spikevax in immunocompromised subjects is embedded in clinical practice and included in relevant health guidelines and no longer constitute missing information in the safety profile of S pikevax. Data from study mRNA -1273- P304, a Phase 3b, open- label study safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA -1273 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients and healthy participants showed that the 3- dose primary series and BD of mRNA -1273 were well tolerat ed with an acceptable safety profile in immunocompromised post -transplant population. Data from study mRNA -1273- P904 showed that all AESI that met threshold for SCRI analysis in the IC population also met the threshold in the general population, and no new risks specific to immunocompromised persons were identified. A comprehensive review of the published literature did not identify any elasomeran immunization safety concerns for the immunocompromised (IC) population. The literature search yielded 579 artic les. The articles were medically/scientifically reviewed to identify ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk relevant to the safety and benefit/risk profile of Spikevax/Elasomeran in the context of the IC population. There were 402 articles that discussed COVID -19 disease or its impact on IC individuals, effect of the pandemic on the IC, therapeutic approaches for treatment of IC individuals, case reports/series, review articles and studies that did not include SPIKEVAX /Elasomeran and/or mRNA vaccines. The remaining 177 articles contain ed information regarding mRNA vaccine administration in the IC population. Most of these articles discussed information in the context of IC individuals with the possibility of lower immune response to the COVID -19 vaccine, the need for booster doses due to the waning immune response over time and the emergence of variants (Omicron) and subvariants, the effectiveness of the vaccine and risk factors for breakthrough COVID -19 and severe COVID -19 disease. The literature demonstrates that for IC individuals, the risk of COVID -19 infection is related to significant morbidity and mortality. This most recent assessment of the li terature concerning the use of Spikevax and mRNA vaccines is associated with significantly less severe outcomes in COVID -19 infections. Overall, the published data reviewed through this literature search support a positive benefit -risk of the use of elasom eran for the IC subpopulation and support the understanding of the use of the vaccine in this subpopulation. The removal of use in immunocompromised subjects as missing information is supported by the following considerations: Extended use of the Spikevax vaccines in immunocompromised individuals has provided extensive safety information in this sub- population group to no longer be considered missing information. Use of Spikevax in immunocompromised individuals is already included in the SmPC and embedded in clinical practice and included in relevant health guidelines and no longer constitute missing information in the safety profile of S pikevax. There is no reasonable expectation that the existing or future feasible pharmacovigilance activities could further characterise the safety profile of the product with respect to use in immunocompromised subjects as long- term safety is being maintained as m issing information. In conclusion, the MAH considers there is sufficient justification for removing use in immunocompromised subjects as missing information from the RMP and proposes to continue monitoring use in immunocompromised subjects through routine surveillance and ongoing post - authorisation safety studies as applicable . Removal of Interaction s with other vaccines as missing information Interaction s with other vaccines was included as missing information in the RMP at the time of initial conditional marketing authorisation for Spikevax in the EU (06 January 2021). The MAH has closely monitored interactions with other vaccines and presented cumulative reviews in MSSR s as well as in PSURs since the EUA (18 Dec ember 2020) at the request of the EMA and other health authorities. The most recent PSUR, PSUR #4 covering the period 19 June ModernaTX, Inc. Plan to 17 December 2022, presents detailed data supporting the removal of interactions with other vaccines as missing information. A s ummary of the data is presented below. The safety profile of Spikevax when co- administered with non- COVID- 19 vaccines is being monitored, including their use with the new Spikevax bivalent vaccines. As COVID -19 vaccines become available to children who are also being vaccinated against childhood infectious diseases, the safety and efficacy of coadministration is being evaluated with routine surveillance activities. Overall, cumulatively up to 17 Dec ember 2022, adverse events reported for individuals receiving non-COVID -19 vaccines concomitantly with S pikevax , were generally comparable to those seen in the general population after vaccination with non- COVID -19 vaccines and were related to reactogenicity events commonly seeing after vaccinat ion with S pikevax. A review of the data showed that events reported in individuals receiving concurrent vaccines with S pikevax continue to primarily occur in individuals >50 years of age, with a higher number of reports involving females, as it is seeing i n the general population, with a time to onset ( TTO ) of less than 7 days. Reports in the pa ediatric population comprised mainly product administration errors. The highest reported events were seen with coadministration with the influenza vaccine. Availabl e evidence on COVID -19 vaccine coadministration with influenza vaccine does not show increased adverse events. Therefore, WHO considers that coadministration of an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine and any dose of a COVID -19 vaccine is acceptable, given that the known risk of serious illness for adults infected with influenza virus or SARS -CoV -2 is substantial. The cumulative review of the safety information did not identif y any patterns/trends or specific safety concerns in individuals receiving concu rrent vaccines with S pikevax. Serious events and fatal reports we re heavily confounded by underlying medical conditions. Otherwise, the general pattern of commonly reported adverse events in those individuals receiving concurrent vaccines with S pikevax was comparable to the general population. No interactions between S pikevax and other non- COVID -19 vaccines have been observed. After careful review of all new safety data received for the safety topic of interaction with other vaccines, the benefit -risk profile for S pikevax remains favo urable. Over the years of analysis and the large scale of use of S pikevax (and other COVID -19) vaccines and boosters, the MAH has found: Review of the safety data on individuals receiving concurrent vaccines with S pikevax reported in the global safety database indicates that the general pattern of commonly reported adverse events are consistent with expected reactogenicity events and are comparable to events observed in the general population receiving other widely use d vaccines. Available evidence on COVID -19 vaccine coadministration with influenza vaccine does not show an increase in reporting of adverse events. Health authorities consider that coadministration of an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine and any dose of a COVID -19 vaccine is acceptable, given that the known risk of serious illness for adults infected with influenza virus or SARS -CoV -2 is substantial. Use of Spikevax with other vaccines, including childhood immuni sation vaccines is embedded in clinical practice and included in relevant health guidelines and no longer constitute missing information in the safety profile of S pikevax. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk The removal of i nteraction with other vaccines as missing information is supported by the following considerations: Extended use of the S pikevax vaccines in conjunction with other vaccines has provided extensive safety information for i nteractions with other vaccines to no longer be considered missing information. Concomitant use of other vaccines with Spikevax is inc luded in the SmPC : High dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine can be concomitantly administered with Spikevax. The MAH continues to evaluate i nteraction with other vaccines in reports of S pikevax (Original and Bivalent Boosters) via routine pharmacovigilance activities as well as through post -authori sation safety studies. Concomitant use of the vaccine with the influenza vaccine is already included in the product's labe lling, and the use of Spikevax with other vaccine s is embedded in clinical practice and included in relevant health guidelines and no longer constitute missing information in the safety profile of Spikevax. There is no reasonable expectation that the existing or future feasible pharmacovigilance activitie s could further characteri se the safety profile of the product with respect to interaction with other vaccines as long- term safety is being maintained as missing information. In conclusion, the MAH considers there is sufficient justification for removing i nteractions with other vaccines as missing information from the RMP, and proposes to continue monitoring interactions with other vaccines through routine surveillance and ongoing post -authorisation safety studies as applicable. Removal of u se in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co -morbidities (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) as missing information Use in frail subjects with unstable health condi tions and co- morbidities (e.g., COPD, diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) was included as missing information in the RMP at the time of initial conditional marketing authorisation for Spikevax in the EU (06 January 2021). The MAH has closely monitored use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities (e.g., COPD, diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) and presented cumulative reviews in MSSRs as well as in PSURs since the EUA ( 18 December 2020) at the request of the EMA and other health authorities. The most recent PSUR, PSUR #4 covering the period 19 June 2022 to 17 December 2022, presents detailed data supporting the removal of use in frail subjects with unstable health condit ions and co- morbidities (e.g., COPD, diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) as missing information. A summary of the data is presented below. Frail patients are considered at higher risk of complications due to COVID -19 infection including hospitali sations and deaths; and for this reason, are prioriti sed candidates for vaccination. Since frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co- morbidities were excluded from the ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk ModernaTx, Inc is characteri sing safety through post -marketing routine monitoring of adverse events in this s pecial subpopulation. Frailty refers to a state of vulnerability to stressors characteri sed by a decreased physiological reserve, resulting in poor health outcomes compared to individuals of the same chronological age ( Rockwood 2018). There is growing evidence to supporting the safety profile of the COVID -19 vaccine in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV -infected patients, diabetics, and patients with cardiopulmonary diseases, is similar t o that in the general population. Presently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, British Society for Immunology, and various other governmental and professional societies and organisations endorse COVID -19 vaccination in the immunocompromise d population. Overall, recommendations for use in patients with immunocompromising medical conditions and immunosuppressing medications on the efficacy of the vaccine may support the extrapolation into the frail subpopulation indicating potential benefits to outweigh theoretical risks. The frail population was the first sub -population group vaccinated with Spikevax and other COVID -19 vaccines given that this population was recognis ed to have the potential for more severe complications due to COVID -19 infect ion. This same recommendation is still in place for vaccination against SARS -CoV2 and its variants. Overall, t he general pattern of commonly reported adverse events in the frail subpopulation is consistent with expected S pikevax reactogenicity and comparab le to those events observed in the general population and in patients with these underlying conditions, especially the elderly. This is to be expected, as the elderly comprise 30.2% of the frail subpopulation in the reporting period of PSUR #4 . As expected with the time course of reactogenicity events observed in the general population, event clustering in the frail subpopulation was observed in the three -day window after vaccination, irrespective of dose number. Notably, reports of event term COVID -19 were much less prevalent in serious cases in the frail subpopulation (1.3%) compared to the general population (2.0%). This is likely due to the preferential roll out of boosters to this frail subpopulation in many countries. The most frequently report ed event terms in serious cases in the frail subpopulation closely match those seen both in the elderly population and in the general population as a whole. Fatal cases in the frail subpopulation in the reporting period (2.0%) were strongly confounded by m ultiple co-morbidities and the advanced age in the elderly, which comprise a little less than a third of the frail subgroup. Case reports across all available vaccines after doses 3 and above have increased as expected with uptake of booster doses administ ered in many countries in the period of PSUR #4. With this increase in booster dosing, more events were reported after dose 3 than any other dose in this reporting period. The adverse event profile observed after booster doses in the frail subpopulation is similar to that seen in the general population, notably as reactogenicity events with similar time to onset for dose 3 as after dose 1 and dose 2. The few cases reported in frail children and adolescent subpopulations did not reveal any new or unusual pat tern of events. With the scale in distribution of S pikevax bivalent vaccines to frail and vulnerable groups globally, the accumulated safety data have not revealed any safety concerns or significant novel events in the frail subpopulation or key differenc es among the various types of vaccines, compared to the general population. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan 102 The MAH has monitored use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co -morbidities in each MSSR as well as PSURs since EUA (18 Dec 2020) at the request of the EMA and other health authorities. Over the years of analysis and the large scale of use of S pikevax (and other COVID- 19) vaccines and boosters, the MAH has found: Review of the safety data in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities reported in the global safety database indicates that the general pattern of commonly reported adverse events in those frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co -morbidities is comparable to the general population, rather than as a r esult of vaccine exposure. The MAH continues to evaluate use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities in reports of Spikevax (Original and Bivalent Boosters) via routine pharmacovigilance activities as well as through post -authori sation safety studies. Use of Spikevax in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co -morbidities has become fully integrated into standard clinical practice, such as inclusion into treatment protocols or clinical guidelines and no longer cons titutes missing information in the safety profile of Spikevax. The removal of use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co- morbidities (e.g., COPD, diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) as missing information is supported by the following considerations: Extensive use of the S pikevax vaccines (>800 million individuals vaccinated with at least one dose), including in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co- morbidities, has provided extensive safety information in this sub- population group to no longer be considered missing information. The MAH continues to evaluate use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co-morbidities in reports of S pikevax (Original and Bivalent Boosters) via routine pharmacovigilance activities as well as through post -authori sation saf ety studies. There is no reasonable expectation that the existing or future feasible pharmacovigilance activities could further characterise the safety profile of S pikevax with respect to use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co- morbidities as long -term safety is being maintained as missing information. In conclusion, the MAH considers there is sufficient justification for removing use in frail subjects with unstable health conditions and co- morbidities (e.g., COPD, diabetes, chronic ne urological disease, cardiovascular disorders) as missing information from the RMP, and proposes to continue monitoring use in frail individuals with unstable health conditions and co- morbidities through routine surveillance and ongoing post -authorisation safety studies as applicable. Removal of u se in subjects with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders as missing information Use in subjects with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders was included as missing information in the RMP at the time of initial conditional marketing authorisation for Spikevax in the EU (06 January 2021) . 103 The MAH has closely monitored use in subjects with autoimmune or infla mmatory disorders and presented cumulative reviews in MSSRs as well as in PSURs since the EUA (18 December 2020) at the request of the EMA and other health authorities. The most recent PSUR, PSUR #4 covering the period 19 June 2022 to 17 December 2022, pre sents detailed data supporting the removal of use in subjects with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders as missing information. A summary of the data is presented below. Ongoing review of the literature finds articles that primarily discuss the decreased immunogenicity/effectiveness of the vaccine in the immunocompromised population, the waning effectiveness of the vaccine over time, the potential benefit of boosters, incl uding bivalent boosters in the context of the Omicron variant and subvariants, and recommendations for immunosuppressant regime management in the context of vaccination. No significant safety concerns have been identified in the literature to date. In gen eral, public health and professional groups recommend COVID -19 vaccination for patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (AI/ID). These recommendations highlight the likely potential benefits of COVID -19 vaccines in this population with the potent ial risk of more severe COVID- 19 infections, sequelae, and impact on underlying immune (Botwin 2021; Briggs 2021; Izmirly 2022; Tang 2021). note, individuals with AI/ID may be on immunosuppressive me dications, which may reduce the immunogenicity and efficacy of the vaccine and may be a risk factor for more severe COVID- 19 disease ( Duly 2022; Tallantyre 2022) . Exacerbation of autoimmune conditions can be related to inflammation caused by infections and thus it is hypothetically possible that such exacerbations could be related to the immune response to vaccines, including mRN A COVID those on immunosuppressive therapies and the hypothetical risk of disease exacerbation have been recogni sed by professional and public health organi sations, given the risk of more severe COVID -19 and sequelae, vaccination is generally recommended with monitoring and management of any potential flare or exacerbation after vaccination. Thus far, there have been no specific safety concerns identified for individuals with AI/ID. Epidemiological studies have not indicated any significantly increased risk of side -effects in individuals with AI/ID after vaccination with S pikevax. Epidemiological studies have indicated that the safety/tolerability profile in those individuals studied is consistent with that observed in general populations period for P SUR #4 and cumulatively, the most frequently reported events (pyrexia, fatigue, headache, chills, myalgia, nausea, and arthralgia) among medical history of autoimmune and/or inflammatory dise ase ( MedHx AI/ID ) cases receiving S pikevax (both Original and Bivalents) represent expected reactogenicity. The types and distribution of the most frequently reported events is comparable to those observed with S pikevax (Original) in MedHx AI/ID cases and those Bivalent .214 (Original/BA.1) or SPIKEVAX Bivalent.222 (Original/BA.4/5). During the reporting period for P SUR #4 , the potential cases of exacerbation of underlying autoimmune and inflammatory disorders reported after vaccination with S pikevax (Original and ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk bivalent vaccines) may have limited information and lack a description of the baseline disease status or historic pattern of flares, the clinical course, diagnostics/labs/imaging, treatment, outcome, clear time to on set and/or dose number. Those reports also include signs and symptoms of reactogenicity that could mimic signs and symptoms of autoimmune disease (such as fever, myalgia, fatigue, arthralgia, headache), and thus it may be difficult to fully differentiate t ransient reactogenicity from AI/ID reactivation/flare . Given the natural waxing and waning course of AI/ID, and that there are no reliable reference data of the background rates of respective flares, the cases do not represent a safety concern at this time. The MAH has monitored use in individuals with AI/ID in each MSSR as well as PSUR s since EUA (18 Dec 2020) at the request of the EMA and other health authorities. Over the years of analysis and the large scale of use of S pikevax (and other COVID -19) vaccines and boosters, the MAH has found: Review of the safety data individuals with AI/ID reported in the global safety database indicates that the general pattern of commonly reported adverse events in those with a medical history of autoimmune/inflammatory disorder is comparable to the general population, rather than as a result of vaccine exposure. Exacerbation of autoimmune conditions can be related to inflammation caused by infections and thus it is hypothetically possible that such exacerbations could be related to the immune response to vaccines, including mRNA COVID -19 vaccines. This has been recogni sed by professional and public health organi sations; yet, given the risk of the potential consequences of COVID -19 infection, som e are recommending vaccination with monitoring and management of any potential flare or exacerbation occurring after vaccination. In addition, those individuals with AI/ID may be on immunosuppressive medications, which may reduce the immunogenicity and eff icacy of the vaccine, and/or make them more susceptible to infections. Use of Spikevax in individuals with AI/ID is embedded in clinical practice and included in the SmPC and relevant health guidelines. The MAH continues to evaluate use in individuals with autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (AI/ID) in reports of S pikevax (Original and Bivalent Boosters) via routine pharmacovigilance activities as well as through post -authori sation safety studies . The removal of use in individuals with autoimmune and inflammatory disorders as missing information is supported by the following considerations: Extended use of the Spikevax vaccines (>800 million individuals vaccinated with at least one dose) has provided extensive saf ety information including individuals with autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (AI/ID) to support the removal of this population as missing information. There is no reasonable expectation that the existing or future feasible pharmacovigilance activities could further characterise the safety profile of the product with respect to individuals with autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. In conclusion, the MAH considers there is sufficient justification for removing use in subjects with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders as missing information from the RMP, and proposes to ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk 105 continue monitoring use in individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders through routine surveillance and ongoing post -authorisation safety studies as applicable. SVII.3 Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and Missing Information Table 97: Presentation of Important Identified Risks Important Identified Risk Myocarditis Potential mechanisms Myocarditis is an under -diagnosed cardiac disease resulting from any one of a broad range of infectious, immune, and toxic causes . Most cases of myocarditis are caused by infectious agents, toxic substances, drugs or autoimmune disorders. Hence, it is increasingly recognized that myocarditis is an inflammatory condition of the myocardium triggered by various factors rather than a di stinct cardiovascular disease. Infectious causes include viruses, bacteria, Chlamydia, rickettsia, fungi, and protozoa. Noninfectious triggers have been identified such as toxins, auto immunes disease and hypersensitive reactions. Numerous medications like antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine), antibiotics (penicillin, ampicillin, myocarditis. Myocarditis has been reported following many different vaccines including flu vaccine, however the smallpox vaccine has the strongest association. During the influenza epidemic of the winter 1998- 1999 there were several reports of patients who had preceding flu -like symptoms and fever and developed cardiac involvement between 4 and 7 days after the onset of influenza symptoms ( Onitsuka 2001 ). Evaluation of the post -authorization safety data suggest a very rare risk of myocarditis following COVID -19 vaccination, the mechanisms involved in such vaccine -related myocarditis are not clear based on the data currently available. Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence Data to evaluate the safety concern were derived from clinical trials and the post -authorisation safety. Characterization of risk In Study mRNA -1273-P301 (Part A), there were 15,184 participants exposed to the elasomeran vaccine, and 15,166 participants in the placebo arm. There were no reported TEAEs of Myocarditis follow -up period after vaccination. No cases have been reported in Part B of the st udy (CSR mRNA -1273- P301 addendum 1 (Safety from open label phase [Part B]). Using post authorization safety data, an evaluation of all the cases identified as cases of Myocarditis, utilizing the WHO -UMC causality assessment and the newly developed DRAFT My ocarditis Brighton Collaboration case definition (30 May 2021) was conducted. A total of 77 cases were identified. Analysis of the 77 cases that reported events of myocarditis using the WHO - UMC standardized case causality assessment revealed that there wer e 20 reports (8% of the Myocarditis cases) classified as \"Possible\" events, 11 reports were classified as \"Conditional\", 17 reports were classified as \"Unlikely\", and 29 were classified as \"Unassessable\". Of the \"Possible\" 20 cases, there were 18 males and 2 females. Their ages were between 18 and 52 years of age. The reported TTO was between 0 days and 10 days (Median= 3 days). The 20 reports that were classified as \"Possible\" according to the WHO -UMC causality assessment, were evaluated according to the M yocarditis Brighton Collaboration case definition. Out of the 20 possible reports, there were 2 classified as Level 1 (Definitive case); 12 classified as Level 2 (Probable case); and 6 were classified as Level 4 (a ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan with insuff icient evidence to meet level 1,2 or 3 of the case definition). As of DLP of this RMP, there were 362 cases of Myocarditis reported. The corresponding reporting rate of myocarditis was 3.45 per 100,000 person - years based on a 21 -day risk window following each dose of vaccine administered. Risk factors and risk groups Approximately 1% to 5% of patients that test positive for acute viral infection(s) may exhibit a form of myocarditis. The annual prevalence of myocarditis has been reported from 10.2 to 105. 6 per 100,000 worldwide, and its annual occurrence is estimated at about 1.8 million cases. Most studies of acute myocarditis report a greater prevalence and severity in male patients, speculated to be caused by a protective effect of natural hormonal infl uences on immune responses in women when compared with men ( Golpour 2021). Patients are usually between the ages of 20 and 50. Acute myocarditis and hypert hyroidism are also common diseases that often present in young, otherwise healthy patients. The spontaneous reports included in the global safety database included 4 cases that reported previous COVID -19 infection (5.9%) with these reports in the 18 to 39 years of age group. There were 5 reports of previous Myocarditis/ Pericarditis medical history (5.9%), 14 reports of cardiovascular conditions (16.5%), 5 with Thyroid conditions (5.9%), and 12 (14.1%) had previous medical histories of allergy- type conditio ns including history of anaphylaxis. Preventability Myocarditis presents with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild dyspnea or chest pain that spontaneously resolves without treatment to cardiogenic shock and sudden death. The major long- term consequence is dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with chronic heart failure. Common viral infections are the most frequent cause of myocarditis, but other pathogens, hypersensitivity reactions, and systemic and autoimmune diseases have also been implicated ( Blauwet 2009). Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination with Spikevax. These cases have primarily occurred within 14 d ays following vaccination, more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger men. Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and pers isting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. For patients presenting with myocarditis or pericarditis after the 1st dose CDC recommends deferring the 2nd dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine until more information is known. However, if heart has recovered, it could consider proceeding with 2nd dose ( Wallace 2021). Current SmPC and PIL adequately covers the information on this risk awareness to the health care professionals, caregivers and vaccinees. Impact on the benefit -risk balance of the product Based on the analysis of all the safety data, there have been very rare reports of myocarditis occurring after vaccination with Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine. Causal association between Spikevax and myocarditis is considered of at least a reasonable possibility. The majority of the cas es ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan 107 have been reported in young males, and shortly after the second dose of the vaccine. These are typically mild cases and individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis. The benefits (prevention of COVID -19 disease and associated hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths) outweighed the risks (expected myocarditis cases after vaccination) in all populations for which vaccination has been recommended ( Gargano 2021). Public health impact Myocarditis associated with vaccines typically occur at a low incidence, which results in a low public health impact. Although the potential clinical consequences of the occurrence of myocarditis is serious, this is a risk known to healthcare professionals and can be managed with early diagnosis with supportive treatment. Most observed cases have bee n of mild severity, and spontaneously resolved. Important identified risk Pericarditis Potential mechanisms Acute pericarditis is an inflammatory process involving the pericardium that results in a clinical syndrome characterized by chest pain, pericardial friction rub, changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and occasionally, a pericardial effusion. Generally, the diagnosis requires 2 of these 4 features. Epidemiologic data on the incidence of acute pericarditis are lacking, likely because this c ondition is frequently inapparent clinically, despite its presence in numerous disorders ( Imazio 2015 ). However, it appears to be the most common form of pericardial disease and a relatively c ommon cause of chest pain. It is diagnosed in approximately 0.1% of patients hospitalized for chest pain and in 5% of patients admitted to the emergency department for chest pain unrelated to acute myocardial infarction (MI). Although acute pericarditis oc curs in all age groups and in men and women, it presents most often in men 20 to 50 years of age. The most common form of acute pericarditis is idiopathic, which accounts for about 90% of cases. Other common causes include infection, renal failure, myocard ial infarction (MI), post-cardiac injury syndrome, malignancy, radiation, and trauma. Acute pericarditis is more common in men than in women. However, although this condition is more common in adults than in children, adolescents are more commonly affected than young adults. Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence Data to evaluate the safety concern were derived from the clinical trials and post-authorisation safety data. Characterization of risk In study mRNA -1273- P301 (Part A), in the safety set, th ere were 15,184 participants exposed to the elasomeran vaccine, and 15,166 participants in the placebo arm. There were four TEAE of \"Pericarditis\" in P301: Two TEAEs in the Placebo arm, and two in the Vaccine arm of the safety set in the overall stage afte r any injection. The 2 events in the placebo arm were reported in the >18 to <65 years of age. The events in the vaccination arm were reported in a male in his 60s' and a female in her 50s' . In Part B, one case of acute pericarditis (verbatim: \"acute infec tive pericarditis\") was reported in a male in his 60s' in the placebo group; the event occurred 24 days after a COVID19 diagnosis. In addition, one case of pericardial effusion was reported as an SAE (resolving) in a 20s' years old male in the placebo -elasomeran group. No participant in the elasomeran group experienced pericarditis (CSR mRNA -1273- phase [Part B]). ModernaTX, Inc. EU Important identified risk Pericarditis A review of the spontaneous reports from the company's global safety identified 68 case report s with the PTs of Pericarditis. All of the aforementioned reports were considered serious reports. As a difference with the Myocarditis reports, most of the Pericarditis reports (64.7%) involved persons >50 years of age. There was not an important difference between the reported genders, with 51% Males, and 47% females. There was not an important difference in the TTO for the pericarditis cases with 16% reporting a TTO less than 1 day, 18 % for each 2 to 3 days and 4 to 7 days. The majority of the reports reported a TTO of more than 8 days following last vaccination. Occurrence following dose 1 was very similar (37% of reports) to the one seeing following dose 2 (41%). Dose number was not reported in 22% of the cases. Evaluation of all the 68 cases identi fied as cases of Pericarditis, utilizing the WHO -UMC causality assessment, there were 18 reports that were classified as \"Possible\" according to the WHO -UMC causality assessment. Of these \"Possible\" 18 cases, there were 9 males and 9 females. Their ages were between 28 and 82 years of age (Median= 51.5). 8 reports were after the 1st dose, 9 after the 2nd dose of the elasomeran vaccine, and 1 did not provided dose information. The reported TTO was between 1 days and 23 days (Mean 11.3 days). The rest of the 68 cases that reported Pericarditis, 11 cases (16.2%) were classified as \"Conditional\"; 21 cases (30.8%) were classified as \"Unassessable/ Unclassifiable\"; and 18 (26.5%) were classified as \"Unlikely\". The post -marketing reporting rate for pericarditis (without myocarditis) was 2.16 per 100,000 person- years based on a 21- day risk window following each dose of vaccine administered. Risk factors and risk groups Acute pericarditis occurs when the bilayer pericardial sac becomes inflamed. In most cases, the cause of pericarditis is idiopathic or is assumed to be due to a viral infection for which the antecedent virus is not identified. There are several less common infectious and non -infectious causes of pericarditis, but most patients with acute pericarditis p resent with a history suggestive of recent or concurrent viral illness. Most cases resolve with no long- term sequelae. While pericardial effusions might develop as a result of pericarditis, they are usually minor and rarely result in cardiac tamponade ( Sharif 2013). Acute pericarditis is more common in men than in women. However, although this condition is more common in adults than in children, adolescents are more commonly affected than young adults. A prospective clinical cohort study in Italy identified an incidence of 27.7 cases per 100,000 person- years ( Imazio 2008 ). Another study, a retrospective analysis of Finnish registry da ta capturing admissions to 29 hospitals over a span of 9.5 years identified an age standardized incidence of 3.32 per 100,000 person- years, with higher rates in men ages 16- 65 ( Kyt\u00f6 2014 ). Pericarditis is the Congenital pericardial disorders are rare. Preventability Pericarditis may be caused by many disorders (e.g., infection, myocardial infarction, trauma, tumors, metabolic disorders) but is often idiopathic. Symptoms include chest pain or tightness, often worsened by deep breathing. Cardiac output may be greatly re duced if cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis develops. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, a ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Management Plan identified risk Pericarditis friction rub, electrocardiographic changes, and evidence of pericardial fluid accumulation on x -ray or echocardiogram ( Hoit 2020 ). Pericarditis may result in one two serious complications: cardiac tamponade and chronic constrictive pericarditis. Cardiac tamponade is considered a medical emergency and, if left untreated, can quickly become fatal. Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination with Spikevax. These cases have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination, more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger men. Availa ble data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccin ees should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. CDC recommends deferring the 2nd dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine until more information is known. However, if heart has recovered, could consider proceeding with 2nd dose ( Wallace 2021). Impact on the benefit -risk balance of the product Based on the analysis of all the safety data, it shows that there have been very rare reports of pericarditis occurring after vaccination with Moderna COVID- 19 Vaccine. Although causality cannot be established at this time, the majority of the cases have been reported in young males, and shortly after the second dose of the vaccine. These are typi cally mild cases and individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of pericarditis. The benefits (prevention of COVID - 19 disease and associated hosp italizations, ICU admissions, and deaths) outweighed the risks (expected myocarditis cases after vaccination) in all populations for which vaccination has been recommended. Public health impact Pericarditis associated with vaccines typically occur at a lo w incidence, which results in a low public health impact. Although the potential clinical consequences of the occurrence of pericarditis are serious, this is a risk known to healthcare professionals. Table 98: Presentation of Missing Information Missing Information Use in Pregnancy and While Breast -Feeding Evidence source As pregnancy was an exclusion criterion for the mRNA clinical trials, there is limited data from the use of elasomeran in pregnant women from the clinical trials. A developmental and reproductive study with elasomeran in female Sprague- Dawley rats was completed in December 2020 with no adverse findings. In post authorization, preliminary analysis of the v -Safe pregnancy registry conducted by the US CDC did not identify safety signals (Shimabukuro 2021 ). Anticipated risk/consequence of the Targeted populations of the indication will inclu de women of childbearing ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk missing information potential, thus, the use of elasomeran in pregnant and breastfeeding women may happen. Pregnancy outcome data will be collected in enhanced pharmacovigilance. An observational cohort pregnancy study will inform on the risk of adverse outcome in women who were exposed to elasomeran during pregnancy. Missing Information Long -Term Safety Evidence source Per protocols, the clinical development program has a safety follow up period of 12 months in the ongoing Phase 1 study 20- 0003, Phase 2a Study mRNA -1273- P201 and, in the Phase 3 study mRNA -1273 -P301. In the Phase 3 Study mRNA -1273- P301 the safety follow -up is based on a median duration of follow -up after the second injection to the data cut -off for database lock (including Part A and Part B) was 183days (range: 1 to 218 days), or approximately 6 months. The follow up time is through Day 209 for the Phase 1 study DMID 20- 0003 and through at least 180 days (6 months) after the most recent injection (Day 209) for the 555/600 (92.5%) participants who had not discontinued from the study before Day 209 in the Phase 2a Study mRNA -1273- P201. Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information The long- term safety profile remains to be characterised. The long- term safety profile is to be characterised through continued trial follow -up, active surveillance for safety, a European post -authorisation safety study, and routine pharmacovigilance.

EU Risk Authorisation Safety Studies) III.1 Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities The MAH has an established signal management process including signal detection, validation and evaluation of spontaneous reports from all sources. During signal detection data sources are screened for new safety information related to Spikevax. Following initial review of the available data, a determination is made on the basis of the nature and the quality of the new information whether further investigation is warranted, at which point those topics referred for further investigation are considered \"validated signals\". Potential signal detection data sources i nclude safety data from MAH -sponsored clinical trials and clinical as well as non -interventional studies, spontaneous AE reports, published literature, and communications from external sources, including regulatory agencies, and (if applicable) business partners. Moderna's PV system relies primarily on AEs contained in its global PV database (Argus platform) that captures suspected AE reports and in addition, signal from regulatory databases (eg Eudravigilance, VAERS). Routine PV also includes a periodic review of the literature that involves targeted keyword searches in widely recognised databases (i.e., MEDLINE, EMBASE). Moderna performs a weekly aggregate quantitative signal detection review of the global safety database in order to identify possible adve rse reactions. Moderna also conducts monthly safety reports that are shared with regulatory agencies worldwide. Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities Beyond Adverse Reactions Reporting and Signal Detection: Specific adverse reaction follow -up questionnaires for Spikevax Myocarditis / Pericarditis Questionnaire The questionnaire is intended to collect structured information on cases of myocarditis and pericarditis . It is intended to assist with capturing information that can support case classification using the Myocarditis Brighton Collaboration case definition ( Brighton Collaboration 2021) as well as the CDC working case definition s on Acute Myocarditis ( Gargano 2021) The Moderna signal management process for Spikevax includes signal detection, validation, prioritization, evaluation, and recommendation for actions as well as documentation and tracking of signals. It follows the principles of the Good Pharmacovigilance P ractices Module IX for Signal Management (refer to https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/post- authorisation/pharmacovigilance/good-pharmacovigilance- practices ). Moderna signal detection strategy for Spikevax is described in the product safety strategy form. It describes the data sources, type and frequency of the signal detection analyse s summarised in Table 100. As available, standard case definitions from the Brighton Collaboration will be used to classify AESIs by level of diagnostic certainty. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Risk Plan 100: Spikevax Signal Data Sources and Frequency of Evaluations Data Source Frequency of Safety Evaluations Company global safety database Ongoing monitoring of Individual Cases Safety Reports (ICSRs) from all sources, safety concerns, and Adverse Events (AE) of Special Interest. Weekly aggregated review of ICSRs for trend analyses. Review of disproportionate reporting of preferred terms (PT) during a time interval as compared to all data prior to the RP for Spikevax. Review of endpoints of interest (ie, case counts, demographics, country of origin, time to onset, seriousness, batch numbers, fatalities, AE from the product surveillance list of safety topics and based on MedDRA system organ class and high- level term, and identification of potential clusters of ICSRs. Literature Weekly literature review. Any literature abstract or article signal detection run will be reviewed. EudraVigilance Continuous monitoring. Biweekly critical review of the EudraVigilance data analysis system using available reports (i.e, Electronic Reaction Monitoring Reports [e- RMRs] and active substance groupings, ICSR line listings and ICSR f orms). VAERS Frequency of review will depend on public availability of redacted VAERS extracts. Current estimates based on public communication as well as processing time indicate this frequency will range between every two to four weeks. Generation of disproportionality scores using Empirical Bayesian Geometrical Mean and its 90% confidence intervals after new uploads of Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System extracts in Empirica Signal. Health Authorities websites Ongoing review of data published on the Safety Web Portals of selected major regulatory agencies to identify required actions regarding the product and similar products. Product surveillance to identify safety signals will occur for any reported AEs inc luding reactogenicity. Safety surveillance prioritization is for the safety concerns of the RMP, AESIs, or those AEs that may be serious or known to be often medicine related. If any cluster of events is detected which points towards an unexpected event/syndrome, Moderna will perform appropriate signal evaluation and will provide this information to the appropriate regulatory agencies. Table 101: Product Surveillance List of Spikevax Signalling Strategy By Category Category Safety Topics (Updates may be Needed if New Adverse Events Emerge) Safety concerns Myocarditis Pericarditis Use in pregnancy and while breast -feeding Long -term safety ModernaTX, Inc.

Standard safety topics Off-label Use Overdose Vaccination Administration Errors Product Qual ity Issues Drug -Drug Interactions Death Paediatric Use Geriatric Use Designated Medical Events (EMA/326038/2020) As enhanced pharmacovigilance activities and to further support signal detection, observed rates of AEs will be compared with the expected rates which will be available from the scientific literature or other sources including those reported by the EMA -funded COVID -19 vaccine monitoring ACCESS program ( Dodd 2020). Specifically, Moderna will use the AESIs agreed with the EMA to compare their observed reporting rates during the time period of the vaccination with Spikevax to the published expected incidence rates resulting from the ACCESS retrospective multi- database dynamic cohort study, conducted during the years 2017 to 2020, including the period of SARS -CoV -2 circulation in Europe. During the evaluation of validated signals, Moderna will have access to a large US population of de-identified patient level information in healthcare claims databases to conduct additional Observed to Expected (O/E) analyses in defined cohorts as well as to potentially launch inferential epidemiologic studies to evaluate these safety signals in a rapid manner. This database, used in support of US PASS protocol mRNA -1273- P903, became available for signal assessment Q32021. Reporting to EMA Valid ICSRs that fulfil the local regulatory requirements for submission to the EudraVigilance database will be submitted within the 15 - or 90- day time frame. This includes any COVID -19 cases requiring hospitalisation, vaccination administration errors, and MIS that may have been reported to occur in vaccinees. Per consideration on core requirements for RMPs of COVID19 vaccine, coreRMP19 guidance EMA/ PRAC/709308/2022, from the start of the distribution of Spikevax, Moderna regularly prepares a Summary Safet y Report (SSR) (Table 102) for submission to health authorities in complement to the submission of routine periodic reports (Periodic Benefit -Risk Evaluation Reports) . The need and frequency of submission of SSRs are re-evaluated based on the available evidence from post -marketing. SSRs and Periodic Safety Update Reports include results of the O/E analyses for AESIs as appropriate. ModernaTX, Inc. EU Spikevax Summary Safety Report s Interval and cumulative number of reports, stratified by report type (medically confirmed/not) and by seriousness (including fatal separately) Interval and cumulative number of reports, overall and by age groups and in special populations (e.g., pregnant women) Interval and cumulative number of reports per HLT and SOC Summary of designated medical events Reports per EU country Exposure data (lot distribution data total and per country) Changes to reference safety information in the interval, and current CCDS Ongoing and closed signals in the interval AESI and RMP safety concerns: report s - numbers and relevant cases, including O/E analyses Fatal reports - numbers and relevant cases, including O/E analyses Risk/benefit considerations Subsequent SSR content requirements will be defined by previous SSR assessment(s). Potential Medication Errors Large scale mass vaccination may potentially introduce the risk of medication errors related to storage, handling, dosing, and administration errors associated with a multidose vial, and confusion with other COVID -19 vaccines. These potential medication errors are mitigated through the information in the SmPC. Traceability The SmPC includes instructions for healthcare professionals to record the name and batch number of the administered vaccine to improve traceability. The vaccine carton labelling also contains a scannable 2D barcode that provides the batch/lot number and expiry date. In addition, Moderna also provides stickers (two stickers per dose, containing printed batch/lot information, product identification, and 2D bar code that encodes a unique identifier [serial number]) either in cartons or to be shipped along with each shipment, in the countries where this is required. III.2 Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities In addition to actions targeted at identified and potential risks described in the safety specifications, the MAH intends to address general safety through continued clinical trial follow -up, a European Post Authorisation Safety Study, an observational study of Spikevax using routinely collected health data in 5 European countries , which monitors safety of Spikevax in pregnancy, a US Post Authorization safety study, and a n observational study to assess maternal and infant outcomes following exposure to Spikevax during pregnancy, collecting data in the US . The immunogenicity and safety of mRNA vaccine boosters being evaluated in an open- label Phase 2/3 study. Some other study protocols will be updated to include these bivalent vaccines.

EU Risk Management Plan the medicine's webpage: www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax II Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise the Risks Important risks measures to minimise such ris ks and the proposed studies for learning more are outlined below. Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; Important advice on the medicine's packaging; The authorised pack size \u2014 the amount of medic ine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the medicine is used correctly; The medicine's legal status \u2014 the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. Together, these measures constitute r outine risk minimisation measures. In addition to these measures, information about Adverse Reactions (ARs) is collected continuously and regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment, so that immediate action can be taken, as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. If important information that may affect the safe use of available, it is listed under \"missing information\" below. In the supplemented with additional pharmacovigilance activities mentioned under the relevant important risks below. II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information Important risks risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long- term use of the medicine). ModernaTX, Inc.

Risk factors and risk groups Approximately 1% to 5% of patients that test positive for acute viral infection(s) may exhibit a form of myocarditis. The annual prevalence of myocarditis has been reported from 10.2 to 105.6 per 100 ,000 worldwide, and its annual occurrence is estimated at about 1.8 million cases. Most studies of acute myocarditis report a greater prevalence and severity in male patients, speculated to be caused by a protective effect of natural hormonal influences on immune responses in women when compared with men. Patients are usually between the ages of 20 and 50. Acute myocarditis and hyperthyroidism are also common diseases that often present in young, otherwise healthy patients. The spontaneous reports included in the global safety database included 4 cases that reported previous COVID -19 infection (5.9%) with these reports in the 18 to 39 years of age group. There were 5 reports of previous Myocarditis/ Pericarditis medical history (5.9%), 14 reports of cardiovascular conditions (16.5%), 5 with Thyroid conditions (5.9%), and 12 (14.1%) had previous medical histories of allergy -type conditions including history of anaphylaxis.

Table 109: Important Identified Risk: Pericarditis Important Identified Risk: Pericarditis Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine Data to evaluate the safety concern were derived from the clinical trials and post - authorisation safety data . Risk factors and risk groups In most cases, the cause of pericarditis is idiopathic or is assumed to be due to a viral infection. There are several less common infectious and non -infectious causes of pericarditis, but most patients with acute pericarditis present with a history sugges tive of recent or concurrent viral illness. Most cases resolve with no long- term sequelae. While pericardial effusions might develop as a result of pericarditis, they are usually minor and rarely result in cardiac tamponade. Acute pericarditis is more comm on in men than in women. However, although this condition is more common in adults than in children, adolescents are more commonly affected than young adults. A prospective clinical cohort study in Italy identified an incidence of 27.7 cases per 100,000 pe rson-years. Another study, a retrospective analysis of Finnish registry data capturing admissions to 29 hospitals over a span of 9.5 years identified an age standardized incidence of 3.32 per 100,000 person- years, with higher rates in men ages 16- 65. Peric arditis is the most common pericardial disorder. Congenital pericardial disorders are rare.
