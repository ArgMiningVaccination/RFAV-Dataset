J 1 WELCOME TO OUR SCHOOLS INTRODUCTION The refugee children in schools in the United States have fled their native countries from all over the globe. Many have experienced violence, have moved frequently, or have settled in refugee camps, living without essential resources, health care, or e ducation. They arrive in America displaced from their homelands, expected to acclimate to a culture that is often radically different from what they have known. The experience of displacement is one of the most significant traumas and losses that refugees of a ll ages can face. The lack of stability and safety, the constant disruptions, and the sometimes prolonged deprivation exact their toll on each family member. F or children, it puts them at profound developmental risk, often impairing co gnitive abilities as well as emotional, academic, or behavioral functioning. Yet when refugee children arrive in th e United States, if they are between the ages of 5 and 21, they are en rolled in an American school and expected to quickly adjust to their new way of living. Suddenly they are riding school buses; navigating school hallways, cafeterias, and locker rooms; sitting in classrooms; and trying to manage a new language, schoolwork, friendships, and after-school activiti es. The experience can be frightening, sometimes exhilarating, and overwhelming for even the most resilient children. The Welcome to Our Schools program, developed by the Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (O TDA), is designed to ease the transition of refugee children into the elementary and secondary schools of New York State, and to empower t heir parents to be effective partners in the education of their children. Refugee: one who flees in search of refuge or asylum, as in times of war, political oppression, or religious persecution 2How to Use the Welcome to Our Schools Program The Welcome to Our Schools program contains curricula and instructional materials to be used in a student Refugee Academy, Mi ni-Academies, and par ent and professional development programs. Instructors and Academ ic Coaches are encouraged to use the contents of the curriculum as a guide, tailoring the instructional activities to match the needs, concerns, and experiences of the refugee students. The Welcome to Our Schools Refugee Academy Curriculum , consisting of 16 Instructional Modules, can stand alone, or c an be integrated into existing educational programs. Instructors should review the Modules and select the materials that would be most relevant to the refugee students w ho have enrolled in their school system, and most useful when designing lesson plans and classroom activities. The Modules contain objectives, vocabulary words, classroom activities, journal topics, suggested follow-up activities, DVDs, and handouts. They can be used in any order, although it is advisable to introduce the curriculum with Module 1: American Schools and Module 2: Making Friends . Instructors should combine the Modules with activities that have worked successfully in the past and with new activities that have been developed to respond to the needs and interests of the students. The selection of Modules should always be based on the best means of helping refugee students acc limate to their new American schools. Videos The Refugee Academy Curriculum comes with videos that can be used at any time during the Academy. Instructions for using the videos are contained in the modules and in the Guide to the Videos . VIDEO TRANSLATIONS There are six DVDs, translated in to over 15 different languages. Each DVD has all five videos: A Day in Elementary School A Day in Middle School A Day in High School Refugee Student Interviews Refugee Parent Interviews The instructor will have to determine the best way to show the videos, depending upon the languages spoken by the students, the equipment available, and the number of Ac ademic Coaches and translators. 3Children's Books There are children's picture books that c an be used at any time during the Refugee Academy. The books can be used at all grade levels and can be translated verbally, read aloud in English, or just enj oyed by looking at the pictures. Instructors are advised to become familiar with the books so that the stories can be integrated into classroom activities when it seems most appropriate. The messages of the story books are all relat ed to adapting to school in Am erica, and the pictures are self-explanatory. Even older students will identify with the main characters and appreciate the themes of building confidence and develop ing comfort in an American school. Read the books aloud to the class when the students need some quiet time, or when the class discussion seems to match the co ntent of the book. The Modules do not specify when the books should be read aloud. The instructors can determine when it's time to share a story. \u0083 One Green Apple (by Eve Bunting) \u0083 The Bus for Us (by Suzanne Bloom) \u0083 Teachers (by Tami Deedrick) \u0083 My New School (by Kirsten Hall) \u0083 I'm New Here (by Bud Howlett) \u0083 The Color of Home (By Marry Hoffman) \u0083 My Name is Yoon (by Helen Recorvits) \u0083 Say Something (by Peggy Moss) 4 BACKGROUND FOR INSTRUCTORS Although instructors may have experience working with refugee families that are settling in the United States , it is essential that dur ing the Refugee Academy the instructors view the world of school through the eyes of refugee children. A new school is difficult enough for American students who know the system. Refugee children have to juggle multiple concerns as they try to adjust to schools that are fast-moving, well- established in their routines, and challenging to anyone who is new to the system. Refugee children are vulnerable , both academically and socially. Once resettled in the United States, their ability to successfully navigate the school experience is dependent upon a number of factors such as age, culture, coping st rategies, parental support, degree of interrupted schooling, and reception by the host community. The children may be living with new \"families\" who are rela tives they never met before. They may be living with host families or guardians who are responsible for their care. Some children have been exposed to extended violence in war zones and refugee camps while others have witnessed war-re lated events or deat h of family and community members. Studies of refugee children in a school environment find that exposure to war and persecution can resu lt in significant delays in academic achievement. Depression, aggressive behavior, immaturity and physical ailments such as headaches and stomachaches are found to be common in the refugee school-aged population. All of these interf ere significantly with the learning process. The students need attentive school staff, ex tra individual att ention, and intensive support to tackle not only the academic concerns, but the social, emotional, material and health concerns as well. Parental/guardian involvement in school is strongly associated with positive outcomes in academic pe rformance and school behavior. In the case of refugee children, adjustment can be eased through parental involvement. Such involvem ent includes: creating a time and place at home to do homew ork; monitoring homework; encouraging and facilitating school attendance; alerting the school to problems or issues as they ar ise which may affect their child's performance or behavior; managing health care of the student; staying informed of student progress and grades; monitoring quality of school services; and communicating with teachers, including parti cipation in parent/teacher conferences and the school Open House. But many factors inhibit parental involvement in their child's education life. First, language serves as a major barrier. Re fugee parents are unable to comprehend the telephone call that reports the child is absen t from school (or is sick and needs to go home). They cannot understand notes sent home from the teacher. The homework is incomprehensible. They may be unaware of school events. Many do not participate in 5important parent/teacher conferences because of their inability to understand English, or because of their discomfort around teachers and other authority figures. Furthermore, parents are oft en unaware of community re sources or unable to access them, and need an advocate who can help them find ways to meet their own needs. In addition, refugee parents lack understanding about the workings of American school systems and may find the instit ution and the educational process intimidating. They are unfamiliar with New York State education law, rights and responsibilities, and obligations. They are not aware of the range of opportunities in schools, including academic, extra-curricular, and vocationa l programs. Mandatory school attendance may be a brand new concept, and they may hav e little understanding of the school's expectations of them as partners in the education of their children. At the same time, American schools are not usually linguistically or culturally equipped to meet the special needs of refugee children. The schools st ruggle with language barriers and lack of information about the cu ltural background and history of the students. While most schools welcome refugee children, they are often anxious about communicating with the refugee children and their families. Teachers find that strategies, policies and expectations that accommodate the needs of their current students do not always work well for refugee children. School distri cts do not usually have the resources and are not set up to prov ide intensive orientation or to tailor curriculum and educational services to the specific and varying needs (academic, language, behavioral, cognitive) of the re fugee student population. Schools find age- appropriate grade level placement challenging for students who lack a background of formal schooling or who have experienced signifi cant interruptions in their education. Refugee children are often le ft on their own to master a new language, decipher expectations, and figure out how the American school system functions. Recognizing the backgrounds of the re fugee students, the Bu reau of Refugee and Immigration Affairs has created a Welcome to Our Schools program that consistently emphasizes three themes in the Refugee Academy curriculum: \u0083 Expose students to all asp ects of the American educational program so that they are familiar with how education works in their new country. \u0083 Encourage students to take advantage of the multiple benefits of an American education. \u0083 Reassure students that they will successfully adjust to their new schools. 6 Instructors in the Refugee Academy should never assume that refugee students, no matter what their age and background, have basic knowledge about what school is like in America. For example the follo wing scenario is typical of an American elementary classroom and the per spective of a refugee student: In a recent fourth grade class, the teacher announced that it was time for recess. The students moved quickly to grab their jackets, hats, and gloves, and put on their boots. Then they lined up, talking excitedly, and headed outside to play. A new refugee student sat in her sea t, afraid to move. She had just come from living in a series of villages, where \"school\" was the occasional gathering of children wit h very strict adults who punished them if they spoke. Classes were often disrupted by violence or the urgent need to escape to a refugee camp or hiding place. She often fled with the clothes on her back and no shoes, holding tightly to the hand of her older sister. She did not know what recess was, and had no idea where the students were going and if they would ever come back. S he could not understand wh y the students were talking so loudly, risking corporal punishme nt from the teacher . She watched as the children piled on layers of unfamiliar clot hing and then willingly went out into the cold. She watched out the window as they ran laughing around the playground and then settled in groups that played with balls and ropes. The teacher asked her if she would rather color than go outside, and handed her a box of crayons. She did not know what it meant to \"c olor\" and did not know what to do with the \"crayons.\" It was all so confusing and discouraging when everyone else seemed to know exactly what to do. For refugee students, deficits in basic knowledge and experience can have a profound affect on learning and skill development. In structors in the Refugee Academy should always keep in mind that most of t he refugee students, even those who have experienced forms of education in their native countries, are \"brand new\" at learning in school. \u0083 Know what they are supposed to do wit h a crayon, pencil, scissors, glue, or paintbrush. \u0083 Will be willing to store their ba ckpacks in a locker, out of sight. \u0083 Know that when they get on a bus they will be able to come back home. \u0083 Have seen a picture book. NEVER ASSUME THAT REFUGEE STUDENTS : 7\u0083 Understand that a clean body includes clean clothes. \u0083 Understand that every day the entire body should be clean. \u0083 Desire to \"fit in\" by aba ndoning their traditional culture. \u0083 Are convinced that the t eacher will be nice and helpful , and not hurt or threaten them. \u0083 Are comfortable wearing shoes, underwear, socks, and other unfamiliar clothing. \u0083 Are living in healthy, sanitary conditions , now that they are no longer in their native countries. \u0083 Are smiling and nodding because they understand teachers, not because they have learned that a smile and a nod pleases teachers. \u0083 Have used rest room facilities , let alone public rest rooms with multiple stalls. \u0083 Understand that a gang is not an a ccepted form of an American family. \u0083 Are healthy, just because they appear to be healthy. \u0083 Understand that a fire drill means that they will be safe. \u0083 Are eating lunch every day. \u0083 Have access to breakfast. \u0083 Have had a chance to discover talents that they didn't even know they had. \u0083 Are living with people they know, even if they are relatives. \u0083 Are able to communicate with their parents about school. \u0083 Have parents who believe that it is acceptable to be involved in their child's education. \u0083 Are developmentally at their chronological age. \u0083 Are being treated well by thei r peers and not getting teased. \u0083 Know what it means to be \"on time.\" \u0083 Have difficulty in school because of their backgrounds, when they could have a learning disability or health problem. \u0083 Have experience sitting at a desk all day. 8\u0083 Are used to large crowds of people. \u0083 Are used to adults talking to them individually. \u0083 Can adapt quickly to the routine of changing clothes for gym class. \u0083 Are permitted by their families to participate in all school activities. \u0083 Trust the Academic Coaches, or any ot her adults, especially those in uniform. \u0083 Have ever seen playground equipment or participated in a game or sport. \u0083 Have ever watched a video. \u0083 Have established a morning routine that is not stressful. \u0083 Are allowed to intera ct with the other gender. \u0083 Will automatically connect with peers from their native country. \u0083 Do not harbor ill will against peers from their native country, based on past history of civil wars and violence. \u0083 Interpret nonverbal cues in the same way as their Americ an peers and teachers. \u0083 Have forgotten their past, or \"moved on.\" \u0083 Do not want to talk about their past. \u0083 Want to talk about their past. \u0083 Welcome their new lives, even if it means leaving friends and relatives behind in their native countries. \u0083 Think that they are safe in school. \u0083 Are having difficulties in school solely because of language barriers, when they actually may be overwhelmed and exhaus ted from their new school routines. \u0083 Are participating in school activities bec ause they are comfor table and no longer afraid, when they are actually hiding how they really feel. \u0083 Are so far behind that they will never catch up, when they can actually adjust quickly if they receive reassurance and guidance. AND NEVER ASSUME THAT REFUGEE STUDENTS : Refugee Academy Curriculum MODULE 1 AMERICAN SCHOOLS Module 1 American Schools 1MODULE 1: American Schools PURPOSE The purpose of Module 1 is to inform students about the structure, components, and benefits of American schools.

Academic Coaches and Translators will be available throughout the Refugee Academy and the school year. The first day of the Refugee Academy s hould begin with introducing the Academic Coaches, Translators, and other personnel w ho will provide support to the students in the Refugee Academy. The purpose of the initial introductions is to inform students of the names that the in structors wish to be called, and to reassure the students that the instructors are at the Academ y to personally meet and support the students. These concepts should be reinforc ed throughout the Academy. Do not expect the students to grasp the names and titles of the adults, let alone their responsibilities. The title \"Academic Coach\" is confusing to any student, not just to a student who is new to the American system and unfamiliar with the English language. The Activities in Module 1: American Schools focus on building the comfort level of students with instructor s, the school setting, and peers. Make introductions a relaxed, friendly process. Keep repeating introducti ons throughout the fi rst few days, until students demonstrate that they know the names of the instructors and comprehend the role that the adults will play in their school. 2. Students need opportunities to talk about their personal experiences and goals. Although the primary goal of the Refugee Academy is to familiarize students with the American school system, it is al so important to use the Academy to support students as they move forward in their lives. This does not mean that students s hould be asked to forget about their experiences prior to coming to America. They should not be expected to adjust quickly to their newcomer status and set aside any memories of their native country. Regardless of past circumstances, coming to American schools will be confusing and disarming, perhaps frightening and depres sing. The students will not only be overwhelmed by the school environment, rules, and procedures, but will be worried about making friends and fitting in. Their past ex periences in their native countries, or their images of America, may drive their concerns about what will happen to them in their new schools. The Activities in the Modules are designed so that students will have a chance to reflect on their past experiences, but focus on what is on the horizon. Emphasis should always be on the opportunities available to them in their new schools, and the Key Points - American Schools Module 1 American Schools 4personnel who are there to guide and assist them. As students begin to compare their old schools (or lack of schooli ng) with what they expect to experience in their new schools, the instructors should dispel myth s, provide facts about what to expect, and reassure the students that if they follow the basic rules t hey will have a variety of chances to learn and make new friends. Students should be given the chance to express their ideas about what they would like to gain from their new education. Instruct ors can provide information about how the students can achieve these personal goals. 3. American schools are designed to facilitate assistance and personal growth. At the very beginning of the Refu gee Academy, it is important to explain to the students how the Amer ican school system is broken into three parts: elementary, middle school or junior high, and senior high school, and further divided into grade levels. Some schools combine the grade levels or include grades kindergarten-12 in one building, but the design is similar across the country. Once this concept is shown to students, t hen they can find out where they fit in the spectrum. Are they elementary students? Will they be in grade 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5? They may not know their exact grade level until th e school completes assessments, but it is important that the students in the Academy see the progression of grade levels as it exists in the American school system. ( Note: This will require knowing numbers.) The teachers and other personnel in school s are responsible for moving children through the levels until they graduate from high school. They do this not only by teaching academic knowledge and skills, but by providing students with individual guidance and personal support as students solve problems and make plans for the future. This may be a new concept to the student s in the Refugee Academy. They may not have experienced support from teachers in developing relationships, making decisions about future plans, and solving academic pr oblems. The Academy instructors should keep reinforcing and demonstrating that te achers and other personnel are available to answer questions, intervene if they spot a problem, and work with families to ensure a smooth transition through the levels of education. Students should also become awar e that they have multiple opportunities to learn and grow: on the athletic field, in the classroom , on stage, in the music room, and so forth. They will be expected to achieve basic know ledge and skills in education, required of all students. But they will also have many experiences that will allow them to cultivate talents, try new skills and in terests, and learn about citizenship and service to society. Module 1 American Schools 5 4. American education has multiple benefits. Throughout the Refugee Academy, one of the main themes is that attending American schools can have many benefits. It is, of course, not always a smooth path for students as school districts struggle with growin g student populations, old buildings, staff shortages in crucial subject areas, c hallenging communities and school-family relationships. But for so many refugee students, the schoo ls are a safe haven, a place where the school offerings are a welcome change from their native countries. They welcome the routine, the teacher interest in s ubject matter and stude nts, the numerous extracurricular activities, and the opportunities for a variety of friendships. The students in the Refugee Academy may not realize that American schools have multiple benefits. Their own schools, if they existed, may have had a different focus and may hav e provided limited experiences. The purpose of Module 1 is to expos e students to the school programs that they are about to experience. Later Modules give them a chance to learn more about their options and to make some choices about what they would like to pursue. The ultimate goal of the American educati on system is to prepar e students for their future as adults: pursue education at a pos tsecondary level; develop skills that can be utilized in the workplace; build strong social skills; develop the ability to think analytically to solve problems; and become contributing members of society. The Refugee Academy will assist students in becoming aware of the many opportunities that are ahead of them. As the students par ticipate in the Academy activities, remind them of the ultimate goal of education in America. 5. Schools consist of several standard components, but the elements of a school day may vary. School buildings in America vary considerably in size, location, condition, and security. They di ffer in offerings, expectations, and academic success rates. But the schools in America have many similarities that student s in the Academy should know about. For the instructors of the Academy, the standardization of American schools is obvious. In America, it is common to refer to \"middle school,\" \"recess ,\" \"the principal,\" and terms that are well establ ished in the American school systems across the country. Students in the Academy should be aware of the following similarities across the nation, with specific information pr ovided about their own school system: Module 1 American Schools 6\u0099 Schools are generally located in nei ghborhoods or near a town center. \u0099 Schools start early in the mo rning and end mid-afternoon, with staggered schedules for different age groups. \u0099 Students can walk to school or take free school buses or city buses paid for by the school, or use subway transportation in large cities. \u0099 In addition to classes in the basic subj ects of Mathematics, Science, English Language Arts, and Social Studies, there ar e classes in Physical Education, Art, Music, Health, Career Development, Languages, Technology, and Family/Consumer Science \u0099 Older students may be able to take more advanced or accelerated classes or classes in unique subjects such as Art His tory, Creative Writing, Journalism, and Marching Band. \u0099 Students in grades kindergar ten-5 usually have one teacher during the school day, with additional teachers for \"special\" classes such as Library, Music, or Art. They eat lunch at school and then usua lly go outside or to the gymnasium for \"recess.\" \u0099 Students in grades 6-12 (or 7-12) rotate to classes with many different teachers. \u0099 Schools usually have libraries, gymnasiums, athletic fields and/or playgrounds, and cafeterias. \u0099 Some schools have computer labs, a swimming pool, science laboratories, and weight rooms. \u0099 Schools have standard rules of conduct, with progressive disciplinary procedures, incl uding detention and expulsion. \u0099 Schools may have Study Hall, English as a Second Language, Math or Reading Lab, and other classes to assist students in achieving in academic subjects. \u0099 Guidance counselors are available to assist students in designing their school schedules and creating plans for the future. \u0099 Schools have a principal who is in charge of all of the activities in the school building, who is often assist ed by other administrators. Module 1 American Schools 7 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9- 12 (45 minutes) In this activity: The instructors of the Refugee Academy will introduce themselves to the students, engaging them in informal conversation t hat is short and relaxed. Students will not be expected to interact unle ss they feel comfortable, but they will be encouraged to shake hands (an Amer ican custom) with the instructors. Emphasis should be on learning names. The process of translating should be explained to the students. Vocabulary words can be introduced throughout the exercise. \u0083 One instructor should introduce the adults in the room and shake their hands. o Explain the American custom of shaking hands when greeting someone. Demonstrate the correct way to shake hands, as well as the incorrect ways. o Explain that the instructors will be introducing themselves to each student. \u0083 Shake hands, one at a time, with each studen t. Move around the room in no set order so that students do not become nervous about being next in line. o Ask the students their names and what countries they are from. o Follow up with a general question that is not too personal or potentially embarrassing. Do not ask about the Academy, family situations, or school. Examples of questions are: \u0083 Was it hard to get here this morning? \u0083 Have you been in this building before? ACTIVITY 1: INTRODUCTIONS Module 1 American Schools 8\u0083 Do you know anyone in this class? (Introduce the student to another student.) \u0083 Are you comfortable in this desk? \u0083 Would you rather be sleeping? o Follow student responses with a reassuring comment. The message should be positive. o Questions can be repeated, and the names of the adults should be repeated several times. The adults c an pretend that they have forgotten each other's names and can ask to have them repeated. o Keep refreshing the class about the names of the students. o Point out new vocabulary words as they are used. \u0083 After everyone has been introduced, explain classroom behavior that is required in every school. o Demonstrate each of the cla ssroom behaviors listed below. One instructor can demonstrate poor classroom behavior and the other instructor can demonstrate the expected good behavior. o The purpose of the activity is to inform students how to act in the classroom so that they can be comf ortable and not worry about doing the wrong thing. Emphasis should be on enjoying the Academy and becoming familiar with school procedures, not on obeying the rules. o Practice some of the classr oom behaviors with the class: \u0090 Raise hand to speak; wait to be called on by teacher \u0090 One person speaks at a time \u0090 Respond to teacher questions \u0090 Listen when someone else is talking \u0090 Face the teacher \u0090 Do not move around the room without permission \u0090 Ignore distractions (students talking, joking) \u0090 Keep hands on the desk; keep feet near the desk \u0090 Listen to announcements \u0090 Wait for the bell to ring \u0090 Line up quietly; show courtesy in the hall \u0090 Address the teacher appropriately \u0090 Talk quietly during group activities Module 1 American Schools 9 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9- 12 (45 minutes) In this activity: The students will have the opportunity to express their observations and concerns about American schools. It is part of Module 1 so that any worries or misconceptions can be addressed immediately, before the Academy is underway. This activity will require a class discussion (with students raising hands not only for structuring the discussion but for practice of classroom behavior), and translation time may sl ow the conversation down a bit. However, since the tone of the discussion should be relaxed and informal, the time for translations will allow for attentive listening. \u0083 Invite student responses to the questions , accepting all responses, reminding students about classroom behavio r if they talk all at once. Students do not have to respond if they are uncomfortable, but instructors should try to rephrase ques tions if it appears that the student is unsure or confused. \u0083 Encourage talkers to listen to others; encourage listeners to comment but only if they are willing . Do not comment on how a student may be \"quiet\" or \"shy.\" Go back to the silent students occasionally, to try to draw them into the discussion. o It may take awhile to get any re sponses from anyone in the room. If the students are not reacting, the adults can discuss the questions with each other, looking to the class to agree or disagree with the answers. This pr ocess usually draws in students who cannot resist commenting on what the adults are discussing. o Some students may provide informati on about experiences in their native country that ar e sensitive or graphic. These comments may provide insight into their fee lings about school in America, particularly since they more than li kely left situations that were frightening. Although they do need the opportunity to share their experiences, turn the discussion focus toward fears that students may have about going to school in America. Refute myths and provide information that will put them at ease. ACTIVITY 2: SHARING OBSERVATIONS AND GOALS Module 1 American Schools 10 o Be alert for emotional responses (or unemotional responses) to stories that may be dramatic. Thank the students, reassure them, and repeat the discussion question so that the class can focus on the question at hand. Let children s hare their memories, but do not dwell on negative images, and do not compare the experiences of students. o Emphasis should be on looking towa rd the future and preparing to enter the American school system.

MODULE 2 MAKING FRIENDS Module 2 Making Friends 1MODULE 2: Making Friends PURPOSE The purpose of Module 2 is to assist students in developing new, positive friendships. OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Understand the qualities of a positive friendship \u0083 Develop new friendships in the Refugee Academy \u0083 Understand the process of developing friendships in American schools SUPPLIES Handouts 2-1, 2-2: After-School Activities Beach ball 5 Sets of building blocks or LEGOs\u00ae Pencils Crayons, markers, or colored pencils White poster paper Spiral notebook/ journals Video Refugee Student Interviews Module 2 Making Friends 2MODULE 2: Making Friends VOCABULARY Elementary Vocabulary Secondary Vocabulary Friend/friends Help Kind Ask Club Smile Bully Playground Recess Friend/friends Help Kind Ask Smile Newcomer Bully Culture Sports Club Module 2 Making Friends 3 1. There are many opportunities to develop friendships in American schools. Although students are interested in hearing about their new sc hool and all that it has to offer, they are primarily interested in making new friends. They will undoubtedly be concerned about whether anyone will befriend them. Will they be treated well? Will they be included? How will they make friends if they cannot understand the language, and the environment and activities are so unfamiliar to them? One of the first goals of the Refugee Academy is to reassure students that there are a number of opportunities in American schools to meet new people and form new friendships. In fact, the Academy will be t he place that friends hips will start. Students will need to know that friends hips can form under a variety of circumstances. They may have a partner or team in a school project, and will get to know their fellow cl assmates from sharing ideas and tasks. They may sit near someone who helps them with their studies, or the teacher may assign a partner to show them around the school and introduce them to other students. American schools have so many different activiti es that it is difficu lt to predict when friendships will arise. Friends hips can develop on the playground or athletic field, in after-school activities, during classroom discu ssions, while walking to school, or simply when students have adjacent lockers. Encourage students to keep an open mind about the possibilities of new fr iendships. They should participate in a lot of different activities so that they increase the chances that a friendship will develop. 2. Developing friendships can take a long time. Students in the Refugee Academy should be told many times that the development of friendship can take a long time, especially if t he friendship is to be long-lasting. What is a long time? To primary students it can be a ma tter of two or three days. An invitation to participate in a game on the playground c an constitute an immediate friendship. Working on an art project together with a partner can result in the establishment of a new relationship. But for younger students, if a friendship does not happen in the first few hours, they may get discouraged and withdraw from class participation. Instructors should work to cultivate friendships in the Academy to reassure younger students. For students in intermediate and high school grades, the development of friendships can be stressful, especiall y in the middle school years. Often \"best friends\" have already found each other, groups have been formed, and alliances have been established. Friendships are on and off, often Key Points - Makin g Friends Module 2 Making Friends 4because of miscommunication or changing in terests or temperaments. Students in their preteen and teen years tend to be resistant to anyone who is new (especially if they are considered to be \"different\"). No t all students will be friendly. Not all students will welcome new students into their small group of intimate friends. It may be difficult at first for refugee student s to be included in existing groups, or to connect with someone new. They may feel ignored or rejected, or confused about the reaction of American students to the way that they speak or dress. They may be struggling with how to maintain their culture while adjusting to a new culture. Pressures from family members to follo w cultural traditions may conflict with what is considered stylish in American schools. Students can be confused until they figure out how to balance both worlds. Instructor s should point out t hat this is a typical struggle for students who are new to America, and good fr iends will accept them, no matter how they choose to live their lives. Students in the Refugee Academy should be aware that teasi ng, imitation, and other negative reactions will occur, but most students are interested in welcoming new students. Relationships will form, but it will take patience. Refugee students can find stronger connections if they participate in activities that have mutual interests and goals, and if they keep an open mind about friendship possibilities. 3. Be a good friend to build friendships. Refugee students will undoubtedly be missing their friends and relatives from their native countries, and may feel certain t hat they will never be able to form new friendships in American schools. While they are trying to cope with the loss of people who were important to t hem, they will be worried about how they can create new relationships. Refugee students will often be scared and worried as they try to navigate through an unfamiliar school day. They may appear aloof when they are actually shy, or unwilling to participate when they are just confused about what is expe cted of them. Instructors should explain to students that they can r each out with a smile and a greeting to demonstrate an interest in forming a fri endship. If they consistently demonstrate kindness, cooperation, and willingness to enjoy their new school activities, they will be demonstrating the qualities of a good friend. It may be difficult at times, but if they try to maintain a positive attitude, they will undoubtedly experienc e positive reactions. They should also be looking for the same positiv e qualities when forming new friendships, so that the new relationships ar e ones of mutual respect. For some Refugee Academy classes, it ma y be necessary to raise the issue of conflicts between cultural groups. Some student s may have resentment, fear, or anger against other students in the classroom because of past history in their native country. Without dwelling on this sensitive subject, keep stressing that enrolling in a new school in America means the possibility of setting old conflicts aside and developing tolerance and new relationships. Students may be resist ant because of memories, pressures Module 2 Making Friends 5from family members, or f ears about repercussions. The instructors can gently suggest that students now have the chance to move on to new types of friendships. 4. Some \"friendships\" may not be healthy for newcomers. As the Refugee Academy instructors talk to the students about fr iendship, it is important to discuss the qualit ies of a good friend. New stud ents may not realize that a fellow student who is paying attention to them is actually mocking them or deliberately making them feel uncomfortable. For refugee students the attention alone may constitute \"friendship,\" when it is a relati onship that is not healthy for newcomers. Encourage students in the Academy to be fr iendly and responsive to people who are kind and helpful, but to take their time before forming new alliances. They should observe the dynamics of the classes and after-school activities to see who treats peers with respect. Who stands out in the class for their charac ter and kindness, not for their negative leadership or poor treatment of others? New students should become acquainted with as many people as possible, without limiting friendships to those who take the initiative, because the initiator may not have the best intentions. Refugee students will be vulnerable because of their limited English and unfamiliarity with their new school . There are, unfortunately, classmates who seek out those who are vulnerable and will mock the clothing, hygiene, eating habits, speaking skills, and other characterist ics of refugee students. Some classmates will make it perfectly clear that the refugee students are not welcome in America. Some refugee students may be so desperate fo r friends that they will connect with anyone who pays attention to them. This can lead to the development of relationships with peers who are negative influences, sometimes with the refugee student not even realizing that they are partici pating in activities that are against school policies, or are dangerous or illegal. Inform students in the Academy that good friends do not encourage participation in teas ing, bullying, truancy, drug and alcohol abuse, gangs, and other negative activities. (Modules 4 School Rules and 12 School Safety address this topic in more detail.) It is important to warn students that they might encounter individuals who will be unpleasant and unfair. Although the things that those individuals say and do are hurtful, those individuals do not speak fo r everyone in the school. Inform the students of the Refugee Academy how to avoid re sponding to negative attacks, and where to get assistance if treatment by fellow classmates interferes with comfort or safety. Module 2 Making Friends 6 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: Students will begin discussing the importance of forming friendships that are positive. T he exercise will facilitate the development of friendships amon g students of the Refugee Academy. Before introducing the Beach Ball Exercise , discuss the following questions with the students. After student responses , share the concepts listed under each question, emphasizing the Key Points. The topic is a sensitive one, but impor tant to address early in the Refugee Academy because it is of utmost impor tance to the student s. Emphasize that most peers will welcome newcomers, and that those classmates who are unwelcoming should be ignored. Encour age students to discuss friendship problems with the Academic Coach. Discussion Questions How do you know if someone is a friend? \u0083 Discuss the qualities of a positive friendship. \u0083 Explain how the depth of friendships varies (acquaintance vs. friendship). \u0083 Role-play overcoming shyness and develop ing friendships (instructors play the roles). Where have you met new friends in y our native country and in America? \u0083 Friends can be made anywhere, incl uding the playground, neighborhood, family, at jobs. ACTIVITY #1: QUALITIES OF FRIENDSHIP Module 2 Making Friends 7\u0083 Address that it was probably difficult to make friends if families were moving and living with conflict and fear, but students will be able to make new friends in their new school. \u0083 Students may not have any friends for a variety of reasons, and are worried about making friends in America. Stre ss that one of the purposes of the Refugee Academy is to meet new friends. Can you tell what someone is like just by looking at them? \u0083 Explain the phrase \"do not judge a book by its cover.\" \u0083 Discuss how peers will judge and friendships will take time. Provide ideas about how to cope with embarrassment, rejection, and poor treatment. \u0083 Stress that actions, especially ki ndness and friendliness, can outweigh appearance and shyness. \u0083 Raise the issue of the difficulty of main taining native culture and still \"fitting in.\" Discuss how to balance different cultures and lifestyles. \u0083 If relevant, point out that past conflic ts between groups in native countries can interfere with the development of friendships in American schools. Encourage students to set old stereotypes aside without providing specifics of the history between groups. \u0083 Encourage students to take the initiative to form friendships, but only after observing and determining who wil l treat them with respect. \u0083 Encourage support of fellow newcomers. Beach ball exercise : Ask the students to st and in a circle. Arrange the circle so that students are co mfortable standing near each other. Keep cultural customs in mind as you establish the location of each student. Tell them that you are going to play a game that will help them get to know each other better. \u0083 Explain to the students that you are going to say your name and the country you are from, and then toss the beach ball to someone else in the circle. \u0083 When the ball is caught, the recipient is to say their name, the country they are from, and the name of the person who threw them the ball. \u0083 Continue tossing the ball, recognizing that the list of names will get longer and more confusing. Do not pressure students to remember the names. Ask everyone in the group to assist when names are forgotten. Ask students to repeat their names many times. Module 2 Making Friends 8\u0083 Reassure students that this is not a game of skill, but fo r fun. All of the instructors should partici pate, deliberately missing the ball, bouncing it on their knee, etc. to help the students enjoy the game. \u0083 As the students start to learn the names of their Academy classmates, they will become more relaxed and comf ortable, paving the way for the development of friendships. As an added activity , point out the countries of the students on a world map or globe. Keep in mi nd that some students will have stereotypes of other countries (or of students from their own country with differing religions or cultural ba ckgrounds). Stress the qualities of good friends. Point out that new comers will not want to be judged when they enter their new classrooms, so the students in the Refugee Academy should refrain from judging their peers. Module 2 Making Friends 9 Grades K-5 (30 minutes) In this activity: The purpose of the Building Exercise is to show how small groups of students can work toget her on a project that requires minimal facility with the English language. Divide students into groups of 3 or 4, mixing gender and nat ive countries, but maintaining the same general age ranges. Provide each group with a set of build ing blocks or LEGOs\u00ae and a picture of what they are supposed to build. (Instr uctors may determine that the exercise would be more effective if the student s can build any structure, without a picture as a guide.) \u0083 Explain that each small group is to work together to build , even if they speak different languages. (ESL inst ructors may encourage the students to use English words if they have acqui red relevant vocabulary words.) o They are to: \u0083 Make sure everyone has a chance to participate. \u0083 Work together, not separately. \u0083 Use a variety of ways to communicate including speaking English as much as possible (nonverbal cues, drawings, demonstrations). \u0083 Use the interpreter only if they are unable to move forward with the task. \u0083 Make their own structure if they are unable to follow the directions on the picture. \u0083 Demonstrate the qualities of a good friend. o Circulate amongst the groups, encouraging the involvement of students who are holding back or letting others dom inate the group. Intervene when the group appears to be dysfunctional or unable to accomplish the task. ACTIVITY #2: FACILITATING ACADEMY FRIENDSHIPS Module 2 Making Friends 10 o Compliment the students on their ability to work together even though they do not know each other. Remind them that by working on a project together they have developed a connection that can lead to a friendship. Grades 6-8, 9-12 (30 minutes) In this activity: The purpose of the Drawing Exercise is to show how small groups of students can work toget her on a project that requires minimal facility with the English language. Divide students into groups of 3 or 4, mixing genders and nat ive countries, but maintaining the same general age ranges. Provide each group with crayons, colored pencils, or markers, and large sheets of poster paper. \u0083 Explain that the small group is to work together to draw their favorite foods on one sheet of paper , even if they speak different languages. (ESL instructors may encourage the students to use English words if they have acquired relevant vocabulary words.) o They are to: \u0083 Make sure everyone has a chance to participate. \u0083 Work together, not separately; help each other draw and color. \u0083 Use a variety of ways to communicate, including speaking English as much as possible (nonverbal cues, drawings, demonstrations). \u0083 Use the interpreter only if they are unable to move forward with the task. \u0083 Demonstrate the qualities of a good friend. \u0083 Circulate amongst the groups, encouraging the involvement of students who are holding back or letting others dominate the group. Intervene when the group appears to be dysfunctional or unable to accomplish the task. Module 2 Making Friends 11Students may have difficulty drawing, and they may have to explain the ingredients of what they are drawing. \u0083 Remind the students that by working on a project together they have developed a connection that can lead to a friendship . They may not recognize the different foods, but they all share in their interest in food and the way they feel when t hey eat a meal that they enjoy. (Demonstrate reactions to a good meal.) Discussion Questions How did you do this activity, even though you speak different languages? How did you show that you could be a helping friend? How did others show that they could be helpful? What new words did you l earn, in any language? If appropriate, discuss American \"fast f oods\" and how newcomers can develop a taste for them, not realizing the fat content and expense. Module 2 Making Friends 12 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (30 minutes) Show the video Refugee Student Interviews . \u0083 Use the Guide to the Videos for introducing the video and for follow- up discussion. \u0083 Discuss sharing contact information with peers: o Gaining permission to exchange phone numbers o Privacy (not sharing personal information) o Communication systems such as e-mail and cell phones ACTIVITY #3: VIDEO Module 2 Making Friends 13 Grades K-5 (15 minutes) During the Refugee Academy the students will have the opportunity to write or draw in daily journals. They will be a ssigned topics, but can write ab out any subject or draw a picture of anything that relates to adjusting to American schools. Distribute the journals (spiral notebooks, pencils, and crayons) and discuss: \u0083 The purpose of the journal s is for the students to record things that they want to remember, topics that interest them, and reactions to what they have learned in the Academy. The journals are private and will not be shared with the class. (Ins tructors will have to determine in advance if students will be expected to bring in the journals daily and show their entries to the instructors. This proc ess may be necessary to determine if the students are completing the task, and to identify students who need additional support or counseling.) \u0083 Students may write in their own language or draw pictures of their thoughts. Discuss how a journal is for expression of personal feelings. For many students this will be a novel concept and it may ta ke them awhile to feel comfortable talking about how they feel. \u0083 For the first journal entry, ask students: o Grades K-3: Draw a pi cture of a good friend o Grades 4-5: How can I make new friends? Grades 6-8, 9-12 (15 minutes) During the Refugee Academy the students will have the opportunity to write or draw in daily journals. They will be a ssigned topics, but can write about or draw a picture of any subject. Distribute the journals (spiral notebooks, pencils, and crayons) and discuss: \u0083 The purpose of the journals is for the students to record things that they want to remember, topics that inte rest them, and reactions to what they have learned in the Academy. The jour nals are private and will not be shared ACTIVITY #4: JOURNALS Module 2 Making Friends 14with the class. (Instructors will have to determine in advance if students will be expected to bring in the journals daily and show their entries to the instructors. This process may be necessary to dete rmine if the students are completing the task. Middle school and high school students may be particularly sensitive about the contents of their journals. They may insist on privacy, especially if they are concerned that their journal s will be shared with their parents. Instructors may establish privacy policies, but should understand that there may be occasions when the contents of the journals may be a signal that st udents need additional support or counseling. \u0083 Students may write in their own language or draw pictures of their thoughts. Discuss how a journal is for expression of personal feelings. For many students this will be a novel concept and it may ta ke them awhile to feel comfortable talking about how they feel. \u0083 For the first journal entry, ask students to: o Write or draw pictures about making friends in America. Module 2 Making Friends 15 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (10 minutes) After-School Activities (6-12) \u0083 Discuss opportunities for meeting new friends. \u0083 Discuss the clubs and other after-school ac tivities represented by the pictures. \u0083 Add information about local activities. \u0083 Discuss local community programs such as the Boys/Girls Club or the YMCA. \u0083 Explain that school activities are free, but most community activities will charge a fee. Fees are often based on need, and when students sign up, a fee will be determined for them. T he School Nurse and Academic Coaches can also arrange for coverage of fees. Students shoul d not eliminate an activity because they cannot afford to pay for the f ee or equipment. They should talk to Academic Coaches if there is an inte rest in an after-school activity. \u0083 Provide flyers and brochures about specific programs. Ask interpreters to translate the information. \u0083 Repeat the information throughout t he Academy because the students may have difficulty absorbing all of t he information early in the Academy. ACTIVITY #5: AFTER -SCHOOL ACTIVITIES Module 2 Making Friends 16 JOURNAL TOPIC \u0083 (Discussed in Activity #4) SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES \u0083 Invite students from the school district to visit for snacks, introductions, and the beach ball game. \u0083 Establish students as mentors for refugee students and invite them to discuss the mentoring process. \u0083 Invite speakers from school clubs and local community organizations to greet the st udents and describe activities; bring uniforms, games, projects ; demonstrate what they have learned in after-school activities (karate, baseball, art, theater, etc.). \u0083 Using the children's books included in the Welcome to Our Schools Kit , discuss what the main characters might write or draw in their journals. \u0083 Rather than sending the st udents outside for disorganized free time, organize games and activities that facilitate the development of new friendships. If some students will be in the same class or grade, arrange for time for them to connect with one another. MODULE 3 TRANSPORTATION AND TIME Module 3 Transportation and Time 1MODULE 3: Transportation and Time PURPOSE The purpose of Module 3 is to familiarize students with the scheduling of a school day. OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Understand the structure and schedule of a school day \u0083 Understand the importance of planning and organizing to be prepared for the school day \u0083 Become comfortable with school transportation SUPPLIES Handout 3-1: Getting to School Handout 3-2: School Subjects Photos, drawings of school transportation School maps (modified) 5 full backpacks (see Activity #1) Items for role - playing (see Activity #3) student desk, alarm clock, school bell, jump rope, locker or cubby, textbooks, pencil and paper, calculator, etc. Videos: Refugee Student Interviews and A Day in School (Elementary, Middle or High School) Module 3 Transportation and Time 2MODULE 3: Transportation and Time VOCABULARY Elementary Vocabulary Secondary Vocabulary Time Bus Walk Driver Car/automobile School Bus Late Supplies Bus Stop Clap Homework Time Organization Plan/schedule Bus Walk Driver Car/automobile Transportation Late Notebook Planner Alarm Clock Supplies Bus Stop Homework Clap Module 3 Transportation and Time 3 1. Transportation to school is free and scheduled. Depending on how the students are transported to the Refugee Academy, they may not realize that transportation to and fr om school is arranged by the school district at no cost to the student. Students can walk to school , usually if they live within a specified distance from their school building, or they can take a school bus , city bus , subway , or a combination of those forms of transportation. It will be necessary to review every aspect of using school transportation. Even if the students are experienced in bus transportation, do not assume that they know about bus safety (including getting on and off the bus), the role of the bus driver, how to handle problems on the bus, and the importance of punctuality. In structors should determine the mode of transportation for ev ery student and provide detailed information about bus routes, numbers, schedules, and the names of bus drivers. For st udents taking the train/subway, review safety procedures and strategies for alternative routes. Students will also need to know what to do if they miss the bus. Discuss possible backup plans that should be established before they start school. They may also sign up for after-school activities that will require them to take a \"late bus.\" They need to inform family members of changes in their transportation schedule. Some schools will require special passes and permission slips for ri ding buses after school hours, especially for school-related field trips. 2. Punctuality is expected and school schedules must be followed. Students may not be accustomed to schools that run on a strict time schedule. Instructors should poin t out that students are expected to be in school on time. They are to be ready for school and waiting for transportation in the morning. They should get to their first class or hom eroom in time for attendance, and make it to their classes on time. During Module 3, the instru ctors should review the schedules for the schools, explaining details such as where students should go when they arrive at school, what the bells signify, and how much time they have if they have to change classes. For many students, all of this activity while watching the clock will be confusing, perhaps even alarming. It can be disarming to be in a hallway full of high school students when classes are changing in a large school. It ca n be frightening to students who associate bells with alarms and air raids. Even in t he elementary grades when students line up to Key Points - Trans portation and Time Module 3 Transportation and Time 4move to another activity , many refugee students may not understand the process and may be bewildered about where everyone is going. Instructors should take the time to explain about how large numbers of students are able to get to all of their classes, as long as everyone follows the procedures and schedule. 3. Establishing routines requi res practice and experience. Students need to be reassured that they will soon adapt to the schedules of the schools, but it ta kes planning and practice. If they pack their backpacks the night before school, they will not waste time searching for schoolbooks in the mo rning. If they plan out their mornings, they will be able to get to their bus stop on time. If they become familiar with the layout of t he school building, they will be able to get to their classes on time. Observing and practicing will be t he keys to establishing routi nes that feel comfortable. Any chances the instructors can give t he students to observe and practice will be essential during the Refugee Academy 4. Time management begins with planning. One of the purposes of Module 3 is to assist students in getting organized so that they can successfully navigate the school system in the fall. The instructors can t each the students tricks for time management and planning. Describe basic organizational strategies that may seem obvious, but can make life in an American school more efficient. For example, teachers can demonstrate alarm clocks, assignment notebooks, folders for different subjects, pencil boxes, and calendars, to give students ideas about how they can organize their lives. Explain to students that they will need to provide some of their own basic school supplies, and should always come to class prepared with notebooks or paper, pencils, and the assigned text book. They can be better prepared if they keep their backpacks and lockers neat and organized. Suggest that they routinely sort through papers and file them in file folders or pockets of notebooks, clear out lockers of loose papers (and old lunches!) and establish an organization system in their backpacks so that they always know where everything is located. Students are better able to respond to suggestions about organization if they have the chance to experiment with strategies and ca n settle on a system that works best for them personally. The activities in Module 3 will give them opportunities to think about how they would like to organize thei r time and their materials for school. Module 3 Transportation and Time 5 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: The purpose of the Backpack Exercise is to demonstrate the contents of a backpack, and methods of organizing a backpack or book bag. Explain to the students what each item is, and how it ended up in the backpack. Students should understand what belongs in a backpack (and what does not belong in a backpack) and how keepi ng a backpack organized can help in adapting to the Amer ican school system. \u0083 Unload a full backpack, one item at a time. The backpack should contain: 9 Supplies, textbooks, library books 9 School lunch 9 Bus pass/lunch ticket 9 School report 9 Spiral notebooks, folders 9 Assignment notebook 9 Amusing items (extra sock, one glove, etc.) 9 Writing supplies \u0083 Point out unacceptable items such as toys, gum, large amounts of money, over-the-counter medicines. (Do not address school safety at this ti me other than to point out that school rules forbid dangerous items, toys, medi cines that are supposed to be in the nurse's office, and candy or gum in school. See Module 12: School Safety.) \u0083 As items are being remo ved from the backpack, point out the following information : o Pack the backpack the night before school. o The backpack will contain the same items every day, such as lunch, writing supplies, or notebooks. Ma ke sure the items are handy. ACTIVITY #1: READY FOR SCHOOL Module 3 Transportation and Time 6 o Class assignments may require addition al items such as library books, textbooks, homework, artwor k, or school projects. o The student may have additional items to carry such as clothes for physical education (\"gym clothes\"), a musical instrument, or a school project. o Explain how some items must be purchased and some will be provided by the school. Provide ideas about where students can purchase supplies. o Backpacks can be heavy. Some refugee students do not like to store anything that they own, so they tend to carry everything related to school in their backpacks. Reassure students that, although they can keep their backpacks with them, they can keep most school materials at home or in their locke r when they are not needed in class. Some schools do not allow students to carry backpacks around the school building, so students will have to plan when they can make a stop at their locker between classes. Remind students to keep their backpacks in sight when they do have the backpacks with them. o Some schools may conduct random searches of backpacks. Inform students to cooperate. If the students have followed school rules, they should not worry. If they are detained by the school administration or police officers, they should request a translator and their Academic Coach. o Younger students will have a storage area in their elementary classroom, often referred to as a \"cubby\". The teachers will tell them what should be stored in the cubby and what should be stored in their desk. \u0083 Divide the students into small groups of 3 or 4, and give them a full backpack . Ask the students to: o Identify each item in the backpack. o Refill the backpack in an organized manner. o Identify items that could be stored in a locker or cubby. o Students should make a list or draw pictures of items needed for a backpack, to share with family members.

MODULE 4 SCHOOL RULES Module 4 School Rules 1 MODULE 4: School Rules PURPOSE The purpose of Module 4 is to familiarize students with classroom procedures. OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Understand school rules \u0083 Understand classroom activities and procedures \u0083 Understand the role of teachers and other personnel in schools SUPPLIES Handout 4 - 1: School Rules Six puzzles Supplies for children's book activity Classroom Jobs chart from an elementary classroom Tables/desks together for completing puzzles Boxes of classroom instructional resources (5 elementary boxes, 5 secondary boxes), including textbooks, maps, globes, mathematics manipulatives, and other classroom resources for all subjects Video: Refugee Student Interviews Module 4 School Rules 2MODULE 4: School Rules VOCABULARY Elementary Vocabulary Secondary Vocabulary Skills Learn Ask Ask Questions Listen Pair Group Raise Hand Quiet Team Classroom Rules Help Teacher Knowledge Skill Interest Listen Ask Ask Questions Learn Plan Textbook/books Puzzle Puzzle Piece Raise hand Quiet Team Classroom Rules Attendance Help Teacher Principal Pair Obey Detention Discipline Group Module 4 School Rules 3 1. Students can build knowledge, skills, and interests in school. Although some of the students in the Refugee Academy will have attended school in their native countries, they may not have experienced schools that not only build knowledge and skills, but cultivate interests as well. Most American schools, regar dless of the level of re sources, value learning experiences for students that capture thei r interest and inspire their curiosity and motivation. Teachers in general try to encourage students to pursue their interests and to express their ideas and opinions. For many students in the Academy, it will be the first time they will be able to openly discuss their point of view. T hey will be exposed to a variety of perspectives, and allowed to share their own ideas on many topics discussed in class. At first this may seem risky to the students, but eventually they should be able to understand that the learning process involves questioning, raising concerns, and analyzing issues from many different angles. New refugee students may hes itate when they are asked, \"What do you think?\" or \"Do you agree?\" They may be afraid to speak up. They may not feel comfortable sharing their point of view, espec ially if they fear that it contradicts the teacher, the other students, or their family me mbers. Explain that teachers understand that new ideas may conf lict with cultural traditions and understandings, and the purpose of education is not to undermine the cultural heritage of students. Encourage students to listen to discussions, weigh information, check facts, and share what they are thinking. Enc ourage them to explore new ideas and activities, developing creativity and new interests, without demeaning or rejecting their traditional cultural perspectives. 2. By following basic classroom rules of behavior, students have a better chance to learn. In Module 4 students learn about the basic rules in school that are designed to facilitate learning. The expected classroom behaviors that every American student recogni zes will not necessarily be so obvious to refugee students. Key Points - School Rules Module 4 School Rules 4 Rules such as sitting at a desk and faci ng the front of the room, raising a hand to be called upon by the teacher, and lining up with the class to move to another classroom may all be unfam iliar for new students. The Refugee Academy provides a chance for the students to learn and practice basic classroom behaviors, to better facilitate learning. 3. Some school activities are d esigned for student interaction. Although students in American schools sit in desks for most of the day, there are occasions when they have the opportunity to pull their desks together or sit around a table to meet in groups to work on class projects. Students are often asked to work in teams in physical education, art, and theater classes, and to work in partners in classrooms to correct assignments and solve problems. For those new students who have not ex perienced school, or for those who have attended schools with more rigorous approaches to instruction, the informality of group work may be confusing. The students will need to learn how to participate in a group, especially when every student seems to be talking at the same time. They will need information about how to be assertive and cooperative, and how to lead with confidence and contribute skills and ideas. They will also need to know what the par ameters of group work are, such as monitoring the noise level, focusing on the task, and treating group members with respect. School activities that are designed for student interaction give new students a chance to show what they know and to make new friends. Module 4 allows them to build the skills that will enable them to participate in groups effectively. 4. Teachers enforce the rules and provide assistance. Once basic school rules are reviewed in the Refugee Academy, it is necessary to inform students about how the rules are enforced. Explain how teachers take attendance, check for hall passes, warn students about classroom behav iors that are unacceptable, and refer students to the principal or vice/assistant principal (or send them \"to the office \") if they are not follo wing classroom rules. Students should know about t he progressive discipline policies in their school district, including the impact of detention, suspension, and expulsion on their academic record and their future. Module 4 School Rules 5As disciplinary methods are being de scribed, include information about student rights. Stress that they ma y ask for assistance from the Academic Coach or the translator if they are having difficulty with a teacher (or fello w student), or are sent to the principal's office for discipline. Most important, emphasize respect fo r classroom teachers. New students may not understand that one student or a class of students disrespecting a teacher is not acceptable behavior in school. Expl ain to them how they can request assistance if they feel that they are unwillingly becoming involved in classroom behavior that is disruptive and interf ering with their ability to learn. Module 4 School Rules 6 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: Students will learn about school rules and will have the chance to practice them. The younger students may need mo re time to practice basic classroom behavior such as raising their hands to speak, lining up to walk through the halls, and quietly working in pairs on classroom assignments. Older students (grades 3-12) will need in formation about how to ignore distractions in the room, especially if they are tempted to be part of a group that is not paying attention. All students will need reassurance that there are occasions when teachers will allow conversations and social in teractions if the students are still concentrating on their work and cooperat ing with each other. The teachers will inform the students about expected behavior. \u0083 Distribute Handout 4-1: School Rules and discuss the illustrations, asking students to practice the school rules. o Keep some textbooks and supplies in a locker and determine when would be the bes t time to stop at the locker. Keep it locked and do not allow other students to have access to the locker. o In elementary classrooms, school supplies and backpacks will be kept in the classroom. Clothes for physical education may be locked in a locker room. When the class moves to another classroom, all students line up quiet ly and leave their supplies in their classroom. o Enter the classroom and go straight to an assigned seat. Face the teacher and listen. If other st udents are not paying attention and are talking, continue to face the teacher, put hands on the desk, and focus on the teacher. ACTIVITY #1: SCHOOL RULES Module 4 School Rules 7 o Raise a hand to be called upon or to add to the conversation. Raise a hand to ask permission to leave the seat or the r oom. Do not wave hands or shout out. o Students are obviously allowed to talk when working in pairs, but sometimes the noise level in the classroom can get too loud. Demonstrate signals for class quiet: \u0083 Finger on lips \u0083 Teacher hand in air \u0083 Teacher standing quietly \u0083 Classroom lights on and off \" quiet\", \"shhhhh\", \"attention, please\" Students are also expected to be quiet during announcements on the public address system and during fire drills and evacuation/lockdown drills. (See Module 12 ) o When working independently on a test, students should refrain from talking to other classmates . If they have any questions, they should raise a hand or approach the teacher's desk. o The students will probably begin the day with the Pledge of Allegiance. The instructors can inform the students about this routine and the appropriate behavior during the pledge. o In group activities such as those shown on the handout, students may be allowed to quietly socialize, but are expected to focus on the task at hand. Teachers will have different rules about what is allowed, depending upon the style of the t eacher and the type of activity. Discussion Questions What should you do if students next to you are talking when the teacher wants quiet? \u0083 Face forward. \u0083 Do not interact or get involved. Module 4 School Rules 8What if the other students near you are having fun and you want to join them? \u0083 Remind students that the purpose of school is to learn. \u0083 Some classes will allow social interaction. \u0083 Assess the situation to determine if so cial interaction is acceptable to the teacher. When should you be quiet in school unless you have a question? \u0083 Walking in the halls (elementary) \u0083 Class study time \u0083 Library \u0083 Study Hall \u0083 Assemblies When can you talk and laugh, but not too loudly? \u0083 Bus \u0083 Hall (secondary level) \u0083 Physical Education \u0083 Group projects How do you ask a teacher for help? \u0083 ESL program/Academic Coach \u0083 Raise hand \u0083 Parent calls \u0083 Study Hall \u0083 Guidance counselor Module 4 School Rules 9\u0083 E-mail, if appropriate \u0083 Approach the teacher's de sk, if it is allowed. \u0083 If quiet is required, ask a teacher, not a student. What if you don't want anyone to know you need help? \u0083 Discuss the importance of seeking out an adult to ask for help. Provide options, including the Academic Coach. \u0083 Suggest discreet ways of asking for assistance. How can the Academic Coach help? \u0083 Describe the role and availabi lity of the Academic Coach. Module 4 School Rules 10 In this activity: Elementary students will learn abo ut the responsibility of taking care of their classroom. Secondary level students will have the opportunity to practice working on a task in groups. For all ages, emphasize how it is important to share tasks in the classroom and in learning activities. Students can demonstrate their willingness to help out and share, even if they cannot speak English. Grades K-5 (45 minutes) \u0083 Show a typical classroom jobs chart from a local elementary classroom. \u0083 With the class, identify and assign classroom jobs for the Academy, such as: o Watering plants o Feeding fish/animals o Collecting papers o Distributing handouts o Leading the line. \u0083 Use the model chart or create a chart on the chalkboard. \u0083 Switch jobs two or three times to give students a chance to experience the responsibility of different jobs. ACTIVITY #2: WORKING IN GROUPS Module 4 School Rules 11 Grades 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) \u0083 Divide the class into groups of 3 or 4 and discuss basic rules about working in groups: o Take turns. o Include all group members. o Help and share. o Discuss how it is important to ask for clarifications. o Demonstrate how asking for help can be done in English or nonverbally. \u0083 Give each group a puzzle to complete as a group . o Discuss how to work together to put the puzzle together. o Show how puzzles are put together for those students unfamiliar with the process. (Some students will never have seen a puzzle before.) o After completion of the first puzzl e, rotate student s so that they work with new students on a new puzzle. Discussion Questions How did you work together to put the puzzle together? \u0083 Discuss how the students shared. \u0083 Point out different skills t hat were used by the students. \u0083 Comment on how students can learn from new experiences, and that some activities are easier when peers provide assistance. Module 4 School Rules 12Was it hard to do? \u0083 There will be varying reactions to this question. Point out that some people love to do puzzles, while others find them frustrating. Puzzles take practice and skills can improve. They can be challenging, but fun to do. \u0083 Without pointing out specific st udents, discuss how some personalities can dominate a group. Discuss how respectful leadership can be a positive influence in a group, but in terrupting and trying to control the group can slow the activity down and cause friction and discomfort. Discuss the qualities of a positive group member. Was it fun working in a group? \u0083 Point out the noise level of enjoyment \u0083 Discuss how groups can be difficult at times because of different personalities and skill levels. \u0083 Some students who were not able to participate effectively because they were not fluent in English might have been frustrated. Reassure students that it will take time to be able to be a full participant in groups, but they should always make an effort to contribute to group activities. \u0083 Instructors should identi fy strategies that students employed to help out the group, even if they could not speak English. What are some puzzles or problems a bout going to school that you would like to solve with the help of a group? \u0083 Provide suggestions that the class can discuss in groups, such as where to buy school supplies, what to bring to school on the first day of class, and how to make new friends. Module 4 School Rules 13 In this activity: Refugee students will have t he opportunity to find out what instructional res ources are readily available in classrooms. They may not realize that the schools will provide textbooks and other free materials that can be used in the classroom or can be borrowed for homework and research. To help students become familiar with the resources, they will be shown each item in a box of instructional ma terials, and then will be asked to look through the resources to find specific information. Emphasize that the materials need to be signed out, returned on time, and treated carefully since they are the pr operty of the school. They may be distributed at the beginning of a class, and then collected at the end of the class. Grades K-5 (45 minutes) Can You Find? \u0083 Divide students into groups of 4 or 5. Provide each group with a large box of instructional resources, in cluding textbooks, library books, math cubes and manipulatives, workbooks, small globe, flash cards, etc. o Ask students to look through the box to see what types of resources they will find in their classrooms. Ask the groups to work together as a team to locate t he following items, one at a time: ACTIVITY #3: CLASSROOM RESOURCES A page of math problems Workbook for writing A map of the world Story to read Math tools (specify) Picture of a science experiment (Add easy-to-locate items, depending upon resources.)

Module 5 So Much to Learn! 1MODULE 5: So Much to Learn! PURPOSE The purpose of Module 5 is to inform students about the range of learning opportunities in American schools. OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Recognize that the purpose of school is to learn, regardless of the setting or activity \u0083 Become familiar with common American knowledge and traditions in American schools \u0083 Understand the valuable contributions of refugee students to American schools SUPPLIES Handout 5 - 1: School Calendar Current world map Globe United States map Tossed salad Welcome to Our Schools poster for each student Videos: Refugee Student Interviews and A Day in School (Elementary, Middle or High School) School calendar (See Activity #3) Module 5 So Much to Learn! 2MODULE 5: So Much to Learn VOCABULARY Elementary Vocabulary Secondary Vocabulary Country Map Globe Tossed Salad Welcome Holiday Vacation Learn Calendar Country Map Globe Tossed Salad Welcome Contribution Vacation Learn Calendar Melting Pot Tolerance Holiday Module 5 So Much to Learn! 3 1. Regardless of the activity, th e purpose of school is to learn. Students who are new to America may be so enamored with all of the entertaining activities of American schools that they may not realize that for ever y activity there are many educational objectives. The purpose of Module 5 is to remind students that, although there are many interesting activi ties offered by American schools, the underlying intention of all of them is for students to be able to learn. Teachers emphasize \"content\" and \"process\" in all subject areas, encouraging students to build knowledge and skills, while learning how to solve problems, tackle issues critically, make sound and rational decisions, build social skills, and express opinions with confidence. For example, activities on the athletic field not only teach students about the rules of a sport, but they hel p students understand how teamwork and communication work and how it is import ant to practice and develop skills. In a lab, it may be fun to carry ou t science experiments with a partner, but students are also learning scientifi c principles and concepts, lab techniques, problem-solving, and other skills such as graphing, charting, and statistics. New students who have never ex perienced any of these acti vities may see them only as an opportunity to socialize and enjoy the school day. However, if this enthusiasm is coupled with an understanding of the purpose of school, the result can be better success in the American education system. Of course, not every subjec t will be stimulating for all students, and refugee students will soon discover that there are activities t hat are routine and repet itive, and teachers who are unimaginative and boring. It is important to explain to new students that they will find activities that ar e fun and exciting, and activities that are tedious or demanding. For all of those activities, howev er, students are expected to work hard to learn something new. It may be necessary to encourage students to expand their horizons and try new subjects and activities. They may be afraid to participate in class or join a club because they are uncomfortable with their classmates, or afraid because they have never experienced the activi ty before. Once students grasp the concept that everything they do in school is a learning experience, they may be more willing to seek many different ways of gaining knowledge. Key Points - So Much to Learn! Module 5 So Much to Learn! 4 2. Knowledge and traditions can be common to all Americans. There are commonalities that connect Amer ican school systems. Basic curriculum and school traditions are generally the same ac ross the country. Every school in the country includes English Language Arts or Reading, Science, Social Studies, and Mathematics in their curriculum. In general , the schools across the nation hold student assemblies, science fairs, band concerts, and pep rallies. One tradition that is consistent across t he country is the school calendar. Across the nation there are students who have summer va cations, national holidays, conference days, and winter breaks, when school is not in session. The dates may vary slightly, but the patterns are the same. Students in the Refugee Academy should not only be aware of the traditional school calendar, but should understand why there will be days when school may be canceled. Suppose, for example, that they are not aware that in some districts they do not go to school on \"snow days\" \"Yom Kippur\" or \"G ood Friday.\" Student s and their families need to be forewarned. In Module 5 the instructors can go through the school district calendar with the st udents, explaining national holidays such as Thanksgiving, Memorial Day, and Martin Luther King Jr. Day. They can explain why some days are \"half-days\" so that teachers can attend training sessions, and parents can m eet with teachers. Students may be confused about long winter breaks or religious holi days. Instructors can discuss the holidays authorized by the school district, and how families might celebrate during those holidays. They can discuss how students can spend their school vacations during the year, and in the summer. In the elementary grades the students may have the opportunity to learn more about national holidays as part of the academic curriculum. However, at the secondary level it is often assumed that students know why school is cancelled for holidays such as \"Presidents' Day\" or \"Labor Day.\" Modul e 5 familiarizes students with the school calendar so that they and their families can be prepared. 3. Refugees contribute to a multicultural America. It is essential that students in t he Refugee Academy be aware of how much they contribute to American schools. The emphasis in the Academy is refugee students becoming acclimated to American schools. It is equally as important to point out what refugee students bring to their classrooms. Students in multicultural cla ssrooms have a better chance of developing global awareness, appreciation of diversit y, better understanding of the freedoms of American life, and tolerance of other religions and cultural traditions. Module 5 So Much to Learn! 5 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9- 12 (45 minutes) Show the videos Refugee Student Interviews and A Day in School (Elementary, Middle, or High School) to provide information and to help students to understand that there are many differ ent ways to learn in American schools. \u0083 Use the Guide to the Videos for introducing the videos and for follow-up discussion. ACTIVITY #1: VIDEOS Module 5 So Much to Learn! 6 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9- 12 - (45 minutes) In this activity: The students will learn th at they make significant contributions to American education . They will discover that they can teach their fellow students about global events and diversity of cult ures. They can help students develop appreciation for the world out side their classrooms. Students in the Refugee Academy can maintain pride in their culture while learning about how to connect different cultures in their new classrooms. Begin by making a tossed salad in front of the class. Add one ingredient at a time, asking the students why the salad represents American schools. Point out the value of multicultural classrooms, and the contributions that the Academy students can make to American schools. Discussion Questions What can you tell me about the country that you came from? Where is it and what did it look like? \u0083 Stress the landscape, size, and location, rath er than political and social activities. Students will inevitably ment ion current events in their countries, perhaps with graphic details. When they do, ask them about the terrain in their native countries and changes in the environment because of current events. Emphasize the variety of environments that they have come from. \u0083 Point out how interesting it is that people from all over the world ended up in one classroom. \u0083 Find the countries on a globe or a world map. ACTIVITY #2: STUDENT CONTRIBUTIONS Module 5 So Much to Learn! 7How many countries are we from - in this room right now? \u0083 Mark the location of the classr oom on a map of the United States. \u0083 Instructors can share informati on about personal cultural heritage. What does this country look like? \u0083 Describe urban/rural/ suburban environments. \u0083 Describe the cultural dive rsity of the United States. \u0083 Students may bring up how American student s dress and talk, and what they are interested in. Address the difficultie s that refugee students may face in maintaining their cultural traditions while trying to fit into their new environment. Discuss the importance of pride in her itage. Acknowledge that some students may want to cast aside native dress, foods , or other traditions. Ask students how they can fit in with Amer ican students and yet stay connected with their personal heritage. \u0083 Students may encounter misconceptions an d stereotypes when interacting with their peers. They may have to answer a lot of questions about their background and culture. They may also be confront ed with strong negative reactions to refugees in America. Di scuss how these attitudes can be handled by refugee students. What has surprised you about this count ry? What do you dislike about it? What do you like? \u0083 Accept the observations of the students. Explain that they may change their minds in the future, and should be careful not to judge. \u0083 Ask how students plan to enjoy what they like about America. How do you think American students can learn from you? 9 World view 9 Understanding of current events 9 Knowledge of geography 9 New languages 9 Tolerance for diversity 9 New ideas, experiences 9 Overcoming resistance, prejudice \u0083 Ask students to describe specific things that fellow students c an learn from them. How do you say WELCOME in your language? \u0083 Demonstrate American greetings ( hi, howdy , greetings , hello , how are ya , etc.), role-played by instructors. Ask students to share \" hello \" and \" welcome \" in their native language. Distribute the Welcome to Our Schools poster for all students to take home. Module 5 So Much to Learn! 8 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (60 minutes) In this activity: The students will learn about the ca lendar of the school year. They will be preparing a school calendar to post at home. They will also learn about American holiday traditions, and the reasons behind the cancellation of specific school days. Distribute Handout 5- 1: School Calendar \u0083 Provide each student with a marker or pen. \u0083 Go through the calendar slowly, month by month, pointi ng out half-days of school, holidays, vacations, testing days, etc. Include the first day of school. \u0083 Show students how to mark each day with a circle or symbol. \u0083 Discuss the details of holidays and vacations: o National - President's Da y, Thanksgiving, etc. o Religious - Christmas, Hanukkah o Community Events - parades, festivals, fireworks \u0083 Discuss vacation activities o Relaxation o Vacation camps o Reading and study time o Extracurricular programs o Child care o Supervision of siblings o Lack of supervision of older students ACTIVITY #3: SCHOOL CALENDAR Module 5 So Much to Learn! 9 Discussion Questions What holidays or special occasions wil l you celebrate with your family? How will you spend your time during y our holidays and vacations when you are not in school? How will you stay safe, especially if you are home alone or supervising siblings? How will you continue to lear n when you are not in school? Module 5 So Much to Learn! 10 JOURNAL TOPIC Grades K-5 Draw or write about what you think you will learn about in school. What can other students learn from you? Grades 6-8 Draw or write about how students in school will be able to learn from you. What will you do if they are resistant or not interested?

Schools offer lunch every day. Students may not realize that lunch is offered every day in school, served in the school cafeteria. Students can either purchase a full lunch on a tray, or items to supplement a lunch that they brought from home. Schools differ in their procedure for paying fo r lunch. Some schools take a \"lunch count\" every morning to find out who will be buying lunch. Some schools have lunch tickets or cards that families pay for at the beginning of the school year, or throughout the year. Review the procedures in the school district. If possible, make arrangements for students to obtain their lunch passes and copies of the school lunch menus. Show them how to get to the cafe teria, how to work the vendi ng machines, what cartons of milk and other food items look like, and how to throw away their garbage and return their trays. Students who may have difficulty paying for lunc h every day may be eligible for \"free lunch\" arranged by the school nurse, social worker, or guidance counselor. Academic Coaches should discuss the lunch form at a parent Open House, and discreetly refer any students who may need assistance in paying for lunch. In some cases, breakfast may be provided as well. Refugee students may have difficulty negotiating the lunch period in the cafeteria. They will have to figure out how to purchase their full lunch or m ilk, desserts, and other items available in the cafeteria line or in vending machines. Then they have to figure out where to sit in the cafeteria. For elementary students, the class usually sits together. For secondary students, determining where to sit in the cafeteria can be a challenge. Students sit with their friends and do not often welcome newcomers to their lunch tables. It is intimidating to approac h a table of strangers and sit down at their table with them. The instructors should discuss the steps involved in eating lunch in the cafeteria, including strategies that can be employed when searching for a place to sit. Discuss how uncomfortable it can feel to be eati ng alone, and ask students what they can do about finding a friend to eat wit h, and what they can do to help a friend who is sitting alone. Explain to students that t he lunch period is a time to socialize, but students are to try to keep their voices low. They are to respond to adults in the cafeteria who are there to maintain discipline, and s hould always clean up their own garbage. Key Points - Sta ying Health y Module 6 Stay Healthy 5 2. American foods will be differen t; try new foods while maintaining personal traditions. Students in the Refugee Academy may enjoy traditional native foods at home, and be resistant to trying new American foods. Encourage students to widen their range of eating experiences. Explain that America has staples such as hamburgers, hot dogs, and apple pie, but in any househol d there will be traditional foods that are eaten all over the world. Student s in urban areas will see that there are international restaurants throughout the ci ty. Their own neighborhoods may have restaurants with familiar cuisine from their native country in addition to American fast- food restaurants and diners, and restaurants with Chinese, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese, or Italian menus. Students need to be reassured that they can st ill maintain their cultural heritage and enjoy familiar foods while tasting new foods from many different countries, including America. 3. Good hygiene can build conf idence and self-esteem, as well as friendships. For a variety of reasons, students may not re alize how to maintain good hygiene. They may not have the experience, the facilities at home, the resources, or the skills. They may not be aware of the number of hygiene pr oducts available in Am erica, or are well aware and totally confused! Bring examples of hygiene items to t he Academy and discuss what they are for. Remind students that good hygie ne can make an them feel proud of their appearance, resulting in more confidence. If students are aware that they are not taking care of their hygiene but are unable to fix the problem, t hey can feel humiliated. Provide everyone with basic information about personal care and where they can obtain the items necessary for personal care. If possible, visit a local drugstore to talk about the numerous products on the shelves. Students may need to be reminded that hygiene will be influential in their ability to develop new friendships. However, never is olate a student and comment on hygiene. Always make the subject a general discuss ion, pointing out a possible hygiene problem, the causes, and the remedies . If it appears that a student does not understand how to maintain personal hygiene (or does not have access to a shower, shampoo, toothpaste, clean clothes, nail clip pers, etc.) then an Academic Coach or school nurse should talk quietly with the student, providing the necessary resources and advice about where to obtain products. Module 6 Stay Healthy 6 It is suggested that the Academic Coaches approach local businesses and drugstores to obtain samples of hygiene items such as toothbrushes, combs, shampoo, soap, deodorant, and laundry detergent. 4. Exercise can build strength, friends hips, confidence and skills, and can reduce stress. Opportunities for exercise are provided by schools during physical education classes, after-school ac tivities, and athletic programs. Community-based organizations often offer programs that encourage exercise. However, it may be very temp ting for refugee students to stay home alone, watching television. They may not feel comfortable participating in after-school and sports programs. They may not know how to join them, or how to play the games. They may not w ant to participate because they do not know anyone. Encourage students to participate in ac tivities that require physical exercise. They may not realize that ex ercise can build their strength and confidence. They can make new friends who have a mutual interest in the activity. They may discover that they have the ability to excel in a particular sport. Students may not realize that exercise can also reduce stress. Point out how satisfying it can feel to run th e bases, shoot a basket, or do karate after a stressful day at school. If they do not enjoy the activity and it is creating more stress, they should seek out something new that is more rewarding. Above all, they should exercise to keep healthy as they adjust to the many dem ands of a new school. 5. Refugee students may have significant health concerns. Many refugee students and their families ha ve serious health concerns. The students may have experienced malnutriti on, physical torture, infectious diseases, and injuries from war. They may have depression, pos t-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and other mental and physical disabilities. Module 6 Stay Healthy 7It may seem insignificant to talk to students about topics such as choosing an apple to eat instead of potato chips, or signing up fo r an exercise class, when they have so many serious health needs. But the purpose of the Refugee Academy is to focus on the future in school, and students need to lear n how to monitor their personal health while adjusting to their new lives. Instructors should be alert for stu dents who may need specialized health care, referrals from the school nurse, support from school social workers and psychologists, or assistance fr om administrators and teachers in planning adapted academic programs due to health concerns. During the Academy, help the students underst and the essential components of good health and make sure that they are getting professional help if needed. 6. The health effects of lead pois oning on children can be devastating, especially because the impact of lead may be invisible. Lead poisoning is one of the most common a nd preventable childhood health problems in the United States. Refugee children c ould have been exposed to lead before they arrived in the United States, or they may be exposed in their current homes. Instructors and Academic Coaches do not need to be experts on lead poisoning. Academic Coaches should follow up on student concerns by contacting the school nurse or the Refugee Resettlement Case Manager. Students do not need to know scientific info rmation about lead in the body. When discussing lead poisoning with students, stress the import ance of hand-washing and eating healthy foods. Background information on lead poisoning Lead is a heavy metal that does not break down and decompose, so it has been used in many products such as water pipes, pewter dishes, paint, and other commercial products. Once it was confirmed in the early 1960s that lead could be a poison, including the dust of lead paint, actions were taken to eliminate the use of lead and to implement screening for lead in infants and children. Lead is a poison that affects almost every syst em in the body. Shortly after lead enters the body through ingestion, hands in the mouth, or inhalation of dust, the lead travels in the blood to the soft tissues such as the liver, kidneys, and brain. The body gradually moves lead from the blood and organs to the bones and teeth, where it can be stored for decades. Any amount of lead in the body is considered toxic. Children under the age of 6 ar e at the greatest risk of heal th effects associated with exposure to lead. They are particularly vulnerable because their brain and central nervous system are still forming. Lead interf eres with the devel opment of these systems as well as the kidney and blood-fo rming organs. In addition, lead can cross the placenta and adversely a ffect a developing fetus. Module 6 Stay Healthy 8Lead poisoning is not always visible, and the vast majority of childr en exposed to lead go undiagnosed and untreated. The effects of lead may occur with no overt outward symptoms, and cognitive damage is not apparent until childr en reach age 4 or later. The behavioral effects of lead are irrevers ible and may not be noticed until the child enters school. Health effects vary from child to child, but examples of the toxic nature of lead are: \u0083 Decrease in IQ points from even very small exposure to lead \u0083 Learning disabilities \u0083 Behavioral problems \u0083 Hyperactivity \u0083 Lethargy \u0083 Stunted or slowed growth \u0083 Impaired hearing \u0083 Difficulty concentrating / attention deficits \u0083 Wrist or foot drop \u0083 Seizures \u0083 Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea \u0083 Encephalopathy (brain dysfunction) \u0083 Nausea, constipation, colic, dyspepsia \u0083 Reproductive damage \u0083 Hypertension \u0083 Deficits in visual-spatial skills, fine motor coordination, balance \u0083 Coma These effects can get worse if nothing is don e to eliminate the lead exposure problem. At increasingly higher levels of exposure, the health effects can be kidney damage, significant IQ deficits, and dev elopmental disabilities such as mental retardation. Children and adults can fall into a coma or die from lead poisoning. The symptoms of lead poisoning can be subt le and they are often confused with other problems in learning, behavior, or health i ssues. For example, a child may have a stomachache or headache, loss of appetite, irrit ability, or hyperactivity. The child may be inattentive or confused, or demonstrate lack of initiati ve or enthusiasm for school activities. All of these behaviors can be misinterpreted as discomfort with school, adjusting to a new school environment, language difficulties, and other factors that would naturally occur when a refugee child is adapting to an American school. But since the symptoms of lead poisoning ar e not always visible as health issues, parents may not understand how lead poisoning can affect the behavior of children. Parents of refugee children may be comfortable with the behavior of their children because their child has always behaved that way, or because the parents are unfamiliar with behavior that is expect ed in an American classroom. For example, if a child is particularly lethargic or unable to pay attention in class, the parents may attribute that to adjusting to a new school (or adjusting to formal education) Module 6 Stay Healthy 9and the demands of life in the new country. They may also indicate that the child has always behaved that way. Academic Coaches can provide information and support to parents or students why may have concerns about behavior in school. Lead poisoning should be considered as a possible explanation for the behavior. Sources of lead poisoning Lead is a natural element that had thousand s of uses, but it is also a powerful neurotoxin that interferes with the development of t he brain and nervous system. Lead poisoning is not limited to the United St ates, although industrialization was a major contributor to the use of lead in public facilities, manufacturing plants, and homes. Lead poisoning is a worldwide problem, particularly in countries where there are no regulations about the use of lead. It is a myth that the problem of lead poisoning is limited to Africa. This myth generated from the death of a Sudanese refugee child in the year 2000. Lead poisoning can be found in both developing countries and in highly industrialized countries anywhere in the world. Refugee children are twice as likel y as U.S. children to have elevated lead levels in their blood. Some are exposed to lead prior to a rriving in the United States, while others are exposed once they are resettled. In developing countries, several factors increase the potential for lead exposure: \u0083 environmental pollution \u0083 absent or lax environ mental regulations \u0083 hot climates that allow for outdoor living and activities (on ground that may contain lead) \u0083 open housing construction, often with lead-painted materials \u0083 concentration of populations around heavy traffic areas. Refugee children may have a compromised imm une or nutritional status that can cause an increase in vulnerability to lead poiso ning. Malnutrition and anemia can enhance lead absorption. Children who mouth or eat non-food it ems, especially soil, can become exposed to lead. Leaded gas, leaded solder, and lead paint have been banned in the United States, but the remnants still remain across the country. Smelters, chemical and battery plants, burni ng of fossil fuels and solid waste, ammunition manufacturing and use, and traditional use of home remedies that contain lead have all contributed to lead in the environment. There are at least 38 million hom es and buildings in the United States that contain lead paint, some of it peeling and covering the area with dust. Leaded gasoline is still in the soil around roads and storage areas. Thousands of lead pipes continue to serve as water service lines in many older United States cities. Module 6 Stay Healthy 10The most common risk hazard is living in an older home (built before 1975), especially those homes that were built before 1950 and are in disrepair. Many refugee families are resettled in older housing because of the affordability and availability. Peeling and chipping paint on the housing exterior and on walls, banisters, windowsills, and radiators often contain lead. The lead paint starts to chip and peel and gets grounded into dust. The tiny pieces of lead can gather in areas that are not often cl eaned, such as corners of windows, between floorboards , and under radiators. The lead dust can become part of the dust in the house and in the soil around the house. Lead hazards have been found in playgrounds, pr imarily due to the age of paint on the playground equipment. School districts are responsible for determining the age and condition of the paint, and should be alert to deteriorating paint. Some dishes and ceramic ware contain lead, even though since 1980 the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has had limits on lead and cadmium in ceramic ware products. However suspect ceramic ware products can enter the United States, especially if they are brought in personal baggage. A glaze or decoration may have high levels of lead that can get into food, wear off on hands, and leave lead dust. Lead can be found in the following products, depending upon the year and the source of production: \u0083 Drinking water (from lead pipes) \u0083 Hair dyes \u0083 Miniblinds \u0083 Calcium and other vitamin \u0083 products \u0083 Playground equipment \u0083 Necklaces \u0083 Toys \u0083 Dishes and lead crystal \u0083 Eye makeup, lipstick, kohl \u0083 Imported wine containers with lead foil wrappers \u0083 Folk remedies such as \"pay-loo-ah\" - a red and orange powder used for fever (Asian origin) \u0083 Imported soldered ca ns containing food Module 6 Stay Healthy 11Lead exposure can also occur in various occupations and hobbies: \u0083 Hobbies such as glazed pottery making, stained glasswork, home remodeling, lead soldering, preparat ion of home remedies \u0083 Employment such as auto repair, weld ing, bridge reconstruction, painting and remodeling, cable splicing, and foundry work may result in lead dust on clothing and car seats if parents wear uniforms home. \u0083 Lead dust from paint can get on household surfaces, floors, toys, blankets and linens, and even pets. Children tend to s pend more time on the floor where lead dust may be present. So what should the students be told? Younger students should be aware that lead may be in paint, paint chips, broken pottery, and some toys. They should be reassured that parents and the Academic Coaches can talk to them about items in their home to determine if they should be checked for lead. It is important to avoid scaring young childr en, but at the same time raise their awareness about how they should think about what they are exposed to at home. Encourage them to wash their hands and keep obj ects (and fingers) out of their mouths. Tell them to talk to the Academic Coach if t hey are afraid that something in their home may contain lead. Older students can be told more information about sources of lead, particularly if they are involved in automobile repair, hobbies, or construction that may expose them to lead. They can also be helpful in asse ssing their home environments and informing their parents about the dangers of expos ure to lead. (Note that Parent Program 4: Lead Poisoning is included in the Welcome to Our Schools Kit .) Lead Screening The first step to determining if there is a problem to address is screening children and adults for lead. The second step is to assess the environment of the refugee families, including their homes, playgrounds, recreational facilities, re ligious centers, and other gathering places. \u0083 Federal standards currently stipulate that a refugee medical screening must take place within 90 days after a refugee's arrival (or status granted) in the United States - for children less t han 7 at the time of arri val or status granted. \u0083 The contents of the screening vary from state to state, and many states do not specify a blood lead level (BLL) screening for refugee children. \u0083 In New York State, refugee children under 7 should have been tested for lead. \u0083 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend testing for children who have emigrated from other countries where lead poisoning is pr esent. Recently local and state health organizations have encouraged BLL screening for adults who are refugees, as Module 6 Stay Healthy 12well as for all refugee families who may have settled in housing in the United States that may contai n lead paint or pipes. Screening children for exposure to lead is done by a finger-stick (or capillary) method. Further testing may be necessary. Instructors can ask students if they remember the simple, quick test that is vital for determining lead levels in the body. Students s hould be reassured that there are treatments and medications available for treating elevated lead levels. \u0083 Once lead exposure is suspect ed, further medical evaluation of health history, environment (past and current), family activities and traditions, mother's habits when pregnan t, food and folk medicines, and other factors associated with lead exposure need to be assessed. This should be done by a physician in conjunction with lead po isoning specialists from a local health department. \u0083 A repeat blood test should be performed three to six months after refugee children are placed in a residence, to determine if BLLs have been reduced or elevated. Resettlement in housing in t he United States may have contributed to higher BLLs that did not exist when the ch ild first arrived. Blood levels can rise quickly, signaling sudden exposure to lead. \u0083 If students are concerned about w hether they were tested, or if they think that they might have been exposed to lead afte r they were tested, they should be encouraged to talk to their Academic Coach. Environmental assessment and cleaning An environmental assessment should be done by a specialist in lead poisoning, but it may not be possible to assess housing before a family is resettled. Older students can be encouraged to take a look at their envir onment and inform thei r parents or Academic Coach if they are concerned about possible exposure to lead. A visual assessment, from floor to ceiling, can be done by walking around the exterior and interior of a building, looking under radi ators, on windowsills, in corners, and in other places such as steps, porches, railings, gutters, spouts, doors, r oof tiles, or cellar entries, that may not be immediately noticeable. Parents and older children can take note of peeling or chipped paint, dust that ha s collected, or any area that needs repair. The instructor should encourage older students to assess all of the places that their family members visit, including child care centers or the hom es of babysitters; playgrounds; recreation centers; and t he homes of friends and relatives. It is difficult to simply relocate refugee families to lead-free housing, especially because alternative housing may not be available. At the same time, ext ensive on-site removal of lead paint can raise the conc entration of dust in the home. Some students may need to assist their par ents in getting advice from the health department, housing agencies, and other expe rts about how to clean up their home environment. If they need assistan ce in contacting those agencies, they can talk to the Academic Coach. Module 6 Stay Healthy 13 Parents can scrape and repaint, as long as they receive instructions on how to do the repairs without further exposu re to lead. Remind students that lead dust can be created during the paint removal process, and the students themselves should not be involved in doing the repairs. If the property owner is not able to provide a certificate of compliance that the property is lead safe, then the refugee fa milies need to know who to contact for assistance. The Refugee Resettlement Case Manager c an provide information about: \u0083 Who can inspect the property for lead \u0083 What is expected of the families before and after a lead inspection \u0083 How the property owner/l andlord will be contacted and what will happen as a result of contacting the property owner \u0083 What will happen to the family if the property is determined to be \"high risk\" or in need of immediate painting and repair Students should be told that families should fr equently wash all toys, pacifiers, bottles, and other items handled by the children in the family. Parents should wet wash floors and other su rfaces. Vacuum cleaners or sweeping can simply spread the dust. If a parent or family member works in an environment w here there might be lead dust (such as a factory or in a home that is bei ng remodeled) then they should assess their exposure to lead and take precautions. A ll work clothing should be removed before entering the home, and clothes should be washed separately. Parents can run tap water for a minute before drinking or cooking with it. If the water has been tested high in lead, install an effe ctive filtering device. Although it is expensive, families may need to switch to bottled water. Families should not eat canned goods from countries outside of the United States. The ban on lead-soldered cans is not worldwide. Parents should discard any dishes and ceramic ware in their homes that are chipped or cracked. This may mean that refugee families have to throw out personal items that are meaningful to them, but they must realize that even handling the item can contribute to lead poisoning. They should not store food in any dishes that might contai n lead, or store food in any antiques or collectibles. Any highly decorat ed or metallic-coated tableware, particularly items made in other countries, shoul d never be used for food or liquids. Ordinary glassware does not contain lead, but lead is still used to make expensive lead crystal. Families should take the same prec autions with crystal. Manufacturers are the best source of information about the contents of eating and cooking utensils. Module 6 Stay Healthy 14 Promoting good hygiene and nutrition Children should be encouraged to wash their hands and keep their hands out of their mouths for general good health and hygiene. Instructors should keep stressing that students should wash their hands often, regardless of whether they have been exposed to lead or not. The students can be reminded that infants and children naturally put things in their mouths and should not be punished when they do. Children are curious and reach for things in areas that may not be routinely cleaned, like corners and under windows and radiators. The environment should be safe and clean. When there is a possibility that students may be exposed to lead, such as on a public playground or in an older building, they shou ld be especially careful about washing their hands and keeping hands out of their mouths. The children may not touch the lead paint directly, but the dust can get on their hands and clothing. (Reassure students that school playgrounds have all been tested for lead.) In addition, students can slow the absorption of lead in their bodies with healthy eating habits. Children under age 6 will g enerally absorb/retain about 50% of the lead that they ingest, but that percentage can be slowed with good nutrition. The consumption of fatty foods should be kept to a minimum (but not eliminated, especially for children under age 2), and children should be receiving adequate leve ls of calcium, iron, vitamin C, and zinc. A diet deficient in iron and calc ium may enhance the amount of lead absorbed. Some of the healthy staples may not be foods that are found in the homes of refugee families because t hey are not part of the traditional diet. Milk, yogurt, cheese, and green leafy vegetables (spinach, kale, collard greens) are good sources of calcium. An iron-rich diet will help to reduce the amount of lead in red blood cells. Good sources of iron include red meats, fish, and chicken; iron-fortified cereals; and dried fruits such as raisins and prunes. Iron is also better absorbed when f oods and juices with vitamin C are part of a daily diet. Fruits, vegetables, and juice, particularly oranges, tomatoes, and green peppers, are exce llent sources of vitamin C. A daily vitamin should be part of a healthy routine at home. Module 6 Stay Healthy 15 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9- 12 (90 minutes) In this activity: Students will discover what foods are offered at lunch in the school cafeteria. Instructors should show samples of a variety of foods from school lunches, including items that may not be familiar to the students, such as milk cartons, ketchup packets, ice cream sandwiches, and peanut butter and jelly. (Check for food allergies, even if the students are not sampling the food.) Some students will be familiar with what t he school has to offer, or at least familiar with traditional American foods. Ot hers may be wary about what their choices are. They may be resistant to trying new foods. Reassure them that they can bring their own lunch to sc hool, but they should be prepared for questions about what they are eating. Show the students how they can bring their lunch in a brown paper bag (generally the preferred way of high school students), or a soft lunch box (popular with middle school students), or a hard lunch box (usually brought by elementary students). They will not be able to refrigerate their food, and should wrap food carefully. Above all, emphasize the charac teristics of a healthy diet. \u0083 Set up 5 trays of food from th e cafeteria and 3 bag lunches. Two of the bag lunches should be staples of an American lunch diet, such as peanut butter and jelly, potato chips, celery and carrot sticks, cookies, and a carton of milk. One brown bag should have food native to the country of refugee students. o Describe each food , explaining that different foods are offered every day in school. A school lunch menu is oft en provided so that students can plan which days they want to buy lunch. o Discuss: \u0083 Choices in buying or bringing lunch to school \u0083 Payment options ACTIVITY 1: THE FOOD AT SCHOOL Module 6 Stay Healthy 16 \u0083 Lunch count that is often taken in homeroom or elementary classrooms \u0083 Seating in the cafeteria \u0083 Food options \u0083 Cleanup \u0083 Noise level; moving around the cafeteria \u0083 Lunch aides \u0083 American student eating habits \u0083 Suggested foods to pack for lunch \u0083 Possible reactions to refugee traditional native foods \u0083 Distribute a typical snack from the school cafeteria for students to sample, such as pudding or fruit cup, and discuss healthy eating at school. Discussion Questions What foods here look good? \u0083 The topic of food may be a sensitive subject for students, depending upon their personal history with food. They may have experienced extreme hunger, food sensitivities and allergies, a constant di et of the same food, or limited options from home. \u0083 Students may be embarrassed by their lunch from home. Discuss how healthy eating is important, and the school will arrange for everyone to be able to have a healthy lunch. \u0083 Encourage students to try new foods, even if they do not look appealing. Discuss how to handle a situation if they dislike a new food. What if you cannot buy lunch every day? \u0083 Explain that if students think they wil l need to have to skip lunch for financial reasons, they should tell the Academic Coach and arrangements will be made for a free lunch. All arrangem ents will be confidential. Module 6 Stay Healthy 17\u0083 The Academic Coach will assist students in arranging for lunch payment and the purchase of lunch tickets or cards. \u0083 Discuss the expense of using vending machines every day, and the impact of snacks on overall health. \u0083 Discuss the cafeteria line, and how it may move quickly. Lunch aides may want immediate decisions about food choice s and payment. Inform students that the first few times through the cafeteria line they may feel rushed and confused, but eventually they will recognize the food (because it will keep reappearing throughout the school year) and they will discover what they like. What if you are still hungry? \u0083 Snacking is not permitted in class. \u0083 Students can supplement their lunches by purchasing snacks, but they must be eaten in the cafeteria. \u0083 If students are participating in an after-school program, they might want to pack a snack in their backpack. Re mind students about healthy snacks. . Module 6 Stay Healthy 18 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9- 12 (45 minutes) Show the videos Refugee Student Interviews and A Day at School (Elementary, Middle or High School). \u0083 Use the Guide to the Videos for introducing the videos and for follow up discussion. ACTIVITY 2: VIDEO Module 6 Stay Healthy 19 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (30 minutes) In this activity: Students will learn about the bas ics of personal hygiene. They will also discuss the impact of hygiene on self- confidence and friendships. \u0083 Distribute Handout 6-1: Staying Healthy . Describe each item on the handout and explain how they help students stay clean and healthy. o Discuss the emphasis that is in American culture on washing daily; keeping hair, hands and face clean; having no body odor; and keeping teeth clean. o Discuss the social impact of hygiene. o Explain that cultural traditions can be maintained as long as students are clean and tend to their personal hygiene. o Discuss access to personal care items. o Discuss washing hands in the rest rooms. o Students often forget that they should care for their feet, nails, and shoes to maintain personal hygiene. \u0083 Distribute free samples of personal care items, if available. o If it seems necessary, demonstrate the use of personal care items. \u0083 Discuss the role of the school nurse. Adolescent girls should meet with the school nurse about personal hygiene. (Determine if school policy requires parental permission.) ACTIVITY 3: PERSONAL HYGIENE Module 6 Stay Healthy 20 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (30 minutes) In this activity: Students will have the opportunity to participate in an exercise activity that is fun and entertaining. They will discover that exercise comes in many forms, including dance. The students themselves c an demonstrate dances of thei r native countries, or the instructors may want to invite guests to teach dances from around the world. Classmates can bring music to the class and demonstrate how American students dance when they att end school dances and parties. \u0083 Demonstrate dances from different cultures . \u0083 Demonstrate and teach current American dances . o Discuss dance moves that are inappr opriate, including many that are seen on popular television programs. This may be difficult to explain, but students should be aware of what will be unacceptable at school dances, and what is considered to be inappropr iate by most adults and students. o If the instructors are u nable to arrange for guests to demonstrate dances, the students can listen to music from a variety of countries while they toss a tennis ball, playground ball, or beach ball, to the beat of the music. Discuss the many benefits of exercise. ACTIVITY 4: GETTING EXERCISE Module 6 Stay Healthy 21 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: Students will review healthy foods as a source of protection from illnesses and lead poisoning. Before carrying out this activi ty, make sure that a healthy snack is available to serve ev eryone at the conclusion of the activity. The students will be looking at food and might get hungry. Check for food allergies in advance. It is best to avoid serving peanut butter or anything with nuts or berries in case students have undiagnosed allergies. \u0083 In the front of the room, display the following snacks: o Banana and yogurt o Apple and cheese o Broccoli and sour cream dip o Carrot sticks and soft cheese o V-8 juice or other healthy juices (low-sugar) o Vegetable soup and milk \u0083 Ask the students to i dentify the snack items. o Ask students to raise their hands to vo te for the snack that they would enjoy the most if it were offered to them at home. (Make sure it is clear that they will not receive the snack if they vote for it!) o Then ask the students to vote on which snack is the healthiest. Ask them which one is better for their health. The answer is that all of the s nacks are healthy, and the foods can be eaten individually or in any co mbination as a healthy snack. \u0083 Distribute Handout 6-4 Good Nutrition and discuss the pictures of food on the handout. Discuss how eating foods that are healthy can build protection from health problems. With older students, discuss the nutri ents in the foods that build better health (calcium, ir on, vitamin C, zinc, etc.). ACTIVITY 5: GOOD AND HEALTHY Module 6 Stay Healthy 22Explain to students how a strong, healthy body is better prepared to handle illness, and tell them they s hould reach for a healthy snack to take care of their health. \u0083 Serve a snack and discuss how the snack will build better health. Compliment the students on taking care of their health. o While the students are eating their s nacks, explain that fresh foods are the best source of vitamins. Vitamins can be in other prepared foods such as cereals, pasta, cheese, bottled tomato sauce, and canned fruit. Fresh or frozen meats can also contain important vitamins. o Show samples of these foods and enc ourage students to eat a mixture of them daily. o Explain that sometimes they will not get all of the vitamins that they need from foods, so they should take a daily vitamin. Show different types of vitamins (chewables, cartoon char acters, fruit-flavored, etc.) and encourage students to talk to their parent s about taking a daily vitamin. Module 6 Stay Healthy 23 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 In this activity: Students will learn how to select foods that are healthy. They will discover that choosing fresh foods in many different colors can result in a balanced, healthy diet. \u0083 Explain to students that an easy way to eat healthy foods is to choose lots of different colors during the day. \u0083 The healthiest foods are fr esh (not from a box or a can) and come in many different colors. Examples are: Oranges purple eggplant Blueberries green and purple grapes Strawberries brown, white, red potatoes Red, green, yellow, and orange peppers yams Greens carrots White and brown mushrooms dairy products Red and green apples \u0083 If possible, show examples of the m any different colors of fresh foods. \u0083 Distribute handouts 6-5: Fruit to Color and 6-6: Vegetables to Color for students to color. \u0083 Discuss the names of the fruits and vegetables depicted on the handouts. ACTIVITY 6: CHOOSING HEALTHY FOODS Module 6 Stay Healthy 24 JOURNAL TOPIC Grades K-5 Draw a picture of the foods that you will eat at school and the foods that you will eat at home. Grades 6-8 Draw or write about your plans for eating lunch at school. Include potential problems and how you will solve them. Describe new foods that you want to try. Choos e foods that have good nutrition. Grades 9-12 Draw or write about your plans for eating lunch at school. Include potential problems and how you will solve them. Describe new foods that you want to try. Choos e foods that have good nutrition. Draw or write about how you can help to prevent lead poisoning. SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES \u0083 Tour the school cafeteria. \u0083 Tour local restaurants, grocer y stores, and fast food centers. Discuss healthy eating as you tour. \u0083 Practice moving through the lunch line, paying for food, and eating in the cafeteria. \u0083 Invite dancers or arrange for dance instruction in current American dances that will be se en at school dances and parties. \u0083 Describe \"proms\" or \"formals\" or \"senior balls\" and so forth. If possible, show pictures of special school dances. \u0083 Invite the school nurse to talk about personal hygiene. \u0083 Invite representatives from local community agencies to demonstrate exercise programs t hat are available to students and families, including basketball, yoga, swimming, ice skating, and dance. Visit the classes if possible, and explain to students how they can enro ll. Encourage them to try something new. Module 6 Stay Healthy 25 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 In this activity: Students will learn about lead poisoning. A series of photos will be shown to the students to inform them about the causes and impact of lead poisoning. Since many students will be fa miliar with the word \"poison,\" the activity may make them uncomfortable or scared. PHOTOS ARE LOCATED IN SECTION C - HANDOUTS FOR MODULE 6. Emphasize that students can talk to their Academic Coach or Refugee Resettlement Case Manager if they have any further questions. \u0083 Explain to the students that there are some things in the environment that are unhealthy . One of these things is lead , sometimes found in homes. \u0083 Show the pictures from the Lead Poisoning Information Photo Series , reading aloud the script at the end of this module. \u0083 Make sure that the photos are hel d up so that everyone can see them. \u0083 Speak slowly and allow for translation of the script. \u0083 Pause frequently and ask students if they have any questions. \u0083 Complete the entire script. \u0083 Explain to students that parents will also see the pictur es at a parent program, and they can talk to their family me mbers about what they have learned about lead. Ask the following questions, leading a di scussion to raise awareness about lead poisoning and the role of good hygiene and nutrition: Have you noticed anything in your home that may have lead? o Ask students what they have seen. ACTIVITY 7: LEAD POISONING Module 6 Stay Healthy 26 o Explain that all American families are inspecting for lead and may be painting over old paint, replaci ng cookware, and throwing out glazed pottery and toys that may contain lead. o Explain that they can inspect thei r home environment with their parents. o Distribute Handout 6-3: Possible Sources of Lead for the students to take home and share with their parents. o Inform Academic Coaches about student s who have indicated that they have noticed possible sources of lead in their homes. Academic Coaches can then talk to the Re fugee Resettlement Case Manager. How many of you are responsible for watchi ng a brother or sister or other family member? What can you do to protect them from lead? o Discuss possible sources of lead in the home and what can be done. o Encourage students to wash the hands of siblings and watch closely what they may be putting in their mouths. o Students who are responsible for s upervising other children should know that they can talk to the Academic Coach if they are concerned about exposure to lead. What foods can you eat that will help to fight off lead poisoning? o It is important that students underst and that eating spinach and drinking milk are not the \"cures\" for lead poiso ning. Explain that any exposure to lead is bad for the body. o Explain that healthy foods do not stop lead poisoning but can make the body stronger. For older students, expl ain that less damage will occur if the body is in good health. o Explain that testing for lead poisoning was done when they arrived in the United States, but it is still necessary to get tested if anyone has been exposed to lead - even if they have a healthy diet. o Review the pictures of food on Handout 6-4: Good Nutrition. Have you ever seen anyone put their fi ngers in their mouths? How about babies chewing on toys and rattles? o Explain that babies and young children naturally put their fingers and hands in their mouths. It is hard to stop young children from doing this, especially when they are infants who are teething, or toddlers who are playing with toys. o Acknowledge that people of all ag es often eat with their fingers. Module 6 Stay Healthy 27 o Explain that young children should not play on floors that have lead chips or dust. Toys should be washed frequently with soap and water. o Explain that parents will learn how to check toys for lead if they attend a parent program. Older students can be advised about websites (see Supplies) that provide information about toys with lead. When is the next time that you will wash your hands? o Explain that at any age hands should be washed frequently. Students should wash their hands: \u0083 After using the restroom \u0083 Before and after eating \u0083 After school \u0083 Before and after sports activities \u0083 Before and after playing with fri ends, especially if they are ill \u0083 When handling food \u0083 Before handling a newborn \u0083 Before and after a doctor's appointment o Emphasize that if there is any possi bility of lead exposure, hands should be washed. Take a break so that everyone can go to the restroom and prac tice washing their hands. (Make sure that the restrooms are equipped with soap and paper towels.) If possible, distribute a bar of soap and hand towel to each student to take home. Module 6 Stay Healthy 28 SCRIPT The number corresponds to the picture to be displayed. Instructor: \u0083 I am going to show you some pictures while I tell you about something that is important to know. \u0083 Watch and listen carefully so that you can learn how to take care of your health. \u0083 I am going to be talking about something called lead poisoning. PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 1 Lead is a metal that has been used in many products: Such as paint 2 Or pipes that bring water to your home 3 Dishes 4 Toys 5 Some types of makeup 6 And some types of jewelry. 7 Lead was also used in gasoline and factories around the world. Lead Poisoning Photo Information Series Refugee Academy Student Activity 7: Stay Healthy See SECTION C - HA NDOUTS FOR MODULE 6 FOR PHOTOS Module 6 Stay Healthy 29 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 8 Several years after lead was used in many different products, it was discovered that lead is a poison that can affect all parts of the body. Not everything contains lead, but there are still many products that have lead in them. Laws have been passed to stop the use of lead in products. Doctors and nurses test children and adults to see if they have been exposed to lead and have it in their bodies. 9 You were tested for lead when they came to this country, and will be tested again in a few months. You may remember that the doctor or nurse did a simple finger prick test when you arrived. Does anyone remember that test that the doctor did? 10 If children have lead in their bodies, then doctors can tell parents what to do. 11 There are medicines and treatm ents that can flush out the poisonous lead. 12 How can people get exposed to lead? How does it get in your body? The most common source of lead is paint. 13 When paint with lead in it gets old it can chip and peel and crumble into dust. Module 6 Stay Healthy 30 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 14 The pieces of paint and paint dust can get on the furniture 15 on the floor where children play - 16 on the dishes and in the food when the dust is in the air 17 and hidden in corners and under heating systems like radiators. 18 You often play on the floor, right? Little children crawl on the floor and chew on rattles, toys, blankets, and other objects 19 like stuffed animals. 20 They tend to put their hands in their mouths. That is how the lead from the paint chips and dust gets into their bodies. Remember - lead is not everywhere, but if there is old, chipped paint, then there might be lead in it. Any amount of lead in the body is too much and can be poisonous. What can happen? 21 Children can get sick. They can get stomach aches and headaches. Module 6 Stay Healthy 31 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 22 They may have trouble with their balance. 23 Sometimes they have problems in school. They can't pay attention 24 They might be very tired or they might have trouble concentrating. Children with lead poisoning may fall way behind in school. 25 School is hard for them. There could be many reasons for this, but one of them could be because they have lead poisoning. If you are concerned about how you are doing in school, talk to your Academic Coach. If you think that you are always tired or having trouble paying attention in school, then talk to your Academic Coach. Or if you just don't feel good, tell your Academic Coach. You are probably fine! School is hard sometimes. School is hard sometimes. There are going to be times when you feel tired or might have a stomach ache. But if you feel like this a lot, especially if you think there might be lead in the paint in your home, then talk to your Academic Coach who will discuss it with your Refugee Resettlement Case Manager. Module 6 Stay Healthy 32 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 26 You can help your family protect themselves from lead poisoning! 27 The first thing you need to do is take a good look around your home. Do you see chipped and peeling paint? 28 Look in attics, cupboards , and in the corners. If you think that you have lead in your home, talk to your Academic Coach. 29 Your Academic Coach will talk to the Refugee Resettlement Case Manager and they will let your family know how to get your home cleaned an d painted if there is lead in it. 30 What else can you do to prevent lead poisoning? Remember that lead is not in everything. But it's a good idea to wash you hands often. Wash them before and after you play with friends. Wash them before you eat. And keep their hands out of your mouth. Little babies and your younger brothers and sisters will naturally put things in their mouths. So make sure that they are not chewing on things that have been exposed to lead dust. Make sure that they are not pl aying on a floor that has lead dust. Help them to wash their hands. Module 6 Stay Healthy 33 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 31 Help your parents to keep things clean in the house 32 including the window blinds. Window shades and window sills can collect dust with lead in it. You can help clean up dust by using a wet mop and not a broom. Everyone should help to keep the house clean! If your house has lead paint then your parents can get help in getting it removed - or the house can be repainted. Your Academic Coach can help you if you need information for your parents. 33 How else can you protect yourself from lead poisoning? A very important thing you can do is eat a healthy diet. If you eat good foods there is less damage from lead poisoning. 34 Make sure that you eat lots of fresh fruits 35 and vegetables. 36 Eat some milk, cheese, yogurt, and eggs. 37 Raisins are a very good snack! 38 Eat cereal with milk and fruit. Module 6 Stay Healthy 34 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 39 And try to have protein every day, like fish 40 or beef and chicken Your job is to make sure that your body is strong and healthy. So remember: \u0083 Wash your hands \u0083 Eat a healthy diet \u0083 Look around to make sure that you and your family are not exposed to lead. \u0083 Share this information about lead poisoning with your friends and your relatives so that they can also keep their children safe. \u0083 And you can always talk to your Academic Coach is you have any questions Lead Poisoning Photo Information Series (Student Program) 1. 2.

OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Become familiar with extra- curricular activities to determine interests and talents \u0083 Learn about opportunities for involvement in sports in American education \u0083 Become familiar with community-based after-school and weekend programs SUPPLIES Handout 7 - 1: What Do You Enjoy? Handout 7 - 2: After School Plans Video A Day in School (Elementary, Middle or High School) Sports equipment: basketball; hockey stick and puck (field and ice); baseball and glove; Frisbee; swim cap; volleyball; football; chalk (gymnastics) Ballet slippers Musical Instruments Cooking equipment Costume and wig Brochures from local community-based programs (YMCA, Boys/Girls Club, sports organizations, etc.) Module 7 Interests and Talents 2MODULE 7: Interests and Talents VOCABULARY Elementary Vocabulary Secondary Vocabulary Baseball Basketball Frisbee Swimming Vacation Break Volleyball Soccer Football Talent Interest Baseball Basketball Frisbee Swimming Games (sports) Volleyball Vacation Break Football Talent Interest Practice Soccer Coach Permission Module 7 Interests and Talents 3 1. Students can develop interests and talents in the classroom, after school, and at community centers on the weekend and during school vacations. For many of the refugee students, enrollment in American schools opens up many opportunities to investi gate new areas of interest. They may discover skills and talents that t hey did not even know they had. Or they may have a chance to further develop interests and talents that they were already exploring in their native countries. Students should be informed that they ca n participate in extracurricular programs after school during st udent organization and club meetings. They can join or try out for athletic teams. They can walk or take the bus to community organizations that provide recreational activities, cla sses, clubs, and special events that expose students to a variety of new areas of intere st. Many organization s provide after-school activities in the community, and may also be open on the weekends and in the evenings. They may also provide vacation camps and summer programs. Encourage students to expand their educ ation beyond the school day. Encourage them to try many new activities, even if they have no experience or no one to attend with them. They will not only learn new ski lls and develop new interests and talents, they will meet new friends. Give examples of peers and adults who have taken classes that have resulted in a hobby or profession. Perhaps a teacher is an amateur photographer after taking a photography class, a student works at a local restaurant after joining a c ooking class, or another student has decided to pursue acting as a career after trying out for a school play. 2. A variety of programs are offered by schools and by community organizations. Module 7 provides information about pr ograms in the school and surrounding community that are designed to provide enter tainment, fun, and ski ll development for the students. The programs can include sports , music, dance, and art, as well as service and volunteer opportunities. Dependi ng upon the facilities and the interests of the local community, the pr ograms can emphasize competit ion, parental involvement, skill acquisition, academic support, or simply enjoyment. Key Points - Interests and Talents Module 7 Interests and Talents 4For example, community centers may offer ba sketball clinics, cooking classes, dance programs, and youth groups. Schools may have a number of clubs, music groups, dances, and theatrical productions. Students may be easily deterred if they ar e unfamiliar with the style of uniform required, or are hesitant to participate in an activity that may not be accepted by their families for religious or cultural reasons. Ex plain the value of participating in programs that build skills and enhance social experie nces, but inform students that they must discuss their interests with their parents. There may be a temptation for the students to become involved in a number of different programs, particularly if the st udent is excited about trying many new things. Make sure that students under stand that schoolwork should be completed and grades should be satisfactory before they par ticipate in after-school activities. 3. School programs may be offered sp ecifically to cultivate talents. Occasionally students may demonstrate a unique talent. A teacher may spot it or a parent may point it out to the school. The ta lent could be related to such areas as visual arts, sports, mechanics, or music, but students coul d also show a talent for service work or leadership. Inform students about opportunities to enroll in classes for Provide students with specific information about the programs available in the area, including: 9 Schedule of the program 9 Possible transportation options 9 Fee required, and methods for fee reduction or waiver 9 Where equipment and supplies can be purchased or obtained for free 9 Permissions required from parents and physicians 9 Level of competitiveness 9 Skill emphasis 9 Parental involvement 9 Community support 9 Systems for enrolling, trying out, attending Module 7 Interests and Talents 5the gifted, or how to obtain specializ ed instruction in specific areas of talent (e.g., individual lessons, internships, advanced placement). Provide information about where student s can attend classes to expand upon their skills, perhaps at local museum s or postsecondary institutions. Invite representatives from the Big Brothers Big Sisters program to talk to students. Connect students with piano teachers, soccer coaches, camp directors, and so forth. Observe participants in the Refugee Academy and find ways to cultivate their interests and talents. Perhaps they can try out for a sports team, join a Math Olympics or similar team, compete in the College Academic Bowl, or run for office in the school. Many of the students in the Refugee Acad emy will not know that these options are possible. When reviewing the possibilities, keep in mind that students may need detailed explanations. For example, to tell the student s that they can \"try out for football\" assumes that they know what football is and what it means to \"try out.\" They will not only need descriptions, they will need pict ures, demonstrations, examples of equipment and uniforms, and an ecdotes from instructor s who can present with enthusiasm, and from peers who joined a program and enjoyed themselves. Module 7 Interests and Talents 6 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (120 minutes) In this activity: Students will discover the vari ety of extracurricular programs that are available for them in school and in the local community. The purpose of this activity is not only to inform students about the many choices that they will have in pursuing interests and talents, but to expose them to classes, clubs, special events, tutoring, and other programs t hat focus on topics that will be brand-new to many of the students. Take time to describe the pr ograms in detail, encouraging students to identify activities that appeal to them, even if they have never tried any of the activities before. \u0083 Distribute Handout 7-1: What Do You Enjoy? o Discuss each activity, showing \"tools of the trade\" such as ballet slippers, musical instruments, basketball, and so forth. (See the Supplies list for suggestions.) Explain: \u0083 What the school offers \u0083 What the community offers \u0083 Benefits of participation \u0083 How to get involved \u0083 Levels of difficulty \u0083 Sign-ups versus tryouts \u0083 Parental involvement \u0083 Community involvement ACTIVITY #1: WHAT ARE YOUR INTERESTS ? Module 7 Interests and Talents 7\u0083 Schedule and time invested \u0083 Requirements \u0083 How to improve \u0083 Recognition o For as many activities as possible, introduce a guest coach, teacher, or community organization director w ho can provide information about available activities. o Academy instructors can demonstrate interests and talents such as: \u0083 Playing guitar \u0083 Making a video \u0083 Sketching a picture \u0083 Tap dancing \u0083 Cooking Show that enjoyment is the benefit, regardless of the level of talent. o Invite students to discuss the activities, observing: \u0083 Comfort level with each activity \u0083 Past experience \u0083 Evidence of talent \u0083 Uncertainty about interests \u0083 Uncertainty about trying something new \u0083 Insecurity about skills o Complete Handout 7-1: What Do You Enjoy? with additional illustrations of special interests. \u0083 Ask students what they have seen adults or their peers do that requires skill or talent. For exam ple, students may pass a karate studio on the way to school, or watch a volleyball game in a park, or observe an artist sketching buildings in the neighborhood. Students may not realize that they can pursue those same interests in clubs and classes. Module 7 Interests and Talents 8 Show the video A Day in School (Elementary, Middle or High School) to provide new information and to encourage students to pursue new interests and cultivate talents . Use the Guide to the Videos for introducing the video and for follow- up discussion. Module 7 Interests and Talents 9 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (30 minutes) In this activity: Students will meet with the instructors and discuss plans for participating in after-school activities. Students can meet with the instructors in small groups, or individually with their Academic Coach. \u0083 Divide students into groups and with each student discuss Handout 7-2: After School Plans individually, helping them to make plans for participation in an extracurricular activity. o Discuss: \u0083 Benefits \u0083 Expectations of schools \u0083 Fee coverage \u0083 Transportation \u0083 No pressure \u0083 Possible parental resistance \u0083 Friends attending together Ask students to discuss Handout 7-2: After-School Plans with their parents. ACTIVITY #2: AFTER SCHOOL Module 7 Interests and Talents 10 JOURNAL TOPIC Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 How will I learn new things in school and after school? SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES \u0083 Take field trips to sports si tes, club meetings, special events in the community, and classes at local activity centers. \u0083 Arrange for experiences in dance, specific sports, art projects, and other skill-based activities that are offered by schools and community organizations. \u0083 Invite students to talk about their involvement in extracurricular activities, and to demonstrate the skills they have learned. \u0083 Introduce students with demonstrated talents to special programs and teachers. \u0083 Invite instructors to demonstr ate what they teach. Encourage them to reassure students that many of the skills do not require fluency in English, just a desire to learn and try new things. \u0083 Talk to local community organizations about how to modify curriculum and instruction so that refugee students can feel comfortable in their programs. If possible, identify volunteer translators who can assist in instruction during community programs. \u0083 Give the students the opportunity to try on uniforms, experiment with the tools that artists use, look through the lens of a camera, and participat e in other experiences that might pique their interest. MODULE 8 GETTING HELP Module 8 Getting Help 1MODULE 8: Getting Help PURPOSE The purpose of Module 8 is to encourage students to recognize school personnel and peers as a source of information and support. OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Understand the role of teachers as a source of information and support \u0083 Understand the role of the Academic Coach as a source of personal support \u0083 Understand the role of communication between parents and schools \u0083 Understand the role of peers as a resource for information and support SUPPLIES Handout 8 - 1: Teachers Handout 8 - 2: Academic Coach Handout 8 - 3: Parent Note Guest students (see Activity #3) Videos: Refugee Student Interviews and A Day in School (Elementary, Middle or High School) Module 8 Getting Help 2 MODULE 8: Getting Help VOCABULARY Elementary Vocabulary Secondary Vocabulary Aide Questions Problems Succeed Newcomer Nice Name Home Family Parent Mr., Mrs., Ms. Aide Guidance Interpreter Problems Succeed Report Card Assignment Grades Study Nice Schedule Name Mr., Mrs., Ms. Family Parent Home Trouble Communication Module 8 Getting Help 3 1. Teachers are resources and want students to succeed. Some refugees may not have attended sc hool in their native countries, and may not know the role of a teacher. They may have misconceptions about teachers and they may be afraid of them. Other students may have had teachers they remember fondly and find it difficult to adjust to teachers in American schools. Still others have experienced teachers who were primarily disc iplinarians and they may assume that all teachers in American schools w ill behave the same way. The purpose of Module 8 is to explain to stu dents that all teachers ar e different in their styles and expectations, but they ultimately do want students to succeed. There are, of course, a few exceptions, but primarily t eachers will not only dispense knowledge, they will provide guidance and support to students who make the effort to achieve. Many teachers will reach out to students who are struggling in school, or who are having difficulty behaving in cla ss, concentrating on their work, or getting along with other students. They want students to succeed, and will provide information and guidance w hen students need assistance. Even when most teachers discipline students it is for the purpose of reining in negative behavior so that students can focus on succeeding in school. Refugee students should know that if they follow school ru les and treat teachers with respect, they will build good relationships with teachers. If they work hard in class and alert teachers when they need help, they will fi nd that teachers will respond positively and provide assistance. 2. The Academic Coach provides individual guidance, information, and support. During the first session of the Refugee Acad emy, the Academic Coaches introduced themselves and explained their role during the school year. However, the students were more than likely overwhelmed with in formation during the first session as they attempted to adjust to their new environment. In Module 8 the instructors should remi nd the students again abou t how the coaches will help the students duri ng the Academy and throughout the school year. They should provide students with Handout 8-2: Academic Coach which has the name of the Key Points - Gettin g Help Module 8 Getting Help 4 coach and contact information. The students are to show the handout to their parents and post the information for refer ence for the entire family. The instructors should give the students a copy of Handout 8-2: Academic Coach (or a business card) for the students to keep in their wallet or notebook. The students should know that any time during the school day they can ask for a meeting to be arranged with their personal Academic Coach. 3. Schools communicate with parent s to encourage student success. In Module 13: Keeping Families Informed , the students have the opportunity to learn about a number of different ways that school s facilitate communication between the teachers and the parents. But before they l earn about the specifics of school-to-home communication, the students may need to be intr oduced to the notion that the schools will communicate with the parents on a routine basis. This may be a new concept for many students. The refugee students may not realize t hat parents will be told that they can call the teacher at any time, and that teachers may contact the parents if they have any concerns about a student's achievement or behavior. Module 8 provides information on how sc hools communicate with parents. The students should know that teachers will not only send home report card s, they will also invite parents in for conferences, call home if necessary, and send home handouts that describe their classroom rules and assignmen ts. They may send home interim reports that describe the progress of students or problems in class. Students should be reassured that the main reason teachers contact parents is to identify and implement strategies that will lead to student success. Scheduled events such as Open House (when parents visit the school in the evening), parent-teacher confer ences, Education Week (when many schools invite parents into the cla ssrooms during the school day), and concerts, science fairs, and school plays all allow parents to see what their children are learning in school. 4. Peers are a natural sour ce of information and support. A valuable source of support for student s is peers. It is important that the Academic Coaches work with teachers and administrators to provide peer support for refugee students. Many teachers do assign a classmate to help a new student during the first few days of school, or they may have a \"buddy\" or \"mentoring\" system to help new students learn about the school envir onment and procedures. However, the Module 8 Getting Help 5 system is often informal and dependent upon the ability of the students to communicate with each other. Some students feel uncomfortable or embarrassed if they are forced to accompany a refugee new comer to classes. Others may try to be helpful but find it frustrating if they do not know the language or cu stoms of the refugee student. In some circumstances the teacher will assume that a child from one part of the world will automatically be helpful to another refu gee student from the same country or a country nearby. For example, a student from Vietnam who is already enrolled in the school may be enlisted to help a new student from Korea. Although the students may have some similarities, it cannot be assumed that they will instant ly bond or will have shared the exact same background. It may be frustrating for both students to be linked together, thus reinforcing the stereotypical notion that the culture and language of the countries are the same. New students can certainly benefit from learning from their refugee peers who have been in the school for a while and can s hare helpful information. But new students need the opportunity to connect with American students, not only to \"learn the ropes,\" but to possibly form new friendships. Younger students seem to adju st more readily to the newcomers and generally make efforts to make friends and help ou t, especially with teacher encouragement. Secondary students may be uncomfortable or even wary about being assigned to a new student. They may be well in tentioned in their efforts to help, but if the refugee student cannot communicate or is shy or afraid, then students often do not know how to handle the situation. They ma y prefer to be with their ow n friends and do not want to be associated with someone who is different fr om them. Instructor s should consult with teachers and guidance counselors about students in the school who would comfortably assist a new student, and would introduce them to others, show them how to function in the school environment, and apprecia te the culture of the new student. Peer support should start right away. B egin by making connections between students in the Refugee Academy. The students who are enrolled in the Academy can share information, keep an eye out for each other , and support each other during difficult adjustments. Encourage the class members to form support partnerships and groups, meeting with the Academic Coach during t he school year. They should branch out beyond their peers in the Academy, but if syste ms are set up so that they can remain in contact, it can be reassuring to know that peers have something in common that they can share. Coaches may want to establ ish a regular meeting time for the students to have a reunion and follow-up meetings. Then invite peers who will be in their classe s to visit the Refugee Academy and meet with the refugee students. Explain to t he classmates of the refugee students how difficult it is to adjust to a new school, especially if the student has difficulty speaking the English language. Show the visitors how to be of assistance in a way that is respectful and helpful. Encourage them to help the students out when school begins. Talk to teachers and guidance counselors to determine w ho would be the best students to invite. Include peers who will demonstr ate an interest in the Academy students and will follow through in hel ping them when school begins. Module 8 Getting Help 6It is important to point out to the refugee students that, unfortunatel y, not all of their future classmates will be helpful. They may deliberately confuse or embarrass the new students. Some students will tease or supply false information. For example, common misinformation provided to new students incl udes inappropriate slang words, behaviors that are against the rules, and offers to sell the students items that are either non- existent or off lim its for students. Explain to students that they should first tr ust their judgment about whether they think they are being told the trut h. If the situation feels unc omfortable and embarrassing, then they are probably not being given reliable information. Suggest that they observe other students carefully to see their reac tion, watch to see if others engage in the activity being promoted, and politely listen unt il they are certain that they are getting good advice from a classmate. In ti me they will know who to trust. Module 8 Getting Help 7 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (60 minutes) In this activity: Students will learn about the many roles that teachers play in educating students. For some students, the information about teachers will be completely new. Others may have preconceived notions about the expectati ons of teachers and their impressions may not be positive. Keep reminding students that teacher s are in their classrooms to provide information and assistance so that the students can learn and achieve. Explain that some teachers are in \"s elf-contained\" classrooms (primarily in elementary classrooms where most academic subjects are covered in one classroom) and will be the student 's teacher all day, with the exception of classes in Art, Physi cal Education, Library, and Music. Some students may leave the classroom for a short time to meet with a speech teacher, or music lesson teacher, or to participate in an English as a Second Language class. At the secondary level the student s will have different teachers for different subjects and the students will rotate from class to class. Again, this may be a new concept for students and they may find it confusing. Reassure them that it does not take long to know the teachers and to get used to their different styles. Provide examples of how teachers approach their instruction in different ways. For example, some teachers lecture, others promote class di scussions, and others demonstrate with drama and flair, engaging their students in activities and projects. The style may be determined by the content and academic level of the course, but the personality of the t eacher will also influence what the class is like. Some classrooms will have preservice or \"student\" teachers, substitute teachers, or classroom aides. The s udden arrival of a substitute teacher can be disarming to a new student. Explain that substitutes are temporary, but they are qualifi ed and should be treated with respect. Explain how all teachers are to be treated and addressed. ACTIVITY #1: KNOW YOUR TEACHERS AND ACADEMIC COACHES Module 8 Getting Help 8 Distribute Handout 8-1: Teachers and discuss the information on the handout. Discussion Questions When you went to school before Am erica, what did your teachers do? \u0083 Some students may not have had teacher s or will describe their teachers in a negative manner. \u0083 Students may miss their old teachers and feel a sense of loss as the topic is being discussed. Encourage them to talk about what they liked about their past teachers. \u0083 Stress the role of the American teacher as someone who will provide knowledge and directions, but will also guide students. \u0083 Most teachers are friendly and helpful. \u0083 Students should seek out teachers when they need help. If you have to ask a teacher a question, what can you do? If you do not understand what the teacher is saying, what can you do? \u0083 Review classroom rules about raising hands, and when to approach the teacher's desk. \u0083 Teachers can be approached after class, during recess or study hall, and after school, or a parent can write a note asking the teacher to meet with the student. \u0083 The Academic Coach, ESL teachers, and translators are also resources for the students. \u0083 Do not be afraid to ask teachers for help. Distribute two copies of Handout 8-2: Academic Coach Module 8 Getting Help 9\u0083 Assist students individually or as a group in completing the handout. Students should also write the information in their journals. \u0083 They are to take home Handout 8-2: Academic Coach home, show it to their parents, and post it in the house where it is visible. \u0083 They are then to get the parent's signature or mark on Handout 8-3: Parent Note and bring it back to the Academy the next day. Grades K-5, 6-8, 9- 12 (30 minutes) Show the videos Refugee Student Interviews and A Day in School (Elementary, Middle or High School) to reassure students that school personnel ar e available for information and support. Use the Guide to the Videos for introducing the video and for the follow-up discussion. ACTIVITY #2: VIDEOS Module 8 Getting Help 10 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: Students from the school district are invited to participate in the Refugee Academy. They can provide information to the new students and become a familiar face to the refugee students. The instructors can observe the class interaction to see possibilities for emerging friendships. The activities can further facilitate the development of new relationships. If mentors or \"buddies\" have been est ablished, they should meet with their assigned students. Ask guest students, one at a time, to: \u0083 Give their first name only. o Discuss the interpretation process. o All students will find the names of other students unusual and hard to pronounce. Point out that it works both ways. American students may have difficulty saying names of the refugee students, and vice versa. \u0083 Name one activity in school that they enjoy. \u0083 Name a favorite teacher and tell why. \u0083 Divide students into pairs or small groups, depending upon the availability of interpreters and instru ctors as facilitators. \u0083 Ask students to discuss the following questions, presenting one question at a time to the entire group. After each question is discussed, summarize the answers, stressing peers as positive resources. ACTIVITY #3: PEERS AS SUPPORT Module 8 Getting Help 11o How will students who speak English help students who are learning English? o Will American students laugh at students who do not speak English very well? If they do, what can be done? o What if a new student does not understand what is happening in class? o Are teachers nice? o What is the best thing about school? o How can you know if an American student will help a new student? o What if a student is mean to a new student? Although racism, teasing, and bullyi ng are sensitive topics, it is necessary to forewarn refugee students about the possibility that they will be treated badly by some students. Supportive peers can be extremely helpful when this topic is discussed. Ask them to describe treatment that should not be tolerated, how to handle it without making it worse, and who to turn to if the treatment is uncomfortable or becomes intolerable. o What if a new student knows t hat another new student needs help? o What is the most fun in school? \u0083 As a large group, ask the guest students to fill in the blanks: o In school, always remember _ . o In school, be alert for __ . o You will like American schools because __ . Module 8 Getting Help 12 JOURNAL TOPIC Grades K-5 Draw or write about who can help you in school. Grades 6-8 Draw or write about questions that you have about American schools, and how you will find the answers. Grades 9-12 Draw or write about people in the school who can help you, including students. SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES \u0083 Visit the office of the guidance counselor and other school personnel. \u0083 Organize games with guest students that involve informal communication, t eams, or projects. For example, cleaning up a playground, playing baseball, or participating in Project Adventure can help to connect students in the Academy with their new classmates. (Project Adventure Inc. is an outdoor trust-building physical education program. See www.PA.org). \u0083 Invite adults from the community who demonstrate support for refugee student s. Connect students with organizations and civic leaders who have been refugees themselves, or w ho are involved in programs that provide a safe haven for newcomers. \u0083 Introduce students to cro ssing guards, local shop owners, librarians, and other adults in the nearby Module 8 Getting Help 13community who can be a re source for the students. Take a walk around the neighborhood if students will be walking to school, and introduce the students to people who can help them if they need assistance. \u0083 If possible, invite classroom teachers to come to the Academy and introduce themselves. A familiar face can help immensely when a refugee student enters school for the first time. MODULE 9 STUDY SKILLS Module 9 Study Skills 2MODULE 9: Study Skills PURPOSE The purpose of Module 9 is to assist students in developing study skills. OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Learn basic strategies for developing study skills \u0083 Learn techniques for organization and concentration \u0083 Understand the significance of homework and strategies for completing homework successfully \u0083 Understand how to establish a home environment for successful studying SUPPLIES Handout 9-1: Homework School Supplies including: pencils, paper, notebooks, folders, binders, and other resources to assist students in getting organized Three file folders per student Sample plain or decorated cardboard boxes filled with school supplies (see Activity #2) Empty cardboard boxes large enough for school papers Supplies to decorate boxes including: wallpaper books, markers, colored paper, tape, glue, scissors, wrapping paper, paint Combination Lock Access to student lockers , if appropriate (see Activity #2) Piles of books and papers on table (see Activity #2) Optional: small spiral assignment notebooks for all students, or school- assigned notebooks Module 9 Study Skills 3MODULE 9: Study Skills VOCABULARY Elementary Vocabulary Secondary Vocabulary I think I can Concentrate* Ask Focus* Organization Pay Attention Locker/cubbies Where is it?

Study Study skills Plan Hard Easy Try *Advanced vocabulary often used by teachers Module 9 Study Skills 4 1. The keys to study skills are or ganization and time management. Even the most enthusiastic students may be come overwhelmed by the number of school assignments that have to be juggled. The purpose of Module 9 is to assist students in planning for multiple tasks. They will learn about basic study skills that will help them stay on track and meet deadlines. Before discussing study skills, determine how the Refugee Academy students will be assisted in completing classroom and homework assignments until they are comfortable with the English lan guage and can keep up with class work. The first concept that the student s of the Refugee Academy should learn is that there ar e \"study skills.\" Since many of the students will be adjusting to school for the first ti me in their lives, or at least adjusting to multiple classrooms and assignments, they may not know that there are systems to studying. Some of the strategies for developing basic study skills such as making sure supplies are handy, making lists of tasks to be acco mplished, and reviewing with a partner seem routine to most students, but can be new ideas for refugee students. They may not realize that they will be more successful if they study in shor t increments, rather than in one long session. They may not know that fatigue or emotions can impact on their ability to concentrate or that constant interruptions can result in mistakes. Instructors should explain to students that there ar e three items that will be essential in helping them stay organized and focused: an assignment notebook, a specific storage place for supplies and papers (at home and at school), and a school calendar. Show them how each of those items can affe ct time management and organization. Demonstrate how to fill out the assignment notebook. Show how a locker or cubby can be neat and accessible. Use a school calendar to show how due dates and reminder dates can be written in by the students. Instructors should also expl ain to students that teachers will have different methods of alerting students about assignments. Teachers may write homework on the chalkboard, they may pass out a syllabus at the beginning of the year, or they may announce assignments at the end of the class period. Most elementary teachers have a r outine system, but they still depend upon the students to keep track of their assignments. No matter what the teacher's system is, students should have one place to write down assignments. When they are given a due date that is days or weeks away, they should write down reminders in their assignment notebooks and on their school calendar. Writing it Key Points - Stud y Skills Module 9 Study Skills 5down in a notebook is the first essential step to managing the time it takes to complete assignments. The students should also be informed about the amount of time they could easily waste looking for textbooks, assignment sheet s, and supplies in thei r lockers, at home, and in their desks. Stress that one place at home an d one place at school should be designated for school resources. Point out t hat the one place should not be \"the locker\" but \"the red notebook in the locker.\" It should be recognized that many refugee students will not have a separate room or desk at home for their study materials. In Module 9 students have the chance to make a box that is designated ju st for them at home. It should contain their papers, assignments, textbooks, and supplies. It will have to be cleaned out routinely, but should at least provide a central location t hat will save them time when they start to work on their homework. It should also be noted that the concept of a calendar might be new. Take the time to show how the students can look at the dat e of assignments and connect to the dates on the calendar, writing down what is due. Reassure students that teachers in the English as a Second Language (ESL) classe s and Academic Coaches and translators will assist them in keeping track of their assignments. Some students may be enrolled in classes that are specifically designed for helping students in staying organized and getting their work done on time. 2. Plan ahead for studying at home. No matter where students live, they will be distracted when t hey try to study at home. They may have family members nearby, the te levision or radio on in the background, or headphones on with music playing loudly. Students should be informed that they should turn off any electronics and try to ignore the sounds around them , but the reality is that they will be easily tempted to turn on their favorite television show, or listen to music as they study. Adults are usually more uncomfortable with the distractions than the students themselves. Many of the students are used to lots of background nois e. Some students feel that they can study better if they are listening to music. Others cannot find a quiet place to study and can eas ily ignore the noise around them. Instructors should explain to students t hat they will learn best when they can concentrate on their work. They will also save time and get the work done more quickly if they can resist being distracted. Recognize that stud ents tend to prefer \"multitasking,\" for example, combining schoolwork while using electronic devices to listen to music and talking to friends by in stant messaging. Keep emphasizing that they will do better work if they concentr ate solely on the task at hand. Module 9 Study Skills 6Instructors can help students plan for how they will study at home. Without asking about specific living conditions, ask students for suggestions about where they can study. How can they set up study areas that are not distracting? Where can they keep school supplies so that they are readily avai lable? If home is partic ularly distracting, discuss different options such as the lo cal library, after-school study time, and community centers. Encourage students to use their home study time to get their assignments completed, and to think ahead to the next day. They should routinely ask themselves if anything is due the next day; can they get part of a project done that has a long-term deadline; or are there supplies they are supposed to take to school the next day? Study time should include preparing for the next day at school. 3. Teachers respect effort. Instructors should inform students that if they are struggling with an assignment or they did not have enough time to get it done, they should at least try to get some of it completed. Teachers respect students who put forth effort. In fact, some teachers would prefer that students at least attempt to do an assignment even if it is difficult. That way the teacher can see why the student is having difficulty and can help the student better understand the assignment. It is important to keep reinforcing that teac hers would rather see a serious attempt at work, rather than see no work at all. 4. Save time by following directions. The instructors should discuss the topics of directions and assignments with the English as a Second Language ( ESL) teachers to determine the best process for helping students who do not speak English. So much time is wasted when students cannot or do not follow directions. Instructors should in form students that they should not only write down assignments given by the teachers, but make sure that they understand what they are supposed to do. Encourage students to raise their hands and ask for clarific ation if they are not sure. Peers may be able to help them figure out what they are supposed to do for a class assignment or for homework. They can ask their ESL teacher s or approach the teacher after class and ask for clarification. Module 9 Study Skills 7 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5 (45 minutes) In this activity: Students will learn more about homework. They will discuss each item on Handout 9-1: Homework. For many students, the c oncept of homework will be a new one, and they will need specific guidance in how to prepare for studying at home. Distribute Handout 9-1: Homework. \u0083 Discuss each item, coloring as each is discussed. o Do not study in front of the television o Do not attempt to complete assi gnments in the morning before school o Plan on taking short breaks every 15 or 20 minutes, or if the work is too upsetting and frustrating. o The study area should be well lit, and, if possible, in an area with minimal disruption. o If possible, pick the same time every day to complete homework. o Some students like to tackle the har d assignments first and then quickly finish the easy assignments. Others like to get motivated by completing the easier assignments, leaving time to work on the harder ones. Remind students that they will make more mistakes if they are tired or hungry, and should plan to do their homewor k when they will be most alert. \u0083 Students in grades 3-5 can practice or ganizing multiple assignments. Explain that they have a series of homework assignments and ask them how they would go about organizing their study time. They may tackle the tasks in a different order. The emphasis should be on plann ing and prioritizing. Ask students how they will decide what to do first. Assignments might include: ACTIVITY #1: STUDYING AT HOME Module 9 Study Skills 8o Math worksheet o 20 minutes of reading o Diorama or other project Grades 6-8, 9-12 (60 minutes) Distribute Handout 9-1: Homework and ask the class what they think the pictures mean. Discussion Questions Why is it important to find a quiet place to study? \u0083 Recognize that it may not be possible for students to find a quiet study place at home. Suggest alternative study sites su ch as a local library or community center. Encourage students to inform family members about how important it is to be able to work without being interrupted. Some family members, especially younger siblings, will not under stand. Talk to the students about how to study without getting distracted. Can your family help you study at home? \u0083 Many family members will not speak English and will not know how to help the Refugee Academy students. Students can get help from their cla ssroom teachers, peers, ESL teachers, Academic Coaches, and translators. What will happen if you are successful in school? \u0083 Discuss the feeling of pride from doing anything well, and how family members would be proud of student success. Bu t also discuss the possible negative reactions to success, by people who may be j ealous or afraid of the results of the success. Encourage students to stay on task and work for achievement. \u0083 Some students may experience peer pressure to slack off or act out in class. Remind students that they will wa nt to feel pride in their work, resulting in a sense of confidence and achievement. Hard work can pay off when they pursue employment or higher education. This may seem obvious to the instructors, but many students, not just refugee students, do not understand the impact of schoolwork on their future. Give the student s examples of well-known, successful adults who believe that they succeeded because they worked hard in school. Module 9 Study Skills 9What if you can't concentrate or focus on your work? \u0083 Students should balance studying with a special activity or reward for hard work. Give examples of how students can br eak up the study time with a snack, exercise, or other activity befor e returning to their homework. \u0083 Procrastination can be a problem for a lot of students particularly with subjects that they do not enjoy. Procrastinati on can be battled by completing one step at a time. Discuss the importance of getting started on assignments that may seem hard or boring. Even if students just organize their papers, work one or two problems, or make an outline, they will di scover that they will be more motivated to continue the work because they have managed to get started on it. \u0083 Sometimes students are so stressed about their homework that they cannot concentrate and may get frustrated or upset. Module 14: Coping with Stress provides ideas about overcoming anxiety about schoolwork. Some tips include working on an assignment with a friend, family member or tutor; exercising every 10 minutes to break up the study time; es tablishing a reward chart for completion of phases of an assignment; and writing or drawing pictures about personal goals and how to achieve them. If you have a test on Friday, when should you start studying? \u0083 Before discussing this questi on, make sure that students understand what a \"test\" is and why teachers take them seriously. Module 10 Taking Tests addresses strategies that can be used to prepare for taking tests. \u0083 Discuss the importance of planning ahead and not \"cramming\" for an exam. Assignment notebooks should include times for studying well before the exam. \u0083 Encourage students to use Study Hall, study groups, ESL classes, and other opportunities to prepare for tests, in addi tion to individual review of study material. Ask students to explain how they would plan to study for: o A Math test every Friday o A Social Studies unit test o A test on a book discuss ed in English class. Remind students about teachers who can help them prepare for upcoming tests. Module 9 Study Skills 10 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: Students will prepare a storage box to keep at home. It will be a central location fo r their school assignments and supplies. The activity will also allow the students to work together to create a Study Box that appeals to them. Although this may seem like a craft project, encourage the students to start thinking about where they will keep the box so t hat it will not be disturbed, and how they will keep it organized. \u0083 Show students a plain cardboard box fi lled with schoolwork (pencils, notebooks, textbooks, homework). Tell them they are going to make a \"Study Box.\" \u0083 Show the students how they can decorat e the box so that it is their own personal home storage box for sc hool supplies and assignments. \u0083 Provide paints, stickers, glitter, colo red paper, markers, and other craft supplies. \u0083 If possible, provide assignment notebooks, file folders, pens, or other supplies to get the students st arted in filling their Study Boxes. Discussion Questions Where will you keep your Study Box at home? \u0083 Discuss how to keep the Study Box accessible yet away from other family members, pets, etc. \u0083 The Study Box should be kept in the same place so that it will be used routinely by the students. Suggest that they discuss the location with their family members. \u0083 The box can also be used as a communica tion tool for parents. The students can put assignments, notes from t he teacher, school announcements, and other ACTIVITY #2: GETTING ORGANIZED Module 9 Study Skills 11forms of communication in the box. T he family can go through the backpack and the box every night to see what is going on in school. For older students, a separate folder of school announcement s can be established to be shared with parents. What will be in the box? \u0083 Students should identify what should always be in the Study Box, such as pens, pencils, paper, calculator, etc. \u0083 The contents will change, but students should clean out the St udy Box routinely so that everything is up to date. \u0083 Students should keep teacher classroom rules and assignment sheets (or syllabi) in the Study Box for future reference. How will you organize the box? \u0083 Discuss various ways of organizing the box so that papers will not get lost. \u0083 Set a day of the week when t he Study Box will get cleaned out. How is the box different from your backpack? \u0083 Explain that the backpack is for st orage in school and transporting paperwork and textbooks. Assignments should either be in the locker, cubby or student's desk; in the backpack; or in the Study Box at home. How is the box different from your locker or cubby (or space assigned to the students)? \u0083 Discuss how the locker or cubby should be organized. \u0083 Discuss how students may not have access to their locker during the school day, and will have to plan when they can easily exchange books and papers in their lockers. The Study Box will contain papers and supplies that are needed for homework. \u0083 Many refugee students find lockers frustrating, when they should be a good resource for storing and organizing sc hoolwork. If it has not been done before, help students to practice using a locker co mbination. Practice storing items in the locker so that they can be found and removed easily. Is this a good storage system? \u0083 Show storage systems that ar e not effective, such as: o A coat with papers in pockets o A parent handout at the bottom of a backpack Module 9 Study Skills 12o A messy locker o An overflowing Study Box o Piles of books, papers on a table o Stuffed file folders o A blank calendar Module 9 Study Skills 13 Grades K-5 (60 minutes) In this activity: Students will have the opportunity to experience following directions. The instructors will point out how much time is saved when students follow directions closely. Instructors should also s how students how to record directions on paper so that they can be followed later. Emphasize resources for clarifying directions, such as peers, ESL teachers, Academic Coaches, and classroom teachers. \u0083 Ask the students to follow the instruct or's directions. Give simple tasks to complete in the room, gradual ly adding more and more tasks. \u0083 Tell the students that they are al lowed to ask for clarification. For example, ask one student to open a window, another to open the door, another to close the window, two others to sharpen pencils, and the entire cla ss to put their hands in the air. \u0083 Follow those directions with a series of directions that would require concentration. For example, ask the cl ass to stand up, walk around the room, pick up a textbook along the way, and then replace it wh en they reach the same spot again, while saying the words \"here we go\" as they are walking. \u0083 As the students are following directions, provide occasional distractions. After a few directions, speed up the process. \u0083 The purpose of the activity is to show students that they may receive many different directions at once in confusi ng circumstances. The exercise should be fun, so instructors should watch fo r students getting stressed or frustrated. ACTIVITY #3: FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS Module 9 Study Skills 14 Discussion Questions Was it hard to concentrate? \u0083 Discuss the impact of distractions and the pressure to s peed up when following directions. \u0083 Point out the importance of asking for clarification. \u0083 Discuss how difficult it may be at times to understand the directions and to get help with clarifications in time for completing an assignment. Encourage students to call peers after school, to e- mail teachers if they have access to teacher e-mail addresses, and to at least make the effort to try the assignment. Remind them that teachers appreciate initiative and effort and, as long as the student concentrates in class and writes down assignments, the teacher will assist students in completing work successfully. Module 9 Study Skills 15 JOURNAL TOPIC Grades K-5 Draw a picture of y our personal study area. Grades 6-8 Draw or write about your plans for studying at home and at school. Explain who you will go to if you need help with schoolwork. Grades 9-12 Draw or write about how you will or ganize your study time. What will you do if you don't understand something? SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES \u0083 Organize a school locker or cubby. \u0083 Purchase assignment notebooks on a field trip to a local store. \u0083 Practice combination locks. \u0083 Practice prioritizing sample assignments, especially at the secondary level. Ask students to think about why they would tackle one assignment earlier t han another, and how they can be prepared for a test by studying well in advance and the night before. \u0083 Teachers of English as a Second Language can discuss the role of ESL in helping students with organizing and completing schoolwork. \u0083 Help students to set up a fili ng system for multiple subjects. Provide file folders and markers. Students can learn the names of the subject areas an d establish file folders for \"homework,\" \"projects, \" and other assignments. Module 9 Study Skills 16 \u0083 Invite successful community members who have come to America from a variety of count ries to talk about how they adjusted to American schools. Ask them to emphasize the systems that they set up to stay organized, and how they managed to concentrate on schoolwork while adjusting to a new environment. If the adults st ruggled in adjusting, they should share what they would recommend for coping and adjusting, now that they look back at their experiences. \u0083 Discuss specific strategies for developing study skills that help students concentrate. For example, students can make flash cards, checklists, and practi ce tests. They can highlight notes, outline reading materi al, discuss possible test questions with peers, and study ol d exams. These and many other strategies may be new to the students, so include even the most basic approaches to help them study more effectively. Encourage ESL teachers to incorporate study skills in their lessons. \u0083 Instructors can use the activity Completing Assignments is Rewarding! Found in the Mini-Academy Curriculum on page 37. In this activity create a personal assignment notebook that will help them organize their studying. \u0083 The video A Day in School (Elementary, Middle or High School) shows students using school supplies in their classrooms. MODULE 10 TAKING TESTS Module 10 Taking Tests 2MODULE 10: Taking Tests PURPOSE The purpose of Module 10 is to prepare students for the process of test-taking in school. OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Understand the purpose of school assessments \u0083 Understand the methods of assessments in school \u0083 Learn techniques for test preparation and test-taking SUPPLIES Handout 10 - 1: Test Taking Handout 10 - 2: Practice Test Flash cards or photographs for True-False class quiz Sample tests Bubble sheet answer keys for all students Samples of district mid-term reports and report cards Gold stars and stickers Module 10 Taking Tests 3MODULE 10: Taking Tests VOCABULARY Elementary Vocabulary Secondary Vocabulary Test Quiz Questions Multiple Choice Bubble Sheet Answer Key Grade Score Placement *Letters a, b, c, d (for multiple choice test) Test Quiz Pop Quiz Grade Score Multiple Choice True-False Bubble Sheet Answer Key Essay Questions Placement Midterm Final Report Card *Letters a, b, c, d (for multiple choice test) Module 10 Taking Tests 4 1. Teachers give tests to determine student level of understanding of knowledge and skills. Before discussing tests with the students in the Refugee Academy, it is going to be necessary to explain the different types of tests that are given in American schools. All of these tests, or assessments, have similar formats such as multiple choice, essay, and true-false questions, but t he number of tests that occu r may be overwhelming to the students. In addition to standardized tests and classroom tests, there are quizzes, pop quizzes, exams , Regents exams, midterms, unit and chapter tests, and finals . There are also Advanced Placement tests, Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Tests (PSATs), Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SATs) and other tests t hat students can take if they are planning on going to college. More than likely, the re fugee students will also experience placement tests to determine grade and academic levels, and other forms of assessment to determine progress and academic gaps. It is not necessary to define every type of te st, but it is important to inform students about the purpose of the tests. Explain that teachers administer tests to determine what the students have learned and what el se needs to be taught. Reassure students that test results will not only identify topics that the students need to learn, but they will also reveal what the students already know. The students should be aware that during all types of tests they should refrain from talking to other student s, never copy answers from other students, and come prepared with the s upplies that are required, such as pencils, pens, and calculators. They should also know that some tests are timed and they may not be fi nished when the teacher instructs them to stop and put down their pencils. The Activities in Module 10 will assist the students in becoming familiar with the format of tests such as multiple choice, essay, or true-false questions , and will give them a chance to practice taking tests. 2. Teachers give some test s to determine placement. Most refugee students will have to take a series of tests to assess their knowledge and skills. Inform students that the tests will help the teachers discover what the students have learned prior to enrolling in American schools. The tests will also help the teachers plan for the educational program of the students. For example, a Key Points - Takin g Tests Module 10 Taking Tests 5student who is learning English may be skill ed in mathematics or may have excelled in science in their school in their native c ountry. Placement testing will help teachers determine their skill level and where to place them. Some of the students in the Refugee Academy will not be pleased with their placement. Academic Coaches can talk to the students, parents, and teachers to determine if the student has been placed properly, and can explain the rationale for the placement. 3. Start early to prepare for tests. Although there will be the occasional surprise test, students will usually be informed in advance that they are going to be tested on class material. Encourage studen ts to prepare for tests by studying well before the date of t he test. They should make notes in their assignment notebooks and calendars about upcoming tests, and should review sections of the study materials in advance. They may need assistance from a teacher in the English as a Second Language (ESL) progr am to prepare for tests. Explain to students that if they miss a test they will be abl e to take a \"makeup test,\" and if they do poorly on the te st, some teachers will allow them to study more and then take the test again. Emphasize that tests can be st ressful, but students will feel less anxious if they are prepared. If they keep up on their studies, ask for help when they start to get behind or confused, and work with teachers, tutors, and ESL teachers to prepare for tests, they will feel more confident and will increase their chances of doing well on the test. Module 10 Taking Tests 6 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5 (90 minutes) In this activity: Students will learn about t he different types of tests and the many aspects of taking tests. While reviewing the handout, discuss the difference between standardized tests and tests assigned by teachers. Explain t hat students will be required to take placement tests because they are new students and teachers need to assess skills and determine where to place the students. It may seem obvious, but the phrase \"D o your best\" cannot be said enough. Distribute Handout 10-1: Taking Tests and discuss each illustration, asking students if they have experienced taking a test. Explain the test-t aking process to students: \u0083 Students will sit at a desk or table and should not talk to anyone while taking the test. \u0083 They will need pencils, and ma y need a pen or a calculator. \u0083 Explain that \"cheating\" consists of sharing answers, copying from other students, bringing notes into the classroom, or stealing copies of the tests or answers before the exam. \u0083 Some tests are timed. Discu ss how to manage time when taking a test. \u0083 Explain how tests are graded. This di scussion may get complicated because some teachers have very elaborate gr ading systems. Provide the general background on percentage or letter grades . Scores on standardized tests will be discussed with the students and parents, and will be accompanied by written materials. ACTIVITY #1: TAKING TESTS Module 10 Taking Tests 7 Discussion Questions Because you are new to our school, we need to find out what you have learned before. Has anyone taken a t est at this school? What was it like? Can teachers help you when you take a test? What if you do not know the answ ers to the questions on the test? What if you are tired when you take the test? What if you have to go to th e rest room during a test? What if the student next to y ou knows the answers and you don't? What will the teacher do with the test when you are done? How can you prepare for a test so that you are not nervous when you take it? Discuss the true-false test . Explain the difference between something that is true and something that is false. \u0083 Hold up photos and ask a question about something in the photo that is clearly true or false. For example, show a picture of a bus and state, \"This bus has windows.\" \u0083 Ask the class to answer the question, saying TRUE or FALSE out loud. \u0083 Ask the students to each make a statem ent that is either true or false about something in the room. The answer should be obvious, although students may have difficulty at first. \u0083 Ask the class to answer the question, saying true or false out loud. Introduce the concept of multiple choice , including the letters a, b, and c. Using the same photos that were used in the true-fals e activity, ask questions with three possible answers, labeling the answers with a , b, and c. (A lesson on letter identification may be necessary, depending upon the age level of the students and their familiarity with the alphabet.) Module 10 Taking Tests 8 \u0083 Repeat each choice. Ask the students to select the correct answer. \u0083 This process will take time because it will require language comprehension (or waiting for a translator to rephrase t he question) and listening skills. Most tests are not given orally, so the purpose of the activity is to understand the concept of multiple choice, not to get the answer correct. \u0083 Continue the exercise unt il the class is comfortable with the concept of choosing an answer. Distribute bubble sheets and explain how they are filled out . Distribute pencils and practice filling out t he bubble answer keys. Do one step at a time, calling out lines to fill in and bubbles to color. Grades 6-8, 9-12 (90 minutes) Distribute Handout 10-1: Taking Tests and discuss each illustration, asking students if they have experienced taking a test. Explain the test-t aking process to students: \u0083 Students will sit at a desk or table and should not talk to anyone while taking the test. \u0083 They will need pencils, and may need a pen or a calculator. \u0083 Explain that \"cheating\" consists of sharing answers, copying from other students, bringing notes into the classroom, or stealing copies of the tests or answers before the exam. \u0083 Some tests are timed.

Provide the general background on percentage or letter gr ades. Scores on standardized tests will be discussed with the students and parents, and will be accompanied by written materials. For example: This bus has: (a) A cow on top of it (b) A roof on top of it (c) A banana on top of it Module 10 Taking Tests 9 Discussion Questions Because you are new to our school, we need to find out what you have learned before. Has anyone taken a t est at this school? What was it like? Can teachers help you when you take a test? What if you do not know the answ ers to the questions on the test?

Do one step at a time, calling out lines to fill in and bubbles to color. Review calendars for dates of midterms and exams , reviewing the terms. \u0083 Discuss examples of midterm reports and report cards. \u0083 Discuss studying for tests at home. For example: This bus has: (a) A cow on top of it (b) A roof on top of it (c) A banana on top of it Module 10 Taking Tests 11 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (30 minutes) In this activity: Students will have a chance to take a test, using the different formats discussed in Activity 1 . Handout 10-2: Practice Test consists of multiple choice, true-false, and fill-in-the-blank questions. Distribute Handout 10-2: Practice Test . \u0083 The instructors should determine whether the students should practice taking the test as a group, or whether they are ready to try it on their own. \u0083 Discuss how it feels to ta ke a test, and review the im portance of test preparation in reducing test anxiety. ACTIVITY #2: TAKING A TEST Module 10 Taking Tests 12 Grades K-5 (30 minutes) In this activity: Students will practice taking a test by reviewing vocabulary that has been introduced during the Refugee Academy. Since the purpose of the Activity is to assist students in understanding how to take tests, the tests used in the Ac tivity should not be graded. The students may want to talk about how they did on the tests, but do not point out the grades of individual students, and do not compare students. \u0083 Review vocabulary from previous M odules. Tell the students that you will be \"testing\" them after th e review. (The number of words will depend upon the class level of English comprehension and indications of test anxiety.) \u0083 Ask each student to answer a vocabular y question. For example, hold up a book and say, \"What is this?\" \u0083 Choose words and definitions that are easy to remember, used often, and very familiar to the students. The goal is to have every student get \"100\" on the test. \u0083 An alternative would be to ask students questions about study skills, or about preparing for the upcoming sc hool year. For example: o What are some of the supplies that you need for school? o Who is your Academic Coach? o Where will you store your papers and books? \u0083 Demonstrate test-preparation techniques (e.g., clues for re membering, reducing stress, quizzing by friends). \u0083 Divide the students into pairs to quiz each other. \u0083 Distribute stars, stickers, or other awards for getting answers correct. ACTIVITY #3: TEST PRACTICE Module 10 Taking Tests 13 JOURNAL TOPIC Grades K-5 Draw a picture of what you will do when you have a test to take in school. Grades 6-8 Draw or write about your plans for preparing for tests in school. Grades 9-12 Draw or write about your plans fo r preparing for tests in school. How will tests help you learn? SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES \u0083 Analyze completed report card s from other students (names should be blocked out). \u0083 Invite ESL teachers/guidance counselors to discuss test- taking, including protocols, placement, and cheating. \u0083 Give students the chance to correct tests that have been completed by the instructors. Discuss the process of grading tests and how scores are determined. \u0083 Provide students with the opport unity to take tests online. \u0083 Review samples of different ty pes of tests t hat students may experience once they are taking their classes. Gather tests from classroom teachers and show the students how the formats are generally the same. Explain to students that during the Academy they concentrate on the format of tests so that if they study content they will be pr epared to answer test questions in any format. \u0083 Invite ESL teachers to discuss essay questions with the students. Module 10 Taking Tests 14\u0083 Explain to students about the ro le of the New York State Regents examinations in high school graduation. Students who are enrolled in Regents-leve l courses may be required to purchase a Regents review book. They should be aware of the expectations of teachers in Regents classes, and the schedule of the exams. \u0083 Invite a specialist in study skills and test preparation to talk to the class about preparing for tests and overcoming test anxiety. \u0083 In the video Refugee Student Interviews refugee students talk about taking tests. Use the Guide to the Videos . MODULE 11 TECHNOLOGY AND SCHOOLS Module 11 Technology and School 2MODULE 11: Technology & School PURPOSE The purpose of Module 11 is to familiarize students with technology commonly used by students in American schools. OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Become familiar with technology available to all students \u0083 Understand computer security \u0083 Have opportunities to become familiar with the use of computers in the library and classroom \u0083 Become familiar with all types of technology commonly used by students SUPPLIES Examples of technology used by students and teachers (computer, laptop, iPAD, cell phone, iPOD, LCD projector) At least two computers for instructor communication Pre-selected Websites (games, interactive videos) Software programs , clip art, drawing, puzzles Software programs with languages of the Academy students Copies of School Technology Policy Local Hotline Numbers Video A Day in School Module 11 Technology and School 3MODULE 11: Technology and School VOCABULARY Elementary Vocabulary Secondary Vocabulary Computer Cell Phone Camera iPOD Print/Printer Bad/Danger DVD Camera Privacy Technology iPAD (or equivalent) Kindle (or equivalent) Computer Cell Phone Digital Camera iPOD Word Processing Print/Printer Security DVD Privacy Technology iPAD (or equivalent) Kindle (or equivalent) Cyberspace Cyberbullying Module 11 Technology and School 4 1. Technology is used routin ely by students and teachers. Undoubtedly the students in the Refugee Academy have bec ome aware of the use of technology by American students. Cell phones, laptops, personal digital assistants (PDAs), portable MP3 players, desktop computers, and other electronic devices are part of the daily routine for many students, at least in school. Not al l students can afford the latest \"gadgets,\" but they do see teacher s using different forms of technology in schools. Computers have become more mainstream in instruction, and students are oft en expected to be able to use the Internet and word process their assignments on a computer. In some schools, students have the opportunity to chart science expe riments and create publ ications on the computer. In math classes, they are required to be skilled at using a graphing calculator. The level of technology will vary considerably in each school, but most schools have computers in some of the cl assrooms, or at least in t he school library or computer center. In addition, public librar ies and local community centers may have computers that students can use after school. Students in the Refugee Academy will ne ed to know that computer skills are crucial in completing class assignments; conducting research; expanding knowledge about any subject, including current events and entertainment; and communicating locally and globally. Even if the technology resources are limited in the school, encourage students to seek out locations that have computers so that they can build their skills. 2. Computer skills will be cruc ial for completing class assignments, conducting research, and communicating locally and globally. For students who have not had the chance to s ee a computer, let alone learn how to use one, the technology can be exciting but inti midating. Reassure them that the initial steps in learning how to use a computer ma y be confusing, but they will learn quickly. They will need to know where they can access computers, and how they can get assistance in learning how to use them. The students may be required to complete assignments on a computer, but even if they are not, they will soon discover that computers can be essential in comp leting class assignments. It is important that the refugee students not only learn how to word process and access the Internet, they need to learn how to research effectively. They need ti me to explore useful Websites; Key Points - Technolo gy and School Module 11 Technology and School 5search for information on a vari ety of topics; experiment wit h tools that will assist them in learning English and completing assignm ents; and practice charting, drawing, and creating photos and illustrat ions on the computer. Computer technology is clearly going to be par t of their lives in the future, and it is important that they catch up as quickly as po ssible. How much students learn is up to them, but computer skills are the gateway not only to achievement of knowledge and expanded career options, but to social acceptance in school. In addition, students can also connect with t heir native countries by researching and presenting information about where they lived before coming to America. If possible, they can connect with other students in their native countries. They can show their classmates what they experienced in the past, and assist their new peers in learning about the world outside the classroom and neighborhoods. The students will also need to know about the security issues of computers, and how to protect their privacy and safety. While showing students the capabilities of computers, review the school policy on t he use of computers in school, and discuss the importance of security. Stress that students cannot determine from electronic communication such as e-mail, chat rooms, or instant messaging whether the contacts are who they say they are. Discuss how to be safe when using a computer, and how to report concerns. Instructors are well aware t hat their students, no matter w hat their backgrounds, are usually far more advanced than the adults in experimenting with technology. The Activities in Module 11 require instruct ors to demonstrate a va riety of electronic devices. If necessary, invite experts in technology, including students, to share information about the many uses of te chnology. Most important, determine how students in the Academy can access computers so that they can start learning about them as soon as possible. 3. Refugee students can be the victims of cyberbullying. Instructors should be aware that cyberbullying has becom e a significant concern, especially among middle and high schoolers. Some students do not hesitate to mock and tease other students by creating fake information, texts, and photos, and posting them on Facebook and other websites. The messages are often cruel. Because current technology allows messages to be qui ckly forwarded and disseminated (often worldwide), it is frequently difficult to st op or erase a negative me ssage. Cyberbullying can consist of nuisance phone calls, spr eading rumors, written texts (including \"sexting\"), modified photographs, e-mails, vi deos (such as those on YouTube), and comments on blogs and sites that are frequently used by students. Refugee students may be the subject of teas ing and harassment through cyberbullying. But they may also perpetuate a cyberbullyin g situation by joining other students in forwarding messages. In an effo rt to fit in, they may copy the negative behaviors, not fully comprehending the impact of cyberbullying. Module 11 Technology and School 6 Although the topic of bullying in general is discussed in M odule 15 - Staying Safe, it is important for technology safety to be discussed with refugee students. Activity #3 addresses the topic of cyberbullying. Instructors should st ress these points: Never open a message from an unknown person Never forward a text, e-mail, or other message that is critical of someone else Never create a message, photo, or website page that mocks, criticizes, insults, or threatens someone else (see Module 16 - Ha te Crime on the legal aspects of creating these messages) If a message that appears to be cyber bullying is received or witnessed cyberbullying, do not delete it and show it to an adult. Instructors can alert all adults who inte ract with refugee students that new refugee students are frequently the target of bullying. All complaints should be taken seriously, even if the bullying behaviors occur o ften and students appear to be \"just fooling around\" See Module 15 - Staying Safe for more information about the negative impact of bullying. NOTE: Implementation of the following activ ities will depend upon the availability of technology, knowledge of instructors, and school resources. Instructors will need to a rrange for students to be ab le to try out computers, or at least to be able to observe computers in use. Specialists in technology can be invi ted to display and demonstrate various types of technology, including different types of computers. Always emphasize security in the use of computers. Module 11 Technology and School 7 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (30 minutes) In this activity: Students will learn about a variet y of different types of technology. They will have the opportunity to see the capabilities of the electronic devices. Representatives from local technology stores or school-based instructional technology specialists ma y have to assist the instructors in carrying out the activities. While sharing information about technology, it is important fo r the instructors to keep emphasizing local access to computers, and safety and security when using computers. Inform students about how they can learn more about computers by enrolling in lo cal classes and taking the time to practice and experiment in the use of computers. Display a number of different types of technology, includi ng handheld electronic devices; desktop, laptop and notebook computers; and instructional resources such as LCD projectors, laser pointers, and so forth. Discussion Questions Do you know what any of these are? (This introductory question allows the instructor to assess the knowledge level of the students.) \u0083 Explain the uses of each example. ACTIVITY #1: AMERICAN STUDENTS AND TECHNOLOGY Module 11 Technology and School 8 Do you use any of these at home or at school? \u0083 Inform about access in the school and in the community. How much do these cost? \u0083 Discuss costs for electronic devices (inc luding peripherals) and alternative free access to technology. Is technology fun? \u0083 Point out the entertainment value of co mputers, even on educational Websites. Demonstrate games, pen pals, news reports , drawing programs, online videos, instant messaging, clip art, and Websites with content that would interest the students. \u0083 Show the students Websites about their native countries. Do you have privacy when you use any of these? \u0083 Warn students about blocking access to personal information, the weaknesses of information storage, and the negative uses of technology. \u0083 Discuss how they can protect themselves , and what to do if they feel that a contact is questionable. Module 11 Technology and School 9 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (120 minutes) In this activity: Students have the opportunity to learn more about different forms of technology that they may encounter during classroom activities. To ensure that students are familia r with the technology that is used routinely in schools and by their fellow classmates, select from one or more of the following activities. \u0083 Take digital photos of t he class, download and print. \u0083 Demonstrate pre-selected Websites for drawing, games, clip art, interactive movies, personal Web pages, etc. \u0083 Demonstrate e-mail and instant mess aging and pre-arrange opportunities for students to communicate with peers, fri ends, and relatives across the country, and other classes. \u0083 Connect students to pre-selected Websites for global pen pals, focusing on the native countries of the refugee students. \u0083 Demonstrate music players, showing ho w to legally download music and books. \u0083 Show a PowerPoint presentation. \u0083 Teach math problems using an LCD projector. \u0083 Visit a computer lab or school library computer center and provide basic instruction, pairing up Academy students or other classmates who are familiar with computers. \u0083 Take the class to an outside location, co ffee shop, or site w here laptops can be used. \u0083 Conduct a science lesson, using the co mputer to record and graph results. \u0083 Practice using a graphing calculator. \u0083 Demonstrate translation programs on the computer. \u0083 Demonstrate assistive technology for students with special needs. ACTIVITY #2: DEMONSTRATING TECHNOLOGY Module 11 Technology and School 10\u0083 Visit an electronics store and prearrange fo r demonstrations of various types of technology. \u0083 Visit video, television, or music studi os to show students how technology is used in the workplace. \u0083 Work with the students to create a Re fugee Academy newsletter with clip art illustrations and pictures of the student s. The text can be translated, using online translation programs. \u0083 Show students Websites that are in their native language. \u0083 Ask students from the sc hool to bring their handheld electronic devices and demonstrate how they use them every day . Discuss how much they cost, where they can be obtained, the pros and cons of different brands, and how to earn money to purchase them! \u0083 The video A Day in School (Elementary, Middle or High School) shows students working at computers, libraries with computer labs, and computers in classrooms. Module 11 Technology and School 11 Grades 6-8, 9-12 (30 minutes) In this activity: Students will be informed about cyberbullying and steps they can take to protect themselves from being targeted by bullies online and on the phone. Since students cannot always control t he actions of other students who bully anonymously using the Internet, refugee students should be reminded to tell a trusted adult if they are uncomfortable or upset after viewing a message or image on their computer or cell phone. Note: The instructor will need a la ptop, iPad, or cell phone to star t off this activity. At the end of the activity, the instruct or will show a picture of eit her the instructor smiling or a smiling face. This picture should be readily accessible on the electronic device being used. The instructor should open up a laptop, iP ad or cell phone in front of the class and pretend to be very interested in what they are viewing. The instructor can laugh, read, and click a few buttons, conti nuing to show interest until the class notices and expresses curiosity. (Not e: It doesn't really matter what the instructor is looking at, and the st udents should not be allowed to peek.) The instructor should suddenly look ala rmed, shocked, then upset - and slam the computer shut or turn off the phone. The instructor should announce: I just saw something on the Intern et that really hurt my feelings! I don't know how it got there. I don't know who did it! Before the students become too concer ned, the Instructor should say: I was just pretending, but what if it were true? Does that ever happen? Although many refugee students may not be familiar enough with computers, be prepared for students to s hare stories about what they have heard or experienced. Some refugees who are not at all familiar with technology may not comprehend the misuse of computers. ACTIVITY #3: CYBERBULLYING Module 11 Technology and School 12 The instructor should explain that sometimes students tease and insult other students by using a computer or cell phone. They may show pictures or videos, or write messages that are mean. They may think that is funny, but: It is wrong. It can hurt feelings. It is called cyber bullying (cyber means \"invol ving computers or computer networks\") It is not allowed and can even be against the law. Ask students what they should do if they see something on the computer or cell phone that is mean - even if it is not about them per sonally. Reinforce the following: \u0083 Never open or respond to messages from cyberbullies \u0083 Tell a trusted adult (di scuss who that might be) \u0083 Never open or respond to messages from cyberbullies \u0083 Save the messages so adults can see exactly what was said (and perhaps figure out who sent it) \u0083 If they are with other students who are cyberbullying, do not participate. Try to start another acti vity to distract them. If that doesn't work, leave the situation. The Instructor should open the laptop (i Pad or cell phone) again, and carry out the same dramatic reactions. This time the instructor should not close the laptop and ask the students: Oh no! There is something on my l aptop that hurts my feelings! What should I do? Discuss what students should do, reviewi ng the steps (do not respond, save the message, do not join in, and tell an adult). Review the terms: stranger online Facebook chat room privacy website cyberbullying password The Instructor should tell the students that the answer to the following questions is \"NO\". They should say \"NO\" every time. Note that many students may be used to rote responses to teachers. Although this is a serious topic, the students should be enjoying this exercise while ge tting the point. The instructor should make sure they understand every point that is made. Simply saying \"NO\" will not ensure comprehension of the messages. Stop and discuss. Ask: Should you give your real name to someone on the computer if you don't know them? Should you ever give your addre ss or phone number to anyone online? Module 11 Technology and School 13If someone calls you a bad name online, should you write back? Should you call them a name? If they do say bad things about you, shoul d you pretend it didn't happen? If someone says something about you that is n't true, should you write the truth? Find the person and fight them? Should you ever share your passwords with anyone else besides your parents or guardian? Should you ever give away credit card numbers online unless you have permission from your pa rents or guardian? If you are feeling sad or lonely, should y ou tell someone in a chat room all about yourself? Are all of the people who talk to you on the Internet the same age as you? Are they all your friends, even if they are nice to you? The Instructor should congratulate the students on being smart about technology. Remind them of what was just discu ssed and review the points again. Then tell the students to say \"YES\" to the following questions: \u0083 If you see something online t hat makes you uncomfortable and upset, will you go to an adult for help? \u0083 If someone asks you for help online - even if they are from your home country - should you ask an adult to help you? \u0083 If you are sad or lonely, will you talk to a real adult about it, not a stranger online? (Note that there are hundr eds of chat rooms just for teens. They are often visited by adults who pose as teens. Explain to students that the Internet is a valuable resource for information about a problem. If they cannot find an adul t to talk to, they can find a hotline number online to call. A real person will answer and help them. If possible, provide loca l hotline numbers for suicide prevention, domestic abuse, and ot her problems that require adult intervention.) \u0083 Will you enjoy using technology, but be very careful and safe? Congratulate the students again. If possibl e, the screen of t he laptop, iPad, or cell phone can be shown to the class. It should have a picture of the instructor smiling or a big smiley face. Module 11 Technology and School 14 JOURNAL TOPIC Grades K-5 Draw or write about plans for using the computer. Grades 6-8 Draw or write about concerns about computers and how you expect to learn how to use them or how you will use them for schoolwork. Grades 9-12 Draw or write about how you will us e computers in your schoolwork, and how you expect to become comfor table with the us e of computers and other technology. SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES \u0083 Discuss computer security, covering topics such as: o Sharing personal information o Internet scams o Inappropriate/unsafe sites o Spam o Shutting down the computer o Theft \u0083 Review the school policy on computers. \u0083 Demonstrate technology used in English as a Second Language (ESL) programs. \u0083 Tour the schools to identify the location of computers and discuss the schedule and the rules for using them. \u0083 Visit the public library and ask the librarians to explain the use of the computers after school. MODULE 12 SCHOOL SAFETY AND SECURITY Module 12 School Safety 2MODULE 12: School Safety and Security PURPOSE The purpose of Module 12 is to inform students about strategies for staying safe in school and in their communities. OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Become familiar with school safety \u0083 Understand school policies about safety and security \u0083 Learn strategies for self- protection SUPPLIES Handout 12 - 1: Zero Tolerance School Law Enforcement official guest speaker Prepare for a fire drill Video A Day in School (Elementary, Middle or High School Module 12 School Safety 3MODULE 12: School Safety and Security VOCABULARY Elementary Vocabulary Secondary Vocabulary Fire Safety Dangerous Fire Drill Lockdown Neighborhood Emergency Bothering No Help Police Firefighter Evacuate Zero Tolerance Fire Gun Weapon Knife Cigarettes Alcohol Graffiti \"Against the Law\" Police Officer Firefighter Safety Security Dangerous Fire Drill Lockdown Emergency Bothering No Help Evacuate Module 12 School Safety 4 1. School is a safe place . Module 12 focuses on basic safety issues in school, such as fire drills and \"Zero Tolerance\" policies. The topic of school safety is a difficult one to discuss with students. They need to be reassured that school is a safe place, but they may be witnessing activities that make t hem uncomfortable or fearful, and they may be experiencing treatment that does not make them feel very safe. Throughout Module 12 it is impor tant for the instructors to concentrate on the positive aspects of school safety. Emphasize what students can do to stay safe and who they can turn to for assistance. Instructors can start by explaining that school administrators establish systems for keeping students and employees safe. Some schools may have metal detectors, locker searches, resident police officers , and \"lockdown\" drills. Others may have policies and disciplinary procedures in plac e. They are all designed to keep students safe. Reassure students the adults in unifo rms are in the building to help them and keep them safe. Their past experiences may make them wary and afraid. The students may have heard about or witnessed incidents in schools that would lead them to believe that American schools ar e unsafe. Emphasize that the incidents are rare. School personnel and law enforcement officials are paying close attention to possible safety concerns, and work hard ever y day to make schools safe and secure. For many new students, t he topic of safety can include the subject of gangs. Instructors may decide that the topic is relevant to the students in the Refugee Academy, and an expert in the topic should come to the Academy and talk to the student s. There are community leaders, law enforcement officials, and couns elors who are well versed in the subject and can provide the students with crucial information about avoiding gangs. Module 12 does not address the topic of bully ing and gangs in detail, because they are specific to each school and require instruction by experts. However, if the instructors of the Refugee Academy feel that students may be significantly impacted by gang activity in the neighborhoods of the sch ools, the subject must be addressed. Explain to the students that joining a gang may feel like being part of a \"family\" , but there are more positive alternatives. Invite experts on gang activity to visit the Academy and talk directly to the students. Alert students to me thods that are used to recruit students into gangs, and how to handle pressures to join a gang. Above all, encourage the students in the Refugee Academy to discuss their concerns about gangs with the Academic Coaches. Key Points - School Safet y Module 12 School Safety 5 2. Refugee students may be teased and bullied . Refugee students may be treated poorly by some students in school. It is necessary to warn the students in the Academy about this possi bility, if they have not experienced it already. Explain the possible reasons for th e teasing and bullying. Emphasize that only a few students will participate (more than likely with a group surrounding them for support) and they do not reflect the attitude of the ent ire school body. Not all refugee students will be teased or bullied, but it is possible that they will be treated poorly, and it should be discussed. Acknowledge that whenever students are \"different\" in the way that they speak, look, dress, or behave, they may be subject to teasing from their peer s. Although they never deserve it and it should never be condoned, the refugee students can learn strategies for protecting themselves. The strategies vary from changing a schedule for walking home from school, gathering with friends, keeping valuables in a safe place and not at school, and developing humorous responses that indicate that the teasing is ineffective. Talk about the significance of ignoring stude nts who are teasing. Walking away and not responding can be a more powerful message than engaging. As one student explained when discussing her first few weeks in an American school, \"I learned how to turn my back on the kids who were mean, and turn toward the kids who were nice to me.\" The students should be aware that if their learning is being disrupted by a student or group of students who are bullying or harassing, they need to report their concerns so that th ey can focus on the purpose of school. They may be hesitant to tell, but thei r personal safety may be at stake, and they may have difficulty concentrati ng on their studies. Point out that if a bully manages to disrupt the educ ation of a refugee student, then the bully has \"won.\" Refugee students can succeed if they are not worrying about how they will be treated. There are a number of resource materials for instructors on bullying and harassment in school. If the instructors of the Refugee Academy determine that the students may be victims of bullying, then it is essential that the topic be discussed openly and honestly so that students are prepared. 3. School rules, especially \"Zero Tolerance\" rules must be followed for school safety and security . Instructors should review school policies about safety and security and stress the importance of following the rules. Activi ty #4, to be used with middle and high school students, discusses Zero Tolerance policies in detail. Module 12 School Safety 6 Students in the Refugee Academy ma y see other students ignoring the rules, or erratic enforcement of the rules. T he rules may be different than in their native countries, and they may have trouble adjusting to them. Remind students that adm inistrators and teachers are always paying attention to safety issues. If they see a note with a dangerous message, it is not regarded as a joke, even if it was intended as such. If they hear a threat, witness suspicious behavior, or are told disconcerting information by a student, they take it seriously. They will check lockers, backpacks, coat pockets , and handbags if they are concerned about the safety of their students. Stress to the students that they need to take the Zero Tolerance rules seriously and obey them at all times. Module 15: Staying Safe addresses the topics of bullying, drugs and alcohol and gangs, and how students can avoid becoming involved in unhealthy and harmful activities. Module 12 School Safety 7 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9- 12 (90 minutes) In this activity: Students will practice exiting t he school for a fire drill, and will learn what to do during a lockdown. Many refugee students will be frightened by fire drill alarms. The sound of the al arm may trigger terrible memories. They may be accust omed to hiding inside when there is an alarm, ra ther than going outside. Talk about emergencies and why the alarm may ring. Explain that there are drills throughout the school year to prepare for the extremely rare possibility that there might be a fire or need for a lockdown. Before ringing the fire alarm, expl ain that the class is going to talk about emergencies. Discussion Questions What does \"emergency\" mean? \u0083 Define \"emergency,\" then explain system s for handling emergencies in schools. \u0083 Describe the sound of fire alarms, and the different codes for lockdown. Explain when drills may occur and what students should do when there is a drill. Who can help you in an emergency? \u0083 Explain that students may fear alarms , police in uniforms and the sounds of sirens, but they should be interpreted as indications of help on the way. \u0083 Discuss how to call 911 and when a 911 call should be made. \u0083 Practice asking for help in English ACTIVITY #1: PREPARE FOR EMERGENCIES Module 12 School Safety 8 What if there is a fire in school? \u0083 Explain the exit systems. \u0083 Practice fire drill procedures, including exit ing from the cafeteria, halls, gym, and other classrooms. \u0083 Take attendance at each drill so that students know the procedure. What if the teachers want you to stay in y our room to be safe, or what if they tell the class to evacuate? \u0083 The instructors will have to determine how much they want to discuss \"bomb scares,\" evacuations, and the reasons fo r school lockdowns. The students will undoubtedly hear about these issues, but it may be necessary to address them in general terms, depending upon the age and background experiences of the students in the Academy. The subject c an be very upsetting to some refugee students, but necessary to at least discu ss so that they ar e prepared should an evacuation or lockdown occur. Without goi ng into details, explain that students will be told what to do by their teachers. Why do we practice for something that will probably never happen? \u0083 Explain to students that it is important to know why an alarm is ringing and what they are supposed to do. A sudden alarm can cause unpredictable responses in refugee students, including flashbacks, anxiety, fear, and confusion. By practicing, the students can becom e familiar with the routine. \u0083 Explain to students that they should lis ten to adults and follow exactly what they are told to do. If they are confused, they can ask a classmate to guide them. What if there is an emergency at home or in your neighborhood? \u0083 Explain to students how to call 911 and have them practice asking for help. \u0083 If students are in an emergen cy situation, they may need a translator. Practice what they can say to request a translator. Module 12 School Safety 9 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9- 12 (45 minutes) Show the video A Day in School (Elementary, Middle or High School). Use the Guide to the Videos for introducing the videos and for follow- up discussion. ACTIVITY #2: BE SAFE Module 12 School Safety 10 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: Students will learn about who can help them when they do not feel safe. Activities related to safety and security may give students the impression that they should alwa ys be afraid for their safety. Stress throughout this activity that students just need to be prepared. The chances are slim that there will be an actual emergency, and adults stand ready to help them. Point out that students can avoid emergenc ies if they play safe, obey school policies and procedures, and report concerns to parents, school officials, or law enforcement. Remind students that they are protecting their peers if they tell adults that they have heard or witnessed something that makes them concerned or suspicious. Peer pressure and fear of reprisals will make them hesitate to te ll. Reassure them that schools strive for confidentiality and many districts have established confidential hot lines, but even if it is not possible to keep the source completely confidential, students need to ta lk to a trusted adult if the well-being of others is at stake. Discussion Questions Who will you tell if you see dangerous activity, an accident, or a fire? Who will you tell if you see someone hurting another person? ACTIVITY #3: WHO CAN HELP? Module 12 School Safety 11Who will you tell if someone is bothering you? (Grades 6-12) Who will you tell if you see something suspicious? (Define suspicious.) What if you are afraid to tell? Module 12 School Safety 12 Grades 6-8, 9-12 (30 minutes) In this activity: Students will discuss the specifics of rules of Zero Tolerance in schools. As the topic is discussed, the instructors should provide students with different ways to resist peers who may try to get them to break the Zero Tolerance rules. Distribute Handout 12-1: Zero Tolerance . Discuss: \u0083 The definition of the ph rase \"zero tolerance\" \u0083 Each item on the handout \u0083 Reporting concerns \u0083 Reluctance to report and the importance of telling an adult \u0083 Student rights if t here is a problem \u0083 Translators, coaches, advocates who are resources in emergencies \u0083 Drugs and alcohol on the school campus and in the community; New York State laws about drug and alcohol use and consumption \u0083 School suspension policies, including suspension from athletic teams \u0083 School records and employment and college applications \u0083 Law enforcement personnel in school and as a resource for students and their families ACTIVITY #4: ZERO TOLERANCE Module 12 School Safety 13 JOURNAL TOPIC Grades K-5 Draw a picture or write about how you would help someone who needed your help. Then draw or write about what you would do if you needed help. Grades 6-8 Draw or write about how you woul d respond if someone was bothering you or pressuring you to do someth ing you didn't want to do. How do you choose the right friends? Grades 9-12 Draw or write about how exactly you would resist something that you knew was against school rules and agai nst the law, but you didn't want to lose your friends who were pressuring you. How do you choose the right friends? SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES \u0083 Tour police and fire stations. \u0083 Tour schools to discuss evacuation. \u0083 Invite instructors in self- defense to talk to the Academy students about basic methods of protecting themselves. (This should be done if it is possibl e that students will be physically bullied on the way to school, or if they need to develop assertiveness skills to better protect themselves.) \u0083 Invite a school counselor to facilitate discussion about worries, flashbacks, and past ex periences with danger, with the intention of reassuring st udents that schools are safe environments. \u0083 Invite the school police office and hall monitors to meet the students. \u0083 Invite experts to talk to the students about gangs. (See Key Point 1.) MODULE 13 KEEPING FAMILIES INFORMED Module 13 Keeping Families Informed 1MODULE 13: Keeping Families Informed PURPOSE The purpose of Module 13 is to inform students about the importance of school-home communication. OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Identify ways to keep families informed of school events \u0083 Understand the purpose of keeping families informed about academic progress \u0083 Understand methods of keeping the school informed about events at home and personal concerns that affect success at school \u0083 Understand the role of the school nurse-teacher ; SUPPLIES Handout 13 - 1: School-Home Communication Handout 13 - 2: School Events School Nurse- Teacher supply box : lunch card, mittens, gloves (optional: one pair of gloves per student); medicines stored in nurse's office (aspirin, asthma medicine, etc); thermometer, tongue depressor, Band-Aid, jacket, hat, boots, crutches, soap, towel) Sample announcements Announcements to be delivered over the public address system Videos: Refugee Student Interviews , Refugee Parent Interviews , and A Day in School (Elementary, Middle or High School) Module 13 Keeping Families Informed 2MODULE 13: Keeping Families Informed VOCABULARY Elementary Vocabulary Secondary Vocabulary Lunch Card Free Lunch Permission Announcements School Nurse Boots Soap Washcloth Jacket Hat Gloves Lunch Card Free Lunch Permission PA System Announcements Newspaper Communication Heat Housing School Nurse Thermometer Band-Aid Crutches Soap Washcloth Jacket Hat Gloves Boots Module 13 Keeping Families Informed 3 1. Schools inform students about sc hool events in many ways; it is also the responsibility of st udents to inform families. Prior to discussing school-home communication with the students in the Refugee Academy, the instructors should determine w hat methods the schools use to inform parents about school policies and events. Methods may include: \u0083 Flyers and notices for students to take home (or to be mailed home) \u0083 Newsletters, either mailed to homes or posted on a school district Website \u0083 Field trip announcements and permission slips \u0083 Letters from the principal or school district \u0083 School newspapers and local newspapers \u0083 Parent-teacher conferences \u0083 Open House and other ev ening programs for parents \u0083 Education Week, which may include tours and classroom visits \u0083 Academic Coach meetings and phone calls \u0083 Public address system announcements for students \u0083 Homeroom teacher announcements Inform students that school administrator s and teachers keep information flowing to parents, but the students have to participate in the process. They should bring notices home, write down events in their school calendars, and keep parents informed about upcoming school events. It is well known that most school notices end up in the bottom of a backpack or locker, or on the floor of the school bus. Since sch ools have annual calendars, explain to students that they should review the cal endar with their parent s and highlight events that parents may want to attend. Key Points - Kee ping Families Informed Module 13 Keeping Families Informed 4 2. Monitoring academic progress is the responsibility of the school, family, and student. Students should also keep their parent s informed about their academic progress, but if they do not, ther e are phone calls from teachers, interim reports, graded papers, parent-teacher conferences, and report cards that all indicate how t he students are doing in school. Instructors should describe these methods of communication to the students, explaining that parent s will be informed that they can call teachers anytime for an update on student progress. Parents w ill also be given information about the dates of report cards. Interi m reports, usually sent halfway through a marking period or after a midterm exam, ar e typically sent in the mail to parents. Suggest to students that if they are concer ned about their progre ss or grades, they should talk to the teacher to try to figure out how to improve the situation. Even if the teacher still feel s that the parents should be in volved, the students will have demonstrated interest in getting help from the teacher. Remind st udents that teachers appreciate effort, not just achievement. 3. Communication between schools a nd families can be limited due to language barriers; resources are available. The students are going to be the key to co mmunication when family members do not speak English. Inform the st udents that they will be responsible for explaining school- related information to their par ents. If they need assistance, they can consult with their Academic Coach, English as a Second Language (ESL) instructor, translator, guidance counselor, or classroom teachers. It is a big responsibility for student s to try to adjus t to their new school, learn a new language, make new friends, and also keep their families informed. Family members may be overwhelmed and distracted with adapting to their new lives and looking out for the welfare of the family. It is especially difficult if t he students themselves are bewildered about school. They may be embarrassed by their parents, or feel pressure from their parents to either adapt to thei r new life, or resist changing cultural traditions. The students, often at a young age, are being pu lled in many different directions. Module 13 Keeping Families Informed 5 4. Students who are worried about i ssues at home can confide in school personnel so that their academic progress is not jeopardized. For many students, as they become more fl uent in English and more comfortable in the school, it is frustrating to keep parents informed. As students move into middle and high schools, they tend to want to keep their private business to themselves. Encourage students to share info rmation about their life at school so that parents will know how they are doing and can support them. If students are st ruggling and having difficulties (academically or persona lly) they should talk to a trusted adult, who will determine if the par ents need to get involved. In addition to the Academic Coach or teacher, the students may want to talk to a guidance counselor, peer who will get advice from an adult, community agency staff in the nei ghborhood, religious leader, or the school nurse. The school social worker can help students with problems at home, including issues related to food and heat, transportation, clothing, housing, baby supplies, and safety concerns. Refugee students will not only have to be told many times that help is available. They may not realize that there are state and lo cal agencies that can make sure they have enough food, and can ensure that they will have heat in the winter and milk for younger siblings. Most of the student s in the Academy are accustomed to doing without even the basics. To them, speaking up about such luxuries as housing and clothing does not occur to them. Provide the students wit h flyers, phone numbers, and brochures (usually provided by state agencies in many languages) that describe programs related to food stamps, public assistance, homeowner loans, and so forth. The students may experience attitudes on the part of their new neighbors and classmates that are not welcom ing to refugees in America. They may be told that they should not accept a \"handout\" and s hould make it on their own. They may also be told that they can go \"f rom rags to riches\" and follow the \"American dream\" in their new country. This may be tr ue, but for most refugee students and their families, there will be daily struggles to adjust and be successful in getting food on the table. The students may want to work hard in school, but they will be trying to cope with some of the frustrations that are occurring at home. They may see their parents encountering discriminati on and hardships that t hey did not expect. Inform the students in the Re fugee Academy that t here are many adults (and peers) in the school who will listen to t hem and help them. If they are aware of available services and understand that they are expected to take advantage of them so that they can be successful in their new country, they will f eel more comfortable approaching adults in the school for help. Module 13 Keeping Families Informed 6 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: The school nurse-teacher shoul d be invited to the Refugee Academy to discuss assistance that can be provided by the nurse's office. \u0083 Prepare a box that contains items that represent how the school nurse can help students. \u0083 One by one, take items out of a box to demonstrate types of assistance. Stress confidentiality and privacy . o Show a lunch card and describe how to enroll in the free lunch program. o Show clothing, (including hats, gloves, and mittens) that has been donated to refugee students. o Show medicines and explain school requirements about storing medicines in the nurse's office. o Show a phone and tell how the nurse will use it to call parents if a child is sick; t he food pantry if a family needs food; and local agencies if a family needs housing, transportation or other services. S how how the nurse will call 911 in emergencies. o Show a thermometer, tongue depressor, and stethoscope, used for sick visits and physical. o Show a Band-Aid and put one on each student to demonstrate how the nurse will assist with cuts and other minor health problems in school. o Show crutches and a sling. o Show soap, a washcloth, and toothpaste to indicate that the nurse will help with hygiene. ACTIVITY #1: KNOW YOUR SCHOOL NURSE -TEACHER Module 13 Keeping Families Informed 7 Discuss: \u0083 How to get to the nurse if student is supposed to be in class \u0083 How the nurse will provide counseling about health concerns \u0083 Personal privacy during examinations \u0083 Respect for cultural traditions \u0083 How to explain problems to the nurse o Translator o Use of body language and gestures o Drawing pictures o Bilingual peers \u0083 When the nurse's office will call families \u0083 Frequent visits to the nurse o Possible health reasons o Stress o Getting out of class Grades 6-12 also discuss: \u0083 Confidentiality rules about health concerns (NYS HIPAA law) \u0083 Sex education resources (health class, nurse) \u0083 Confidentiality rules about sexually trans mitted diseases and other related health concerns (pregnancy, menstr ual cycle, HIV-AIDS, etc.) \u0083 Personal health and possible causes of health problems o Current and past diets, including malnutrition o Stress o Lack of health care Module 13 Keeping Families Informed 8 o Need for immunizations o Disabilities, either diagnosed or undetected For all topics of discussion, point out that the school nurse will be busy, but will find the time to talk to students if they indicate that they would like to talk to someone. Explain to students how to approach the nurse (or nurse' s aide) and how to bring up sensitive subjects. Module 13 Keeping Families Informed 9 Grades K-5 (30 minutes) In this activity: Students will discuss the many diffe rent ways that schools will communicate with parents. Instructors should discuss how parents will be informed by the school about events and student pr ogress, but that the students are also responsible for informing their families about school-related activities. Distribute Handout 13-1: School-H ome Communication and Handout 13-2: School Events and discuss the many different ways that schools will communicate with parents. (The students may want to color the handouts.) \u0083 The pictures depict: o The nurse calls home when a child is sick. o Parents can call the school anytime. o Teachers call home to talk to parents. o Schools send home informa tion with the students. o Schools mail information to homes. o Announcements are made ev ery morning in school. o Parents can check schoolwork and report cards. o Parents can help with homework. o Teachers may send e-mail. ACTIVITY #2: SCHOOL - HOME COMMUNICATION Module 13 Keeping Families Informed 10 \u0083 Discuss the types of events families will want to know about. (Go over each item on Handout 13-2: School Events ) o School play o Science fair o PTA/PTO meetings o Sports o Music concerts o Awards o Graduation o Book fairs/art shows o Parent-teacher conferences Ask students to take Handouts 13-1 and 13-2 home to their families to discuss. This is their homework. Explain that students will have to keep fa milies informed if they are non-English-speaking, and that parents can attend school ev ents if they do not speak English. Discussion Questions Who will you share the handout with at home? Who will you tell about school events? How will family members get to th e school for events and conferences? Can students come to school events with family members? What after-school events can family members attend? Do your parents need to understand English to attend school events?Module 13 Keeping Families Informed 11 Grades 6-12 also discuss: What if your family members do not act the way you would like them to act when they visit your school? What if you are concerned that your pare nts will not approve of your progress in school? Who can you talk to if your parents can not provide support to you as you adjust to school? Follow up by asking students if they shared the handouts with families, checking off the homework assignment.

MODULE 14 COPING WITH STRESS Module 14 Coping with Stress 1MODULE 14: Coping with Stress PURPOSE The purpose of Module 14 is to assist students in developing strategies to cope with stress. OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Understand the signals of stress \u0083 Understand the causes of stress \u0083 Understand and apply coping strategies \u0083 Understand that school personnel and Academic Coaches are available to assist students in coping with stress SUPPLIES Handout 14 - 1: Show How You Feel Examples of hobbies: jigsaw puzzles; stamps; collections 3 x 5 cards Funny Video A dozen silly jokes (see Activity #1 and check with translators) Video: Refugee Student Interviews Module 14 Coping with Stress 2MODULE 14: Coping with Stress VOCABULARY Elementary Vocabulary Secondary Vocabulary Nervous Stress Relax Worry Tease Cry Write Confide Nervous Stress Relax Worry Harass Cope Patience Tease Cry Write Confide Trust Reaction Module 14 Coping with Stress 3 1. Stress is defined as tension in the body or mind and is an automatic reaction to anxi ety, fear, or danger. Module 14 is included in the Refugee Academy because it is stressful for students of any age, under any circumstances, to be new in school. Add on the major adjustments that have to be made when refugee students have to adapt to a new country and a new school. They have to learn a new language, cope with pas t experiences and changes in family structure and responsibilities, and achieve academically. The first thing the students will need to know is that it is normal to feel nervous and anxious as they prepare to enter their new school. Define stress and reassure them that everyone feels stress at one time or another. Some days will be more stressful than others, and students will cope differently, but they should not be alarmed if they feel a combination of excitement and nervous tension. One of the purposes of the Refugee Academy is to ease t he stress of the students and help them feel relaxed and prepared for school. Many of the students will feel disoriented. Everything will be ne w to them, including foods, language, traffic, clothing routines, and the way that students behave in school. The purpose of Module 14 is to provide the students with tips about how to i dentify and handle stress, and what to do if they are feeling anxious and afraid. The signals of stress will vary with student s, but they generally emerge as opposite behaviors: withdrawing or acting out. So me students will feel depressed and will become quiet and withdrawn. They may lose inte rest in eating or socializing, may not be able to sleep, and may suffer from physi cal ailments such as stomachaches and headaches. They may try to hide physical disabilities and may be experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental health problems. Other students may try to mask thei r anxiety by acting overconfident, drawing attention to themselves by being loud and rude, or silly and inattentive in class. They may lose their temper or tease and bully other students. They may join groups that br eak school rules or break the law. Adults who experience stress may show it by losing patience quickly, becoming defensive or aggressive, complaining, or crying. Children may demonstrate similar behaviors, but adults may not re cognize that the children are stressed. They may see the child as a discipline probl em with a \"bad attitude.\" The instructors should reassure the students that teac hers, guidance counselors, and Ac ademic Coaches are aware of the stress of refugee students, will recognize the symptoms of stress, and are available to help them as they cope wit h adjusting to a new life. Key Points - Co ping with Stress Module 14 Coping with Stress 4Regardless of the types of stress-related behaviors, the students will be basically trying to figure out how to function in a brand-new environment. They may feel pressured to adapt quickly and succeed academically. They may be frustrated with themselves for not adjusting as fast as they think they shoul d be, or they may think that they are being judged for being \"different\" and not looking or acting like their peers. The reactions can vary and students will handle pressure in differ ent ways. As long as they know that they can apply strategies to ease the pressu re, they can start to manage their stress. Instructors should be awar e that some students in the Refugee Academy are so relieved and happy to be in a safe, stimulati ng environment that t hey will not consider themselves to be stressed at all. It is im portant that the instru ctors discuss how stress varies for everyone, and no student should feel that they should have a lot to stress about. In fact, after participating in the Refugee Academ y, the students may not feel nearly as stressed, and will feel prepar ed to handle any anxi ous moments. Note: Module 14 should not be introduced until st udents in the Refugee Academy have had the chance to talk about the topics in th e other Modules, and are comfortable with the instructors and other students. Ref ugee students have a number of physical and mental health concerns. Instru ctors should be alert for signs of severe stress, fear, depression or sadness, or the inability of students to cope. Be prepared with the names of school personnel who can be contac ted to meet individually with students who appear to be particularly stressed. 2. Daily coping strategies can ease stress . Stress management takes a variety of fo rms, but for the student s in the Refugee Academy, instructors should recommend daily co ping strategies that are easy to carry out. Instructors can recommend t he following that may seem obvious, but may be new concepts to the Academy students: \u0083 Participate in school clubs and extracurricular programs to stay busy, to meet new fr iends, and to experience new activities. This recommendation is especially important for students in middle and high sc hools, as they are often stressed about relationships in school and need opportunities to connect with their peers. \u0083 Eat a healthy diet . Students may get pulled into eating fast foods and unhealthy snacks, not only because it is a temp ting, new experience, but because the foods are easy to eat and can satisf y hunger and emotional needs. Students may feel like they fit in because they join their new friends at a fast-food restaurant. They may feel content to have a fattening meal, even if it is not the best food for their health. In structors should discuss how feeling healthy and fit can contribute to positiv e attitude and self-esteem . Recognize that for many refugee students, being able to eat a variety of foods is a significant experience Module 14 Coping with Stress 5for them. They may have very little k nowledge of a healthy diet and will need guidance. (See Module 6: Stay Healthy for more information.) \u0083 Exercise routinely . Refugee students may have discovered the infinite variet y of forms of entertainment that do not require moving from the couch. Explain that exercise will help students \"burn off\" stress, and will help with strength and confidence. Participation in exercise programs and team sports can help with physical and emotional well-being and can result in new friendships and a positive sense of teamwork and accomplishment. \u0083 Get organized . Students will have more sense of control of their new environment if their desks and lockers are neat, their school papers at home are in a central location and organized, and if they write down their assignments. Teachers notice dramatic improvement s in student behavior when they have organized their time and schoolwork. The Academic Coach can help students become more organized. (See Module 3 Transportation and Time and Module 9 Study Skills.) \u0083 Get assistance when stress seems to be dictati ng social activities, choices about the future, and feelings about personal worth. Students should be encouraged to talk to t he Academic Coach, the school nurse, the guidance counselor, a teacher, or anot her trusted adult if they constantly feel sad or worried. Module 14 Coping with Stress 6 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5 (60 minutes) In this activity: Students will have the chance to talk about what worries them. Instructors should not introduc e this activity unless the students are comfortable with the adults and students in the room. \u0083 Draw 3 pictures on a board or poster board, with sad, happy, and worried faces. Discussion Questions When do you feel sad? As students answer the questions, suggest possibl e stressors such as loss of family and friends in native countries, changes in living conditions and family membership and structure, unhappiness of loved ones, and financial and social strains. Remind students that they are not alone, there are others who are coping with the same issues, and the purpose of the Academy is to build support and friendships for the school year. Allow students to express their feelin gs. Do not let one person dominate the discussion, but be prepared to lis ten to students who want to te ll their stories. Take the time to let everyone share their concerns , always emphasizing the things that they have to look forward to, and the people who will help them. ACTIVITY #1: TALKING ABOUT WORRY Module 14 Coping with Stress 7When do you feel worried? The students will indicate that they are worried about many aspects of their new environment. Highlight specific worries that they ma y have about school, followed immediately by information that will ease their minds. It is im portant to mention t he worries so that students will not think that they are the only ones with concerns. Express confidence that they will be able to handle most situations and will eventually not worry about them, but when they need help they should not hesitate to ask for it. Possible worries that are typical of refugee students in a new school: \u0083 Getting lost or missing the bus \u0083 Being embarrassed and feeli ng stupid in front of peers \u0083 Experiencing harassmen t, teasing, and bullying \u0083 Saying the wrong words or doi ng the wrong thing in class \u0083 Disobeying rules unintentionally \u0083 Undergoing academic pressu re from home and school \u0083 Fearing teacher criticism or corporal punishment, based on previous educational experiences \u0083 Feeling insecure about conditions at home \u0083 Coping with health problems, disabilities, developmental or academic lags that make students feel as if they cannot \"fit in\" Students in middle and high schools may also worry about: \u0083 Keeping family history pr ivate for fear of misunder standings or repercussions \u0083 Wearing the wrong clothes \u0083 Falling behind in schoolwork or failing classes \u0083 Experiencing rejection by peers or the opposite sex \u0083 Managing family life; being em barrassed by family members \u0083 Being liked by peers while main taining cultural traditions Module 14 Coping with Stress 8 When do you feel happy? \u0083 Give students a chance to talk about what they are enjoying about their new lives in America and what they look forw ard to. It is important to end with this question so that the students can identify the positive aspects of their new lives in America. Point out what they can look forward to in school. Distribute Handout 14-1: Show How You Feel . \u0083 Ask students to illustrate when they are worried and when they are happy. \u0083 Discuss how worries may appear as signals of stress. (See Key Point 1.) \u0083 Discuss possible ways of coping with worry. \u0083 Discuss specific individuals in the school and how and when students can contact them. \u0083 Conclude the discussion by exercising in class. Do jumping jacks to burn off stress, practice breathing to calm dow n, and tell silly jokes to get everyone laughing and relaxed. (Check with the translators about jokes that the students would appreciate.) Module 14 Coping with Stress 9 Grades K-5 (60 minutes) In this activity: Instructors will role-play ty pical student dilemmas that could cause stress. As the instructors are reac ting to situations, their responses should be over-the-top, dr amatic reactions. Then repeat the scenario with calm, stre ss-reducing reactions. Ask students to pick the best way to handle the situation without getting \"stressed out.\" o Two instructors should act out each si tuation. One instructor is a student or teacher who init iates the situation, the sec ond instructor is a refugee student who reacts. Most of the role playing can be done nonverbally. o The first reaction should be very dramatic and loaded with signals of stress (yelling, defensiveness, irritability, crying, etc.). o The second reaction should be a dem onstration of how to handle the situation with calm and confidence, and should provide ideas about how to get help. The situations should be familiar to the students: o A fellow student steals a ball on the playground. o A student is called upon by t he teacher and is unprepared. o A student misses the bus. o A student is unclear about the teacher's directions and the bell is ringing. o A student does not have a lunch card or money for lunch. o A student is teased about her/his clothing. o A student cannot participate in an activity because of religious reasons. o A student wants more trustworthy friends. ACTIVITY #2: WHAT SHOULD YOU DO ? Module 14 Coping with Stress 10 Discussion Questions What should you always remember when you are starting to worry and get stressed? \u0083 Friends and t eachers will help. \u0083 Students who are mean and insensitive do not represent the entire student body and should be ignored or reported. \u0083 Simple stress-reduction techniques can help alleviate stress. \u0083 If students think ahead of time how they are going to handle situations, they will feel less stressed. For example, st udents may decide to walk away from students who are bothering them, or to approach a teacher to discuss problems with class work. Once those plans are in place, students should begin to relax. \u0083 Encourage students to have patience. When they meet with their Refugee Academy instructors and classmates later in the school year, they will discover that a lot of what they worried ab out is no longer concerning them.

One student says \"ha.\" The second student says \"ha ha.\" Th e third student says \"ha ha ha\" and so forth. Keep going around the room, encouraging students to speed up. Laughter is guaranteed. MODULE 15 STAYING SAFE Module 15 Staying Safe 1MODULE 15: Staying Safe PURPOSE The purpose of Module 15 is to inform students about safe alternatives to harmful activities that may be occurring in their schools and neighborhoods. OBJECTIVES Students will: \u0083 Learn anti-bullying strategies \u0083 Learn strategies for saying no to drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes \u0083 Learn how to become involved in school activities that are rewarding and safe \u0083 Learn how to identify and connect with trusted adults SUPPLIES Say Something By Peggy Moss Display Pictures: Feeling Hurt Hiding Hurt Landing Looking Out Tennis ball or small object (Activity #2) Handouts: Zero Tolerance No Bullies Allowed Join the Activity Fair Home Alone Home Alone Safety Tips After School Feeling Hurt Hiding Hurt Landing Looking Out Bully Friends!

Students will face decisions about negative activities in school, and can learn realistic strategi es for saying \"no\" to harmful activities. Refugee children can be among t he most vulnerable students in the school, especially if they have not learned English and have experienced trauma prior to enrolling in an American school. They are often lonely and anxious to make new friends and blend into their new communities. They may hav e heard stories about so me of the possible negative aspects of American schools and assume that they have to behave the same way, not realizing that all schools ar e different and all American students do not participate in unsafe activities. Refugee students may join in any activity that confronts them because they want to fit in, without recognizing that they have many choices about how to spend their time. Unfortunately, there are peers and adults in t heir communities who take advantage of the vulnerability of refugee students, for the purpose of doing harm. The harm can be done by teasing or bullying, or by supplyi ng drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol, or by pressuring students to join in gangs and ill egal activities. For refugee students who often cannot determine who is their true fr iend and who means them harm, the results can be unhealthy and dangerous. For some refugee students, drugs, gangs, violenc e, and other harmful activities may be a significant presence in their schools and the surrounding co mmunity. As the students try to adjust to the demands of a new school in America, they also try to navigate the challenges of a community that may be unsafe. It will be difficult for instructors to address topics such as bullying, drugs, and alcohol during the Refugee Academy and Mini-Academie s. Not only are the topics complicated and difficult to cover effectively in a limited amount of time, but in structors may not be trained or authorized to teach the subjects. In addition, discussion of the topics may offend families of refugee students. Module 15: Staying Safe addresses the theme that runs through all of the sensitive topics: how students can identify what may do them harm, and strategies for resisting involvement in harmful activities. The extent to which the instructors delve into the specifics of these sensitive topics will depend on the school district policies and programs, access to trained staff, receptivit y of the parents, and the amount of time available to cover topics in detail. No matter what the topic and level of detail, the message to refugee students should be that there are effective ways to resist getting involved in activiti es that will do them harm . For example, the school district may already participate in t he anti-drug DARE (Dr ug Abuse Resistance Education) program, and in structors can become involved in guiding refugee students through the DARE activities. Or the Health program may routinely include information about bullying in its curriculum and the instructors can reinforce the information Key Points - Sta ying Safe Module 15 Staying Safe 4provided in class. But even if those programs are not ava ilable, the instructors can teach the refugee students that they can say no to negative activities and that there are specific strategies that will help them to stay safe. The activities of Module 15 stress the importance of learning how to say no in ways that are useful and realistic. For ref ugee students, this learning process may be frightening because they may not be familiar with the issues. They may have been told information about American schools that is fright ening to them. Or they may feel that if they do not give in to the peers who pressu re them, harm will come to themselves or their families. Refugee students need to be aware of the realities of the negative aspects of school, and need to be prepared to resist. It is essential that instructors consul t with colleagues, including guidance counselors and local law enforcement, to determine the issues that may confront the refugee students, the policies and proc edures of the school dist rict, and the resources and means of support available to students who do say no. 2. The most effective way for refu gee students to resist involvement in unsafe activities is to become in volved in supervised activities. It is well documented that students who are busy in supervised activities, particularly right after school, are less likely to become involved in unsafe activities. They develop friends, build self-confidence, learn safe ways to spend their ti me, experience role models and mentors, and expan d their skills and interests. A positive adult presence can influence student decisi on-making, and provide emotional support to participants in extracurricular activities. For many refugee students, the opportunity to participate in after-school and community activities is a new concept. They may not know that programs exist. They may not know what it means to participate in sports programs, art classes, clubs, museum visits, and other activities that are established beyond the school day. They may be aware of the activities, but unaware of how to pay for them, obtain the uniforms, learn the rules, use the tools, and other aspects of extracurricular progr ams that they will need to know. They may feel that they are not welcome at activities sponsored by community agencies and religious groups, and are unfamiliar with terms such as \"club\" or \"retreat\" or \"tournament.\" Most significantly, they may hesitate to enroll in a program because they have not met any of the students and are afraid to st ep into a new activity with people they do not know. As a result, refugee students may shy away fr om activities that go beyond the daily requirements of school. In spite of the effo rts of adults to encourage refugee students to join a club or try out for a team, t he students may be busy concentrating on learning English and comprehending their new sc hool environment. Ol der students may be focusing on blending in so that they f eel that they belong and do not make any embarrassing mistakes. Every day is a chal lenge, and joining something new is often an overwhelming concept. Module 15 Staying Safe 5Many refugee students also have co mplicated family arrangements and responsibilities. They have child care super vision and part-time jobs, or parents who are most comfortable when the students come straight home after school. Some students are safer if they ar e able to get home immediatel y after school, instead of walking or taking transportation later in the day. All of these issues must be addressed by in structors as they recommend to students that they become involved in extracurricular activities. Telling refugee students that it is healthy for them to be busy will not convince them that they shoul d try something new. Their entire day is new, even if they hav e been enrolled in an American school for some time. There are strategies that instructors can employ to encourage students to seek out extracurricular activities. \u0083 The first step is to gather information about all available programs, even if some of them are routinely promoted by the school. \u0083 The next step is to inform students about their options by connecting the information to student interests. \u0083 The crucial third step is to tackle the process of overcoming student concerns and fears and facilitat ing enrollments. Module 15 provides activities for paving t he way to student involvement in extracurricular activities. In structors should prepare for the activities by contacting athletic directors, coaches, club supervisors, local religious groups, and community centers and gathering information and the names of potential speakers. Students who participate in the extracurricular activities should be invited to meet refugee students and share their experiences. (See Module 7: Interests and Talents in the Refugee Academy Curriculum ). As instructors are introducing information about the realities of harmful activities (e.g., drugs for sale on the street, alcohol available at parties) it is impor tant to immediately introduce alternative, positive activities. Afte r the instructor discusses the possibility of students being offered drugs, alcohol, or cigare ttes, the instructor should immediately discuss how the students can avoid settings where those negative activities might occur, or how to avoid students who are interested in doing harm to other students, emphasizing the importance of joining extrac urricular activities. Specific programs should be identified that have positive, safe activities, and that have enrolled students who are interested in staying safe and healthy. But most important, the process of getting involved should be emphasized. Typical questions that should be addressed are: \u0083 How do students join? \u0083 Where do they go and what will happen when they walk in the door? \u0083 Who else is there? \u0083 How will other students react when they join? Module 15 Staying Safe 6\u0083 Is it expensive? (Many programs hav e sliding scale enrollment fees.) \u0083 Where do they get the equipment? \u0083 What if they don't have the skills? \u0083 What if they don't under stand what is going on? \u0083 What if they can't go to every meeting or event? \u0083 How will they get there? How will they get home safely? The instructor should work closely with Academic Coaches, guidance counselors, and extracurricular supervisors to plan a specif ic program for each refugee student in the program. Interests and schedules will vary, but unless individualized attention is given to the enrollment process, re fugee students will tend to find themselves with idle time, thus increasing their vulnerability. 3. Refugee students are encouraged to confide in a trusted adult if they are concerned about unsafe activities. Should I tell an adult? This question comes up every day for m any students in school. They witness something unsafe or illegal, hear rumors that are of concern, exper ience an event that is disarming, or feel pressur ed to join in an activity that is unsafe. For refugee students, the question of whether to tell an adult is espec ially confusing. They are working hard to fit into their new environment, and do not want to call any more attention to themselves. They quickly figure out which students have leadership roles, who has allies, and who is treated poorly. Eventually t hey figure out that their fellow students do not always think that reporting to adults is the best approach to solving a problem. In Module 15 the students are informed in every activi ty that they shoul d not hesitate to talk to a \"trusted adult\" about concerns about unsafe activities. However, the realities of reporting to an adult should be recognize d so that students understand how to approach adults and what might happen when they do. It is not easy for students to talk to adults during a busy school day. It takes awhile for refugee students to figure out who they feel comfortable with, and who might react in a supportive manner. They may not know who their \"trusted adult\" can be. Since the repercussions of telling an adult (often regarded as snitching by peers) can be frightening, students often deter mine that it is better to say nothing. If they have become involved in unsafe activities such as the use of alcohol or participation in gang activity, they might not know how to di sengage and may believe that adults will just make the problem worse. They might be emba rrassed, afraid of the reaction of their parents, or confused about how to get help. Module 15 Staying Safe 7At the same time, there are refugee students who become involved in unsafe activities because it makes them feel as if they belong. If they are included in a group, regardless of the activities of that group, they feel as if they have a \"f amily,\" a source of friendship and support. They may feel important because they have been invited to participate and make a contribution to the group, even if the contributions are unsafe or illegal. They may think that they have been included in a group that is respected and admired, either because the other students tend to regard the group with respect, or because the group spins that message to new members of the group. For some refugee students, becoming involved in unsafe activities just means that they are fitting in. Talking to adults about their activities is definitely not considered acceptable. It is important to inform refugee student s in the Refugee Academy and Mini-Academy that their first responsibility is to look out for their own personal health and well-being. They will be surrounded by adults and peers who will care about their welfare, but the choices that they make about how they use their time will ultimately be up to the students themselves . The refugee students should be told specifically about what is unsafe and the repercussions of beco ming involved in activities that are unsafe. They need to know that if they are pr essured (or tempted) there are adults who will guide and support them. However, it is not enough to just tell students that they should report any concerns to an adult. The students will soon figure out that there are some adults who focus on punishment. They will know that there is pre ssure by peers to stay quiet. Instructors should recognize the realities of the pr essures, and inform students about how they can seek out assistance from an adult when they feel that their safety , or the safety of their peers, is at risk. Instructors in Module 15 should involve guidance counselors, social workers, Academic Coaches, English as a Second Languag e teachers, school safety directors, law enforcement officials, and principals as they prepare to discuss with students: \u0083 The specific adults who are prepared to listen to student concerns \u0083 Where and how these adults can be reached , especially if the problem is urgent \u0083 How confidentiality will be handled by adults \u0083 What steps adults may have to take to resolve a problem \u0083 What is already being done Module 15 is about how students can find alternatives to unsafe activities. At the same time, students need to know that trusted adults are readily available and willing to help. BACKGROUND : REFUGEES AND BULLYING What is considered \"bullying\"? Any behavior that is deliberately intended to hurt, threaten, or fr ighten another person or group of people is considered bullying. It is usually unprovoked and persistent, often continuing for a long peri od of time. Bullying is not always visible to others and can be verbal, emotional, and physical in na ture. Bullying may appear on the surface to be about anger and hostility, but it is bas ed on the desire to have power and control over someone who is vulnerable. Who are the targets of bullies? Since bullying is about power and control, any student who appears to be vulnerable can be a target. Bullies tend to focus on student s who are \"different\" in color, dress, race, behavior, mannerisms, size, physical appearance - and so forth. If the student tends to be timid, withdrawn, and/or anxious, then bullies will zero in on that student. The more the target is visibly affected by the bully, the more the bullying tends to escalate. Refugee students can become prime targets of bullies because they are often different in appearance and behaviors, may not be able to express themselves clearly, and can appear shy and confused. What is \"verbal\" bullying? Bullying can be physical (hitting, punching, poki ng, tripping, etc.) but it can also be verbal teasing and harassment. Examples are name-calling, threatening comments, insults, teasing, and mocking - as well as nuisance phone calls, spreading rumors, and written texts, e-mails, photos (including \"sexting\"), and Facebook entries (referred to as \"cyberbullying\"). What is \"emotional\" bullying? Emotional bullying can involv e leaving a targeted student out of activities, openly ignoring a student (or including them only to torment and tease), or purposefully setting up a student to be embarrassed. Any type of bullying can result in students feeling alone and helpless, distraught, ph ysically ill, or depressed. 8 Module 15 Staying Safe Who are the bullies? Bullies can be any students in the school, al though the image is that bullies tend to be students who are physically bigger than other students and/or have social status in the school. Bullies are seeking power and dominance. They like control of the situation. They may not be physically stronger, but feel stronger if they bully verbally or conduct anonymous cyberbullying. But bullies are not born to bully. There is usually something happening in their personal lives that may cause bullies to ta ke out their anxieties and anger on someone who is vulnerable. If they ar e struggling with school, have a di fficult life at home, or are abused or bullied themselves, they may tend to unload their emotions by hurting someone else. They may feel threatened if their status is te nuous, so they rally their peers to join them in hurting others. In turn, they get attention - even respect - because they appear to be powerful and in control. They appear to disregard rules and consequences. It is important to remember that most students who bully are hurting. They do need to experience the consequences of their actions , but they also need specific strategies on how to handle their emotions in a more positive manner. Students who bully do not automatically know how to change their behavior. They may not even understand the emotional damage that they are causing. In many cases they have never been taught how to treat others with kindness and respect. They need guidance in how to maintain peer respect while eliminating the bullying. They need opportunities to s hare their emotions in a safe environment, through counseling and peer support groups. Educator s can combine discipline with guidance so that the bullying stops. What is unique about bullying and refugee students? In some schools, refugee students are \"easy\" targets for bullies because refugees are often different in appearance and behavior. Cultural differences in dress, foods, family traditions, gender roles, and hygiene can cause some refugee students to be noticed and become targets. 9 Module 15 Staying Safe Refugee students may not understand that they are being bullied. They may not understand verbal teasing and insults because of language comprehension issues. They may have had traumatic experiences in their home country and do not recognize that the hateful actions directed toward them are unacceptable in American schools. As refugee students negotiate between two cultur al worlds, they may conclude that bullying is a normal way of life in the United States. In fact, they may tolerate bullying becaus e they are used to being treated poorly in their home countries. Past experience ma y have taught them to stay invisible and not complain. As a result, they may silent ly tolerate harsh treatment from bullies. These students may be used to fighting back to protect themselves or to save lives, so they continue to fight if they are bulli ed. They may be acting on instincts that were honed under harsh conditions in their home countries. They may lash out because they are distrustful, angry, or grieving. Fo r some refugee students, bullying can trigger post-traumatic stress symptoms. Refugee students can become bullies themselves , join groups of students who bully, or become members of gangs. They may feel as if they are part of a family or support group, even though that group is causing harm to other students. Some refugee students maintain negative op inions that are learned in their home countries about other ethnic gr oups. These opinions are later translated into acts of bullying behavior in their American school. It is important for educators to keep in mind that many refugee students already feel isolated and vulnerable. They may be the primary source of information and support for older family members who are strugglin g to adjust to a new country. They often cannot turn to parents and other adults within their family for guidance. When they are experiencing bully ing their choices seem to be that they can decide to put up with the bullying, fight back, initiate t he bullying to seize control, or try to find someone they trust who can understand and pr otect them. Any of these choices can cause anxiety. Str uggling with these decisions can inhibit their adjustment within the new school environment. If refugee students wish to tell an adult about w hat is happening to t hem, they may not know what to do. They may not be aware of helpful resources, even if they have been reassured that teachers, a local refugee center, or a school guidance counselor can provide assistance. 10 Module 15 Staying Safe If students have been told about what to do about bullying, they still may not trust the resources. They may be uncomfortable around a counselor they have not met before, or a school-based police officer. T hey will need to get to know them in a non-threatening setting. And like most childr en, refugee students fear that there will be negative consequences from peers if they report the actions of another student \u2014 particularly if they have lear ned in their home country that reporting can lead to drastic reprisals. As a result the refugee students can becom e depressed and lose confidence. They can be hurt every day and never say a word about it. It is a challenge for educators to simultaneously reassure new refugee students that they are safe in their new school \u2014 and then introduce information about bullying. But knowledge about bullying provides refugee students with the power to do something about it so that they can co mfortably adapt to their new lives in an American school. 11 Module 15 Staying Safe If refugee students are bullied, then school becomes yet another hostile environment that they have to experience. \u0088 Be aware of warning signs. \u0088 Tell refugees that bullying is an exception and not tolerated. \u0088 Tell refugee students what bullying looks like - and that they do not deserve to be bullied. \u0088 Recognize that bullying can be based on actual or perceived race, color, weight, national origin, ethnic group, religion, religious practices, disability, sexual orientation, gender, or sex. Refugee students need the opportunity to talk about how they can maintain their cultural traditions and still feel comfortable in their school. \u0088 Encourage refugee students to become involved in group activities, but stress that joining a gang is not considered a positive activity. (See Module 5 So Much to Learn! and Module 7 Interest and Talents for related activities.) \u0088 Discuss with colleagues how refugee students can be informed and protected. \u0088 Repeat anti-bullying messages in: English instruction classes School assemblies Meetings with Refugee Resettlement Case Managers Meetings with refugee families Classroom presentations Professional Development programs about refugees. \u0088 Know the civil rights of refugees - and that bullying based on language or national origin is considered harassment. \u0088 Establish systems for confidential reporting. Help refugee students identify a trusted adult in their lives. \u0088 Reassure refugee students that authority figures are safe resources, including school police officers. \u0088 Respond with sensitivity if a student reports bullying. Take it seriously, even if the incident seems minor. \u0088 Strategize with the student and provide reas surance. If necessary, refer the student to a colleague who can advocate for the student and take steps to ensure they are safe. \u0088 Discuss anti-bullying strategies that can be used before and after school with all refugee students. WHAT CAN BE DONE? 12 Module 15 Staying Safe POSSIBLE WARNING SIGNS There are many warning signs that could indicate that a student is experiencing bullying. Some of these signs are not obvious. Students are very good at hiding what is going on in their lives. Don't wait too long to look for patterns \u2014 trust your instincts if \"something isn't right.\" Any of these signs could be indicators of adjustment to resettlement, problems in their personal lives, or bullying: \u0088 damaged or missing clothing or other belongings \u0088 lost items such as textbooks, electronics, clothing, jewelry \u0088 unexplained injuries (or unbelievable explanations) \u0088 complaints of headaches, stomachaches, or feeling sick \u0088 trouble sleeping, frequent bad dreams \u0088 changes in eating habits; very hungry after school because lunch was stolen \u0088 less interest in friends and socializing \u0088 fear of going to school or other activities \u0088 less interest in schoolwork; grades slipping \u0088 avoidance of specific places such as lockers or hallways \u0088 hiding of text messages and computer activities Some signs may not be as visible, but even one incident may be a clue to something more serious: \u0088 appearing sad or anxious and trying to hide problems \u0088 expressing concerns about measuring up \u0088 feeling; expressing interest in becoming tougher \u0088 making comments about suicide \u0088 unusually angry \u0088 starting to bully others Bullying often happens to students who are consider ed \"different\" by their peers, especially if those students are withdrawn or anxious. Refugee students stand out because of their cultural background and language. They can be bullied because of the way that they dress, their family traditions, or simply because they are newcomers. Their insecurities can make them targets. Parents of refugee students may not be comfortable with the topic or know where to turn for help. 1. Establish a system for providing assistance to students if warning signs of bullying are detected. 2. Inform students how to recognize bullying and protect themselves. 3. Establish a system for students to safely report bullying. 4. Ask them to think about who could be a \"trust ed adult\" they could confide in, should they see or experience bullying. Refugee students are often most comfortable with an English Language teacher, guidance counselor, or refugee center representative.

Since refugee students are often anxious to be included in activities in American schools, and they want new friends, they can be tempted to participate in gang activity. In some cases, the refugee students do not realize that a gang is not a new \"fam ily,\" even though they may feel protected by their fellow ga ng members. They may feel as if the gang looks out for them, they are making a contribution to a group that they are included in (even if the \"contribution\" may be harmful or illegal), and the gang membership gives them status in the school community. Their own refugee parents, or the relatives and guardians who supervise t hem, are often unaware of the significant pressures to join a gang, and have difficulty monitoring the activities of refugee children during and after school. Module 15 addresses the pressures on refugee students to participate in any activities that can be harmful to them. Because the level and type of gang activity is school-specific, this Module does not incl ude activities specifically on the topic of gangs. In school districts where there is gang activity, the instructors should consult with school administrators and counselors, school and community law enforcement, and other community leaders to determine how to discuss the topic of gangs with the refugee students. Some districts have on-going programs or specialists in gang activities. Some schools invite ex-gang members, representatives from community groups and religious organizations, and other speakers to inform the students about t he dangers of gangs and how to resist becoming involved in gang activity. It is essential that instructors and Academic Coaches raise the topic of gangs with the refugee students so that they are informed, prepared to handle the pressures of joining a gang, and aware of the dangers of some gang activity. For example, they should know about gang sym bols and methods of recruitment and communication. Refugee students should know that supportive families provide protection without putting their children in harm's wa y. Refugee students should know about alternative options so that gang activi ty does not become their source of socialization and after-school activity. Talk to students about positive resources in the community such as clubs, religious centers, after-school programs, sports, and programs that fo cus on the arts. NEW YORK STATE DIGNITY FOR ALL STUDENTS ACT The New York State Dignity for All Students Act (The Dignity Act) seeks to provide the State's public elementary and secondary school students with a safe and supportive environment free from discrimination, intimidation, taunt ing, harassment, and bullying on school property, a school bus and/or at a school function. The Dignity Act took effect in July 2012. All public elementary and secondary students have the right to attend school in a safe, welcoming, considerate and caring environment. The goal of the Dignity Act is to create a safe and supportive school climate where students can learn and focus, rather than fear being discriminated against and/or verbally and/or physically harassed. The Dignity Act relates to bullying because bullying is a form of harassment and discrimination. Refugee students should benefit from the implementation of the Dignity Act because identified in the legislation are those who are subjected to intimidation or abuse based on actual or perceived race, color, weight, national origin, ethnic group, religion, religious practice, disability, sexual orientation, gender or sex. The New York State Education Department has established statewide work groups to address local and state policy, curriculum and instruction, professional development, and outreach related to the Dignity Act. For more information and instructional resources, see the New York State Educ ation Department website dedicated to the implementation of the Dignity for All Students Act: http:www.p12.nysed.gov/dignityact Information about the Dignity Act can also be found on the website of the New York State Center for School Safety. http://nyscenterforschoolsafety.org/ 15 Module 15 Staying Safe WHEN BULLYING MAY BE A CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATION Schools that receive federal funding (including colleges and universities) are required by federal law to address discrimination on a number of different personal characteristics. The statutes the Department of Education's O ffice for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces include: \u0088 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin; \u0088 Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex; \u0088 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504); and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title II). Section 504 and Title II prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. School districts may violate these civil rights statutes and the U.S. Department of Education's implementing regulations when peer harassment based on race, color, national origin, sex, or disability is sufficiently serious that it creates a hostile environment and such harassment is encouraged, tolerated, not adequately addressed, or ignored by school employees. While current law enforced by OCR do not protect against harassment based on religion or sexual orientation, they do include protection against harassment of members of religious groups based on shared ethnic characteristics as well as gender-based and sexual harassment of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender individuals. A school is responsible for addressing harassment incidents about which it knows or reasonably should have known. \u0088 Participate in the webinar Bullying and Civil rights: An Overview of School Districts' Federal Obligation to Respond to Harassment \u0088 Read the Dear Colleague Letter from Department of Education's Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights \u0088 Read more about when bullying is discriminatory harassment \u0088 Learn about the OCR civil rights complaint process.

Plan your route, including where you can go for safety. Stay alert - this is not the time to listen to your iPod. If you see the bully coming, c hange your route immediately. Do not try to tough it out. STAND TALL If you are confronted, you may w ant to cry or yell back, but bullies are hoping for a reaction. Don't show emotions, hold your head up, and keep on walking. If you are in danger of getting hurt, run. Throw something to distract the bully, if y ou can. There is no good reason why you should stay and fight, unless you are cornered and have to protect yourself. Get out of there. PRACTICE CALM WORDS If you are being bullied, it is usually best to sa y nothing at all to the bully. Move on. If you must respond, act as if you don' t care, keep moving, and say these words calmly: \"Whatever.\" \"You are wasting my time. I'm out of here.\" \"If you say so.\" \"I have more important things to do. See ya.\" DON'T GET PHYSICAL Keep hands down, don't hit or kick unless you have to defend yourself \u2014 and only if you were physically attacked first. Ther e is no good reason to stay and fight. Be smart and get out of there. TELL A TRUSTED ADULT Bullying can quickly get worse. If you see or experience bullying, talk to an adult. Think about who you would talk to if you ever need help. If you are afraid that a bully will find out y ou told, then ask the adult to help you figure out what to do to protect yourself. REPORT CYBERBULLYING If bullying is online, don't respond. Keep the evidence and tell an adult immediately. DON'T BULLY Just because it happened to you doesn't mean that you should bully someone else. You know that it hurts to be bullied. Th ink about how you can help other kids to be safe. 17 Module 15 Staying Safe \u0088 Soccer! I joined a team right aw ay. I made friends and my team protects me. Find a sport or club that you can join. It may take time to feel comfortable, but you will be glad that you did it. \u0088 I make sure that I wash every day and wear deodorant. My clothes are clean, my teeth are brushed, and I keep my head up and smile. Some kids are not sure how to talk to me at first but I make sure that I look friendly, and it works! \u0088 I signed up for the school play. I had no idea what was going on at first, but I got to paint scenery and helped pull the curtain. I was busy and surrounded by other people, so I felt safe. It was fun! \u0088 When I was being bullied I didn't want to tell anyone what was happening to me. It just kept getting worse. Finally I said something to my tutor. It was hard to do, but I'm safer now and the kid has stopped bullying me and other kids, too. \u0088 My guidance counselor gave me a student \"buddy\" to show me around. I was nervous at first, but I always know that I can go to my buddy with questions. He helps me with my English and comes with me when I need to talk to teachers. The other kids like my buddy so they are nice to me, too. Ask for a buddy who can look out for you \u2014 it definitely works for me. \u0088 I organized kids from the Refugee Center to walk home with me. It feels good to stick together. We change our route and our schedule so bullies can't wait for us. HERE'S WHAT I DID! TIPS FROM REFUGEE STUDENTS 18 Module 15 Staying Safe ANTI-BULLYING INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES The following resources have been selected for educators to use when discussing the topic of bullying with refugee students. All of the resources have been screened for content and accessibility. Educators should still check to ensure that the content is relevant for students. In some cases, the website provides background information for educators and parents only. Websites that contain materials in languages other than English have been identified. On occasion, a website will describe a schoolwide program consisting of publications, speakers, or assembly activities. Only those with a strong track record of success, particularly in addressing refugee students as targets, have been included in this list. Educators are advised to look at the Bullying Prevention Resource Guide \u2014 Best Practices for specific evidence-based guidelines on how to select and impl ement a schoolwide anti-bullying program. http://bullyingprevention.org/i ndex.cfm/ID/2/Best-Practices/ Another valuable source for screening school or districtwide programs is Misdirections in Bullying Prevention and Intervention , prepared by Stop Bullying Now! of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. http://www.education.com/reference/article/Ref_Misdirections/ The New York State Education Department has developed a clearinghouse dedicated to The Dignity Act, including a Fact Sheet, brochure, and slide show for educators. http://www.p12.nysed.gov/dignityact http://www.facebook.com/dignityact The New York State Center for School Safety serves as a clearinghouse for schools, families, communities, and government agencies, and has a number of valuable resources for educators. The Please Stand Up! program for middle and high school students focuses on bystander behavior. www.nyscenterforschoolsafety.org Individual classes and schools have developed their own anti-bullying instructional activities such as an excellent video created by the Glendaal Elementary School, Scotia-Glenville Central School District.

Emphasis should be on students getting in volved in activities that keep students busy, help them to make friends, and are supervised by adults. The activity should be more about safety than bullying. Instructors should explain to students t hat there may be a student or group of students who are mean to other students. They may want to frighten or even hurt someone who is new or different. Explain that it is wrong . Show Handout 15-12: Bully if students need a visual im age of what is meant by a \"bully\". Immediately distri bute Handout 15-13: Friends! Discuss that students will have a lot of new friends. To meet people they should try the activities on Handout #14 - Here's What I Did! Read the quotes on the next page aloud to the students. For each picture on Handout #14, provide information about: o why the suggestion is a good way to meet friends and keep bullies away o how the suggestion could be implemented in the local school and community The instructor should help students to decide what they personally would like to do t oget involved in activiti es and meet new friends. ACTIVITY #1: HERE'S WHAT I DID! Module 15 Staying Safe 30ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: Refugee students will practice 12 ways to say no when they are approached by other students and pressured to participate in an activity that is unhealthy or dangerous. The instructors will have to determine how much detail should be provided to the students about drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. Some students may need to know the specifics about what various drugs look like, how they are sold, and when the students may be approached by other student s and drug dealers. This information should be taught by experts who have experience s haring this information with students. Other students, particularly young students, may just n eed to know that they should not accept or purchase anythi ng from another student or adult unless they have permission from a known and trusted adult. The activity also introduces the topic of students who tease, harass, or bully refugee students. Again, the concept should be introduced so that students are aware of the possibility of bullyi ng behavior, but the in structors should determine the level of detail that should be provided. If there is a history of mistreatment of refugee students at the school, t hen more information should be provided about how refugee students can protect themselves. If the problem does not occur often, refugee students should still be aware of what bullying is (so that they do not think t hat it is normal and acceptable behavior) and how they can say no to students who treat them badly. The instructors should consult with the Academic Coaches, school administration, and other adults who ar e familiar with the refugee students to determine how much detail should be covered in this Module. However, all students, regardless of their age or ex perience in American schools, should learn many different ways to say \"no\" when they do not want to take part in an activity that is unsafe. The re fugee students may have to draw on the strategies in this activity , and they should be prepared. ACTIVITY #2: HOW TO SAY NO Module 15 Staying Safe 31\u0083 Distribute the Handout 15-1: Zero Tolerance The instructor should discuss each it em on the handout, explaining that the pictures show examples of items and activities that are not allowed on school grounds and can be harmful or dangerous to the students. If it has been determined that it is appropria te to provide more details, then the instructor may invite counselors, law enforcement officials, and school social workers to share more information. Ex amples of drugs, different forms of alcohol, how drugs and alcohol can be mixed with other substances, and other visual examples may be provided. The illustrations on the Handout 15-1: Zero Tolerance represent: Row 1: Drugs or alcohol, including prescription medications Row 2: Cigarettes, knives, guns and other weapons, including items fashioned to be weapons Row 3: Hunting knives and toys that are used for recreational activities, but are not allow ed on school grounds Row 4: Threatening or harassing notes, graffiti and other forms of vandalism \u0083 Distribute the Handout 15-2: No Bullies Allowed After presenting the information on the Handout 15-1: Zero Tolerance , the instructor should discuss the term \"bu lly\" and explain how refugee students may encounter bullies. The picture at the t op of the handout shows an example of an older student physically threatening a younger student, but it is important for students to know that bully ing comes in many forms. The rest of the pictures on the handout represent what student relationships should be like in school. Positive relations hips involve sharing, working together, enjoying each other's company, feelin g comfortable and relaxed, and helping each other out. \u0083 Throughout the activities in Module 15, it is essential that the instructors emphasize that most of the students in the school will be supportive and friendly. It may take awhile for refugee students to feel completely comfortable around other students, but the instructors should stre ss that if refugee students are afraid around other students then they may be experiencing pressure from peers who mean to do them harm, including teasing, harassment, or bullying. The instructor should explain: Teasing comes in the form of comments in front of others; mocking student dress or language; remarks that may not be overheard; or imitating student behavior. Module 15 Staying Safe 32Harassment is constant teasing, sometime s escalating to physical abuse such as pushing, threatening, follo wing students, or ri diculing and calling attention to a refugee student as a source of amusement. Bullying is when a student is exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more students, with an imbalance of power, intent to do harm, threat of further aggression, and intimidation resulting in fear. Bullying can be physica l, verbal, social, indirect, or clear and direct. It is not necessary for instructors to focu s on knowing the definit ions of the terms, but it is necessary to show that mist reatment of refugee students can appear in different forms. As instructors provi de the above definitions, they should give specific examples of how bullying might occur in the hallways, restrooms, and before and after school. Instructors may wish to demonstrate what bullying looks like by role-playing (with adults as the actors). Examples demonstrated can be: o Pushing, knocking against a student in the hallway o Taking books, backpacks, lunch cards, and other personal items o Taunting a student who is trying to find a seat in a classroom or cafeteria o Following a student or ge tting in the student's way o Physical abuse outside of school For older students, the instructors c an show how bullying and pressure to engage in dangerous activities might be co mbined. For example, a refugee student may be bullied to try alcohol, hide or deliver drugs, or hand over money, electronics, backpacks, sneakers, or other personal items. Some refugee students may have already experienced teasing, bullying and pressure to participate in harmful activities. They may volunteer information about their experiences, but until the inst ructor has determined that the students are comfortable with each other and the adults in the room, it is best to wait before asking students to share their perso nal experiences. Activity #6 of this Module focuses on how to share info rmation with adults about witnessing or experiencing teasing, harassment, or bullying. \u0083 The instructor should explain to the st udents that there are twelve ways to make it clear to other students t hat they will not participate in negative behavior and will not tolerate bullying. The students should be so familia r with the twelve ways that they can call on any one of the st rategies if a situation arises. Module 15 Staying Safe 33 12 Ways to Say NO! 1. Stay in groups with friends you can trust. 2. When you see trouble coming, walk in the opposite direction. 3. Be polite and say no thanks with confidence. Keep going towards a safe place. 4. Keep saying no and refuse the same way every time. 5. Change your route or your routine, as long as trusted adults know where you are. 6. Know about places of safety in sc hool, such as classrooms, libraries, and the health office. Know about places of safe ty in the neighborhood, such as local stores, busy streets, and homes of friends. 7. Change the subject. Make it cl ear that you are not interested. 8. Give the \"cold shoulder\" and make a point of not socializing with students who pressure or tease, even if they may be ni ce at times, or are well liked by other students. 9. Avoid situations that may cause problems. Sometimes pressure to join in or the need to feel included can encourage participati on in events that lead to harmful or illegal activities. Find something else to do. 10. Have a backup plan so that if a situation looks frightening, an alternative route has already been planned. 11. Stay calm, be firm, and do not encourage the behavior by reacting emotionally or arguing. 12. Get help from a trusted adult. After reviewing and demonstrating the 12 strat egies, the instructor should assist the refugee students in practicing each of the strategies. The instructor may have to provide the refugee students with the phrases they can use, and practice them with the students. T he phrases are important in case a point has to be made, but, in general, refugee students should refrain from talking and concentrate on moving away from negative situat ions. It is best to avoid a situation and not engage in a dialogue. Module 15 Staying Safe 34 Suggestions for helpful phrases for ref ugee students to learn in English are: o No thanks. o Do not bother me again. o Not interested. o Not my thing. o I told you before, leave me alone. The instructor may have to discuss how to handle the most stressful hallways in the school, alternative routes home from school, and specific areas around the school that may be more dangerous than others. Activi ty #2 in this Module discusses how students can seek help. The instructor, with the school district administration, shoul d determine what to tell the refugee students so that they have a realis tic picture, but are not intimidated or convinced that school is an unsafe plac e to be. Emphasis should always be on the importance of prevention, and on choosing to be friends with classmates who are friendly and helpful. Module 15 Staying Safe 35 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: Refugee students will learn about their role in stopping teasing and bullying. This activity is based on the picture book Say Something by Peggy Moss (Tilbury House Publishers, Gardiner, Maine), winner of a Teachers' Choice Award from Learning magazine. A young girl observes other students bei ng teased, and although it bothers her, she does not do anything to stop the teasing. Then she has a personal experience that helps her understand how it feels to be teased, and she resolves to do something about it. The book is appropriate for all ages, including middle and high school refugee students. At the conclusion of the book, there are suggestions for instructors about how to encourage students to step up and stop teasing. Since refugee students can be teased by other students, the focus on Activity #2 of this Module is to encourage students to look out for one another and say something if they witness teasing. If the students feel that they can pr otect a fellow student, or can say something that will stop t he teasing, they should spea k up. If the situation is frightening, they should know how to get help from an adult. And if they are being teased, they should know how to speak up for themselves and get help if needed. Instructors may want to differentiate betw een teasing and bullying. Activity #1 in this Module provides information on the definitions of teasing and bullyin g, but the primary difference is the aggressive nat ure of the teasing. Bullyi ng consists of repeated and systematic harassment and atta cks on others and can be carried out by individuals or groups. Bullying takes many forms, including: \u0083 physical violence and attacks \u0083 verbal taunts, name-calling and put-downs, sometimes based on ethnicity or gender \u0083 threats and intimidation ACTIVITY #3: SAY SOMETHING - HOW STUDENTS CAN STOP BULLYIN G Module 15 Staying Safe 36 \u0083 extortion or stealing of money and possessions \u0083 exclusion from the peer group Activity #1 in this Module covers the stra tegies that refugee students can use to say no to any activities that are ha rmful. In this activity, students reflect on how it feels to be teased, and what they can do about it to help themselves and their friends. Emphasis should always be on explaining to students that they should not tolerate anything that makes them feel uncomfortable or unsafe. \u0083 To introduce the book discussion, the instructors should explain to the students that t hey are going to play a game that shows how one person can make a big difference in changing behavior. To carry out this activity, the student s can either sit in a circle on the floor or move their desks so that they are connected in a square or circle. If the desks cannot be moved, it is still possible to conduct the activity with strai ght rows or clusters of desks, with some modifications. The students should be told to tap quietly on the floor or on their desk, with their fingertips. Everyone in the class does it together. The instructor can let the students tap for about a minute, and then tell them to stop to listen to the rest of the directions. The students should know that the point of the exercise is for one student to be able to get the tapping to stop. A small but visible object selected by the teacher (tennis ball, eraser, paperback book, box of crayons) is to be passed ar ound by the students, either to the student next to them, or to any other st udent in the room. The students can get up and move to pass the object to someone else. While the object is being passed around, a ll of the students ar e quietly tapping. The students should know that every parti cipant should have a chance to receive the object, so students should pay attent ion to who has not had a chance, and then include them in the pr ocess of passing the object. The instructor should explain to the student s that every once in a while a student may receive the object and then suddenly hol d it in the air. No one will tell the student to do this. The students can decide on their own whether they want to raise the object in the air. That is the signal that t he tapping should stop. The second the object goes in the air, all of the tapping should stop. Ev eryone sits quietly. The student with the object should wait about 15 seconds, and then continue passing the object around the room. When the passing begins again, the tapping starts up again. The students may want to stop frequently , or they may be hesitant to be the student who stops the tapping. The group may take a few minutes to understand the process, especially if t he students are unwilling to rais e the object in the air. Module 15 Staying Safe 37The instructor should be part of the acti vity and should make a point of raising the object in the air to get the tapping to stop, but should not verbally encourage the students to raise the object in the air. The instructor can continue the tapping exercise for 5-10 minutes, depending on whether the students seem to have gr asped the process, and whether all students have had a chance to receive and pass the object. \u0083 When the exercise is over, the inst ructor should point out how one student, making a personal decision, could stop t he noise in the room. The instructor should ask: o For those of you who raised the object in the air, what made you decide to do it? o For those who did not raise the object, why did you decide not to? o What did it feel like to be able to stop everyone from tapping? \u0083 The instructor should discuss how one person can make a big difference in changing the behavio r of other people. In the exercise, the students were abl e to temporarily stop the tapping. In school, one student can have a big influence on stopping behaviors that can be annoying and uncomfortable. The instructor can explain that the cla ss is going to read a story about one girl who was able to stop behavior that everyone else ignored. She did not think that she had the power to make a difference, but by taking one small step on her own, she changed the school experience of another girl in school. The instructor should read the book Say Something aloud to the group. Discussion Questions After reading the book to the group, the instructor can discuss the following questions, pointing out that students who tease others are often looking for attention, or want to feel that they are important. The girl in the story did not necessar ily challenge the students who tease, but she took a step to change th e school experience of another student and ended up making a new friend. Why did the girl sit next to the girl who always sits alone? What does it mean to be \"picked on\"? How do you think some of the children felt in the story? Module 15 Staying Safe 38Why do you think that students tease and laugh at others? What was done to the students in this story to make them feel bad? Why did the girl in the story notice the children who were unhappy in school? How is this story like the tapping game? \u0083 The instructor should show the pictures of the story again, without reading the words. The students should look for a pict ure that shows something that they have personally experienced. The instructor should go through the book slowly, showing the pictures without reading the words, and then go back th rough the book and ask the students to tell which picture they identified with. Each student may choose a different pi cture. They may c hoose a picture of a student who looks like them, or a pict ure of a student who is experiencing teasing. They may choose the picture of the girl sitting in the cafeteria, or the two girls laughing on the bus. Ask the students to tell why they identifi ed with the picture they selected. This process may be difficult for students if t hey are new to the school, if they are lonely or isolated, or are afraid to openly admit that they have been teased (or have teased other students). The instructor should invite each child to pick a picture and explain why they select ed it, but not force the discussion. The instructor should talk about how it feels to be teased, without asking for specifics from the students, and without identifying students who get teased in the school. Emphasis should be on how it f eels to be teased, and how it feels to witness teasing. The instructor should then ask the students: \u0083 Why is the name of this book Say Something ? The students may not realize that the young girl in the story does not really tell anyone about the t easing, but her actions are her way of saying something. By sitting next to the girl on the bus she is announcing that she is not going to let anyone be treated badly, and she is going to befriend someone who needs support and friendship. Some students will have already learned from their peers that it is risky to interfere with teasing or to report teasing to adults. Even befriending students who are being teased or bullied can be risky. If refugee students feel that befriending another student can cause mo re harm, then they need to discuss their concerns with an adult. Activity #3 provides information for the students on how to approach adults if they are conc erned about their own welfare or the safety of another student. Module 15 Staying Safe 39\u0083 Repeat the tapping game, this time by passing around the book Say Something . Encourage students to raise t he book in the air and say Say Something when they want to stop the tapping. Module 15 Staying Safe 40 ACTIVITIES Grades 6-8, 9-12 (120 minutes) In this activity: Refugee students will learn about healthy and safe activities that they can become involved in so that they have a positive use of their time after school. This activity builds on Module 7: Interests and Talents in the Refugee Academy Curriculum . In Module 7 students become familiar with the clubs and extracurricular activities that are offered in the school, and they have a chance to think about their personal interests and talents. In this activity, as part of Module 15 : Staying Safe , the students will have a direct opportunity to engage in different activities so that they can feel comfortable becoming involved in afte r-school programs that are healthy and safe. The purpose of the activity is to encourage students to fill their after- school time with activities that ar e fun and rewarding, rather than unproductive and unsafe. A number of \"stations\" will be set up in a large room, each station representing an activity that st udents might want to learn more about. The stations will be interactive and staffed by students who participate in the activity. The purpose of the rotation is to expose refugee students to all of the programs that are availa ble in the school and community, and to give them a chance to ac tually experience the activity. Note: This activity involves advance planning because the instructor needs to communicate with club leaders in the school, reach out to organizations in the community that o ffer after-school programs, and organize the Activity Fair. \u0083 For this activity, the instructor should reserve a classroom or large space such as a gymnasium or a stage that is big enough for several clubs and community groups to set up activity stations. The refugee students will be rotating to the different stations. The size of the space will be determined by the number of stations and the number of refugee students. ACTIVITY #4: ACTIVITY FAIR Module 15 Staying Safe 41 \u0083 The instructor should gather a list of addresses, phone numbers, or e-mails of all of the organizations in the school and community that provide after-school activities. The list should contain the following: o School clubs o Religious organizations that o ffer youth groups, classes, and recreational programs o Cultural centers that offer dance cl asses, cooking lessons, and special events o Recreation centers such as the \"Y\" or Boys/Girls Clubs o Sports programs, sponsored by the school and local organizations o Karate and fitness centers o Music, dance and theater programs o Libraries or museums t hat offer special programs o Gardening groups o Volunteer organizations that clean up neighborhoods, tutor, or provide assistance in nursing homes, food banks, health care centers, and shelters o Mentoring programs Each of the organizations s hould receive the Handout 15-3: Join the Activity Fair!. The instructor should follow up the mailing with a personal phone call, inviting the organizations to par ticipate in the Activity Fair. The organizations should be told that they are invited to send student representatives who will demonstrate what they do in t he program and what uniforms or costumes they wear, and will provide information about how refugee students can join. The student representatives should know that the refugee student s will have minimal skills in English, so the stations should be self-explanatory, with easy activities and entertaining demonstrations. Since the re fugee students will be rotating to several stations, all of the stations shoul d have activities that are short. Module 15 Staying Safe 42\u0083 The Activity Fair can be set up in many different ways, depending on how elaborate the instructor wants to make the event. The stations can consist of tables, chairs, easels, and balloons, or it can simply be the student representatives standing t ogether, demonstrating their activity and greeting refugee students. The Activity Fair may have to be in a classroom with each station marked off by a student desk. Or the desks could be pushed to the side, and the student representatives will take turns involving the entire class or refugee students in a short activity. The instructor is going to have to asse ss the time available for planning, the amount of space, the number of refugee students, and the number of organizations that have signed up to ta ke part. Academic Coaches, school counselors, school club supervisors and other school leaders should be involved in recruiting organizations to participate in the Activity Fair. No matter how the Activity Fair is set up, the following elements should always be included: o A number of stations so that refugee students can move around and visit each one, or at least have the opportunity to hear a presentation from each organization o The opportunity for students to engage in an activity at each station. Suggestions are: \u0083 Learning a dance step \u0083 Trying out sports equipment \u0083 Making a short and easy craft \u0083 Using the tools of the trade, su ch as gardening or cooking tools, cameras \u0083 Completing the forms for a library card \u0083 Trying on a costume or part of a uniform \u0083 Playing a game such as chess, a board game, or Frisbee o A large manila envelope for refugee students to collect information at each station o Information about the programs that t he instructor can review with the students Module 15 Staying Safe 43 \u0083 During the Activity Fair, the instructor, assisted by the Academic Coaches, translators, and other adults, should circulate to ensure that the refugee students are moving to all of the stations. The ref ugee students should not be forced to participate in the activities at each station, but they may need a little encouragement to try something new. One of the essentia l elements of the Activity Fa ir is the interaction between the student representatives and the refugee students. The adults can certainly help with communication, but it is important that the student representatives encourage the refugee st udents to join them in future activities. \u0083 After the Activity Fair, it is important for the instructor to review the information provided in the stations, and discuss what the refugee students need to do next to get involved in a new activity. Since the purpose of the Activity Fair is to encourage students to use their after-school time in positive, productive ways, the instructor should expect the refugee students to identify one or two acti vities that are appealing to them. It may be difficult to get them to take t he steps that are necessary for joining a new activity. The Academic Coaches can work with the students to help them enroll, find transportation, raise funds or waive fees, purchase uniforms and equipment, and feel comfortable the first time they attend a new activity. The leaders of the clubs and organizations s hould also be notifie d that they will have a new participant. Discussion Questions What station did y ou enjoy the most? Did you learn anything new? What activities would you like to try in the future? What do you have to do to join the activities that interest you? What questions do you have about joining? Module 15 Staying Safe 44 ACTIVITIES Grades 6-8, 9-12 (120 minutes) In this activity: Refugee students will have the oppor tunity to plan how they will use their time in a positive manner if they are home alone or supervising siblings after school. Many refugee students are expe cted to go directly home afte r school and stay in their home or neighborhood. They may be responsible for siblings or elderly relatives, may have household responsibilities if the par ents are working, or may live in neighborhoods where the parents prefer that the st udents stay indoors where it is safe. For some students, after-school activities ar e not possible because of transportation or expense, or simply because the students will arrive home when it is dark outside, and the parents are more comfortable if their children come straight home from school. In this activity, the refugee students will be lo oking at how to use their time at home effectively. The instructor should be stre ssing the importance of having a plan on how to use the time productively and safely. Since so many children, particularly those in middle and high school, get involved in unsafe activities between 3:00 and 6:00 p.m., it is essential that refugee st udents know how to use that time wisely. Even those students involved in after-school activities will have school days when they are home alone. \u0083 The instructor should begin by di scussing how the students get home from school and what time they usually a rrive at their homes. The following questions should be discussed: o What is the first thing you want to do when you get home from school? o What time is it when you walk in the door of your home? o Is anyone else home with you? o Are you responsible for making sure that a brother or sister gets home safely? o Are you responsible for supervising a brother or sister when you get home? o Does an older brother or sister supervise you? Does that work out well? ACTIVITY #5: HOME ALONE Module 15 Staying Safe 45 \u0083 The instructor can then pass out the two-page Handout 15-4 & 15-5: Home Alone , discussing each picture. The pictur es show the options of how to spend time, as long as the use of time is balanced and homework is completed. The students can add more suggestions. Discuss the following for each picture: (Sink) Students should be told that t he very first thing they should do when they get home is wash their hands. This is good hygiene and prevents the spread of disease. They should make sure that they wash if t hey are going to handle food or play with younger children. They might consider washing a few dirty dishes, too! (Milk and crackers) The instructor should discuss the types of snacks that are healthy. Also discuss the bes t time to eat a snack so that there is still room fo r dinner. (Academic Coaches should be alert to ho mes that need food.) (Television) It is so easy for students to settle down in front of the television and stay there. They may prefer to do their homework in front of the television, or eat snacks while sitting on the couch. The instructor should talk about the importance of limiting television viewing to one show that they are permitted to watch. This guideline is extremely hard for students to follow, since their friends watch different shows and it is so tempting to settle in and watch one show after another. Encourage students to pick a s how and build the rest of their schedule around it. Discuss with t he students what they watch on television after school, and when they work on their homework. (Sending text messages, working on the computer) When students use the computer unsupervised they can wander on to websites, intentionally or unintentionally, that are not safe. Module 11: Technology in the Schools in the Refugee Academy Curriculum discusses the safe us e of the computer. Students should be aware of the im portance of withholding personal information, the weaknesses of info rmation storage, and how computers can be used to connect with children in unsafe ways. Some students will be curious to see websites that are inappropriate, or will be encouraged by peers to investigate websites that are not approved by adults. Their parents may not speak English and may be unaware of some of the dangers of computer use. It is essential that the instructor talk about the positive use of the computer for finishing homework, researching assignments, and connecting with friends. Module 15 Staying Safe 46State repeatedly that st udents should not communicate with someone they do not know and should not share personal information or photographs. This is a difficult message to get across, so it will have to be repeated several times. (Listening to music) Students may have listening devices that allow them to play music. Instructors should remind the students that when they have headphones on they may not be able to hear their siblings, and they are closing off potential communication with family members. At times this may provide them the solitude that they need, but they s hould know when to take the headphones off. For many refugee students, listening to music is one of the best ways to connect with American culture and feel part of the group. It is also a means of connecting with personal herit age if students can listen to music from their native countries. (Exercise) Some students may be permitted to go outside when they are home alone, so it is necessary for the instructors to discuss safety when playing in the neighborhood. The students should be forewarned about staying away from groups or locations t hat are unfamiliar or threatening. If they are approached and feel unsafe or uncomfortable, they may have to find another location (even if it is indoors) to get exercise. The instructor should discuss the types of exercise students can do in their own homes to stay healthy and fit and to work off stress from a demanding day at school. Exercise can also be done with siblings as a form of entertainment. (Play with siblings) It is challenging for older brothers and si sters to supervise younger siblings. They may want to be with their friends, or simply left alone after a busy day at school. Many older students, however, ar e the babysitter for the family. The instructor should discuss the significance of their role in helping a younger child develop. Stress that a babysitter is a role model and o ften imitated. The older child should know how to intera ct with a younger sibling, how to set limits on interruptions and demands, how to engage in activities that are fun for all ages, and how to make sure that everyone is safe. The instructor may want to invite students to participate in a babysitting course (such as those conducted by the Red Cross) if there are a number of students who are responsible for their younger siblings. Module 15 Staying Safe 47(Homework, hobbies, and research projects) There are two pictures that show students working on homework, so that the instructor can point out that some homework should be done right away and other homework may have to be done later in the evening. In this activity, students will have the chance to plan wh en they can get their homework done. (Nap) Some students may discover that they need time after school time to take a quick nap. (Book) After school is the best time to read a few pages in a new book, even if the reading is not assigned by a t eacher. The instructor should reassure students that they will eventually be able to read books in English. In the meantime, they should select books that have illustrations that appeal to them, and should check out books about their native country and about their life in America. \u0083 The instructor should di stribute the Handout 15-6: Home Alone Safety Tips and discuss each of the pictures. The students can add more safety tips. These tips are demonstrated by the pictures: o No cooking unless an adult has given permission. o Leave doors locked and do not open the door to a stranger. o Friends are allowed only with permission, and one friend is usually enough. o Always supervise younger children, especially when they are on the computer. Check on younger children often, even if they are just in the next room. o Plan a project that everyone can work on, or help younger students with their homework. o Call an adult to let them know that you have arrived home safely. Module 15 Staying Safe 48The instructor should also discuss how a student can make it easier for older students to supervise them. They should come home when they are supposed to and respect the privacy of the older child. If supervision consists of conflict rather than gui dance, the student should talk to the parent or Academic Coach. Some older students resent the responsibility of taking care of a younger child, and need to know how to be an effective role model. \u0083 After discussing the handouts, the instru ctor can help the students to plan their time after school. The students may have scheduled clubs and after school activities, but they will have school holidays, snow days, and other time off when they will be home alone. It is helpful if all of the students have already thought about the best use of thei r time when they are by themselves. Emphasis should always be on the health y and safe ways that students can spend their time after school. The instru ctor should remind the students of the possibility that their peers may pressure them to use their time to try drugs and alcohol, or other unsafe activities. Remind the students that if they have a busy schedule, they are less likely to get involved in activities that can do them harm. The Handout 15-7: After School helps students to keep track of what they have accomplished after school every day. Distribute multiple copies of the handout to the students and ask them to che ck off or circle their after school activities every day for a week. The in structor or Academic Coach can review the handout and discuss with t he students how they organi zed their time, and what they were able to accomplish. It may be discovered that students are spending a great deal of time on homework, or they may be overwhel med with the responsibilities of supervising siblings and household chor es. Discussion of the handout is an opportunity to find out how the students are spending their time after school, and if intervention by the Academic Coach or counselors is necessary. All three handouts can also be used in m eetings with parent s, so that the school is partners with the parents in moni toring the after school activities of the refugee students. Module 15 Staying Safe 49 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (60 minutes) In this activity: Refugee students will learn about how to identify trusted adults, how to approach them for assistance, and when it might be necessary to speak up. Refugee students learn that if someone is being hurt physically or emotionally, the students can take ca re of themselves and others by connecting with a trusted adult. The key to this activity is to hel p students understand that they should ask themselves one question when they obs erve or experience teasing, harassment, pressure to parti cipate in harmful activities, or bullying. This is the question: Is someone being hurt? Instructors can encourage students to tr ust their feelings when they are uncomfortable or frightened at how they (or other students) are being treated. If their instinct is that someone is being hurt emotionally or physically, then they need to consult with a trusted adult. Unfortunately, the pressure to stay qui et and look the other way is powerful, and refugee students quickly figu re out that if they tell an adult about what they have witnessed, they can be tar geted for harassment by their peers. They may also feel that it is necessa ry to chime in as a bystander, so that they do not antagonize the bullies. In Activity #1 of this Module, the students learn about 12 ways to say no to harmful activities and the importance of not perpetuating them . The instructor should review the information in Activi ty #1 with the students, so that the students have already prepared themselves to face difficult situations. ACTIVITY #6: IS SOMEONE BEING HURT? Module 15 Staying Safe 50 \u0083 Instructors should display the picture Feeling Hurt (Handout 15-8) and discuss what it feels like to be sad and afraid in school. Discuss the importance of personally asking the question, Is someone being hurt? when witnessing teasing or bullying in school. The following additional questions should be discussed: ?? How do you think this duck feels? ?? How do you know? ?? Where is the duck? ?? Why would someone feel sad in school? ?? If someone is being teased or bullied, how would they look? \u0083 Instructors should then display the picture Hiding Hurt (Handout 15-9) and discuss how some students may be emot ionally distraught, but hide their feelings. The following questions should be discussed: ?? Can you always tell when someone is sad or afraid? ?? Why would someone hide thei r feelings in school? ?? What would be some clues that someone is hiding their feelings? Instructors should point out clues, such as students missing school, sitting alone, not interacting with friends, i gnoring schoolwork, and not participating in school events. At the same time, instructors should point out that some students are very good at hiding their feelings. They work hard, participate in school activities, and get good grades, but they are hurting and not telling anyone. Instructors should recognize that t hey may be describing students in the room, so it is important to look fo r students who either respond positively to the topic and need to share how they feel, or for students who seem particularly uncomfortable with discussing their feelings. In this activity, four laminated pictures are needed for the teacher to display. Copies of the pictures are also include d in the Handouts (Section C), should the teacher wish to reproduce the pictures as handouts. They can be used with any age group. Module 15 Staying Safe 51\u0083 The instructor should then display the picture Landing (Handout 15-10). In this picture, the duck is looking for a safe place to land. The instructor should discuss how there are places to go for help in schools and in the community. The students just need to be able to identify a safe place to land. The instructor should identif y adults in the room such as Academic Coaches who can help st udents who are sad or afraid. There are additional adults who can be trust ed, but since refugee students will not know who they can trust until they actua lly meet adults who can be supportive and respectful, the instructors should invite school police officers, guidance counselors, ESL teachers, and other adults who are readily available in the schools to personally meet the students. The instructor can also invite representatives from the local community, including law enforcement, religious officials, community-based agency staff (e.g., Boys and Girls Club coaches) and health workers. The purpose of the invitation is to facilitate a connection so that students will see a familiar face of a person who can be trusted if th e students need help in the future. The instructor should emphas ize that any teacher can be a source of support. Ask the refugee students to think about a teacher they enjoy and encourage them to approach that t eacher if they need help. The students should be told how they approach adults in school, when the adults are available to help, and w hat will happen when they tell an adult about what they have observed or what they are feeling. It is especially important to tell the students that adults may have to take steps to rectify a situation, especially if the activity is illegal and/or someone is being hurt. Adults may provide guidance and support, but they may also have to formally report incidents. The instructor should be prepared to explai n how confidentiality is handled in the school. Confidentiality is very impor tant and adults will do what they can to be discreet and protect the students, but they may have to consult with other adults to solve the problem. In ot her words, full confidentiality may not be possible. The following information should be explained: ?? How to decide if an adult needs to be told \u0083 Remind students to ask, is someone being hurt ? ?? How to approach an adult to get help \u0083 Discuss the best times to approach adults, and, if necessary, how to approach adults without other students knowing. Module 15 Staying Safe 52 ?? Where the adults are located and when they are available \u0083 Discuss how students can walk in to offices or make appointments, and how they can take advantage of tutoring sessions and meetings with counselors and Academic Coaches to bring up concerns. They may be able to approach teachers before and after class, or after school. If students can e-mail their teachers, inform them how they can ask for help without describin g the problem in the e-mail. ?? What words to use when telling how a student is getting hurt \u0083 Students may need to know how to say I need help or can you help me with a problem? ?? How to talk to an adult even if other students say don't tell anyone . \u0083 It is critical that refugee st udents understand that even if they are told not to tell about w hat they have experienced or observed, even if they or their loved ones are threatened, there are safe ways to inform adults and get help. This topic is particularly sensitive when students are well aware of the repercussions of being called a \"snitch\" and reporting on their peers. They are also aware that many students will not tell and they may be alone in reporting a pr oblem. Instructors may need experts in bullying, gangs, or counseling to talk to the students about the importance of protecting themselves and their peers by informing adults about problems. If students feel that adults al ready know about the problem, they should still inform the adults about their own experiences, particularly if they are pressured to participate in a harmful activity. The adul ts can provide guidance and support, and will look out for st udents who are trying not to get involved in negative activity. \u0083 Instructors should then display the picture Looking Out (Handout 15-11) to reinforce t hat there are adults who are looking out for them. Emphasize that adults want students to be happy and safe in school, and need students to help them in achieving this goal. Module 15 Staying Safe 53 JOURNAL TOPIC Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 Who will I talk to if it is really hard to say no to things that are not good for me? What will I say? SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES \u0083 Visit after-school activities so that students can experience them first-hand. In vite parents and assist them as students sign up for new programs. \u0083 Contact local agencies that can provide uniforms, costumes, and equipment so that students can comfortably enroll in after-school programs. \u0083 Assign club mentors to refugee st udents who are interested in joining a school club. \u0083 Teach students non-aggressive self-defense tactics, including how to send messages of confidence. \u0083 Implement the activities in the Mini-Academy Curriculum that stress the importance of refugee students relying on each other and protecting peers from harm. \u0083 Arrange individual meetings for each refugee student with school personnel who can be a \"trusted adult\" for future consultation. \u0083 Guide students in creating posters for the school that depict the importance of treating ot hers with kindness and respect. The posters can show the following phrases with a drawing illustrating how it feels to be bullied or harassed: \u0083 Don't laugh at me \u0083 Respect me Module 15 Staying Safe 54 \u0083 Kindness gets kindness back \u0083 We are ALL different \u0083 Don't hurt me \u0083 It hurts when you are mean \u0083 Lift me up - don't put me down \u0083 Create papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 masks that depict the feelings of students when they are treated well and when they are mad or sad. Display the masks with an explanation: This is how I feel when you hurt me, or This is how I feel when you are nice to me. \u0083 Order the free One World Poster Set from www.tolerance.org featuring artwork and text from Teaching Tolerance magazine. The posters contain vocabular y words that will have to be translated or defined, but the me ssages related to tolerance of diversity are appropriate for all students in all classrooms. MODULE 16 HATE CRIME Module 16 Hate Crime 1 MODULE 16: Hate Crime PURPOSE The purpose of Module 16 is to inform students about bias-related or \"hate\" crime and the importance of reporting bias-related incidents. NOTE: Module 15: Staying Safe provides information to students about coping with harmful activities such as bullying that may be occurring in their schools or neighborhoods.

Refugee students may experien ce bias-related or hate crime. A hate crime is any unlawful act designed to frighten or harm an indi vidual because of his or her race, religion, ethnic/national origin, or sexual orientation. Perpetrators of hate crime intend to terrify or harm a specific victim or an entire group. According to New York State statute, a hate crime is any one of a set of offenses attempted or committed \"in whole or in substantial part because of a belief or perception\" regarding specific groups of people. The New York law includes race, ethnicity, sexual orientati on, disability, age, gender, and gender identity. Related federal and state laws pertain to t he intentional defacement, damage, or destruction of any religious property because of its religious character. Laws also address the obstruction of any person's free exercise of religious beliefs by force or threat of force. (State laws vary.) It is not always easy to determine if a crime is bias related, but some overt signals assist investigators in identifying an incid ent as motivated by hate. Examples are the presence of visible symbols of hatred and bias , and/or reports by victims or witnesses of language and treatment that focus on the victim's appearance or beliefs. A hate crime can take two forms : either a criminal act or hate speech. Incidents of either (or both together) can involve physical assault, damage to property, bullying, harassment, verbal abuse or insults, or offensive graffiti or letters. Some hate crimes are commi tted with the absence of any clear motive other than focusing on the victim's race, ethnicity, sexu al orientation, religion, and/or disability. According to the American Psychological As sociation, \"Most hate crimes are carried out by otherwise law-abiding young people who see little wrong with their actions. Alcohol and drugs sometimes help fuel thes e crimes, but the determinant seems to be personal prejudice...Such prejudice is most likely rooted in an environment that disdains someone who is 'different' or sees that differenc e as threatening.\" Law enforcement officials and attorneys und erstand that prejudicial behavior occurs along a continuum and can involve negative speech, discriminatory practices, bullying and ostracizing, and property damage, as well as more violent crimes such as physical assault. It is up to the judicial system to determine the definition of the crime and the punishment and to decide if a bias-related event is a hate \"incident\" or a hate \"crime.\" They will determine if there should be an enhanced penalty because the crime was motivated by bias. Key Points - Hate Crime Module 16 Hate Crime 4 Investigating hate crime is the number one priority of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Civil Rights Program. A hate crime is a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism wit h an added element of bias. For the purpose of collecting statistics, Congr ess has defined a hate crime as a \"criminal offense against a person or property, motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race , religion, disability, ethnic origin or sexual orientation.\" Hate itself is not a crime - the FBI is mindful of protecting freedom of speech and other civil liberties. Source: Federal Bureau of Investigat ion Hate Crime Overview, February 2009 2009 Hate Crime Statistics Source: FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program In 1990 Congress enacted the Hate Cr imes Statistics Act, mandating data collection on crimes that are motiva ted by hate, overseen by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 6598 si ngle-bias incidents reported 48.5% motivated by racial bias 19.7% motivated by religious bias 18.5% motivated by sexual orientation bias 11.8% motivated by ethnicity/national origin bias 1.5% motivated by disability bias The largest percentage of hate crime incidents: 31.3% near homes; 17.2% on highways, roads, alleys, or streets; 11.4% at schools or colleges; 6.1% in parking lots or garages; 4.3% in churches, synagogues or temples. Module 16 Hate Crime 5 Organized Hate Crime In Healing the Hate: A National Hate Crime Prevention Curriculum for Middle Schools , developed by the Education Development Center for the United States Department of Justice, the aut hors point out that violence and prejudice are learned behav iors and not inevitable. Hate groups have been organized that teach members to hate (such as the Aryan Nations, a neo- Nazi group), using indoctrination and paramilitary systems. With in tensive recruitment and inst ruction, new members can become increasingly attached to an excl usive group that promotes power and superiority over others. An organization whose primary purpose is to promote animosity, hostility, or malice against a specific group on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, disability, or sexual orientation is consi dered a \"hate group.\" These gr oups usually have a similar belief system based on misogyny, racism , homophobia, theology and other views that differ from that of t hose of the group they have ident ified to hate. Some hate groups promote xenophobia, or the fear and hatred of st rangers such as foreigners (or anything that is foreign). Some st ress ethnocentricity, or the belief in the superiority of their ethnic group. Some hate groups are formed in response to local events or changes in the community. For example, the relocation of a new group of refugees could prompt the formation of a hate group intent on targeting the refugees. As a result, hate crimes are sometimes referred to as \"message crimes,\" with offenders attempting to send members of a specific group a message, saying that they are unwelcome in school, the neighborhood, the community, or in the United States in general. Law enforcement officials are aware that certain dates might trigger hate crimes by organized groups intent on co mmitting bias-related crimes, such as: \u008b January 15 - Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday \u008b April 20 - Hitler's birthday \u008b November 9 - 10 Kristallnacht (Night of the Broken Glass, when German mobs in 1938 destroyed synagogues; over 91 Jews were killed; 30,000 Jews were thrown into concentration camps; 7,000 Jewish businesses were destroyed; and thousands of Jewish homes were destroyed). \"Hate crime is the violence of intole rance and bigotry, in tended to hurt or intimidate someone because of their race , ethnicity, national origin, religious, sexual orientation, or di sability. The purveyors of hate use explosives, arson, weapons, vandalism, physical violence, and verbal threats of violence to instill fear in their victims, leaving them more vulnerable to attacks and feeling alienated, helpless, susp icious and fearful.\" Source: Hate Crime: The Violence of Intolerance , Community Relations Service, Washington, D.C. Module 16 Hate Crime 6 Hate Crime and Refugees There is considerable research on who jo ins hate groups, why they join, and what can be done about educating young people about the groups that they may be joining. Several organizations have been formed to protect people from hate groups, and to work with schools to educate students about the recruitmen t efforts of hate groups. In 2008 the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) joined with a coalition of seven national civil right organizations (including the National Urban League, the Jewish Defense League, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights) to denounce a series of hate crimes against immigrants and refugees. Their goal is to work together to monitor incidents of hate crimes nationwide, promote hate crim e legislation, and reduce prejudice and increase tolerance of differences. Refugee students can be targets of hate crime because of race, religion, ethnicity or national origin often because the perpet rators are uneducated about refugees, ill- informed about the background or lifestyles of refugees, or are making assumptions about refugees who relocate to the United States. The purpose of Module 16: Hate Crime is to raise the consciousness of refugee students about the existence of hate crime, and inform t hem about ways to protect themselves from bias-motivated incidents. They will also learn about the importance of reporting hate crime. One recent crime that is being prosecuted as a hate crim e is the murder of Jose Sucuzhanay, an Ecuadorean immigrant who was walking arm-in-arm with his brother in the cold weather in Brooklyn. They were trying to keep warm. Two men allegedly attacked them, shouting anti-His panic and homophobic slurs. Sucuzhanay was beaten with an aluminum baseball bat. The crime is considered a hate crime not because the victim might have been Hispanic or gay, but because his alleged assailants thought he was and attacked him on that basis . Module 16 Hate Crime 7 NEW YORK STATE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT GLOSSARY OF TERMS All schools in New York State are required to repor t violent or disruptive incidents on a regular basis to the Ne w York State Education Department. The following New York State Education De partment Glossary of Terms Used in Reporting Violent or Disruptive Incidents (August 2008) clarifies how bias-related incidents and crimes are defined in New York State school districts: BIAS-RELATED INCIDENT An incident is bias related if it is motivated by hate due to some characteristics or perceived characteri stics of the victim including race, gender, religion, color, sexual orient ation, ethnicity, ancestry, national origin, political beliefs, marital stat us, age, social and family background, linguistic preference, or disability. An y act or attempted act is bias related if it is designed to cause physical in jury, emotional suffering, or property damage through intimidation, harassmen t, racial/ethnic slurs and bigoted epithets; vandalism; force, or threat of force, motivated all or in part by hostility to some real or perceived char acteristic of the victim. (Note that this definition is taken from the Nati onal Center for Education Statistics.) INTIMIDATION , HARASSMENT , MENACING , OR BULLYING BEHAVIOR AND NO PHYSICAL CONTACT Threatening, stalking, or seeking to coerce or compel a person to do something; intentionally placing or attempting to place another person in fear of imminent physical injury; or engaging in verbal or physical conduct that threatens another with harm, incl uding intimidation through the use of epithets or slurs involving race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, religious practices, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability that substantially disrupts the educational proces s, with or without a weapon. MINOR ALTERCATIONS Involving physical contact and no physical injury, with or without a weapon. Striking, shoving, or kicking another person or subjecting another person to unwanted physical contact wit h intent to harass, alarm, or seriously annoy another person, but no ph ysical injury results. Fights that do not result in physical injury or seri ous physical injury are reported in this category. Module 16 Hate Crime 8 2. The negative effects of hate cr ime on victims and witnesses can be long-lasting. Victims of bias-related crim es can experience post-trauma tic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety attacks and nightmares, and a sense of violation and degradation. They may have physical, emotional, even financial hards hips as the result of a hate crime. Effects on the community, including the school environment, can be: \u008b Increases in tension related to race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation \u008b The possibility of reprisals that can escalate violence \u008b Friction with local law enforcement, particularly if they do not appear to respond quickly or with an understanding of hate crime laws. Refugee students should be aware that even hate \"incidents\" should be reported, not only to protect the victim, but to protect individuals and groups fr om future events. Any hateful incident in school harms the entire school community. Instructors who become aware of a possible hate-related incident should inform their super visor/director and not try to handle the situation personally. The incident could quickly become a legal issue that shou ld be handled by qualified law enforcement officials and attorneys. Since refugee students may feel uncom fortable, even frightened, around law enforcement, it is important that instruct ors provide reassuranc e and education for the student, and gather other personnel to support the student through any investigations. Instructors should be aware of the process for referri ng refugee students to mental health counselors, since victims can expe rience post-traumatic stress and fear of reprisal. Any communication with parents and t eachers should be the responsibility of qualified school personnel. According to the New York State Educatio n Department division responsible for VADIR (Violent and Disruptive Incident Reporting), in cidents of targeted violence at schools are rarely sudden, impulsive attacks. Some one usually knows of the attacker's plan. Most attackers either talk about their pl ans or engage in some behavior that causes concern. Refugee students may not be in a position to hear rumors or engage in conversations with a student who may be planning a bias-rela ted attack. However, as they become acclimated to their new school, they ma y either observe or experience negative behaviors that send a clear message that they are not welcome on the basis of their race, religion, or ethnicity. Module 16 Hate Crime 9 As refugee students become mo re aware of students who treat them poorly, they can become alert to the possibility of more aggressive behaviors and talk to teachers and instructors if they are uncomfortable or frightened. If the Instructors explain during t he Refugee Academ y that most attacks are premeditated, the refugee students can play a valuable role in thwart ing potential incidents. Instructors can show that t hey understand that the topic of hate crime is difficult to discuss. Refugee students have come to America in hopes of finding a safer way of life. It is hard to tell them that they are safe, but have to be alert to the possib ility of being treated badly because of their appearance or beliefs. Instructors should keep emphas izing that most students will be kind and helpful. If the refugee students are awar e of strategies for staying safe in their school and community (see Module 15: Staying Safe ) and know of multiple resources for getting help if needed, then they should not be c oncerned. As one counselor at a Refugee Center indicated, \"We don't want these kids to think that they've gone out of the frying pan into the fire. Tell them the facts, reassure them, point out their peers who are wonderful to newcomers, and be there if they need you.\" Even if the students reveal that they hav e observed or experienced a bias-related incident, they may not want to continue the conversation. The instructor should find time to talk to the students or ensure that a supervisor tal ks to the students privately. Immediate follow-up is import ant without adding dr ama to the situation. The focus should be on reassurance and support, without ev idence of shock, disgust, or anger toward the perpetrator. The refugee students may be conc erned about anonymity. However, instructors should not promise to keep information confidential. If students ask the instructor to promise not to tell anyone, the inst ructor should explain that support will be provided as students share information with authorities. It is not always possible to keep information confidential, for the benefit of the st udents and for other potential victims. The instructor should keep in mind that the disclosure of an event may eventually result in a criminal case, so the sooner sch ool personnel can take over the situation, the faster the victim can get appropriate lega l assistance. If it appears that the student has an urgent need for safety (or an entire refugee community may be affected) then the school administration shoul d be notified via the instruct or's supervisor. If the supervisor is not immediately available, a school administrator should be told so that appropriate law enforcement and legal advisors can be contac ted for support of victims and witnesses. Module 16 Hate Crime 10 3. There are systems for reporting and investigating hate crime. Anyone can become the victim of a hate cr ime for something they do not have any control over, such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or disabilit y. Individuals can be identified with specific groups by their participation in religious organizations, community events, or school clubs, or by the neighborhoods that they live in. However, these associations can be misund erstood, especially by those who have not been educated about different cultures, or have been taught that anything different is wrong or dangerous. \"Victims of hate crimes rarely do any thing to provoke an attack. They are selected simply because of w ho they are perceived to be.\" Source: Criminal Justice Training Center, Napa Valley, California Victims of hate crime need reassurance from school offi cials and law enforcement that bias-related incidents will be viewed as serious violations of the law. Victims are often terrified of retaliation if they report the incident, or even ostracism from their own community if they speak up. They may not trust law enforcement because of past experiences in their nat ive countries, and may fear deportment. Law enforcement groups across the country have received specialized training for identifying and investigating hate crimes, and many large communities have established units dedicated to bias-related crime. According to A Local Prosecutor's Guide for Responding to Hate Crimes , \"some jurisdictions have appointed one person who acts as a liais on between the police and prosecutors, while others hav e established a chain of command for sharing information with other law enforcement agenc ies. For example, the Tria l Division of the New York County District Attorney's Office works closely with the Ne w York City Police Department in investigating and prosecut ing bias-motivated cases.\" (American Prosecutors Research Institute) Module 16 Hate Crime 11 Key elements of law enforcement training can be applied to school personnel, as long as trained administrators follow school policies and procedures . Instructors and Academic Coaches may be in a position to assist administrators in carrying out an investigation, and should always provide support to the student involved. Law enforcement guidelines include: \u008b Report rumors and student comments, even if they are not presented seriously at the time. \u008b Explain to refugee students who confide in a teacher about a possible or committed hate crime that it must be reported to protect the victim and future victims. \u008b Academic Coaches and their supervisors should always begin by reporting an incident to school administrators. The school officials will notify law enforcement and follow the policies of the school district. District leaders should always consult with an attorney to ascertain the extent to which federal and state hate crime and civil rights law may apply in the school context. \u008b Control and remove other students from the area of the incident. \u008b The victim should not be blamed for the incident. \u008b Do not make assumptions about the victim on the basis of physical appearance, dress, language, or location of the incident. (Refugees may not be aware that a location is un safe, may not have a choice about where they live, or may not underst and words that are being used to taunt or threaten.) \u008b Record the sequence of events, in cluding information about previous threats or warnings. \u008b Record specific language, often used as key evidence in hate crimes. This may require assistance from an interpreter. Reports of witnesses about statements and gesture s should be recorded. \u008b If there is physical damage (e.g., defacing, spray painting), take photographs. Pictures of the victim should be taken by investigators. \u008b If literature has been distri buted, wait for law enforcement to collect the documents. \u008b Provide support and comfort to a st udent, but for legal reasons let the investigators express regret t hat an incident happened on school grounds. Reassure victims of hate in cidents that they will be supported throughout the investigation and a fterward. Many victims will be Module 16 Hate Crime 12 concerned about the repercussions of reporting an incident and may not understand the importance of reporting. They may also not understand the impact of an event on their emot ional well-being. (See Background Information #3 above.) \u008b Take the crime seriously to reduce fear and anger (of both the victim and the community) and to reduce the potential for copycat or retaliation crimes. School personnel can ensure that counselors and interpreters are available if the victim and the witnesses need to discuss the experience. \u008b Recognize that perpetrato rs of individual bias-related crimes may be affiliated with a large hate group in the community or the nation. 4. A discussion about \"hate\" should be conducted with sensitivity and accuracy. Even though Module 16: Hate Crime is not about the origins and manifestations of hate, some students may want to talk about the topic of \"hate\" in general. They may have personal stories to tell and want to find explanations for why people exhibit hate. It is not uncommon for victims to ask \"why do they hate us?\" or \"why me?\" or \"what causes people to hate?\" The Refugee Academy is not the setting for a serious, in-depth discussion of the many facets of hate. However, if a student raises questions that go deeper than basic information about hate crimes, the student should not be ignored. That student may be representing the question s of others in the group, especially if there is tension between students because of hateful experiences in their country of origin. The refugee students may need reassu rance from the instructor that the topic of hate can be discussed openly. They will need to know that hate does not dominate the cultur e of most American schools and that hate can be eliminated. The following points can be made if students seem anxious to explore the topic further. \u008b Hatred of refugees is usually based on fear of the unfamilia r or the unknown. People tend to be wary of something that is different, even if they are generally open to change and new experiences. They need accurate information and may need time to adjust. \u008b People are not born with hate. They learn it. If they l earn it, they can \"unlearn\" it. People can be taught t hat hate is wrong and can be guided into better understanding of people they have learned to hate. Module 16 Hate Crime 13 \u008b People who hate may have developed dist rust because of past experiences or historical events in their country. This is true of refugees, too. The instructor should point out that rese ttling is a good way to move forward and develop trust again. \u008b Some people are threatened by groups who don't believe the same things that they believe, particularly in areas of religion and cultural traditions. With education and civil interaction with refugees, people who may be resistant can learn to \"tolerate\" others instead of automatica lly hating them. If they express tolerance, it means that they are comfort able with their own way of life, but appreciate that not everyone has the same views or lifestyles. This concept may be hard for some of the refugee st udents to understand because they themselves may have learned intolerance for other groups. The instructor should focus on the im portance of harmony and tolerance as they forge a new life in a new country. \u008b Victims of hate can have em otional injury without evidence of physical injury. Instructors should explain that some peopl e do not know that they can inflict emotional damage that is just as powerful as physical damage. \u008b Hate can be eliminated, but perhaps only gradually, one person at a time. Refugee students should take their time to form friendships with other students who are tolerant and supportive. They should avoid students who exhibit hateful behaviors and make a point to be civil, pleasant, and proud of their heritage. If they need assistanc e in coping with someone who shows hate, they should talk to an adult who can help educate and cultivate tolerance. Facilitating Sensitive Discussions Instructors and Academic Coaches may have to facilitate challenging conversations around the topic of hate. Some class discu ssions can become very personal and sensitive. All personal co mments by refugee students, no matter how emotional, should be followed by some form of acknowledgment by the instructor. Instructors should become fam iliar with the characteristics of the students in the class so that it is easier to dete rmine if it is necessary to stop the class activity and respond to a student's comments. Some students will openly reveal personal information routinely, and a simple acknowledgment of interest and support will do. \"Thank for sharing with us. That mu st have been hard. Let's talk later so you can tell me more about it.\" Module 16 Hate Crime 14 Some students will suddenly speak up for the first time, requiring that the class agenda be set aside temporarily and revelations discussed. Emphasis in any discussion should always be on moving forward and solving a problem instead of reviewing the details of an experience. \"This sounds like something that others may have experienced. Does this sound familiar? What do you think should be done?\" \"Are there suggestions? What steps can be taken to solve this?\" Some students will make statements as fact, not knowing that they have misinformation or have been taught information in a different manner than other groups (e.g., beliefs about religion, sexual orientat ion, or roles of wo men in society). The instructor should gently ex plain that not everyone belie ves the same things and the result is an interesting mixture of cult ures worldwide and in the United States. The instructor should not question beliefs or attempt to point out the weaknesses in the \"facts\" provided. Understanding and accepting different points of view should be emphasized, not who is \"right\" or \"wrong\" in their beliefs. This is true even if a student makes a statement that is blatantly prejudicial. It is not the instructor's responsibility to reeducate the student. In some cases, a gentle correction might be appropriate, as long as the instructor does not challenge the views of the family or refugee's community. For example, if a student claims that everyone associated with a specific religion promotes violence, a correction can be made. \"In this country you can have many different beliefs. You believe one thing and someone else could believe something else. It is a good idea to think about why you believe someth ing and check out the facts. The important thing is to accept that we all think differently and it is a safer world if we don't hate each other.\" Some students reveal information for shock value, or because they do not realize that they are sharing information that indicates a need for counseling. The instructor will have to determine on the spot if the student needs individual attention, if the class should become involved in the discussion, or if there should be minimal reaction followed by a return to the agenda. \"You should know that you are not alone. It takes courage to even mention that situation. Let's meet after class and we can talk about it some more.\" Module 16 Hate Crime 15 No matter how a refugee student has reveal ed something personal related to the general topic of hate (or related to hate cr ime) the instructor should always provide support or invite the support of other students. The instructor should be aware of school and community resources for reporting incidents and gathering further information, and should always inform their supervisor or the Refugee Resettlement Case Manager. 5. Refugee students with their schools can help educate students and school personnel for the purpose of promoting cultural tolerance and overcoming prejudice. Definition of Prejudice Attitudes or opinions about a person or group simply because the person belongs to a specific religion, race, nationality, or other group. Prejudices involve strong fee lings that are difficult to change. Prejudice is prejudging. A person who thinks, \"I don't want (name of group) living in my neighborhood,\" is ex pressing prejudice. Source: What to Tell Your Child About Prejudice and Discrimination , Anti-Defamation League The root cause of prejudice is heavily debated in the literature. Some researchers believe that prejudice is the same regardless of the specific target, while others believe that prejudice is \"situation specific,\" det ermined by current event s. Others write that prejudice is based on power, economic or political, and can be personalized through group training or individual experiences. Regardless of the source of prejudice, there are a number of strategies for counteracting prejudice. The general school population should bec ome familiar with the benefits of multiculturalism and the va lue of the unique c haracteristics of individuals. Specific steps can be tak en to encourage students to be tolerant of diversity and treat their peers with respect. Teachers can employ conflict resolution and mediation techniques, as well as violence prevention by helping students understand attitudes and behaviors that promote violence. Module 16 Hate Crime 16 In an attempt to minimize the dev elopment of prejudice, well-meaning adults often teach children to ignore differences and focus on similarities. Just as common experiences are part of the \"glue\" that holds communities together, understanding and respecting differences is essential for successful multicultural societies. Source: Close the Book on Hate , Anti-Defamation League Students who are refugees should not be expected to bear the burden of eliminating prejudice. It is not their responsibility to change attitudes and behaviors. However, they can facilitate understanding and tolerance by communicating information about their values and culture. If they are assisted in acclimating successf ully to American schools, they will not only feel more comfortable with their peers, they will be rega rded as newcomers who are willing to adapt to a new culture. They will have an easier time connecting with other students and forming friendships. As their fe llow students get to know them as individual people rather than representations of a refugee group, they can quietly educate while still retaini ng important elements of their cultural history. For example, if a student practices a religion that is unfamiliar to peers, it is not necessary to abandon the religion to fit in to a new school environment. But it is quite possible that American students may ask questi ons, show resistance or disdain, or even taunt and tease about the religion. Refugee students will need to know how to handle these reactions while still building positive relationships. As friendships build, respect and understanding can grow, and refugee students can begin educating friend s about their personal histories and beliefs. This takes time (and often guidance from adults) but can result in reduced tension and higher tolerance of differences. This module, although focusing on identifying a nd reporting hate crimes, includes activities that are centered around building positive relationships for the purpose of eliminating prejudice. (See also Module 2: Making Friends .) Module 16 Hate Crime 17 According to New York State Education Law (for Social Studies), Article 17 (Section 801a) the New York State Board of Regents \"...shall ensure that the course of instruction in grades kindergarten through twelve include a component on civility, citizenship, and character education. Such component shall instruct students on the principles of honesty, tolerance, personal responsibility, re spect for others, observance of laws and rules, courtesy, dignity and other traits wh ich will enhance the quality of their experiences in, and contribut ions to, the community.\" \"A common saying among educators working to promote children's appreciation of diversity is that t here is no gene for racism. Thus, they believe that even though children may initially develop and act on intolerant attitudes, they can be educated to va lue human differences.\" (Wendy Schwartz, Anti-Bias and Conflict Reso lution Curricula: Theory and Practice, 1994.) Researchers and hate crime specialists agr ee that prejudice reduction and violence prevention are vital to reduc ing incidents of hate crime. Communities, schools, law enforcement, and other justice system agenc ies need to work together to promote tolerance and peaceful problem-solving. Strategies include increasing public awareness about the goals of hate groups and laws related to bias-related crime; acti ve crime prevention plans that include representatives from all facets of the community; and fostering a \"zero tolerance\" atmosphere in schools. This includes wri tten codes of conduct, support for peaceful conflict resolution, and clear consequences for engaging in bias-motivated behavior. Instructors should be aware of the policies of their school district and incorporate hate crime education in classroom activities and discussions. Module 16: Hate Crimes informs students about the definition of hate crime and the rights of refugee students, but emphasizes the import ance of improving communi cation between members of different cultural groups and reporting bias-related crime. Instructors and school pers onnel have the added responsibi lity of intervening with students who express discriminatory beliefs . This may be challenging, as some refugee students have experienced per secution from different groups (e.g., religious or political groups) or may hav e learned prejudicial viewpoints about groups from their native countries (e.g., Tu tsi and Hutu in Burundi). Emphasis in instruction should be on the laws that protect refugee students, what to do if t hey feel that they are being subject to bias-related crim e, and how to refrain from perpetuating biased points of view themselves. Module 16 Hate Crime 18 ACTIVITIES Grades K-5 (45 minutes) In this activity: Students will learn the importance of appreciating cultural differences and the benefits of being kind instead of hating. The public service announcement DVD Don't Hate - Be Kind will be used as a discussion tool. Note: Instructors should revi ew Background Information #4 in this module on facilitating sensitive discussions. \u0083 Explain the word \"kind\" and ask students if they have experienced kindness since they have arrived in America. Ask for specific examples. o A person who is KIND is nice, considerate, and concerned about the needs and happiness of others. \u0083 Explain the word \"hate\" as the opposite of \"love.\" o Hate is a very strong dislike of something. Hate can cause extreme discomfort, anger, and sometimes acting out in dramatic or violent ways. Ask students to describe foods t hat they hate to eat or sounds that they hate, such as fire alarms or screeching brakes. Ask them how it feels when they eat a food they hate, or when they hear a sound that they hate to hear. Explain that the word \"hate\" is often used casually, as in \"I hate that sound!\" or \"I hate sweet potatoes!\" ACTIVITY 1: DON'T HATE - BE KIND (PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT ACTIVITY )Module 16 Hate Crime 19 o The use of the word \"hate\" when applied to people is inappropriate and inconsiderate. Explain that it can be very hurtful to say \"I hate you\" or to show hate with angry words or by hitti ng someone. Students should not say \"I hate my teacher\" or \"I hat e you\" to another person even if they are angry. Sometimes they will not be able to tell that they are hurting someone's feelings. Some students may feel that students who are mean deserve to be told that they are hated. Ask the students, \"How would it feel to be told that you are hated?\" Explain that hate will only stop when everyone works hard to be kind and helpful. When it is hard to be kind, it is better to look for situations where kindness is easie r, and stay away from people who promote hate. Some of the students will have exper ienced hate, either as part of a refugee community or in t heir personal lives at home or in their new living environment. They may have difficulty understanding that hate is not necessary. Instructors should keep repeatin g the definition of \"kind.\" \u0083 Show the public service announcement DVD: Don't Hate - Be Kind \u0083 Explain that sometimes other students or adults may attack people because they are different. This is a way of showing hate and is not allowed in school and in the community. o Stress that this does not happen often, and that most of the students in the school will be kind and helpful. o Explain that there might be a few students who have learned to hate others because of the color of their skin, their religion, what they wear, or how they speak. These students do not understand that all people are different and everyone deserves respect. o These students may tease the refugee students. They may try to cause harm to property (such as grabbing a backpack) or physically hurt a student (such as pushing or tripping). o Keep repeating that this behavior is not allowed in school, especially if the offender mentions the student's race, co lor, ethnicity/na tional origin, or religion. Module 16 Hate Crime 20 o Stress that this behavior should not be accepted as \"normal\" school behavior, and refugee students should tell a teacher or their Academic Coach. o For younger students, the instruct ors should keep stressing that if someone is not kind to them, they s hould tell their teacher or Academic Coach. Their school does not want anyone to be treated unkindly. o The students do not need to know t he difference between a hate \"incident\" and a hate \"crime.\" They need to k now that treatm ent that is uncomfortable or frightening, especially if it is connected to their status as a refugee, should be reported to an adult as soon as possible. \u0083 Refugee students may be hesitant to reveal their concerns, but if they are reminded that they are protecting others as well, they will be more likely to share information. o Ask the students to discuss what they can do to show that they are kind to others. Point out that kindness can lead to a positive reaction and more kindness. o Demonstrate kindness by asking students to do the following tasks. After each task below, do an act of ki ndness. Ask the students: \"What did I do that was kind ?\" \u0083 Ask a student to: Drop a book on the floor. o Pick up the book, dust it off, hand it to the student. \u0083 Ask a student to: Trip over a backpack on the floor. o Help the student, ask if they are okay, move the backpack. \u0083 Ask a student to: Look for a pencil or pen. o Produce a pencil or pen, offe r it to the student, smile.

Module 16 Hate Crime 26 Grades 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: Students will learn the school process for reporting bias-related incidents or hate crime. This activity should follow Activity #1, and should only be presented to students after they have had a chance to discuss the definition of \"hate\" and the importance of kindness. Note: Instructors should review Backgroun d Information #4 in this module on facilitating sensitive discussions. \u0083 Even if the students have already seen it, show the public service announcement DVD Don't Hate - Be Kind . \u0083 Review the concept of \"hate\" as discussed in Activity #1. \u0083 Review Handout 16 - 1 What is Hate Crime? and show the DVD: Know Something - Tell Someone . \u0083 Students play a very significant role in preventing hate crimes. o Explain that students are expected to r eport hate crimes to an adult if they see them or experience them. They are expected to tell adults about rumors they have heard, plans they may be aware of, or threatening acts they have observed. o If they see teasing of a refugee, particularly if it appears to be based on prejudice, the students should tell an adult. They can stop the teasing from turning into a criminal action. ACTIVITY 2: IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING - TELL SOMEONE Module 16 Hate Crime 27 \u0083 Review the steps for reporting a bias-re lated incident in their school. Use the Handout 16 - 2 Know Something - Tell Someone. The steps for the student will vary depending on the school, but they generally consist of the following: 1. Tell an adult you trust. Don't be afraid to tell. You will protect yourself and others. 2. Ask a translator, Refugee Resettlement Case Manager, and/or Academic Coach to join you when you are r eporting to school or law enforcement officials. 3. An adult investigator will be res ponsible for gathering information about the incident. Be prepared to provide deta ils, whether a victim or a witness. 4. If there is evidence (e.g., graffiti , photographs, letters, destroyed property, etc.) bring it along. 5. Remember that hate crime should not be consi dered a minor disciplinary behavior, such as mean students just fooling around. A hate crime is against the law and is not allowed in sc hools. The investigator will take it seriously and will probably ask a lot of questions. 6. Ask witnesses to join in the reporting pr ocess. If they won't join (or try to talk the victim out of reporting), don' t push it. The investigators will ask for their names and will interview them privately. 7. Victims and witnesses who report hate crimes are helping the people in the community and are helping to keep the school safe. If students fear the repercussions of reporting, they s hould tell adults about their fears. If a teacher, Academic Coach, or Refugee Resettlement Case Manager offers additional support such as counseling, both victims and witnesses should accept the offer. Victims of hate crime can feel sadness, anger, confusion, and depression. Some people cannot sleep after experiencing a hate crime, or they may feel fearful when they go to school. Witnesses can also have these feelings. Adults in school want refugee students to feel comfortable and safe in school and can help them cope with the aftermath of a hate crime. \u0083 Review the concepts of the public service announcement DVD Don't Hate - Be Kind. Module 16 Hate Crime 28 Grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: Students will understand how they c an help erase prejudice in their school. This activity should follow Activity #1, and should only be presented to students after they have had a chance to discuss the definition of \"hate\" and the impor tance of kindness. Note: Instructors should review Backgroun d Information #4 in this module on facilitating sensitive discussions. \u0083 Even if the students have already seen it, show the public service announcement DVD Don't Hate - Be Kind. \u0083 Review the concept of \"hate\" as discussed in Activity #1. \u0083 Discuss the meaning of the word \"prejudice.\" o For younger students, use the following definition of prejudice: \u0083 Strong, bad feelings about a pers on or a group, based on the way they look. A person who thinks \"I don't want those people in my neighborhood\" is s howing prejudice. o For older students, use the fo llowing definition of prejudice: \u0083 Attitudes or opinions about a person or group simply because the person belongs to a specific religi on, race, nationality, or other group. \u0083 Prejudices are strong, bad feelings about a per son or group, based on the way they look or the things they believe. \u0083 A person who thinks \"I don't w ant those people living in my neighborhood\" is s howing prejudice. ACTIVITY 3: ERASE PREJUDICE - WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT , BUT WE LIKE THE SAME THINGS ! Module 16 Hate Crime 29 o Give the following three examples of prejudice. Stop after the three examples so that students won't feel uncomfortable and personalize the examples. Younger students may be confused becaus e this may be the first time they have ever been asked to think about prejudice. Older students may be aware of prejudice as a concept, but may not realize that prejudice against refugees could exist in Americ a. Still others may be well aware of prejudice in their new country and f earful that they will be victims of discrimination and hate crime. Review the definition of prejudice again before providing the examples. The examples of prejudice are: 1. Not liking someone just because they have a different skin color. 2. Not liking someone because they dress differently than everyone else. 3. Not liking someone because they go to a different church or temple. \u0083 Ask students to share examples of pr ejudice that they may have witnessed. Discuss how people sometimes draw conclu sions based on little knowledge. Tell the students that they are going to be drawing pictures to show who they are and what they can do. Then maybe people will have a better understanding and won't draw conclusions. \u0083 Discuss how people are all differ ent, but all deserve respect. o Point to individual adults in the room. 1) Point out basic characteristics th at make them different from one another. For example: \u0083 Abeer has curly brown hair. Amina has long black hair. Abdi has short brown hair. \u0083 Abeer, Amina, Abdi are all different. That is what makes the class so interesting. Module 16 Hate Crime 30 2) Then point out their similarities. For example: \u0083 They are ALL nice. \u0083 They are ALL helping you to learn. So they are also the same in many ways. We are all the same in many ways. But we should enjoy our differences because otherwise life would be boring! 3) Repeat the example with types of clothing. (Abeer is wearing a sari, etc.) \u0083 Distribute crayons or markers and Handout 16 - 3 Who Am I? o Ask the students to draw a picture of themselves in the mirror, showing an activity that they like to do. They should include anything different and special about themselves, such as wearing clothes fr om their native country, eating foods that are not always available in the United States, or celebrating a family holiday. \u0083 Distribute Handout 16 - 4 What Do I Like to Do? and ask students to draw something that they have enjoyed since they arrived in America. They may show that they like to play on the playground, go to McDonald's, ride on the subway, etc. \u0083 Display the drawings in the school with the title: We Are All Different - But We Like the Same Things! o The purpose of the display is to show American students that the refugee students may be different in appearance, but they enjoy doing the same things that American students like to do. Module 16 Hate Crime 31 Grades 9-12 (45 minutes) In this activity: Students will have the opportunity to talk about their feelings related to hate crime by discu ssing the lyrics of a popular song. Instructors should review Background Information #4 in this Module on facilitating sensitive discussions. Note: This activity should be carried out after Activity #2 has been completed. \u0083 The song \"If No One Will Listen\" (lyri cs below) is a po werful, emotional song. The instructors should screen the song lyrics with their supervisors to ensure that the older students can comprehend the meaning of the lyrics and discuss them comfortably. The lyrics should be translated. o Distribute Handout 16 - 5 If No One Will Listen to the students and discuss how they think the words could be about experiencing a hate crime. The song is sung by Americ an Idol winner Kelly Clarkson, and was written by Keri Noble. A CD of the s ong is available in most stores and on- line, but the students do not need to hear th e music if the instructor is not able to obtain the CD. o Some older students may need to talk about how they feel when they are treated badly by their peers. They may have experienced or witnessed hate crime in the past and are still angry or sad. They may be hiding how they feel and unwilling (or unable) to talk about their emotions. In addition, students may personally feel hate because they are angry at people who tease or harass them. They know they have to \"jus t stay here\" but are fearful of what might happen to them. ACTIVITY 4: IF NO ONE WILL LISTEN Module 16 Hate Crime 32 They may also feel they need to speak, but are afraid that no one will care about what they hav e to say. For example, if they decide to speak up about a bias-related crime, they may be concerned that school offi cials and other students will not take it seriously. Explain to students that in this case the chorus is saying that the Academic Coaches, Refugee Resettlement Case Managers, teachers, guidanc e counselors, and school administrators will be there for them and will like them for \"what they really are.\" Explain that \"after the bombs explode\" does not necessarily refer to real bombs, but to events that feel painf ul, and that victims of crim es often feel alone after a frightening event. If they feel that no one is listening to them (or caring about them) they can turn to any of the adul ts in the Refugee Academy for emotional support and guidance. Module 16 Hate Crime 33 If No One Will Listen Maybe no one told you there is strength in your tears And so you fight to keep from pouring out But what if you unlock the gate that keeps your secret soul Do you think there's enough that you would drown? No one can tell you where you alone must go There's no telling what you will find there And, God, I know the fear that eats away at your bones Screaming every step, \"just stay here\" If no one will listen If you decide to speak If no one's left standing a fter the bombs explode If no one wants to look at you For what you really are I will be here still If you find your fists are raw and red from beating yourself down If your legs have given out under the weight If you find you've been settli ng for a world of gray So you wouldn't have to face down your own hate If no one will listen If you decide to speak If no one's left standing a fter the bombs explode If no one wants to look at you For what you really are I will be here still. \u00a9 Kelly Clarkson, Keri Noble Module 16 Hate Crime 34 JOURNAL TOPIC Grades K-5, 6-9, 9-12 Who will I talk to if I witness or experience hate crime? What will I say? How can I inform my teachers and ot her students about my culture so that they appreciate and respect me? SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES \u0083 Invite school personnel and law enforcement officials who are familiar with bias-related crime to introduce themselves to the students. They can explain sa fe systems for reporting hate crime. \u0083 Invite non-refugee students to the Refugee Academy to share information about what they like to do, what they enjoy eating, how they spend time with their families, and what they enjoy about living in America. Stress th at everyone in the room is different and yet they all have sim ilar likes and dislikes. This is an opportunity for refugee studen ts to provide information, even if translation is needed, about who they are and what they are looking forward to in their new country. The visitors will become educated about differences and will hopefully build respect and appreciation. The instructor should frequently stop the class and ta lk about the importance of cultural tolerance and kindness. \u0083 Invite former refugee students to talk about what they like to do, what they enjoy eating, how they spend time with their families and what they enjoy about living in America. Ask them to talk about their exper iences with new students, how they handle bias comments, stressing the importance of talking to school personnel about concerns. \u0083 Show the DVDs and posters to class visitors.

Your teacher asks a question and the interp reter translates it. You know the answer! \"Raise your hand,\" the teacher says. Raise your hand? Why? Your teacher says, \"Line up, everyone, we are going to take turns on the swings on the playground.\" Line up ? What does that mean? Take turns ? How? What is a swing - and what happens on a playground ? These may be the thoughts of refugee students who have just arrived at American schools. The students may have had some exposure to schooling and the routine procedures of a classroom, such as lining up, raising your hand, working cooperatively in small groups, participating in \"circle time,\" and checking books out at the school library . But these standard procedures are often new and bewildering to most prim ary level refugee students. The following activities address the basics of adj usting to a classroom in American schools in grades kindergarten through second grade. T he Refugee Academy instructor and the Academic Coach can determine if the activities are necessary for the specific students enrolled in the Academy. All of the activities should be used in conj unction with the modules and Parent Programs in the Welcome to Our Schools curriculum. INTRODUCTION POSSIBLE CLASSROOM BEHAVIORS OF PRIMARY LEVEL REFUGEE CHILDREN Young refugee children can be enthusiastic about school and curious to learn about their new American life. They can be proud of their cultural traditions while adapting to American customs. Students in pre-school and grades K-2 may not remember the details of their lives in their home countries and look upon their new school wit h excitement. However, their emotional response to family trauma and resettlement ma y not be visible. Their anxieties about attending school can be similar to any child at tending school for the first time, compounded by lack of familiarity with the American school system in general. Most American children have participated in playgroups, child care, pre-school and/or pre- Kindergarten programs. For many primary level refugee ch ildren, the school is new \u2014 and so is the process of schooling. The followi ng behaviors may show up as young refugee children try to figure out how to navigate a syst em that can be rewarding and fun, but also discouraging and overwhelming. The basic strategies suggested can be used for any of the behaviors, and should be employed with all students, regardless of t heir level of adaptation. BEHAVIOR S UGGESTED STRATEGY Wandering Inattentive Separation anxiety Silent Fatigued Anxious Frustrated Depressed Establish a clear code of conduct; remind often Arrange for one-on-one focus; conduct sensory assessment (hearing, eyesight) Be familiar with siblings and relatives the student depends on Show school/classroom locations of relatives Don't push; assess speech; assign a helpful buddy Check for reasons, including full households, diet, emotional stress Provide a school-based comfort item for each child Begin with key English words that are used often in classrooms Assess sleeping patterns, diet, family loss in relatives, income, valuables Refer to psychologist, social worker, Refugee Resettlement Case Manager BEHAVIOR S UGGESTED STRATEGY Overwhelmed Fidgety Hitting, fighting Clinging to cultural identity Avoiding situations Impaired memory Exaggerated startle response Frequent health complaints Frequent social complaints Parallel (not interactive) play Masking feelings, insecurities Communicating in own language only Distracted by home life Erratic behavior Protective of teacher, peers Provide access to quiet space; practice walking school layout Involve student in games, movement; practice short stints of sitting Frequent counseling sessions about home life, school, behavior Encourage sharing of information; introduce new traditions slowly Repeat process for rest rooms, drinking fountain, locker room, playground to determine if avoidance is due to bullying, fear of darkness or noises Create predictive experiences, reminders, repetition, review Quick upbeat response; practice bells and drills before they occur Check for lead poisoning; consult with school nurse; determine if complaints are for attention or stress Assess for seasonal clothing and knowledge about dressing for the weather Assign pairs; model play, sharing, cooperation Organize cooperative learning, small group projects with assigned roles Establish a spot for personal belongings that is visible; reassure everyone Read and discuss picture books; praise use of new words by all students Provide a sense of community with class tasks, projects, routines, games Every day review the school day, routines, what will happen, expectations Provide leadership and class chore opportunities BEHAVIOR S UGGESTED STRATEGY Resistance to physical, eye contact Shyness, self-determined isolation Embarrassment Understand cultural and social norms; respect resistance; ease into contact Involve student in non-physical activities; assign \"important\" class duties to encourage distraction and pride in class participation Facilitate enrollment in clubs, sports, extracurricular activities Assess for hygiene; lunch items/money; clothing that fits; seasonal clothing Replace child as translator for parents with professional interpreter Recognize inexperience with changing clothes, interacting with other gender #1 G ETTING TO KNOW THE TEACHER Also see Module 1 American Schools For many primary level re fugee students, the Refugee Academy will be the first school they have experienced. They may be unsure about the t eacher, either because they have never experienced a classr oom setting, or they have heard about (or experienced) teachers who are more forma l than most teachers in American primary grades. This activity will assist student s in understanding that teachers are responsible for ensuring that st udents will learn, but that they are also caring individuals who look out fo r the welfare of their students. OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with the responsib ilities and personal interests of the classroom teacher, increasing their comfort level around teachers. SUPPLIES Large tote bag filled with instructional t ools and personal item s of the classroom teacher, to be shared with t he students. Examples are: lesson plan/grade book notebook paper pencils spiral notebook folders and other school supplies pens calendar textbooks construction paper scissors glue tape favorite snack lunch tissues personal fiction book 1 Primary Level Activities - #1 Getting to Know the Teacher children's book (to read aloud) something related a personal hobby of the teacher music CD, iPod DVD of a favorite movie umbrella cold weather clothing of the teacher Handout: Teacher's School Bag INSTRUCTIONS \u0088 The instructor should call attention to a lar ge, filled tote bag that is on a desk or table in the front of the room. \u0088 Explain that the classroom teacher has ma ny things to do during the day. Most teachers carry a bag, backpack, or briefcas e filled with the item s that they will need for their teaching. They br ing it to school every day. \u0088 Ask: What do you think I have in this big bag? Accept any responses. \u0088 Depending on the comfort level of t he students, the in structor can: \u0083 pull one item out of the bag and ask the children to talk about what it is and why the teacher might have it in the bag \u0083 ask a student to reach into the bag and pull something out - then discuss what it is and why the teac her might have it in the bag \u0088 The instructor should point out: \u0083 how the item is c onnected to teaching \u0083 how the item shows the personal interests of the teacher \u0083 how the teacher prepares for weather , lunch break, crafts, etc. \u0088 The instructor should pass the item around and encourage the students to ask questions about the item. \u0088 Point out examples of classroom word s that are associ ated with the item: \u0083 snack \u0083 book \u0083 notebook \u0083 pencil 2 Primary Level Activities - #1 Getting to Know the Teacher \u0088 Pause as the items are discussed, to: \u0083 read a story aloud \u0083 show how a pencil is used to write in a notebook \u0083 try on a winter hat \u0083 demonstrate using a tissue and throwing it away \u0083 explain that the iPod is used on the bus, but not in school \u0088 Demonstrate how to care for the items by, for example: \u0083 closing a book with a bookmark \u0083 packing up an unfinished lunch \u0083 sharpening a pencil \u0083 storing an iPod in a case pocket of the bag. \u0088 Ask individual students to identify the item that they like the best in the bag. Do not push students to say anything aloud - they c an point to the item - but review the word for the item and ask if they would like to explain why they chose a particular item. \u0088 Stress that the bag belongs to the teacher and should never be touched unless the teacher has given permission. Explain how the same rules are followed for the personal items of students. \u0088 Distribute the handout Teacher's School Bag for the students to color. They can draw additional items around the bag if a color copy of the handout has been distributed. \u0088 This activity can be carried out with other instructors and Academic Coaches so that students can get to know them a little better, too. \u0088 Ask the students what they know about the teacher's day, based on what is in the tote bag. \u0088 Ask the students to guess what will be used t hat day in school - then point out the item when it comes time to use it. For ex ample, there may be a picture book in the bag that is used for story time. Primary Level Activities - #1 Getting to Know the Teacher 3 Primary Level Activities - #1 Getting to Know the Teacher 4 #2 R AISE YOUR HAND! Also s ee Module 2 Making Friends When you want to be called on, y ou raise your hand. This is true in grades K-12, college, and sometimes at meetings on the job. Raising your hand to be called on is a new experience for most children entering school for the first ti me. It may be an entirely new concept for refugee children. They need to learn that t hey may be called on by the teacher at any time, but if they want to ask or answer a question, cont ribute to a discussion, ask for permission, or volunteer, then they are expe cted to raise their hand. This activity will give students opportunities to prac tice raising their hand in class. Poster: Raise Your Hand! (Available as part of the Welcome to Our Schools curriculum) Handouts: Boy Raising Hand Girl Raising Hand Students Raising Hands OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with t he routine of raising their hand in class and waiting for acknowledgement by the teacher before speaking. SUPPLIES 1 INSTRUCTIONS \u0088 The classroom should be arranged so that students can practice raising their hands during a large group discussion, circle time, and small group meetings with the Academic Coach and ot her instructors. \u0088 The instructor should point to the poster and discuss what the student is doing in the picture. Primary Level Activities - #2 Raise Your Hand! \u0088 The instructor should show the handout Boy Raising Hand and ask the boys to raise their hands the way the boy is raising hi s in the picture. Explain that students are supposed to raise their hand when they want to ask or answer a question. \u0088 The instructor should show the Handout Girl Raising Hand and ask the girls to raise their hands the way the girl raising hers in the picture. Repeat why students raise their hands. Explain that students also ra ise their hand when the teacher asks for volunteers (or asks who might be interest ed in helping the teacher or who might want to join in an activity.) \u0088 Show students the handout Students Raising Hands and explain that the class is going to practice raising their hand. \u0088 Point out that students don't have to raise thei r arms straight in the air every time they raise their hands. When they raise t heir hand they shouldn't wave their arm, make noises, or keep their hand up when the teacher has called on someone else. (Adults in the classroom can role-play raising their hand in class.) \u0088 Begin practicing, praising students as they raise their hands in response to the questions. \u0088 Practice with questions that everyone can answer by raising their hands: \u0083 Raise your hand if you are sitting at a desk. \u0083 Raise your hand if you are wearing shoes. \u0083 Raise your hand if you like to play games . \u0088 Then switch to questions that provide student s with a choice as to whether to raise their hand: \u0083 Raise your hand if you like rice. \u0083 Raise your hand if you have brown hair. \u0083 Raise your hand if you like to play soccer. \u0088 Practice in different settings, such as duri ng circle time, in classrooms, and in small group sessions with the Academic C oach and other instructors. \u0088 Continue practicing with additional question s, without instructing students to raise their hand. For example: \u0083 Who would like to sit in the front of the room? \u0083 Who would like to get a book from the bookshelf? \u0083 Is there anyone who would like to show us the picture that we drew this morning? 2 Primary Level Activities - #2 Raise Your Hand! \u0088 The instructor should make a point of reminding students who forget that they should raise their hand before speaking. Students who are quiet and do not speak or raise their hand at all should be call ed on even if they did not raise their hand. Students can then see that the teacher calls on everyone in the class at some time or another. \u0088 Post the handouts around the room so that students can see them. 3 Primary Level Activities - #2 Raise Your Hand! 4 Primary Level Activities - #2 Raise Your Hand! 5 Primary Level Activities - #2 Raise Your Hand! 6 Primary Level Activities - #2 Raise Your Hand! #3 L EARNING TO LINE UP Also s ee Module 1 American Schools A standard procedure in Americ an schools is lining up to move to another classroom. Student s line up to walk the halls, enter or leave a class, exit t he building, and buy lunch in the cafeteria. Although most re fugee students will be generally familiar with the concept of lining up, they may not understan d the system and appropriate behaviors associated with lining up. This activity will give them a fun opportunity to practice lining up. Instructors should keep in mind that this acti vity involves tracing the student's body on a large piece of paper. Some students ma y feel uncomfortable having their body traced; the instructor can sketch the body shape on a large piece of paper taped on the floor or wall next to each of the students. Every student should have a paper cutout of themselves. OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with the procedure of lining up in school. SUPPLIES Rolls of butcher paper cut into pieces t hat are the approximate size of the students Crayons or markers Black or navy wide-point marker Space for students to lie down so that they can be traced on the butcher paper Scissors for students (optional) Crayons or markers Black or navy wide-point marker Handout: Figure Coloring Page Primary Level Activities - #3 Learning to Line Up 1 Primary Level Activities - #3 Learning to Line Up 2 INSTRUCTIONS \u0088 The instructor should distribute the handout Figure Coloring Page and ask the students to color a picture of themselv es. They can add face and hair, shoes, clothing, or anything else that they believe depicts their appearance. They can also add items around the dr awing that show their interests and activities. \u0088 If the students have already had some school experience, ask them to describe situations when they are expected to line up in school. \u0088 Explain the line-up procedure in the classroom: \u0083 A line leader is usually designated by t he teacher; this is often considered an honor. \u0083 Everyone should face forward. \u0083 There should be a space between each person. \u0083 When walking, they should keep the space between students. \u0083 The students should be quiet when in line, especially when walking through the hallways. \u0083 There should be no touching anyone else in the line (poking, hitting, etc.). \u0083 The students should be watching the teacher for signals about stopping, turning, quiet, etc. \u0083 Students can acknowledge friends w ho are passing by the line with a wave or a smile, but should not talk or move out of the li ne to greet them. \u0083 Students should pay attention to where they are going in case they have to go there by themselves in the futu re (e.g., main office, lunch room, nurse's office). \u0083 Students should stay in the line when waiting in hallways or when entering and exiting a new classr oom, gymnasium, or playground. \u0083 Students should respond to the playgr ound whistle or announcement to \"line up\" to go back inside. (Note: instructors may want to practice this because some refugee students may be c oncerned that the whistle is a signal of a problem.) \u0088 The instructor should ask the students to hol d their pictures in front of themselves and line up one a time. The students can practi ce \"walking\" their pictures around the room, keeping in a line. \u0083 Explain that the students may be asked to line up for teams in gym class. \u0083 Explain that the \"buddy\" system is when students line up in pairs. \u0088 Lay out the pieces of butcher paper and tr ace students so that they each get their own paper \"person.\" \u0088 Ask students to color the large drawings. They can copy the small handout drawing or create an entirely new image of themselves. \u0088 The instructor should tell the students to begin with the faces so that everyone has at least completed that part of the picture. \u0088 Optional: When the large drawings are comple ted, the students can cut out the figures. (This should be done if the instructor feels that the students are comfortable using scissors.) \u0088 The instructor should ask the children to line up again, one at a time. This time they will be carrying their large figures and will practice walkin g their figures down the hall and into other school settings. By walkin g their figures through the school, they are pretending to show the figures how to walk in the school in line and are giving the figures a \"tour.\" \u0088 Although the walk around the school will also assist st udents in becoming oriented to the building, the purpose of the activity is to practice walking appropriately in a line. \u0088 Upon returning to the classroom, place the figures in the seats (or around the room) and practice walking in line through t he school again (without the figures). \u0088 Continue practicing lining up, even when t he class is not leaving the room for another activity. Keep reviewing the procedures fo r lining up. \u0088 Rotate line leaders to give students the pr ivilege of leading the class, and to help line leaders build confidence in under standing the layout of the school. Primary Level Activities - #3 Learning to Line Up 3 Primary Level Activities - #3 Learning to Line Up 4 #4 T AKING TURNS Also s ee Module 5 So Much to Learn One of the biggest adjustments children have to make when they enter school is the process of taking turns. Unless they have participated in a structur ed preschool program, they are more than likely used to i ndependent or paralle l play, or informal group activities. The children may have experienced waiting for their turn, but during the school day they are taking turns all day long. In this activity the students will become expo sed to a variety of re cess activities while learning how to take turns. The instructor and the Academic Coach should select recess activities that will be routinely c onducted in the local school whether on an asphalt playground, in a gymnas ium, or in a classroom. Instructors should keep in mind that refugee students, particularly t hose in the primary grades, may have minimal experience with pl aying with a ball, climbing on a jungle gym or slide, swinging on a playground swing, or even walking on a si dewalk or trail. They may not understand the concept of taki ng turns and will have to be gently guided to wait until they can try the activity. Even recess periods that allow students to move from activity to ac tivity at their own discretion require taking turns occasiona lly Refugee students will need to know that barging into the middle of an activity will be disruptive and ma y annoy the other students. At the beginning of every recess peri od (or play time) take a few minutes to practice taking turns. The instructor and Academic Coach should dem onstrate every recess activity first, regardless of how basic it may seem. OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with standard recess activities while practicing taking turns. 1 Primary Level Activities - #4 Taking Turns SUPPLIES Equipment used for recess ac tivities. Examples are: \u0083 swings \u0083 slide \u0083 ball to toss into a basket \u0083 ball to roll or kick \u0083 jump rope \u0083 Frisbee \u0083 two items to balance (e.g., plastic plate and apple) \u0083 line or balance beam \u0083 tunnel, bases, ropes, or other physical education resources 2 INSTRUCTIONS \u0088 Instructors should prepare t he play areas in advance, keeping in mind that the purpose of the activity is to give students the opportunity to prac tice taking turns. The tasks should be easy to accomplish. \u0088 The students can line up behind different play areas, or can follow each other in one line from one play area to the next. (The process will be determined by the number of adults who can assi st students in taking turns.) \u0088 The instructor should demonstrate a signal that will be used to tell students when it is their turn (pointing at the student, raising arm in air, etc.). \u0088 The instructor should keep reinforcing taking turns by lining students up and sending the signal when the next student can go ahead. \u0088 As a follow-up to the activity, the students can practice taking turns in the classroom: \u0083 serving as line leader \u0083 sitting near the teacher \u0083 lining up \u0083 choosing a book \u0083 coming to the teacher's desk \u0083 selecting a handout, pencil, etc. Primary Level Activities - #4 Taking Turns \u00ae #5 L ISTENING AT CIRCLE TIME Also s ee Module 1 American Schools Most primary level instruction includes an activity called \"circle time\" when students gather around the teacher, sitting on the floor or on chairs. As refugee students become accustomed to sitting quietly at a desk, they may not realize that circle time is more informal, but the same classroom rules apply. They are still expected to sit quietly, listen, raise their hands, take turns, etc. During this activity the students not only practice good behavior during ci rcle time, they also learn how to listen with their entire bodies (ears, eyes , mouth, hands, feet, seat, and brain). OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with the rules of cl assroom circle time and will practice listening with their entire bodies. SUPPLIES Circle time area Large rug or mat - or individual carpet squares Cueing signal for gathering in a circle (song, picture, lights flickering, teacher going to chair in the center of the circle, etc.) Musical instruments such as a tambourine, maraca, or triangle (as an example of a possible activity during circle time) Picture books with large, easily visible illustrations (as an example of a possible activity during circle time) Simple science or math item, such as ru ler, fish bowl, potted plant, abacus (as examples of possible demonstr ations during circle time) Healthy food (as an example of a possi ble discussion topic during circle time) Large picture (as an example of a possibl e discussion topic during circle time) Handouts: Circle Time Circle Time Coloring Page Primary Level Activities - #5 Listening at Circle Time 1 \u0088 The instructor should use a cueing si gnal, explaining that when the students hear/ see the signal they are to gather in a circle for circle time. \u0088 Describe the steps to circle time, practicing each step one at a time: \u0083 Walk quietly to the circle area and sit down. \u0083 Instructors may specify any of the following: \u0080 one row at a time \u0080 collect a carpet square to sit on \u0080 move chairs \u0080 sit in the front row first \u0080 sit next to your buddy \u0083 Make sure that hands and feet are not touching anyone else in the circle. \u0083 Always face the teacher. \u0088 Once students have practiced settling into a circle, begin the circle activity right away so that the students will not get restless. Hold up the handout Circle Time and discuss the activities that might take place during circle time. \u0088 Provide short examples of each possible circle time activity: \u0083 Story time (sample storybooks) \u0083 Music (musical instrument) \u0083 Demonstrations (science, math items) \u0083 Discussions (healthy food, picture) \u0088 Remind students that the rules of circle time are the same as when they are sitting at their desks (raise hands , take turns, etc.). \u0088 The instructor should demonstrate how t he students will be listening during circle time with their whole bodies : \u0083 eyes (watching the teacher) \u0083 ears (leaning forward and fo cusing on the teacher) \u0083 mouth (staying quiet unless called upon by the teacher) \u0083 hands (raising hand to speak; not bothering others in the circle) INSTRUCTIONS Primary Level Activities - #5 Listening at Circle Time 2 \u0083 feet (not stretching, kicking, taking up too much space) \u0083 seat (remaining in the circle time spot) \u0083 brain (concentrating on learning the information discussed during circle time) \u0088 Repeat the steps to listeni ng with the whole body, asking students to demonstrate how they are listening in circle time. \u0088 If the students are still able to continue sitting quietly, a quick story should be read to them (or a story told aloud by the teacher). \u0088 Explain how the students should leave circle time and move on to the next activity (line up, return to seats, etc.). \u0088 Distribute the handout Circle Time Coloring Page and ask the students what they think the group and the teacher are discussing. Are the students following classroom rules? Students can color t he picture and add additional items on the easel and around the circle. \u0088 The instructor should repeat circle time of ten so that the process becomes familiar to the refugee students and they are comfortable with t he rules and activities. Primary Level Activities - #5 Listening at Circle Time 3 Primary Level Activities - #5 Listening at Circle Time 4 Primary Level Activities - #5 Listening at Circle Time 5 #6 W HAT'S IN YOUR CLASSROOM ? Also s ee Module 1 American Schools Primary-level classrooms are usually filled with decorated bulletin boards, walls covered in posters, chalkboards with pictures and signs, learning stations, and bookshelves filled with toys, art supplies and books. Some classrooms even have cubbies overflowing with student belongings, easels and tables covered with art pr ojects, and mobiles hanging from the ceiling. The rooms are colorful and st imulating, but often overw helming for students who have never seen a school before. There are many things to see and absorb, a variety of choices, and multiple opport unities to try new things. It can be exciting but bewilder ing at the same time. In this activity refugee students will have t he opportunity to become familiar with the variety of materials in thei r classroom. They will learn w here various resources are located and how they are used. The activity may seem very simple - to find something in a classroom - but it will assist refugee students in identifying the many components of the classroom, rather than becoming overwhelmed with the overall image. Marching music for students to march to as they explore the classroom The instructor can take photographs in advan ce of different areas of the classroom, such as those listed below in the Handout s section. The photographs can be printed or can be displayed on a computer as the students carry out this activity. OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with the variety of resources in a primary-level classroom and where those resour ces are located. SUPPLIES Primary Level Activities - #6 W hat's in Your Classroom? 1 Handouts: (Select the handout s that apply to the Refugee Academy classroom) Books Puzzles Art supplies Teacher's desk Pencils Computers Exit sign Bulletin board Blackboard Clock Pencil sharpener Backpack 2 \u0088 The instructors can begin this activity by doing a quick tour of the classroom, pointing out all of the res ources, learning centers, pl ay areas, etc. The students may have difficulty absorbing the informati on. The purpose is to give a brief overview and explain to the students that they are going to get to know their classroom. \u0088 The instructor should start the marching music and the students should practice marching in place. The instructor then turn s the music off, holds up a picture of where the students should go next, then turns the music back on so that the students can march to the area. This process is repeated as the students walk to various points in the room. \u0088 The instructor can show photographs of t he actual classroom, or use the handouts provided. Additional pictures can be displayed, dependi ng on what is in the classroom. (Note: Since all classrooms are different, not all of the handout pictures will apply to the Refugee Academy classroom.) \u0088 The instructor and the Academic Coach c an lead the students to the spot in the room that the instructor has mentioned, or can wait to see if the students can figure it out. After each location is found, the in structor can show how the resources are used in that part of the classroom. INSTRUCTIONS Primary Level Activities - #6 W hat's in Your Classroom? 3 \u0088 As a follow up to the activity, the students re turn to their seats and the instructor invites two students to come to the front of the room. The instructor holds up a picture and the pair of student s work together to show the rest of the class where that spot is located in the classroom. The class c an help them, if necessary. The instructor and students can add additional \"I Spy\" items in the classroom. (Individual students should not be asked to do this unless it is clear that everyone is familiar with the room.)

Also s ee Module 2 Making Friends At the early primary level, children start to build relationships and learn about the qualities of a good friend. Most refugee students are eager to make friends in their new school, but do not necessarily know how to build friendships. They may not be able to discern between a true friendship a nd someone who is pretending to be friendly for the purpose of taking advantage of them (e.g., teasing to embarrass them, setting them up to do something unsaf e or illegal; taking money from them, recruiting for a gang, etc.). Classroom activities should provide opportuniti es for socialization and the development of new positive relationships. Some of t he refugee students may have lost friends in their home countries or left them behind when they relocated. Emphasis in this activity should be on how to make new friends in the Refugee Academy and in school. Photographs of instructor and/or Academic Coach with a friends Handouts: Lots of Friends! Fun in the Rain with a Friend Helping a Friend Playing a Game with a Friend Talking to a Friend Friends Around the World OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with the elements of a positive friendship. SUPPLIES INSTRUCTIONS \u0088 The instructor and the Academic Coach should show the photographs of themselves with friends and talk about why they are friends with the people in the photos. Primary Level Activities - #7 Who is Your Friend? 1 \u0088 The instructor should discuss the definiti on of \"friend\" with the students, stressing the characteristics of a positive friendship. \u0088 The instructor should hold up each handout , one at a time, and ask the students how they can tell that the people in the picture are fri ends. For each handout, point out that good friends are: \u0083 helpful \u0083 kind \u0083 willing to share \u0083 polite \u0083 supportive \u0088 The instructor should explain that friends do not: \u0083 distract you from getting your work done \u0083 encourage you to break the rules \u0083 keep you from socializing (playi ng, working) wit h other students \u0083 pressure you to do things that you don't want to do \u0083 hurt your feelings. \u0088 Ask: What can you do to show that you know how to be a good friend? (The instructor should demonstrate a fr iendly greeting and offer to share a book with another adult in the classroom.) Additional ways that the teacher can ro le play or the students can show how to be a good friend: \u0083 Help set up a toy or put toys away \u0083 Offer to assist in getting work done, with the teacher's permission \u0083 Approach someone who looks lonely \u0083 Save a place at lunch \u0083 Choose another student as a buddy \u0083 Explain an assignment \u0083 Ask how another student is feeling after being sick \u0083 Apologize for accidentally breaking a toy Primary Level Activities - #7 Who is Your Friend? 2 \u0088 The instructor should enc ourage each student to say Hi! to someone else in the class as a friendly greeting. (The instructor should arrange this so that everyone gets a chance to greet and everyone gets greeted.) \u0088 The instructor can then divide the students into pairs or groups of three and ask them to find a quiet pl ace in the room and: \u0083 tell each other their names \u0083 describe a food that they have enjoy ed (at any time in their lives) \u0083 choose a book to look at together (or toy to play with). \u0088 This activity can be repeated often so t hat students will have the chance to greet each other and make new friends. \u0088 Display the handout Friends Around the World and explain that students in the Refugee Academy and in American schools can be friends. \u0088 Students can draw a picture of students who are behaving like good friends (similar to the handouts). \u0088 Instructors may want to connect this activity with Module 15 Staying Safe in the Welcome to Our Schools curriculum, and Activity #17 Safe in the Neighborhood included in this Supplemental Primary Level (K-2) packet of activities.

The purpose of cooperative lear ning is to assist students in building skills in communication, leadership, problem-solving, and, of course, cooperation. In this activity, groups of four students will work together to complete a four-piece jigsaw puzzle after the separate pieces have been colored by the students. Putting puzzles together is a crucial early learni ng skill because it involves spatial relations, logic and problem-solving, patterning, and a sense of achievement. Working on puzzles can be a significant stress relie ver, particularly if friends help out. Many refugee students may be experiencing jigsaw puzzles for the first time in the Refugee Academy. They will need to underst and the concepts of putting shapes together, matching colors and designs, and cr eating a whole image from pieces. In this activity, the students will have the oppor tunity to make new friends as they work cooperatively to solve a problem. Crayons or markers Decorative items (beads, glitte r, embroidery thread, ribbons) Glue or glue stick Blank 8\u00bd x 11 paper for mounting a completed puzzle (\"background\" paper) Optional: Children's scissors (if the students will be cutting out the puzzle pieces) Optional: Boxes of puzzles ranging in difficulty Optional: Classroom puzzle table reserved for working on jigsaw puzzles Handouts: Puzzle Pieces (four pages) Children with Puzzle Coloring Page OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with a simple ji gsaw puzzle and cooperate to put the puzzle together. SUPPLIES Primary Level Activities - #8 Putting a Puzzle Together (Cooperative Learning) 1 INSTRUCTIONS \u0088 The instructor should determine if the student s are able to cut out the puzzle pieces on the handout Puzzle Pieces (four pages). If not, then the pieces have to be cut out by the instructor and clipped together. (Each group wil l receive a set of 4 puzzle pieces.) \u0088 The instructor should divide the students into groups of four. \u0083 If the group is not evenly divided by four, some students may be able to work on more than one piece of the puzzle. Others may share a piece and work on it together. \u0083 As groups are divided, the instruct or should keep in mind that the activity is designed for cooperativ e learning and build ing friendships. \u0088 Each group receives the handout Puzzle Pieces (four pages) . \u0088 Each student cuts out one of the puzzle pieces and beg ins decorating it. Remind students that they cannot change the shape of their puzzle piece. \u0088 The instructor should establish a time frame for decorating. \u0088 Once the pieces are decorated, the group of four children should cooperate in putting their puzzle together and placing it on the background paper. For some students, the process will we be obvious. For others, the arrangement of the pieces will be a challenge. \u0088 The instructor should stress t hat the students should all take turns, help each other, and decide together how they want to place the completed puzzle on the background paper (e.g., landscape, portrait, crooked). \u0088 Once the small group has arranged the puzzl e, they should glue it to the background paper. (The instructor may need to remind th e students about the proper use of glue.) \u0088 The completed puzzles can be displayed in the room. 2 Primary Level Activities - #8 Putting a Puzzle Together (Cooperative Learning) \u0088 The instructor should distribute the handout Children with Puzzle Coloring Page and discuss how well the groups cooperated to put together a puzzle. Stress the positive behaviors that were observed. If there were problems, discuss how conflicts can be resolved (or how the pr oblems were solved by the group). \u0088 If additional puzzles are available, encourage the students to work on puzzles when they have free time and need to concentrate on something that is challenging and fun. 3 Primary Level Activities - #8 Putting a Puzzle Together (Cooperative Learning) 4 Primary Level Activities - #8 Putting a Puzzle Together (Cooperative Learning) 5 Primary Level Activities - #8 Putting a Puzzle Together (Cooperative Learning) 6 Primary Level Activities - #8 Putting a Puzzle Together (Cooperative Learning) 7 Primary Level Activities - #8 Putting a Puzzle Together (Cooperative Learning) 8 Primary Level Activities - #8 Putting a Puzzle Together (Cooperative Learning) #9 K EEPING ORGANIZED Beginning in the primary gr ades, students are responsible for assignments to complete, papers to save, and worksheets and notes to take home, and papers to save. It is often confusing for students to keep track of all of the papers, even when teachers take the time to help students stay organized. For refugee students, the amount of paperwo rk can be especially overwhelming. In this activity students will create their fi rst system for keeping organized in school. They will decorate a pocket folder that will remain in their desk (the Academy folder) and another folder for their backp ack (the Home folder). Papers that are supposed to go home should go in the folder in the backpack. All other papers can stay in the Academy folder. It is important for instructors and Academic Coaches to take extra time to make sure that the studen ts are filing the papers in the correct folders and are keeping the folders neat. The students may have difficulty and may need constant monitoring, but the purpose of the activity is to help refugee students to realize that they should try to stay organized. The folder system is one way to manage all of the paperwork. It also encourages students to develop the habit of bringing papers back and forth between school and home. If the instructor follows this system ca refully, student stress should be reduced, communication with families should improv e, and students will have evidence of their accomplishments in the program. Note that if the primary grades in the school district have specific organizational syst ems, the instructor should try to replicate those systems as closely as possible. Some school s require particular binders or folders that all students must use in school. OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with storing school papers in an organized system. SUPPLIES Two pocket folders per student, labeled with the name of the st udent. (The best system will be to use one color for the Academy fol der and one color for the Home folder.) 1 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized Also s ee Module 9 Study Skills Supplies for decorating the folders, such as crayons, markers, stickers, pictures, glue Paperwork for the folders, if appropriate, su ch as notes for parents, completed work, worksheets and coloring pages to complete at home, etc. (See Handouts) Handouts for the cove r of the folders: \u0083 Home \u0083 School Handouts for the Home folder: \u0083 Getting to School \u0083 School Subjects \u0083 K-5 \u0083 School School-Home Communication After School Activities (K-5) \u0083 Academic Coach Information \u0083 Sample Notes for Illness \u0083 Sample Late Notes INSTRUCTIONS \u0088 The instructor should provide students with two folders, labeled with the names of the students. \u0088 The students can copy their names and decor ate their folders to make them their own. They should place the Home handout picture (choose Home or Apartment) on one folder and the School handout picture on the second folder. \u0088 Instruct the students how to file the paper s. The HOME folder should go back and forth from school to home in the backpack. \u0088 Handouts for parents are provided in this activity, as well as in the Welcome to Our Schools Parent Programs. The instructor should distribute a new handout each day, explaining to the students that they should give the HOME folder to their parents and then bring it back to t he Refugee Academy every day. (The handouts should also be reviewed with parents during conferences or Refugee Academy Parent Programs.) \u0088 The instructor may have additional papers available for the students to take home or store at school. The inst ructor should inform the stud ents how to file their papers in the folders. This process should be repeat ed every time there is a paper that the students need to keep or take home. 2 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized 3 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized 4 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized 5 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized 6 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized 7 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized 8 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized 9 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized 10 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized 11 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized 12 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized 13 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized 14 Primary Level Activities - #9 Keeping Organized #10 C LASSROOM JOBS Also s ee Module 4 School Rules Most elementary school classrooms have lists of jobs for the students to complete every day. A chart is usually posted, and every week the students are a ssigned to different tasks. The jobs may include straightening the books, feeding the class pets, erasing the board, or putting away the toys. In addition, every student is expected to a ssist in keeping the classroom neat. If the environment is neat and organized, the students are not as easily distracted. The students learn to take pride in thei r classroom and can even earn rewards for completing their jobs. Empty classroom wastebasket One or two pieces of scrap paper per student that can be crumpled and thrown out (Note: Select paper that is clearly scrap paper so that students understand that they are not throwing out fresh pieces of paper . If the school has a recycling system, use the appropriate basket for collecting recycled paper.) Music to play while children are doing the classroom jobs OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with typical cl assroom jobs and develop pride in completing the jobs and keeping the classroom neat. SUPPLIES 1 INSTRUCTIONS The instructor should put the classroom wastebasket on top of a table or the instructor's desk. Ask: What is this for? Give each student a piece of scrap paper t hat can be tossed in the wastebasket. Primary Level Activities - #10 Classroom Jobs Ask them to crumple up the paper and line up to take turns throwing the paper into the wastebasket. The instructor should be part of the line, intentionally miss the basket, and continue walking. If a student picks up the paper, the instructor should praise the student and point out how important it is to work together to keep the classroom clean. Remind students that whenever they \"shoot\" for the baske t they should pick up any paper that misses. Otherwise, the in structor should pick up the paper and emphasize how waste is thrown in the baske t. Explain that there are rules that require people not to \"litter\" outdoors or indoors. Whenever students \"shoot\" for a basket, they should pick up any paper that misses. Ask students to straighten it ems on their desks and tidy up their belongings in a desk or in a cubby. Select the jobs that are available in the Refugee Ac ademy classroom and divide the students into pairs to complete the jobs. Examples of jobs are: straighten books on the bookshelf sort and store toys and puzzles straighten rows of desks and loose chairs in the classroom water plants feed class pets straighten circle time area organize a bulletin board. Demonstrate each job so that stu dents can see what is expected. Give students a limited amount of time to complete their jobs. Encourage the students to help each other and look for othe r tasks that they can do to make the classroom neat. (Play music while the students work.) Point out how it is easier to get cl ass work done when the room is neat and organized. 2 Primary Level Activities - #10 Classroom Jobs #11 C REATING COMFORT TO REDUCE STRESS Also s ee Module 14 Coping with Stress This activity should be discussed with school social workers and psychologists involved in the Refugee Academy program before it is implemented. The first few days of the Refugee Academy can be fun and exciting for young students, but also scary and stressful. Children who are nervous or scared can often find comfort by holding a soft blanket, stuffed animal, or toy. Although bringing these items to school is usually discouraged (even in kindergarten), instru ctors in the Refugee Academy may want to provide young refugees with a \"comfort item\" to keep with them for t he duration of the Academy. A comfort item is usually something small t hat can be carried in a pocket or backpack. Students may reach for the item when they are feeling anxi ous, or when it is a quiet time in the class and they are encouraged to relax. For example, students may take out their comfort item during st ory time or circle time, or when the class is preparing for a transition to a new activity. Comfort items have been shown to be significant ly helpful to students in transition. If the items are viewed as a temporary source of stress reduction, students will eventually discover that they don't need them. Instructors can introduce them if it appears that students will benefit, and t hen gradually encourage students to experience new activities in the Refugee Academy without calling on the comfort item for solace. It is up to the instructor and colleagues to det ermine if a comfort it em is appropriate in the Refugee Academy. They ma y prefer that st udents try other strategies and seek help before relying on a comfort item. (See Module 7 Coping with Stress for suggestions.) The instructor and the Academic Coach may feel that it is confusing to the student to provide a comfort item that can be used in t he Academy but not in school. And students may discover that older siblings tease them about the comfort item, so it may be necessary to keep the item at the site of the Refugee Academy. Some students may not need the item at all. Some may misplace it or give it away. It may be taken away from a child by a parent, si bling, or another studen t. It is important Primary Level Activities - #11 Creating Comfort to Reduce Stress 1 Optional: The picture book Owen - by Kevin Henkes (New York: Greenwillow Books, 1993) - This book shows Owen (a mouse) and his fuzzy yellow blanket and tells how it provides him with comfort. But Owen cannot bring the blanket to school, so Owen's mother makes a blanket square into a handkerchief. Comfort item for each child, such as: 4\"x 4\" flannel fabric swatches, easily washable by hand, available at fabric/quilting stores small toy small stuffed animal (easily washable) book Optional: puppets Some of these items may be donated and shoul d be checked for safety. For example, check for small parts and lead because of possible lead poisoning. Younger siblings may handle the items. Contact the New York State Department of Health, Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (518)402-7600) for informati on about specific toys. to establish a system in the Refugee Acade my classroom to prevent loss of the comfort item. (It may also be necessary to set up systems for keeping the comfort items clean.) One of the best ways to provide comfort is to give eac h student a paperback book that they get to keep as their own. They can sele ct from a shelf of boo ks or the instructor can determine the most appropriate book fo r each child. The students can take out their book whenever it appears that a quiet time of comfort is required. At the same time they are developing an appreciation of li terature as a source of comfort. After discussing the use of comfort items wit h colleagues, the instructor can determine whether the items would useful in the Refugee Academy. This activity provides suggestions for introducing a comfort item and for encouraging students to use the item to reduce stress. OBJECTIVE Students will understand how a comfort item is a source of stress reduction during the Refugee Academy and at home, but ma y not be allowed in school. SUPPLIES 2 Primary Level Activities - #11 Creating Comfort to Reduce Stress The instructor can distribute the comfor t items and ask the children to experience their texture, color, and other details. The instructor and the Academic Coach c an role-play how a student might be feeling anxious and will reach for the comfort item. (This can also be done with puppets.) The instructor can read the picture book Owen, explaining that the student may not be able to bring the comfort item to school, espec ially if it is a toy or stuffed animal. Explain that the comfort item (toy, stuff ed animal, flannel square, book) should be in a safe place and will be taken out when the in structor tells the st udents to get it. Explain that sometimes the instructor will encourage a student to get their comfort item if it appears that they need it. Ask: Where will you keep your toy (stuffed animal, flannel squar e, special book)? When will you be able to take it out? Role-play one student comfor ting another student who is stressed. Ask students how they can calm down if they feel nervo us or upset. Provide suggestions such as playing with a friend, talking to an adult, or working on a project such as coloring or putting a puzzle together. INSTRUCTIONS 3 Primary Level Activities - #11 Creating Comfort to Reduce Stress #12 Q UIET TIME Also s ee Module 9 Study Skills Most primary grades have a \" quiet time\" when students are expected to work without talking, either at their desk or in a reading corner or learning center . For many students this is difficult because they enjoy soci alizing and may have difficulty staying on task when they are doi ng an activity by themselves. For some refugee students, the quiet time is a welcome relief from the constant noise and activity of an American school. They may be feeling overwhelmed and need a few minutes of quiet. If they ar e expected to be silent during quiet time, then they are not pressured to try to communicate, follow what is going on, and connect with other children. Teachers in primary grades use quiet time to help students concentrate and learn how to work independently. In the Refugee Academy, it will be necessary to show the students what they can do during quiet ti me. The length of quiet time can be determined by the instructor and is based on the age and school experience of the ref- ugee students. Quiet time activities set up around the room, such as: independent games and puzzles reading center coloring pages and other worksheets for students to complete art supplies to take back to the desk music and media centers with headphones computer station Optional: Soft music OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with how to work independently during class quiet time. SUPPLIES 1 Primary Level Activities - #12 Quiet Time INSTRUCTIONS The instructor should wait until all of the students are quiet. Explain that the students are going to have a short period of time to work quietly by themselves. There will be no talking unless they have to ask the teacher a question. Demonstrate the teacher's si gnal for quiet, such as holding the index finger up to the lips or raising a hand in the air. The instructor should show the students the choices around the room for quiet time activities. The students can take a minute to select an activity and then quiet down. If students are going to be sharin g a play area, it is impo rtant that they are not permitted to choose toys and games that wi ll involve other students, such as dress-up, board games, etc. The purpose is to help pr imary-level students become comfortable with independen t, quiet activities. Extend the length of quiet time as students become comfort able working alone. 2 Primary Level Activities - #12 Quiet Time #13 B OOKS ! Also s ee Module 6 So Much to Learn and Module 7 Interests and Talents One of the first things that refugee students notice about their classrooms is that there is color everywhere - on the walls, bulletin boards, teacher's clot hing, and rugs. The students also comment on the number of books available for free reading at any time. Some refugee students have never experienced selecting and holding a book, flipping the pages, and stud ying the pictures. Others have used books before, but are often surpris ed by the extensive libraries in the schools and the number of books and textbooks in the classroom. (They are also often amazed by how heavy the books are in their backpacks!) Younger refugee students will be introduced to t he many different kinds of books once they enter school. They will eventually learn the diffe rence between fiction and non- fiction, picture books and chapter books. They will also learn how to check out a book at the library. This Refugee Academy activity focuses on becoming aware of the sheer variety of reading material available in schools. Some schools will have extensive collections in a school library and in classrooms, while ot hers will have limited re sources that students can use. Regardless of the number and condition of the books, refugee students should have the opportunity to see what is av ailable in their school and in their local library, online, and in bookstores. OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with a full range of books that are available for free in school and local libraries, and for purchase online and in bookstores.

Explain how to handle books: keep books clean don't fold pages use bookmarks turn pages carefully (left to right) Pass the books around for the students to l ook through. Ask them to identify pictures or pages that they find particularly interesting. (This is a good opportunity for students to practice raising their hand.) The instructor should make it very clear that the students are not expected to know how to read the books. The students are becoming awar e of the full range of books 2 Primary Level Activities - #13 Books! that are available to them. The instruct or should explain that some books require reading skills that they will learn in school, and that everyone learns how to read at a different pace. The instructor can point out: personal book favorites books that they found interesting books that were hard to read but enjoyable favorite authors books that were purchased at a store, used book sale, online Explain that there are books written about nearly everything. Hold up the handout Girl Reading . Ask: What do you think that this girl is reading about? (Any answer is correct.) Hold up the handouts Boy Reading and Girl with Glasses Reading and ask the same question. Ask: What would y ou like to read about? If there are books in the cl assroom, point out their location and the rules about bor- rowing books to read. Encour age the students to select a book. (If a classroom li- brary is not available, students can select from a stack of books that the instructor has gathered. See Supplies.) Post the handout Choosing a Book . Discuss the system for selecting a book at the school library, checking out the book, and returning it on time. Ask: What is the girl reading about and do you think she will choose that book? If possible, take a tour of the school or public library, obtain library cards (or learn the school check-out system), and borrow a book. Distribute card stock bookmarks and cray ons for students to use when they start reading their books. 3 Primary Level Activities - #13 Books! 6 Primary Level Activities - #13 Books! 8 Primary Level Activities - #13 Books! 7 Primary Level Activities - #13 Books! 5 Primary Level Activities - #13 Books! 4 Primary Level Activities - #13 Books! 9 Primary Level Activities - #13 Books! 10 Primary Level Activities - #13 Books! #14 F AVORITE SCHOOL ACTIVITIES Also s ee Module 7 Interests and Talents and Mini-Academy Activity #11 Note: This activity should be conducted after refugee students have had exposure to the variety of activities that occur in American schools. During the Refugee Academy re fugee students will have the opportunity to experience activities that ma y occur during the school day. If time and space permit during the Academy, the students will participate in large and small group learning experiences, playground and gymnasium games, snack and lunch breaks, and art and music activities. They will become familiar with the school building and will learn where to store their belongings, how to use the restrooms, and what after-school options are available. As refugee students in the primary grades begin to und erstand what happens during a school day in America, they will start to identify their favo rite activities. Handout: School Activities Grid (three pages, including one page with empty grid squares) Additional School Activities Grid handout (all three pages) cut into squares (for demonstration) Optional follow-up handout 7-1 What Do You Enjoy? from Section C: Handouts (for discussing extracu rricular activities) and Mi ni-Academy, Activity #11 Look What I Can Do!

If the student s have participated in the activities, the instructor should ask the students to descr ibe what happens during the activity. \u0088 Ask:: \u0083 Where do we do this activity? \u0083 What do we use when we do this activity? \u0083 Can someone show me where these cr ayons (books, games, etc.) are in the classroom? \u0088 Some of the activities ma y not be depicted exactly as they occur in the Refugee Academy or school. The instructor should discussion variations of the activity (e.g., different equipment on the playground). \u0088 The instructor should then show how the handout has been cut into individual squares. The squares should then be arranged in the order of t he instructor's preference and placed on a table for the cl ass to see. For ex ample, READING may be the first square, GAMES se cond, LUNCH third, PLAYGROUND/RECESS fourth, etc. (The instructor should role-model academic choices first.) \u0088 The instructor should explain why they like each activity, making sure to stress that all activities are enjoyable in school, even if some are more challenging than others. \u0088 The instructor should pass out the handout Sc hool Activities Grid (all three pages) to each student and review the pictures on the handout again. The students can draw their own activities in the blank squares. \u0088 The instructor should divide the students into groups of three or four so that the students are sitting together in a group of de sks or at a table. If possible, an adult should join the group to help facilitate the activity. \u0088 The instructor should demonstrate how the students are to fill in the blank squares with additional pictures, cut out each pictur e, and then line the pi ctures up in the order of preference. \u0088 It is important to recognize that the st udents may have difficulty with the scissors INSTRUCTIONS Primary Level Activities - #14 Favorite School Activities 3 \u0088 and may not understand how to show order of preference.

It may be difficult for them to understand how to prepare for cold weather when they can't even imagine what it looks or feels like. In this activity, the students will learn about appropriate clothing for cold weather. They should be encouraged to be prepared for weather changes that will start at the beginning of the school year. They can ta lk to their family members and Refugee Resettlement Case Manager about clothing that they will need. Large tote/paper bag containing winter: \u0083 winter jacket \u0083 umbrella Access to a window that allows students to see the weather Optional: Bucket of ice cubes Information about where to obtain winter clothi ng in the local area (thrift shops, local stores, churches, school nurse, etc.) OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with winter clothing and how to prepare for cold weather.

The instructor and students shoul d comment on the weather, describing how it looks and feels. Compare the current weather to the days before. \u0088 Since the Refugee Academy may be held in the summer, it might be difficult for refugee students to imagine what cold weathe r looks and feels like. The instructor should show the students pictures of autumn and winter scenes, commenting on how the weather looks and feels. \u0088 The instructor can pass around a bucket of ice cubes for students to touch so they can get a sense of how cold weather feels. \u0088 The instructor should stress the enjoyable ac tivities of winter, rather than how the cold weather can be unpleasant! Show the handouts Sledding and Snowman. 2 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather \u0088 Snow Day! (Explain why a school snow day may be necessary.) \u0088 Demonstrate each piece of winter clothing, explaining how it is important. For example, the wind can blow, but a sca rf will keep the children warm. Making snowballs is fun, but gloves or mittens are necessary. A hat is very important because it keeps the heat from esc aping through the head (although students need to know that it keeps ears and head warm). \u0088 The instructor should explain to students that they need to be protected from cold weather so that they ar e comfortable and warm. ( Optional: Although colds and flu technically don't come from dressing inapprop riately in cold weat her, the instructor may want to explain that sometimes people get the sniffles in the winter (referred to as a \"cold.\") Share the handout Tissues and show students how to properly use a tissue and throw it out.) \u0088 Put all of the winter clothing into the paper/tote bag and ask each child, one at a time, to come up and select one pi ece of clothing to try on. \u0088 Distribute the handouts that depict winter cl othing so that students can explain to their parents what the fam ily will need for cold weat her. Discuss with students how they can obtain winter clothing. 3 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 4 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 5 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 6 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 7 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 8 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 9 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 10 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 11 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 12 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 13 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 14 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 15 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 16 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 17 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 18 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 19 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 20 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather 21 Primary Level Activities - #15 Ready for Cold Weather #16 B ULLIES Also see Module #15 Staying Safe It is difficult to explain to re fugee students that they are safe in their new country, but at the sa me time tell them that they may be subjected to unsafe env ironments and bullies who set out to harm them. The vast majority of students in school w ill be friendly and helpful to new refugee students, but it is important to alert even the youngest students to the reality that some students will deliberately tease, threaten, frighten, or hurt them. These students are bullies and their behavior is usually unprovok ed and persistent, often continuing for a long period of time. Since bullies are seeking pow er and control, any student who appears to be vulnerable can be a target. Bullies tend to focus on student s who are \"different\" in color, dress, behavior, mannerisms, size, physical appear ance, and so forth. If a refugee student tends to be timid, withdrawn, and/or anxious, then bullies may zero in on that student. The more the target is visibly affected by th e bully, the more bullying tends to escalate. Bullying can be physical (poking, tripping, hi tting, blocking passage, etc.) as well as verbal and emotional (humili ating a student, ignoring a student and encouraging others to ignore, teasing, etc.). It can also o ccur online as \"cyberbullying\" (e-mails, photos, Facebook entries, etc.). Young students may not understand why someone continues to bother them. If they are new arrivals, they may not realize t hat bullying is considered unacceptable and may even be against the law. Of course, new students do need to learn how to get along with many different personalities. They are not going to be friends with everyone. Some of the American students will be unfriendly and inconsiderate - even insulting. Refugee students will need assistance in navigating the social dem ands of a new school. But if they are consistently attacked by another student, th en they need help and should know who to talk to about the problem. In some cases, the refugee students themselves may begin bullying because they are trying to achieve a sense of control over their own situation. They may have experienced bullying or violence in their home countries and have not learned how to Primary Level Activities - #16 Bullies 1 Drawing paper, cray ons/markers/paint Arrange for students to be able to visit a \"tru sted adult\" in their office (e.g., guidance counselor, principal, social worker, police offi cer) or invite them to class. The adults selected should be readily available to st udents once they attend school. (Note that some students may be uncomfortable around an officer in a uniform. Reassure the students and invite the officer to par ticipate in class activities.) Handouts: \u0083 Happy Face \u0083 Sad Face \u0083 Bully treat others with respect. It is important to begin with primary-level st udents by talking about how it feels to be treated with respect and kindnes s. If they feel angry, upset, or frightened when another student approaches them, t hen they should not tolerate it and need to talk to a trusted adult. Sharing this information with a adul t is difficult for children to do at any age, but younger children are more willing to ta lk about a bullying problem if they know exactly who they can turn to and how they will be protected. OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with how it feels to be bullied, and will learn who they can talk to if they experie nce or witness bullying. SUPPLIES 2 The instructor should post the handout Happy Face and ask the students what they see. Discuss: \u0083 how it feels to be happy (e.g., smiling, jumping, \"high five,\" cheering, etc.) \u0083 what can make people feel happy \u0083 what makes the students feel happy \u0083 how you can tell if someone is happy. INSTRUCTIONS Primary Level Activities - #16 Bullies 3 \u0088 The instructor should post the handout Sad Face and ask the students what they see. \u0088 Discuss how it feels to be sad (e.g., stom ach aches, loneliness, anger, not hungry, sleep problems) \u0088 Do not go any further with this discussi on, but immediately show the handout Bully and ask students what is happening in the picture. \u0088 Ask students to point to the posted picture that shows how the boy in the backpack must feel. The instructor can decide if the students nee d to learn the term \"bully\" or if they should just be aware that some students ma y treat them badly and they should not tolerate it. \u0088 Review the behaviors that can make students feel sad: \u0083 poking \u0083 tripping \u0083 hitting \u0083 blocking invading personal space \u0083 teasing \u0083 ignoring \u0083 urging other students to be mean \u0083 posting information on the computer \u0088 Explain that if any of those behaviors happ en often - especially if they occur when adults are not present to witness them - th en they must tell an adult. (If they ever feel frightened or sad about anything , they should talk to their teacher or other trusted adult.) \u0088 Introduce students to a trusted adult (see Supplies) and ask each student to name someone they can talk to if they ever feel that they are being bullied. \u0088 Distribute drawing paper and crayons, markers, or paint and ask students to make a colorful happy face like the one that is posted. They can decorate it with any other features. \u0088 Post the pictures and explai n that students should feel happy in school. If they are feeling sad, they should talk to t heir teacher or Refugee Resettlement Case Manager.

They should also know how to be safe when playing in the neighbor hood, or walking to a nearby store, recreational or religious center, or to school. Children in the primary gr ades should be accompanied by an adult when they are in their neighborhoods, but for a variety of reasons they may not always have adult supervision. If parents are confused about school schedules (such as half days and snow days) and the child discovers school is cancelled \u2014 or the parents are late to pick up the student \u2014 then it is important fo r primary-level student s to be aware of how to be safe and get the help that they need. It is important to focus on preventing problems when discussing safety in the neighborhood. There are resources in Module 15 : Staying Safe that cover topics such as bullying and gang recruitment. This activi ty focuses on being aware and alert, and how to get help if needed. Note: The recommendations made by the instru ctor will vary according to the location and safety of the neighborhood. OBJECTIVE Students will become familiar with safety st rategies outside the school setting. SUPPLIES Puppets (at least three) that will depict the people shown on the handouts NOTE: The handouts depict generic pictures t hat may not match exactly what the students will see in their neighborhood. They are intended to prompt discussion about where to go for help. If the instructor can find actual pictures of local people and sites, or take the students to the specific people and sites, th e students will know exactly where to go if they need help. 1 Primary Level Activities - #17 Safe in the Neighborhood 2 INSTRUCTIONS \u0088 The instructor should put on a puppet show that depicts a series of scenarios where a child needs help in their neighbor hood. For each scenario the child should know what to do to get help from adults . The following scenarios can be acted out: \u0083 A child is walking to school (or a recr eational or religious center) and is not sure about directions. (The scenar io can depict the child asking for help at a store, police stat ion, or fire station. Instructors should stress that it may not be a good idea to ask any adult stranger on the street for assistance. The student should know their home address and telephone number and the name of t he school or center.) \u0083 There is a conflict on a neighbor hood playground and parents are not present. (The scenario can depict t he student asking another parent for help, joining another group of children on the playground, or leaving the playground for a safer place. Module 15 : Staying Safe has specific information and handouts related to how to handle bullies.) \u0083 There is early dismissal from school because of weather, professional development programs, parent-teacher conferences, etc., without the knowledge of the parents. (The sc enario can depict the student expressing their concern to the teacher or principal. T he instructor can also refer to Parent Programs 1, 2, 3 for information and handouts for parents about school schedules and events.) \u0088 The instructor should show each handout pi cture and ask the students what they see in the picture. Handouts: \u0083 crossing guard \u0083 bus driver \u0083 police officer \u0083 teacher \u0083 Refugee Resettlement Case Manager \u0083 principal \u0083 fire station \u0083 police station \u0083 store \u0083 woman working at store Primary Level Activities - #17 Safe in the Neighborhood 3 \u0088 For each picture, the inst ructor should ask: If you were scared and you needed help, how could this person/place help you? \u0088 The instructor can teach the students the phrase: Can you help me? to practice. \u0088 The students can then produce their own puppet shows that depict how to stay safe and when to say Can you help me ? \u0088 As a follow-up activity, the instructor can invite local store owners, police officers and firefighters, religious leaders, and re creational center staff from the neighborhood to introduce themselves to the students and explain that they are available if help is needed.

As the students learn English and become more comfortable in the cl assroom, they will start to depend on their new skills (and their classmates) to commu nicate. But in the meantime, they can pull out a card to hand to the teacher. This process is not to replac e learning the English language, but is a transition tool that has proven to be helpful to st udents who are lost or confused. OBJECTIVE Students will experience using cards to communicate with teachers when they start school. SUPPLIES Handout: Flash Card Messages (4 pages) Create one set of 3x5 cards for each student with the Flash Card Messages on the cards. The cards can be clipped toget her, in a case, or wrapped up with a rubber band. The student's nam e should be on the cards. 1 Primary Level Activities - #18 Communicating with Teachers Also s ee Module 8 Getting Help INSTRUCTIONS \u0088 The instructor should provide each student with a set of 3x 5 cards that can be used for communicating with teachers. The ca rds are designed so the students can convey messages such as: \u0083 Can I use the restroom? \u0083 I need help with my bus. \u0083 Another child is bullying me. \u0083 Where is my classroom? \u0083 I need a book. \u0083 I need help with getting lunch. \u0083 I don't understand. \u0083 I don't feel well. \u0088 The instructor, with assistance from t he Academic Coach and interpreters, can explain each card. Students should practice gi ving the card to the instructor during the entire Refugee Academy so that they are comforta ble approaching a teacher with a card. This is also an opportunity to practice English. 2 Primary Level Activities - #18 Communicating with Teachers 3 Primary Level Activities - #18 Communicating with Teachers Restroom?

Activity #12: W HAT PARENTS NEED TO KNOW Grades K-12 (45-60 minutes) PURPOSE In this activity, refugee students will be informed about what their parents should ask about when meeting with school personnel. SUPPLIES \u0001 Handout: P arents - Ask About Note that this handout can be used as a discussion tool in parent meetings. DIRECTIONS \u0001 Distribute the handout Parents - Ask About to refugee students and explain that their parents or guardian should go over each item with a principal, guidance counselor, teacher of English Language Learners, or Academic Coach. (Instructors should be very specific about the adults in the school who can provide information.) Even if the students have been enrolled for a few weeks in school, the students might not be aware of information parents need to know. For example, parents may not know about permission slips, clothes for physical education, and annual health physicals. \u0001 The instructor should briefly review each item on the handout, spending more time on information that the students may not have experienced. For example, the students may know about the school schedule and lockers, but may not have experienced after-school activities or a field trip. \u0001 Review the following with all refugee students, regardless of how long the students have been enrolled in the school: o Attendance requirements o Absence calls and notes from parents o Student responsibility for taking notes home from school o Safety drills o Banned items (zero tolerance policy) Since too much information at once can be overwhelming, the instructor may want to cover a few items on the handout each day of the mini-academy. \u0001 The instructor should stress that parents need to know the details about school so they can help their children do well in school. The students should take the handout home, share what they know about each item and then encou rage their parents to contact the school to review each item on the handout.

Note that the Instructor should be familiar with school district policies on attendance. The New York State Department of Labor states: Minors must attend school full-time until the last day of the session in the school year in which the minor turns sixteen. School years run July 1 to June 30. A community can require minors who do not work to attend school full-time until the last day of session in the school year in which the minor turns 17. School district policies can be more explicit, such as the one below: School attendance is mandatory for minors from age six (age five in the xxx school district) to age 16. The law requires that school districts' educational boards create clear rules about acceptable and unacceptable absences and tardiness. The schools must notify parents when a child is late or absent without a legitimate excuse. Schools must keep accurate student lists and attendance counts. Schools may only expel students over 16 for failure to attend school for over 20 consecutive days. SUPPLIES \u0001 Sample absence notes if required by the district (e.g., from parents, doctor) \u0001 Han douts: o Good Reasons to Miss School? (This handout should be cut up into cards that are placed in a box or other container.) o Why Go To School Every Day? DIRECTIONS \u0001 The instructor should begin by explaining the attendance policy of the school district. The discussion should include: o A definition of \"attendance\" o School attendance as it pertains to the age of the student o School calendar and expected attendance (e.g. , number of days, holidays) o School hours See also: Module 3 Transportation and Time , Module 4 School Rules , Module 5 So Much to Learn! , Module 8 Getting Help , Module 13 Keeping Families Informed , Module 14 Coping with Stress and Module 15 Staying Safe Mini-Academy Curriculum 70o Grade level requirements (e.g., early dismissal for seniors in hi gh school) o Attendance as it relates to graduation. Empha sis should always be on the expectation that students will attend school every day of the week except weekends and holidays. \u0001 The instructor should show the students the container that has cards from the handout Good Reasons to Miss School ? Ask each student, one at a time, to pull a card from the container. The instructor should read the card aloud (unless the student is comfortable reading it) and ask t he entire class if they think it is a good reason to miss school. Explain what the students should do if the situation on the card occurs. Emphasize that stude nts should have a backup plan if they encounter problems getting to school. Discuss legitimate reasons for missing school, always emphasizing that students should make every effort to be in school every day, on time. (Note that many schools offer Perfect Attendance Awards, but students should not attend school if they are not well enough to be able to learn, and might be contagious.) Review the school district policy for reporting absences. Some districts require phoning the main office of the school or notifying the school by e-mail. Include discussion of: o Why the school district needs to know a student will be absent o What the school district will do if a student is absent and has not been informed o What is required when the student returns to school. \u0001 The instructor should give students the chance to reveal why they may not want to go to school. They may be having difficulty with communication and making new friends. They may be experiencing bullying, or are confused about how to fit in to their new environment. Some refugee students may have health, hygiene, or literacy problems that are interfering with their ability to enjoy the school day and learn. The instructor should raise these concerns even if the students don't mention them. Emphasis should always be on the importance of utilizing the school as a resource for learning and support. The instructor should identify very specific resources such as school guidance counselors, Refugee Resettlement Case Managers, administrators, and other adults who can assist students. (See Mini-Activity #14 Who Can I Talk To? for a helpful handout.) \u0001 Distribute the handout Why Go To School Every Day? and discuss the opportunities in their school that can make school more appealing, and encourage excellent attendance.

Grades 6-12 (30-45 minutes) PURPOSE In this activity, refugee students will learn about adults in the school who can provide support and guidance. Note: Many of the students in the Mini-Academy may have enrolled in the middle of the school year. It is difficult enough to adjust when the school year is just beginning, but mid-year can be especially overwhelming. This activity should be conducted with mid-year students, but also reviewed with students who enrolled at the beginning of the school year. SUPPLIES \u0001 Hando uts: o Who Can I Talk To? Note: The Instructor should complete this form in advance adding the names of adults in the school who are available to refugee students to provide guidance and support. If possible, those individuals should be personally introduced to the students. o Sad o Happy and Sad Students o Worried o Worried Student o Scared o Scared Student o Sick o Sick Student (with School Nurse) \u0001 Optio nal: o Visits from: Worker; school psycho logist; school law enforcement; Physical Education or Health teacher, English Language Learner teachers, principal o School tours to offices of counselors and administrators o Recording of the song Home (C o-written by Drew Pearson and Greg Holden) o Handout: Home L yrics See also: Module 8 Getting Help and Module 14 Coping with Stress Mini-Academy Curriculum 75DIRECTIONS \u0001 Regardless of their length of attendance in an American school, all refugee students should be constantly reassured that there are a number of adults in the school who can help them. The students can approach any of these adults with specific questions. They can seek out an adult to talk to them, but only if they know where their offices are located. \u0001 The instructor should distribute the handout Who Can I Talk To? and discuss the names on the form. Explain: o What the person is responsible for in the school o How the person can help refugee students o Where the offices are located o What steps to take to arrange for a visit o Confidentiality and involvement of parents \u0001 Show the following handouts. Demonstrate and discuss each emotion. o Sad o Sad and Happy Students o Worried o Worried Student o Scared o Scared Student o Sick o Sick Student with School Nurse Explain who the students can talk to if they are feeling the emotion, using the Who Can I Talk To? handout as a guide. \u0001 As an optional follow-up activity, the Instructor can distribute the handout Home Lyrics and play a recording of the song. (The Instructor may want to point out that the song was originally sung by Phillip Phillips, winner of the 2012 American Idol competition. It is a good chance to talk about popular television shows that the students may hear about, such as American Idol .) The Instructor can discuss the meaning of key phrases in the song, with emphasis on: Just know you're not alone You get lost you can always be found I'm going to make this place your home. Point out the names on the Who Can I Talk To? handout. Explain that they are going to \"make this place your home.\" The students may want to learn the words of the song and sing along - or just join in the chorus.

Grades K-3 and 4-12 or large group of all ages working together (including parents) PURPOSE In t his activity, refugee students show their personal characteristics and interests and work together to create a quilt. SUPPLIES \u0001 Han douts: o Quilt o Student Quilt o Blank Quilt Square o Quilt Coloring Page \u0001 Chart or butcher paper, cut and taped to form a background for the quilt blocks \u0001 Crayons, markers, or colored pencils \u0001 Samples of cloth quilts or pictures of quilts Note: Identify a space where the final student quilt can be displayed. \u0001 Optional: o Invite a local quilter to show and discuss finished quilts. Emphasis should be on how the blocks come together to create the quilt. o Students can draw pictures on cotton cloth quilt blocks with fabric markers. Blocks can be sewn together with yarn or on a sewing machine. DIRECTIONS \u0001 The instructor should show the handouts Qui lt and Student Quilt , as well as other pictures of quilts so that students can see that pieces form \"blocks\" and blocks are put together to create a quilt. \u0001 Distribute the handout Blank Quilt Square and the markers, crayons, or colored pencils. Explain that each student will create a block for a class quilt. Their block should be filled with a picture of themselves, surrounded by drawings of their interests and activities. See also: Module 7 Interests and Talents and Module 14 Coping with Stress Mini-Academy Curriculum 87 For example, the student could draw a self-portrait in the center of the block. The self- portrait could be surrounded by pictures of favorite sports, foods, hobbies, clothing and jewelry, friends, etc. Encourage students to add their names to their blocks. If parents are participating in the activity, they can help the students determine what should be drawn on the block. Emphasize that the students should have the final decision on what they want to tell about themselves on the blocks. \u0001 Involve the class in laying out the blocks to create the quilt. There should be the same number of blocks in each row, so the instructor or Academic Coach may have to create a block. \u0001 The blocks can be glued to the chart paper and displayed in the classroom or hall with the sign TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF! \u0001 If the students are comfortable speaking in front of the class, the instructor should ask each student to point out their block and describe what they included on the block. \u0001 Optional: Distribute the handout Quilt Coloring Page for students to color. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS Afte r completing the activity, ask the students the following questions: \u0001 What are the many different interests in this room? What does that tell us about the people in our school? \u0001 Who has the same picture drawn on their quilt block? \u0001 Who can teach you something that you would like to know about?

For each handout, explain why the item or activity is healthy or unhealthy. Act out the reasons and provide specific examples, such as smoking can make you cough and have difficulty breathing - or protein can build muscles. o Hamburger, Fries, Soda o Pizza o Cake o Hot Dog o Ice Cream, Candy o Carrot o Grapes o Fruit - Strawberry, Pear, Cherry, Plum o Peas o Salad o Tomato o Sweet Potato o 12 Fruits o Hygiene (Shower, Soap, Shaving, Teeth, Hair) o Washing Hair o Food Handling Mini-Academy Curriculum 95\u0001 The instructor has the option of continuing with remaining handouts that focus on more sensitive topics. \u0001 Discussion about whether drugs and alcohol are healthy or unhealthy should be discussed in depth, preferably with assistance from a drug and alcohol abuse counselor. The instructor can determine if there is enough time to review the topic so that students can comprehend the messages. \u0001 Show the handouts Alcohol and Drugs (Marijuana) and discuss: o Unhealthy aspects of drugs and alcohol o Availability of drugs and alcohol o How to say no to drugs and alcohol The Instructor should point out that hygiene is important, and sometimes bath salts are used when taking a bath. However, ingesting the bath salts can be extremely dangerous. \u0001 Show the handouts Bath and Bath Salts and explain that bath salts should never be chewed, inhaled, or swallowed. (Bath salts can cause agitation, paranoia, hallucinations, chest pain, and suicidality, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. They have recently become a popular drug used by young people, primarily because they are easily obtainable over-the-counter.) \u0001 Show the handouts Medications and Pharmacist and discuss how medicines are important if you are sick, but they should only be taken: o If they are recommended by a doctor (or pharmacist) o If they match a specific illness o If the directions are followed, especially the dosage for children o If there are no known allergies o If an adult is administering and monitoring the results. The students should never take any medication that is given to them by another student. (Note: Children are raiding family medicine cabinets and sharing prescription medications. Explain that no one should take a medication unless it has been prescribed specifically for them by a doctor. The medications are purchased at a pharmacy/drug store.) \u0001 Show the handout School Nurse and explain that all medications should be kept in the office of the school nurse during the school day. Students are not allowed to have any medications on their person, in lockers, or in backpacks - including over-the-counter medications taken for ailments such as headache, cough, etc. Mini-Academy Curriculum 96Medicine is stored in the school nurse's office and is administered according to the physician's prescription only by the nurse. \u0001 Distribute the handout Good For You? Ask the students to circle the pictures of the healthy items only. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS Afte r completing the activity, ask the students the following questions: \u0001 Can you still eat foods that are unhealthy, such as French fries and potato chips? \u0001 Why are some foods delicious but not always good for your health? \u0001 Can you always see how an unhealthy food (or habit) is making you unhealthy? \u0001 Why are cigarettes unhealthy? \u0001 Why should you be careful about taking medicines that you can find in a local drug store? \u0001 Should you take medications found in someone's house or given to you by another student? \u0001 What should you do if someone gives you drugs or alcohol?

SUPPLIES \u0001 Ice c ubes or crushed ice \u0001 Freezer packs (to show slippery ice) \u0001 Handouts: o Rain o Snow o Mud o Windy o Sleet o Ice In trees o Leaves o Heat/Hot Sun \u0001 Note: Actual articles of clothing can be used instead of the handouts. o Sweater o Raincoat o Jacket o Sweatshirt (hoodie) o Cap o Winter Hat o Winter Gloves o Boots (winter and rain) o Scarf o Umbrella o Sun hat \u0001 Handouts to color: Umbrella, Snowman, Baseball Cap See also: Module 6 Stay Healthy and Activities for Grades K-2 Activity #15 Ready for Cold Weather Mini-Academy Curriculum 124\u0001 Optional: o Snowballs o Instructor's clothing, to demonstrate what is worn in different types of weather. DIRECTIONS \u0001 Ask the students to look out the window and describe the weather. Ask them what the weather was like when they got up in the morning, and if they know what weather is expected in the evening. (If possible, check a weather report together.) \u0001 Show the handouts that depict different kinds of weather: Rain, S now, Mud, Windy, Sleet, Ice In Trees , Leaves, Heat/Hot Sun . \u0001 Ask the students to feel the ice cubes (or freezer packs) and describe how they feel. Explain that during winter there can be ice, snow, sleet, and freezing rain, and the air and surfaces are cold. \u0001 Show the handouts: Sleet, Ice In Trees, Snow. \u0001 Show the clothing handouts (or actual clothing). \u0001 Ask the students how they think they should dress during winter. Keep in mind that many refug ee students have never had to wear a coat, gloves, or boots, so they will not know how to answer the question about appropriate clothing for different weather. They can choose from actual articles of clothing or guess from looking at the pictures on the handouts. \u0001 Ask the students to match the weather handouts to the clothing handouts, or use actual artic les of clothing. \u0001 Discuss how it starts to get dark earlier in the winter and the temperature drops when the sun goes down. \u0001 Optional: The instructor should put on each piece of personal clothing and ask the stude nts when they should wear that clothing (e.g., winter jacket, rain boots, sun hat). \u0001 Distribute the handouts for students to color. Suggest that they add clothing to the picture, such as a raincoat and boots with the umbrella. \u0001 Optional: Discuss the names of the seasons that match the weather. Mini-Academy Curriculum 125 FOLLOW-UP DISCUSSION After completing the activity, ask the students the following questions: \u0001 Where can you get the clothing that you need for each type of weather? \u0001 Why is it important to stay warm and dry in cold or rainy weather? \u0001 Why is it important to drink fluids when it is hot? \u0001 What weather did you experience before you came to America?

SUPPLIES \u0001 Hando ut: Puzzle Pieces \u0001 Handout: Things I Like About School \u0001 Colored pencils, crayons, or markers \u0001 Envelopes for storing puzzles \u0001 Sample classroom boxes of puzzles (5-1000 pieces) \u0001 Optional: o Magazines, scissors, glue sticks o Stickers related to school activities o Practice puzzles o Pictures of clip art school-related items printed from websites such as googleimages.com o Lamination of completed puzzles before they are cut into pieces DIRECTIONS \u0001 During the Refugee Academy, the students have begun to identify what appeals to them about their new school. Several of the activities in the modules in the Welcome To Our Schools curriculum expose students to classroom and extracurricular activities, as well as supplies and equipment that are used in American schools. Demonstrate how puzzle pieces are put together, using 5-piece puzzles as well as 50, 100, and even 500-1000 piece puzzles. \u0001 The instructor should explain to the refugee students that they are going to be making their own puzzles that show what they personally enjoy about school. \u0001 Show the students the handout Puzzle Pieces and explain that they are going to cover the pieces with pictures of things that they enjoy about school. They can use one or more of the following: o Crayons, colored pencils, or markers o Pictures cut from magazines o Stickers See also: Module 5 Much To Learn and Module 7 Interests and Talents Mini-Academy Curriculum 149 \u0001 Their pictures can consist of: o A separate picture on each puzzle piece o Drawings that cover more than one piece o A complete picture that fills the entire puzzle. Demonstrate each technique using the Puzzle Pieces handout. Students can start to envision their puzzle if examples are shown to them. \u0001 Encourage the students to fill in each piece with color. For example, a piece can be colored completely in blue crayon and a sticker or magazine picture can be glued on top of the blue. \u0001 Distribute the handout Things I Like About School to provide the students with ideas about what can be included on their puzzles. If they spot something that they enjoy about school, they can cut a picture from the handout, draw a similar picture, or find one in a magazine. \u0001 The instructor should explain to the students that when they are finished decorating the pieces, they are going to cut the puzzle on the lines provided on the handout. (Note that instructors may want to laminate the puzzles before they are cut.) \u0001 Place puzzle pieces in an envelope marked with the student's name. \u0001 Pair students so that they can exchange puzzle envelopes, put the puzzles together, and discuss the images on the puzzles. \u0001 Encourage students to take their envelopes home and demonstrate the puzzle to their parents, discussing what they enjoy about school. \u0001 Note that instructors can set up a separate puzzle table so that students have the opportunity to work on a large, complex puzzle. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS After completing the activity, ask the students the following questions: \u0001 What pictures did you put on your puzzle? \u0001 Why did you choose them? \u0001 Who else had those pictures? Mini-Academy Curriculum 150\u0001 What pictures did you want to show but you didn't have room - or you had difficulty drawing or finding them? \u0001 What is your favorite puzzle piece? The instructor should be aware that as students are decorating their puzzles and discussing the images that they have selected, they may mention what they dislike about school. Take advantage of these \"teachable moments\" to talk about how to cope with the more challenging aspects of their new school. JOURNAL ACTIVITY During the Refugee Academy, the students were encouraged to write or draw in a journal. Some s tudents may have continued the process during school. Distribute journals (or notebooks/notebook paper), pencils, and crayons or colored pencils. Ask the students to respond to the following questions in their journals: \u0001 What did I include on my puzzle and why? \u0001 What other things about school can I add to the puzzle?

Many have ex perienced violence, have moved frequently, or have settled in refugee camps, living without essential resources, health care, or education. They arrive in America displa ced from their homelands, expected to acclimate to a culture that is often radically different from what they have known. The experience of displacement is one of the most significant traumas and losses that refugees of all ages can face. The la ck of stability and safety, the constant disruptions, and the sometimes prolonged depr ivation exact their toll on each family member. For children, it put s them at profound development al risk, often impairing cognitive abilities as well as emotional , academic, or behavioral functioning. Yet when refugee children arrive in the United States, if they ar e between the ages of 5 and 18, they are enrolled in an American sc hool and expected to quickly adjust to their new way of living. Suddenly they ar e riding school buses; navigating school hallways, cafeterias, and locker rooms; si tting in classrooms; and trying to manage a new language, schoolwork, friendships, and after-school activities. The experience can be frightening, sometimes exhilarating , and overwhelming for even the most resilient children. Welcome to Our Schools , developed by the Office of Refugee and Immigrant Services of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA), is designed to ease the transition of refugee ch ildren into the elementary and secondary schools of New York State, and to empower their parents to be effective partners in the education of their children. Mini-Academy Curriculum 1 How to Use the Mini-Academy Curriculum Mini-Academy instructors should match the activities from the Refugee Academy Curriculum and the Mini-Academy Curriculum to the needs of the students who are attending the Mini-Academy. It may be nece ssary to review the contents of the Refugee Academy Curriculum entirely with the students, or to blend some of the activities from the Refugee Academy Modules with activities from the Mini-Academy Curriculum . Although instructors may have experience working with refugee children, it is essential that during the Mini-Academy they view the world of school through the eyes of newcomers. A new school is difficult enoug h for American students who know the system. Refugee students have to juggle multiple concerns as they try to adjust to schools that are fast-moving, well-establishe d in their routines, and challenging to anyone who is new to the system. Refugee children are vulnerable , both academically and socially. Once resettled in the United States, their ability to successfully navigate the school experience is dependent on a number of factors such as age, cultur e, coping strategies, parental support, degree of interrupted schooling, and reception by the host community. The children may be living with new \"families\" who are relati ves they never met before. They may be living with host families or guardians w ho are responsible for their care. Some children have been exposed to extended violence in war zones and refugee camps while others have witnessed war-rela ted events or death of family and community members. Studies of refugee children in a school environment find that exposure to war and persecution can resu lt in significant delays in academic achievement. Depression, aggressive behavior, immaturity and physical ailments such as headaches and stomachaches are found to be common in the refugee school-aged population. All of these difficu lties interfere significantly with the learning process. The students need attentive school staf f, extra individual attenti on, and intensive support to tackle not only the academic concerns, but t he social, emotional, material and health concerns as well. Parental/guardian involvement in school is strongly associated with positive outcomes in academic performance and school behavior. In the case of refugee children, adjust- ment can be eased through parental involvemen t. Such involvement includes: creating a time and place at home to do ho mework; monitoring homework; encouraging and facilitating school attendance; alerting the school to problems or is- sues as they arise that may affect their child's performance or behavior; managing health care of the student; staying informed of stu- dent progress and grades; monitoring quality of school services; and communicating with teachers, including parti cipation in parent/teacher conferences and the school Open House. But many factors inhibit parental involvement in their child's education life. First, language serves as a major barrier. Re fugee parents are unable to comprehend the telephone call that reports the child is abs ent from school (or is sick and needs to go home). They cannot understand notes sent home from the teacher. The homework is incomprehensible. They may be unaware of sc hool events. Many do not participate in important parent/teacher conferences because of their inability to understand English, or because of their discomfort around teachers and other authority figures. Furthermore, parents are often unaware of community resource s or unable to access them, and need an advocate who can help them find ways to meet their own needs. In addition, refugee parents lack understanding about the workings of American school systems and may find the institution and the educational process intimidating. They are unfamiliar with New York State education law, rights and responsibilities, and obligations. They are not aware of the range of opportunities in schools, including academic, extracurricu lar, and vocational programs. Mandatory school attendance may be a brand-new concept, and they may have little understanding of the school's ex pectations of them as partners in the education of their children. Mini-Academy Curriculum 2 At the same time, American schools are not usually linguistically or culturally equipped to meet the specia l needs of refugee children. The schools struggle with language barriers and lack of information abo ut the cultural background and history of the students. While mo st schools welcome refugee ch ildren, they are often anxious about communicating with the refu gee children and their families. Teachers find that strategies, policies and expectati ons that accommodate the needs of their current students do not always work well fo r refugee children. School districts do not usually have the resources and are not set up to provide intensive orientation or to tailor curriculum and educational servic es to the specific and varying needs (academic, language, behavioral, cognitive) of the refugee student population. Schools find age-appropriate grade level pl acement challenging for students who lack a background of formal schooling or who have experienced significant interruptions in their education. Refugee chil dren are often left on their own to master a new language, decipher expectations, and figure out how the American school system functions. Recognizing the backgrounds of the re fugee students, the Bu reau of Refugee and Immigrant Affairs has created Welcome to Our Schools that consistently emphasizes three themes: Expose students to all aspects of the American Educational program so that they are familiar with how education works in their new country. Encourage students to take advantage of the multiple benefits of an American education. Reassure students that they will successfully adjust to their new schools. Mini-Academy Curriculum 3 Objectives The Mini-Academy could consist of student s who have recently enrolled in school, have experienced several weeks of school, or are a mixture of new and experienced students. New students, whether they are in an entire Mini-Academy of newcomers or are mixed in with experienced students, must be taught the Key Points in the Modules in the Refugee Academy Curriculum . The objectives for all of the ac tivities are that students will: \u008f Review the Key Points of the Refugee Academy Curriculum \u008f Get reacquainted and develop new friendships \u008f Comfortably share observations and concerns \u008f Assist new students in adjusting \u008f Learn new information about school \u008f Participate in activities that are fun and rewarding New Students in the Mini-Academy The participants in a Mini-Academy may be new students who enrolled when school was already underway, and did not have the oppor tunity to participate in the Refugee Academy. They may have enrolled mid-y ear, when school was already underway. For those students, the Welcome to Our Schools Refugee Academy Curriculum should be used as a guide for Mini-Academ y activities. The modules in the Refugee Academy Curriculum cover the following topics, all designed to assist refugee students in adjusting to American schools: Module 1 : ................................................................ American Schools Module 2 : ................................................................ Making Friends Module 3 : ................................................................ Transportation and Time Module 4 : ................................................................ School Rules Module 5 : ................................................................ So Much to Learn! Module 6 : ................................................................ Stay Healthy Module 7 : ................................................................ Interests and Talents Module 8 : ................................................................ Getting Help Module 9 : ................................................................ Study Skills Module 10 : .............................................................. Taking Tests Module 11 : .............................................................. Technology and Schools Module 12 : .............................................................. School Safety Module 13 : .............................................................. Keeping Families Informed Module 14 : .............................................................. Coping with Stress Module 15: .............................................................. Stayi ng Safe Module 16 ............................................................... Hate Crime Mini-Academy Curriculum 4 Mini-Academy instructors can select Modules that seem most relevant to the Mini- Academy students, or can revi ew highlights of each of the Modules. The handouts included in the Refugee Academy Curriculum and the videos in the Welcome To Our Schools program can be used for introducing topics to refugee students who are new to the school system. Experienced Students in the Mini-Academy The participants in the Mini -Academy may be students who par ticipated in the Refugee Academy and have already been attending school. The instructors may determine that the experienced students need to review some of the Key Points in the Refugee Academy Curriculum , such as study skills, taking tests, or coping with stress. They may need to repeat activities from the Re fugee Academy modules for the purpose of sharing experiences, reinforcing key points, reflecting on growth, or addressing new issues. This Mini-Academy Curriculum includes additional activiti es that can be conducted with experienced students. Emphas is in the additional activities is on building relationships with other refugee students. Mini-Academy Curriculum 5 Key Points \u2014 Mini-Academy 1. Refugee students can help each other. During the Refugee Academy, the students were new to the school system and were learning the basics about how to navigate a typical school day. As they became more acclimated to the school, they learned the rules, procedures, and typical activities of their school. They learned about strategies fo r getting through times that are difficult, and they experienced the benef its and rewards of attending a new school. By the time they participate in a Mini-Academy, t hey are in a position to share what they have learned. In the Mini-Academy, the experienced st udents may be joined by students who are brand new to the school. It is important for students to understand that no matter how much experience they have in American sc hools, they can all help each other. For many experienced students, especially children in t he elementary grades, it is hard to remember those first few days of school when everything was new and overwhelming. During the Mini-Academy it is not necessary for students to review the challenges of those first weeks, but it is important to share ti ps about how they get through the day. They can discuss what stra tegies they have developed that may reduce confusion or ease the stress. They can also reassure their peers who are new to the school that as the school year progresses, they will adjust and feel less like newcomers. Sometimes new student s just need to hear from t heir peers that they will succeed in adjusting to school. Instructors in the Mini-Academy shoul d encourage students to share their experiences, good or bad, emphasizing wh at they have learned from the experiences. They should point out the resili ence of the students, and their ability to solve problems and seek out help when it is needed. An essential message is t hat the students shoul d be able to rely on each other because they are all going through similar periods of adjustment. They have all had past experiences that are difficult to ov ercome. With assistance and reassurance from other refugee st udents, even if they do not speak the same language and have not shared a similar history, refugee students can feel comfor table that at least their refugee peers are looking out for them. 2. Adults in the school ar e available to help them. During the Refugee Academy and the first few days of school, refugee students were undoubtedly introduced to a number of adults who can provide assistance. However, like anyone entering a new environment, Mini-Academy Curriculum 6 this information is often difficult to abs orb before school is underway. The refugee students may have become familiar with their Academic Coach, classroom teachers, and perhaps other school district personnel (e.g., classroom paraprofessionals, cafeteria personnel, etc.), but they may not be aware of all of the adults who stand ready to assist them. Refugee students may not realiz e that there are guidance counselors, school nurses, physical education teachers and coac hes, and school social workers and psychologists who can help them with questions and problems. They may not know who is available to help them, how to appr oach adults, and what the procedures are for requesting assistance. This information is especially important for students who have just enrolled in the school. Instructors should use the Mini-Academ y to connect the refugee students with school-based adults, even if they have met them before. They should invite the adults to the Mini-Academy, introduce them, tell the students how to reach the adults, and ensure that the Academic Coaches know how to connect adult school personnel with students. A classroom project or social activity is an excellent means of showing the students that the adults are kind, approachable, and willing to help. Instructors should include perso nnel the students may see daily, such as hall monitors, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, and school -based law enforcement. Again, the students may have met them during the Refugee Aca demy, but the Mini-Academy provides a chance for them to talk to familiar adul ts and become acquainted with adults who are there to provide assistance. 3. Friendships are th e foundation for ensuring successful adjust ment to new schools. Although educators put a lot of emphasis on refugee students learning the rules and procedures of school and adjusting to the demands of an academic curriculum, it is the development of friendships that is critic al for new student adjustment. Many refugee students have had to leave behi nd not only their personal belongings, but important relationships. They miss their fr iends. It is difficult for them to connect with new peers and then build friendships that are comforting and rewarding. The attitude of students at school can be dete rmined by the status of their friendships, especially for students in middle or high schools. For ref ugee students, the development of new friendships is ev en more challenging because of language barriers. During a Mini-Academy it is importa nt to cultivate relationships, even if students do not speak the same language (or English), and to review the many ways that students can make friends. The Key Points from Refugee Academy Curriculum Module 2: Making Friends should be reinforced during the Mini-Academy. Mini-Academy Curriculum 7 4. Students are trying to balance personal life and school life, ofte n resulting in stress. During the Refugee Academy, refugee student s had the opportunity to learn about the way a school system works in America, how they can maintain their health and hygiene, how they can participate in extracu rricular activities, what they can do to study and stay organized, and a vast array of other topics. Although the review of these topics was undoubtedly helpful as the students had to adjust to new school experiences, the information was more than likely overwhelming. Once students actually enter ed the school and participated in classes and school events, they may have become highly stressed as they tried to fit in to their new environment and apply the skills that they learned in the Refugee Academy. New students who have entered school afte r it is underway may be particularly stressed. In addition, many refugee student s are coping with challenges in their personal lives, such as housing conditions , parental stress, health problems, and financial pressures on their families. A Mini-Academy can provide an opportunity for students to release stress. The environment of the Mini-Academy should be re laxed and fun. The activities should be designed to include all of the students, giving them opportunities to share their experiences, discuss their conc erns, and support their peers. Students should have the chance to intera ct informally, develop camaraderie, and share openly with each other, as the instructors guide and support. Refugee students should leave a Mini-Academy feeling reassured and motivated to tackle another school day. Mini-Academy Curriculum 8 Activity #1: STORIES ABOUT SCHOOL Grades K-12 (60 - 90 minutes) PURPOSE In this activity, students work together to highlight the ups and downs of a typical school day, and to share suggestions about adjusting to a new school. SUPPLIES \u0088 5 sets of 40 laminated Story Cards (or c opies of each picture - see Mini-Academy handouts) \u0088 2-4 desks pushed together to create a table \u0088 Journals, notebooks, or notebook paper \u0088 Pencils, colored pencils, crayons, for writing/drawing in journals DIRECTIONS \u0088 Introduce the activity by explaining to t he students that they are going to have the opportunity to work with other students to create a story. \u0088 Divide the large group into five small groups. There should not be more than 5 in a group, if possible. \u0088 Distribute a set of laminated cards to each group and ask the students to lay out the cards on the table, in any order. \u0088 Tell the students that, using t he laminated pictures, they ar e to create a story that describes a day at school for a refugee stude nt. They can decide on their own main character, selecting the age, gender, native country, and daily routine. \u0088 The students are to rearrange the card s so that they are in the order of their story. They should keep rearranging the cards until their story starts to emerge. Each group should end up with a different order of pictures. For example, one group may start with cards that depict a bathtub and breakfast, while another group ma y start with a picture of a stack of books and a student playing soccer. Mini-Academy Curriculum 9 Students in grades K-3 should decide on at least 5 cards to include in their story. Students in grades 4-6 should use at least 10 cards in their story. Students in grades 7- 12 should use at least 20 cards in their story. After all of the stories are created, the small groups will share their stories with the large group. \u0088 Explain to the students that t hey are telling a story, not just giving a step-by-step description of the school day. Step-by-step: Then Mahar went to his locker. Story: Mahar went to his locker and realiz ed that he had forgotten his math book. The stories should include events that students in the group have experienced or witnessed. The story should incl ude positive experiences and daily challenges. The students should be enc ouraged to move the cards around until they agree upon the ev ents of the stories. \u0088 All students in the group shoul d have the opportunity to contribute to the story, even if they do not speak English. Explain to students that when they tell their story to the large group, every member of thei r small group should have a chance to tell part of the story. Some students will need translators and some will be unwilling to speak in front of the large group, but every st udent should be given the opportunity to describe what is happening in at least one of the pictures. \u0088 The instructor should circulate, assisting the groups in deciding how to build their stories around the pictures. The groups shou ld reach consensus on the story line, so instructors should watch for indivi duals who may be dominating the group. Instructors should remind t he students that they are to include scenes in their stories that show what a day is like for a day at school for a refugee student. \u0088 New students may have difficulty partici pating in the activity. Encourage the students in the small groups to teach t he new students about the pictures on the cards. The emphasis of the activity should be on group work and working together, not on which group c an create the best story. Mini-Academy Curriculum 10 \u0088 The instructor should give the students a 10-minute warning to finish up their stories and put the laminated cards in thei r final order. Each group will have to decide how they are going to present the story. They do not have to write down their story unless they are more comfortable pres enting with notes. \u0088 Groups can decide on a spokesperson to faci litate their presentation, or they can just take turns when they present their st ories. The type of presentation will be determined by the comfort leve l of the students, not only in speaking in front of the large group, but in speaking English. The instructor should determine the order of the presentations. Regardless of the order, the final story should be the one that is the most entertaining. \u0088 As each group tells their story, they should hold up the pictures that they selected. FOLLOW -UP DISCUSSION After all of the stories are told, the instructor should discuss the following: If there is time, give the students a chance to use the same cards to create a different story. Keep the same groups if they are working well together, or mix up the groups to facilitate new perspectives and relationships. \u00d7 Did you see any themes in the stories? Were activities repeated? \u00d7 What were the feelings of t he characters in the stories? \u00d7 How would you be able to help the main characters? \u00d7 Have you ever experienced anything in the stories? JOURNAL ACTIVITY During the Refugee Academy, th e students were encouraged to write or draw in a journal. Some students may have continued the process during school. Distribute journals (or notebooks/notebook paper), pencils , and crayons or colored pencils. Ask the students to respond to the following question in their journals: \u00d7 What will my next day at school be like, and how can I prepare for it?

Mini-Academy Curriculum 11 STORY CARDS Mini-Academy Curriculum 12 Mini-Academy Curriculum 13 Mini-Academy Curriculum 14 Mini-Academy Curriculum 15 Mini-Academy Curriculum 16 Mini-Academy Curriculum 17 Mini-Academy Curriculum 18 Activity #2: WE ARE ALL CONNECTED Grades 4-12 (30 - 45 minutes) PURPOSE In this activity, students are encouraged to rely on each other for support. SUPPLIES \u0088 Ball of yarn at least 4\" in diam eter (or several smaller balls of yarn). Do not use a ball of string or twine. \u0088 Journals, notebooks, or notebook paper \u0088 Pencils, colored pencils, crayons, for writing/drawing in journals \u0088 Optional guests who are responsible for providing guidance and support to refugee students, including ot her refugee students \u0088 Room for a large circle of the entire group of students, instructors, and guests DIRECTIONS \u0088 Arrange the group in a large circle in a classroom, playground, or gymnasium. Include instructor/guests in the circle, a llowing one instructor to be outside of the circle, facilitating the activity. The circ le should be small enough to allow for tossing a ball of yarn back and forth. If necessary, form two circles, but one large circle is preferable. \u0088 The instructor in the circle should begin t he activity by loosely tying the end of the ball of yarn around his/her wrist and then answering the following question posed by the facilitator: Who would you turn to if you had a problem? In answering the question, the instructor should provide specific explanations, elaborating on the response. For example: If I had a problem with a friendship, I would talk to another friend to get ideas about what to do - or I would go directly to my friend to talk things out. If I was having a problem with my job, I would talk to __________ because s/he always has good ideas. Mini-Academy Curriculum 23 \u0088 The instructor then tosses the ball of yarn to a st udent on the other side of the circle. \u0088 The receiving student loosely wraps the yarn around his/her wrist. The question is repeated, t he receiving student answers it, and then the ball is tossed to another student or adult across the circle. \u0088 Continue wrapping the yarn, answering the question, and tossing the ball until a \"spider web\" formation begins to occur in the circle. (If more than one ball of yarn is used, then tie the yarn ends together and continue the activity.) As the question is being answered, the facilitator can provide additional information about who to seek out for assistance with a problem. Some students may be new to the school and have no idea w ho they can turn to if they have a problem. In that case, the fa cilitator should stress that the members of the circle are an excellent resource. Stop and take t he time to introduce the new student to the circle. (If all of the st udents are new, this activity is an opportunity to introduce classmates and instructors as a valuable source of support and problem-solving.) \u0088 Continue to ask students who they would tu rn to if they had a problem. Student responses should be praised as they answer the question. For example: Good choice - sounds like you have made a good friend. I'm glad you mentioned Mrs. _________ ___. She's always available to answer any questions, so anyone here can stop by her office. Do you know where her office is? \u0088 Thanks for mentioning me. I love to solve problems, so don't forget that you can bring me your questions. If a student cannot answer the question, pr ovide suggestions, but do not press the student to respond. Point out som eone in the circle who is a good problem-solver. The purpose of the activity is for the students to see that they are all connected and can rely on each other. \u0088 Keep tossing the ball until every student has received the ball of yarn and has had a chance to answer the question. Make sure that students are not wrapping the yarn too tightly around their wrists. Be sensitive in case students feel uncomfortable with the yarn around their wrists because of past experiences in their native countries. If a student feels uncomfortable in the circle, suggest that t he student join the fac ilitator in assisting the group. Mini-Academy Curriculum 24 \u0088 As the yarn \"spider web\" is formed, the facilitator should point out to the students that they have a circle of friends they can turn to if they have a problem. Acknowledge that they have all experienced the same fears, confusion, and excitement about entering a new sc hool, and are connected by similar experiences. \u0088 The facilitator should direct the entire connected circle to do a series of movements together, even tho ugh all of the students are all connected by the yarn. The movements include turning, bending, reaching, etc. These movements may be challenging because they are all connected, but should be fun to try to carry out . (The instructor in the circle may have to demonstrate the motion.) The students should not be conc erned if they get tangled. The instructors should encourage laughter, not perfect ion in maintain ing the circle. In some cases, not all of the students will move in response to the direction because it does not apply to them. As a re sult, the web may get twisted, but the students will still be connected. The facilitat or should point out that even when something gets a little more complicated, t he individuals in that circle are still connected. The facilitator should give the instruct ion for the movement and then ask the follow-up question. Touch the floor with one finger if you have ever gotten confused in your new school. (How did you figure out what to do?) Turn to the right if you have ever worried about being late to class. (What happens when you are late?) Touch your knee if you have found an Am erican food that you really like. (What food did you discover?) Turn to your left if you have tried to make new friends but it was hard to do. (Where can you find new friends?) Take a bow if you have lear ned some words in English. (What English word do you use a lot in school?) Look at the people next to you. Fi nd out their names and shake hands. (Can you turn to anyone in this circle if you have a problem?) Mini-Academy Curriculum 25 FOLLOW -UP DISCUSSION JOURNAL ACTIVITY Show the videos Refugee Student Interviews, Refugee Parent Interviews , and A Day in Elementary School, A Day in Middle School, or A Day in High School , using the Guide to the Videos for discussion. \u0088 The yarn web can then be unraveled by releasing the yarn from the wrists and dropping it to the floor. Then the faci litator and students gather up the yarn. Alternatively, the process of tossing the ball can be reversed, one student at a time. The latter may result in a mass of tangled yarn, but the students will work together to solve the problem. Conduct a discussion that reassures students t hat there are a number of sources for assistance in solving problems, including fellow refugee students. Recognize that the students have had different life expe riences, come from different countries, and have different teachers and cl assmates, but they can always know that there are students in the school who know what they are going through as they adjust to American schools. Encourage the students to reach out to each other. Discuss: \u0082 How are we all connected? \u0082 What can we do to get to know each other better? \u0082 For those of you who have been in school already, who should new students go to if they have a problem? \u0082 How will you connect with someone in this circle when you go back to school? During the Refugee Academy, th e students were encouraged to write or draw in a journal. Some students may have continued the process during school. Distribute journals (or notebooks/notebook paper), pencils , and crayons or colored pencils. Ask the students to respond to the following question in their journals: \u0082 How can I continue to connect with other refugee students and help them to solve problems? Mini-Academy Curriculum 26 Activity #3: LOOP-D-L OOP Grades K-12 (60 minutes for K - 3) (90 minutes for 4 - 12) PURPOSE In this activity, students work together to create paper chains called Loop-D-Loops that represent di versity and connections between students. SUPPLIES \u0088 At least 10 packages of multicolored construction paper \u0088 Large tables or 4-6 desks pushed together to create a table \u0088 Magazines (at least one per student) that can be cut up for the activity. The magazines should have many pictures and advertisements that will remind refugee students of their new lives in Am erica, particularly American schools. Suggested titles, often available at the offices of pediatricians, libraries, and through PTA donations, are: Ranger Rick National Geographic Kids Kids Sports Illustrated Ladybug Family Fun New Moon Jack and Jill Nick Jr. Weekly Reader \u0088 Scissors \u0088 Magic markers or crayons that can be used on construction paper \u0088 Glue, glue stick, or paste \u0088 Optional: Staplers (for making pa per chains, instead of glue) \u0088 Sample paper chain with 3 or 4 links Mini-Academy Curriculum 27 DIRECTIONS \u0088 Explain to the large group that they are going to divide into small groups and make paper chains called Loop-D-Loops, after decorating construction paper with pictures and words from magazines. Demonstrate gluing pictures and words from magazines on three different colors of construction paper , selecting pictures that remind students of school experiences and life in their new country. After gluing the pictures, the instructor should cut the pieces of construction paper into one inch strips, glue or staple loops, and make a paper chain. Explain that each group is to make as many loops as they can. A giant chain called the Loop-D-Loop will be made when all of the lo ops are linked together to form one long chain. Groups can divide up tasks (e.g., picture cutt ers, chain makers, etc.) or everyone can work on the task at once. Remind t he students that when the loops are made the pictures will be cut into strips. \u0088 Encourage the groups to select pi ctures that are personally meaningful. They do not have to justif y the selection of a picture or word, but should not arbitrarily cut out anything in the magazines. The instructor should ask the students about the pictures and words that they have selected: How does that picture/word remind you of school or your new life in America? Since the selected picture will eventually be cut up when the chain loops are created, the focus should be on the selection of the pictures, not on the quality of the craftsmanship. Encourage students to mix up the colors of the loops. \u0088 The instructor should circulate among the groups, encouraging them to work together to complete the task, making su re that all students have the opportunity to participate. If a student is struggling with a task such as cutting paper or finding pictures, guide the student to another activity such as gluing the pictures or making the loops. \u0088 If a group seems to be falling behind in ma king the loops, point out to the entire group that the more loops that ar e created, the longer the Loop-D-Loop. Mini-Academy Curriculum 28 When there are 15-20 minutes left in the activity, stop the activity and have the entire group work together to connect all of the short chains into one long Loop-D-Loop chain. The giant Loop-D-Loop chain can be connected as a circle chain, or kept as one long chain. Ask the students to count the number of links together with the instructor. If possible, hang the giant Loop-D-Loop chai n around the room. Or give each student a section of the chain to decorate their own space at home. FOLLOW -UP DISCUSSION After the links are counted and the Loop-D-Loop is either hung up in the room or distributed to the students, ask t he students the following question: How is this group like the giant Loop-D-Loop? Discuss: \u0082 the strength of the ch ain by linking together \u0082 how small groups of friends (links) can join together with new friends \u0082 how the many colors add beauty and interest to the chain \u0082 the variety of choices of pi ctures and words on the chain \u0082 the skills that it took to make the chain, including communication and teamwork \u0082 the process of working together to create the chain. JOURNAL ACTIVITY During the Refugee Academy, th e students were encouraged to write or draw in a journal. Some students may have continued the process during school. Distribute journals (or notebooks/notebook paper), pencils , and crayons or colored pencils. Ask the students to respond to the following question in their journals: \u0082 What was the best part about making the Loop-D-Loops? Show the videos Refugee Student Interviews, Refugee Parent Interviews , and A Day in Elementary School, A Day in Middle School, or A Day in High School , using the Guide to the Videos for discussion. Mini-Academy Curriculum 29 Activity #4: THUMBS UP, THUMBS DOWN Grades K-12 (45 - 60 minutes) PURPOSE SUPPLIES DIRECTIONS In this activity, students will have the opportunity to share their observations and opinions about their school experiences so far. \u0088 (See list below) \u0088 Journals, notebooks, or notebook paper \u0088 Pencils, colored pencils, crayons, for writing/drawing in journals \u0088 The instructor will need a variet y of objects that are rela ted to school. The objects should be easily recognizable to the student s, with an occasional object that is unusual or unfamiliar. For example: \u008f Test \u008f Homework notebook \u008f Musical instrument \u008f Picture of a school bus, or toy school bus \u008f Clock \u008f Calendar \u008f Art supplies \u008f Library books \u008f Workbooks \u008f Pompoms (if there are cheerleaders in the school or athletic events that students can attend) \u008f Journal \u008f Picture of a favorite teacher, Academic Coach or other adult who is well liked by the students \u008f A piece of fruit \u008f CDs of music groups \u008f Teen magazines \u008f Textbooks \u008f Science/Lab equipment \u008f Math tools (calculator, blocks, ruler, compass, etc.) \u008f Fast food such as French fries \u008f Food from the cafeteria \u008f Deodorant \u008f Toothpaste \u008f Sports equipment \u008f Gym clothes Locker padlock \u008f pass \u008f Report card \u008f Computer Unfamiliar objects: \u0088 A food that the students may not recognize such as a kiwi, avocado, Portobello mushroom, etc. (The instructor c an also include foods that may Mini-Academy Curriculum 30 Mini-Academy Curriculum 31be familiar to the refugee students, but not necessarily to American students) \u0083 A new children's book recommended by the school librarian \u0083 A jar of liquid soap, or other hygiene product \u0083 An educational board game \u0083 The school district Internet policy \u0083 A map showing directions to the guidance counselor or school social worker's office \u0083 Local newspapers \u0083 A brochure to a local college \u0083 A New York State Regents diploma \u0083 Magazines specializing in specific hobbies or topics \u0083 A playbill or program for a school event \u0083 The instructor should explain the meaning of \"thumbs up\" and \"thumbs down,\" demonstrating examples. The group should then practice &thumbs up&and 'thumbs down' with objects that are familiar to them, such as a piece of fruit, a CD of a music group, or a magazine. The instructor asks: Do you like this (name the object)? \u0083 After each object, the instructor should ask the students why they voted the way that they did. If there are students who are voting diffe rently than others, ask them why their opinion differs. For exam ple, a student may vote \"thumbs down\" when a paintbrush is held up, explaining that they do not feel that they are very good in art. Each discussion is an opportunity to support personal expression of views, to provide information ab out the object, and to reassure students and bolster their confidence. The instructor should then hold up objects that may be unfamiliar to the students, prompting discussion. The objects should be selected based on the grade levels of the students. \u0083 The instructor should conclude the acti vity by asking each student to identify something in school that they did not k now about before they entered school, but now they really enjoy. Mini-Academy Curriculum 32 JOURNAL ACTIVITY During the Refugee Academy, th e students were encouraged to write or draw in a journal. Some students may have continued the process during school. Distribute journals (or notebooks/notebook paper), pencils , and crayons or colored pencils. Ask the students to respond to the following question in their journals: \u0083 How can I learn more in school? Show the videos Scenes from School: Refugee Student Interviews, Scenes From School: Refugee Parent Interviews, and A Day at School (Elementary, Middle School, or High School), using the Guide to the Videos for discussion. Mini-Academy Curriculum 33 Grades K-12 (45 - 60 minutes) PURPOSE In this activity, refugee students ha ve the opportunity to review the sources of assistance in the sc hool and are reassured that peers and adults are available to support them. SUPPLIES \u0083 Large enough space for two rows of students \u0083 Journals, notebooks, or notebook paper \u0083 Handout: We Have Your Back! \u0083 Pencils, colored pencils, crayons, for writ ing/drawing in journals and coloring the handout \u0083 Optional: Small hand mirror or pocke t mirror for each student, wrapped in wrapping paper DIRECTIONS \u0083 If there are students wh o are new to the school , the instructor should review the Key Points in Module 8: Getting Help , including distribution of Handout 8-1 Teachers, Handouts 8-2 Academic Coach and 8-3 Parent Note . The students should be given the specific names and loca tions of the adults in the school who are there to assist them. If possible, the instructor should invite teachers, guidance counselors, school law enforcement personnel, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, and other adults from the school to meet the students personally. \u0083 If the students have participated in the Refugee Academy and have been attending school, the instructor should remind students of t he adults who are available to them in the school. \u0083 The instructor can also invite the adults listed previously (e.g., teacher, guidance counselor, etc.) to reconnect the student s to adults they met at the Refugee Academy. ACTIVITY #5: WHO'S GOT YOUR BACK? Mini-Academy Curriculum 34 Discussion Questions Lead an introductory discussion on the questions below, encouraging guests to participate in the discussion and help answer questions. \u0083 What do you like best about school so far? \u0083 What would you change? \u0083 Is there anything that st ill confuses you about school? \u0083 Who do you go to when you have a question about schoolwork? \u0083 Who helps you with your homework? \u0083 What do you do if you have a problem with another student? \u0083 What if you cannot understand an assignment? \u0083 Who can help you with problems in the cafeteria? \u0083 Who can you turn to if you are feeling sad or worried? \u0083 Who knows what you like to do? \u0083 Who knows what you are good at, and when you need help? \u0083 What does it mean when someone says, \"I've got your back? o The instructor should explain that the students and adults in the large group will look out for eac h other and are available to help one another. o New students should know that ex perienced students will guide them and answer questions and \"watch their back.\" o All of the students should be reminded that the Academic Coaches, fellow students, and adults in the school \"have your back.\" \u0083 At the conclusion to the discussion of the last question, the instructor should ask the students to line up in two rows behind ea ch other, with about 2 feet of space between rows. The instructor and adult guests should also be included in the rows. Start the rows in the front of the room. Row 1 = the front row Row 2 = the second row, standing behind the front row Mini-Academy Curriculum 35This exercise will be confusing at first, but the confusion makes it all the more enjoyable. The instructor should be givi ng directions and participating at the same time. The purpose of the exercise is for the parti cipants to realize that everyone in the room \"has their back\" in case they need help. Once the two rows are formed, the instructor should instruct Row 1 to ask together loudly, \"Who's got my back?\" Row 2 should respond loudly, \"We've got your back!\" Row 1 should turn around and face Row 2, then ask the question again. Row 2 responds again. Then Row 1 should quickly move around Row 2 and line up in a row behind them. They should mix the order of their row so that it's not the sa me as it was before. The original Row 2 (now standing in front) asks t ogether, \"Who's got my back?\" and turns around to face the row behind them. The original Row 1 (now standing in the second row) responds quickly with \"We've got your back.\" Then they all quickly move again. The instructor should keep moving the rows behind each other, mixing up the people in the rows and picking up the speed. The instructor can occasionally ask one student to ask the question and the ent ire group should respond \"We've got your back!\" The faster the speed the more amusing t he activity, but no matter what the pace the students should comprehend that they can rely on each other. Finish with a round of applause for each row. \u0083 The instructor should distribute the handout We Have Your Back! for students to color, asking them to describe what t he drawing represents. The instructor should point out that each st udent (circle in the center) can look in any direction and find support, not only from other refugee students and Academic Coaches, but from peers and adults in the school. JOURNAL ACTIVITY During the Refugee Academy, th e students were encouraged to write or draw in a journal. Some students may have continued the process during school. Distribute journals (or notebooks/notebook paper), pencils , and crayons or colored pencils. Ask the students to respond to the following question in their journals: \u0083 Who has my back? Mini-Academy Curriculum 36 Show the videos Scenes from School: Refugee Student Interviews, Scenes From School: Refugee Parent Interviews, and A Day at School (Elementary, Middle School, or High School), using the Guide to the Videos for discussion. OPTIONAL FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITY Grades 7-12: In this optional follow-up activity, students re cognize that they can balance self-reliance and independence with support from helpful adults. A hand mirror or pocket mi rror should be obtained for each student, wrapped as a surprise gift. The instructor should explain to older students that there is one person who the students can depend on to know them the best. The instructor should ask the students who they think that person might be. \u0083 Who knows what you enjoy? \u0083 Who knows what you are good at? \u0083 Who know where you have to work harder? \u0083 Who knows how to solve problems? \u0083 Who knows when it's time to get help from an adult? The students will answer with a variety of responses, including teachers, Academic Coaches, etc. The instructor should distribute the wrappe d pocket mirrors and ask the students to open the presents. Then, asking the same questions again, the instructor should direct the students to look in the mirrors and see if they can find new answer to the questions. Stress that the student s have learned a great deal in a short amount of time and they should be proud of themselves. Note: Although this follow up exercise is about developing confidence and self- esteem, it is very important that older students realize that there are some problems that they cannot solve by themselves. The in structor should discuss the circumstances when students should never be afraid to ask for help, such as: \u0083 difficulties with schoolwork \u0083 concerns about conditions at home \u0083 observations and concerns about safety, personal or school Mini-Academy Curriculum 37 \u0083 emotional problems such as f ear, depression, loneliness, anger \u0083 confusion about school procedures. The instructor should stress that students who have confiden ce are never afraid to reach out to others for information and support. Mini-Academy Curriculum 38 Handout: We have Your Back! Mini-Academy Curriculum 39 Grades K-12 (30 - 45 minutes) PURPOSE In this activity, refugee students address the topic of stress in adjusting to a new school and new culture. SUPPLIES \u0083 Handout : Show How You Feel \u0083 Colored pencils, crayons, or markers \u0083 Journals DIRECTIONS \u0083 During the Refugee Academy, the st udents may have had the opportunity to participate in activities in Module 14: Coping with Stress from the Welcome To Our Schools to curriculum. (The instructor ma y choose to introduce or review the Module 14 activities before conduc ting this activity.) The activities in Module 14: Coping with Stress and this activity What Makes You Happy? What Makes You Sad? can be sensitive because students will be asked to share their fears and worries. The instructor should be aware that dividing the students into pairs or small groups may be more comfortable for the students, rather than asking them to express themselves in a large group. \u0083 For all students, regardless of their ti me of enrollment in school, the handout Show How You Feel can be a starting point for discussion. Distribute pencils, colored pencils, and crayons, and ask the student s to quietly complete the handout. Circulate, observing what makes the st udents happy and what makes them sad. \u0083 Either divide the students into pairs or small groups to discuss their pictures, or share instructor observations with the ent ire class (without identifying specific pictures). \u0083 The goal of the discussions should alwa ys be reassurance that the students have similar concerns and they can talk to each other and adults in the school about their fears and worries. The instructor s hould emphasize the role of the Academic Coach in providing support, and school and community resources that will help students. ACTIVITY #6: WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY ? WHAT MAKES YOU SAD? Mini-Academy Curriculum 40 JOURNAL ACTIVITY During the Refugee Academy, th e students were encouraged to write or draw in a journal. Some students may have continued the process during school. Distribute journals (or notebooks/notebook paper), pencils , and crayons or colored pencils. Ask the students to respond to the fo llowing questions in their journals: \u0083 How do you feel about school? \u0083 Who can you talk to about how you feel? Show the videos Scenes from School: Refugee Student Interviews, Scenes From School: Refugee Parent Interviews, and A Day at School (Elementary, Middle School, or High School), using the Guide to the Videos for discussion. Mini-Academy Curriculum 41 WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY? WHAT MAKES YOU SAD? Handout: Show How You Feel Mini-Academy Curriculum 42 Grades 5-12 (60 - 90 minutes) PURPOSE In this activity, refugee students ha ve the opportunity to show where they are from on a large world map, as well as the travels that they took to get to t he United States. Note: The emphasis in this activity should always be on the route of travel. Some refugee students may be uncomfortable recalli ng their travel experiences, and some younger students may not remember their native countries or their travels to the United States. Instructors should determine if the students can participate comfortably in this activity. SUPPLIES \u0083 Large wall map of the world on a bul letin board, with room for a display \u0083 Colored yarn \u0083 Camera or video camera \u0083 Computer or tape recorder \u0083 Pushpins DIRECTIONS The end result of this activity will be several strands of yarn stretching on a map from the native countries of the re fugee students to locations in New York State. The yarn will not show a di rect route, but will follow the travel steps taken by the refugee students. Surrounding the map will be photographs and stories of the travels of the refugee students. (If the instructor determines that recalling the travels may make so me students uncomfortable, the yarn can show a direct connect ion from a native country to New York State. The photographs and stories can be about the students and their current interests.) \u0083 The instructor should begin by showing the students a large map of the world, identifying the location of New York State. ACTIVITY #7: WHERE ARE YOU FROM? Mini-Academy Curriculum 43\u0083 The instructor should then ask each student to identify the name of their home country or the area of the world that they are from . Some students may be able to find the spot on the map. The instru ctors should put a pushpin in the country and then attach a piece of colored yarn (about 2 yards) to the pushpin. The student's name should be placed next to t he pushpin. If there ar e a large number of students, or if the pushpins are clustered on one area of the map, each pushpin can be assigned a number. A key to the numbers can be placed next to the map, with the names of the students. (For example, #1 could be Maria, #2 Mohammed, etc.) \u0083 The instructors, with assistance from the Academic Coaches, ESL teachers, and translators, should interview the students abo ut their travels to the United States. The emphasis should be on the route that refugee students took, not on the trials and tribulations of leaving their native country and working their way toward the United States. The interviews can be recorded on a computer or on a tape recorder and then transcribed. Sample interview questions can be: o What country did you live in before y ou left for the United States? Where was the first place that you went to after you started your travels? Where did you go after that? o How did you travel? (bus, wagon, walking, plane, train, etc.) o Where did you live before you came to this town? Some students will not remember t he route that they took, or the countries that they travel ed through to move toward the United States. The instructor's goal is to be able to stretch the piece of yarn from the pushpi n to the United States, with additional pushpins along the way, marking the route of travel. For example, a student may have gone through 3 countries in Africa before flying to London, then to New York City, then to another city in New York State. The yarn should show the route. (If the student is not sure, then a direct route to the United States can be shown with the piece of yarn.) Instructors should always keep in mi nd that remembering the past may be difficult for some students, so emphasis should always be on plotting the route on the map, and not on the chal lenges of leaving home. If remembering the travel experiences will be stressful to the students, then the yarn should simply go from the native country to New York State. \u0083 The instructor should then take a photograph of each student, with permission from the student. (Instructors should recogni ze that in some cultures the taking of photographs is not allowed.) The photographs, labeled with the name of the students, should be displayed around the map, each with a par agraph that describes the route of travel. Those who view the display should be able to l ook at the photo of the student, read the Mini-Academy Curriculum 44paragraph about their travels, and then follow their route by finding their pushpin and following the yarn to New York State. \u0083 Instructors may wish to videotape the students talki ng about their travels, and then show the video on a television located next to the map. \u0083 The display can also be a portable ex hibit that can be moved to different classrooms so that many students get t he chance to discuss what travels were necessary for the refugee student s to come to America. Discussion Questions After the display is complet ed, the instructor can discuss the following with the refugee students and share these discussion ques tions with classroom teachers: \u0083 What countries are the students from? \u0083 How did they travel? \u0083 Where did the students live befor e they came to our town? \u0083 Who traveled the farthest? Who had many stops along the way? \u0083 What was it like to travel so far? JOURNAL ACTIVITY During the Refugee Academy, th e students were encouraged to write or draw in a journal. Some students may have continued the process during school. Distribute journals (or notebooks/notebook paper), pencils , and crayons or colored pencils. Ask students to respond to the follo wing question in their journals: \u0083 Do you plan on traveling when you grow up? Where would you go and how would you travel? Show the videos Scenes from School: Refugee Student Interviews, Scenes From School: Refugee Parent Interviews, and A Day at School (Elementary, Middle School, or High School), using the Guide to the Videos for discussion. Mini-Academy Curriculum 45 Grades K-12 (120 minutes) PURPOSE In this activity, refugee students have the opportunity to create a scrapbook that will inform newcomer re fugee students about what to expect in American schools. SUPPLIES \u0083 Cameras (at least one fo r each group of 4 students) \u0083 Scrapbook album with 20+ pages \u0083 Glue/paste \u0083 Colored markers \u0083 Computer \u0083 Computer software for printing photographs (or other source for printing photos) \u0083 Journal Optional: \u0083 Scrapbook supplies, availa ble from craft stores, online sites and stores that specialize in scrapbooking or scrapbook club s (stickers, colored paper shapes, printed letters, illustrations, labels, etc.) Instructors may want to invite a loca l scrapbook expert to show examples of how scrapbook pages can be enhanc ed with scrapbooking supplies. \u0083 Video A Day at School (Elementary, Middle School, or High School version) DIRECTIONS \u0083 The instructor should explain to the refugee students that they are going to be making a scrapbook that will be shown to new refugee students as they enroll in school. The scrapbook will depict refugee students participating in school activities, with a written description t hat provides additional information. The ACTIVITY #8: SCRAPBOOK FOR NEWCOMERS Mini-Academy Curriculum 46scrapbook will consist of photographs, drawn illustrations, and decorations that enhance the photographs. \u0083 The students can work in pairs or in small groups, depending on the number of available cameras. The students will be res ponsible for taking pi ctures of routine school activities, such as: o Using a locker o Changing into sneakers for physical education o Loading a backpack o Filling out notebook paper with name and date o Raising hands in class o Paying for lunch in the cafeteria o Cheering for a sports team. \u0083 The instructor should ask the students to generate a list of activities that they would like to photograph, reminding the student s that they should capture basic activities that may be unfamiliar to the newcomers. \u0083 The instructor may want to show the large group the video A Day in School (selecting the Elementary, Middle School, or High School version) for examples of what can be included in the scrapbook. \u0083 The instructor should emphasize that the students are not to interfere with ongoing school activities and should gain permission from other students as they take the pictures. Teachers and administrators can also be included in the scrapbook, as long as permission has been granted to take photographs. \u0083 The instructor should monitor the students as they cover the school grounds taking pictures. The students should be able to explain what they are doing, and should concentrate on limiting the photographs to the purpose of the project. The instructor should encour age the refugee students to include themselves in the photos. Once the photos have been collected, select ed, and printed, the organization of the scrapbook should be developed. The students can determine the sequence of the photos, and then divide up the pages to be decorated. They may wish to show sections such as transportation , classroom activities , and after-school sports , or they may wish to show the timeline of a school day. \u0083 The instructor can divide up the pages among the students, providing colored paper, markers, stickers, and scrapbooking mate rials, if available. The students should glue the photographs, write or dict ate information about what is shown in the photo, and decorate t he page with related illustrations, vocabulary, and other decorations. The students should include their names on an Author Page, as well as an introduction that explains the purpose of the scrapbook. Mini-Academy Curriculum 47 FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITY \u0083 As a follow-up activity, the refugee students who created t he scrapbook can be responsible for meeting i ndividually with newcomers and showing the pages of the scrapbook, to help the students a cclimate to their new school. The instructor should make sure that school administrators, guidance counselors, Academic Coaches, and teacher s are aware of the scrapbook as a resource for discussing school with newcomers. Discussion Questions After the activity is completed, the inst ructor can discuss the following questions with the refugee students: \u0083 What would you want new students to k now about the school? Did you include it in the scrapbook? \u0083 Would you enjoy making a scrapbook of your own? What would you include in the scrapbook? (Students can make scrapbooks about their native country and family traditions, new friends, life in the new school, plans for th e future, favorite hobbies, etc.) JOURNAL ACTIVITY During the Refugee Academy, th e students were encouraged to write or draw in a journal. Some students may have continued the process during school. Distribute journals (or notebooks/notebook paper), pencils , and crayons or colored pencils. \u0083 If I were sharing the scrapbook with a new student, what would I want to tell the student as we looked at the scrapbook pages? Show the videos Scenes from School: Refugee Student Interviews, Scenes From School: Refugee Parent Interviews, and A Day at School (Elementary, Middle School, or High School), using the Guide to the Videos for discussion. Mini-Academy Curriculum 48 Grades 1-12 (60 minutes) PURPOSE In this activity students will have the opportunity to create a personal assignment notebook that will help them organize their studying, and will reward themselves for completing assignments on time. SUPPLIES \u0083 3-ring binder for each student \u0083 Blank 3-hole-punched paper, any color \u0083 Handout: Assignment Sheet (Monday - Friday) \u0083 Colored pens, pencils, or markers, crayons Optional: Colored stars or other stickers DIRECTIONS \u0083 The instructor should make one set of the handout Assignment Sheet (Monday - Friday) per student and ask the students to insert the handout pages into a 3-ring binder. \u0083 The instructor should then explain to the students that good study habits begin with writing down assi gnments. Using the Assignment Sheet , the instructor can demonstrate how the form is filled out every day for each class. \u0083 The instructor should discuss the impor tance of developing habits when writing down assignments. Students who develop the habit of writing down every assignment as soon as it is given are more organized and prepared for class. \u0083 The instructor should explain when and how teachers will give assignments. Some teachers will distribute a syllabus, some will write assignments on the board, and some will announce assignments at the end of class. Students in grades 1-12 will have assignments to complete either in class or as homework. \u0083 The instructor can review the Key Ideas in Module 9: Study Skills in the Refugee Academy Curriculum . ACTIVITY #9: COMPLETING ASSIGNMENTS IS REWARDING ! Mini-Academy Curriculum 49\u0083 The instructor should discuss the importance of the students taking responsibility for checking their assi gnment notebook every night and recording the status of their assi gnments. Do they need to a sk for help the next day? Checking the Ask for Help box will remind them to c onsult with teachers, tutors, ESL teachers, or Academic Coaches. Is there more to do on the assignment? Checking the More to Do box and drawing or writ ing a note about what else needs to be done, will remind students that they have not yet completed the assignment. For new students, the concept of many di fferent subjects and teachers, resulting in many different types of assignment s, may be bewildering. The instructor should reassure the students that if they record their assignments daily, they will see how they can keep track of their work and monitor deadlines. \u0083 The instructor can guide t he group in completing the handout Assignment Sheet with imaginary assignments that the instructor provides. \u0083 After discussing and practicing the recording of assignments, the instructor should discuss the value of establishing personal incentives and awards for completing assignments. Many students re ly on teachers and parents to monitor their assignments, check their homewor k, and reward them when they have done well on their schoolwork. If the students establish their own reward system, they are more inclined to be inve sted in completing the work so that they can earn a reward. The instructor should point out that the students themselves should assume the responsibility for keeping track of their assignments and completing them on ti me, and should develop their own personal reward system. In this case, the reward system s hould be the development of a personal symbol that is recorded on the Assignment Sheet . Every time an assignment is completed, the student checks the box next to Done! and then draws their own personal symbol next to the Reward box. The goal is to have an Assignment Sheet covered with reward symbols. Suggested symbols are: o The word \"congratulations\" in a native language o o o A star, exclamation poin t, smile, sun, or other cheerful symbol o A drawing of something pers onal such as a family pet or favorite flower Mini-Academy Curriculum 50o A series of colored shapes that represent the type of assignment, such as a blue triangle for easy work, a yellow circle for fun assignments, and a red square for work that was hard, but finished on time. o Although a written symbol may not seem like a significant reward to adults, it is important to the students because they get to determine if they have earned it. The students can develop internal motivation, rather than relying on adults to determine whether they deserve recognition or not. The students should be encouraged to shar e their personal reward system with their teachers and Academic Coaches, so t hat their progress in achieving the rewards can be acknowledged and moni tored. Emphasis should always be on the tracking and completion of the work, to encourage the development of organizational skills so that students c an get their assignments done on time. Classroom teachers can work with the students on the quality of the work, encouraging them not only to get the assignments do ne on time, but to make sure that they are done carefully and accurately. If available, the instructor can also pr ovide stickers, gold stars, pencils, and other forms of rewards that can be gi ven to students. However, the personal symbols on the Assignment Sheet should be stressed so that the students look forward to rewarding themselves, rather than waiting for the instructor to check on their completion of assignments and then distribute tangible rewards. The ultimate goal is for the students to feel motivated to complete their assignments because they feel a sense of accomp lishment, not because they will receive something from the teacher. After discussing the process of recording a nd rewarding assignments, the instructor should ask the students to create a cover page for their 3-ring binder. They can decorate a blank sheet of 3-hole-punched paper to insert in the beginning of their 3-ring assignment binder. The students should be encouraged to include pictures of their personal reward systems in t he illustrations on their cover pages. Discussion Questions \u0083 When will you write dow n your assignments? \u0083 What will you do if you don't understand the assignment? \u0083 Where will you get help with your assignments? \u0083 What will be your reward symbol for completing an assignment? \u0083 Will you reward yourself if you hurried through the assignment and did not work your hardest? \u0083 Who will you tell about your reward system? Mini-Academy Curriculum 51 JOURNAL ACTIVITY During the Refugee Academy, th e students were encouraged to write or draw in a journal. Some students may have continued the process during school. Distribute journals (or notebooks/notebook paper), pencils , and crayons or colored pencils. \u0083 When will I write down my a ssignments, and when will I check to make sure that I have completed all of my work? \u0083 Where will I go for help if I have trouble co mpleting my assignments, so that I don't fall too far behind? Show the videos Scenes from School: Refugee Student Interviews, Scenes From School: Refugee Parent Interviews, and A Day at School (Elementary, Middle School, or High School), using the Guide to the Videos for discussion.

SUPPLIES \u0083 Six volunteer non-refugee students from t he local school who are willing to role- play. (Instructors may want to invite a theatre class or Dram a Club to assist with this activity.) \u0083 Classroom setup to be used as a stage setting for role-playing (4-6 desks, chalkboard, teacher's desk, doorway) with enough room to simulate a hallway and space for gym or recess \u0083 Props for the role-playing (determined by the actors) \u0083 Locker set up in class (or a large box des igned to simulate a locker), overfilled and disorganized DIRECTIONS \u0083 The instructor should meet with six non-refugee students who have volunteered to role-play examples of school rules. The volunteer students will be demonstrating the incorrect way to behav e in school, followed by the correct way to behave. The volunteer students should know that they are helping refugee students to review basic school rules. The emphasis should be on having fun while informing refugee students about what is expected of them in school. The instructor will provid e the skit topics (see below). The volunteer students should assume the roles of teacher, students, and principal. Each acting assignment (see below) should be a skit, demonstrating the inappropriate way of behaving in school and then the appropriate behavior. ACTIVITY #10: SCHOOL RULES THEATER Mini-Academy Curriculum 58It is important that the volunteer actors understand that they can speak aloud in English, but their acting should be heavily dependent on acting out the scene because the refugee students may not understand English. The volunteer actors can exaggerate their behavio rs, expressions, and reactions. \u0083 The volunteer actors may need time before the activity to work out their skits, or they can take a few minutes to plan ri ght before they show each skit. They may also wish to gather props such as textbooks, a whistle for gym class, chewing gum, etc. \u0083 Before the skits begin, the instructor should ask all of the volunteers and the refugee students to introduce themselves. T hen the instructor can explain that the volunteer students are going to demonstrate school rules. \u0083 The instructor should read the following acting assignments, one at a time. The instructor should ask the refugee students to decide which of the skits depict students following school rules. Refugee students who are experienced in attending an American school may be familiar with what is appr opriate, but new refugee students will be learning the school rules for the first time. Acting Assignments: 1. Show how you are NOT to enter a cla ssroom, sit in class, raise your hand, and disrupt class by chewing gum, interrupting, and distracting other students. One or more students can misbehave while the others are the teacher and other students. 2. Now show the appropriate way to behave in class. 3. Show the inappropriate way to behave in the hallway and maintain a locker. (Note: The instructor will have to explain the part of the classroom that is to be the stage for the hallwa y.) The locker is overstuffed and disorganized. The principal is walking down the noisy, rambunctious hallway. 4. Now demonstrate how to organize the locker and behave appropriately in the hallway. 5. Show how students shoul d NOT behave in gym class, with a student not participating, another being too rough, and another student hiding the ball or generally disrupting the activity. One student should be clearly left out of the activity. The \"coach\" can keep tr ying to get the attention of the gym class. 6. Now show how students play together effectively as a team and include new students. 7. Show how a student is completely disorganized. 8. Now demonstrate how different students keep themselves organized with binders, backpacks, assi gnment notebooks, etc. Mini-Academy Curriculum 59 Discussion Questions \u0083 What are some school rule s that you learned today? \u0083 What will you do when you are not sure about school rules? JOURNAL ACTIVITY During the Refugee Academy, th e students were encouraged to write or draw in a journal. Some students may have continued the process during school. Distribute journals (or notebooks/notebook paper), pencils , and crayons or colored pencils. \u0083 What school rules surprised you? Show the videos Scenes from School: Refugee Student Interviews, Scenes From School: Refugee Parent Interviews, and A Day at School (Elementary, Middle School, or High School), using the Guide to the Videos for discussion. Mini-Academy Curriculum 60 Grades K-12 (60 minutes) PURPOSE In this activity, students have the opportunity to reflect upon what they have learned so far in their new school, and share what they have learned with their families. SUPPLIES \u0083 Multiple copies of each of the handouts: Look What I Can Do! (Handouts in stacks on a table) \u0083 Colored pencils, crayons, markers \u0083 Journal DIRECTIONS \u0083 The instructor should begin the activity by asking the students about what they have learned in their new school, such as: o How the cafeteria works o What subjects are taught o What supplies they need o What the classroom rules are o What teachers want and do o How to behave in the halls o What the school rules are o Techniques for staying organized o What skills they have o What interests and talents they did not know that they had o How technology is used o How families are involved in the school. ACTIVITY #11: LOOK WHAT I CAN DO! Mini-Academy Curriculum 61 \u0083 The instructor should ask the student s to gather around the table of handouts and look at each handout carefully. Then each student should be asked to select the handouts that depict something new that they hav e learned about in school. The students can select as many handouts as are relevant, or the instructor can limit the number of handouts that the students can take. \u0083 The instructor should explain to the st udents that they are to color the handouts and then take them home to share with thei r families, showing examples of what they have learned in their new school Discussion Questions \u0083 Show me the handouts that you se lected. What have you learned? \u0083 What will you tell your family about what you have learned? JOURNAL ACTIVITY During the Refugee Academy, th e students were encouraged to write or draw in a journal. Some students may have continued the process during school. Distribute journals (or notebooks/notebook paper), pencils , and crayons or colored pencils. \u0083 Beyond the pictures that I colored, w hat else have I learned in my new school? Show the videos Scenes from School: Refugee Student Interviews, Scenes From School: Refugee Parent Interviews, and A Day at School (Elementary, Middle School, or High School), using the Guide to the Videos for discussion.

OBJECTIVES The objectives of the Parent Programs are to: \u0083 Reassure parents that the Refugee Academy and the Academic Coaches will provide guidanc e and support to refugee students. \u0083 Inform parents of the goals and ac tivities of the Refugee Academy. \u0083 Inform parents that even if they do not understand what their children are learning in school, they can be involv ed in education by showing interest, encouragement, and support for hard work and achievement. \u0083 Provide accurate information about the expectations and procedures of American schools, and refute myths and misinformation. \u0083 Build communication between school personnel and parents. \u0083 Build communication among refugee parents. \u0083 Inform parents about school and community resources for students and families. \u0083 Inform parents about school-relat ed paperwork that will facilitate enrollment and preparation for school. \u0083 Inform parents about parental responsibilities in preparing students for school. Parent Program 1 - Welcome 2 FORMAT The format of the Parent Program s should be a combination of presentations by the Academic Coaches and other school personnel, tours of the school, and discussions related to the details of preparing students for school. The Academic Coaches should organize the programs, selecting the activities that will be included so that they ar e connected to the Refugee Academy. The activities of the Parent Progr ams can be implemented in any order, depending upon the amount of time availabl e. The activities selected may be determined by: \u0083 the comfort level of the parents and t heir familiarity with the school and the Refugee Academy \u0083 the number of languages that need to be translated during the program \u0083 the needs and concerns of the parents \u0083 access to school facilities \u0083 the topics and questions that have been raised by the students in the Academy \u0083 the number of parents attending and their connections with each other \u0083 the arrangements that hav e been made for child care and transportation. The Academic Coaches and other present ers can determine the pace of the Parent Programs, recognizing that modification of the agenda may have to be made as the programs progre ss. They should allow significant time for questions and for a general review of the mate rial that has been covered during the program. The presenters should keep in mind that the background of the participants may range from signific ant experience with formal education programs to no experience at all. It is also important to recognize that the information provided in the Parent Programs can be overwhelming and confusing to parents, especially if they are trying to learn new terminology, listen to the translator, and understand what the Academic Coaches are explaining. Teachers of English as a Second Language and translators will be critical parti cipants in the presentations. Repeatedly reassure parents that the information will be reviewed with the students and at the second parent meeting. Provide contact information, and make it clear that parents can call the Academic Coaches at any time. Parent Program 1 - Welcome 3 Parent Program 1: Welcome Supplies (Parent Program 1) 1) Student Handout 1-1: Please Visit Our School should be distributed to students in the Refugee Academy during t he first session. Follow up with phone calls and a second copy of the handout to achieve parent attendance. 2) Post signs with pictures and arrows outside of the school and throughout the hallways to direct parents to the Pa rent Program. Volunteer greeters and translators would be especially helpful in welcoming parent s to the Parent Program. 3) If possible, provide refreshments. 4) Handouts (provided at the end of Parent Program 1.) Student Handouts (in this order) Number & Grade Level of Handout Name of Handout 8-2 (grades K-5, 6-8, 9-12) Academic 13-2 (grades K-5) School Events Parent Handouts 1 Academic Coach Information 2 Tardy Note 3 Absent Note Parent Program 1 - Welcome 4 5) Teacher-prepared supply lists for September (if available) 6) School map, modified with illustrations 7) Sample school lunches 8) Video A Day In School (Elementary, Middle School, or High School) 9) Video Refugee Parent Interviews Parent Program 1 - Welcome 5 ACTIVITIES \u0083 Discuss Parent Handout #1 : Academic Coach Contact Information . \u0083 Invite parents to introduce them selves, if it seems appropriate. Parents who are familiar with the sc hool and the Academic Coaches, or have had a chance to meet other par ents, may be willing to introduce themselves. Some parents, however, may be nervous or wary, and unwilling to speak up. Make the introductions informal by asking each individual to give their name and their native country and t hen finding the country on the map. Follow up with school-related questions, such as: Have you ever been in this school? Have you had a chance to meet any other parents? Was the room easy to find? \u0083 Distribute maps of the schools that the children will be attending. Use a chalkboard, overhead, or LCD projector to point out different aspects of the school facilities. If possible, add illustrat ions to the rooms on the map to show the purpose of the rooms (e.g., science equipment, swimming pool, basketball hoop, desks, mu sical instruments). The maps should be used to familiari ze the parents with the variety of educational programs offer ed by the school district. The maps can also be used as a guide when parents tour the school. \u0083 Show the video A Day In Elementary School (or Middle School or High School , using the Guide to the Videos . Prior to the viewing of the video, suggest scenes that the parents should look for such as school supplies, classroom activities, and lunch in the cafeteria. After showing the video, highlight scenes that would be of interest to the parents and discuss any questions that they may have about a day in school. \u0083 Review the packet of Student Handouts (see Supplies) that have been used in the Refugee Academy. Explain that students have received the same handouts and the parents can use them to discuss with their children how they all can prepare for the new school. PARENT PROGRAM 1 Parent Program 1 - Welcome 6 \u0083 Show the video Refugee Parent Interviews. Discuss questions from the Guide to the Videos . \u0083 Discuss Parent Handout 2: Tardy Note and 3: Absent Note . Explain the school policies about punc tuality and attendance. \u0083 Discuss how parents can facilitate the development of student friendships , as discussed with the students in Module 2. The primary role of the parents, especially with secondary level students, is to inform their children that it takes time to build new friendships, they should choose their friends carefully, and they have a better chance of developing friendships if they participate in a number of school activities. Discuss opportunities for after-s chool and community activities. \u0083 Discuss the school lunch program , explaining to pare nts that the students can either bring their lunch in a lunch box or bag, or can purchase all or part of their lunch at school. Discuss t he paperwork required for free lunch, explaining how the parents can get assistance in completing the forms. Emphasize that the info rmation is confidential. Show the parents examples of typi cal school lunches that might be served in the cafeteria. Discuss the social aspects of the cafeteria and how the students may be very clear about what they bring for lunch. \u0083 Discuss the different forms of transportation available to students going to and from school, and when they att end after-school and athletic events. Stress that a strict tran sportation schedule is followed by school and city busses, and students are expect ed to be at school on time. If possible pass out bus schedules or specific information about the bus or subway that each child will be taking to school. Describe the availability of a \"late bus\" if the school offers bussing for after-school activities. Explain th at occasionally students will go on a bus or a class field trip and will need parental permission. Some parents will be literate in their own language, or many languages including English. They will be able to take notes as the Academic Coaches are explaining the respons ibilities of parents. Other parents will not only be unfamiliar with the English language, they may not be literate in their native language. Draw illustrations on the board that parents can use to remind them of tasks t hey need to do in order to help their children prepare for school. Parent Program 1 - Welcome 7\u0083 Tour the school building , even if it is not the building that the students will be attending.

Parents who did not attend the first program may need to be brought up to date about information that was covered in the first session. They may also need a tour of the school. Plan for shor t follow-up meetings with parents who missed Parent Program 1. 2) Even though parents may have attended Pa rent Program 1, post signs with pictures and arrows outside of the school and throughout the hallways, to direct parents to the Parent Program. Volunt eer greeters and translators would be especially helpful in welcoming parents to the Parent Program. 3) If possible, provide refreshments. 4) Handouts (provided at the end of Parent Program 2.) Student Handouts (in this order) Number & Grade Level of Handout Name of Handout 8-1 K-5, 6-8, 9-12) Stay Healthy 7-1 K-5, You 6-8, 9-12) Zero Tolerance 5) Video: Refugee Parent Interviews Parent Program 2 - Ready for School 4 ACTIVITIES \u0083 Invite parents to introduce themselves , even if they attended the first Parent Program. The parents who ar e familiar with the school and the Academic Coaches and have had a chanc e to meet other parents, may be willing to introduce themselves. Some parents, however, may still be nervous or wary, and unwilling to speak up. Make the introductions informal. Fo r each introduction, mention to the parent a topic that has been cove red in the Refugee Academy. For example: Tonight we are going to talk about the school rules that we have been discussing in class. Your children have been talking about their interests and talents, and we have been discussing activities they can do after school. We want to talk about home work tonight, so that you will be prepared when your children have schoolwork to do when they get home from school. (Define \"homework.\") \u0083 Distribute the packet of Student Handouts and explain each handout. Stop often to ask for questions, or to review the information if parents look befuddled. Review of the handouts can be tedious and confusing, especially if multiple translations are occurring while the Academic Coaches are presenting. To break up the presentation, pause often to ask specific questions, such as: Have any of your children shown an interest in sports? Have you seen the (YMCA, Boys/Gi rls Club, etc.) in your neighborhood? Do your children like American food? If Module 8 has been covered in the Re fugee Academy, ask parents if the students brought home Handout 8-3: Parent Note for the parents to sign. Discuss the contents of the handout and complete it together, if necessary. PARENT PROGRAM 2 Parent Program 2 - Ready for School 5 Handout 10-1: Taking Tests may require more di scussion time, as the Academic Coaches may want to descri be specific placement tests that the students will be taking (or have taken). Emphasize that the purpose of the tests is to assist in determini ng the best educational approach for the students so that they can achieve in their new school. Explain to parents that they can meet with the teac hers and Academic Coaches to go over any test results. Handout 12-1: Zero Tolerance covers a particularly serious subject. The parents may be uncomfort able with the topic (and the pictures on the handouts). The focus of the discussion should be on how parents can inform their children about what is not tolerated in American schools, and how they can stay safe. \u0083 Show the video Refugee Parent Interviews . Discuss questions from the Guide to the Videos . \u0083 Tour the area of the school that has computers , describing to the parents the school policies about the use of computers. Inform parents about the availability of free computers in the community (e.g., library, recreation centers) and discuss the importance of monitoring computer use. \u0083 Observe classes and athletic events if they are being held in the school building during the Parent Program. Discuss that the programs are free if they are sponsored by the school. Community programs usually require a fee that can be reduced or eliminated if requested. Student participants in extracurricular programs may need uni forms, snacks, permission slips, and equipment. Reassure parents about supervision and safety.

OBJECTIVES The objectives of the Parent Programs are to: \u0083 Reassure parents that the Refugee Academy and the Academic Coaches will provide gui dance and support to refugee students. \u0083 Inform parents of the goals and activi ties of the Refugee Mini-Academies, held throughout the school year. \u0083 Inform parents that even if they do not understand what their children are learning in school, they can be involv ed in education by showing interest, encouragement, and support for hard work and achievement. \u0083 Provide accurate information about the expectations and procedures of American schools, and refute myths and misinformation. \u0083 Build communication between school personnel and parents. \u0083 Build communication among refugee parents. \u0083 Inform parents about school and community resources for students and families. \u0083 Inform parents about school-relat ed paperwork that will facilitate enrollment and preparation for school. \u0083 Inform parents about parental responsibilities in preparing students for school. Parent Program 3 2 FORMAT The format of Parent Program 3 should be a combination of presentations by the Academic Coaches and other school personnel, tours of the school, and discussions related to the details of preparing students for school. The Academic Coaches should organize the programs, selecting the activities that will be included so that they are connected to the Refugee Mini-Academy. The activities of Parent Program 3 can be implem ented in any order, depending upon the amount of time available. The ac tivities selected may be determined by: \u0083 the comfort level of the parents and t heir familiarity with the school and the Refugee Academy \u0083 the number of languages that need to be translated during the program \u0083 the needs and concerns of the parents \u0083 access to school facilities \u0083 the topics and questions that have been raised by the students in the Academy \u0083 the number of parents attending and their connections with each other \u0083 the arrangements that hav e been made for child care and transportation. The Academic Coaches and other presenter s can determine the pace of Parent Program 3, recognizing that modifica tion of the agenda may have to be made as the programs progress. They should allow significant ti me for questions and for a general review of the material that has been covered during the program. The presenters should keep in mind that the background of the participants may range from significant experience with formal education programs to no experience at all. It is also important to recognize that the information pr ovided in Parent Program 3 can be overwhelming and confusi ng to parents, especially if they are trying to learn new terminology, listen to the translator, and understand what the Academic Coaches are explaining. Teachers of English as a Second Language and translators will be critical parti cipants in the presentations. Repeatedly reassure parents that the information will be reviewed with the students and at the second parent meeting. Provide contact information, and make it clear that parents can call the Academic Coaches at any time. Parent Program 3 3 Parent Program 3: School Check-Up Supplies (Parent Program 1) 1) Student Handout 1-1: Please Visit Our School should again be distributed to students in the Refugee Academy prior to the third Parent Program. Follow up with phone calls and a second copy of t he handout to achieve parent attendance. Parents who did not attend the first or second program may need to be brought up to date about information that was cove red in the earlier sessions. They may also need a tour of the school. Plan for short follow-up meetings with parents who missed earlier Pa rent Programs. 2) Even though parents may have attended Pa rent Programs 1 and 2, post signs with pictures and arrows outside of t he school and throughout the hallways to direct parents to the Parent Program. Volunteer translators would be especially helpful in welcoming parent s to the Parent Program. 3) If possible, provide refreshments. 4) For parents who have not attended a Parent Program, share the student and par ent handouts that have been distributed earlier. They are an effective means of reviewing information about school rules, schedules, and supplies, and show important messages abou t health and hygiene, after school activities, and school-home communication. 5) Arrange for new parents to see the video A Day in Elementary School (or Middle School or High School). Instructors may also choose to show videos from different grade levels so that parents are informed about the activities of all of the students in the school district. 6) Gather pictures from magazines that show friends interacting. The pictures will be used in a discussion about friendship, so the friendship of the children in the photos should be self-explanatory. 7) Highlight the key points to s hare with parents from the article Helping Your Child With Homework on page 9 of this Welcome to Our Schools Parent Program 3. 8) Using a globe or world map, identify t he native countries of parents attending Parent Program 3. Talk about how t he diverse backgrounds of the students enhances the educational program for a ll of the students in the district. Parent Program 3 4 ACTIVITIES \u0083 Invite parents to introduce themselves , even if they attended the first two Parent Programs. The parents who are familiar with the school and the Academic Coaches and have had a chance to meet other parents may be willing to greet other parents. Make the introductions informal, but respect the tradi tions of different cultures. Explain to the parents the topics that will be covered in Parent Program 3: Tonight we are going to ta lk about how your children are adjusting to school. They have been faced with a lot of new experiences and have done very well. We will talk tonight about how they can enjoy new friendships and keep up on their schoolwork. It may be necessary to take questions i mmediately, in case parents have pressing concerns. Do not wait until t he end of the program if there is a topic that most of th e parents obviously need to discuss. (Maintain confidentiality; do not identify specif ic students.) Keep reassuring parents that there are a number of adults in the school system responsible for helping the children and their families adj ust to their new life in America. \u0083 Discuss how refugee students can make friends in a variety of ways, including in class, on the bus or playground, in loca l neighborhoods, in extra-curricular activities, and in community organizations. Share pictures of friends (cut from ma gazines) so that parents get a visual image of the theme of friendship. Point out to parents that younger ch ildren tend to make friends more quickly, connecting over similar interest s or shared activities. Teachers in the elementary grades often assign \"buddies\" to assist new students in adjusting to the classroom routine. Middle school and high school students tend to be more exclusive, and it is difficult for new students to enter into existing groups of friends or friendships that are well established. Friendships in grades 6-12 can also be fleeting, when a word or a look can quickly change a relationship. Friendships also change as students become adolescents and relationships with the other gender influence communication, interests, attitudes, and priorities. PARENT PROGRAM 3 Parent Program 3 5For many refugee students it is not only difficult to comprehend the nuances of relationships, but they do not know how to relate to their peers. They often do not know how to in terpret communicati on between fellow students and are confused and fr ustrated. They may feel socially isolated, or may deliberately isolate themselves from others so that they do not have to struggle with the pressure of trying to make new friends. Some refugee students may decide that friendships are far more interesting than schoolwork. They may connect quickly with a variety of friends, or may be absorbed into a gr oup that welcomes a new friend. These new friends could be well-in tentioned, but a distraction. And then there are the bullies. Th ere will be students who will tease or even physically bully refugee students. They may be encouraged by their peers, or may lead others in harassing new students. Refugee student s may handle this by ignoring them and forming new friendships, or they may feel scared and overwhelmed, perhaps even unwilling to go to school. The new friends could be a serious negat ive influence and, although they may feel welcoming and supportive to new students, they interfere with the student's ability to benefit from an American education. What can parents do? o Parents can find out what is happening in the school by attending school events, routinely asking students about school activities, keeping a family calendar, and reviewing school newsletters and websites with help from translators. o Parents can call the Ac ademic Coach whenever a friendship does not seem appropriate. It is often difficult to determine by the appearance, or even by the behavior of another student, whether the friendship is a positive one. Parents should not hesitate to ask if they have any concerns. Academic Coaches and guidance counselors can monitor the situation, talk to the student, and perhaps steer the student in a more positive direction. o Parents should encourage students to join clubs and to sign up for after-school events and activities in local community organizations. Not only do the students have the c hance to meet new friends, but they can develop new skills and interests. o Parents of middle sch ool students should require that their children participate in at least one school club. High school students should have a least two activities (voluntee r, sports, clubs) in addition to their schoolwork. Parent Program 3 6 o Parents can encourage students to volunteer in local community organizations. Students who volunteer tend to concentrate more on helping others than on their own frustrations. As a result, they improve their self-esteem because they are helping others and are making a contribution, they acquire essential skills that are applicable beyond school, and they may find an interest that they never knew they had. For parents, a child who is volunteering is a child who is using time in a positive manner. Guidance counselors can connect students with appropriate volunteer opportunities. o Parents should research to determine where their children can go after school if no one is home. This is a problem for all parents, especially if adults in the family are employed. Encourage parents to talk to neighbors and other family members about sharing supervision, or to research community agencies that sponsor after-school programs. The refugee parents may not realize that teenagers need supervision after school, not only because they may be too young to stay home legally, but they also may need guidance so that they do not develop unhealthy relationship s and get involved in activities that are unsafe or illegal. o Instructors should review the char acteristics of a \"good friend\" so that the parents know what the students have been told. These qualities are discussed in the Refugee Academy Module 2: Making Friends . \u0083 Discuss the challenges of balanc ing school work, after-school activities, family activities, and friendships. Explain that the students will discuss in the Refugee Academy how to manage multiple activities and handle the stress of their new life in school. Many students will find that they are trying to handle too many things at once. \u0083 Parents should emphasize that school work should be top priority. Instructors should review the following concepts related to completing schoolwork that may be unf amiliar to refugee parents: o Time Management - Students will discuss time management in the Refugee Academy. Parents can hel p students set up a schedule that is realistic and allows for sch ool work to be completed on time. Stress the importance of punc tuality and meeting deadlines. o Tutors - Parents may be unaware that tuto ring is available. Explain how tutors can be contacted and if the school district will cover the expense. Parent Program 3 7o Public Library - Parents may not realize that the library is free to the public and that in addition to books and DVDs, most libraries have computers that can be used by the students and their family members. Explain how families can get library cards. o Internet Research - Demonstrate to parents how students can do research for school projects on the internet. Show websites that have pictures of topics that the students ar e studying, so that parents who cannot speak English can see what is available on the internet. Explain that computer security is discussed in the Refugee Academy, and encourage parents to monitor com puter use. They do not have to be able to speak English to see what is on a computer screen. o Parent-Teacher Conferences - Refugee parents may not realize that they can meet with teachers any time they have questions or concerns. They may not know that the school has scheduled parent-teacher conferences in t he elementary grades and that parents can call the school and make an appointment to meet with a teacher at any time during the school year. Explain to the parents how they can make an appointment with the teac her. Reassure them that teachers are oft en pleased that parents initiate parent-teacher conferences. o Open House - Most schools have an Open House at the beginning of the school year, when parent s can meet the teachers. Encourage parents to attend, even if they do not speak English. They will get a sense of the cla ssroom and school environment, the subjects that are covered, and the challenges that are presented to their children. They will also get to know who the teachers are so that they are more comfortable if they have to meet with them. o Guidance Counselors - Although the students will have their assigned Academic Coaches, the school guidance counselors are available for helping students wit h academic planning, problems with school work, and personal issues. Encourage parents to contact the guidance counselor if they are concerned about their child's mental health, stress levels, difficulties with relationships, or any other behaviors that need attention. Guidance counselors are trained to assist families and will find the necessary resources to help the students. They apprec iate it when parents call. Parent Program 3 8 o Coaches, Club Leaders, Community Activity Instructors - Any adult leading a group of students welcomes i nput from parents. Encourage parents to introduce them selves to coaches or any other activity instructor. Parent s can explain what the student is interested in, any past experience with the activity, and concerns that the parents or students may have. It may be necessary to include a translator in the discussion. \u0083 Talk to the parents about homework. Most of the parents will have already encountered homework and may be struggling with assisting their children with their schoolwork. The parents may not speak English and do not understand the assignments. They may not be sure what has been assigned, or they are unclear about what the students are expected to do. Of course, they may also be struggling with a typical comment of any student enrolled in an American school: I don't have any homework. For some families, bri nging up the topic of homework results in whining and tear s. Students are frustrated, and so are their parents. Listen to the parents talk about t heir experiences with homework. Reassure them that if they are having difficulty finding out what the assignments are, getting their childr en to do the homework, or helping their children, then they are not alone. Discuss the following: o Teachers usually post homework assignments on a blackboard or distribute a syllabus with assignments. Some teachers announce the homework at t he end of class. All students should carry an assignment notebook and should be expected to write down every assignment . This process is discussed in the Refugee Academy, and students are encou raged to purchase a small notebook and keep it with them at a ll times. They can record their assignments and then refer to it when it is time to work on homework. Parents should check the assignment notebook every night. If nothing is written it, they should call the classroom teacher(s) or the Academic Coach. o Share the key points in the attached article from the United States Department of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement on Helping Your Child With Homework. Do not copy and distribute the attached article. Highlight the ideas for helping students and discuss how parents can realistically implement the suggestions. For ex ample, the article suggests picking a specific place for the students to do their homework every night. Many students live in cram ped quarters with little privacy. Discuss with the parents the options for a quiet study place. Can they work at the kitchen table and get assistance from parents at the same time? Can they take advantage of a local library? Can the family institute \"homework time\" when the television is off and the family focuses on getting school work finished? Be practical, while stressing the importance of completing homework. Parent Program 3 9United States Department of Education Office of Educational Research and Improvement HELPING YOUR CHILD WITH HOMEWORK (Instructors should share the highlight s of this articl e with parents.) How To Help: Show You Think Education and Homework Are Important Children need to know that their parents and adults close to them think homework is important. If they know their parents care, children have a good reason to complete assignments and turn them in on time. There is a lot that you can do to show that you value education and homework. Set a Regular Time Finding a regular time for homework helps children finish assignments. The best schedule is one that works for your child and your family. What works well in one household may not work in another. Of course, a good schedule depends in part on your child's age, as well as individual needs. For instance, one youngster may work best in the afternoon after an hour of play, and another may be more efficient after dinner (although late at night, when children are tired, is seldom a good time). Outside activities, such as sports or music lessons, may mean that you need a flexible schedule. Your child may study after school on some days and in the evening on others. If there isn't enough time to finish homework, your child may need to drop some outside activity. Homework must be a high priority. You'll need to work with your elementary school child to develop a schedule. An older student can probably make up a schedule independently, although you'll want to make sure it's a good one. It may help to writ e out the schedule and put it in a place where you'll see it often, such as the refrigerator door. Some families have a required amount of time that children must devote to homework or some other learning activity each school night (the length of time can vary depending upon the child's age). For instance, if your seventh-grader knows she's expected to spend an hour doing homework, reading, or visiting the library, she may be less likely to rush through assignments so that she can watch television. A required amount of time may also discourage her from \"forgetting\" to bring home assignments and help her adjust to a routine. Pick a Place A study area should have lots of light, supplies close by, and be fairly quiet. A study area doesn't have to be fancy. A desk in the bedroom is nice, but for many youngsters the kitchen table or a corner of the living room works just fine. Your child may enj oy decorating a special study corner. A plant, a brightly colored container to hold pencils, and some favorite artwork taped to the walls can make study time more pleasant. Parent Program 3 10 Remove Distractions Turn off the television and discourage social telephone calls during homework time. (A call to a classmate about an assignment may, however, be helpful.) Some youngsters work well with quiet background music, but loud noise from the ster eo or radio is not OK. One Virginia junior high school history teacher lament s, \"I've actually had a kid turn in an assignment that had written in the middle, `And George Washington said, \"Ohhhhh, I love you.\"' The kid was so plugged into the music that he wasn't concentrating.\" If you live in a small or noisy household, try having all family members take part in a quiet activity during homework time. You may need to take a noisy toddler outside or into another room to play. If distractions can't be avoided, your child may want to complete assignments in a nearby library. Provide Supplies and Identify Resources For starters, collect pencils, pens, erasers, writing paper, an assignment book, and a dictionary. Other things that might be helpful include glue, a stapler, paper clips, maps, a calculator, a pencil sharpener, tape, scissors, a ruler, index cards, a thesaurus, and an almanac. Keep these items together in one place if possible. If you can't provide your child with needed supplies, check with the teacher, school guidance counselor, or principal about possible sources of assistance. For books and other information resources, check with the school library or local public library. Some libraries have homework centers designed especially to assist children with school assignments (there may even be tutors and other kinds of individual assistance). These days many schools have computers in classrooms, and many households have personal computers. However, you don't have to have a computer in your home in order for your child to complete homework assignments successfully. You may want to ask the teacher to explain school policy about the use of computers for homework. Certainly, computers can be a great learning tool and helpful for some assignments. They can be used for word processing and on-line reference resources, as well as educational programs and games to sharpen skills. Some schools may offer after-school programs where your child can use the school computers. And many public libraries make computers available to children. Set a Good Example Children are more likely to study if they see you reading, writing, and doing things that r equire thought and effort on your part. Talk with your child about what you're reading and writing even if it's something as simple as making the grocery list. Tell them about what you do at work. Encourage activities that support learning--for example, educational games, library visits, walks in the neighborhood, trips to the zoo or museums, and chores that teach a sense of responsibility. Parent Program 3 11Show an Interest Make time to take your child to the library to check out materials needed for homework (and for fun too), and read with your child as often as you can. Talk about school and learning activities in family conversations. Ask your child what was discussed in class that day. If he doesn't have much to say, try another approach. For example, ask your child to read aloud a story he wrot e or discuss the results of a science experiment. Another good way to show your interest is to attend school activities, such as parent-teacher meetings, shows, and sports events. If you can, volunteer to help in the classroom or at special events. Getting to know some classmates and other parents not only shows you're interested but helps build a network of support for you and your child. How To Help: Monitor Assignments Children are more likely to complete assignments successfully when parents monitor homework. How closely you need to monitor depends upon the age of your child, how independent she is, and how well she does in school. Whatever the age of your child, if assignments are not getting done satisfactorily, more supervision is needed. Here are some good ways to monitor assignments: Ask About the School's Homework Policy. At the start of t he school year, ask the teacher: \u0083 What kinds of assignments will be given? \u0083 How long are children expected to take to complete them? \u0083 How does the teacher want you to be involved? Teachers' expectations vary. Ask your child's teacher what you should do. Should you just check to make sure the assignment is done, or should you do something more? Some teachers want parents to go over the homework and point out errors, while others ask parents to simply check to make sure the assignment is completed. It's also a good idea to ask the teacher to call you if any problems with homework come up. Be Available. Elementary school students often like to have someone in the same room when working on assignments in case they have questions. If your child will be cared for by someone else, talk to that person about what you expect regarding homework. For an older child, if no one will be around, let him know you want him to begin work before you get home and call to remind him if necessary. Look Over Completed Assignments. It's usually a good idea to check to see that your elementary school child has finished her assignments. If your junior high school student is having trouble finishing assignments, check his Parent Program 3 12too. If you're not there when an assignment is finished, look it over when you get home. After the teacher returns completed homework, read the comments to see if your child has done the assignments satisfactorily. Monitor Television Viewing. American children on average spend far more time watching television than they do completing homework. In many homes, more homework gets done when television time is limited. Once you and your child have worked out a homework schedule, take time to discuss how much television and what programs she can watch. It's worth noting that television can be a learning tool. Look for programs that relate to what your child is studying in school, such as programs on history or science or dramatizations of children's literature. When you can, watch shows with your child, discuss them, and encourage follow-up activities such as reading or a trip to the museum. How To Help: Provide Guidance The basic rule is, \"Don't do the assignments yourself.\" It's not your homework--it's your child's. \"I've had kids hand in homework that's in their parents' handwriting,\" one Washington, DC-area eighth-grade teacher complains. Doing assignments for your child won't help him understand and use information. And it won't help him become confident in his own abilities. It can be hard for parents to let children work through problems alone and learn from their mistakes. It's also hard to know where to draw the line between supporting and doing. Different teachers have different ideas about the best way for parents to provide guidance. Here are a few suggestions with which most teachers agree: Figure Out How Your Child Learns Best. If you understand something about the style of learning that suits your child, it will be easier for you to help her. If you've never thought about this style, observe your child. See if he works better alone or with someone else. If your child gets more done when working with someone else, he may want to complete some assignments with a brother or sister or a classmate. (Some homework, however, is meant to be done alone. Check with the teacher if you aren't sure.) Other things to consider about learning style: Does your child learn things best when she can see them? If so, drawing a picture or a chart may help with some assignments. For example, after reading her science book, she may not remember the difference between the tibia and the fibula. But by drawing a picture of the leg and labeling the bones, she can remember easily. Parent Program 3 13Does your child learn things best when he can hear them? He may need to listen to a story or have directions read to him. Too much written material or too many pictures or charts may confuse him. Does your child understand some things best when she can handle or move them? An apple cut four or six or eight ways can help children learn fractions. Help Your Child Get Organized. As mentioned earlier, it's a good idea to set a regular time for children to do homework. Put up a calendar in a place where you'll see it often and record assignments on it. If your child's not able to write yet, then do it for him until he can do it himself. Writing out assignments will get him used to the idea of keeping track of what's due and when. You may want to use an assignment book instead of a calendar. A bag for books will make it easier to carry homework to and from school. Homework folders in which youngsters can tuck their assignments for safekeeping help many students stay organized. Encourage Good Study Habits. Teachers generally give students tips on how to study. But it takes time and practice to develop good habits. You can reinforce these habits at home. For example: Help your child structure time in order to complete assignments. For example, if your eighth-grader has a biology report due in 3 weeks, discuss all the steps she needs to take to complete it on time, including: \u0083 selecting a topic; \u0083 doing the research by looking up books and other \u0083 materials on the topic and taking notes; \u0083 figuring out what questions to discuss; \u0083 drafting an outline; \u0083 writing a rough draft; and \u0083 revising and completing the final draft. Encourage your child to write down how much time she expects to spend on each step. Help your child get started when he has to do research reports or other big assignments. Encourage him to use the library. If he isn't sure where to begin, have him ask the librarian for suggestions. If he's using a computer for on-line reference resources--whether the computer's at home, school, or the library--make sure he's getting whatever help he needs to use it properly. As mentioned earlier, many public libraries have homework centers where there are tutors or other kinds of one-on-one assistance. After your child has done the research, listen while he tells you the points he wants to make in the report. Give practice tests. Help your third-grader prepare for a spelling test by saying the words while she writes them down. Then have her correct her own test. Help your child avoid last-minute cramming. Review with your fifth-grader how to study for his social Parent Program 3 14studies test well before it's to be given. You can have him work out a schedule of what he needs to do to, make up a practice test, and write down answers to the questions he's made up. Talk with your child about how to take a test. Be sure she understands how important it is to read the instructions carefully and to keep track of the time and avoid spending too much time on any one question. Several books and pamphlets listed in the Resources section of this book give more tips on how your child can get organized and develop good study habits. Talk About the Assignments. Ask your child questions. Talking can help him think through an assignment and break it down into small, workable parts. Here are some sample questions: Do you understand what you're supposed to do? After your child has read the instructions, ask her to tell you in her own words what the assignment is about. (If your child can't read yet, the teacher may have sent home instructions that you can read to her.) Some schools have homework hotlines you can call for assignments in case your child misplaced a paper or was absent that day. If your child doesn't understand the instructions, read them with her and talk about the assignment. Are there words she doesn't understand? How can she find out what they mean? If neither you nor your child understands an assignment, call a classmate or contact the teacher. What do you need to do to finish the assignment? Your child may want to talk through the steps with you (or make a written list of them, if he's able to), as described in the section above on good study habits. Do you need help in understanding how to do your work? See if your child needs to learn more, for example, about subtracting fractions before she can do her assignment. Or find out if t he teacher needs to explain to her again when to use capital and lowercase letters. If you understand the subject yourself, you may want to work through some examples with your child. But let her do the assignment herself. Have you ever done any problems like the ones you're supposed to do right now? See if your child has already done similar problems that can guide him in completing these particular ones. Do you have everything you need to do the assignment? Sometimes your child needs special supplies, such as colored pencils, metric rulers, maps, or reference books. As mentioned before, check with the teacher, school guidance counselor, or principal for possible sources of assistance if you can't provide needed supplies; and check with the local public library or school library for books and other information resources. Does your answer make sense to you? Sometimes the response to a math problem doesn't seem logical, or the meaning of a paragraph your child has written is unclear. If that's the case, your child may need to check over the math problem or revise the paragraph. Parent Program 3 15If your child is still confused, ask: \u0083 How far have you gotten on the assignment? Let's try to figure out where you're having a problem. \u0083 Do you need to review your notes (or reread a chapter in your textbook) before you do the assignment? \u0083 Are you still having problems? Maybe it would help to take a break or have a snack. Give Praise. People of all ages respond to praise. And children need encouragement from the people whose opinions they value most--their parents. \"Good first draft of your book report!\" or \"You've done a great job\" can go a long way toward motivating your child to complete assignments. Children also need to know when they haven't done their best work. Make criticism constructive. Instead of telling a third-grader, \"You aren't going to hand in that mess, are you?\" try, \"The teacher will understand your ideas better if you use your best handwriting.\" Then give praise when a neat version is completed. How To Help: Talk With Someone at School To Resolve Problems Homework hassles can often be avoided when parents and caregivers value, monitor, and guide their children's work on assignments. But, sometimes helping in these ways is not enough. Problems can still come up. If they do, the schools, teachers, parent s, and students may need to work together to resolve them. Share Concerns With the Teacher. You may want to contact the teacher if: \u0083 your child refuses to do her assignments, even though you've tried hard to get her to do them; \u0083 instructions are unclear; \u0083 you can't seem to help your child get organized to finish the assignments; \u0083 you can't provide needed supplies or materials; \u0083 neither you nor your child can understand the purpose of assignments; \u0083 the assignments are often too hard or too easy; \u0083 the homework is assigned in uneven amounts--for instance, no homework is given on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, but on Thursday four of your child's teachers all make big assignments that are due the next day; or \u0083 your child has missed school and needs to make up assignments. In some cases, the school guidance counselor may be helpful in resolving such problems. Work With the School. Communication between teachers and parents is very important in solving homework problems. Here are some important things to remember: Talk with teachers early in the school year. Get acquainted before problems arise, and let teachers Parent Program 3 16know that you want to be kept informed. Most elementary schools and many secondary schools invite parents to come to parent-teacher conferences or open houses. If your child's school doesn't provide such opportunities, call the teacher to set up a meeting. Contact the teacher as soon as you suspect your child has a homework problem (as well as when you think he's having any major problems with his schoolwork). Schools have a responsibility to keep parents informed, and you have a right to be upset if you don't find out until report-card time that your child is having difficulties. On the other hand, sometimes parents figure out that a problem exists before the teacher does. By alerting the teacher, you can work together to solve a problem in its early stages. Request a meeting with the teacher to discuss homework problems. Tell him briefly why you want to meet. You might say, \"Rachel is having trouble with her math homework. I'm worried about why she can't finish the problems and what we might do to help her.\" Parents for whom English is a second language may need to make special arrangements, such as including another person who is bilingual. Don't go straight to the principal without giving the teacher a chance to work out the problem with you and your child. Approach the teacher with a cooperative spirit. Believe that the teacher wants to help you and your child, even if you disagree about something. It's hard to solve problems if teachers and parents view each other as enemies. If you have a complaint, try not to put the teacher on the defensive. For example, avoid sayi ng that you think the assignments are terrible even if you think so. You might say, \"I'm glad Calvin is learning to add and subtract in the first grade, but he doesn't want to do his math work sheets. Can we find another way for him to learn the same material?\" This might encourage the teacher to let Calvin (and the rest of his classmates) try another approach. Perhaps he can learn addition and subtraction by moving around buttons, sticks, or shells. Let the teacher know if your child is bored with assignments or finds them too hard or too easy. (Teachers also like to know when children are particularly excited about an assignment.) Of course, not all homework assignments can be expected to interest your child and be perfectly suited to her. Teachers just don't have time to tailor homework to the individual needs of each student night after night. However, most teachers want to assign homework that children enjoy and can complete successfully, and they welcome feedback from parents. Many times homework can be structured so that a wide range of children will find assignments interesting. For example: \u0083 Different approaches to the same topic or lesson can be offered to students; \u0083 Extra assignments can be given to students who want more challenge; and Parent Program 3 17\u0083 Specialized assignments can be given to students having trouble in a particular area. While meeting with the teacher, explain what you think is going on. Also tell the teacher if you don't know what the problem is. Sometimes a child's version of what's going on isn't the same as the teacher's version. For example, your child may tell you that the teacher never explains assignments so he can understand them. But the teacher may tell you that your child isn't paying attention when assignments are given. Work out a way to solve or lessen the problem. The strategy will depend on what the problem is, how severe it is, and the needs of your child. For instance: \u0083 Is the homework often too hard? Maybe your child has fallen behind and will need extra help from a teacher, parent, or tutor to catch up. \u0083 Does your child need to make up a lot of work because of absences? The first step might be working out a schedule with the teacher. \u0083 Has your child been diagnosed with a learning disability or is one suspected? If so, you'll need to make sure your child gets extra help, and the teacher may need to adjust some assignments. (See Federal Sources of Assistance in the Resources Section of this book.) Does your child need extra support, beyond what home and school can give? Ask the teacher, school guidance counselor, or principal if there are mentor programs in your community. Mentor programs pair a child with an adult volunteer who assists with the youngster's special needs, such as tutoring or career advice. There are many good mentor programs operating in schools, universities, community organizations, churches, and businesses. Make sure communication is clear. Listen to the teacher and don't leave until you're sure you understand what's being said. Make sure, too, that the teacher understands what you have to say. If, after the meeting, you realize you don't understand something, call the teacher to double check. It may help to summarize what you've agreed to do at the end of the meeting: OK, so to keep track of Kim's assignments, I'll check her assignment book each night and write my initials by new assignments. Each day you'll check to make sure she's written down all new assignments in her book. That way we'll be certain that I know what her assignments are. Follow up to make sure that the approach you agreed to is working. If the teacher told you, for example, that your child needs to spend more time practicing long division, check back in a month to talk about your child's progress. Homework can bring together children, parents, and teachers in a common effort to improve student learning. The younger your child is Parent Program 3 18when you start to do the kinds of activities suggested in this guide, the better. Helping your child with homework is an opportunity to improve your child's chances of doing well in school and life. By helping your child with homework, you can help him learn important lessons about discipline and responsibility. You can open up lines of communication--between you and your child, and you and the school. You are in a unique position to help your child make connections between school work and the \"real world,\" and thereby bring meaning (and some fun) to your child's homework experience. Whether you succeed in doing all of the activities suggested in this guide is not what's most important. What's most important is that you are willing to take the time and make the effort to be involved in your child's education. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 1 Welcome to Our Schools Parent Program 4: Lead Poisoning PURPOSE The purpose of the Parent Program 4: Lead Poisoning is to raise the awareness of parents and family members about the dangers of lead poisoning so that they can implement prevention and intervention strategies. OBJECTIVES The objectives of Parent Progr am 4 are to inform parents about: \u0083 Sources of lead poisoning \u0083 Impact of lead poisoning on physical health \u0083 Impact of lead poisoning on mental and behavioral health \u0083 Symptoms of lead poisoning \u0083 Assessing for potential sources of lead \u0083 Preventing lead poisoning \u0083 How to inform children and family members about lead poisoning prevention \u0083 Resources to assist in prevent ing and eliminating lead poisoning Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 2 FORMAT The information on lead poisoning can be presented either as a full Parent Program dedicated to lead poisoning, or as a component of a general Parent Program about refugee student s and American schools. Instructors of the Pare nt Program are not expected to be experts on lead poisoning. If they do not know the answers to questions or are approached by parents who need assistance, then the inst ructors should refer the parents to the Academic Coaches, the school nurse, or the Refugee Resettlement Case Manager. (Academic Coaches should foll ow up on parent concerns with the Refugee Resettlement Case Manager.) If further information is required, the Ac ademic Coaches should either follow up on parent concerns by contacting the appropriate experts or by referring the parents to local resources. Instructors can also co-pre sent with health teachers, physicians or school nurses, county and local health care providers and clinic representatives, or lead poisoning specialists. The degree of detail provided in the pr ogram will be dependent on the severity of the problem in the community, and the amount of time available with parent groups. The activities selected can be im plemented in any order, and should be selected on the basis of: \u0083 The comfort level of the parents and their familiarity with the Refugee Academy staff and other presenters \u0083 The needs and concerns of the parents \u0083 The awareness of Refugee Acad emy students about lead poisoning and their ability to discuss the information with their parents and family members \u0083 The number of languages that need to be translated during the Parent Program \u0083 The number of parents attending the Parent Program, and their connections with each other \u0083 Past history of the re fugee parents and their trust of health care workers, teachers and school administrators, and government employees The presenters should keep in mind that the background of the participants may range from considerable experience with formal education programs to no experience at all. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 3The instructor can determine the pace of the Parent Program , recognizing that modification of the agenda may have to be made as the program progresses. They should allow significant time for questions. It is important to recognize that the in formation provided in the Parent Program on lead poisoning can be overwh elming and confusing to parents, especially if they are trying to learn new terminology , listen to the translator, and understand what the instructors are explaining. Teachers of English as a Second Language and translators will be critical par ticipants in the presentations. Parents should know that the Academic Coaches will review information about lead poisoning with the student s in the Refugee Academy. Instructors should repeatedly reassure parents that if they have any questions or concerns, they can talk to an Academ ic Coach who will contact the Refugee Resettlement Case Manager.

The health effects of lead poisoning on children can be devastating, especially because the impact of lead may be invisible. Lead poisoning is one of the most comm on and preventable childhood health problems in the United States. Lead is a heavy metal that does not break down and decompose, so it has been used in m any products such as water pipes, pewter dishes, paint, and other commercia l products. Once it was confirmed in the early 1960s that lead could also be a poi son, including the dust of lead paint, actions were taken to eliminate the us e of lead and to implement screening for lead in infants and children. Lead is a poison that affects almost every system in the body. Shortly after lead enters the body through ingestion, hands in the mouth, or inhal ation of dust, the lead travels in the blood to the soft tiss ues such as the liver, kidneys, and brain. The body gradually moves lead from t he blood and organs to the bones and teeth, where it can be stored for decades. Any amount of lead in the body is considered toxic. Children under the age of 6 are at the greatest risk of health effects associated with exposure to lead. They are particula rly vulnerable because their brain and central nervous system are still forming. Lead interferes with the development of these systems as well as the kidney and blood-forming organs. In addition, lead can cross the placenta and adversely affect a developing fetus. Lead poisoning is not always visible, and the vast majority of children exposed to lead go undiagnosed and untreat ed. The effects of lead may occur with no overt outward symptoms, and cognitive damage is not apparent until children reach age 4 or later. The behavioral effects of lead are irreversible and may not be noticed until the child enters school. Health effects vary from child to child, but examples of the toxic nature of lead are: \u0083 Decrease in IQ points from even very small exposure to lead \u0083 Learning disabilities \u0083 Behavioral problems \u0083 Hyperactivity \u0083 Lethargy \u0083 Stunted or slowed growth \u0083 Impaired hearing \u0083 Difficulty concentrating / attention deficits \u0083 Wrist or foot drop Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 5\u0083 Seizures \u0083 Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea \u0083 Encephalopathy (brain dysfunction) \u0083 Nausea, constipation, colic, dyspepsia \u0083 damage \u0083 Hypertension \u0083 Deficits in visual-spatial skills , fine motor coordination, balance \u0083 Coma These effects can get worse if nothing is done to eliminate the lead exposure problem. At increasingly higher levels of exposure, the health effects can be kidney damage, significant IQ deficits, and developmental disabilities such as mental retardation. Children and adults can fall into a coma or die from lead poisoning. The symptoms of lead poisoning can be s ubtle and they are often confused with other problems in learning, behavior, or health issues. For example, a child may have a stomachache or headache, loss of appetite, irritability, or hyperactivity. The child may be inattentive or confused, or demonstrate lack of initiative or enthusiasm for school activities. All of these behaviors can be misinterpr eted as discomfort with school, adjusting to a new school environment, language difficu lties, and other factors that would naturally occur when a refugee child is adapting to an American school. But since the symptoms of lead poisoning ar e not always visible as health issues, parents may not understand how lead poisoning can affect the behavior of children. Parents may be comfortable with the behav ior of their children because their child has always behaved that way, or because the parents are unfamiliar with behavior that is expected in an American classroom. For example, if a child is particularly let hargic or unable to pay attention in class, the parents may attribute the behavior to adjusting to a new sc hool (or adjusting to formal education) and the demands of life in the new country. Parents may also indicate that the child has always behaved that way. The instructor should explain that l ead poisoning may be a possible explanation for behaviors in school that affect academ ic progress and social interactions. The instructor should consistently emphasize the importance of testi ng so that actions can be taken to assist the child in improving health and behavior. Instructors should keep in mind that some parents may be sensitive (or defensive) when it becomes clear that their children are not able to keep up in school because they have been exposed to lead. Instructors should stress that Academic Coaches can provide informati on and support should the parents have any concerns. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 6 2. Lead is a natural element that had thousands of uses, but it is also a powerful neurotoxin that interferes with the development of the brain and nervous system. Lead poisoning is not limited to the United States, although industrialization was a major contributor to the use of lead in public facilities, manufacturing plants, and homes. Lead poisoning is a worldwide problem, particularly in countries where there are no regulatio ns about the use of lead. It is a myth that the problem of lead poi soning is limited to Africa. This myth generated from the death of a Sudanese re fugee child in the year 2000. Lead poisoning can be found in both developing c ountries and in highly industrialized countries anywhere in the world. Refugee children are twice as likely as U.S. children to have elevated lead levels in their blood. Some are exposed to lead prior to arriving in the United States, while others are exposed once they are resettled. In developing countries, several factors increase the potential for lead exposure: \u0083 environmental pollution \u0083 absent or lax environ mental regulations \u0083 hot climates that allow for outdoor liv ing and activities (on ground that may contain lead) \u0083 open housing construction, often with lead-painted materials \u0083 concentration of populations around heavy traffic areas. Refugee children may have a compromised i mmune or nutritional status that can cause an increase in vulnerability to lead poisoning. Malnutrition and anemia can enhance lead absorption. Child ren who mouth or eat non- food items, especially soil, can become exposed to lead. Leaded gas, leaded solder, and lead paint have been banned in the United States, but the remnants still remain across the coun Smelters, chemical and battery pl ants, burning of fossil fuels and solid waste, ammunition manufacturi ng and use, and traditional use of home remedies that contain l ead have all contributed to lead in the environment. try. d t. cities. There are at least 38 million hom es and buildings in the Unite States that contain lead paint, some of it peeling and covering the area with dus Leaded gasoline is still in the soil around roads and storage areas. Thousands of lead pipes continue to serve as water serv ice lines in many older United States Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 7 The most common risk hazard is living in an older home (built before 1975), especially those homes that were built before 1950 and are in disrepair. Many refugee families are resettled in older housing because of the affordability and availability. Peeling and chipping paint on the housing exterior and on walls, banisters, windowsills, and radiators often contain lead. The lead paint starts to c and peel and gets grounded into dust. The tiny pieces of lead can gather in areas that are not often cleaned, such as corners of windows, bet ween floorboards, and under radiators. The lead dust can become part of the dust in the house and in the soil around the house. hip Lead hazards have been found in playgrounds, primarily due to the age of paint on the playground equipment. School district s are responsible for determining the age and condition of the paint, and should be alert to deteriorating paint. Some dishes and ceramic ware contain lead, even though since 1980 the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has had limits on lead and cadmium in ceramic ware products. However suspect ceramic ware products can enter the United States, especially if they are brought in personal baggage. A glaze or decoration may have high levels of lead that can get into food, wear off on hands, and leave lead dust. Lead can be found in the following pr oducts, depending upon the year and the source of production: \u0083 Drinking water (from lead pipes) \u0083 Hair dyes \u0083 Miniblinds \u0083 Calcium and other vitamin \u0083 products \u0083 Playground equipment \u0083 Necklaces \u0083 Toys \u0083 Dishes and lead crystal \u0083 Eye makeup, lipstick, kohl \u0083 Imported wine containers with lead foil wrappers \u0083 Folk remedies such as \"pay-loo- ah\" - a red and orange powder used for fever (Asian origin) \u0083 Imported soldered ca ns containing food Lead exposure can also occur in various occupations and hobbies: \u0083 Hobbies such as glazed pottery making, stained glasswork, home remodeling, lead soldering, preparation of home remedies Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 8 \u0083 Employment such as auto repair, we lding, bridge reconstruction, painting and remodeling, cable splicing, and foundr y work may result in lead dust on clothing and car seats if par ents wear uniforms home. \u0083 Lead dust from paint can get on household surfaces, floors, toys, blankets and linens, and even pets. Children tend to spend more time on the floor where lead dust may be present. 3. The first step in eliminating lead poisoning is testing for lead. The first step to determining if there is a problem to address is screening children and adults for lead. The second step is to assess the environment of the refugee families, including their homes, playgrounds , recreational facilities, religious centers, and other gathering places. \u0083 Lead Screening o Federal standards currently st ipulate that a refugee medical screening must take place within 90 days after a refugee's arrival (or status granted) in the United States - for children less than 7 at the time of arrival or status granted. o The contents of the screening vary from state to state, and many states do not specify a blood lead level (BLL) screening for refugee children. o In New York State, refugee children under 7 should have been tested for lead. o The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend testing for children who have emigrated from other c ountries where lead poisoning is present. Recently local and state health organizations have encouraged BLL screening for adults who are refugees, as well as for all refugee families who may have settled in housing in the United States that may c ontain lead paint or pipes. When discussing prevention and intervention, instru ctors of the Refugee Academy and Parent Program s will have to explain the process of testing for lead. Screeni ng children for exposure to lead is done by a finger-stick (or capillary) method. Further testing may be necessary. For many refugees, the process of being examined and giving blood may be embarrassing or even fright ening. Instructors can explain to Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 9parents that it is simple, quick test that is vital for determining lead levels in the body. Parents should also be reassured that there are treatments and medications available for treating elevated lead levels. In some cases, the damage caused by exposure to lead may be irreversible, especially if lead poisoning has caused br ain or neurological damage. It is important that families understand the importance of the testing so that intervention can start imm ediately, if necessary. Once lead exposure is suspected, further medical evaluation of health history, environment (past and current), family activities and traditions, mother's habits when pregnant, food and fo lk medicines, and other factors associated with lead exposure need to be assessed. This should be done by a physician in conjunction with lead poisoning speciali sts from a local health department. A repeat blood test should be performed three to six months after refugee children are placed in a residence, to determine if BLLs have been reduced or elevated. Resettlement in housing in the United States may have contributed to higher BLLs that did not exist when the child first arrived. Blood levels can rise quick ly, signaling sudden exposure to lead. If parents are not sure if their child ren were tested, or if they have concerns about the testing process or results for any family members, they should talk to their Academic Coach, who will contact the Refugee Resettlement Case Manager. \u0083 Environmental Assessment o An environmental assessment s hould be done by a specialist in lead poisoning, but it may not be possible to assess housing before a family is resettled. Refugee families may want to do their own immediate assessment after parti cipating in the Refugee Academy Parent Program. o A visual assessment, from floor to ceiling, can be done by walking around the exterior and interior of a building, looking under radiators, on windowsills, in cor ners, and in other places such as steps, porches, railings, gutters, spout s, doors, roof tiles, or cellar entries, that may not be immediately noticeable. o The instructor should remind parents to assess all of the places that their children visit, including child care centers or the homes of babysitters; playgrounds; recreati on centers; and the homes of friends and relatives. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 10 4. Parents can make immediate changes to prevent lead poisoning and intervene if they are concerned. Parents can reduce the impact of lead exposure to reduce the amount of lead that might get absorbed or retained by the child. \u0083 Cleaning the environment o It is difficult to simply relocate refugee families to lead-free housing, especially because alter native housing may not be available. At the same time, extensive on-site removal of lead paint can raise the concentration of dust in the home. Parents will need advice from the heal th department, housing agencies, and other experts about how to clean up their home environment Parents can scrape and repaint, as long as they receive instructions on how to do the repairs without further exposure to lead. Remind parents that lead dust can be created during the paint removal process. o If the property owner is not abl e to provide a certificate of compliance that the property is lead safe, then the refugee families need to know who to contact for assistance. The Refugee Resettlement Case Manager can provide information about: \u0083 Who can inspect the property for lead \u0083 What is expected of the families before and after a lead inspection \u0083 How the property owner/landlor d will be contacted and what will happen as a result of contacting the property owner \u0083 What steps the property owner must take to alleviate any problems with lead \u0083 What will happen to the family if the property is determined to be \"high risk\" or in need of immediate painting and repair o Parents should frequently wash a ll toys, pacifiers, bottles, and other items handled by the children in the family. o Parents should wet wash floors and other surfaces. Vacuum cleaners can simply spread the dust. o If a parent or family member works in an environment where there might be lead dust (such as a factor y or in a home that is being Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 11remodeled) then they should asse ss their exposure to lead and take precautions. All work cl othing should be removed before entering the home, and clothes should be washed separately. o Parents can run tap water for a mi nute before drinking or cooking with it. If the water has been tested hi gh in lead, install an effective filtering device. Although it is ex pensive, families may need to switch to bottled water. o Families should not eat canned goods from countries outside of the United States. The ban on lead-solder ed cans is not worldwide. o Parents should discard any dishes and ceramic ware in their homes that are chipped or cracked. This may mean that refugee families have to throw out personal items t hat are meaningful to them, but they must realize that even handling the item c an contribute to lead poisoning. o They should not store food in any di shes that might contain lead, or store food in any antiques or colle ctibles. Any highly decorated or metallic-coated tableware, parti cularly items made in other countries, should never be used for food or liquids. o Ordinary glassware does not contain lead, but lead is still used to make expensive lead crystal. Fa milies should take the same precautions with crystal. Manufactu rers are the best source of information about the contents of eating and cooking utensils. \u0083 Advising children o Children should be encouraged to wash their hands and keep their hands out of their mouths for general good health and hygiene. o Instructors should keep stressing that children should wash their hands often, regardless of whether they have been exposed to lead or not. o Parents may need to be reminded that infants and children naturally put things in their mouths and should not be punished when they do. Children are curious and reach for things in areas that may not be routinely clean ed, like corners and under windows and radiators. The environment should be safe and clean. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 12 \u0083 Promoting good nutrition o Instructors can refer to Module 6: Stay Healthy for additional information about nutrition and for handouts that can be distributed to parents. o Good nutrition can reduce the amount of lead absorbed in the body. Nutrients slow absorption. o Children under age 6 will generally absorb/retain about 50% of the lead that they ingest, but that percentage can be slowed with good nutrition. The consumption of fatty foods should be kept to a minimum (but not eliminated, es pecially for children under age 2), and children should be receiving adequat e levels of calcium, iron, vitamin C, and zinc. o A daily vitamin should be par t of a healthy routine at home. o The instructors should provide general information about good nutrition. For exampl e, a diet deficient in iron and calcium may enhance the amount of lead absorbed. Some of the healthy staples may not be foods that are found in the homes of refugee familie s because they are not part of the traditional diet. Milk, yogurt, cheese, and green leafy vegetables (spinach, kale, collard greens) are good sources of calcium. o An iron-rich diet will help to reduce the amount of lead in red blood cells. Good sources of iron include red meats, fish, and chicken; iron-fortified cereals; and dried fruits such as raisins and prunes. o Iron is also better absorbed when foods and juices with vitamin C are part of a daily diet. Fruits, vegetables, and juice, particularly oranges, tomatoes, and green peppers, are excellent sources of vitamin C. 5. Parents may be sensitive about the topic of lead poisoning. There is no safe level of lead in the body, and it is crucial that refugee parents understand the significance of preventi ng and eliminating lead in their new environment. However, the subject of lead pois oning can be uncomfortable for parents. Instructors should be aware t hat the topic is not just scientific, but very personal, and parents may be sensitive when discussing the topic. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 13 \u0083 Be sensitive when discussing the safety and cleanliness of home environments Even if refugee families strive to k eep an immaculate home, they may be living in conditions that are difficult to keep clean. Old paint, fixtures, and appliances may come with an apartment or house. Parents may become defensive about their ability to keep a clean, lead-free home. At the same time, some refugee fam ilies have difficulty adjusting to new standards of cleanliness and sanitation. They may try to replicate a former way of life, which may include eati ng on the floor, living with animals, and cooking and eating foods in material s that contain lead. They may have difficulty understanding why they should give up their traditions and familiar way of life. Refugee families may also feel helpless in trying to change the conditions of their homes. Housing may require r epairs that are difficult to obtain. Refugees may be afraid to request, let alone demand, repairs such as painting over lead paint, lead pipe replacement, new kitchen counters, and an up-to-date refri gerator and stove. \u0083 Be sensitive when discussing parenting skills Once information is shared about l ead poisoning, parents may feel frightened or guilty that they have allowed their children to be exposed to lead. They may feel that the instruct or is implying that they were not parenting properly, and the f ault is with the parents. It is very important to approach the t opic as an environmental issue that is being addressed across the country, and that parents are being informed so that they can take action. Instruct ors should stress that most parents in the United States are just as unfamiliar with the sources and impact of lead poisoning, and every effort is being made to educate the public. Some refugee children were exposed to lead in their native countries. The ground may have contained the remnants of leaded gasoline, the cooking and eating utensils may have contained lead, and the housing, including housing in refugee camps, ma y have contained lead paint. Some refugee parents, struggling to su rvive conditions in their countries and keep their families together, depend ed on agencies to monitor their health as best they could. Unsani tary conditions, sick children, and primitive conditions may have been the norm, so the symptoms of lead poisoning were actually consider ed to be the outcome of unhealthy circumstances. Should parents become defensive or embarrassed (or angry), reassure them that the problem affects ma ny families and the instructor has Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 14immediate strategies that can be im plemented. Emphasize that the first strategy is to test children so that parents can know wh at steps to take next. \u0083 Be sensitive when discussing personal habits and hygiene When discussing lead poisoning, t he instructor will be highlighting personal habits that are unsafe. For example, the instru ctor will point out the use of cooking utensils, toys, makeup, deodorant, and any other items that contain dangerou s amounts of lead. The instructor will be stressing the impor tance of a well-balanced diet and sanitary eating habits, and will be di scussing hygiene practices like hand- washing and bathing. All of these subjects will call into question the personal habits of refugee families. For some parents, it may feel as if their traditions are being criticized. Refugee parents may have different perceptions of what is considered \"good hygiene\" and may be sensitive about their personal choices. Emphasis should always be on the value of washing to prevent lead poisoning. It is important that the in structor share information about prevention of lead poisoning after establishing a comfortable relation ship with the parents, and after explaining that they are providing in formation to protect health and safety. Instructors should provide a number of examples from a variety of cultures, not just refugee groups. Expl ain that changes in behaviors are difficult and a matter of personal choice, but parents should be aware of the dangers of lead. Most important, instructors s hould offer examples of safe alternatives. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 15ACTIVITIES PARENT PROGRAM 4 In this Parent Program there are 3 activities that should be completed: 1. In this activity, parents will receive general information about lead poisoning, with suggestions on how to take immediate action. Explain to the parents that they will be gi ven information about a health issue that concerns all parents in the United States, not just refugee parents. The health issue concerns a product called \"lead\" that has been used in paint, toys, cooking utensils, and other objects that families are exposed to every day. Explain that refugee families are being informed about lead because the instructors and Academic Coaches of the Refugee Ac ademy are concerned that refugee children may have been exposed to lead, which is poisonous. Using the Lead Poisoning Information Phot o Series, show the photographs one at a time, reading aloud the script at t he end of this Parent Program. The photos follow the script on page 36 and can be displayed or copied and shared. Read the information slowly and make sure t hat all of the parents can see the photos clearly. Although it is important to complete the photo series so that the parents are fully informed, pause to take questions. Instructors are not expected to be experts on lead poisoning and should explain that specific questions can be directed to t he Refugee Resettlement Case Manager. The instructor and Academic Coaches can also write down the questions and explain that they will take the questions to the Case Manager. For example, the parents may want to k now about specific products. They may be concerned about the toys their children are pl aying with and will not have the English language skills to be able to look up the toys on the website address provided in the Supplies section of this module. The instructor should keep reassuring paren ts that the Refugee Resettlement Case Manager will help them with resources and referrals. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 16 2. Distribute the following handouts and explain to the parents how they can use the handouts to remind themsel ves of the next steps to take. They can also use the handouts to share information with neighbors, family members, and friends.

The number corresponds to the picture to be displayed. Instructor: \u0088 I am going to show you some pictures wh ile I tell you about something that is important to know. \u0088 Watch and listen carefully so that you can learn how to take care of your family's health. \u0088 I am going to be talking about something called lead poisoning. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Lead is a metal that has been used in many products: Such as paint and pipes that bring water to your home Dishes Toys Some types of makeup And some types of jewelry. It was also used in gasoline and factories around the world. PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 8 Several years after lead was used in many different products, it was discovered that lead is a poison that can affect all parts of the body. Not everything contains lead, but there are still many products that have lead in them. Laws have been passed to stop the use of lead in products. Doctors and nurses test childre n and adults to see if they have been exposed to lead and have it in their bodies. 9 Your children were tested for lead when they came to this country, and will be tested again in a few months. You may remember that the doctor or nurse took a blood sample when you first arrived. It was done with a simple finger prick test. The children are tested because they may have been exposed to lead in your native country (name the countries of the parents) or after they arrived in the United States. 10 If children have lead in their system, then doctors can tell parents what to do. 11 There are medications and treat ments that can flush the poisonous lead from their bodies. 12 How can people get exposed to lead? How does it get in their bodies? The most common source of lead is paint. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 28 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 13 When paint with lead in it gets old it can chip and peel and crumble into dust. 14 The pieces of paint and paint dust can get on the furniture 15 on the floor where children play - 16 on the dishes and in the food when the dust is in the air 17 and hidden in corners and under heating systems like radiators. 18 Children are often crawling and playing on the floor. They chew on rattles, toys, blankets, and other objects 19 like stuffed animals. 20 They tend to put their hands in their mouths. That is how the lead from the paint chips and dust gets into their bodies. Any amount of lead in the body is too much and can be poisonous. What can happen? 21 Children can get sick. They can get stomach aches and headaches. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 29 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 22 They may have trouble with their balance and coordination. 23 Sometimes they have problems in school. They can't pay attention 24 They might be very tired or have trouble concentrating. Children with lead poisoning may have difficulty learning. They may fall way behind in school. 25 School is hard for them. There could be many reasons for this. Your child may need more time to learn new things. Your child could be tired from going to school. There are going to be times when they have a stomach ache and don't feel well enough to go to school. If you are concerned about your child's health Or behavior in school Talk to the Academic Coach. Your Academic Coach can help you figure out how to help your child. One thing your Academic Coach can do is help you to arrange to have your ch ild tested for lead poisoning. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 30 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 26 You as parents can do things to protect your children from lead poisoning. The first thing you need to do is inspect your home. Take a good look around. Do you see chipped and peeling paint? 27 You will need to look at both the inside and outside of your home. 28 Look in attics, cupboards , and in the corners. If you think that you have lead in your home, talk to your Academic Coach or Refugee Re settlement Case Manager. 29 Your Academic Coach or Case Manager will find out how to get your home cleaned and painted if there is lead in it. If you are not sure if th ere is lead, your Refugee Resettlement Case Manager can tell you how you can get your home inspected by someone who is an expert in lead poisoning. The expert will be there to help you and give you advise. It is not your fault if you have lead in the paint in your house. It should be fixed so your fa mily is safe and healthy. There are experts who know exac tly how to fix it for you. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 31 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 30 What else can you do to prevent lead poisoning? Remember that lead is not in everything. But it's a good idea to teach children to wash their hands And keep their hands out of your mouth. Little babies and young ones will naturally put things in their mouths. So make sure that they are not chewing on things that have been exposed to lead dust. Make sure that they are not pl aying on a floor that has lead dust. 31 Keep floors and surfaces clean 32 including the window blinds. Dust can settle on window shades and window wills Use a wet mop for the floor instead of a broom. Ask your children to help. Everyone should help to keep the house clean! 33 A very important thing you can do is feed your family a healthy diet. If your children eat good foods there is less damage from lead poisoning. 34 Feed your family lots of fruits Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 32 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 35 and vegetables. 36 Serve milk, cheese, yogurt, and eggs. 37 Serve raisins for snacks 38 Or cereal with fruit. 39 Include protein in the diet like fish 40 or beef and chicken 41 What else can you do? Make sure that you do not serve food on cracked or chipped dishes 42 Especially if they have shiny colored paint on them. They may have been made with clay or paint that contains lead. 43 You can also make sure that your children take a vitamin pill every day. Choose a vitamin that is for children. Ask a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist for help in choosing a vitamin. Your Academic Coach can tell you who to talk to about choosing the right vitamins for your children. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 33 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 44 If you spend time working on ca rs, you might be exposed to lead. This man should be wearing work gloves if possible. Wash your hands often. After you work on the car, or if you work in a factory or very old building, you may have lead dust on your clothes. 45 If you do home repair, you may have dust on your clothes. Do not wear clothes into the house that could have lead dust on them. Wash your clothes separately from everyone else's clothes. 46 You can also make sure that you use products like makeup and deodorant that are sold in a drugstore and not at a discount store. Buy brands that you see everywhere, not brands you do not see very often. 47 If you get canned foods from out side of the United States, the cans may have lead in them. Check to see if the top of the can is sealed with a thick ring because it may have been sealed with lead. The lead will get into the food that is in the can and you should not eat it. There are more things you can do to protect your family from lead poisoning. Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 34Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 35 PICTURE NUMBER TEXT TO READ ALOUD 48 Look carefully at the other places that your children go to. Make sure that your child ca re center or your neighbor's home does not have chipped paint or lead dust. 49 Look at the playground in the park for chipped paint. The school playground has been tested and is safe. 50 Your children should not play with toys that ar e painted or that contain lead. Your Academic Coach can tell you how to check to see if toys have lead. 51 If you are pregnant, you should not be exposed to lead. 52 You can always talk to a doctor if you are concerned about lead poisoning. Share this information about lead poisoning with your friends and your relatives so that they can also keep their children safe. And you can always talk to your Academic Coach is you have any questions. Lead Poisoning Photo Information Series (Parent Program) 1. 2.

Parent Program 4 - Lead Poisoning 56 Parent Program 5 - Learning About Hate Crime 1 Welcome to Our Schools Parent Program 5: Learning About Hate Crime PURPOSE The purpose of the Parent Programs is to provide information about American schools, reassuring parents that the Academic Coaches will provide guidance and support to re fugee students and their parents throughout the school year, beginning with the Refugee Academy. OBJECTIVES The objectives of the Parent Programs are to: \u0083 Reassure parents that the Refugee Academy and the Academic Coaches will provide guidanc e and support to refugee students. \u0083 Inform parents of the goals and ac tivities of the Refugee Academy. \u0083 Inform parents that even if they do not understand what their children are learning in school, they can be involv ed in education by showing interest, encouragement, and support for hard work and achievement. \u0083 Provide accurate information about the expectations and procedures of American schools, and refute myths and misinformation. \u0083 Build communication between school personnel and parents. \u0083 Build communication among refugee parents. \u0083 Inform parents about school and community resources for students and families. \u0083 Inform parents about school-relat ed paperwork that will facilitate enrollment and preparation for school. \u0083 Inform parents about parental responsibilities in preparing students for school. Parent Program 5 - Learning About Hate Crime 2 FORMAT The format of the Parent Program s should be a combination of presentations by the Academic Coaches and other school personnel, tours of the school, and discussions related to the details of preparing students for school. The Academic Coaches should organize the programs, selecting the activities that will be included so that they ar e connected to the Refugee Academy. The activities of the Parent Program s can be implemented in any order, depending upon the amount of time availabl e. The activities selected may be determined by: \u0083 the comfort level of the parents and t heir familiarity with the school and the Refugee Academy \u0083 the number of languages that need to be translated during the program \u0083 the needs and concerns of the parents \u0083 access to school facilities \u0083 the topics and questions that have been raised by the students in the Academy \u0083 the number of parents attending and their connections with each other \u0083 the arrangements that hav e been made for child care and transportation. The Academic Coaches and other presenter s can determine the pace of Parent Program 5, recognizing that modifica tion of the agenda may have to be made as the programs progress. The background of the parents may range from considerable experience with formal education programs to no experience with schools at all. The presenters should al low significant time for questions. It is also important to recognize that t he information provided in Parent Program 5 can be overwhelming and confusing to parent s, especially if they are trying to learn new terminology, listen to t he translator, and understand what the Academic Coaches are explaining. Teachers of English as a Second Language and translators will be critical participants in the presentations. The topic is a difficult one to present, and Academic Coac hes will have to take the time to approach the topic with sensitivity and compassion. Provide contact information, and make it clear that parents can call the Academic Coaches at any time. Parent Program 5 - Learning About Hate Crime 3Note: Academic Coaches may feel more comfor table if local law enforcement or experts on bias-related crimes present information about hate crime. Academic Coaches should keep in mind that some of the parents might di strust the police and might be afraid to report anyth ing to anyone in a uniform. Discuss this concern ahead of time with the presenters and keep reassuring the parents that the presenters were specifically selected because of their knowledge and support of the refugee community. Additional representatives of the refugee community, such as religious leaders, may also be invited to attend.Parent Program 5 - Learning About Hate Crime 4 Parent Program 5: Learning About Hate Crime Supplies (Parent Program 5) 1) Public service announcement DVDs Don't Hate - Be Kind and Know Something - Tell Someone . 2) Post signs with pictures and arro ws outside of the school and throughout the hallways to direct parents to the Parent Program. Volunteer greeters and translators would be especially hel pful in welcoming parents to the Parent Program. 3) If possible, provide refreshments. 4) Handouts (provided at the end of Parent Program 5) Student Handouts Number & Grade Level of Handout Name of Handout 16-1 (grades 6-8, 9-12) What is Hate Crime? 16-2 (grades 6-8, 9 - 12) Know Something - Say Someone 16-3 (grades K-5, Do I Like to Do? 16-5 (grades 9 - 12) \"If No One Will Listen\" (lyrics) 5) Information on local resources that can assist with reporting hate crime, including contact information. 6) Translations of the lyrics to \" If No One Will Listen \" from Handout 16-5 if the song is going to be discussed with parent s. (Optional: CD of the song to play for parents) 7) Student art work for Handouts 16-3 Who Am I? and 16-4 What Do I Like to Do? 8) Gather pictures of friends from magazines. Parent Program 5 - Learning About Hate Crime 5ACTIVITIES Prior to carrying out Parent Program 5 the Academic Coaches and other presenters should become familiar with the Background Information provided in Module 16: Hate Crime . \u0083 Invite parents to introduce themselves , even if they attended the first four Parent Programs. The parents who are familiar with the school and the Academic Coaches and have had a chance to meet other parents may be willing to greet other parents. Make the introductions informal, but respect the tradi tions of different cultures. Explain to the parents the topics that will be covered in Parent Program 5: Tonight we are going to ta lk about how your children are adjusting to school. They have been faced with a lot of new experiences and have done very well. We will talk tonight about how they can build new friendships and handle situat ions where they might feel afraid or uncomfortable. It may be necessary to take questions i mmediately, in case parents have pressing concerns. Do not wait until t he end of the program if there is a topic that most of th e parents obviously need to discuss. (Maintain confidentiality; do not identify specif ic students.) Keep reassuring parents that there are a number of adults in the school system responsible for helping the children adjust to their new school. \u0083 Discuss how refugee students can make friends in a variety of ways, including in class, on the bus or playground, in loca l neighborhoods, in extra-curricular activities, and in community organizations. Share pictures of friends (cut from ma gazines) so that parents get a visual image of the theme of friendship. Point out to parents that younger ch ildren tend to make friends more quickly, connecting over similar interest s or shared activities. Teachers in the elementary grades often assign \"buddies\" to assist new students in adjusting to the classroom routine. Middle school and high school students tend to be more exclusive, and it is difficult for new students to enter into existing groups of friends or friendships that are well established. Friendships in grades 6-12 can also PARENT PROGRAM 5 Parent Program 5 - Learning About Hate Crime 6be fleeting, when a word or a look can quickly change a relationship. Friendships also change as students become adolescents and relationships with the other gender in fluence communication, interests, attitudes, and priorities. For many refugee students it is not only difficult to comprehend the nuances of relationships, but they do not know how to relate to their peers. They often do not know how to interpret communication between fellow students and are confused and frustrated. They may feel socially isolated, or may deliberately isolate themse lves from others so t hat they do not have to struggle with the pressure of trying to make new friends. Some refugee students may decide that friendships are far more interesting than schoolwork. They may connect quickly with a variety of friends, or may be absorbed into a gr oup that welcomes a new friend. These new friends could be well-in tentioned, but a distraction. And then there are the bullies. Th ere will be students who will tease or even physically hurt refugee students. They may be encouraged by their peers, or may lead others in harassing new students. Refugee student s may handle this by ignoring them and forming new friendships, or they may feel scared and overwhelmed, perhaps even unwilling to go to school. Parent Program 5 emphasizes bias-re lated bullying, which may be illegal. The topic of \"hate crime\" is necessary to discuss so that parents are: \u008b aware of what their children have learned about bias-related or hate crime \u008b aware of the definit ion of hate crime \u008b familiar with the laws related to hate crime \u008b aware of what to do if t hey or their children have experienced or witnessed a hate crime. \u0083 Define and demonstrate kindness as in Module 16: Hate Crime Activity #1: \u008b One presenter drops a book. Another presenter picks it up, dusts it off and hands it to the person who dropped it. Parent Program 5 - Learning About Hate Crime 7\u008b One presenter trips over a backpack. Another presenter helps, asks if they are okay, and then moves the backpack out of the way. \u008b One presenter needs a pen. A nother presenter provides them with a pen. \u0083 Explain that the Refugee Academy classes stress kindness , but the Academic Coaches are aware that so me American students in the school will not be kind. Define \"hate\" (using Module 16: Hate Crime Activity #1 as a guide) and explain that a small number of Amer ican students may actually show hate toward new students because they look and sound different and have cultural and religious traditions that are unfamiliar. \u0083 Explain that when students bully a refugee student and mention their cultural background, race, religion, se xual preference, or disability then those actions are against the law and are called hate cr ime. There are laws in the United States that prot ect victims of a hate crime and punish people who commit hate crime. The younger students have been taught that if they are treated badly by another student, they are to talk to their teacher or Academic Coach. The older students have been taught to ta lk to their teacher or Academic Coach, but have also learned that a crime may have been committed. If they have experienced or witnessed a hate crime, they should talk to their parents or members of their refugee community to get assistance in reporting the crime to local law enforcement \u0083 Show the public service announcements Don't Hate - Be Kind and Know Something - Tell Something. Describe what the students have discussed after they viewed the public service announcements. \u0083 Show the pictures that students have drawn using Handouts 16-3 Who Am I ? and 16-4 What Do I Like to Do? Stress that some students will experience questions and teasing about their appearance, language skills, and culture. But most st udents in American schools will be friendly and supporti ve of new students. Explain that students in the Refugee Academy are learning to take pride in their uniqueness and are showing American students that they may be different Parent Program 5 - Learning About Hate Crime 8from their peers but enjoy the same things as other students. Once the refugee students become more familiar with their new environment, they will make friends and should become comfortable in their new surroundings. Explain that, unfortunately, some American students (and some adults in the community) will make it clear that refugees are not welcome. They do this for many reasons, but mostly because they do not understand other cultures. They may have been taught to distrust anyone who is different from them. The parents will undoubtedly understand this concept because of their past experiences in their native countries. \u0083 Distribute the Handouts 16-1 What is Hate Crime? and 16-2 Know Something - Tell Someone and discuss. Describe how students have been encouraged to report hate crime even if they are afraid. They are protec ting themselves and their refugee community if they tell someone. Par ents will need to support them if they decide to report. Academic Coaches, school officials, and Refugee Resettlement Case Managers are avai lable to provide guidance. \u0083 Discuss local resources for reporting hate crime, whether a victim or a witness. In some areas of New Yo rk State, police departments have separate divisions dedicated to hate crime investigation. If available, distribute contact info rmation for reporting hate crime. \u0083 Discuss the emotional impact of hate crime on victims, witnesses, and the community in general. (See in Module 16: Hate Crime Key Points #2.) \u0083 Some of the older students in the Refugee Ac ademy may have had the opportunity to discuss the lyrics of the song \" If No One Will Listen .\" Share the song lyrics with the parents and what the students discussed in response to the song. See in Module 16: Hate Crime Activity #4 and Handout 16-5. (Optional: Pl ay the CD of the song.) The parents should be aware of the i ssues that were discussed by the students, and should be encouraged to be a resource for emotional support and guidance. If they find it difficu lt to talk to th eir children about the topic (which would not be unusual for any parent), they should ensure that their child makes arrangements to talk to the Academic Coach, school counselor, or Refugee Re settlement Case Manager. And if they as parents are personally experiencing emoti onal struggles in coping with bias-related incidents and hat e crime, they can also go to their Refugee Resettlement Case Manager for support and information. Parent Program 5 - Learning About Hate Crime 9 What can parents do? 1) Parents can discuss the posters and public service announcements with their childr en and ask them if they understand the importance of the messages Don't Hate - Be Kind and Know Something - Tell Someone . 2) Parents can call the Academic Coach if they are concerned about the possibility of bias-related bu llying or hate crime being committed. Sometimes parents know something is wr ong but the child is unwilling to talk about it. But if parents suspect that a child is being teased, especially if the teasing is based on a cultural or re ligious bias, then the parents should talk to the Academic Coach or Re fugee Resettlement Case Manager. Parents may have experienced or witnessed hate crime them selves, or may be aware of children in their community who are victims. It is essential that they alert the Refugee Resettlement Ca se Manager so that they can have assistance in reporting the incident to local law enforcement. The Case Manager (and police officers trained in bias-related crimes) can help refugees in providing crucial information. 3) It is often hard for adults to report incidents, for fear of retaliation or criticism from members of their community. T hey may be concerned that they will cause more problems if they tell. It is even harder for children. They o ften believe that they caused the crime to happen, or may have even deserved to be physically or emotionally hurt. They are already struggling with adju sting to a new school and may feel rejected and alone. Parents can keep telling their children that the majority of the students in American schools are interested in in cluding and befrien ding newcomers. But a handful of students may cause new refugee children to be afraid to go to school. It is important for par ents to talk to teachers, school administrators, Academic Coaches, or the Refugee Resettlement Case Manager so that children can have a re laxed, comfortable adjustment to their new school. 4) Parents should encourage their children to join clubs, sports, and other extracurricular activities where t hey will feel welcome and part of a supportive group. Club supervisors, coaches, and teachers will all emphasize teamwork, mutual support, and supporting others. Refugee children who are feeling socially is olated or bullied should have a safe, comfortable place to form new friendships. Parent Program 5 - Learning About Hate Crime 105) Parents should be alert to the possibility of hate cr ime occurring after school hours. They should be aware of where their children are after school, how they get home from school, and what places students should avoid. This is not always easy for parents of older students. If the parents explain that they are protecti ng them from the few peopl e who might want to do them harm, they can work with their ch ildren to determine the safest places to be when they are not in school. For example, some students may need to change their bus route so that they do not walk alone in some nei ghborhoods. Some parents may want to arrange with other parents for their childr en to walk supervised or walk with a group. The children may complain at fi rst, but they eventually will see that there is safety in numbers and they may even develop new friendships. 6) Parents should encourage students to be proud of their heritage, even if it is differ ent from peers. They should stress the importance of main taining cultural traditions while adjusting to new ways of living. In the Refugee Academy, students are encouraged to teach their peers in their new school about their cultural traditions, since hate crime is often based on stereotypes and misinformation. If they talk about their unique cultural tradi tions, other students can develop appreciation for differences. It should not be the responsibility of refugee students to change the minds of children who have been raised to hate other groups. But sometimes sharing information is a significant way of eliminating hate. 7) If parents are having difficulty themselves in coping with hate crime, they should not hesitate to talk to thei r Refugee Resettlement Case Manager. It is important that they address their own feelings so that they can provide support to their children.

OBJECTIVES Professional development participants will: Become aware of the experiences and concerns of refugee students Learn how to play a valuable role in helping refugee students acclimate to their new school environment Become knowledgeable about the Welcome to Our Schools curriculum, Refugee Academy, Academic Coaches, Parent Programs, Mini-Academies, Brochures for educators and parents, Videos, and school and community-based resources for refugee families 1 Participants in Professional Development If possible, all school personnel should have the opportunity to participate in professional development related to welcoming refugee students to the school district. The following personnel should be invited to attend professional development programs: Faculty Paraprofessionals Administration o School District Superintendents and Assistant Superintendents o Principal s and Assistant Principals o Deans o Subject Area Supervisors o Department Chairs o Guidance Counselors o School Psychologists o School Social Workers o School Nurse s School District Personnel o Cafeteria Employees o Custodians o Hall Monitors o School -based Law Enforcement o School B us Drivers o Playground Aides School districts have demanding professional development requirements. In order to raise awareness and provide tips about educating refugees, find at least 20 minutes to conduct professional development with everyone in the school. This can be done at: New teacher orientations Faculty meetings Subject area department meetings Administrative meetings, especially district-wide councils and supervisor mee tings Staff development programs for school district personnel (cafeteria employees, custodians, hall monitors, etc.) Counselor meetings (guidance counselors, school psychologists and social wo rkers) Curriculum development and interdepartmental meetings School safety and security meetings, including school-based law enforcement personnel and NYS Dignity Act Coordinators Required in-service programs Longer programs can be held during Professional Development days and educational conferences, where all school personnel can attend as a general audience. 2 Instructions for Presenters Professional development programs should be conducted by individuals who work with refugee families, or who are very familiar with the adjustments that refugee students have to make when they enroll in American schools. Representatives from local refugee resettlement centers might be available to either lead the professional development program or speak about the services of their agencies. Teachers of English as a Second Language (ESL), English Language Learners (ELL), or English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) programs may also be comfortable leading the programs or conducting discussions. School administrators or members of the faculty who are familiar with the challenges of helping refugee students adjust should be encouraged to assist in conducting the professional development programs. Those who conduct the professional development programs should recognize that school district personnel may not be familiar with the experiences of refugees. They may not want to reveal that they do not know the culture, languages, and customs of families from other countries. Basic background information should always be provided, including maps, historical and cultural information, and examples of refugee experiences. The information that is provi ded should be general in nature, but should clearly indicate that there can be a variety of traditions, languages, and cultures in one country. Every Participant Should Leave the Professional Development Program Knowing: The name and contact information of the School Impact Program Director or key personnel who assist refugee students such as ESL/ELL/ESOL teachers. The names of the Academic Coaches, mentors, or liaisons to refugee communities. Specific information about the lo cal refugee populations, including their educational background, concerns about school, and school enrollment data. The name of the English as a Second Language (ESL) Program Supervisor and contact information. PowerPoints for professional development can be found on the BRIA website: http://otda.ny.gov/programs/bria/wtos.asp PowerPoint Presenter Notes are on page 2 5 (Professional Development PowerPoint) and page 58 (Hate Crime PowerPoint). 3 The following Key Points should be included in all of the Welcome to Our Schools professional development programs, regardless of the length of the program. 1. The New York State Bureau of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance (BRIA) has provided funding for the implementation of a number of programs across the state that are designed to assist refugee students i n adjusting to American schools. The funding included the development of the Welcome to Our Schools program. The Bureau of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance (BRIA) of the New York State Office of Temporary Disability Assistance (OTDA) secured funding fro m the federal Office of Refugee resettlement for a Refugee School Impact Program. In order to help refugee students and their families who have little knowledge of what school is like in America, BRIA has developed a Welcome to Our Schools program. The program is being used by BRIA providers and school districts across the state to assist refugee students and their parents who face significant impediments to becoming fully acclimated to the United States school system. The Welcome to Our Schools program is designed to: address educational issues that may face school -aged refugee children ease the transition of these refugee children into New York State schools empower refugee parents to be effective partners in the education of their children support loca l school systems most heavily impacted by high numbers of refugee students. To accomplish these goals, the program consistently emphasizes four main themes in the curriculum and learning activities: Expose students and their families to all aspects of th e American educational program so that they become familiar with how educat ion works in their new country . Promote an understanding of the multiple benefits of an American education and encourage refugee students to make t he most of their opportunities . Help students to develop confidence that they will successfully adjust to their new schools. Recognize the contributions that resettled refugees can make to the school district and community. Key Points of Professional Development 4 The Welcome to Our Schools program contains a curriculum for a summer Refugee Academy, consisting of 16 learnin g modules on the following topics: Module 1: American Schools Module 2: Making Friends Module 3: Transportation and Time Module 4: School Rules Module 5: So Much to Learn! Module 6: Stay Healthy Module 7: Interests and Talents Module 8: Getting Help Module 9: Study Skills Module 10: Taking Tests Module 11: Technology and School Module 12: School Safety Module 13: Keeping Families Informed Module 14: Coping with Stress Module 15: Staying Safe Module 16: Hate Crime Also included in the curriculum are: Parent Programs Videos and Guide to the Videos Mini -Academy Curriculum Professional Development Program Posters Primary Level (K-2) Supplementary Activities Brochures for Teachers, School Nurses, Counselors, Administrators, Peer Mentors Brochure: Domestic Abuse: Strategies for Building Healthy Relationships Hate Crime Public Service Announcement 5 2. Refugee students need assistance and support from all school district personnel. Refugee students may enter school at any time during the school year. They have more than likely experienced trauma, including constant hunger, violence, frequent movement to stay safe, and sudden disruption of family life. Many of the refugee students have had little or no schooling, or have experienced educational systems that are very different from the American education system. Some students may have had a high quality education that was interrupted. The families of refugee students are provided with support from local refugee centers, community-based and faith-based organizations, and federal, state, and local governments. They can receive assistance with housing, food, employment, and social services. The children are quickly enrolled in local schools, but it is the school district's responsibility to determine the most effective learning program for each refugee student. School districts can arrange for ESL (English as a Second Language) programs, guidance counselors, teachers, and student mentors to help refugee students acclimate to their new schools. Every adult in the school system who interacts with refugee students can help refugee students adjust comfortably. Faculty members, administrators, counselors, paraprofessionals, and ESL teachers will undoubtedly have the opportunity to provide guidance and reassurance as students learn how to navigate their new school environment. At the same time, school bus drivers, cafeteria workers, hall monitors, school law enforcement officials, custodians, and other school district personnel can have a significant impact on the school experience of refugee students. All school district personnel should be aware of how bewildered refugee students may be. Refugee students usually do not speak English and are overwhelmed with the activity level of American schools. Most refugee students are unfamiliar with having several teachers who encourage class discussions, small group activities, and creativity. They may not know school or classroom rules, cafeteria and transportation systems, and daily tasks such as using a locker, moving from class to class, or finishing homework. Many refugee students are unfamiliar with rest rooms, changing clothes for athletic activities, and speaking in front of groups. After-school and other extracurricular activities are new to refugee students, and they need help in figuring out how to participate. 6 During the professional development programs it is essential to point out that all school district personnel can help refugee students by: Explaining basic activities (e.g., paying for lunch, working a locker combination, playing a game in gym class, riding the bus) Demonstrating behaviors (e.g., lining up for moving through the school halls, raising hand in class, joining clubs) Reassuring students (e.g., praising simple accomplishments, guiding students through fire drills, assisting in organizing school work) Observing refugee students to determine if additional health or guidance services are needed. Identifying students who demonstrate chronic negative behaviors or fail to advance, and recognizing that the behaviors may stem from emotional/social issues related to resettlement. Protecting students from teasing and bullying and teaching them about how to report concerns. Teaching students about the rules of acceptable behavior before disciplining them, especially rules related to Zero Tolerance. The school nurse, physical education teachers, school psychologists, and guidance counselors can monitor the hygiene and physical and mental health of refugee students. In most cases, the parents/guardian of refugee students are coping with huge adjustments in family life. They may not be familiar with the educational system. As school districts assist refugee students in adjusting, they should also be welcoming parents via ESL/ELL/ESOL programs. Refugee community contacts and school interpreters can assist by communicating with non-English speaking parents. 7 Professional Development Activities Professional development programs can consist of one or more of the following activities, depending upon the interests and concerns of the participants, and the amount of time available for the program. For every professional development session: Share the PowerPoint presentation included in this section and available on the BRIA website: http://otda.ny.gov/programs/bria/wtos.asp Include in each presentation information about local resources and school personnel who can assist refugee students. Follow the introduction with specific information about the local refugee population (without giving names), providing details about their experiences, needs, and former education. Follow the introduction with one of the following activities: Activity #1: Large Group Discussion Questions Activity #2: Never Assume Handout Discussion Activity #3: Small Group Discussions Activity #4: Guest Speakers Activity #5: Video Discussions After using the provided PowerPoint to review general background about the Welcome to Our Schools program and local refugee students, the following questions can be discussed with a large group. Give the participants a chance to share ideas, raise concerns, and reveal areas where more education is necessary. Explain that the questions are meant for participants to share knowledge and observations followed by presenter recommendations. ACTIVITY #1: LARGE GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 8 Facilitate the discussion, providing information and correcting misconceptions. 1. On the basis of your observations, what is the most difficult challenge for refugee students who are new to your school? 2. How long does it take for a refugee student to become acclimated to school? (Since it varies depending upon the student, how can school district personnel ease the stress of adjustment?) 3. How can you find out the background of a refugee student and what would you like to know? Why would you like to know it? 4. What do you think embarrasses refugee students the most? What would you do to make sure that refugee students are not embarrassed? 5. How have you communicated with refugee students who are just beginning to learn English? 6. How would you educate other students about the experiences of refugee students without making the refugee students feel uncomfortable? 7. How do refugee students contribute to the educational experience of other students in the school? 8. Who are the school personnel who are responsible for assisting refugee students? How can you contact them? 9. How would you handle communicating with a refugee student in a cafeteria or hallway, when it is a noisy and busy environment? 10. How do you handle situations when other students in the school are rude to refugee students, or tease and harass them? 11. Who can you turn to in this district if you are struggling with communicating with a refugee student? 12. How would you handle lectures and tests when you know that a refugee student in your classroom does not speak English? 13. What will you do tomorrow to help refugee students adjust? 14. How could you use more assistance in addressing the needs of refugee students? Distribute the handouts from pages 16-24 in this module: Handout #2: Tips for Communicating with Refugee Students Handout #3: Never Assume Handout #4: Strategies for Administrators Handout #5: Strategies for Teachers Handout: Evaluation Form 9 Distribute Handout #3: Never Assume (page 17 in this module) either before the professional development session or at the beginning of the session. Either review or read aloud the story about the fourth grade student in Handout #3. Review each item on the handout and explain: o Why refugee students may not know basic information o How refugee students may be embarrassed about their lack of experience, and compensatory behaviors they may use to hide their insecurities o How school district personnel can explain basic information and skills without embarrassing refugee students. Distribute and discuss the handouts on pages 16-24 in this module: Handout #2: Tips for Communicating with Refugee Students Handout #3: Never Assume Handout #4: Strategies for Administrators Handout #5: Strategies for Teachers Handout: Evaluation Form This activity will require more time for adequate small group discussion and follow-up sharing. The presenter may need to select specific questions from Handout #1: Small Group Strategy Questions (page 14 in this module). Divide the large group into small groups. The groups can be organized by mixed professions and a range of experience with refugee students, or by specific specializations. For example: Administrator Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 14, 17, 24, 25 Counselor /Social Worker Questions 1, 2, 5, 6, 12, 13, 15, 19, 20, 23 Teacher Questions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24 District Personnel Questions 1, 6, 7, 11, 14, 24 ACTIVITY #2: NEVER ASSUME HANDOUT DISCUSSION ACTIVITY #3: SMALL GROUP DISCUSSIONS 10 Distribute Handout #1: Small Group Strategy Questions (page 14 in this module). After small group discussions, all of the groups should share their responses with the entire group, with discussion facilitated by the presenter. Each of the groups can also prepare questions for the other groups to discuss, or for the presenter and guests to answer. Distribute the handouts on pages 16-24 in this module: Handout #2: Tips for Communicating with Refugee Students Handout #3: Never Assume Handout #4: Strategies for Administrators Handout #5: Strategies for Teachers Handout: Evaluation Form Invite guest speakers to share information about their experiences working with refugee students and the services they provide refugee families. Ask each presenter to talk for 5-10 minutes about the following: What have you found to be the most challenging about working with refugee children, and what is the most rewarding? What is available in the community to help refugee families? On the basis of your experience in working with refugee families, how can school districts help students adjust? What can the participants in the professional development program do immediately to assist and support refugee students? Guest speakers can be: Representatives from local refugee resettlement centers Represe ntatives from local community-based and faith-based organizations that assist refugee families Representatives from state and local government organizations that assist refugee families Local health care professionals who assist refugee families ESL/ELL/ESOL teachers who are familiar with the students and their families Refugee students who have adjusted to American schools. Refugee Community leaders ACTIVITY #4: GUEST SPEAKERS 11 Distribute the handouts on pages 16-24 of this module: Handout #2: Tips for Communicating with Refugee Students Handout #3: Never Assume Handout #4: Strategies for Administrators Handout #5: Strategies for Teachers Handout: Evaluation Form There are 2 videos that can be shown at Professional Development programs, depending upon the participants and the amount of time available for the program. Each video runs between 15 and 20 minutes. The Guide to the Videos included in the Welcome to Our Schools curriculum provides information on what to highlight prior to showing the videos, and questions for discussion. The vid eo Refugee Student Interviews consists of a series of observations from refugee students about their experiences in their new school. They talk about making friends, daily schedules, after-school activities, the cafeteria, and other topics. The video clearly shows that school district personnel and students can help refugee students to adjust. The video Refugee Parent Interviews consists of refugee parents talking about their experiences in enrolling their children in American schools. Although the video is intended for other refugee parents, it provides important insights about the concerns of refugee parents and can be shown for professional development.

Small Group Strategy Questions - Handout #1 15 Tips for Communicating with Refugee Students Before communicating, ask students about their level of fluency. Some new refugee students may be fluent in English. Speak slowly. Repeat the same sentence without changing the words. Keep sentences simple and clear. Do not use contractions, slang, or jargon. Be alert for inappropriate words and phrases that peers may teach refugee students. Refugee students can often read English better than hear it, so read directions aloud more than once, giving the student a written copy of directions to follow along. Be aware that background noises can interfere with communication. Students may not be able to understand because of the noise of the cafeteria, the school bus, the playground, or the gym class. Try to speak directly to the student or relocate to a quieter area. Seat students on the side or front of the room where they have a good sight line to the teacher and can watch the teacher's face. Walk students through school activities; do not just explain them verbally. For example, activities such as using money in the cafeteria, practicing the locker combination, and working with paints in the classroom may require personal assistance. Do not assume that if a student nods, says \"yes,\" or is silent when responding, that the student actually means \"yes.\" Make sure that the student comprehends what you have told them. Refugee students will often respond with \"yes\" or \"okay \" even if they do not understand. As a refugee student is learning English, modify tasks so that they are similar to the other students', but are shorter and not as complex. Research the cultural traditions of refugee students and how they may influence behavior and communication in school. Refrain from asking personal questions, especially about past history, in front of other students, unless the student volunteers the information. Whenever possible, partner students with classmates who can provide assistance. This experience is helpful for the refugee students and builds new friendships. Tips for Communicating with Refugee Students - Handout #2 16 Never Assume Educators should never assume that refugee students, no matter what their age and background, have basic knowledge about what school is like in America. The following scenario is typical of an American elementary classroom and the perspective of a refugee student: In a recent fourth grade class, the teacher announced that it was time for recess. The students moved quickly to grab their jackets, hats, and gloves, and put on their boots. Then they lined up, talking excitedly, and headed outside to play. A new refugee student sat in her seat, afraid to move. She had just come f rom living in a series of villages, where \"school\" was the occasional gathering of children with very strict adults who punished them if they spoke. Classes were often disrupted by violence or the urgent need to escape to a refugee camp or hiding place. Sh e often fled with the clothes on her back and no shoes, holding tightly to the hand of her older sister. She did not know what recess was, and had no idea where the students were going and if they would ever come back. She could not understand why the students were talking so loudly, risking corporal punishment from the teacher. She watched as the children piled on layers of unfamiliar clothing and then willingly went out into the cold. She watched out the window as they ran laughing around the playground and then settled in groups that played with balls and ropes. The teacher asked her if she would rather color than go outside, and handed her a box of crayons. She did not know what it meant to \"color\" and did not know what to do with the \"crayons.\" It w as all so confusing and discouraging when everyone else seemed to know exactly what to do. For refugee students, deficits in basic knowledge and experience can have a profound effect on learning and skill development. Educators should always keep in mind that most of the refugee students, even those who have experienced forms of education in their native countries, are \"brand new\" at learning in school. Know what they are supposed to do with a crayon, pencil, scissors, glue, or paintbrush. Will be willing to store their backpacks in a locker, out of sight. Know that when they get on a bus they will be able to come back home. Never Assume - Handout #3 NEVER ASSUME THAT REFUGEE STUDENTS : 17 Have seen a picture book. Understand that a clean body includes clean clothes. Understand that every day the entire body should be clean. Desire to \"fit in\" by abandoning their traditional culture. Are convinced that the teacher will be nice and helpful, and not hurt or threaten them. Are comfortable wearing shoes, underwear, socks, and other unfamiliar clothing. Are living in healthy, sanitary conditions, now that they are no longer in their native countries. Are smiling and nodding because they understand teachers, not because they have learned that a smile and a nod pleases teachers. Have used restroom facilities, let alone public restrooms with multiple stalls. Understand that a gang is not an accepted form of an American family. Are healthy, just because they appear to be healthy. Understand that a fire drill means that they will be safe. Are eating lunch every day. Have access to breakfast. Have had a chance to discover talents that they didn't even know they had. Are living with people they know, even if they are relatives. Are able to communicate with their parents about school. Have parents who believe that it is acceptable to be involved in their child's education. Are developmentally at their chronological age. Are being treated well by their peers and not getting teased. Know what it means to be \"on time.\" Have difficulty in school because of their backgrounds, when they could have a learning disability or health problem. Never Assume - Handout #3 18 Have experience sitting at a desk all day. Are used to large crowds of people. Are used to adults talking to them individually. Can adapt quickly to the routine of changing clothes for gym class. Are permitted by their families to participate in all school activities. Trust adults, especially those in uniform. Have ever seen playground equipment or participated in a game or sport. Have ever watched a video. Have established a morning routine that is not stressful. Are allowed to interact with the other gender. Will automatically connect with peers from their native country. Do not harbor ill will against peers from their native country, on the basis of past history of civil wars and violence. Interpret nonverbal cues in the same way as their American peers and teachers. Have forgotten their past, or \"moved on.\" Do not want to talk about their past. Want to talk about their past. Welcome their new lives, even if it means leaving friends and relatives behind in their native countries. Think that they are safe in school. Are having difficulties in school solely because of language barriers, when they actually may be overwhelmed and exhausted from their new school routines. Are participating in school activities because they are comfortable and no longer afraid, when they are actually hiding how they really feel. Are so far behind that they will never catch up, when they can actually adjust quickly if they receive reassurance and guidance. Never Assume - Handout #3 AND NEVER ASSUME THAT REFUGEE STUDENTS : 19 WELCOME TO OUR SCHOOLS REFUGEE SCHOOL IMPACT PROGRAM STRATEGIES FOR ADMINISTRATORS Constantly reassure refugee students and point out daily progress in adjusting. View each child as unique. Do not make assumptions based on cultural background. Research the native countries of refugee students. Ask general questions about climate, terrain, foods, and traditions. Avoid personal questions about family and friends in native countries, political issues, and experiences as refugees. To engage students in welcoming refugee students, encourage them to mentor new students and to praise progress as students adjust to American schools. Stress the advantages of having students from around the world in the classrooms. Match refugee students up with buddies who can be good role models and will not be uncomfortable guiding students who do not speak English. Encourage refugee students to share information with family members, and stress that family members are welcome to call, e-mail, and attend school events. For many refugee students, parents were not expected to communicate with their child's school. Reach out to parents and invite them personally to participate in school events. Introduce refugee students to school district personnel who will be in the hallways, cafeteria, and playground. Never assume that refugee students know school rules and procedures, even those that are basic such as walking in the halls, raising hands, arriving at class on time, etc. Teach every rule and review it. Educate before disciplining. Refugee students will adjust faster if they have developed friendships. Encourage them to participate in clubs, after-school activities, sports, and school functions, to broaden opportunities for making new friends. If refugee students are still learning English but are participating in classes in subject areas, view the classroom experience as social immersion. Focus on helping the students learn school rules and procedures, meet fellow students, and become comfortable with the teachers. Academic work, grades, and tests will follow. Strategies for Administrators - Handout #4 20 Discuss the background of refugee students with ESL teachers and tutors, to determine how much the student understands, how the student is adjusting, and how much education the student has had. In some countries, the students have had a rigorous education, but their schooling was interrupted. Do not assume that students are monolingual, are not comprehending, or have limited educational background. Find out about the backgrounds of the students to better facilitate learning. They may be understanding English, but are unable to speak it clearly. Share information about student backgrounds with key personnel. Determine if there is a district policy about placement and grading of refugee students. o If not, consult with ESL and classroom teachers to determine school policies. Develop policies based on the cultural context and experiences of the refugee students, recognizing that policies may include a number of different assessment strategies. Support alternative instructional strategies for refugee students, including the use of cultural frames of reference, differentiated instruction, and social immersion. Refugee students need to feel comfortable in their new setting before they can seriously start learning in English. Keep an eye out for signals that refugee students are floundering, bullied, connecting with students who are often disciplined, or exhibiting negative behaviors. Before quickly disciplining, consult with ESL teachers and guidance counselors to determine whether the student is having difficulty adjusting or does not understand the rules and consequences. Establish a school climate that does not tolerate bullying, harassment, or racism. This is difficult, but constant reinforcement of expectations and clear respect for differences will assist refugee students in adjusting to their new environments. Stress the value of diversity. Arrange for professional development sessions on cultural competence. Train all school personnel in communication strategies when talking to refugee students. Show how phrases such as \"Where are you supposed to be?\" and \"Where is your pass?\" may confuse refugee students and cause them to be disciplined. Ensure that cafeteria workers, playground aides, law enforcement personnel, custodians, and any other workers in the school are aware of the enrollment of refugee students in the school. Recognize that teachers will be frustrated and occasionally uncomfortable when responsible for teaching refugee students, particularly in academic subjects that require considerable amounts of reading and writing. Facilitate instructional support, English language instruction, tutors, and other arrangements to support faculty. Strategies for Administrators - Handout #4 21 WELCOME TO OUR SCHOOLS REFUGEE SCHOOL IMPACT PROGRAM STRATEGIES FOR TEACHERS Constantly reassure refugee students and point out daily progress in adjusting. View each child as unique. Do not make assumptions based on cultural background. Remember that basic activities are all new to refugee students. Explain basic steps, demonstrate, and reinforce several times. For example, show how a pencil is used, how it can be sharpened, how to write on the lines of notebook paper, and how to erase. (Demonstrate this to students K-12.) Research the native countries of refugee students. Ask general questions about climate, terrain, foods, and traditions. Avoid personal questions about family and friends in native countries, political issues, and experiences as refugees. To engage students in welcoming refugee students, encourage them to mentor new students and to praise progress as students adjust to American schools. Stress the advantages of having students from around the world in the classrooms. Teach key words and phrases in English that will help refugee students follow classroom activities, such as line up , take out your paper and pencil , homework is on the board , and work in a group . Use online translation programs, if possible. Match refugee students up with buddies who can be good role models and will not be uncomfortable guiding students who do not speak English. Encourage refugee students to participate in group work, recognizing that many refugee students have never experienced group discussions in school. Develop the \"whole\" child by looking for unique skills or talents, encouraging interests, and exposing refugee children to subjects and activities that they may never have experienced before. Encourage refugee students to share information with family members, and stress that family members are welcome to call, e-mail, and attend school events. For many refugee students, parents were not expected to communicate with their child's school. Reach out to parents and invite them personally to participate in school events. Introduce refugee students to school district personnel who will be in the hallways, cafeteria, and playground. Strategies for Teachers - Handout #5 22 Never assume that refugee students know school rules and procedures, even those that are basic such as walking in the halls, raising hands, arriving at class on time, etc. Teach every rule and review it. Educate before disciplining. Refugee students will adjust faster if they have developed friendships. Encourage them to participate in clubs, after-school activities, sports, and school functions, to broaden opportunities for making new friends. Establish a classroom that is safe by encouraging cooperation and respect. Ease the stress of traumatized refugee students by explaining fire drills, partnering the student with helpful students, valuing cultural diversity, and praising refugee students for basic tasks. If refugee students are still learning English but are participating in classes in subject areas, view the classroom experience as social immersion. Focus on helping the students learn school rules and procedures, meet fellow students, and become comfortable with the teachers. Academic work, grades, and tests will follow. Discuss schoolwork, including grades and tests, with ESL (English as a Second Language) teachers, administrators, and guidance counselors. Determine if there is a school policy about placement and grading of refugee students. Discuss the background of refugee students with ESL teachers and tutors, to determine how much the student understands, how the student is adjusting, and how much education the student has had. In some countries, the students have had a rigorous education, but their schooling was interrupted. Distribute the same classroom materials to all students, even if the refugee students cannot speak English. Differentiate classroom assignments so that the refugee students can be successful in doing the homework, but can also become familiar with the textbooks and other instructional materials. Many refugee students will be overwhelmed with the amount of stimulus in the school. Assist students in concentrating on the task at hand and achieving small steps toward adjustment. Do not assume that students are monolingual, are not comprehending, or have limited educational background. Find out about the backgrounds of the students to better facilitate learning. They may be understanding English, but are unable to speak it clearly. Keep an eye out for signals that refugee students are floundering, bullied, connecting with students who are often disciplined, or exhibiting negative behaviors. Before quickly disciplining, consult with ESL/ELL/ESOL teachers and guidance counselors to determine whether the student is having difficulty adjusting or does not understand the rules and consequences.

Comment: Suggested additional programs: Evaluation Form - Handout 24 Using the following PowerPoint Notes for Presenters , show the Power Point presentation entitled Welcome to Our Schools . The PowerPoint can be shown to a general audience or to groups that are organized by specialization (faculty, administration, guidance counselors, etc.). The PowerPoint Notes for Presenters contains suggestions for additional information that can be shared after showing each slide. Representatives from Refugee Centers, community-based organizations, guidance offices, and ESL/ELL/ESOL departments can also provide commentary as the slides are shown. Refugee students who have adjusted to the school district may also be invited to share their observations and experiences during the presentation. Questio ns from the participants can be taken during the presentation or afterward. Emphasis in the presentation should be on how important it is that all school district personnel welcome refugee students to the new schools. POWER POINT NOTES FOR PRESENTERS PowerPoints for professional development can be found on the BRIA website: http://otda.ny.gov/programs/bria/wtos.asp 25Explain the components of the local Refugee School Impact Program. 26Describe the purposes of the presentation: To raise awareness about the experiences and needs of refugee students. To provide suggestions about what school district personnel can do to help students to adjust and excel. 27Without giving names, provide examples of experiences of local refugee families and why they sought refuge. Describe the mixed emotions of students and family members about fleeing to America. 28Provide examples of specific refugee camps and conditions. Without giving names, provide examples of experiences of local refugee children. 29Explain how experiences in refugee camps can influence the behavior and expectations of local refugee students. Be specific. 30Provide examples of what families are able to bring with them to the United States. 31Describe the services that are available to local refugee families. 32Discuss how basic housing, heat, food, clothing, etc. can influence school experiences of refugee students. Describe specific services that are offered in the school district, such as free breakfast and lunch, coverage of fees for extra-curricular activities, donated school supplies, ESL/ELL/ESOL, etc. 33Describe the enrollment process and the role of parents, administrators, teachers, school bus drivers, and other school district personnel. Stress the supportive role, rather than the rules and paperwork. Explain how an American school can be overwhelming to any new student, particularly those who do not speak English and may not have attended school. Explain that some refugee students have had their own education suddenly disrupted and may have a hard time adjusting because they are used to their own systems and may miss their teachers and friends. 34Describe other school activities that may be brand new to refugee students. Emphasize basic school experiences such as: Lockers, Backpacks, Recess and sports, Music and the Arts, Classroom supplies such as books, puzzles, pencils Share the items listed on Handout #3: Never Assume 35Ask the participants to answer the question, \"Would you keep it out of sight in your locker?\" Explain why some refugee students are reluctant to store their belongings in a locker. (The backpack may be the only personal belongings the refugee student has ever owned.) 36Discuss how difficult it is to navigate the school cafeteria, especially in the middle and high schools. Describe student confusion about: Lunch payment systems Vending machines Throwing away leftovers Who to sit with in the cafeteria 37Describe the educational experiences of refugee students, varying from: No education Little education, often interrupted Temporary schools in refugee camps, homes, etc. Fully functioning schools that had to be left behind Teachers who stressed harsh discipline Teachers who will be remembered and missed 38Describe the first day of school from the perspective of a new refugee student (Presenters may wish to follow the PowerPoint with the DVD: Interviews with Refugee Parents or Interviews with Refugee Students .) 39Describe local ESL/ELL/ESOL programs and how they support refugee students. Describe the local process of assessing educational levels and skills. Describe the difficulties in determining skills and grade placement. Without giving names, provide specific examples of how students have learned English and adjusted. 40Describe ESL/ELL Programs Describe the possible social, emotional, and health care needs of refugee students. Post-traumatic stress disorder Serious health problems Grief from loss of family and friends Struggles to maintain cultural and religious traditions Describe local support services Describe school-based advocacy or counseling programs. 41Describe how the original funding was the impetus for the development of Refugee Academies. Federal funding, administered by BRIA (NYS Bureau of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance) 42Explain the addition of: Activities for grades K-2 to supplement the elementary activities in the Modules Guide for Academic Coaches 43Share copies of the brochures for: Teachers Administrators Counselors Peer Mentors Nurses 44Discuss the important role of friendships and social skills to facilitate adjustment, even before academics. Describe how younger students make friends on the playground and in classroom activities. Older students have already formed closer friendships and groups, making it harder for new students to make friends. Middle and high school students tend to place more emphasis on conformity, especially in the areas of dress, language, attitude, and interests. Describe how it may be difficult for older refugee students to \"fit in\" and form friendships. 45Stress how quickly students can adjust, with support and guidance. Discuss examples of the enthusiasm of some refugee students. 46Point out that even if students are excited about attending their new school, they can be scared. The Refugee Academy, Mini-Academies and Academic Coaches address their confusion and fears. 47Review each item and provide examples. 48Review each item and provide examples. 49If possible, show the Welcome to Our Schools Refugee Academy curriculum. Describe the key points and activities for the topics listed on the slide. Share anecdotes about the participation of the refugee students in the Refugee Academy. 50Explain that the activities are designed to assist refugee students in adjusting to American schools. Discuss the additional module on Hate Crime, the expanded module on bullying, and the Domestic Abuse: Building Health Relationships brochure. 51For each item, provide specific names, office locations, and contact numbers/emails. 52Ask the participants to highlight basics for each item. For example: Bus behavior: Waiting for the bus, Punctuality, Seating, Safety, Entering and exiting the bus, Crossing the street, Bus driver communication Direct the participants to the New York State Dignity Act on the New York State Education Department (NYSED) website. A Dignity Act Resource Guide for School Administrators and Faculty was completed in December 2013 and can be found on the NYSED website. 53Ask ESL teachers to discuss strategies for verbal communication with students who do not speak English. For each item, provide specific demonstrations and examples. 54Provide information on what school district personnel can look for, and who to contact if they are concerned about a refugee student. 55Provide examples of how participants can help. 5657 HATE CRIME POWER POINT WITH NOTES FOR PRESENTERS 58Explain the components of the local Refugee School Impact Program. 59Describe the purpose of the presentation: To provide information about bias -related incidents and hate crimes. To raise awareness about the experiences and needs of refugee students, particularly in relation to hate crime. 60Define \"refugee.\" 61Provide examples of specific countries and why families seek refuge and resettle in the United States. 62Provide examples of experiences of refugee children. 63Provide examples of conditions of refugee camps. 64Explain that most refugee children are remarkably resilient and adjust comfortably to American schools, after initial struggles with language and customs. 65Describe examples of physical and mental health issues, including examples of behaviors related to post -traumatic stress syndrome. 66Describe local support services and school -based advocacy or counseling programs. 67Explain that there is a federal definition (next slide) and States have adopted their own definitions. 68Explain that the key word is \"crime\" -indicating that it is a criminal offense involving law enforcement and the course system. 69Explain that stereotypes are when certain behaviors, abilities, interests, or values are attributed to one group of people. Example of stereotype: Girls are not very good in math. Explain that bias is behavior that results from a belief in the stereotypes . To continue the example: Some people discourage girls from pursuing careers in math and science because their underlying belief is that girls are not very good in math. That behavior is biased , based on a stereotype . Hate crime is based on stereotypes about groups of people. It is bias-related crime. (NOTE: Do NOT provide any other examples of stereotypes and bias. Go to the next slide.) 70Explain that prejudice is another way of explaining beliefs in stereotypes. 71Explain that some people have perceptions about certain groups of people that are not true. Then they make decisions about that entire group of people. (NOTE: Do NOT provide specific examples of prejudice. Go directly to the next slide.) 72NOTE: Go immediately to the next slide. 73Explain that there are many causes of prejudice, but the research shows consistently that children learn prejudice from adults -and from their peers. Explain that the literature also shows that what has been learned can be unlearned . 74Explain that some organized groups teach young people and adults how to show their hate with violence against property and people. 75Just as prejudice can be taught, children and adults can learn about the origins of stereotypes and bias and unlearn prejudice. But without education and guidance, prejudice can turn to hate and may result in criminal behaviors. 76Explain that refugees can be targets of violence and hate speech. Note that they are \"targets,\" not \"victims.\" 77Hate speech is harder to determine -but there is often written documentation. 78Explain that refugees are often singled out because they are different -different in color, dress, language, customs, social behaviors, even eating habits. (Note: Do not provide specific examples. Go directly to the next slide.) 79Explain that refugees at all levels of education have experienced bias -related incidents. Explain that Middle School students appear to target refugee students more often than other grade levels, but they are also the age group that is more open to unlearning prejudice. Eliminating prejudice starts with building relationships and friendships --- something that is very important to children at any age. Explain that schools are now responsible for keeping an eye on bias -related incidents. 80School administration should be well -informed about New York State Education Department (NYSED) requirements, and more information is provided on the NYSED website. 81ASK: What is meant by characteristics ? (See next slide) 82Explain that the New York State Education Department definition is taken directly from the National Center for Education Statistics, which is why it includes so many characteristics. 83Explain that in July 2011 the New York State Dignity for All Students Act took effect. It is a measure to protect students from harassment and discrimination. The bill directs school districts to develop procedures which create discrimination -free and harassment -free schools. Further information can be found on the New York State Education Department website. 84There is often confusion about the difference between an \"immigrant\" and a \"refugee.\" Review the definition of refugee as discussed in the opening slides. Explain that refugees undergo extensive health and security review before resettling, and the United States is one of many countries that welcomes refugees. Comment that refugees have already experienced trauma, so the impact of hate crimes can be especially powerful. 85ASK: What is the impact of hate crimes on refugees? 86Physical: Injury, pain, rehabilitation Educational: Threatening and harassment can cause a child to skip school, lose sleep, drop out of school Financial: A storefront covered with graffiti can cause a financial impact on a refugee family. Social: Withdrawal, isolation, distrust 87They are not sure who to trust. Explain that refugee children already may fear law enforcement because of incidents in their native countries. They may start to distrust some of their peers or adults in their new country. They need reassurance more than ever that they are welcome. 88Explain that PTSD is post -traumatic stress disorder and that some refugees already experience this disorder as a result of events in their native countries. Hate crime can trigger PTSD. 89For all hate crime there is an emotional impact. For some targets, there is a feeling of embarrassment and self -doubt. For some cultures, the attack is viewed as bringing shame on the family. The most common response is fear of reprisals, repeated violence, and distrust. 90Explain the role of Refugee Resettlement Case Managers and Academic Coaches 91Provide names and contact information for Refugee Resettlement Case Managers, Academic Coaches, Dignity Act Coordinators, school -based law enforcement officials, and other school officials responsible for school safety Explain that the primary role of those who assist refugees is to help them to feel comfortable in their new country. 92Explain that the quote is from a Refugee Resettlement Case Manager 93Stress that students and school personnel are overwhelmingly kind and helpful to refugee children, but hate crime does happen enough to warrant guidelines and training. Explain that some systems need to be put in place so that prejudice cannot thrive. 94Explain that schools alone cannot solve the problem of prejudice. But schools can provide guidelines and activities that encourage students to be kind. 95Remind that with education and guidance, hate can be unlearned. 96Explain that the best way for students to reduce prejudice is for them to get to know each other. Many schools have International Festivals and other events. Those events are enlightening and develop cultural understanding. 97But the key is for students to be able to talk to each other and get to know each other as individual people. Establish a peer mentor program Partner young students with \"buddies\" Encourage refugee students to join a club or sport -facilitate enrollment. They will be supervised by adults and meet new friends. 98Explain that the tone of the school is immediately evident by signs, posters, artwork, posted rules and expectations, but should be reinforced with clear expectations and activities. 99Describe the activities of the Welcome to Our Schools Program that help to inform refugee students about: Hygiene Use of rest rooms School behaviors and rules Techonology safety ( cyberbullying ) Routines in lunch room, locker room 100Discussions with students should be about the importance of respecting diversity and individuality. Do not lecture about basic concepts such as respect and tolerance. Establish clear expectations, explaining the reason behind the expectations, including that there are hate crime laws . 101Explain that zero tolerance starts with individual classrooms. Stress that school personnel are not expected to constantly monitor the prejudice level of the students. But teachers can make it clear that in their classrooms they will not tolerate bias - related behaviors or hate speech. Bus drivers, cafeteria workers, and other personnel can also make it clear that they do not tolerate bias -related behaviors or hate speech. School personnel should know where to report concerns and observations. 102Recognize that in some schools the students routinely engage in teasing, taunting, and biased language, often in a joking manner. The targets themselves may laugh and return the insults. 103Conduct professional development to discuss the reality of disrespectful behavior, teasing, and bullying -and how to address it. Respectful behavior begins with individual teachers establishing parameters in their classrooms. Teachers need administrative support if disrespectful behavior continues. Administrators need guidance on how to balance parent values, student experiences, and school expectations related to respectful behavior. Begin with being alert to the possibility of hate crime. 104Explain that it is sometimes difficult to determine if an action is a bias -related incident or hate crime. Legal experts will determine whether it is a hate crime, but incidents should be reported. 105Explain that district personnel responsible for school safety are responsible for establishing guidelines about identifying hate crime. (Go directly to the next slide.) 106Some guidelines are provided by the State -Guidelines can be obtained from the NYS Center for School Safety and other school districts. 107(Go directly to the next slide.) 108(Go directly to the next slide.) 109(Go directly to the next slide.) 110Explain that many school systems have established systems for reporting any type of concern anonymously. Some communities rely on local law enforcement systems for reporting incidents. 111The New York Center for School Safety provides assistance to districts as well as a hotline for anyone who wants to report a possible school safety problem. 112Remember that the action may be a crime and should be handled by the legal system. 113(Go directly to the next slide.) 114(Go directly to the next slide.) 115(Go directly to the next slide.) 116117 WELCOME TO OUR SCHOOLS GUIDE TO THE VIDEOS A Day in Elementary School A Day in Middle School A Day in High School Refugee Student Interviews Refugee Parent Interviews NEW YORK STATE OFFICE OF TEMPORARY AND DISABILITY ASSISTANCE OFFICE OF REFUGEE A ND IMMIGRANT ASSISTANCE Table of Contents Page Purpose and Objectives of the Videos .......................................................................... 1 Description of the Videos ............................................................................................... 3 A Day in El ementary School .......................................................................................... 3 A Day in Middle Sc hool .................................................................................................. 3 A Day in High Sc hool ..................................................................................................... 3 Refugee Student Interviews ........................................................................................... 3 Refugee Parent Interviews ............................................................................................. 3 How to Use the Videos ................................................................................................... 4 Key Points of the Videos ................................................................................................ 5 Video Vocabulary A Day in El ementary School .......................................................................................... 7 A Day in Middle Sc hool ................................................................................................. 10 A Day in High Sc hool .................................................................................................... 13 Refugee Student Interviews .......................................................................................... 16 Refugee Parent Interviews ............................................................................................ 19 Find In the Videos A Day in El ementary School ......................................................................................... 21 A Day in Middle Sc hool ................................................................................................. 23 A Day in High Sc hool .................................................................................................... 25 Table of Contents, continued Page Video Questions for Discussion A Day in El ementary School ......................................................................................... 27 A Day in Middle Sc hool ................................................................................................. 30 A Day in High Sc hool .................................................................................................... 33 Refugee Student Interviews .......................................................................................... 36 Video Scripts A Day in Elementar y School Vid eo Scri pt ..................................................................... 38 A Day in Middle School Video Script ............................................................................. 43 A Day in High Sc hool Video Script ................................................................................ 49 Refugee Student Interv iews Video Script ...................................................................... 55 Refugee Parent Inte rviews Video Script ....................................................................... 71 Videos The instructor will have to determine the best way to show the videos, depending upon the languages spoken by the students, the equipment available, and the number of Academic Coaches and translators. Each DVD has all five videos: A Day in Elementary School A Day in Middle School A Day in High School Refugee Student Interviews Refugee Parent Interviews Translated Videos: To order a DVD in any of the following languages email bria.contact@otda.ny.gov : English, Chinese, Burmese, Arabic, Haitian-Creole, Karen, French, Russian, Maay, Nepali, Spanish, Swahili, Somali, Vietnamese, and Karenni.Guide to the Videos 1WELCOME TO OUR SCHOOLS GUIDE TO THE VIDEOS INTRODUCTION PURPOSE OF THE VIDEOS Five videos have been created to assist refugee students in understanding what a day in Americ an school can be like. The videos show the inside of elementary, middle, and high schools, the interactions of students and their teac hers, the supplies that students use, and the resources available in schools. The videos also show interviews with refugee students and parents who have a rrived in the United States within the last four years. The students and parents talk about their experiences, observations, and advice to newcomers. The purpose of the videos is to give refugee students the opportunity to actually see American schools in operation. Many of t he students in the Refugee Academy or Mini-Academy will be new to the school system. They may have been given information about school, but unless they have actually had a chance to visit a school and spend the day there, they probably do not know what to envision. Even students who are familiar with their new school may need to see the schools of their siblings , or to see aspects of school that they may not yet have experienced. OBJECTIVES OF THE VIDEOS Students will: \u0083Be able to compare similarities a nd differences of the schools in the videos and their own school. \u0083Be prepared to attend school knowi ng what is routine and expected in American schools. \u0083Be reassured as they become familia r with the environment and activities of American schools.Guide to the Videos 2Of course the schools that are depicted in the videos are not the actual schools of the refugee students, but there are more similarities than differences. The first objective of the videos is to prompt students and the instructor to talk about what is the same and what is different. For example, students in the vi deo are playing instruments in the school band, working and talk ing together in groups, and playing football. Refugee student s should have the opportunity to compare notes about the schools in the videos and their own school. Will they be able to do the same things as the students shown in the videos? Perhaps thei r playground is a parking lot, and recess is not held every day. Perhaps their school has an award-winning theatre program, but does not have a gymnasium. The videos show students wearing many different styles of clothing, but perhaps the st udents watching the video attend schools where they are expected to wear uniforms. In the videos, the high school has a swimming pool, the students are allowed to wear coats and backpacks in school, and there is a police officer in the school all day long. Does the local school look the same, offer the same programs, and have the same rules? The instructor can use the videos to discuss the specific characteristics of the schools t hat the refugees will be attending. The videos should be used as a springboard for discussion. The second objective of the videos is for students to feel prepared. The videos will help them to determine what they might need for school, what to expect during the school day, and how to behave appropriately. They will have the chance to see students using their lockers to store school supplies, raising their hands to ask questions in class, and taking notes while the teacher lectures or gives directions. For some refugee students, these school behaviors will not be unfamiliar. In fact, they may be reassuring because they will see that many aspects of school are the same around the world. For other refug ee students, it is important for them to see what is expected in school so that the refugee students do not get embarrassed or disciplined if they do not understand how to behave. The third objective of the videos is for students to relax and absorb the visual information presented. The instructor should not use the videos as a means of testing, or as a tool for me morizing school rules. The videos are filled with multiple levels of information, and it will take more than one viewing for students to absor b everything that is shown. During one viewing they may c oncentrate on the words of the narrator or students who are intervie wed, but the second time they Guide to the Videos 3may be studying the background scenes , looking at the classroom activities, or watching t he behavior of t he students. The instructor should give t he students a chance to sit back and take in whatever interests them . (See Key Point #3 below.) For most students, the vi deos will help to clarif y concerns and answer questions, but for some students the visual imagery and content may be overwhelming. All of the students should be able to watch the video with the understanding t hat they can ask questions and watch it again. The instructor can use the Vocabulary and Discussion Questions to facilitate discussion, or just serve up the popcorn and let the students relax and watch the videos. DESCRIPTION OF THE VIDEOS All of the videos highlight the experiences of refugee students. A Day in Elementary School A routine day of a 4th grade class, from arriving at school to participating in after school activities. A Day in Middle School A routine day of students in middle school, from arriving to school, moving from class to class, and participat ing in after school activities. A Day in High School A routine day for students in high school , from arriving to school, moving from class to class (including advanced and elective classes), and participating in after school activities. Refugee Student Interviews Refugee Parent Interviews In both of these videos, refugee students of all ages and their parents and guardians talk openly about their observations and experiences related to entering a new school and adjusting to the school environment. Topics discussed in the videos are: o meeting friends o getting ready for school(school bus, hygiene, school supplies, lockers) o so much to learn (classroom activities, classes) o in the classroom (schedules, sch ool subjects, learning English, tests, homework) Guide to the Videos 4 o stay healthy (gym, sports, cafete ria, lunch menu, recess, nurse) o interests and talents (sports, drama, choir, computers, clubs, Art, books) o getting help (teachers, tutoring, after-school programs, friends, counselors, ESL) o follow school rules and be safe (fire drill, pass, rules, behavior) o home-school communication (parent meetings, teacher conference, contacting schools) o no worries! (initial feelings, t eachers, stress, doing well in school) HOW TO USE THE VIDEOS After selecting the video to be shown, there are a number of instructional strategies that can be used: \u0083 Show the video without discussion pr ior to the viewing. Respond to student questions afterwards. \u0083 Discuss the Vocabulary included in the Guide to the Videos, and then show the video. \u0083 Assign items to look for and discuss afterward, using Find in the Video on pages 21, 23, and 25 in this Guide to the Videos. \u0083 Use the Questions for Discussion on pages 27, 30, 33 in this Guide to the Videos , before and after showing the videos. \u0083 Show the students the video that is aimed at their age level, but show them the other grades, too. Many students will hav e siblings in other schools, or will just be curious about what it is like to be in a school building with other grade levels. \u0083 Stop and start the video, discussing t he contents of different interview sections, or different parts of the school day. For example, in the video A Day in Elementary School , the instructor can show the scenes that pertain to recess, physical education, and s ports, discussing health and hygiene, clothes required for gym class and sports teams, how to try out for teams, etc. \u0083 Show the video Refugee Parent Interviews at parent meetings. Parents will also benefit fr om seeing the video Refugee Student Interviews. Guide to the Videos 5 1. American schools have similar rules and systems. The schools that are shown in the videos are in urban and subur ban areas of New York State. Most of the sc hool day that is depicted (or discussed by the students and parents in the interviews) is similar to what happens in schools nationwide. The instructor should point ou t, as is explained in the Refugee Academy Curriculum Module 4: School Rules and Module 5: So Much to Learn , that the process of schooling is generally consistent in all schools. Students are expected to sit in their seats in the classroom, respectfully listen to the teacher, talk quietly if allowed, move through the halls quickly to the next cl ass, have supplies handy for school work, and so forth. In mo st schools, homework is assigned on a regular basis, school work is graded by teac hers, students have tests to prepare for, and there are required classes that everyone must take. As the students view the videos, it is important that the instructor highlight the rules and systems that are the same as in the schools that the students will be attending. However, new refugee students should be aware that every school has its own unique organization, environment, rules, and ac tivities. The schools in the videos, for example, encourage students to work in small groups and often grade students on their collaboration and teamwork. Some schools that the refugee students will be attending may not allow group work and ma y be more structured. Or the schools may be even more relaxed, encouraging stu dents to learn independently at their own pace, with less emphasis on grades. The Instructor can clarify what is diffe rent about the schools in the videos. If the refugee students have already been enrolled in the local schools, they can assist in pointing out what is the sa me and what is different. 2. Refugee students will adjust to their new schools. Showing the video Refugee Student Interviews is one of the best ways to reassure students that they will be able to successfully adjust to their new school. The students on the video talk about what it felt like to enter sc hool for the first time, how long it took to learn Englis h, and what the first few weeks were like. They are very open about how nervous and scared they were. Yet they also consistently talk about how they quickly made new friends, how their teachers and guidance counselors helped them to adjust, and how their ESL teachers helped them with learning English and doing school work. Although the interviews were edited for ti me, the theme of the lengthy interview process was very clear as students talk ed with enthusiasm about their experiences adjusting. There were very few negative comments to edit (and students were quite Key Points of the Videos Guide to the Videos 6relaxed and open about their observations.) They talked about some rough spots, especially with the o ccasional bullies who would teas e or imitate refugee students, but with patience and a lot of support fr om teachers and couns elors, the students were able to adjust and enjoy going to sc hool. They talked about how quickly they were able to make new friends and how classmates helped them to learn new skills and complete class assignments. They talked about what their day is like now, using vocabulary related to American schools that some of them learned for the first time that year, such as locker, tutoring , and Social Studies . They are a living example of how adjusting to American schools is possible and, in fact, enjoyable. The instructor should use the students on the videos as examples of what is possible. They should stress that being afraid and worried about attending an American school is normal, and the Academic Coaches and teachers are to be used as resources. They should acknowledge t hat not every student or teacher will be receptive and kind, but refugee students can turn to their new friends and their Academic Coaches for support. The ESL teachers, discussed often by t he students in the videos, should meet the refugee students and be avail able to assist them. 3. The information in the videos may be overwhelming to some students. The videos are filled with so much information and so many things to look at, that the viewing experience may be interesting but overwhelming to some students. The Instructor should pay close attention to t he reactions of the students as they watch the videos. For some refugee students, the videos w ill emphasize that sc hools around the world can be similar. Those students will recognize elements of American schools that they remember from their native countries. They may recall teachers lecturing and writing on the board, classmates sitting in desks and taking notes or listening to stories in their classrooms, and classe s going outside to play games with other students. Once they see that the process is similar to what they remember, they may feel better prepared to adjust to their new school. But for many refugee students, especially t hose who have never received any formal schooling, the information provided in t he videos may be very overwhelming. There is a lot of activity in a school day, many rules to follow, and systems to learn. This can be especially true if a student is enter ing a middle school or high school, where changing classes can be daunting even for American students who are familiar with the system. If refugee students seem to be having difficult y absorbing all of the information in the videos, or the content seems to make them anxious, the instructor should refer to the Key Ideas and Activities in the Refugee Academy Curriculum , especially Module 1: American Schools , Module 2: Making Friends , and Module 3: Getting Help . The instructor can discuss one section of the video at a time, using the Questions for Discussion found on pages 27, 30, and 33 in this Guide to the Videos. Guide to the Videos 7 VOCABULARY A DAY IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL The following vocabulary list consists of words and phrases that are school- related and used in the videos. The voc abulary may be new to refugee students. The primary purpose of the videos is to inform students about what a day can be like in American schools. It may be helpful to review some of the key words and phrases that are used routinely in American education. Some words can be especially confusing, such as gym, PE, class , and lab. The list is in the order of w hen they are used in the videos. The vocabulary words can be review ed in different ways, depending upon the background of the students: \u0083 Define or translate each vocabulary word, recognizing that the students may not be able to fully comprehend the words until they see the videos (e.g., locker, field hockey, orchestra, recess). \u0083 Assign each student a specific word/phrase from the vocabulary list to look for in the video. For example, one student can look for a backpack , while another student looks for a computer . After the video is shown, discuss the context in which the words were used. \u0083 Show the entire video so that students get a general overview. Then show the video again, stopping periodically to point out specific vocabulary words. \u0083 Review the vocabulary words and show the video. Then discuss the vocabulary words again, asking students to describe what they saw when they spotted the use of the word in the video. For example, if the word is gymnasium , ask the students what the gymnasium looked like and how it was used or discussed by the students in the video.

The students may need guidance about what the items look like and where the items may be seen in the video. For example, a hula hoop , a librarian, a notebook and a lunch box are all on the list. (Some of these words may have been reviewed during the discussion of vocabulary.) For example, if the student s are asked to look for a notebook , the instructor can show an example of a notebook and suggest that they students look inside the lockers, desks, and backpacks in the video. Where do they see the notebooks? What do they look like and how are they used? Each student can be assigned a specific item to look for, or the entire list can be shared with the class. The instructor should inform the students that the items may show up more than once in the video. For example, water bottles are shown for sale in the school cafeteria, but the video also shows that some students have water bottles on their desks in the classroom. After viewing the video, the instructor should discuss: \u0083 Where did you see the item? \u0083 What did it look like? \u0083 How was it used? \u0083 Are those items used in our school the same way? \u0083 What else was in t he picture with the item? \u0083 Do you have any questions about the item? This is not a test! The purpose is to assist student s in viewing the video with attention to detail, and to help them become familiar with da ily items found in American schools. For many items, the instructor will have to explain what an item is used for, and whether it would be used the same way in their schools. Since there are so many things to s ee in the video, and items can be easily missed, the instructor can show the video again, pointing out the items during the viewing. The video can also be stopped periodically so that the teacher can discuss a scene or a particular item.

Welcome to Our Schools 2. Good morning! 3. The buses are rolling in and it's time for school. 4. The bus drivers have a tight schedule so that everyone can get to school on time. 5. These students waited for their sc hool bus right near their homes and it brought them directly to school. 6. The students live in a town where the buses are provided free by the school district. The buses pick up everyone going to the elementary schools, the middle school and the high school. 7. If the students lived in a big city, they could take a subway or city bus to school. 8. Some students live close enough to t heir schools so that they can ride their bikes or walk to school with their friends. 9. Teachers greet the students and welcom e them to school in the morning. 10. In elementary school, the students go stra ight to their classroom, hang up their coats, load their backpacks into the storage cupboards (sometimes called \"cubbies\") and take out the homewor k that they finished the night before. 11. Some students do classroom jobs like passing out papers and watering the plants in the classroom. The t eacher answers questions from some students while others sign up for the school lunch. Do they want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Rice or sa lad? Will they order milk today? 12. In this classroom, if they brought a healthy snack like fruits and vegetables, they get to check off t heir names on the Carrot Club chart. Once the chart is full, the class will have a party with healthy foods. 13. Then it's time to get to work. Ever yone has a seat that the teacher chose for them. Every morning the students prac tice their writing skills. They all have worksheets to complete while the teacher writes on the board. Guide to the Videos 39 14. The students store in their desks the pencils, textbooks, notebooks, crayons, scissors, and glue that they may need during the school day. 15. They are quiet during th is writing lesson, but some times they work with the students sitting next to them. 16. After writing class, students who are learning how to speak English can go to a special class where the teacher will help them practice speaking and writing the English language. 17. Sometimes translators also join the class. 18. Today these students are learning how to describe things in English. When they started the English as a Second Language class, or ESL, they did not speak any English at all. 19. Now they can play a guessing game with the teacher and write words in English. 20. The ESL teacher will also help th em with their homework and will teach them about American schools. Some schools have Academic Coaches who can also help them with their English and answer questions about school. 21. Then it's back to class, walking qui etly in the hall, going past the student work from Art class, the rest rooms, the principal's office, and the bulletin board that says Welcome to Our School. 22. Back in the classroom, the students jo in in a Social Studies class. In Social Studies class in the elem entary school, students study about history, the economy, governments around t he world, and geography. 23. These students are learning about Ne w York State, and the teacher is showing them maps. Everyone gets t heir own copy of the map so that they can answer questions about New York State. 24. The students have to research thei r answers. There are many resources in the room for researching, includ ing maps on the wall, library books, and textbooks. This room also has co mputers, but in some schools the students use computers in the school library or in a computer lab. 25. The students can move around the room to look at the research materials, to help each other with their questions, and to talk over their ideas with the teacher. 26. Talking is allowed in this Social Studi es class. But, of course, the talking is done quietly, and everyone is concentrating on their schoolwork. Guide to the Videos 40 27. If the students do not under stand English, the ot her students and the teacher will help them. The students can also get help from the ESL teacher or a school tutor. A tutor is someone who will teach one or two students at a time, helping t hem with their schoolwork. 28. Once everyone has worked on thei r research, the teacher asks the students to return to their seats and put away their maps because it is time to work on their Science reports. 29. The class is studying animals of the world. 30. The class is interrupted by a bell. It is a fire drill. Everyone in the school is practicing leaving the school in case there is a fire. They line up outside the school so that the t eacher can take attendance. 31. When they are back in their cla ssroom, the teacher asks the students to take a book that is about animals out of their desk. They got the book at the school library, at the public librar y in the town, or from the classroom library. 32. They also need pencils, and they ta ke paper from their Science binder. 33. The teacher shows them how to organi ze their reports about animals. She writes on the chalkboard an out line that they can follow. 34. This is quiet class time, so student s listen to the teacher and raise their hands if they have a question. Once they have listened quietly to the teacher's directions, they can work with a partner if they want to. 35. Some students get permission from the teacher to go to the school library to do more research for t heir report, or to choose a book to borrow, or to sit and read quietly. 36. When they have chosen a book that they want to take home, they can check out the book with the school librarian. 37. Some students continue to research their Social Studies map questions or their Science reports, using t he computers in the library. 38.

Create a business card to distribute to classroo m teachers, administrators, guidance counselors, parents, and students. Find the offices of the school le aders and introduce yourself. Ask th em what problems they handle. For example, if a student repeatedly misses the bus in the morning, do you talk to the transportation supervisor? guidance counselor? teacher? Every school is different. Find out in advance because it will save you a lot of time. Some teachers do not understand t hat when Academic Coaches are interpreting they are representing the student or parent. Coaches may have to engage in a side conversation before explaining to the teacher what needs to be discu ssed. The Coach may have to ask the teacher a lot of questions before talking to the refugee. Take a few minutes to explain to teachers that an Academic Coach is not only interpreti ng but helping to solve a problem. (Note: Academic Coaches should clarify with the school distri ct whether they serve as an interpreter and/or advocate for refugee families.) Get to know the community beyond the school. Talk to the local religious leaders, YMCA, Boys/Girls Club, Art Centers, etc. to find out if they can provide services for refugee students. Community groups may need training on how to communicate with refugee families. They may be excellent guests at professional development meetings. Make sure that you know how th ings work in the school that y ou are assigned to. Ge t to know the Faculty Handbook, but ask how daily problems are normally handled. If a child misbehaves in class, what happens? If a student is bullied, what is the school's policy? If the student needs to see the school nurse, what is the procedure? Meet other students, not just refu gee students. Ask them what goes on in the school. Eventually you will see for yourself the impact of cell phones, conflicts betw een student groups, gang recruitment, and other issues that may not be visible to adults. The best way to protect your refugee students is to get to know what goes on behind the scenes. If you are an interpreter, talk to the teacher about what they would pr efer. You may have to sit in the back of the room, write things down for the student, gather handouts to review later, and refrain from translating instantly if t he student is working on speaking English in class. Remember that teen re fugees may be behind in schooling, but they are still teenagers and should be treated as older students. Tips from Academic Coaches 5 ACADEMIC COACH GOALS \u00d7 Assist the instructor in Informing refugee students about daily life in American schools. \u00d7 Support the instructor in creating a climate of comfort for refugee students in the Refugee Academy. \u00d7 Engage refugee students in activities that incorporate new knowledge, socialization, and support. \u00d7 Facilitate support and services for refugee students through positive relationships with school personnel, parents, and community-based organizations. The Welcome to Our Schools curriculum contains sixteen instructional modules, five Parent Programs, professional development programs, Mini-Academies, and Supplemental Primary Level (K\u20142) Activities. Academic Coaches, in conjunction with instructor s and other support personnel, should review the modules and select the materials that would be most relevant to the refugee students in the Refugee Academy. The modules can be used in any order, although it is advisable to introduce the curriculum with Module 1: American Schools and Module 2: Making Friends . The modules contain objectives, vocabulary words, classroom activities, journal topics, suggest ed follow-up activities, videos, and handouts. Academic Coaches assist instructor s in combining the contents of the modules with activities that have been used successfully in the past with refugee students. The instructional materials can be used with planned field trips, school tours, visiting speakers, and other supplemental activities. For many refugee students, all of the information will be new and bewildering. The key is to present the information so that students can observe, interact, and practice. Assisting the Refugee Academy Instructor 6 CURRICULUM Classroom management usually refers to st rategies that instructors use to ensure that students are pay ing attention and able to get their work done. This does not necessarily mean that t here must be complete silence in the classroom\u2014in fact, it can mean noisy, enthusiastic discussions\u2014but with strong classroom management the inst ructor is able to keep the group focused. But all it takes is one comment, one event, or one disruptive student to thro w off instruction. Sometimes it can take a while before the instru ctor can regain the att ention of the students. In the Refugee Academy, students w ho are unfamiliar with the basic ru les of classroom behavior may not hesitate to speak loudly , interrupt, and wander in (and so metimes out of) the classroom. Or the students may be so inti midated by the new classroom env ironment that t hey withdraw, hesitating to participate in class activities. The re sult is that other student s command the attention of the instructor and classr oom management is inequitable. Academic Coaches can assist the instructor by rein forcing the instructor's rules and keeping the students focused on the classroom activity. This should be done in an unobtrusive, sensitive manner. If students know the basic rules of t he Refugee Academy, they not only experience a better learning environmen t, they have the opportunity to practice how to behave in an American classroom. CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT \u00d7 Arrive on time. \u00d7 Find an available or assigned seat. \u00d7 Listen when an adult is speaking in front of the room. \u00d7 Listen when another student is speaking. \u00d7 Raise your hand to ask or answer a question. ACADEMY RULES 7 \u00d7 Remain in the seat unless inst ructed to move to another place \u00d7 Keep hands and feet in your own space \u00d7 Take good care of books and supplies \u00d7 Help to keep the classroom neat and organized Academic Coaches may have to assist refugee students in complying with these rules. It is difficult for any student to sit still at their desk and not talk to a neighbor. Refugee students who have not experi enced a school setting, or who have been educated in rigid, formal classrooms, may not be able to resist soci alizing. Academic Coaches can quietly help students return to the s eat and get back to work. Refugee students may not understand that sometimes students talk in groups and move around the classroom, while other times t hey are expected to sit quietly. Academic Coaches can follow the instructor's lead and use one or two key words such as \"quiet\" or \"talk\" to signal the differences. Some instructors may post pictures to indicate the type of activity t hat is occurring so that students have visual signals about how to behave. It has become common practice in American classroom s to instruct via small group discussions and projects. Students form pairs and team s to complete a task or plan a presentation. The instructor circulates, connecting briefly with each group. This may be an entirely new concept to refugee students who have been in school in their home country. Academic Coaches may have to help them learn how to participate effectively and comfortably in a small group activity. For many refugee students, school was definitely not a place to express an opinion. In some cases students (and perhaps their families) were punished if they did not adhere to the expected opinion. TRANSITIONS Instructors usually do not begin a new activity until desks are clear and stude nts are quiet. This transition time should eventually take one or two mi nutes, but will take much longer at first. The best thing the Academic Coaches can do is quietly direct attention towa rd the instructor. GROUP TIME EXPRESSING OPINIONS 8 In American classrooms, beginning at the elementary level, student s are encouraged to develop critical thinking skills. They are provided with opportunities to analyze ideas and express their personal points of view. Sometimes discussions c an be lively, but instru ctors generally welcome evidence of creative and thoughtful ideas. Although the modules in the Welcome to Our Schools curriculum focus primarily on facts about American schools, there are occasions for student s to share ideas and observations. Academic Coaches can assist refugee students in developing critical thinking skills by asking them to share their thoughts about the topics. It will be confusing for some students if they are used to repeating exactly what they have been told, but gradually the Academic Coaches can encourage and reinforce independent thinking. (Family and cultural traditions should always be respected.) It is important to recognize that some student s may be in a Refugee Academy with students from their home country. It cannot be a ssumed that they will naturally gr avitate to each other\u2014in fact, they may be enemies because of past friction related to ethnicity, religion, or other issues connected to life in their home country. Academic Coaches may not be able to gather specif ic information about the pa st experiences of students, but Coaches should be aware of the cult ural traditions of the different countries represented in the Academy. If the Academic Coach is aware of country histor y, ethnic tension, religious traditions, and other factor s that may create tension in the classroom, the instructor should be informed. As the Academy progresses, student s can be provided opportunities to develop positive relationships, so that they can move fo rward from old conflicts to new friendships. CULTURAL TENSION HANDLING SENSITIVE TOPICS 9 As refugee students become more comfortable in the Academy and begin to develop skills in the English language, they may start to share personal information. So me of the topics they mention may be very sensitive, whether the issues relate to past life experiences or experiences in their new lives in America. Academic Coaches will be in a position to hear comments and stories from refugee children that may be uncomfortable or even alarming. All personal comments, no matter how emotional, should be followed by some sort of acknowledgmen t by the Instructor or Academic Coach . This is necessary if the comment is shared in front of the entire class, or in confidence. If a student has revealed something personal in front of the entire group, the in structor or Academic Coach should not just move on to another topic, no matter how uncomfortable the students may be. The Academic Coach should defer to the instruct or who can acknowledge, offer support, and then move forward\u2014or stop the class and invite the support of other students. ALWAYS \u00d7 remember that the students are al l refugees, but they are still individual children \u00d7 help to set up activities so friendships can bloom \u00d7 praise, praise, praise 10 "}
