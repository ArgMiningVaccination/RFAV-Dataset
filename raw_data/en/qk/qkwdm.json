The earliest vaccinations started in the 7th century when snake venom was drank by Buddhists to try to gain immunity from snakebites. In 1796, Edward Jenner, a doctor in England, discovered he could give people immunity to smallpox by injecting them with material from cowpox lesions. Smallpox was a significant disease in most countries and killed millions of people in Europe and Mexico. Steps had already been taken to eradicate smallpox but it was Jenner who discovered using cowpox to immunize against smallpox as being the safest method. Using smallpox to create the vaccine was not safe so Jenner's idea helped to save many people. This was the beginning of developing vaccines to keep people safe from diseases that were capable of wiping out entire populations. This Vaccinations hold the keystone in the health society today. The vaccinations cure many diseases, which in turn saves many lives. Immunizations date back to the late 1700's to the vaccine's creation by Edward Jenner. (B) Ever since then immunizations stop infectious diseases and save lives. Vaccines serve as an important purpose in society and have many advantages; however, because they are so easily avoidable, something needs to change. Edward Jenner invented a vaccine by using a naturally-acquired and mild cowpox to prevent smallpox. More than one thousand people were vaccinated in England alone within three years. The print media played an important role in spreading the word about these vaccinations and smallpox was finally eradicated in 1980 (Bouldin, 2010). In the book, \"Survival of the Sickest\", Sharon Moalem forms the basis of how vaccine originated to become a way of combatting the most dangerous diseases in the world. It began with a discovery from a man named Edward Jenner, a doctor from Gloucestershire county in England, where he began to understand a strange pattern when people who were immune to cowpox were struggling with smallpox and vice-versa. He started to test his findings through a small experiment where he injected cow pox into a group of young children and he was surprised to see that their bodies built immunity towards smallpox and supported his findings on the bizarre immunity of people towards either the smallpox or the cowpox but not to both. The rest of the chapter explains complex concepts Mandatory vaccination continues to be a contentious subject in the United States, even though extensive evidence proves inoculation prevents certain diseases. According to A. Plotkin & L. Plotkin (2011), the evolution of the first vaccine commenced in the 1700's when a physician named Edwards Jenner discovered that cowpox protected Jenner's discovery of the link between cowpox and smallpox was significant to the development of a vaccine for smallpox. However, it can be argued that Jenner and his discovery were not enough on their own to bring medical progress. The factors Scientific thinking, Government Communication and Changing attitudes played a major and important role to bring medical progress. This is not to say that the conflict between the anti-vaccine movement (once again more of a set of ideologies) and the state mandated vaccinations did not cease. The 1922 case of Zucht v. King saw the expansion of compulsory vaccination to schoolchildren attending public school (a distinction that would come to the fore later in the 20th century (Colgrove & Bayer, 2005). Even as education took the front seat, public health still held the tools of quarantine According to my research, in 1796 Dr. Edward Jenner developed a vaccine for smallpox disease however during this time only cows were infected. This vaccine came from the cowpox virus. In 1809, the state of Massachusetts became the first to mandate the smallpox vaccinations then in 1879 a group of Anti-Vaccination of America was formed and their belief is that no one should be forced to vaccination. They believed that the vaccine was spreading the disease instead of preventing it. In 1986 Due to lack of funds, George Washington managed to lead his troops to survive the harsh conditions of the Valley Forge winter. Afterwards, they experienced their second obstacle: small pox. Small pox is a European disease, and since the colonists have been isolated from this illness for nearly two centuries (chapter 3, slides), they did not have the immune system to overcome it. George Washington took a gamble and decided to expose the healthy soldiers with the small pox virus, modern day known as vaccination. His gamble paid off, losing only 1 in 50 soldiers to small pox rather than losing a few thousands The issue regarding vaccinations and their accompanying side effects has been a prevalent debate throughout society and medicine for a number of years. Some continue to believe that vaccinations are harmful and actually promote disease, but the truth is that the concept of immunization is one of the most Throughout history, smallpox has been one of the dreaded scourges that inflicted mankind. World Health Organization (WHO) stated that smallpox is responsible for the 300 million death cases worldwide in the twentieth century. (Fenner, Henderson, Arita, Jezek , & Ladnyi, 1988) (Plotkin, 2004) It was only after Dr Edward Jenner's Vaccination Research In colonial America in the 1700's the smallpox virus was spreading throughout the population, and killing as many of half of the people who were contracting the virus. According to pbs.org the earliest form of vaccinations was called \"inoculation\" and was being debated if it was considered safe. The fear was understandable, because the process to inoculate against the smallpox was riskier than todays modern vaccine. In the 1700's inoculating statistics proved that it helped reduce the number of deaths. Inoculating took weeks and in the 1700's George Washington did not have many soldiers to spare if one contracted small pox. Today, may historians credit inoculating with helping the Continental Army win the Today most children in the United States live a much healthier life and parents live with much less anxiety due to vaccinations. More than 200 years ago, Edward Jenner conducted an experiment that would be one of the most astounding breakthroughs in medical history. Jenner noticed that milkmaids didn't catch the smallpox, a disease rampant across the English countryside. He reasoned that the blisters on the milkmaid's hand must contain something that was protective. He tested his theory by taking fluid from a blister on the wrist of a milkmaid and inoculating it into the arm of a local laborer's son (Offit and \"There is today something that parents can do to make sure that this sort of tragedy does not happen to a child of theirs. They can insist that their child is immunized against measles. I was unable to that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable measles vaccine had not been discovered. Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it' (Roald Dahl). Edward Jenner, an english doctor, the father of immunology and pioneer of the smallpox vaccination was born in Berkeley, Gloucestershire. At the age of 14, Edward was apprenticed to a local surgeon and trained in London. Early in 1772 he went back to Berkeley and spent his time as a doctor in his native town. Several Edward Jenner and the Discovery of Vaccines Edward Jenner (1749-1823) trained in London, under John Hunter, and was an army surgeon for a period of time. After that, he spent his whole career as a country doctor in his home "}
