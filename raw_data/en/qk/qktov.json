JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING VOL. 9, No. 1 A proposal to create a system that combines the power of two biomedical imaging technologies to produce more detailed, near-live images of brain activity has earned Fischell Department of Bioengineering (BioE) assistant professor Yu Chen a 5-year, $400,000 National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (NSF CAREER) Award. Chen specializes in the advancement of optical coherence tomography (OCT), a micron-scale imaging technology that allows doctors to examine changes to tissues in the body and in real time, without the need for a biopsy to acquire a sample. OCT is similar in concept to ultrasound, but creates images by measuring the echo time delay and intensity of back-reflected light rather than sound. Chen's award-winning project, \"Multi- Scale of Neural Interconnects Parallel Photonic Needle Interface,\" will apply his group's innovations to the design of a new system capable of observing neural activ-ity in the brain. The sys- tem, which will use OCT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in par- allel, is expected to improve our understand- ing of fast neuronal activation and the slower changes in blood flow that occur in response. \"Functional MRI is particularly useful for visualizing the location of neural activity, but has limited spatial resolution and temporal response\u2014about one millimeter and one second, respectively,\" explains Chen. \"Optical techniques such as OCT offer high spatial and temporal resolutions\u2014about one to ten microns and one to ten milliseconds, respectively. A system that combines and correlates large field-of-view MRI and high-resolution optical imaging can enhance our understanding of brain function and improve the accuracy of image-guided neurosurgery.\" The new system is based in part on the Needle OCT/Doppler (DOCT) probe, a long, slender bioimaging device Chen's Biophotonic Imaging Laboratory designed for neurosurgeons. The needle imaging probe, which measures less than 1mm in outside diameter, is capable of accompanying surgical tools into the brain inside a tube called a cannula, looking ahead and interpreting the biological landscape for the surgeon, who can then make course corrections that avoid damaging blood vessels while en route to a tumor or injury. Chen is excited about the project's potential. \"The MRI/parallel optical imaging platform will enable multi-scale imaging of neural structure and function deep within the living brain for the first time,\" he says. \"It has the potential to link the microscopic IN THIS ISSUE: 2 RESEARCH NEWS 4 FACULTY NEWS 7 ENTREPRENEURSHIP 9 STUDENT NEWS 13 RECENT DISSERTATIONS 14 ALUMNI NEWS 15 CHAIR'S MESSAGE 15 M-CERSI UPDATEChen Bioimaging Research Wins Prestigious NSF CAREER Award YU CHEN continues pg. 2BIOFEEDBACK v ol. 9 no. 1 2Bioscience Research & Technology Review Day is a special event that features research talks, presentations, mini-symposia and demonstrations by university scientists.

FASTER, EASIER W AY TO DIAGNOSE METABOLIC DISORDERS IN INFANTS A proposal to create an inexpensive sen-sor for the rapid, point-of-care diagnosis of metabolic disorders in infants has earned BioE professor and associate dean Peter Kofinas the Clark School's first T ranslational Sciences Grant from the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Advancing T ranslational Sciences. The project, conducted in collaboration with the Children's National Medical Center, will develop a system capable of detecting diseases such as hyperammonemia (a urea cycle disorder resulting in excess ammonia in the body) and phenylketonuria (an inability to metabolize an enzyme found in many foods) based on the analysis of a blood sample. Left untreated, hyperammonemia and phenylketonuria can lead to a lack of cognitive development, behavioral and neurological problems, seizures, encephalopathy, and even death. Early diagnosis and management of these diseases are critical for a child to develop normally and remain healthy in adulthood, but afflicted babies may not express obvious symptoms until they are several months old. Kofinas' goal is to make screening for these metabolic disorders easy and cost-effective enough to perform in any doctor's office, well before the conditions advance to the point of doing substantial harm. \"Our sensor device will be based on inexpensive components that require minimal training to operate,\" he says, \"leading to reduced health care costs for the patient and the prevention of complications that impair mental health.\"neurovascular functions discovered in animal models with the macroscopic signals relevant for human imaging, thereby enabling translation of basic biomedical research insights to clinical applications.\" The NSF CAREER program supports the career development of outstanding junior faculty who most effectively integrate research and education within the goals and missions of their programs, departments, and schools. Chen is the fifth BioE assistant professor since the department's launch in 2006 to receive a CAREER Award, preceded by Ian White in 2012, Joonil Seog (now with the Department of Materials Science and Engineering) in 2011, Adam Hsieh in 2009, and Helim Aranda-Espinoza in 2007. NEW MICROFLUIDIC DEVICE C OULD SPEED DRUG EVALUATION A poster presented by BioE graduate student Mariana Meyer won the Bioengineering division at the university's Bioscience Research & Technology Review Day. Meyer's poster, \"Multi-Depth Microfluidic Biofilm Reactor Fabricated With ALD Passivaton of a Photoresist Mold,\" described the design of a microfluidic device in which bacterial biofilms\u2014a collection of cells that adhere to each other across a surface\u2014can be studied. The device is capable of separating the film into isolated sections, allowing researchers to simultaneously perform multiple tests on the same sample. Meyer's device uses channels with varying depths to accommodate both the biofilms and the tiny pneumatic valves used to separate them. She developed a new technique to create the different levels by alternating layers of photopatterned polymer with thin layers of aluminum oxide within her device mold. The aluminum oxide protects the polymer layer below as a new one is fabricated above. Her ultimate goal, she says, is to use the device to examine how biofilms respond to new antibacterial treatments being developed in response to the growing number of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. \"This platform would help streamline the drug evaluation process,\" she explains. \"Its small size means that you do not need large samples of new drugs for evaluating efficacy, and the ability to perform multiple [tests] on one biofilm allows for gathering more information more quickly.\" Meyer says what she enjoys most about the project is how it requires her to use knowledge and skills from a number of dis-ciplines\u2014including microbiology, electrical engineering, bioengineering, and materials science\u2014to produce an effective device. \"I am constantly discovering different aspects to the project and [have] the opportunity to work [on it] with students and experts in a variety of fields,\" she says. Meyer, who conducts her research at the MEMS Sensors and Actuators Laboratory, is advised by Institute for Systems Research (ISR) director and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering professor Reza Ghodssi. Her work is funded by the Robert W. Deutsch Foundation. In addition to Ghodssi, Meyer's co-authors on the poster are ISR graduate students Young Wook Kim, Hadar Ben- Yoav, and Markus Gnerlich; and BioE professor and chair William E.

The Seog Group was the first to discover that the AFM's tapping action not only stimulated the formation of SELP fibers, but could also be used to direct them into specific patterns or shapes perpendicular to the microscope's scanning direction. While it has not yet been firmly established why interaction with the AFM's cantilever has this effect on SELP\u2014that's the subject of the group's next study\u2014Johnson's recent paper outlines the scanning conditions that optimize the fibers' growth, the relationship between scanning speed and growth rate, and what is known about the growth mechanism to date. The three things that affect SELP assembly and direction, Johnson explains, are the AFM's scanning speed, cantilever tip pressure, and how many times the tip is scanned across the width of the sample, a variable known as line density. Johnson and her colleagues found that while using the AFM in tapping mode, lower scanning speeds, higher pressure, and increased line density (particularly once each line equals the width of a SELP molecule) resulted in the fastest and most directed growth. They also discovered that a SELP molecule on a mica subsrate must be tapped multiple times to stimulate nucleation, the process that causes the nanofibers to grow. The creation of the miniature letters \"UMD,\" says Johnson, was \"the conglomeration of the best conditions [the team] found.\" Going forward, the Seog Group hopes to understand the nucleation mechanism that occurs at the cantilever's tip, both why it happens and why the SELP fibers grow in the specific direction they do. Once that knowledge has been perfected, Johnson adds, she and her colleagues can begin to explore practical biomedical applications of structures made out of SELP. Johnson says working on the project over the past two years and publishing her first paper have been fulfilling, and have inspired her to continue her education. \"Coming into the undergraduate program, I didn't have any intent of going on to graduate school,\" she says. \"I just wanted to get out there and make medical devices. Working with grad students and postdocs really allowed me to see that I could obtain [their] level of knowledge. Learning more about the research process can be very challenging, but you also have those exciting moments where you discover something new...and it's pretty rewarding!\" For Cappello, Solares and Joonil Seog.

TAO: FELLOW OF AMERICAN SOCIETY OF A GRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERS BioE extends its congratulations to Professor Yang Tao, who was elected to Fellowship in the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE). Tao was cited for his nationally and internationally recognized expertise \"in cutting-edge research programs, [for] achievements in the applications of machine vision and bio-imaging, [for] developing innovative and practical high-tech systems and technologies for food safety and quality, and for cost-effective production of poultry, fruit, vegetables, and other products.\" After earning his Ph.D. from Penn State in 1991, Tao served as the Vice President and Director of R&D of AGRI-TECH, Inc., where he led the development of machine vision, non-invasive inspection, packing, and optical-electronic and robotic sorting systems. These included the award-winning Merlin\u00ae color vision sorting system, capable of handling and grading up to 44 tons of fruits or vegetables per hour. He was a member of the engineering faculty of the University of Arkansas from 1996-2000. In 2000, he joined the University of Maryland's Department of Biological Resources Engineering, and in 2006 was appointed to the faculty of the newly created Fischell Department of Bioengineering. Tao's current research projects include the development of a new system for de-capping up to 120 strawberries per second while increasing worker and product safety, and a hyperspectral imaging system used to help separate the meat of the North American black walnut\u2014a more difficult nut to crack than the familiar English walnut\u2014from its shell. Outside of the lab, Tao leads the BioE's two-semester, senior year Capstone course, in which teams of students design and construct a prototype medical device designed to address a real-world problem. In addition to teaching students about the invention process, market research and patent procedures, Tao coordinates matching each team with both a faculty advisor and an external mentor from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, a regional hospital, or a biotech company. He also teaches the department's medical instrumentation course.

The book's goal is to bridge a gap between current research and clinical application, and to make biosensor technology\u2014which is poised to provide faster screening and earlier diagnoses\u2014more accessible to oncologists, pathologists, engineers and molecular biologists.The book covers major areas of biosen- sor technology and functionality, including optical technologies (such as surface plasmon resonance, evanescent wave, spectrometry, fluorescence, and photoacoustic), electro-chemical detection, and magnetic technologies, thermoelectric sensing, and cantilever-based technologies. CHEN'S BIOMEDICAL IMAGING FEATURED IN AMERICAN CENTER FOR PHYSICS ART EXHIBIT The delicate microanatomy of brains and kidneys, captured in rich color and detail using techniques found in the laboratory rather than an artist's studio, are simultaneously technology and art, literal slices of life and abstractions. The images, produced by BioE assistant professor Yu Chen with visiting research assistant professor Hengchang Guo and Burke Rehabilitation Center assistant professor Jian Zhong, were presented alongside sculptures and paintings inspired by science in a show called From Here to Infinity, which ran from October 2012 until April 2013. T wice annually, the ACP hosts shows that explore the relationship between science and art by exhibiting paintings, sculpture, photography, prints, or drawings inspired by technology, math, medicine, or other technological trends. After attending a previous exhibit focusing on natural phenomena, Chen approached curator Sarah Tanguy with an idea for a biomedical imaging- themed show, and found she shared his interests. \"Biomedical imaging is grounded in physics, and is a more sophisticated way of producing 'photography,'\" says Chen. \"I have always been fascinated by the images produced by my research, and teaching people about them, so I thought it might be a good way to present some biomedical images and attract interest from the general public.\"In From Here to Infinity, Tanguy combined Chen's biomedical imaging with sculptures by former research chemist Susan Van der Eb Greene and cell-staining-inspired paintings by Jeffrey Kenwhose to present a body of work that \"...[sought] to harness energy and exploit the dynamic relationship between abstraction and representation\" and that \"suggest[ed] movement, real or imagined, exploring transition over time and immortality within change.\" Chen, Greene and Kent, Tanguy suggested in the exhibit's brochure, \"...share a thrill of discovery and a quest to channel energy [by] probing the structural beauty hidden in plain sight.\" These descriptions seem particularly applicable to Chen's work with optical coherence and two-photon microscopy (TPM), which enables him to catch living tissue just below the skin in the act of transitioning to or from a disease state, without having to remove it from the patient's body. In addition to OCT, FCM, and TPM, Chen and his colleagues produced their contributions to the exhibit with technologies including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electron microscopy. BioE associate professor Silvia Muro, Maryland Neuroimaging Center magnetic resonance physicist Wang Zhan, and University of Maryland School of Medicine associate professor Rao Gullapalli also contributed their images for the exhibit, which reflected biological structures ranging from organelles to cells and organs.faculty NEWS continued ASSISTANT PROFESSOR YU CHEN WITH ONE OF HIS PIECES AT THE AMERICAN CENTER FOR PHYSICS GALLERY .

Reproduced with permission from E@M, 12(2):20, Fall 2012. It's a winning combination: teams of talented Clark School bioengineering students working closely with physician-mentors from one of the nation's leading healthcare institutions to solve pressing medical problems. A partnership between the Clark School's Fischell Department of Bioengineering and the University of Maryland School of Medicine is pairing undergraduates with physicians in a two-semester Senior Capstone Design course in which students must create innovative engineering solutions to problems that impact patient care. The partnership is yielding impressive results. Mentored by Jeffrey Hasday, M.D., professor of medicine and the head of pulmonary and critical care at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, five bioengineering students have created a patent-pending device to deliver drugs to patients with respiratory failure, the third leading cause of death in the United States. Their invention led to the launch of Wesk Medical, LLC, a start-up company specializing in medical device development. \"Bioengineering and medicine are so intricately and inexorably tied together that it makes for a natural collaboration,\" says team member Kaiyi Xie (B.S. '12). \"Through the partnership, we were able to identify a real medical problem and take off from there.\" Aerosol Catheter to Improve Patient Care Drawing on his 26 years of critical care experience, Hasday helped the students identify the need: Patients experiencing respiratory failure are often intubated\u2014an endotracheal tube is placed through their mouth or nose, bringing them entre PRENEURSHIP oxygen from a respirator. When those patients require inhaled medications, the endotracheal tube poses physical obstacles, making drug delivery to the lungs inadequate and unpredictable. \"Academic studies show that only one to four percent of drugs reach patients' lungs, and we are not sure how much is absorbed,\" says Xie. With Hasday's guidance, the students developed a solution: the endotracheal aerosol-generating catheter (ETAG). The tiny catheter\u2014only a couple millimeters wide\u2014is threaded down the endotracheal tube, delivering droplets of liquid drugs to a microchip at the innermost tip of the tube. The chip uses surface acoustic waves to vibrate the droplet, nebulizing it into consistently and optimally sized aerosol particles for delivery to patients' lungs. The students also are collaborating with University of Maryland School of Pharmacy Professor and Associate Dean Richard Dalby , whose lab specializes in evaluating aerosol-based drug delivery systems. \"There is real value in these types of collaborations,\" says Dalby. \"The engineers bring the ability to design devices, while the medical school and pharmacy school bring a sensitivity to patient-use issues.\" Hinman and Citrin Programs Help Students Hasday, a member of Wesk Medical's management team, describes the start-up as \"the perfect example of bioengineers creating and implementing ideas with clinical solutions. As we move through the product development phase, our long-term goal for this product and others is to reach the marketplace and improve the quality of care for patients.\" The team relied heavily on the entrepreneurial experience of members Esmaeel Paryavi and Bernard Wong (both B.S. '12), who were enrolled in the Hinman CEOs program, the nation's first living/ learning entrepreneurship program. The program, which is part of the Clark School's Maryland Technology Enterprise SOLID POLYMER ELECTROLYTE : LITHIUM FLEX IS NEARLY TRANSPARENT , FLEXIBLE, CAN BE MOLDED INTO ANY SHAPE, AND IS NOT FLAMMABLE OR CORROSIVE.

To strip the whole presentation of any and all science was difficult, but that did allow us to focus on exactly what they were looking for: the business.\" Virgile says his and Hoppmann's experiences in Pitch Dingman and other business plan competitions have been inspiring and beneficial as they've moved forward with product development. \"Not only have they provided valuable funding, more importantly, they provided validation,\" he says. \"It's a common belief that entrepreneurship is extremely risky. But if you perform the technical and market research, talk to potential customers, and find your minimum viable product, before you invest all of your time and money into your business, then the risk is dramatically reduced...The competitions have shown us that we did do all of our homework, and that this is a worthwhile project, and a needed product.\"DIAGNOSTIC ANSERS PITCHES DINGMAN...AND WINS! What if a sensor capable of detecting the smallest traces of pesticides, explosives, drugs and toxins in food and water could be manufactured anywhere using a modified inkjet printer, for a fraction of the cost of the currently available technology? That question, posed and answered by Clark School startup company Diagnostic anSERS, won October's Pitch Dingman competition. Administered by the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship at the Robert H. Smith School of Business, the Pitch Dingman competition gives students from any major six minutes to convince a panel of Entrepreneurs-in-Residence that their idea is worth funding with the $2500 prize. Prior to the competition, participants attend informal presentation ses-sions to learn how to craft a pitch, practice their presentations, and receive feedback. The Dingman Center runs two competitions each semester. Diagnostic anSERS, founded by BioE graduate students Eric Hoppmann and Sean Virgile (both advised by BioE assistant professor Ian White), uses a novel ink jet printing process to fabricate inexpensive substrates for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), a molecular fingerprinting technique. The result is a low-cost, on-demand, and portable version of an advanced sensor technology that is typically a high-end investment and confined to a lab. Virgile says Pitch Dingman presented a new challenge for him and Hoppmann despite their previous experience. \"[The pitch] is evaluated solely on busi- ness [merit], not science,\" he explains. \"This makes it incredibly hard. We're used to talking SafeLiCell's product, Lithium Flex, is a light, strong film that can be wrapped or bent into different shapes without breaking, and, unlike current lithium-ion battery electrolytes, contains no combustible or corrosive materials. By the time the team received their invitations to the ACS's Green Chemistry & Engineering Conference, where the final round of the competition took place, Kofinas and Fisher were scheduled to attend conferences in Korea. They encouraged Khalid to take reins. \"I was very excited to have an opportunity to present SafeLiCell's business plan on my own,\" says Khalid, \"[but] it was definitely a bit unnerving to compete with full-time professionals in the field.\" Although he felt confident he had delivered a solid presentation and successfully fielded questions from the judges, he admits he was \"stunned\" to learn he'd earned the $10,00 second prize. \"I am very grateful to have had a chance to present at the conference and to have won the confidence of the judges and the audience,\" he says, adding that his participation in the competition was an \"invaluable experience.\" \"Mian was the youngest person in the competition by far,\" says Kofinas. \"He's a great example of the caliber of our undergraduates, who have demonstrated they can compete and win in events held at professional and national levels. I am very proud of him.\" The Green Chemistry Institute award is SafeLiCell's second significant win. In April 2012, the company took second place in and received a $15,000 prize at the inaugural $100K ACC Clean Energy Challenge business plan competition. Khalid's work in Kofinas's Functional Macromolecular Laboratory is funded by an Undergraduate Research Fellowship from Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He also majors in English and is a member of the Clark School's Engineering Honors Program and the College Park Scholars' Global Public Health program. entre PRENEURSHIP continued SEAN VIRGILE & ERIC HOPPMANN BIOE GRADUATE STUDENT RASA GHAFFARIAN'S ILLUSTRATION APPEARED ON THE COVER OF THE Journal of controllEd rElEasE. IT SHOWS ANTI-ICAM NANOCARRIERS BEING TRANSPORTED ACROSS CACO-2 CELL MONOLAYERS VIA TRANSCYTOSIS PATHWAY RELATED PARACELLULAR from page 79DRUG DELIVERY S YSTEM WINS PROFESSOR VENTURE F AIR A pair of researchers from the Fischell Department of Bioengineering were honored at the University of Maryland's 2012 Bioscience Research & Technology Review Day for their presentation of a novel drug delivery strategy that uses targeted carriers capable of crossing the gastrointestinal (GI) tract into the circulation. Associate Professor Silvia Muro (joint, BioE and Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research) and her advisee, graduate student Rasa Ghaffarian, won first place in the annual event's Professor Venture Fair. Hosted by the Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute, the university's Office of Technology Commercialization, and the College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences, the annual Professor Venture Fair gives faculty inventors the opportunity to pitch their new technologies to a team of regional venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. The competition encourages scientists to consider the commercial viability of their work and challenges them to translate their ideas into a presentation for a general, non-technical audience. The pair's innovative solution uses the GI tract's built-in transportation system, the transepithelial pathway, to move orally administered therapeutic or diagnostic molecules into the bloodstream. Although oral administration of drugs and therapeutics is preferred due to its simplicity, low cost, comfort, and higher level of patient compliance, in many cases, only a fraction of the dose swallowed ever reaches its target due to the harsh environment of the digestive system. Some biological treatments, such as vaccines or antitoxins, cannot currently be administered orally at all. Drugs can be \"pushed through\" junctions between the epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but this may result in side effects if other substances cross the junctions when they are opened. Muro and Ghaffarian created a delivery system in which drugs are loaded in nanocarrier particles that are targeted to cell surface receptors that control natural transport SILVIA MURO (LEFT) AND RASA GHAFFARIAN (RIGHT)across the GI epithelial cells. Using the cells' natural behavior to do the work results in a safe, fast and efficient passage into the circulation without \"using force\" or negatively affecting GI permeability. \"This is a culmination of years of effort in what we believe to be a very important contribution to the scientific community,\" says Ghaffarian. \"Our research addresses a practical need to transport macromolecular therapeutics.\" \"It holds great potential as a general platform for gastrointestinal delivery into the circulation and for the treatment of gastrointestinal epithelial cells involved in infections, inflammatory conditions, and cancer,\" Muro adds. \"There is no doubt that this discovery will be able to enhance oral biological therapies as well as the safe targeting of drug delivery carriers.\" The system also holds promise for other applications, including the oral delivery of therapeutics for lysosomal storage disorders and for Alzheimer's disease, small molecular drugs for the treatment of genetic conditions, and treatments against inflammation, thrombosis and oxidative stress. In addition to the win at the Professor Venture Fair, a paper on the delivery system was featured on the cover of the Journal of Controlled Release, one of the top publications focusing on drug and gene delivery, tissue engineering, and related diagnostics. The research also won the American Society of Nanomedicine's Best Poster Award in 2011. Muro and Ghaffarian's team is the third led by or including members of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering that has taken first place in the Professor Venture Fair competition. In 2009, Professor John Fisher won for his presentation of a bioreactor used to help generate new bone tissue for patients with serious injuries; and in 2008, former Fischell Fellow Matthew Dowling was part of team that won for its presentation of Velcro-like \"biobandages\" capable of clotting blood and administering drugs.student NEWS FERLIN ELECTED COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY BioE graduate student Kimberly Ferlin, co-advised by Professor John Fisher (BioE) and Dr. David Kaplan (FDA), was elected to a three-year term as the communications Officer for the Americas Branch of the Student and Young Investigator Section of TERMIS, the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society (TERMIS SYIS-AM).

Each academic year, scholars and their mentors are recognized in a special ceremony, and teachers and faculty participate in a workshop designed to strengthen relationships between the university and K-12 schools. To continue the legacy of academic excellence and mentoring, scholarships are awarded in the K-12 mentors' names to new first year students from their respective high schools or school districts. This year, two BioE undergraduates were among the 2012 Merrill Presidential Scholars: Joshua Thompson was chosen for his excellence in scholarship; research achievements in projects focusing on stem cells, biomaterials, and tissue engineering, including publishing in peer-reviewed journals and presenting at professional societies; and commitment to volunteering in local and international hospitals. He is also a teaching assistant for the Department of Chemistry, a Maryland Images Campus Tour Guide, an Eagle Scout, and the 2011 winner of the Outstanding ASPIRE Student Research Award. Thompson's mentors are BioE professor John Fisher and Loyola High School chemistry teacher Lakeisha O'Keiffe. Janina Vaitkus was chosen for her excellence in academics in bioengineering and honors curricula, leadership in research on neuronal cell structure and function, volunteerism including bilingual assistance in clinics, commitment to teaching, and leadership in club athletics. She is a former member of the campus' student government association, an undergraduate researcher and teaching fellow, a volunteer at Shanahan Children's Clinic, and has worked in a local emergency department. Outside of class, she plays on the school's club lacrosse team, where she has been co-captain for the past two years. She will be studying abroad in Guatemala while running sports clinics for the children in the area, and after graduation, she will be entering the University of Maryland School of Medicine to earn dual M.D./Ph.D. degrees and pursue her goal of becoming a physician-scientist. Vaitkus' mentors are BioE professor Helim Aranda-Espinoza and South River High School assistant principal Ryan Sackett. UMD AND JHU S TUDENTS JOIN FORCES FOR RESEARCH D AY Undergraduates from the Clark School's Fischell Department of Bioengineering (UMD BioE) and Johns Hopkins University's Department of Biomedical Engineering (JHU BME) recently participated in a new annual event designed to showcase the impact and quality of undergraduate research, and to encourage classmates to pursue their own laboratory experiences. \"Amplifying the Field: Undergraduate Contributions to Biomedical Research,\" held March 1 on the JHU Homewood campus in Baltimore, was conceived by the two universities' student chapters of the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES). Chapter presidents John Kim (JHU BME) and David Peeler (UMD BioE) hosted the event, which included guest speakers from BMES and both schools' faculties, a poster session, dinner, and an awards ceremony. Speakers included BMES' Isabel Regena Borkoski, who discussed the benefits of becoming involved with a professional society, whether one planned for a future in research or industry; and professors Jordan Green (JHU BME) and Ian White (UMD BioE), both of whom stressed that in both the job market and graduate school applications, \"undergraduate research trumps straight As.\" When you participate in undergraduate research, White told the audience, \"you learn to think like a researcher, gain confidence, interpret information, and relate what you've learned to other things. Those benefits apply to many future career paths.\" About two dozen posters were exhibited, and six authors among those who submitted were selected to deliver oral presentations. A team of faculty judges representing both schools gave awards to the top three presentations, while students voted for the best poster. The winners, who received certificates and cash prizes, were: Mary Natoli (UMD BioE), who took 1st Place for her oral presentation, \"Point of Care Diagnostics for Aminoacidopathies in Infants;\" Hyun Sung Park (JHU BME), who took 2nd place for his oral presentation, \"Formation of Neuromuscular Junction in a Microfluidic Device;\" Jeff Rappaport (UMD BioE), who took 3rd Place for his oral presentation, \"Characterizing the Uptake of Targeted Nanocarriers for Drug Delivery Across the Blood/Brain Best Poster Award for \"Toward Real-Time Decoding from Directed Functional Connectivity of the Electrocorticogram\" and \"Characteristics of Polyurethane vs. Natural Rubber Latex Condoms in the Presence of Primary Ingredients in Commercial Personal Lubricants,\" respectively.

BIOE PROFESSOR SILVIA MURO (LEFT) DISCUSSING RESEARCH WITH A STUDENT AT THE JHU/UMD POSTER SESSION.CHOI NAMED 2012-2013 FISCHELL FELLOW the fischell department of bioengineering is pleased to announce Mina Choi as the recipient of the 2012-2013 fischell fellowship in biomedical engineering. the annual award supports talented and innovative graduate students interested in applied research and product design in the biomedical industry. fischell fellows are among the clark school's best and brightest students, who not only exemplify outstanding academic achievement, but also department namesake dr. Robert E. Fischell's (m.s. '53, physics) entrepreneurial spirit and drive to put life-changing technology into the hands of clinicians and patients around the world. previous fischell fellows have gone on to patent and license their inventions, launch companies, and work for venture capital firms. \"when i first heard of bioengineering, i did not have the slightest clue what it entailed,\" choi admits. \"i chose [it] because i like a good challenge and was attracted to the idea of job security upon graduation... but upon completion of more specialized biomedical courses i began to appreciate how various sciences and mathematics fit together. i learned that the importance of biomedical engineering is to bring together these otherwise isolated subjects to solve practical problems in medicine.\" choi earned her b.s. in biomedical engineering and her m.s. in electrical engineering from the george washington university ( gwu). her previous research experience includes a project that visualized the effects of violent computer games on the brain using eeg at iowa state university; the design of a neonatal seizure detection algorithm in collaboration with neurologist dr. Taeun Chang at the children's national medical center; modeling traumatic brain injury using high intensity focused ultrasound under the guidance of dr. Vesna zderic (gwu) and dr. Matthew Myers (u .s. food and drug Administration [fd A]); and her master's thesis under dr. Aldo Badano (fd A), measuring veiling glare in high-dynamic-range displays and in the human eye. After completing her m.s., she continued her work with badano as an orise fellow for two years before returning to graduate school. choi chose the clark school and the fischell department of bioengineering for their strong reputations and location near biomedical companies and government agencies. \"umd has had a long-standing research relationship with the fdA, and i was attracted to the idea that i could continue my current work [there] while networking for future opportunities...i was impressed by the research collaborations the school has with various companies. this potential to apply my studies and research to real-life applications was particularly appealing, and i believe umd will prepare me to succeed in a rapidly growing and competitive field.\" At the clark school, mina is interested in pursuing research in medical imaging and simulations. After earning her ph.d ., she would like to spend time in industry and try to launch her own company before returning to academia. outside of the lab, she enjoys playing guitar, gaming, hiking and travel. her past trips include missions to assist dentists in gambia and to farm and teach in kyrgyzstan.

He joined BioE professor Peter Kofinas' research group during his freshman year and quickly became a valuable member of Kofinas' Functional Macromolecular Laboratory, co-authoring three published papers and co-founding SafeLiCell, a startup company developing a solid-state polymer battery electrolyte called LithiumFlex. His work on the product has earned him a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Undergraduate Research Fellowship, and SafeLiCell $25,000 in business plan competition prizes from the Atlantic Coast Conference and the American Chemical Society (see related story, p. 7). Outside of the lab, Khalid volunteers at the Muslim Community Medical Center in Silver Spring, Md. and serves as a Clark School Ambassador. \"College Park Scholars [was] a big part of the first two years of my undergraduate life,\" says Khalid. \"I made friends, met professors who would become wonderful mentors, and learned the value of being involved in meaningful service for my community...Scholars has helped me think outside the box when it comes to applying concepts and being open minded in my engineering and English classes...[and] relat[ing] my research to a business idea in real terms. I want to thank Scholars for honoring me with such a prestigious award and I hope to maintain the vision of the [College Park Scholars] Founders' Circle by translating this into my successful dream career.\" HSU WINS BIOE OUTSTANDING GRADUATE RESEARCH A WARD BioE graduate student Janet Hsu, advised by BioE and Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research associate professor Silvia Muro, received the department's 2012-2013 Outstanding Graduate Research Award for her dissertation work to date on a targeted drug delivery system capable of crossing the blood/brain barrier to treat Niemann-Pick Disease Type A, a rare, fatal lysosomal storage disorder. Since joining the department in 2008, Hsu has been the first author of four peer reviewed publications and the co-author of a fifth, as well as delivered numerous oral and poster presentations around the country. BIOENGINEERING SENIORS LEARN ABOUT P ATENT PROCESSES BioE seniors recently learned more about how patents are submitted, reviewed, approved or rejected, and disputed on a field trip to U.S. Court of Appeals for Federal Circuits. The visit was organized by Professor Yang Tao, and hosted by Judge Pauline Newman and her aides. The seniors were members of the two- semester Capstone Design course, in which teams of students utilize what they have learned throughout their undergraduate studies to conceptualize and develop a prototype biomedical device or process. In the fall semester, while developing their project plans, students also study entrepreneurship, ethics, regulatory issues, and intellectual property. Learning about the patent process has become increasingly important as more teams file for provisional patents on their Capstone inventions by the end of their senior year. Judge Newman, her aides and her clerks explained how patent-related litigation ends up in court, and the judicial process applied to disputes, by breaking down the cases the students observed. She also explained her own role in what can be a complicated decision-making process. Newman and her staff estimated that approximately half of all patent-related appeals are overturned. \"The main thing that she mentioned was that being informed and understanding the [case] brief is key,\" whether one is a judge, lawyer, or simply an observer, says BioE senior Janina Vaitkus.

She was also selected to join the Clark School's 2011 Future Faculty program cohort. In 2012, she was one of only ten students to receive a scholarship from the World Organization for Rare Lysosomal Disorders to attend and present her work at its 8th annual meeting. \"Janet is a significant, key player in my lab and research program,\" says Muro. \"She learned the fundamental background and technical skills necessary for her project quite fast and has proven to be a hardworking, motivated and productive young researcher... I am proud of her achievements and eager to see her moving forward with her career.\" Hsu has also mentored several of the Muro Group's high school and undergraduate researchers and served as a teaching assistant for sections of BIOE 120: Biology for Engineers and BIOE 612: Physiological Evaluations of Engineering Designs. She has participated in community activities including serving as the secretary of the Bioengineering Graduate Student Society, serving on the university's Senate Academic Procedures and Standards Committee, participating in Alternative Spring Break, teaching English as a second language in Costa Rica through i-to-i, and membership in Circle K International's University of California-San Diego chapter. SEEDS FELLOWSHIP SUPPORTS SIKORSKI'S W ORK ON BLOOD CLOTTING GEL BioE sophomore Michael Sikorski has received a 2012-2013 Successful Engineering Education and Development Support (SEEDS) Research Fellowship. The National Science Foundation-funded award supports Sikorski's research on blood clotting hydrogels, which he conducts in the Functional Macromolecular Laboratory under the guidance of BioE professor Peter Kofinas.Each year, the SEEDS program funds 20 undergraduates to work on a research project under the guidance of a faculty member or mentor for one academic year. In addition to laboratory experience, SEEDS Fellows also learn to write and submit papers for publication, and have the opportunity to attend professional conferences and symposiums. At the end of the academic year, they present the results of their work at the University of Maryland Undergraduate Research Day. T raumatic injury\u2014whether the result of an accident, crime, or combat\u2014is the leading cause of death of children and adults up to age 44*. Many people who are fatally injured die as the result of hemorrhaging that cannot be stopped or controlled before medical care can be obtained. Surgery also carries the risk of inducing potentially fatal bleeding. Throughout the past decade, a number of hemostatic (blood clotting) products have been introduced that are designed to halt bleeding quickly and without the need for sutures, buying time for severely injured patients in emergency situations. These include biologically active gels for surgical use and biological or synthetic powders and foams that can be applied by first responders and military personnel. Unfortunately, high cost, lack of availability, and limited effectiveness have prevented their widespread use. The Kofinas Group has been developing biocompatible hemostatic polymer hydrogels for traumatic and surgical settings that are inexpensive, effective, and easy to distribute, use and store. When someone suffers an open wound, the body creates a quick clot out of fragments of blood cells called platelets. Nearby blood vessels constrict, and a cascade of enzyme-catalyzed reactions form fibrin, a tougher, more permanent plug that eventually becomes a scab. As the wound heals, the clot is broken down. The material Sikorski works with is designed to give that natural process a boost.\"Our research focuses on the synthesis, characterization, and assessment of topically applied hydrogel microparticles that will augment hemostasis by promoting the formation of a robust plug and forming a physical barrier to blood loss,\" he explains. One day, he may find himself using the product he helped create. \"I volunteer as an EMT here in College Park at the Branchville Volunteer Fire Company,\" he says. \"It is exciting to work on this research because I am reminded every week of how it directly applies to emergency medicine and how it can someday help save the lives of trauma victims.\" * \"Injury: The Leading Cause of Death Among Persons 1-44.\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. www.cdc.gov/injury/overview/leading_cod.html Retrieved 19 December 2012.

TRENTO EXCHANGE BOOSTS RESEARCH ON ARTIFICIAL CELLS BioE graduate student Jessica T errell has departed for the Centre for Integrative Biology at the University of T rento, Italy, where she will spend two months working in Professor Sheref S. Mansy's research group. Terrell, a member of BioE professor and chair William E. Bentley's research group, will build artificial cells equipped with the cellular machinery required to transcribe and translate genes into functional proteins. The synthetic cells are designed to interact with each other and with bacteria through quorum sensing, a form of intercellular communication based on the release and detection of signaling molecules. For the past several years, the Bentley Group has explored how manipulating this chemical language could prevent bacteria from engaging in pathogenic activity, or encourage them to take a positive action. Prior to Terrell's visit, Mansy sent his advisee, University of T rento graduate student Roberta Lentini, to work with the Bentley Group. The two students' research is complimentary: Lentini's artificial cells can respond to a quorum sensing signal molecule known as AI-2, while Terrell's can synthesize and deliver it. \"This project changes the way we can program living cells,\" says Bentley. \"Synthetic biology is largely stuck on the single viewpoint that in order to modify cellular behavior, the genetic content of the cell must be changed. Our approach changes the behavior cells by having artificial cells send chemical signals to natural cells that direct their function.\" The technology, he adds, has far- reaching implications. \"Cell-like systems capable of this sort of communication could be built to block bacterial transitions to virulent states, which could lead to the treatment of infections without antibiotics, and to guide stem cell differentiation, which could lead to improved tissue regeneration for people with serious injuries.\" DAN JANIAK JANIAK NAMED K AUFFMAN FELLOW A. James clark school of engineering alumnus and former fischell fellow Dan Janiak (b.s. '04 and ph.d .

Meanwhile, Remedium Technologies, co-founded by alumnus and former Fischell Fellow Matt Dowling (Ph.D. '10), has received a $500,000 Small Business Innovation Research grant from the NSF to support pre-clinical trials of Hemogrip, a sprayable foam that halts bleeding caused by traumatic injuries. We have more graduating seniors than ever. This spring, 15 Capstone design teams, advised by an ever-expanding roster of fac-ulty and regional physicians, exhibited new biomedical devices they hope will someday improve human health around the world. Our international partnerships are blossom- ing as well, including student exchanges with the Centre for Integrative Biology at the University of Trento, Italy (see p. 14), and research partnerships with Wuhan University, one of China's top ten educa-tional institutions, where Gregory Payne is currently serving a guest professorship. This summer, we'll be welcoming our newest faculty member, Steven M. Jay, who University of Maryland students competed for the chance to tell U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Chief Scientist Jesse L. Goodman their ideas for improving the agency's reporting, information, and application systems in the University of Maryland's Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation's (M-CERSI) first America's Got Regulatory Science Talent student competition, held in February 2013. M-CERSI, a collaborative partnership between the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD), and the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), focuses on modernizing and improving the ways drugs and medical devices are reviewed and evaluated. Researchers from both campuses work with FDA staff to support the development of new tools, standards and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality and performance of FDA-regulated products, and to develop regulatory science practices that promote innovation in medical devices and pharmaceuticals. BioE professor and chair William E. Bentley and BioE affiliate professor James Polli, UMB's Shangraw/Noxell Chair of Pharmaceutical Sciences, serve as the center's co-chairs. The competition, designed to promote student interest in regulatory science, attracted teams of graduate students who proposed bet-ter solutions for reporting side effects, sharing medication regiments among physicians and pharmacies, and increasing patient educa-tion and compliance. School of Medicine student Curtis Gallagher took first prize for his Interactive Medication Guides, which are designed to improve the process of reporting adverse reactions to medications to the FDA. Goodman was impressed with the students' proposals. \"Their winning ideas, WILLIAM BENTLEY and their commitment and excitement, bode well for the future of the sciences involved in ensuring that medical products are safe and effective,\" he wrote on the FDAVoice blog. \"Perhaps above all, the problems that inspired their ideas provided powerful reminders that consumers should be engaged by health professionals and involved in their own care.\" Those interested in the advancement of regulatory science are invited to attend the second UM CERSI Day, which will be held on September 5, 2013 in Baltimore, Md. The daylong event will feature presentations from special guests, faculty and students from UMD and UMB, the FDA, industry, and representatives of the CERSI Industrial Consortia.

Kim Engineering Building University of Maryland College Park, MD 20742-2835 ABOUT THE COVER IMAGE THE PURPLE IMAGE USED ON THE COVERS, FROM PROFESSOR YU CHEN'S RESEARCH GROUP, SHOWS THE INTERNAL MICROANATOMY OF A RAT'S KIDNEY, INCLUDING GLOMERULI, BOWMAN'S SPACE, BLOOD VESSELS, AND PROXIMAL AND DISTAL CONVOLUTED TUBULES IN THE RENAL CORTEX. THE HIGH-RES IMAGE WAS CREATED USING AN IMPROVED 2-PHOTON MICROSCOPY SYSTEM DEVELOPED IN CHEN'S LAB THAT OFFERS A FAST FRAME SPEED AND GREATER SENSITIVITY. THE SYSTEM COULD BE USED TO OBSERVE GLOMERULAR STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, MICROVASCULATURE, CELL VITALITY AND APOPTOSIS, AND LEUKOCYTE TRAFFICKING. CHEN RECENTLY RECEIVED A NSF CAREER AWARD FOR HIS BIOIMAGING RESEARCH. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE OUR COVER STORY. Spinning Engineered Silk Into Tiny Designs\u2014With A Microscope or the tone arm of a record player\u2014to \"see and feel.\" While the cantilever either taps or skims the surface of a sample, a laser tracks the location of its tip. As the tip's location changes, it deflects the laser, which is in turn detected by a photodiode. Ultimately, data collected about motion of the tip are translated into a three-dimensional surface map. The cantilever can also be used to measure mechanical properties at the single molecule level by pulling on a sample and characterizing force profiles. continues page 4If someone says they use a microscope in their research, most people would assume it's because they need to observe something very small. BioE senior Sara Johnson uses one to write messages. Johnson, a member of Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) assistant professor Joonil Seog's research group, is part of a team investigating how an atomic force microscope (AFM) can be used to grow and weave threads of silk-elastin-like peptide polymers (SELPs) into specific patterns or shapes\u2014such as the letters \"UMD\" at only one thousandth of a millimeter wide. She is the first author of a recent paper about the work published in Chemical Communications, one of the premiere journals in its field. SELP is a polymer made out of alternating segments of genetically engineered spider silk and elastin, the protein responsible for giving skin and blood vessels their flexibility. SELP is studied because of its similarity to amyloid fibers, the suspected culprit behind certain neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, and because of its potential applications in tissue engineering. AFM employs a cantilever with a pointed tip\u2014something like a very tiny diving board "}
