In late January, communications regarding its symptoms and proper precautions were sent to the campus community. Spring break study abroad programs were canceled. March and April : President M. Roy Wilson charged a committee composed of health experts and university leaders to prepare a university -wide response that allowed Wayne State to continue its mission. This committee met daily throughout the early days of the pandemic to respond in a manner that prioritized safety and was guided by science. A website facilitating communications was also launched. The state 's first two COVID -19 cases were confirmed on March 10; Wayne State transitioned to remote operations the following week. Spring break was extended to allow more time to prepare faculty and students for the transi- tion, and Human Resources instituted new policies regard- ing flexible work arrangements. To help combat the racial disparities seen throughout the Detroit area throughout the pandemic and assist with the city 's economic response, Gov. Whitmer appointed President Wilson to the Michigan Coronavirus Taskforce on Racial Disparities and Michigan Economic Recovery Council. A virtual commencement ceremony was held in late April. May and June : Classes occurred in strictly remote formats throughout the winter, spring and spring/summer semes- ters, and most campus buildings remained locked. Limited staff remained on campus to support students living in apartments and residence halls. As Gov. Whitmer eased certain restrictions in May and the stay -at-home order lifted in June, research facilities resumed operations and custodial crews returned. The Campus Restart Committee was created to meet regularly, examine the latest data and plan for a potential return to campus in the fall. July: On July 15, President M. Roy Wilson and members of the Campus Restart Committee announced plans to wel- come students back in a limited capacity for the fall se- mester. At a town hall meeting, Wilson announced that classes would be held in a variety of formats \u2014 in-person, remote and hybrid, with the ratio heavily favoring remote classes. The new semester would include use of a Campus Daily Screener tool as well as Warrior Safe is Warrior Strong guidelines, many of which exceeded the guidelines put in place by the governor and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services in order to keep campus safety the first priority. Fall: Students moved back into campus housing over an extended period in August. Classes began in September, with the majority of classes taking place remotely. Campus dining, retail, housing and other services reopened under guidelines to facilitate social distancing and limit capacity. The Campus Health Center conducted monitoring, contact tracing and communications for all COVID -19 cases on campus. The COVID -19 Dashboard was created to allow the university to track cases on campus as well as testing outcomes. These data, combined with data regarding the surrounding community and region, was used to inform decisions related to campus operations. A flu shot mandate was enacted to further protect the campus population. On Nov. 18, guidelines from the Michi- gan Department of Health and Human Services required the suspension of all in -person college classes for three weeks; Wayne State continued that suspension through- out the remainder of the fall semester. Fall commence- ment was conducted virtually in December. The COVID -19 pandemic impacted the world on an unprecedented level, and Wayne State was no exception. Throughout the pandemic, the university was engaged at all levels \u2014 on and off campus. Following is a time- line of Wayne State 's response: 9 Table of Contents Fact Book 2020 -21 In June 2020, the COVID -19 Student Survey was fielded to all undergraduate students who were enrolled during the winter semester. The survey was conducted by Shooshan Dana- goulian (Dept. of Economics), Janet Hankin (Dept. of Sociology) and Allen Goodman (Dept. of Economics) as part of a larger international study. The survey measures challenges students face as a result of COVID -19 and its mitigation measures. Top challenges to completing coursework COVID -19 Student Survey 2,400 undergraduates from WSU responded students from 10 countries and 37 universities Students reported experiencing high levels of psychological distress as a result COVID -19 finding a quiet place to study lack of contact with other students lack of contact with faculty 66% increased family responsibilities 63% 65% 62% Analysis shows psychological distress is higher among female students , students who have a family member with job loss , and students who are caregivers . nervous about current circumstances 83% worried about own health 58% worried about family 's health 87% stressed about leaving home 59% The study emphasizes the need for ongoing psychological and logistical support, particularly as COVID -19 mitigation measures affect the financial and caregiving situation of students. 10 Table of Contents University Leadership President 's Cabinet Deans Fact Book 2020 -21 M.

Fact Book 2020 -21 12 Table of Contents Fact Book 2020 -21 Past Presidents Henry convinced the state legislature to provide funds for veterans ' educa- tion to accommodate the post -war enrollment surge. During this era, State Hall and Science Hall were constructed and tuition residency was enlarged to include all Michigan residents \u2014 putting the university on the path to becoming a state university. During World War II, Bow led WSU through some of its most challenging and important times. Under his leader- ship, the university became an official War Information Center, preparing more than 400,000 people for jobs in Detroit 's war production efforts. Bonner led the university as the nation suffered a severe recession. Under his leadership, Wayne State expanded its international reputation, forging exchange agree- ments with universities in Israel, Germany, Poland and Costa Rica. It also became the nation 's second university to establish scholarly exchanges with the Chinese Academy of Science. As Wayne State 's longest -serving president, Adamany reorganized the university, created three new colleges and launched the then -largest building program in university history. In 1994, one of his major goals was realized when Wayne State was designated a \"Research I\" university by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Frank Cody 1933-42 Warren E. Bow 1942-45 David D. Henry 1945-52 Cody began Wayne State University 's commitment to Detroit and its surrounding communities. Cody 's vision was that schools and colleges should be community centers \u2014 a belief that the university still holds today. Thomas Bonner 1978-82 David Adamany 1982-97 13 Table of Contents Fact Book 2020 -21 Past Presidents Hilberry oversaw the university 's transformation into a state university in 1956. During this time, Wayne State also saw tremendous growth, with 18 new buildings \u2014 including the McGregor Memorial Conference Center and the College of Education \u2014 changing the face of the campus. Keast held Wayne State together during the turbulent late 60s, engaging students in discussions about the Vietnam War, civil rights and the 1967 Detroit riot. During this time, enrollment continued growing and Wayne State offered its first course on African Ameri- can history and opened its first community extension center. Gullen continued WSU 's commitment to diversity by initiating an affirmative action policy, establishing the President 's Commission on the Status of Women and appointing the university 's first female vice president. Under Reid's leadership, Wayne State underwent an amazing transformation, with the addition of three residence halls, the Mort Harris Recreation and Fitness Center, the WSU Welcome Center, and more. During Reid 's tenure, TechTown \u2014 a 43 -acre technology park adjacent to campus \u2014 was also created. Noren collaborated with School of Medicine leaders to strengthen the university 's relationships with the Detroit Medical Center, Henry Ford Health System and other partners. During his tenure, the university also opened the Marvin I. Danto Engineering Development Center. Wayne State 's reputation as a premier research university continued to grow under Gilmour's leadership. During his time at WSU, construction began on the Integrative Biosciences Center and the university was awarded a second 10-year contract from the National Institutes of Health for its Perinatology Research Branch.

Historical Events Fact Book 2020 -21 25 Table of Contents 2020 Developments Fact Book 2020 -21 Wayne State responds to COVID -19 Like nearly every institution, Wayne State University was dramatically impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Before the virus was confirmed in Michigan, university officials were preparing for its potential impact and enacting strategies that allowed Wayne State to continue its mission while keeping the safety of the Warrior community the first priority. In March, President M. Roy Wilson charged a committee composed of individuals from throughout the Wayne State community \u2014 including health experts, housing and facilities officials, academic leaders, communications specialists, and more \u2014 to prepare a multi -pronged response. Shortly after the first two COVID -19 cases were confirmed in Michigan, the committee put its plans into action. Human Resources rapidly instituted new policies regarding flexible work arrangements. The Office of Teaching and Learning and the Academic Success Center launched websites to support online teaching and learning. Services across the university stood up remote operations. Classes were held online and employees began working from home beginning in mid -March. Most campus buildings were closed and locked throughout the first six months of the pandemic, and a Campus Restart Team was charged with developing a plan for the fall semester. In September, classes began to be held in a variety of formats, including in-person, remote and hybrid, with the majority of classes occurring remotely. Health and safety guidelines were enacted to ensure safety on campus, and employees who could continue working from home were encouraged to do so. The Campus Health Center took the lead on testing and contact tracing throughout campus. Those returning to campus to work or learn were required to complete safety training and complete the Campus Daily Screener; a COVID - 19 dashboard was created to keep track of cases and potential outbreaks on campus. More information about Wayne State 's on-campus response to COVID -19 is available on page 8 this book. But the Warrior community 's work extended beyond campus borders, as students, faculty and staff from all areas of the university pitched in to meet a variety of needs in Detroit, across Michigan and beyond. Students and faculty in Wayne State 's health -related schools and colleges contributed to making hand sanitizer for first responders, stood up COVID -19 drive -thru testing and conducted research that provided a better understanding of the virus. Volunteers sewed face coverings for front -line workers, created virtual performances for families stuck at home, placed hand -washing stations for the homeless throughout the city and more. And that doesn 't include the number of Warrior faculty, students and alumni working on the front lines in hospitals and clinics across the country. The pandemic tested the mettle of people around the globe, and Wayne State University 's community showed the world what it means to be Warrior Strong in the face of an unprecedented challenge. 26 Table of Contents 2020 Developments Fact Book 2020 -21 Wayne State welcomes largest freshman class in its history In fall 2020, Wayne State University welcomed the largest group of full -time freshmen in its 150 -year history. When classes began Aug. 29, there were 3,019 full -time freshmen \u2014 an increase of 5% over the previous year 's incoming freshman class. \"Now, more than ever, students are excited about Wayne State and about the opportunities here in Detroit, \" said Provost Keith Whitfield. \"This exciting influx of new students further solidifies Wayne State as a top -choice, destination institution. \" Indicators showed that this year 's freshman class was diverse and academically strong. The class also included the university 's largest FTIAC group - composed of full- and part -time students entering their first year at any college or university - in a decade. \"We succeeded in focusing on creating connections with students as they navigated the college decision process, \" said Dawn Medley, associate vice president for enrollment management. \"We've made a strong, strategic effort to share the Wayne State story, and to share how each student fits within that story. \" Medley also cited a recently restructured financial aid award process as a contributing factor for the increase. The university has increased its commitment to low - income and first -generation students through a robust suite of awards and programs, including a first -generation fee waiver and the Wayne ACCESS Award, which covers the full cost of all tuition and fees. More than one third of the incoming freshman class are recipients of the Wayne ACCESS Award and will pay zero out -of-pocket costs. Additionally, the financial aid award process now takes a holistic approach to evaluating merit -based scholarships, rather than the traditional focus on standardized test scores. For example, WSU partnered with Raise.me, a program that allows high school students as early as ninth grade to earn micro -scholarships for various achievements, including GPA and test accomplishments, volunteering, holding a leadership position in a school organization, or participating in an extracurricular activity or sport. \"While we have always recognized students who are academically gifted, we 're also recognizing students who are hardworking and ambitious and who serve as leaders in their communities, \" Medley said. \"It's an approach that mirrors the story of Detroit \u2014 we value hard work and effort. \" \"There 's never been a better time to be a Warrior, or to be helping Warriors, \" said Ericka Matthews -Jackson, director of admissions. \"The compassion and dedication our entire enrollment management team as well as the teamwork from all members of our campus community is apparent in the continued growth of our student body, and we look forward to helping them succeed at WSU. \" 27 Table of Contents 2020 Developments Fact Book 2020 -21 Wayne State University center to train officers in de -escalation This year, it was announced that the Wayne State University Police Department (WSUPD) would be the national and regional headquarters for the National De-escalation Training Center (NDTC). This hybrid de-escalation training \u2014 known as DISC Esoterica \u2014 is specifically designed for law enforcement officers, providing special assessment and situational skills training that is noted to reduce conflict and avoid potential tragic scenarios for citizens and officers. The de -escalation course is offered through a partnership between the Wayne State University Police Department and the nonprofit NDTC. The copyrighted, trademarked and tested program provides hours of in -depth training to WSUPD officers and will soon be made available to police departments around the United States through regional centers. The NDTC 's training is based upon the DISC assessment, the most widely used personality model around the world. The NDTC model, which is known as the new DISC Esoterica personality model, is a hybrid of the DISC assessment and is the first major improvement and most significant advancement in DISC since its creation by William Marston in 1928. The augmentations to DISC that are added by Esoterica expand the four traditional DISC personalities into 26 subtype traits that provide a swifter and clearer determination of an individual's personality during an encounter. DISC Esoterica trains an officer to understand behavior and intentions in a matter of sec-onds, decreasing the potential for volatility while gaining peaceful compliance. \"You want to let the person know, 'Now I understand what kind of promise you have, ' and you can see, individually, what this person is going through, and understand what those next steps are to take, \" said Wayne State University Police Chief Anthony Holt. \"The community and the citizens want to see this in action. \" Two classes of Wayne State University police officers have successfully completed the DISC Esoterica de -escalation training. Officers went through 16 hours of classroom, hands -on and simulator -augmented training scenarios for optimum training outcomes. Recertification training will be provided to all WSUPD officers on a semiannual basis. The Wayne State University Police Department believes that the National De -escalation Training Center is an invaluable investment in its officers, and ultimately in the community. As a nonprofit entity, it better serves the interests of the public sector because it allows Wayne State University to access grant funding to defray training costs that would otherwise be borne by the department. The partnership between the Wayne State University Police Department and the NDTC also allows for ongoing research with nationally and regionally accredited universities, nonprofit institutions, and law enforcement agencies to further collaborate, innovate and develop common training standards in de -escalation based upon best practices. 28 Table of Contents 2020 Developments Fact Book 2020 -21 Wayne State University completed construction on the STEM Innovation Learning Center (SILC), and commemo- rated the occasion on Oct. 1 with an interactive virtual celebration complete with live remarks, a 3D tour, drone flyover and more. The SILC, made possible by a $14.75 million commitment from the State of Michigan and bond proceeds to WSU, will serve as a campus hub for interdisciplinary teaching, learning and innovation. The building features 100,000 square feet of flexible classrooms, instructional labs, a maker space, and 3D printing lab with state -of-the-art technology to support hands -on and project -based learning. \"The STEM Innovation Learning Center will provide count- less educational and research opportunities for students and faculty from across campus, \" said Wayne State University President M. Wilson. \"In supporting this project, the State of Michigan has also invested in talent and workforce development, and this facility will benefit Wayne State \u2014 and the city of Detroit \u2014 for generations to come. \" In keeping with the university 's health and safety guide- lines, the STEM Innovation Learning Center opened with limited access and will initially be used for space necessary for essential student support services. In the future, it will play a crucial role in achieving Wayne State 's vision for STEM education and research, as well as supporting K -12 students from the greater Detroit area with experiences and exposure to hands -on, creative learning to ignite their interest in science and technology. \"Detroit is and always has been a center for innovation in Michigan, and this new facility will provide a crucial resource to Wayne State students and Detroit -area K -12 students who are interested in pursuing a career in STEM, \" said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. \"This is exactly what we need to attract more talent and investment to our state and build a strong workforce. I applaud Wayne State University for their dedication to Detroit -area students, and look forward to working with them moving forward. \" The STEM Innovation Learning Center will provide undergraduate instructional laboratories, classrooms and dedicated student collaboration zones for STEM and STEM -collaborative courses across the 10 Wayne State schools and colleges that support undergraduate education. Addi- tionally, the building will support faculty and graduate students as a unique, inspiring space for seminars, teaching and research presentations. \"This is a tremendous project that will bring tremendous opportunity to our students and the greater Detroit community, \" said Tonya Matthews, associate provost for inclusive workforce development and director of the STEM Innovation Learning Center. \"The easy problems have already been solved. What lies before us in STEM are the kinds of challenges and innovations that require diverse teams trained in rigorous, interdisciplinary contexts. Wayne State is training future Warriors to take on some of the most pressing science and society issues of the day, from global pandemics to machine learning to using STEM as a tool for social justice \u2014 and now we have an extraor- dinary space designed to do so. \" STEM Innovation Center 29 Table of Contents Spring and fall commencement celebrations at Wayne State University were different \u2014 but no less memorable \u2014 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Due to the need to continue practicing social distancing, Wayne State created virtual graduation celebrations that were launched on April 29 for spring commencement ceremonies and on Dec. 15 for fall commencement. The university 's colleges, schools, and various other depart- ments and divisions partnered with the Office of Mar- keting and Communications to plan the virtual celebra- tions and recognize graduates for their perseverance in a challenging year. \"The coronavirus pandemic caused major disruptions in our lives and necessitated major decisions at all levels, \" said Michael Wright, vice president of marketing and communications and chief of staff. \"Following the decision to postpone the university 's commencement, we collabo- rated with the schools and colleges, Special Events, and the president 's office to create a virtual celebration. This is an important milestone for our graduates, and although we could not be in person to celebrate, we did not want the time to pass without acknowledging their accomplish- ments. We are grateful for the quick collaboration across campus to create the various digital activities. \" Through the collective efforts of the university community, schools and colleges created personal graduation acknowl- edgement videos, which were posted on the commence- ment website.

It uses the advantages of its urban setting to develop and deliver su perb teaching and research that benefits the community and advances social, economic and environmental justice. The school offers degree programs at the bachelor 's, master 's and doctoral levels, as well as five graduate certificate programs. Over the last year, innovative changes have occurred within the SSW. These include the launch of a minor in social work and social justice, an op por- tunity to specialize in 'holistic defense ' with law school students, and classroom - and community -based initiatives promoting the expansion of engagement with the community during this time of crises. In the 2019 -20 year, the Center for Behavioral Health and Justice (CBHJ) expanded significantly. Currently, six different initia tives, involving 25 counties across Michigan and Indiana, focus on diverting individuals with mental health and/or substance use dis or- ders from the criminal legal system to appropriate services. CBHJ staff successfully facilitate Change Teams that use a commu nity of practice model to improve identification, referral and services across a continuum of care. For example, when Detroit was esp ecial- ly hard hit by the COVID -19, this was particularly devastating for county jails. In collaboration with the Wayne County Jail, WS U partners and the Michigan Justice Fund, the CBHJ team developed a mitigation strategy within the jail and then compiled a too lkit so that these successful strategies could be shared with other jails across the country to reduce the spread of COVID -19 in thei r facilities. In addition to the CBHJ, the school also houses the Center for Social Work Research (CSWR), which assists faculty and students in the management of nearly $19.8 million in active grant research in six primary core research areas: aging, child welfare, community, policy and program development, criminal justice, health and behavioral health, and interpersonal violence. The CS WR will be working closely with Social Work Professor Poco Kernsmith during the implementation of her new $2.25 million Center f or Disease Control Division of Violence Prevention funded grant, which aims to strengthen violence prevention and response effor ts in Michigan K -12 schools. Beyond its reputation for providing quality education, the school is known for its commitment to student success and retentio n. Detroit and Southeast Michigan have a distinct set of challenges and opportunities that offer insights for social work practi ce in diverse urban environments. This urban context provides rich and compelling student field experiences that aid in developing professional competence and preparing students to uphold the core values of the social work profession. SSW students are larg ely non-traditional and the school recognizes that students have competing demands. Therefore, the school offers customized degree options including a fully online bachelor of social work degree, a hybrid online M.S.W. program, as well as full - and part -time degree options at Wayne State 's main campus or the University Center Macomb in Clinton Township. The Office of Field Education uses an innovative placement process that results in the best possible match between the interests of students and their fiel d placement sites. Annually, the college hosts more than 600 students at more than 300 social work, social welfare, education, health, criminal justice and other human service organization field placement sites in Michigan and Canada, contributing more than 300,000 field hours to the community. A college degree is expensive, and the SSW has worked diligently with our community partners and donors to raise funds that e ase this financial burden for students while supporting its research endeavors and building renovation efforts. The school is pro ud to announce the completion of its building renovation at 5447 Woodward Avenue, which now provides innovative classroom space, expanded faculty areas and the opportunity to engage students and community partners through events and discussions. The school looks forward to continuing to evolve as a school to meet the ever -changing needs of its students, community and global social work family. 32 Full-Time Faculty 72% (23) Tenured and Tenure Track 28% (9) Non -Tenured 954 Fall 2020 Enrollment 726 Full -Time Students 228 Part -Time StudentsSponsored Awards $5.3M Budget $5.7M For 85 years, the Wayne State University School of Social Work (SSW) has been located in the heart of Midtown Detroit.

Researchers from Wayne State University 's College of Engineering and the Henry Ford Health System teamed up to design and implement such a system \u2014 and took on several challenges in doing so. The team collaborated to begin designing a system to assess infection risk at different levels, such as individually or at large -event and institution levels. The system must also dynamically update the risk level based on the latest outbreak reports, as well as be able to preserve user -sensitive data while sharing adequate and appropriate data that allows risk -level calculation. The team attacked these challenges with the help of a $150,000 RAPID grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and a $10,000 Google Cloud Platform grant. The project, \"CORPUS: An Edge Intelligence -assisted Multi - Granularity COVID -19 Risk Prediction and Update System, \" will design and implement a system that includes a mobile app running on personal phones, as well as a large -scale distributed protocol behind the app that collects and updates the information. \"CORPUS will build a multigranularity risk -analysis model that covers fine -grained personal risk; small, clustered meeting risk; and coarse -grained large clustered event/ organizational risk, \" said Weisong Shi, Ph.D., associate dean of research and graduate studies and professor of computer science at Wayne State. \"In addition, CORPUS will employ a data -propagation protocol to build and update the risk - analysis model. \" The data could include spatial data (GPS signal), temporal data (calendar events), as well as input from the user (meeting with a specific person). To insure confidentiality of personal information, CORPUS will leverage privacy - preserving algorithms such as node -level feature pooling and anonymous parameters of the model instead of raw user data when multigranularity models request personal risk information. \"The great thing about CORPUS is that it will have the potential to meet the needs of many by leveraging personalized information and edge intelligence, \" said Shi. \"For a group or an organization, CORPUS will provide risk - related information to help them judge the feasibility of holding a meeting or an event during an outbreak, especially for large -scale international events, such as conferences and more. \" 75 Table of Contents 2020 Research Highlights Fact Book 2020 -21 Wayne State University team receives $1.98 million NIH award to develop diagnostic tests for sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease of unknown causes that affects multiple organs in the body, occurs in patients around the world and is highly prevalent in Detroit and throughout Michigan. It is characterized by abnormal mass- es or nodules - granuloma formations - in various organs, including lungs and lymph glands, the brain, and the heart. Sarcoidosis has been described for more than 150 years, but there are no specific and simple tests developed to diagnose this disease. A team of researchers led by Lobelia Samavati, M.D., associ- ate professor in the Center for Molecular Medicine and Ge- netics and Department of Internal Medicine at Wayne State University 's School of Medicine, has been working for more than 10 years to discover specific serological biomarkers of sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. With the help of a $1.98 -million grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, Samavati 's research team aims to advance their work of developing biomarker technology for identification of biomarkers of sarcoidosis. Samavati developed a comprehensive library derived from sarcoidosis tissue that can differentiate between sarcoidosis and several other respiratory disorders. Using a high - throughput method, her team developed a complex epitope library derived from materials of sarcoidosis patients. This cDNA library contains large numbers of epitopes im- munoscreened with from patients with sarcoidosis high titer IgG antibodies and the cloned phages, which have been used to construct an antigen microarray to detect antibodies against sarcoid antigen(s) in the sera of test subjects. Samavati 's grant, \"A Novel T7 Phage Display Technology to Detect Sarcoidosis Specific Antigens, \" aims to advance and refine her technology to discriminate sarcoidosis from latent tuberculosis and healthy controls. The team has identified novel antibodies that may be used as a molecular therapy target, and their goal over the next four years is to further map these peptides and identify their biological function. Their current data indicates that some of these peptides can be used as diagnostic tools, while others can be used as therapy targets. The overall goal is to define the specific antigens initiating granuloma formation in sarcoidosis and how immunity in response to the antigen leads to sarcoidosis and latent tuberculosis. In the future, this approach could be used to identify a panel of biomarkers useful for diagnosis of various organ involvements in sarcoidosis and differential diagnosis of other granulomatous diseases or response to treatment in sarcoidosis subjects. Furthermore, the identified antigens can be used to develop a model for sarcoidosis. \"We believe that our technology will be able to harness the diversity of antibodies and can aid to identify protective an- tibodies in various diseases in humans, including viral respir- atory infections such as the corona virus,\" said Samavati. \"We believe that this study is the beginning of new era to identify protective immunity in form of antibodies. 76 Table of Contents 2020 Research Highlights Fact Book 2020 -21 Physics JETSCAPE collaboration receives $4 million NSF grant renewal A multi -institutional study led by Wayne State University physicists and computer scientists will continue, thanks to a grant from the National Science Foundation totaling more than $4 million over four years. Researchers working on the JETSCAPE collaboration say the new funding will allow them to continue to study critical elements of high -energy nuclear physics. The collaboration consists of a multidisciplinary team of physicists, computer scientists and statisticians from 13 institutions. The team will create an open -source statistical and computational software to help scientists better under- stand high -energy nuclear collisions. Microseconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the universe was more than several trillion degrees Celsius. At this temperature, protons and neutrons melt into a plasma of quarks and gluons called a Quark -Gluon Plasma (QGP). The exact internal structure and interactions within the QGP is still unknown. Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) collide large nuclei such as lead at extreme energies and achieve the compression necessary to produce exploding droplets of this exotic state of matter. The JETSCAPE collaboration aims to better understand the dynamics of these collisions and the QGP through sophisti- cated computer simulations that allow a variety of theoreti- cal models to be explored in rigorous statistical comparisons with experimental data. Wayne State physics professor and lead investigator Abhijit Majumder is one of the top experts in the development of theoretical techniques for understanding the dynamics of high -energy nuclear collisions. \"This renewal will allow the JETSCAPE tool to broaden and evolve into a much more elaborate simulator, which could be applied to a variety of future experiments, \" said Majum- der. \"This will bring all high -energy nuclear experiments under a single simulation umbrella, allowing for a cross - pollination of ideas between different experiments. \" Hypoxic -Ischemic brain Injury (HII) is a severe injury caused by oxygen deprivation to the brain at or near time of birth in preterm or low birth weight newborns.

In order to efficiently carry out the reactions that lead to energy generation and storage using these technologies, better and cheaper catalysts must be developed. Eranda Nikolla, Ph.D., professor of chemical engineering in Wayne State University 's College of Engineering, received a $533,837 research award this year from the Department of Energy 's Office of Science for her proposal \"Tuning Catalyti- cally Active Single Sites in Non -stoichiometric, Mixed Metal Oxides for Oxygen Electrocatalysis, \" which aims to address this need. Nikolla 's work focuses on the development of efficient electrochemical systems for energy generation and storage. She aims to combine computational tools with nanoscience and catalysis to design catalytically active cationic sites in non-stoichiometric, mixed metal oxides for oxygen reduction and evolution \u2014 key reactions in renewable electrochemical energy conversion systems, such as generation of H2 from water. The proposed work will have a significant impact on the development of efficient energy conversion systems. \"It is a great honor that our research has been funded by the U.S. Department of Energy 's Basic Energy Sciences, \" said Nikolla. \"This work will have a significant impact in the field by providing fundamental insights that can guide tuning of cationic sites in mixed metal oxide electrocatalysts for energy generation and storage. \" This project is a collaboration between the Wayne State University Department of Biomedical Engineering, the neonatology program in Wayne State 's School of Medicine, the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan and the Department of Neonatology at Harvard Medical School. The team plans to fully test the 3D -nPAT technique for future potential clinical use.

As part of Michigan 's University Research Corridor along with Michigan State University and the University of Michigan, it plays a vital role in bringing new talent, technology and jobs to the state. 89 Table of Contents Fact Book 2020 -21 The Wayne State University Foundation was established by the university 's Board of Governors in 2000 as a centralized means to encourage and manage financial support from private sources. The foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation. Though independent of the university, it partners with the Division of Development and Alumni Affairs in realizing Wayne State 's overall advancement objectives. The foundation is governed by a board of directors made up of prominent business and community leaders. It is led by a chair chosen from among these individuals and a president who also holds the university title of vice president for development and alumni affairs. Working together, the Wayne State University Foundation and the Division of Development and Alumni Affairs cultivate private support to advance the university 's mission. Funds raised enable Wayne State to offer undergraduate and graduate student scholarships, endow faculty chairs and professor- ships, advance academic and scientific programs and investigations, and enhance the campus infrastruc- ture. During Fiscal Year 2020, Wayne State University raised more than $48.9 million in new gifts and pledg- es from more than 23,300 donors. The Wayne State University Foundation includes an investment committee that assists the board with all investment -related decisions, including oversight of the university 's endowment. As of Sept. 30, 2020, the end of the last reporting period, the endowment totaled $425 million. Earned income from the endow- ment provides funding for donor -identified purposes in perpetuity. Nearly two -thirds of the endowment at Wayne State is designated for student and faculty support. The university 's most recent comprehensive fundrais- ing campaign, \"Pivotal Moments, \" concluded on September 30, 2018. The campaign, which had a goal of $750 million, raised more than $776.5 million to support scholarship, research, community engage- ment and campus infrastructure priorities at Wayne State.

Recent Construction Projects at WSU Chatsworth Apartment Building The Chatsworth Apartment Building is a historic apartment building constructed in the 1920s. The university recently completed a comprehensive renovation project that maintained the architectural- ly historic structure while updating and modernizing the interior. Elements such as a historically accurate lobby and lounge, leaded glass entry, and restored lighting fixtures were included in the restoration. The project also renovated the 86 existing apart- ments and reconfigured them into 96 new units containing 368 beds in a state -of-the-art residence hall. Guest housing was included on the first floor to support college guests and staff. A seminar room and lounges with the latest technology were added on the first floor. 97 Table of Contents STEM Innovation Learning Center The STEM Innovation Learning Center (SILC) is a signature component of Wayne State University's vision for STEM education through multidisciplinary learning and community engagement that builds upon the university 's vision for inclusive innovation. Built with an emphasis on technology, collaboration and \"science -on-display\" spaces, the SILC brings a centralized STEM -focused academic facility to the heart of campus - located within steps of chemistry, biology, engineering and physics buildings, as well as the iconic learning spaces of Science Hall and Old Main.

Fact Book 2020 -21 School of Social Work - Phase II The former Detroit Institute for Children building located at 5447 Woodward was purchased in 2014 by the university for the purpose of housing the School of Social Work. The building is approximately 32,000 gross square feet, comprising two stories and a base- ment. Upon purchase of the building, the university pro- ceeded with renovation in two phases. The Phase I scope included renovation of the basement and all but the east wing of the first and second floors, deferred maintenance projects as required through- out the building, and relocation of faculty and admin-istrative offices to the newly renovated facility. Phase II began in 2018 and completed the renovation of the east wing of the first and second floors. Project scope included the creation of faculty offices, tech- nology -rich seminar spaces, meeting space, and a large student lounge and flexible study space facing Woodward Avenue. The project also removed a large portion of the brick wall facing Woodward, exposing a outdoor courtyard space. The renovation also included replacement of existing windows in the entire building. 98 Table of Contents Fact Book 2020 -21 Gateway Performance Complex Since 1963, the Hilberry Theatre has been a vital part of the Wayne State University landscape, providing a training ground for actors, designers, stage managers and theatre managers to hone their craft and grow from talented artists to skilled professionals. A new project will further solidify Wayne State's reputation as an artistic leader. Wayne State University will enhance the growing and vibrant area just south of campus by creating the Gateway Performance Complex, a $69.5 million performance complex for theatre, music, dance and arts -related events. As part of the complex, which broke ground in fall 2018, the Hilberry Theatre will be renovated to become the Gretchen Valade Jazz Center (GVJC), a high -caliber venue for music and dance perfor- mances. The 200 -seat GVJC will offer ample seating for parents, patrons, donors and community mem- bers for dance events. The renovated space also will enable the dance program to feature master classes and lectures. The Gateway Performance Complex will herald a new approach to theatre at Wayne State. Faculty mem- bers have unanimously approved a move away from repertory theatre toward a model that allows for greater variety, better serves students and reflects regional theatres across the nation. A new curriculum in musical theatre, for example, will create a series of performances that blend dance, music and theatre. For the first time, students in the Hilberry program will live together in a dedicated learning community. The Thompson Home, a Victorian building across from the new complex, has been transformed into a unique living and learning environment, augmenting students' social and educational experiences while fostering a sense of community in the university 's performing arts programs. The Gateway Performance Complex will include: A new 350 -seat main theatre on the corner of Cass and Forest Full-thrust stage with appropriate wing space and a fly system New dressing rooms, make -up rooms, green rooms and production accommodations New audio and visual booths will bolster the performances, allowing state -of-the-art audio, video and lighting technology during production New office space located within the complex for administrative purposes A modern caf\u00e9 will be a highly visible and energetic space where guests mingle before and after events, during intermissions and beyond Patron lounge will allow invited guests to relax and socialize before the show A gallery showcasing the incredible history of the Hilberry, with a variety of artifacts, photos and memorabilia, will be another gathering place 99 Table of Contents Wayne State Athletics, in partnership with the Detroit Pistons, is building a new arena for Wayne State 's men 's and women 's basketball teams, as well as the Pistons ' G League Team.
