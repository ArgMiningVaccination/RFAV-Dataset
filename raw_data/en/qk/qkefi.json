There's a lot more going on than that. That being said - I find it interesting that the people who make the most noise about their faith are the ones I find most lacking in those qualities that I would associate with soulfulness, never mind basic human decency - Andy, Kenservative and most of the nutjobs on CP are pretty close to the top of that list. [PFoster](/wiki/User:PFoster)22:22, 8 January 2008 (EST) - I strongly agree. One thing that I'm especially aggravated by is the preoccupation with the aggregation of personal wealth, and its retainment, that many people in Andy's camp exhibit. Personally, I'd give away the majority of my finances in a second, and will probably end up doing it as soon as I get out of college (i.e. don't need huge funds anymore), and I feel that this is the course most compatible, in my mind, with Christianity.

I agree with you 100% about those proclaiming their faith, and extend it to those proclaiming their \"liberalness\" or \"conservatism\" as well. My experience here has shown me that those claiming to be the most liberal are also among those seeking to censor or punish others, exactly the same as those on CP who disagree with any small amount to moderation, anything that goes against their very small minority YEC/Fundamentalist POV.

He ended up being elected and being the laughing stock of Europe for many years. What I mean is, it's easy to overreact to something like that, the newspaper in my case, CP in yours. Laughing at them is good - changing your mind because of them probably not. I don't know the state of religion and christianity in the States, but definitely the CP version is as far from the real one as conceivably possible, at least in my world. Organized religion has many good and often overlooked qualities and achievements - despite their stands on some issues. [Ed @](/wiki/User:Editor_at_CP) [but not the Poor one!](/wiki/User_talk:Editor_at_CP) 04:51, 9 January 2008 (EST) - Thankfully, you surmise correctly, Editor! Andy's/CP's version of Christianity is far from what is normal! They often mistake religion for politics and vice-versa. Odd that as Christians they seem to cling to so much of the Old Testament, I think. Thankfully the vast majority of Christians utterly reject the hate Andy screams daily from his blog. -- [TK](/wiki/User:TK) [/MyTalk](/wiki/User_talk:TK)Remember: Old Prunes Are Usually Bitter 05:14, 9 January 2008 (EST) Bump This needs to be talked about to no end.

[Shangrala](/wiki/User:Shangrala) 23:17, 8 January 2008 (EST) - Am I the only one who has ever wondered if PJR is a parodist?

Same with Kenservative. -- [TK](/wiki/User:TK) [/MyTalk](/wiki/User_talk:TK)Remember: Old Prunes Are Usually Bitter 23:31, 8 January 2008 (EST) - Meh, almost every single editor at CP says things that make me think they're parodists, and that doesn't except you. Sheer probability suggests at least one or two of them are the genuine article, but wouldn't it be kind of funny in a schadenfreude kind of way if every single person at CP didn't in fact believe the things they said? Anyway, as one of those breast loving liberals, you know what I reckon is a crime? When you go to the beach in India, and half the people there are covered head to toe and 90% of them can't swim.

Cricket on the beach is a waste of a perfectly good holiday. --Jevs [Your signature gave me epilepsy...](/wiki/User_talk:Jeeves)23:41, 8 January 2008 (EST) - Actually when you go to a nudist beach most of the bodies are actually pretty ugly unless you find a beach with an above average percentage of 18-30s. And PJR's temptation arguments are rather in the vein of those Islamists who justify raping women for exposing their hair or somesuch. Of course in a \"proper\" swimming pool there is a good reason for wearing a swimming costume, it reduces the drag of all those floppy bits and hair. [Genghis](/wiki/User:Genghis_Khant) [Marauding](/wiki/User_talk:Genghis_Khant)02:42, 9 January 2008 (EST) - Gawd knows I would gross out that beach! Maybe not 20 yeaaaarrrrs ago, but now?

PJR is a master at using the Bible to support whatever it is he is postulating, and ignoring it when it doesn't, or finding something else that marginally undermines another's biblical argument.

Examples: [Abortion and the Bible](http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Abortion_Facts&direction=next&oldid=344072) [France](http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=World_War_II&oldid=349245) [Shangrala](/wiki/User:Shangrala)23:29, 8 January 2008 (EST) - Maybe this would work better if you explained what it is about those images that you think is improper...... -- [TK](/wiki/User:TK) [/MyTalk](/wiki/User_talk:TK)Remember: Old Prunes Are Usually Bitter 23:34, 8 January 2008 (EST) - It probably has to do with the over simplification of the subject matter; it's not France, it's a map of the nation during the second world war (or at least, it should be set during the second world war).-- [142.68.54.222](/w/index.php?title=User:142.68.54.222&action=edit&redlink=1)00:30, 9 January 2008 (EST) - It probably has to do with the over simplification of the subject matter; it's not France, it's a map of the nation during the second world war (or at least, it should be set during the second world war).-- - Well, the WW2 case is mostly WTF because the image is so completely not representative of the article. An article about World War 2 should have an image of... I dunno... something you associate with it at the top. Hitler, a Nazi parade, war victims, a propaganda poster, a tank, bombers, something like that. - The undisputed king of image overkill abuse has to be Conservative, though. He fanatically includes image of EVERYTHING that is mentioned in the article (Esp. in pet articles like Atheism, Homosexuality, ToE, etc. Not sure, but I'd be willing to bet that he is also responsible for all the images in the Dawkins article). -- [Sid](/wiki/User:Sid)08:22, 9 January 2008 (EST) - What make that especially funny is that [User:C's](http://www.conservapedia.com/Image:Wicked.jpg)first upload, (which that link points to), was at the end of JULY...a full four months after starting to edit CP, (and after months of editing WP under [kdbuffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/user:kdbuffalo)), after being a sysop for three full months!!!

Welcome to CP. - Long answer: Yes. He's a CP sysop, and as such, he has 100% authority, is always 100% correct, and has 0% accountability... unless somebody higher up in the chain disagrees. So if Fox felt like dishing out a month, then that's his call. Andy can overrule him, and other sysops can discuss the block in public or private with him. But effectively, only Andy and Fox can undo the block without discussion. (Exception: Obvious mistakes, like banning the guy who reverted vandalism.) - CP has a very arbitrary block/appeal system.

TK himself is an advocate of block IP banning on the grounds that one amongst hundreds of thousands may be a sock of someone at RW. The man is a liar, and a cyberthug: his time here proved that. Having failed to win a sysop position here, or many friends, he came crawling back to CP -probably at \"someone elses\" instigation... - and expected to be received like the returning hero. Wrong. Within a few edits he was trying to throw his weight around, and then went and did exactly what anyone who knows him knew he would: sent email threats to a sysop because of his vastly over-inflated ego. TK will NEVER be a good addition to CP, and is the cause of the majority of the things that are wrong with its administration.

Because there are many posts here, and on the RW Forum stating I was never helping or working for RW. I think we have been through all this before, and surely you don't want to be the cause of another round of posted emails, IMs and the like, possibly outing even more current RW socks, etc., right? -- - In the post-TK era, it's hard to see how Andy could easily trust anyone again.

Which can be meaningless, of course. Anyway, bunchofnumbers can rue their nastiness in contemplative silence for a bit... Back to the topic at hand: TK, you are correct. I am ignorant about a lot of the details of this stuff, and all I have to go on is my own speculation and interpretation of events. I respectfully submit that you're reading a little too much into my comment. When I said \"best\" blocker above, I didn't mean in terms of quantity; I have no idea what the numbers are. But I do think (and this is my opinion) that you were the \"best\" (for lack of a better word; maybe \"most effective\" is better) gatekeeper in terms of deciding who stayed and who went. And I never stated, nor did I mean to imply, that you infiltrated CP on behalf of RW. I actually have no idea what your motives at CP were, and perhaps I should have used a word different from \"infiltrate\" above. But given that you were blocked, and given the position you had there before, I conjecture that Andy has realized that he allowed someone whom he disagreed with enough to block (you) to become a pretty influential sysop. In my opinion, if that's what happened, then he'd be less likely to let that happen again by circling the wagons a little tighter. That's all I meant by my previous comment. I apologize if it wasn't clear.-- [Bayes](/wiki/User:Bayes) [update](/wiki/User_talk:Bayes) 04:43, 14 January 2008 (EST) - Thanks, Bayes! I appreciate and understand the explanation. While I was there it was my perception that DanH and TerryH were the most influential. At least those were the two main sysops I almost always checked with before doing a block. Funny how we all look at things so differently when standing in different parts of the same room! -- [TK](/wiki/User:TK) [/MyTalk](/wiki/User_talk:TK)Lowly editor 07:19, 14 January 2008 (EST) - (Random indent level since this is a reply to Bayes, way up there. Also warning: Excessively long reply.) - The issue of Andy's trust started way sooner than TK, although I think we all agree that the TK fallout didn't exactly lighten his mood. - No, Andy's entire approach is screwy, and people like me criticized his \"Meritocracy\" months ago. While a true Meritocracy might work, Andy's version doesn't, and for a bunch of reasons: - Andy defines \"merit\" as \"things he likes\". It's completely based on ideology. People like Richard became sysop in little to no time because they pretended to be just as ultra-conservative as he is. On the flipside, people who showed knowledge of the wiki software and fought vandalism weren't (and aren't) promoted because Andy simply doesn't like their point of view. (A more extreme case of this can be found below) - Building up on that, it's easier to become sysop than to be stripped of power. Way easier. When you are sysop, you have practically zero accountability, and Andy will only slap you if you bully one of his darlings. But as long as you bully \"liberals\", you're safe. Andy sides with his sysops (which represent his choice of who is trustworthy - and Andy would rather break his fingers before admitting that he totally screwed up), even and especially when people complain about them. Back, when CP actually had a dedicated Sysop Complaints page (as opposed to the Help Desk section there), Conservative needed his own page. With dedicated archives. And nothing ever happened. Eventually, the pages were simply deleted again. - The general paranoia about socks and proxies also led to the behavior CP shows now. Karajou for example uses Checkuser on practically everybody he doesn't like and interrogates them when he thinks something is up. So no matter how much merit your edits have, you can still get banned or insulted because a sysop doesn't like your IP (see also [Conservapedia:Forbidden Cities](/wiki/Conservapedia:Forbidden_Cities)) - Connected to the first point: The question about what has merit also strongly influences content discussions. See for example... that talk page about that ancient bird... Archeo...whatever, I can look it up if you dunno what I mean. Andy has a habit of dismissing edits or arguments whenever he sees fit: \"You just researched references for ten pages? That doesn't have any merit whatsoever, and neither does your argument that YEC and pro-evolution sites disagree with my claim. So STFU or I ban you.\" - To make things even more screwed up, CP reacted to wandalism by taking away more and more rights. The rights to move articles, upload images, or even edit after Andy went to bed were stripped away and only granted to those Andy trusts. Which simply means that the old sysop criteria are now used as a measure whether you'll be allowed to edit when it's dark in New York. Read: Suck up and bash liberals. That's why people like HelpJazz and Iduan most likely will never get even edit rights. Both of them are highly skilled and dedicated to improve the site, but they don't nod and smile whenever Andy makes insane claims about liberals. - So yeah... the TK case really didn't help (and you'll notice how Andy never commented on this issue in public - TK was simply memory-holed), but the problem is in the system itself. Things have always been terribly screwed up, but over time, it shows more and more clearly. -- [Sid](/wiki/User:Sid)10:16, 14 January 2008 (EST) - Interesting analysis Sid. The system is indeed a huge contributor to the current state of affairs, and I'm sure that Andy's trust began heading down a slope some time ago. The thing is, Andy is the system. Whatever contributes to his general mindset automatically becomes a factor in CP's management. You've highlighted another point in your second bullet: Andy's ego. He'd doesn't want to be judgement of someone's sysop abilities again--one of his mantras seems to be \"I am right, case closed.\" That means he has to be right 100% of the time. So when any of his insiders turns out to be something other than what he expected, it threatens his aura of invincibility because he's been proven wrong in his assessment of someone's ideology. As a result, I think he now wants to be absolutely sure that he only promotes people who are, in his mind, ideologically pure--meaning that they'll \"lose face\" by having to demote anybody. What I find fascinating is that I actually [had edit rights](http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=&page=User%3ABayes)there for a short while (didn't realize it at the time though; no grand announcement was made), and I was nowhere near as dedicated, knowledgeable of the software, and productive as Iduan and HelpJazz appear to be. But then again, that was back in August. I wonder if someone like PJR would get promoted to sysop if he started editing today?-- [Bayes](/wiki/User:Bayes) [update](/wiki/User_talk:Bayes)13:15, 14 January 2008 (EST) - It's actually a very good question whether PJR would get sysop rights on the current CP, especially now that he spoke out on the \"gun control\" article, among other things. - And yes, the ego thing (and the \"Andy needs to be 100% certain\" conclusion you pointed out) certainly explains the sysop promotion for CollegeRepublican. Andy is apparently willing to promote people who didn't do anything on the site as long as he knows he can trust them. - On the flipside, the current sysops are likely quite aware that they will only keep their rights as long as they don't get in Andy's way. At most, they'll voice their opinion, but in the end still bow to AndyTruth. - About edit rights... it's also very odd that, back when he introduced that \"right\", Andy didn't grant it to all active editors. I mean... people who edited there for weeks or months aren't exactly prime candidates when it comes to suddenly abusing a \"right\" they had all the time so far anyway. So the overall effect was actually collective punishment of all people who were suddenly judged to be not worthy of doing what they did so far: Editing CP whenever they saw fit. -- [Sid](/wiki/User:Sid)16:25, 14 January 2008 (EST) Was Iduan a creationist?

Being judged as \"liberal\", arguing with Rob, and that just after joining... \"He's dead, Jim.\" -- - Didn't really follow MexMax and dunno about Iduan's views, but I think that being a creationist certainly helps. Same goes for being against gun control or abortion. The more you openly agree with Andy's views, the better. And if you don't oppose Andy when it comes to topics you disagree with, even better. -- [Sid](/wiki/User:Sid)17:01, 14 January 2008 (EST) Iduan is not a creationist - although if it is him disagreeing with Rob that's a pretty insane reason for them hating him.

It is very frustrating doing research on gun-related crime and all of that. I had to a couple of years ago, and it was damning that the major studies, reputable ones, were so conflicting on if outlawing guns actually did decrease crime. In point of fact the police were actually re-arming themselves due to the wide-spread increase in crime. Statistics can be way too troublesome. -- [TK](/wiki/User:TK) [/MyTalk](/wiki/User_talk:TK)Lowly editor 07:23, 14 January 2008 (EST) - Indeed. One can find and interpret statistics on gun ownership and crime to support either gun control or gun freedom. The only conclusion that seems to be drawn from the endless research is that there are far more factors to take into account and that drawing parallels between different countries (and even different US states) can be fraught with problems. - Instead the arguments appear ideological rather than pragmatic.
