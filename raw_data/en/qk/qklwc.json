Issues like family stress and exhaustion and how they impact heart health and immunity should also be included under this banner. These are complex issues and they can be difficult to manage. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an age-old system that offers holistic diagnosis and care for women's health. Its remedies work with the natural rhythms of your body to correct problems and improve your health overall. Read on to uncover some safe, natural, and gentle tips and strategies that may help support women's health using the wisdom of TCM. Supporting Menstrual Health and Fertility Menstrual health and fertility are important parts of women's health. And often, increasing blood cells is not enough to assure a healthy, comfortable menstrual cycle and continued fertility. TCM is a good solution for this aspect of women's health. It's more holistic than Western solutions because it takes into consideration the whole body, rather than just isolated parts of it. To have regular periods the stomach, spleen, pancreas, liver, hormones, and emotions must work in tandem to digest and absorb nutrients and release sexual hormones at the proper time. Circulation is also important as it ensures the free flow of menstrual blood without complications that might lead to blood deficiency or fibroids. Here's how these systems can impact fertility and what you can do about it: Stomach Health Your stomach needs to \"cook\" the food you eat before it can be properly digested. To do this, it uses digestive enzymes supplied by the liver and digestive acids. If this process is interrupted or not performed properly, you may experience bloating, indigestion, or diarrhea. That's why an exclusively cold, raw diet can actually harm your health. It can lead to inadequate digestive power which ultimately results in blood deficiency and may increase your chances of becoming infertile. In TCM, this is called a \"cold uterus.\" One effective remedy for this is to warm the stomach with ginger or lemon tea. Pancreatic Health The pancreas helps to absorb foods by providing pancreatic acids. A diet of sweets and highly processed foods such as white flour and pasta can damage the pancreas and negatively affect blood sugar levels. You can improve the health of your pancreas by replacing white flour and pasta with healthier options such as whole grains and drying grains like millet, buckwheat, and coix barley. Breast Health The breast, a crowning glory of feminine beauty, is located near the heart which means that the breast is impacted by circulation and emotions. Lumps in the breast may be aggravated by: Chronic stress Excess caffeine use Physical injury Diet of congesting foods (fried, rich, fat foods, alcohol, and especially smoking) So far that applies equally to men since men can develop breast cancers. Emotions A breast issue that sets us apart as women is how our emotions may affect the chest and circulation. Broken heart syndrome is much more common in women than men. Its symptoms resemble heart attack, however, without any problems related to cholesterol. It results from grief and can be fatal. The Liver, Heart, and Circulation Since the liver and heart control muscles and circulation, they play a large role in menstrual comfort, emotional balance, and fertility. When your blood doesn't flow smoothly and your muscles are jammed due to a congesting diet or emotional upset, your period may be late, sparse, clotted or absent.

During these times, many women turn to hormone replacements. These medications can be used to increase or decrease estrogen levels in the body. These types of medications can help you avoid problems associated with unbalanced hormone levels such as arthritis or premature aging. However, hormone replacements can cause side effects such as breast or uterine cancers as well. That's why you should always try to balance your hormones naturally first. This is much safer for and gentler on your body. Some foods and herbs that supply phytoestrogens include: Tofu, tempeh Soybeans and miso Flax seeds Sesame seeds Yucca potato substitute and capsule Dong Quai (aka Tang Kuei) herb Shatavari (Ayurvedic wild asparagus) You can also use natural products to help to block estrogen such as: Wild nettle root, because the root and leaves are antihistamine and cleansing Chrysin, which is a flavonoid found in passionflower, honey, and bee propolis. Maca, which is a cruciferous plant that helps to regulate the hormones and may increase or decrease sexual hormones as needed Blood and Menstrual Issues Even when your menstrual cycle and hormones are healthy, you may still experience problems. Every month, women lose blood because of menstruation. This can lead to a range of symptoms such as: Fatigue Lethargy Poor muscle coordination Nervous issues such as insomnia and irritability Post menopause blood deficiencies can result in the same issues as well as poor skin, hair, and bone quality. The best way to correct this problem is naturally, with foods that increase red blood cell production such as: Red meat like beef Organ meat, such as kidney and liver Dark, leafy, green vegetables like spinach and kale Dried fruits like prunes and raisins Beans Legumes Egg yolks Tonics for Improving Women's Health As a woman, you need to understand how to improve the health of your body as a whole as well as the separate systems that affect women's health.

As your health improves or changes, you will need adjustments to the herbal treatment, and it's important that you not try to make these changes on your own.
