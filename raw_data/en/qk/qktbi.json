Herbal drugs constitute a major share of all the officially recognized system of health in India viz. Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and Naturopathy, except Allopathy. More than 70% of India's 1.1 billion populations still use these non-allopathic systems of medicine. Currently there is no separate category of herbal drugs or dietary supplements, as per the Indian Drugs Act. The common reasons for tilting of common man towards herbal drugs are frustrating side effects and lack of the curative value in modern medicines. The purpose of present study was to document the common traditional medicine practices, assess the local people's preference for traditional medicines (herbal medicine) versus other different systems of medicines and lastly to determine the awareness about the different systems of medicine. Anthropology & Medicine 2004 Social Science & Medicine 2006 Men's pre- and extra-marital sexual behavior has been identified as the primary factor in the growing HIV/STI epidemic among both males and females in India. One major barrier to reaching men has been their underutilization of public health services, which has severely limited programs geared to prevention and early case identification. A significant number of men in India have strong culturally-based sexual health concerns, much of which are derived from \"semen-loss\" and deficiencies in sexual performance. This paper reports on an ongoing Indo-US project that has focused on men's concerns about sexual health problems and assesses the services provided by non-allopaths in three low-income communities in Mumbai. Findings indicate that the primary health resources for these men are private, community-based non-allopaths, who identify themselves as ayurvedic, unani and homeopathic providers. The paper suggests that the combination of strong culturally-based sexual health concerns and the presence of private non-allopaths who manage these problems present a window of opportunity for intervention programs to address the challenge of HIV/STI prevention and early case identification in India. International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology In the modern world, living beings are suffering from various kinds of diseases due to their lifestyle habits. Today, medicine is the first aid preferred for every disease. The usage of medicine is being practiced from prehistoric times to the present. It is an ancient thought of development in the medical world. Human beings believed that medicines have the capacity to regulate diseases and it devotes to health and well-being of patients. The medical field is constantly making tremendous changes in the progress of medicines, thereby curing many dangerous diseases and save the lives of many human beings. This article focuses on the importance of medicine, and gives a comparison between Allopathy, Homeopathy and Ayurveda. This book is the result of many minds, hearts, and souls who have shared a vision of healing with me. It would not exist without them. It began when Lance Sholdt, then at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, asked if I would work with him to put together a course in complementary and alternative medicine for the medical students. His careful construction of this course helped us outline the contents of the book. This book is the brainchild of Jeff Levin. He was the first to suggest that a textbook like this was needed and could be written. His heartfelt work and attention to detail kept things moving when I was bogged down. Janette Carlucci is the soul of the book, managing both the special features and the day-to-day contact with the many authors. To her, a special thanks on this journey. Ron Chez provided a much needed balance for the book. He was always ready and willing to assist with a critical eye and keep us anchored to how this book could be of benefit for patients. I would also like to thank the editors, Jane Velker, Beth Goldner, and Joyce Murphy, for understanding the complexity of the topic and for a commitment to quality over deadlines. And Tim Hiscock for finally saying that we were going to press\u2014 ready or not. I would just as soon have worked another three years on it as finish.
