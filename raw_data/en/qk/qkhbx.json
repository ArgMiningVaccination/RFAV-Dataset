Please be seated. 15 DIRECT EXAMINATION 16 BY MS. BABCOCK: 17 Q Good morning, Dr. Rima. 18 A Good morning. 19 Q Would you please state and spell your name 20 for the record? 21 A Okay. My name is Bertus, B -E-R-T-U-S, 22 Karel, K -A-R-E-L, Rima, R -I-M-A. 23 Q And what is your profession? 24 A I'm a virologist. 25 Q Now could you briefly describe your Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 6 of 204 825 RIMA - DIRECT 1 collegiate and graduate education? 2 A I was educated as a c hemical engineer in 3 Delft, the Netherlands, and graduated there in 1970 4 with what was the Anglo -Saxon equivalent of an MSC, 5 specializing in bacterial genetics. I then went to do 6 a PhD in Canada for five years in bacterial genetics 7 and then went to Dublin and to Belfast and wanted to 8 do postdoctoral work on measles virus. And I have 9 stayed there ever since and p rogressed through the 10 ranks. 11 Q And where are you at currently? The Queens 12 University of Belfast? 13 A Queens University, Belfast, yes. 14 Q And what is your position there? 15 A I am head of the School of Biomedical 16 Sciences. And at the moment, I am involved in the 17 reorganization of the medical f aculty with a person 18 who was in my school and now is the head of the School 19 of Medicine and Dentistry. So I'm involved, 20 essentially involved, in reorganizing the whole of the 21 medical faculty there. 22 Q Now do you also teach? 23 A I do both at undergraduate level as well as 24 postgraduate level, although with the amount of 25 administra tion that I do at the moment, the amount of Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 7 of 204 826A RIMA - DIRECT 1 undergraduate teaching I do is relatively limited. 2 But I do still have about seven postgraduate students 3 in my lab. 4 Q And you alluded to it earlier, but what has 5 been the primary focus of your research, the literary 6 research? 7 A The primary focus of my research has been 8 paramyxoviruses and particularly neurovirology of 9 measles. Canine distemper and mumps virus is more or 10 less what I do at the moment as well as the 11 pathogenesis of these viruses. So that is the main 12 focus of my work at the moment. 13 I have been in measles virus work for about 14 33 years and started that off with the original SDS - 15 PAGE gel to look at proteins. We went through RNA, 16 the cloning and sequencing phase, PCR phase. And 17 essentially we are now focusing more on the 18 pathogenesis of the virus. 19 Q And about how many arti cles have you 20 published on measles virus? 21 A I haven't counted them accurately, but it 22 must be well over 100, plus a substantial number of 23 articles on canine distemp er as well as on mumps. 24 Q And you've also written book chapters and 25 other publications? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 8 of 204 827A RIMA - DIRECT 1 A I have, yes, about 20 odd book chapters. I 2 am responsible primarily for the Encyclopedia of 3 Virology in mumps as well as the author of textbooks 4 in medicine on mumps as well. 5 Q And have you been an invited to lecturer or 6 given talks on measles? 7 A Oh, yes, quite a few times. Twenty, 30 8 times at least. And I've been involved in a number of 9 evaluations and WHO groups to look at measles 10 vaccination as well. 11 Q You also review scientific papers for 12 journals? 13 A I do. It's a matter of trying to limit 14 that, but I certainly will do one a week. 15 Q Okay. So that's about 52 a year? 16 A About 50 a year, yes. 17 Q Okay. Are you currently or have you ever 18 been on the editorial board of journals that might be 19 relevant to the litigation here? 20 A Yes. I'm on the editorial board of the 21 Archives of Virology, which is a relatively low - 22 ranking journal. I have been 15 years on the 23 editorial board of the Journal of General Virology, 24 which is about the third -ranked in the world, the most 25 prominent European journal. I've been editor of that Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 9 of 204 828 RIMA - DIRECT 1 for five years, and I'm s till on the board. And I've 2 been invited just to join the editorial board of the 3 Journal of Virology, the ASM Journal. 4 Q And do you sit on any research panels? 5 A Not at the moment. I have sat on quite a 6 lot of panels in the past, but I just simply don't 7 have the time to sit on grant panels at the moment. 8 Q Do you have any learning society 9 memberships? And just the most important ones that 10 would be relevant to us here. 11 A Yes. I'm a member of the Society for 12 General Microbiology where I am also on the council of 13 the organization. That's a large -membership 14 organization, about 5,000 members in the U.K. and 15 Europe. And I am a me mber of the American Society for 16 Microbiology. 17 Q And you were an expert in the U.K. MMR 18 litigation, correct? 19 A I was, yes. 20 Q So it's fair to say you've spent a 21 substantial amount of time working on that litigation? 22 A I did. I was asked to come on board and 23 work with the lawyers who represented the respondents 24 in those cases, which were the vaccine manufacturers. 25 I was asked in late 1999 or early 2000, I can't Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 10 of 204 829A RIMA - DIRECT 1 remember, and I worked for over five years on that, 2 with different levels of intensity obviously because 3 the case took off slowly. And then in 2003, we had to 4 produce expert reports. But I was very much involved 5 in the earlier stages of that work, trying to bring 6 the legal teams up t o speed in measles virology. 7 Q And as you just stated, you produced an 8 expert report for that. 9 A I did. It is a two -pronged report which 10 since has been redacted and has been made available to 11 the Court here. The first part is essentially very 12 much a general description, which I think is 13 noncontroversial as i t's simply to educate people. 14 The second prong is really much more focused on my 15 assessment of the claims for presence of measles virus 16 in tissues of various claimants. 17 Q About how much were you paid for your time? 18 A I was paid about $160,000. 19 Q And of that, how much of that went to your 20 academic institution for scientific research? 21 A After tax, I donated half of the proceeds of 22 this to my academic institution. 23 Q And before today, how many times have you 24 testified in a legal proceeding? 25 A I've never testified. As you know, the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 11 of 204 830A RIMA - DIRECT 1 McCabe case never came to court. 2 THE COURT: As we said to Dr. McCabe, 3 welcome. 4 THE WITNESS: Thank you. 5 BY MS. BABCOCK: 6 Q Did you review the Snyder case materials in 7 preparing your report? 8 A I did. 9 Q And by your report, I'm referring actually 10 to what we may have called the supplemental report 11 from you, because obviously the UK report was prepared 12 for the ligitation there. 13 Did you also review any materi als from 14 Cedillo? 15 A I did. And obviously I submitted an 16 affidavit in that particular case. That affidavit was 17 terminated by a statement which essentially said tha t 18 I wished to revise my opinion if indeed I will be 19 allowed to talk more about what I had seen and what I 20 had experienced in the case. And luckily, because of 21 the redacted report now being available, I can now 22 make a complete disclosure of the content of my 23 report, which obviously was more extensive than the 24 affidavit you have in the Cedill o case. 25 Q And have you been present to hear the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 12 of 204 831 RIMA - DIRECT 1 testimony of Dr. Kennedy and Dr. Kinsbourne in this 2 proceeding? 3 A I have. 4 Q Now, during Cedillo and in this case, there 5 was a fair bit of discussion about immune changes that 6 are observed after a measles virus infection 7 vaccination. Actually it was after a measles virus 8 infection, and then t here was an effort to extrapolate 9 those immune changes to the MMR vaccine. Based on 10 your research and knowledge, are there any clinically 11 relevant immune changes following MMR? 12 A Well, I'm obviously not a physician. I'm 13 not as involved in this, but actually I've studied 14 this field quite a lot and I have never seen any 15 clinically relevant immunosuppressi on after 16 vaccination. 17 Q And can you briefly describe with MMR the 18 attenuation process that results in the MMR vaccine 19 for measles? 20 A Well, obviously there's three components, 21 and I don't know whether you wish me to go through all 22 three of them. Certainly in the case of rubella, I 23 would be a bit shaky on the actual process that has 24 taken place. 25 But as far as the measles virus is Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 13 of 204 832A RIMA - DIRECT 1 concerned, it was passed through a number. You had 2 first of all monkey kidney cells. And then 3 esse ntially this process culminated in a number of 4 passages in chicken embryo fibroblasts. And the virus 5 occasionally is grown by some manufacturers in eggs. 6 Q And is it fair to say that the intent of the 7 attenuation process is to make the virus less 8 virulent? 9 A Yes, although that is measured in a very 10 pragmatic sense in terms of the ability of the virus 11 upon infection in human beings to cause clinical 12 symptoms. So the actual molecular knowledge that we 13 have doesn't really allow us to identify at this 14 particular time which mutations are relevant. We 15 certainly know a large number of mutations that have 16 occurred during a particular attenuation process, but 17 we are not able at this stage to say this is the 18 important mutation that makes a particular virus 19 attenuate. But that's part of a very large research 20 program that I've been involved in. 21 Q Is it fair to say that the current 22 formulation of MMR is an attenuated version of the 23 Edmonston strain? 24 A It is. All measles vaccines used in the 25 world come from that particular strain. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 14 of 204 833A RIMA - DIRECT 1 Q Which of the clinical findings -- and again, 2 realizing that you're not a medical doctor -- but of 3 wild measles virus infections do we typically see, if 4 any, following MMR? 5 A The only one that is indicated and occurs is 6 the thrombocytopenia at a very low rate. But that is 7 rare and it is transient, but that's about i t. There 8 is a certain amount of fever in some of the children, 9 but that is the main aspect. 10 When the original virus was put on the 11 market, the Edmonston virus wa s not that well 12 attenuated, and a more attenuated vaccine has been 13 developed since. And that particular vaccine, the 14 original vaccine actually still shows the occasional 15 K oplik spots, but that is no longer the case now. And 16 essentially what we see is a situation that fever is 17 practically the only sort of clinical symptom that we 18 see. 19 Q For about how long has this new vaccine you 20 said is the more attenuated version, how long has that 21 one been commonly administered in the United 22 States? 23 A I think that must have come out late '60s, 24 early '70s. I don't know exactly when it came to the 25 U.S. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 15 of 204 834A RIMA - DIRECT 1 Q But quite some time? 2 A This is a long time. 3 Q Is pharyngitis a recognized reaction to the 4 MMR vaccine? 5 A (Nonverbal response.) 6 Q Is otitis media a recognized reaction to the 7 MMR vaccine? 8 A Of the vaccine, no. That is with the wild 9 type. 10 Q Has the MMR vaccine ever been associated 11 with SSPE? 12 A It ha s not. 13 Q What about MIBE? 14 A There are two cases in the literature that 15 I'm aware of, the Bidmun case which was referred to 16 earlier in the week by Dr. Kenned y. And that turned 17 out to be -- sorry? 18 Q Could I just clarify, I think it was Dr. 19 Kinsbourne. 20 A Sorry, sorry, yes. And that's the case in 21 which the child turned out to be immunosuppressed and 22 had an immune deficiency, although that wasn't 23 recognized at the time. That child throughout the 24 decades has been well described in the literature. 25 The second case is one that we have Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 16 of 204 835A RIMA - DIRECT 1 identified about 30 years ago in Belfast with a child 2 who had received the Schwarz vaccine, which is the 3 same as the variety and strength in a more attenuated 4 vaccine. And in that case, the child died of giant 5 cell pneumonia but had infection in the brain and in 6 all the tissue s that we looked at. So those are two 7 cases I know of. 8 Q Sure. Can I back up to Bitmun for a minute? 9 You said there was immune suppression? Are we talking 10 about mild immunosuppression, or was this 11 a significant -- 12 A No, in the case of the Bidman case, I don't 13 know. I can't remember when the actual immune 14 deficiency was identified. 15 Q But it was significant? 16 A It was. And in the case of the second case 17 that I described, this child had -- anemia, so I 18 couldn't make out accurately. 19 Q And that child died. 20 A So these were essentially unrecognized 21 immunodeficient children which should not have been 22 vaccinated but were obviously. 23 Q Okay. And I just need to make this clear 24 now. By unrecognized immune deficient, the postulate 25 here is that to some extent, there might have been Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 17 of 204 836A RIMA - DIRECT 1 some unrecognized immune deficiency. We're talking 2 about far more significant. 3 A Oh, yes. Definitely in the Belfast case. 4 In the virus in the Bitmun, it was less well 5 described. 6 Q Now you described acute disseminated 7 encephalomyelitis in your report. 8 A Uh -huh. 9 Q What viruses have, you cal l it ADE, we 10 usually refer to it as ADEM, been associated with? 11 A The viruses that can cause that are 12 measles/mumps/rubella, vaccinia, varicella and 13 influenza. The re are some classical mumps with which 14 that has been associated on occasion. 15 Q So a number of different viruses. 16 A Yes. 17 Q Has measles virus ever been shown to be in 18 the brain of children affected by this condition? 19 A No, it hasn't. But obviously studies are 20 quite limited because it is not often fatal. And in 21 that sense, it is a situation where there's not a 22 large number of material available. But in those 23 cases that have been looked at, we haven't been able 24 to find it. 25 Q So, no? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 18 of 204 837A RIMA - DIRECT 1 A The answer is it always difficult in science 2 to prove the absence of something. There is no 3 evidence for it, but that doesn't mean that it isn't 4 there. In essenc e, because the general opinion in the 5 field is that there is some form of an immune reaction 6 that is set off and essentially leads to a reaction 7 that is manifesting itself as encephalitis. 8 Q Now is measles an RNA virus or a DNA virus? 9 A It's an RNA virus. 10 Q Which is more stable? 11 A The DNA is much more stable. I mean, that's 12 well -demonstrated. In fact, we can look at the -- 13 DNA, or we certainly could look at the -- RNA, it's so 14 unstable that essentially the viruses need to be able 15 to replicate constantly in order to maintain 16 themselves. And that's where there is a substantial 17 difference in terms of persistence between DNA viruses 18 and RNA viruses. 19 Q So it's possible for a DNA virus to remain 20 in a latent state for a lengthy period of time. 21 A Yes. Oh, yes. That's very well actually 22 demonstrated in the ca se of shingles in the elderly 23 who have had chicken pox in the very early, much 24 earlier stage of the virus stage, which you rely on 25 viruses like -- but cold sores and Epstein -Barr -- Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 19 of 204 838A RIMA - DIRECT 1 Q But with an RNA virus such as measles, it 2 needs to be replicating? 3 A It needs to be replicating, and so in that 4 sense, it's not considered a latent virus. There is 5 an active replication process that needs to be there 6 to sustain the virus throughout the period of 7 symptoms. I think this is particularly in the case of 8 SSPE where that's about eight years. We do need to 9 recognize that there is a time that that virus has to 10 replicate in order to be able to maintain itself. 11 Q Now Dr. Ke nnedy discusses an R protein in 12 his report, contending that it's produced by ribosomal 13 frameshifting? 14 A Uh -huh. 15 Q Does this protein exist in measles virus? 16 A No, I've never heard of it. I've been 33 17 years in the field, attended all the conferences on 18 measles, and I've never heard of this. Ribosomal 19 frameshifting is a process that does occur in other 20 RNA viruses but not in measles. 21 Q And Dr. Kennedy also stated in his slides on 22 Tuesday that CD46 was the primary receptor for the 23 vaccine wild type measles virus. Do you agree? 24 A I don't. Its main receptor is CD150 or 25 SLAM. And even I refer to the paper that we have that Heritage Reporting Corporatio n (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 20 of 204 839A RIMA - DIRECT 1 was produced in Belfast in this vaccine case, which 2 essentially is a little bit alike in that even in that 3 case, we are at this moment looking at the 4 distribution of the virus in this child's tissues 5 which are still available to us. And even in that 6 case, the virus is still entirely limited to the 7 lymphopickering (ph) system. 8 Q Now Dr. Kennedy also discussed a high -titer 9 measles virus in his report, suggesting that the 10 increased mortality in girls could be due to the viral 11 persistence and with immune factors at play. I think 12 we've already established that that's not a vaccine 13 that's ever been administered in the United States, 14 but are you personally familiar with these vaccination 15 trials? 16 A Yes. I mean, I was part of the review group 17 that WHO put together in order to look at that 18 particular issue in 1992. And we had to come to the 19 conclusion that there was indeed an unexplained higher 20 risk for gi rls to die after the administration of this 21 vaccine. 22 That particular evaluation was an 23 interesting one in the sense that if you put the two 24 genders together, the effect was just simply on the 25 statistical borderline. We were really quite unclear Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 21 of 204 840A RIMA - DIRECT 1 and unsure as to whether or not there was a real 2 effect or not, because this was looking cl osely at 3 cases that had occurred in various countries, and the 4 studies had been replicated in a number of cases in 5 countries. 6 And essentially you couldn't define 7 exclusion criteria after the fact. So there were 8 falls, there were traffic accidents, there was 9 anything. We couldn't really exclude anything. But 10 nevertheless, it was clear and it was replicated that 11 in girls, there was this excess mortality. And so the 12 WHO decided that these trials with high titer vaccines 13 should be discontinue d. 14 The main reason for them having to try and 15 go into the children at an earlier stage with the 16 vaccine is so that there is this window of opportunity 17 for the vir us to maintain itself. That is caused by 18 the fact that at some stage, children lose the 19 maternal antibody that they get. 20 If you then do a vaccination program at too 21 early a stage, you end up in a situation where a large 22 number of children simply have too much maternal 23 antibody left for them to get the good thing from that 24 vaccine. And so you have to w ait with your program 25 until a time that the maternal antibody level has Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 22 of 204 841A RIMA - DIRECT 1 waned in almost all the children. 2 And so what we found was essentially that 3 that needed to be 12 to 15 months. But what was tried 4 was to go in with a higher titre vaccine from the 5 remnants of that maternal antibody. So that was the 6 idea behind it. And I think it was quite a sensible 7 idea, but at the same time, when this effect was noted 8 and replicated in other countries, there was really no 9 option but to stop the trial. 10 Q So do you think it's appropriate to 11 extrapolate and suggest that the reason that this 12 might have existed were because of immune dysfunction? 13 A No. I mean, there's been several attempts 14 to try to look at what the reason behind this is. And 15 essentially studies have been attempted, but none have 16 been able to be conclusive as to what happens in those 17 cases. And these cases hav e been followed up for 18 several years afterwards. 19 Q What are the measles antibody levels you see 20 in the CSF of patients with SSPE? 21 A The antibody levels in S SPE are extremely 22 high, and that is primarily based on the fact that 23 there are resident B cells in the brain which start to 24 make antibody that is measles -specific. And this 25 leads to the situation where in SSPE, you have Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 23 of 204 842A RIMA - DIRECT 1 oligoclonal bands that are the products of a set. A 2 small set of B cells make these antibodies and have 3 been put there in very, very high levels in the CSF of 4 SSPE patients. 5 Q And with SSPE, does measles virus affect 6 some areas of the brain and not others? 7 A No, it doesn't. It is diffuse, although we 8 can show anatomical spreads, that it's spreading both 9 through the sinus and also -- 10 Q So it affects -- I'm sorry, you may 11 continue. 12 A So rry? 13 Q So it affects everything? 14 A Yes. It's diffuse throughout the brain. 15 Q Any evidence it causes altered cytokine 16 levels? 17 A No really very good evidence, no. 18 Q Can you briefly discuss the clinical 19 symptoms of someone with SSPE and MIBE. 20 A Well, it starts off usually with deficits in 21 attention, difficulty to concentrate and usually is 22 followed very quickly by degeneration, and there are 23 four different stages recognized. And in the final 24 stage, the children lapse off into coma. Death 25 follows almost invariably. But there are stages with Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 24 of 204 843A RIMA - DIRECT 1 seizures and seizures in various levels in between 2 that that form a relatively well -defined staging of 3 the process. 4 Q And have you ever had occasion to work with 5 Andrew Wakefield? 6 A I did. As you can imagine, I worked on 7 measles for about 15 years before Andy started. And I 8 was quite interested. As a person who was interested 9 in the sequelae of measles, I was quite interested to 10 see what h e had to say about the work in laboratories 11 on viral disease. And so in 1992, I attended the 12 first meeting with him where we had a number of 13 measles virologists come together with him to look at 14 material that he had produced. 15 And he was essentially asking the opinion of 16 a number of people who were fairly well -respected and 17 had had long experience in th is field to see what they 18 made of the claims. And I attended two of these 19 meetings I think, and I came to the conclusion that 20 whatever material was put in front of me was highly 21 selective. When criticisms were made, they were not 22 followed up. 23 So I was confronted with so -called measles 24 viruses inside the cell which essentially turned out 25 to be clathrin -coated pits and not measles virus, Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 25 of 204 844A RIMA - DIRECT 1 which I pointed out. The size wasn't right. That 2 sort of thing developed into a situation where I 3 became somewhat frustr ated by the fact that criticism 4 that was leveled at the data that we were shown really 5 wasn't followed up. 6 And then essentially in 1995, we had a 7 situation where one of his MD students produced an 8 abstract for a meeting that I was attending and asked 9 me whether I wanted to be coauthor on it and I asked 10 so, first of all, I would like to ask what the data 11 were. And when data were presented to me in terms of 12 sequence analysis, one of Andy's students told me that 13 essentially it wasn't the Edmonston strain but that it 14 was bec ause it had the same simple single mutation in 15 a particular position. 16 And I said, well, that's interesting because 17 that was exactly a mutation which is present in the 18 clone that I sent you, and so essentially that would 19 have indicated contamination at that time. And when 20 that wasn't retracted, then I formally withdrew my 21 collaboration with Andy Wakefield. 22 And so I have been since 1995 involved in 23 first of all looking from a different perspective of 24 his at his claims for the involvement of me asles in 25 infecting inflammatory bowel disease, which was a Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 26 of 204 845A RIMA - DIRECT 1 difficult period because it changed. We had notices 2 all the time in strains of measles, wild -type measles 3 viruses to vaccine measles viruses to measles and 4 mumps in the same year. It was a very difficult time. 5 In '92, which is in my CV, it led to a 6 situation where in 1998 I think, '99, I can't remember 7 exactly, the Medical Research Council in the U.K. 8 convened a meeting in which essentially we had 9 hearings with Andy and several experts in the field. 10 The general conclusion of everyone present was that 11 there really was no substance to the claim that 12 measles vaccine or measles virus was involved in the 13 actual infectious bowel disease syndrome that he 14 described. The only person that didn't agree was Andy 15 Wakefield, and at that time, he had started to work on 16 the autism case, but I wasn't aware of that. 17 Q So, just to summarize it, you had an 18 instance where you worked with him, you identified 19 concerns. Because of that, you didn't work with him 20 any longer. 21 A Well, yes. I mean, my main concern was a 22 rather difficult situation where I found that the 23 criticisms I made were not acted upon. Then 24 essentially you have to stop the collaboration, as 25 several others have had to do as well. I mean, there Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 27 of 204 846A RIMA - DIRECT 1 were people from the Westbury Group, a very well -known 2 group working with measles. They were involved with 3 Andy at the same time, and they withdrew from that 4 collaboration as well. So it involved my other 5 colleagues. 6 Q Switching gears, have you ever heard Paul 7 Dyken? 8 A No, I hadn't, not until I came here. 9 Q Okay. And switching gears again, now on to 10 the Uhlmann paper. This topic has been covered in 11 quite some depth, and so we will certainly attempt not 12 to duplicate what was already presented in Cedillo. 13 Is it safe to say that you have identified a number of 14 concerns with the Uhlmann paper? 15 A With the Uhlmann paper, yes. I mean, pa rt 16 of that is in my original affidavit in the Cedillo 17 case and is read very well and extensively criticized 18 in my redacted report that's available to the Court. 19 Q How much confidence do you have in the 20 reported results based on those concerns? 21 A I have no confidence whatsoever. 22 Q Now Dr. Kennedy takes issue w ith Dr. 23 Bustin's observation of a C -to-T substitution in the 24 F -gene probe in the Uhlmann paper, asserting that this 25 was done for purposes of allelic discrimination. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 28 of 204 847 RIMA - DIRECT 1 A Uh -huh. 2 Q Can you just explain quickly what allelic 3 discrimination is? 4 A Okay. I think it's best if we would go to 5 the last slide that I had. 6 THE COURT: All right. At this point, can 7 we get these marked? 8 MS. BABCOCK: I'm sorry. Would it be 9 Respondent's Trial Exhibit 4? 10 THE COURT: It would be. 11 (The document referred to was 12 marked for identification as 13 Respondent's Trial Exhib it 14 No. 4.) 15 THE COURT: And are those slides numbered? 16 MS. BABCOCK: Yes. 17 THE COURT: Okay. 18 MS. BABCOCK: So we are on page 9. 19 THE WITNESS: Okay. So -- 20 BY MS. BABCOCK: 21 Q Well, let me set the groundwork here. I'm 22 just wanting in general what is allelic 23 discrimination. We'll discuss it in more detail 24 later. 25 A Okay. Well, allelic discrimination is a Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 29 of 204 848A RIMA - DIRECT 1 test that's been devised to see whether people are 2 having in their DNA largely just a copy of the same 3 allele, the same sequence, or whether there is a 4 mutation involving the parental chromosomes or whether 5 most of them are of the second allele, and I have 6 described that in my report. 7 It is a technology which works quite well 8 when you have two 50/50 of DNA, with 50 on one allele 9 and 50 percent on the other allele. Unfortunately, 10 the Unigenetics Lab started to apply this to RNA work 11 under conditions which are essentially experimental 12 and which I can easily demonstrate to you that they 13 actually failed to develop a proper test. 14 Q And we will get to that? 15 A We will get to that. 16 Q This is just for purposes of I wanted to see 17 when I'm asking questions about whether the suggestion 18 of the C -to-T substitution was done for purposes of 19 allelic discrimination. 20 A Oh, it wasn't an allele. In fact, it was 21 clearly a mistake. There is nothing in the Uhlmann 22 paper that deals with allelic exclusion. 23 Q Okay. Were there other techniques used in 24 Uhlmann like solution -based RT PCR? 25 A Yes. There were essentially four techniques Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 30 of 204 849A RIMA - DIRECT 1 used in that paper. Solution -based RT PCR, which is 2 an standard technology. There was in situ RT PCR, 3 which was an experimental technology which in my 4 opinion they failed to develop properly. And then 5 there was obviously the background data. Those were 6 the main technologie s used. 7 Q What is immunocytochemistry? 8 A Immunocytochemistry is a technique that is 9 used in order to demonstrate the protein of a 10 particular virus in a part icular tissue. Essentially, 11 what it does is that binds an antibody to that 12 particular protein to the tissue with a large number 13 of controls. Then we add a secondary antibody to the 14 infected antibody to see whether a particular protein 15 of a virus is present in that tissue or not. And that 16 technique was not used in the Uhlmann paper. 17 Q You answered my question, which is great. 18 We'll move on to Unigenetics. Obviously, in your 19 report, as part of your work in the U.K. MMR 20 litigation, you had the o pportunity to examine the 21 tests and records used by the O'Leary Lab? 22 A What I had looked at, I must say I find 23 myself in a somewhat difficult position, and if I may 24 explain that to the Court. Obviously, my redacted 25 report is available, but there is obviously a large Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 31 of 204 850A RIMA - DIRECT 1 amount of background material that I have looked at 2 but which I am not at liberty to discuss with you. 3 Nevertheless, my experience is described in 4 the report, and it's based on having looked at that 5 very substantial amount of material, which involves 6 probably around 300 samples that we looked at in the 7 U.K. litigation of controls as well as claims. 8 So, in essence, I have to be careful about 9 how far I go into disclosing particular material. 10 That is unfortunately the situation. But what is a 11 very big difference between the situation that I find 12 here and the U.K. litigation, the data that were 13 available to me in th e U.K. case would have been the 14 top sheet or the headline figure that is the number of 15 copies of measles F gene. It would be in some cases 16 simply a number of copies. In some cases, the number 17 of copies per nanogram of RNA, so a computation had 18 taken place. 19 And I would have also then seen the actual 20 data for the cell cycle number at which the -- would 21 have had the circled CT number that -- I looked at and 22 described in detail. And for each of the samples in 23 that particular run as well, I would have seen the 24 laboratory pa ges that would have indicated how the RNA 25 was extracted and how successful that would be. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 32 of 204 851A RIMA - DIRECT 1 Q So you're saying that the clinic's efforts 2 in the U.K. proved their case. They provided you with 3 a lot more information on the testing that was done. 4 A Data, yes. 5 Q Obviously, Colten Snyder wasn't a part of 6 the U.K. litigation, but nevertheless, we don't have 7 that information here. 8 A No, we don't. 9 Q Nor should I say we would have any 10 information in the Michelle Cedillo case. 11 A N o, the same applies. The only thing that 12 we have here is the number of copies. 13 Q And you've read materials presented by 14 Stephen Bustin in Cedillo and in his testimony. 15 A I did, yes. 16 Q And again, I assure you that as a result of 17 that, we will not be going through how PCR is done and 18 some of the more technical details, becaus e that was 19 very technical, but we also need to cover some issues 20 with you, Dr. Rima. 21 You've also read the rebuttal opinions filed 22 by Dr. Kennedy and Dr. Hepner in Cedillo. 23 A I have. 24 Q During your career, have you developed 25 // Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 33 of 204 852A RIMA - DIRECT 1 expertise on PCR techniques. 2 A Yes. I mean, as soon as it came out, it 3 became quite clear this was a very, very powerful 4 technique. What wasn't immediately recognized, and 5 this was not until a substantial number of situations 6 in literature whi ch involved data that had to be 7 rectified, was how powerful the technique actually 8 was. And certainly the experience of all of us in the 9 particular effect of using the technique is that it 10 can pick up one copy or one molecule of DNA for a 11 specific titer quite easily. 12 The RNA is a little bit less sensitive 13 because you have to do this reversion scripting. 14 That's the conversion of the RNA into DNA. That in 15 itself is additional multiplications in the whole 16 process. That's a situation where RNA is actually a 17 little bit harder to detect. This is an area where I 18 would have taken some issue with while Dr. Kennedy 19 described immunization through the discussion you 20 had -- in relation to the contamination issues in 21 relation to the -- interactions. 22 (Electronic interference.) 23 A RNA actually, it is more difficult to pick 24 up RNA in a lab, and even if you've got a virus and if 25 you are in a laboratory which has a large number of Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 34 of 204 852B RIMA - DIRECT 1 plasmids around, which are used in order to make 2 standard RNA for the PCR tes ts. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 35 of 204 853A RIMA - DIRECT 1 So I would observe that it is a difficult 2 situation to prove to anyone, but if you ask me what 3 is the most difficult situation, it's that if you have 4 in yo ur laboratory a large number of plasmids that are 5 of a particular virus, then you have a much greater 6 chance of contamination than if you have the actual 7 virus itself. 8 Q Were there plasmids at Unigenetics? 9 A Yes. They made them. They grew them in 10 order to make standard RNA's for their standards 11 curves in assays. 12 Q Did you visit the Unigenetics Laboratory? 13 A Yes, on two occasions. The first time 14 primarily to look at the IS RT PCR data. 15 Q Which IS stands for? 16 A The in situ RT PCR. And I was allowed into 17 a small room. Maybe I was a naive scientist at the 18 time, not having been involved in any legal cases at 19 all, and esse ntially ended up in a situation where I 20 thought, well, I'm going there and I'll talk this over 21 with John O'Leary and see what we can come up with. 22 But the only contact I had with John O'Leary 23 was he came in the room and read me a legal statement 24 and said he couldn't talk to me. I said okay. Then I 25 just simply looked at the slides myself. And my only Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 36 of 204 854A RIMA - DIRECT 1 interaction was with Dr. Shiels, who whenever I said, 2 look, I don't see what it is I'm supposed to see in 3 this particular slide and I see in this red circled 4 area which you say is positive, I see exactly the same 5 outside that red circled area, the only response I 6 got, he said, well, this was Dr. O'Leary's invitation. 7 So we couldn't really discuss this any further. 8 But being mindful of the fact that we were 9 then getting into a legal situation, I ended up saying 10 to the solicitors that acted for the respondents, 11 well, I'm not a pathologist, so it would be very easy 12 to say in court that what I saw was of course simply 13 based on inexperience in the situation. 14 So I then went b ack a second time with Dr. 15 McDonald, who I understand has testified to the Court, 16 essentially to look at IS RT PCR and Tom I think also 17 he took quite a few slides home with him in order to 18 photograph them, and I hope you are aware of that. I 19 haven't read the transcript of his testimony, but I 20 assume that's the area that was covered. 21 Q Certainly. So it's safe to say you did 22 review the Unigenetics of data? 23 A I did that directly in the IS RT PCR. I 24 mean, the -- data, I obviously reviewed what I already 25 said, the material that was disclosed to us in the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 37 of 204 854B RIMA - DIRECT 1 U.K. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 38 of 204 855A RIMA - DIRECT 1 litigation and presented through the allelic 2 discrimination assay. 3 Q Now Dr. Bustin during his t estimony and in 4 his written report discussed concern with the 5 laboratory notebooks. 6 A Uh -huh. 7 Q He discussed one example in particular. An 8 attempt has been made to adjust that the problem, this 9 problem he identified, was an isolated problem and was 10 later corrected. Was this your experience in review 11 or your kn owledge of that particular lab notebook? 12 A In terms of the lab notebooks, I have seen 13 that particular alteration that has taken place, the 14 fact that after P28 full stop, material was ad ded 15 later on. Because we didn't get too many cases in 16 which particular samples were disputed or where 17 particular samples were repeated, I haven't been able 18 to myself see a ny further instances of direct notebook 19 alterations of that kind, okay? So that thought in 20 regard to a first look at the evidence in this case, 21 that's the only evidence that I have seen of tha t 22 particular instance of the alteration of lab 23 notebooks. 24 Q Based on your knowledge of that particular 25 // Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 39 of 204 856A RIMA - DIRECT 1 one, the circumstances, d o you think it was later 2 corrected? Do you buy the explanation that was 3 offered in the rebuttal for the lab notebooks? 4 A It was clearly later corrected. In the U.K. 5 case, we had one submission of that notebook and it 6 came back into the second submission, and then there 7 was an alteration. 8 Q Now we have the slide up actually about 9 allelic discrimination. A claim has been made they 10 were able to determine whether the measle virus they 11 were identifying is the wild type or vaccine strain? 12 A Yes. 13 Q Based on your review, do you think they were 14 reliably differentiating between vaccine strain and 15 wild -type measles virus? 16 A No, they weren't, and I think this is very 17 extensively dealt with in my report. But I have had 18 direct discussions with Orla Shiels about the way in 19 which he did that, because it wasn't very clear from 20 the material that had been disclosed to us how that 21 particular test worked. But if I may take the 22 opportunity to show a diagram that is in my report? 23 Q Just one moment. I'm just going to say this 24 is in color at one point, because you'll see according 25 to the legend, different colors are supposed to Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 40 of 204 857A RIMA - DIRECT 1 represent different things. We may ask leave of the 2 Court to later file a color version so it will be 3 easier to understand. 4 A Okay. Is this in color? 5 Q It's tough to tell. 6 A Okay. I need to see some colors. 7 Q What I need you to explain is why this does 8 not give you confidence in allelic discrimination 9 assays. 10 A Okay. Well, the assay works as follows. 11 There are two probes in the RT PCR, one that can 12 interact with DNA that is coming from the vaccines if 13 there was a vaccine present in a p articular sample and 14 one that can interact with DNA that would be amplified 15 from wild vaccines. And this gives rise to two 16 different fluorescence values, which are measured in 17 the \"Y\" axis or the \"X\" axis. 18 And so the assay is set up in the following 19 way. A number of tests are being done on material 20 that has been spiked with DNA, actually RNA that is 21 contained in the vaccine sequence. There are also a 22 number of tests that are set up in blue here if you 23 can see it that are spiked with RNA that contains the 24 wild vaccines. 25 THE COURT: All right. Doctor, I want you Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 41 of 204 858A RIMA - DIRECT 1 to stop for a minute and describe where on the slides 2 you were using your pointer for the vaccine strain and 3 for the wild -type strain. 4 THE WITNESS: The vaccine tests material 5 would be these right here. 6 THE COURT: And that would be the upper 7 right part of the lower right square. 8 THE WITNESS: It is indeed here, yes. So a 9 cutoff point is defined in that test. Based on the 10 highest point in this set where the vaccine is spiked 11 with the samples, a nd the value of that is determining 12 where you make the cutoff between the vaccine and wild 13 vaccines. 14 THE COURT: And by that, you mean the line 15 that divides this slide? 16 THE WITNESS: That's the line that divides 17 that particular diagram into four. 18 THE COURT: And that's the horizontal line. 19 THE WITNESS: The horizontal line, yes. 20 THE COURT: That's not quite at the halfway 21 mark in the square. 22 THE WITNESS: That's right. Okay? And the 23 same is then done in terms of the left/right 24 discrimination with a number of samples that are 25 spiked with wild -type RNA. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 42 of 204 859 RIMA - DIRECT 1 THE COURT: And you're referring there to 2 the cluster of dot s at the upper part? 3 THE WITNESS: At the top of the diagram. 4 THE COURT: Of the diagram, along the 5 vertical line. 6 THE WITNESS: Yes. And so essentially then 7 the most right -handed point of that set of samples 8 spiked with wild -type RNA defines the second cutoff 9 for wild -type or not. 10 THE COURT: And by \"second cutoff,\" you're 11 referring to that vertical line? 12 THE WITNESS: That's right. So if you spike 13 them with both, then you get your \"Y\" data, 14 essentially your indication of the amount of wild -type 15 RNA that is there, and you get that in the upper right 16 quadrant as a set of samples. 17 THE COURT: And you're circling that more 18 dispersed cluster of dots next to both. 19 THE WITNESS: That's right. And so here's 20 the wild -type spiked samples. The vaccine -spiked 21 samples appear on both. Then we have a cluster of 22 patient data. This cluster of patient data is 23 actually populated very heavily with one single case 24 of an SSPE that was am ongst the litigants in the U.K. 25 THE COURT: And by that, you are referring Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 43 of 204 860A RIMA - DIRECT 1 to the more dispersed cluster of dots along the 2 vertical line, below the wild -type cluster you 3 described before. 4 THE WITNESS: That's right. The controls, 5 the no template controls, or irrelevant templates, are 6 here. 7 THE COURT: And you're circling? 8 THE WITNESS: I am now circling the sample 9 in the bottom left quadrant, several of which are open 10 circles are --. And essentially then where we see 11 most of the claimant samples are in this particular 12 position here. They are in this particular cluster, 13 but some of them are on the right -hand side of that 14 vertical line. Others are on the left -hand side of 15 that vertical line. 16 THE COURT: And you are there circling the 17 cluster of dots in the upper left -hand corner of the 18 box labeled \"vaccine\". 19 THE WITNESS: That's right. Thank you for 20 helping. 21 THE COURT: Lots of experience in describing 22 things. 23 THE WITNESS: Tha nk you for making this as 24 correct a transcript as possible. 25 And essentially what we then have is a Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 44 of 204 861A RIMA - DIRECT 1 situation where you see that most of the claimants 2 sampled, apart from one case which clearly has a wild - 3 type virus in there, sit in this particular position. 4 And essentially when I started to look at the actual 5 raw data, I came to the conclusion that several of 6 these samples had been miscalled, and that is 7 identified in great detail in my report on pages 32 8 and 33, and page 32 has been filed, now, has it? 9 MS. BABCOCK: Yes. 10 THE COURT: Yes. We have it filed as a 11 separate exhibit. 12 THE WITNESS: Okay. So essentially there 13 were a large number of instances where when I started 14 to look at the data, they had certainly been 15 miscalled, because particularly now the \"X\" or \"Y\" 16 data was mistaken as to where the line should be, and 17 then some of them were actually on the wrong side of 18 the line but were nevertheless called vaccines. 19 And in many cases, as you can imagine with a 20 distribution like this, a lot of the replicates would 21 have been on that side and the other replicas would 22 have been from that side of the line. And so it ended 23 up in a situation where we then called these vacc ines 24 but essentially they were undeterminable. 25 // Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 45 of 204 862A RIMA - DIRECT 1 BY MS. BABCOCK: 2 Q So let me be clear with that. If they did a 3 replicate and one showed up on the vaccine side and 4 one showed up on the undetermined side, they could say 5 they have isolated the vaccine strain? 6 A In the reports, they would have said 7 consistent with vaccine and I'll come back to that 8 later, because they could not by the fact that they 9 had not analyzed the F -gene sequences, the H -gene 10 sequences that they used for this, they had not been 11 able thereby to come forward with a proper allelic 12 discrimination test between all wild -types and all 13 vaccine. And so they had to change their claim to not 14 vaccine but consistent with vaccine. 15 But indeed there are a number of cases where 16 the replicates were on either side of this line. To 17 my mind, this is a single di stribution. There's a bit 18 of spread in it, and maybe we can come back to 19 describe and we will come back if we are going into 20 further detail about the fact as to how that can come 21 about. But this is a single distribution. And 22 essentially in some cases, they simply fell on one 23 side of the line and in some cases on the other, and 24 in some cases, even patient sampl es would have had to 25 be called wild -type when they would be sitting Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 46 of 204 863 RIMA - DIRECT 1 basically here or here, for example. 2 THE COURT: And when you are saying this is 3 a single dist ribution, you are circling the cluster of 4 dots in both the undetermined and the vaccine boxes 5 that coincide. 6 THE WITNESS: Contain samples from 7 claimants. 8 THE COURT: And these are the samples that 9 appear on either side of the vertical line. 10 THE WITNESS: So I didn't consent that they 11 had succeeded in making a te st that really was working 12 properly. Essentially, I think that particular test 13 has never really been published as it had not really 14 been verified, and other laboratories have not begun 15 to follow it, because obviously the question as to 16 where does this signal come from is an interesting 17 one, and we can come back to that if we look at in 18 greater detail the t echnical RT PCR. So it is not as 19 if there is no signal. We see if they are negative, 20 there is signal. It's just a matter of how much 21 signal is there as to whether they were considered 22 positive or negative. 23 THE COURT: And by \"signal,\" you're 24 referring to those same dots we just described. 25 THE COURT: I'm referring to that same Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 47 of 204 864 RIMA - DIRECT 1 cluster of dots, right. 2 BY MS. BABCOCK: 3 Q Stepping away from allelic discrimination 4 for a moment, in the Hepner and Kennedy rebuttal 5 opinions, they both seem to suggest a number o f 6 problems can arise in PCR tests where you have low 7 detectable levels of whatever you're targeting. Would 8 you agree? 9 A Uh -uh. 10 THE C OURT: And that was a yes? 11 THE WITNESS: Sorry. Sorry. No, I don't 12 agree with that particular interpretation, because it 13 goes back to the point I made earlier about what 14 material is available to us. Both Dr. Kennedy and Dr. 15 Hepner in my mind made an assumption, namely, that the 16 actual headline figure that was reported, in the case 17 of Cedill o 1.67 times 10 to the fifth copies per 18 nanogram, in the case of Colten Snyder 3.4 times 10 to 19 the fourth copies per nanogram, is indeed something 20 that must indicate that the copy numbers in th e tests 21 were high. That is not necessarily the case. 22 BY MS. BABCOCK: 23 Q And that leads right into my next question. 24 Did you observe discrepancies in the way Unigenetics 25 was reporting their copy numbers? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 48 of 204 865A RIMA - DIRECT 1 A Yes, we have had several discrepancies in 2 that particular area. The first one is the following, 3 and that is the most disturbing in my mind. On 4 several tests, I have seen the data for the copy 5 number in one lab, because it might have been 2,400 6 and a copy done where in the second lab i t might have 7 been zero. What then was reported to us was the value 8 of 2,400. 9 Now a bad scientist would say it's 2,400. 10 Slightly worse scientists would make the average of 11 2,400 and zero as 1,200. But a good scientist would 12 have said there must be something wrong with my test 13 if one is 2,400 and the other one is zero. But this 14 particular method of reporting was widespread IF 15 tables in which data that have occurring 30 out of 40 16 samples, and so zero values were ignored. 17 Q Now accepting for a moment that the high 18 copy number is what it is, it was actually a high copy 19 number, can laboratory problems still exist when you 20 have high copy numbers? 21 A Well, o bviously I think contamination 22 problems have been identified by Steve Bustin and 23 which I have seen and also have been documented quite 24 well in the report by Professor Simmonds. We came to 25 the same conclusion, that there were a series of Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 49 of 204 866A RIMA - DIRECT 1 problems with the actual contamination that was in the 2 laboratory. That is something that I think is most 3 aptly demonstrated in one of the slides that I brought 4 by and produced for you, and that is, for example, 5 this. 6 Q Slide 2? 7 A This is a slide from actuall y it appears Dr. 8 Simmonds' report, page 72, which indicates the sort of 9 replicance between the two samples that would have 10 been put into a GAPDH of the age determination of a 11 particular sample and of the measles \"F\" gene. And 12 this is a scatter diagram you get in which the values 13 found for replicate number one are on the \"X\" axis and 14 replicate nu mber two on the \"Y\" axis. 15 THE COURT: And you're referring to the 16 slide on the left side, the \"F\" gene slide. 17 THE WITNESS: That's right. And these are 18 samples that would be negative in both cases. Here, 19 for example, we have a sample on the top left -hand 20 side of the diagram in which there might have been 21 approximately 5, 6,000 copies of the measles \"F\" gene 22 found, but the replicate would have been negative. 23 THE COURT: So, to make sure I understand 24 the slide, you referred to the dot at the top left - 25 hand corner in saying that that might have been 5 or Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 50 of 204 867 RIMA - DIRECT 1 6,000 copies. 2 THE WITNESS: From the level of replicate 3 number two, it might have been 5 or 6,000. I'm just 4 trying to interpret it on the lower -end axis here. 5 And I'm not sure who did that. 6 THE COURT: And earlier you circled the dot 7 in the bottom left -hand corner. 8 THE WITNESS: That would be a sample that 9 would be declared negative in replicate one and 10 replicate two, okay? But this sample here, for 11 example, would be a sample that would be 5,000 copies 12 in the one replicate, number two, and negative in the 13 other half. 14 THE COURT: And that's why it falls in the 15 negative column. 16 THE WI TNESS: That's right. 17 THE COURT: Because the two runs did not 18 agree. 19 THE WITNESS: That's right. Okay? And so 20 this would have been a reasonable deter mination with a 21 reasonable conformance between the two replicates. So 22 if I look at the top right -most dot there, that would 23 have been one in which replicate number one might have 24 been again 5, 6,000 copies, replicate number two, 5, 25 6,000 copies. Replicate number one might have been in Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 51 of 204 868A RIMA - DIRECT 1 that same class. So that would have been a reasonable 2 concordance between the two figures. 3 But all the other dots are providing the 4 difficulty to us, because they should be, as we see 5 here on the GAPDH line where the best theory works, 6 they should be on the straight line . They should form 7 a cluster around that particular straight line here. 8 THE COURT: And so what you're suggesting as 9 I understand it -- 10 THE WITNESS: What I'm suggesting is that 11 while this test clearly doesn't work, your replicates 12 are very discordant, not concordant, this test worked 13 well. 14 THE COURT: So if the F -gene test worked, 15 you would expect to see the dots forming a diagonal 16 line from the bottom left to the upper right. 17 THE WITNESS: That' s right. That's right. 18 THE COURT: Instead, they're -- 19 THE WITNESS: They're all over the place. 20 THE COURT: Right. 21 BY MS. BABCOCK: 22 Q Now it's been suggested that high copies of 23 measles virus, a high copy number necessarily implies 24 that the threshold cycle was low. 25 // Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 52 of 204 869A RIMA - DIRECT 1 A Yes. 2 Q The CT was low. First, do you agree? 3 A No, I don't. 4 Q What's a housekeeping gene? 5 A A housekeeping gene is a gene that was used 6 simply because it is present in all cells at 7 relatively constant levels. And so housekeeping genes 8 like GAPDH have a relatively constantly level of 9 messenger RNA in each cell, and that is about 1,000 10 copies, okay? 11 So although there is dispute and you'll see 12 some comments in Steven Bustin's report to indicate 13 that GAPDH is not the ideal choice, and we all 14 disagree with each other about what is the ideal 15 choice because you can't always find a situation that 16 you'll have the cell ty pe in which one of these 17 housekeeping genes is upregulated to such a level that 18 you say this is not proper, but a lot of people use 19 GAPDH as a housekeeping gene. So I have no issue with 20 the choice of that particular gene. 21 But the question that you raise is really an 22 important one, because it affects a lot of the data 23 that we have seen, particularly in the Cedillo and in 24 the Colten Snyder case. The headline figures are very 25 high. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 53 of 204 870 RIMA - DIRECT 1 Q Well, the general question is, if there's 2 calculation errors involving GAPDH, th at affects the 3 copy numbers, correct? 4 A It does, because it's normalized to that. 5 THE COURT: And just let me inject here. 6 The second chart to the right is labeled on your chart 7 \"GADPH,\" but that's just a transposition? 8 THE WITNESS: That is the housekeeping gene 9 that is used in the test that Unigenetics worked. 10 THE COURT: I guess what I'm asking, are we 11 talking about the same thing? The title of the slide 12 refers to \"GAPDH.\" 13 THE WITNESS: Yes. 14 THE COU RT: The slide itself showing the 15 dots refers to \"GADPH.\" Is that a typo? 16 THE WITNESS: That must be a typo in 17 Professor Simmons' report. 18 THE COURT: O kay. But we're talking about 19 the same thing. 20 THE WITNESS: It is the same gene, sorry. 21 I'm sorry about that. 22 BY MS. BABCOCK: 23 Q And then I think you were moving on to Slide 24 3 with the calculations. 25 A Yes. So essentially the important factor to Heritage Reporting Corporat ion (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 54 of 204 871A RIMA - DIRECT 1 recognize, and this is where I think I disagree with 2 the rebut tals of Dr. Kennedy and Dr. Hepner, is that 3 the headline figures as they are reported to us in 4 this case can be derived from a large number of 5 different situations. 6 And for that, I have to indulge you in a 7 couple of slides to take the type of suit up. Having 8 read some of the transcripts, I can see that there is 9 a potential fo r confusion about core CTs, high CTs, 10 low CTs, low copy numbers and high copy numbers. 11 Therefore, I will discuss only copy numbers, but 12 remember that it is always based on the CT values. 13 So, in most of the reports that we see, we 14 see, for example, in the case of Cedillo that there's 15 a reported figure of 1.67 times 10 to the 5 per 16 nanogram of RNA. Now this figure is derived by first 17 of all establishing the number of measles F copies in 18 a given sample volume. That given sample volume is 19 only in the reference data 5 microliters, and they 20 extracted RNA in 50 microliters so they have enough 21 for 10 tests. 22 And the second thing that needs to be done 23 is to decide and then look at the GAPDH housekeeping 24 gene, messenger RNA. In the same sample volume. So 25 that is how that figure is derived. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 55 of 204 872A RIMA - DIRECT 1 Q Moving to Slide 4. 2 A Moving now to the next slide, so in most 3 samples that I have seen for a report of the copy 4 numbers of measles F in the sample, the actual copy 5 number in that term is from the low end of the 6 standard curve. So we are looking at the right -hand 7 side with Figure 18 in my report. But most of the 8 actual determinations of copy numbers were done in 9 this range on the left-hand range of the standard 10 chart. 11 Q The right -hand chart. Okay. It's the line 12 which, again, we're going to file this again in color. 13 A It is the blue line, correct. So this 14 particular diagram is derived from material that the 15 manufacturers of the ABI TaqMan system provide to 16 people who want to use the system, and they compare 17 their absolutely straight standard curve with that of 18 the competitor, which has curves on the outside, which 19 means that if you are working in this low copy number 20 area, you really don't get the proper evaluation of 21 the numbers of copies based on the cycle numbers. And 22 so you see this before at any cycle number over 35, or 23 40. 24 In the -- cycle, background PCR is generally 25 distrusted by experts, which allows me to make the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 56 of 204 873A RIMA - DIRECT 1 point that most of the values that I've seen are 2 actually outside the standard curve that Unigenetics 3 had in the sample itself. So in most cases, their 4 standard curves were stopping at 500 copies per 5 sample, and so they make the standard curve from 5, I 6 can't remember what it was. I think it was 500,000, 7 and they did indeed take it to the root of ten for 8 each time, and they stopped at 500. 9 But then they reported copy numbers on the 10 order of well below 500, so then you would be working 11 on this part of the graph where you're working to the 12 left of your last standard in, so you're extrapolating 13 your data from the standard c urve, assuming that this 14 is a linear relationship. 15 THE COURT: I'm not sure I followed that. 16 THE WITNESS: Okay. 17 THE COURT: Can you try again? 18 THE WITNESS: Yes. So the standard curve as 19 determined is set up by making let's say for the sake 20 of argument 50 copies, 500, 5,000, 50,000, 500,000, 21 5,000,000, okay? 22 THE COURT: Now I think I understand what 23 you were saying. 24 THE WITNESS: Yes? But most of the copy 25 numbe rs that are actually reported in the data are to Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 57 of 204 874 RIMA - DIRECT 1 the left of that low standard point, so that is an 2 extrapolation. You just assume that the curve 3 continues in this way and thereby you end up in a 4 situation where you assume to make that assumption, 5 and then you assign a copy number to that particular 6 value, yes. 7 THE COURT: Okay. 8 TH E WITNESS: So that is in itself, and I 9 make reference to that in my report, a deplorable way 10 of doing a test. Most of us like to do a test where 11 the values that we determine somewhere along t he line 12 are in the middle of the range of the curve rather 13 than somewhere to the left or to the right of the 14 standard curve. So essentially then we have to look 15 at what is -- 16 MS. BABCOCK: Slide 5. 17 THE WITNESS: Sorry. Are we going back? 18 No? 19 BY MS. BABCOCK: 20 Q No. We're on Slide 5. 21 A So the number of GAPDH messenger RNA copies 22 that was determined in the sample is often also low. 23 Particularly when that sample of RNA is degraded, we 24 end up in a situation where the GAPDH is low in 25 particular, and a reference has been made by Steven Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 58 of 204 875A RIMA - DIRECT 1 Bustin to the fact that he can clearly demonstrate 2 where particular RNAs are degraded because the GAPDH 3 copy number becomes low. 4 Now the manufacturer of the Taqman kits and 5 many independent studies give us a figure of the 6 following kind in that the average cell conta ins about 7 10 picograms of RNA, messenger RNA, which in general 8 parlance means every cell has about 200,000 messenger 9 RNA molecules in it. And it's important to remember 10 th at figure because we come back to it later. 11 So of those 200,000 messenger RNA in a cell, 12 about 1,000 of them are GAPDH. That being said, if 13 you have 100,000 copies of GAPDH, you'll s ay that is 14 equivalent to a nanogram of RNA simply based on the 15 idea that 100 times 1,000 is 100,000, 100 times 10 16 picograms gives you a nanogram, okay? And so 1 17 nanogram is the approximate amount of RNA in 100 18 cells. If we go on then -- 19 Q Slide 6. 20 A -- we get to the following. The reported 21 headline figure could be based o n very different raw 22 data. 23 Q And this is just to be clear 1.67 going back 24 a couple slides. 25 A This goes back to the headline figure that Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 59 of 204 876A RIMA - DIRECT 1 is on the first slide, which in the Cedillo case was 2 1.67 times 10 to the 5. So you could report that 3 figure of 1.67 times 10 to the 5, which is 167,000, if 4 you had 100,000 copies of GAPDH in your samples. But 5 you would report that also if you had 1.6 million 6 copies of the F in your sample, but a million copies 7 of your GAPDH, yes? 8 THE COURT: Okay. 9 THE WITNESS: So just to digress back to the 10 CTs, that would be correct if that was your test 11 because you really would have large numbers of copies. 12 But what is more frequently the case in my experience 13 is the following, that the F copies were low and the 14 GAPDH copies are low, and still the headline figure 15 because of normalization would have been produced at 16 1.6 times 105 per nanogram. They simply multiplied 17 this figure up by what you need to get from this 18 figure in order to get to 100,000. 19 And even if it was 167 MDF copies properties 20 and a 100 GAPDH, that same figure would have been 21 reported to us as 1.67 times 105 per nanogram. And 22 this is where I had serious problems with what was 23 b eing reported in these two cases because all we have 24 seen is the headline figures. We have not seen any of 25 the underlying data that I have seen in the U.K. Heritage Reporting Corpor ation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 60 of 204 877A RIMA - DIRECT 1 litigation as a standard amount of evidence that would 2 have been provided to us. 3 BY MS. BABCOCK: 4 Q Let me just clarify that, though. Even when 5 you saw the extra data in the U.K. litigation, were 6 you satisfied that Unigenetics was calculating things 7 properly and identifying? 8 A Well, on occasion, they made calculation 9 mistakes, and they had a structural mistake in their 10 standard operating procedure because a lot of it was 11 marker -related to base variant of 660 and not 375. 12 It's very technical to go into here. It's not that 13 relevant. All of their figures are off by a factor of 14 two, but we are usually dealing with orders of 15 magnitude in this, although they have immense belief 16 and confidence in their technology so that they said, 17 well, we have 6.63 copies in this particular case. 18 Now, if we then look at that, so in my 19 experience, the headline figures that were reported 20 were largely coming from data like this. Therefore, 21 it is wrong to say for Professor Kennedy and Professor 22 Hepner that essentially the CTs must have been low 23 because the headline figure is so high. The data are 24 simply not there. There is no evidence in this 25 particular case. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 61 of 204 878A RIMA - DIRECT 1 THE COURT: We don't know what the CT 2 figures were? 3 THE WITNESS: Exactly, we don't know. 4 MS. BABCOCK: Page Seven. 5 THE WITNESS: So in my experience from all 6 the data that I have seen from Unige netics is that the 7 high reported headline figures come from the bottom of 8 the type of unreliable determinations of copy numbers 9 of the MDF and GAPDH. And many of those I even 10 pointed to outside the range of the standard. 11 I refer you to Table 3, 10 to 17 in Section 12 B of my report, where you'll see many examples of 13 lower values that are reported as high headline 14 figures simply because we had the information in the 15 U.K. litigation available to us, and I started to get 16 information that h as been passed to us by the 17 understanding in both the Cedillo and the Colten 18 Snyder case, but it's not available to us. 19 BY MS. BABCOCK: 20 Q Now can contamin ation still be a problem 21 with a high copy number? 22 A Of course, because it is a sort of somewhat 23 random event, and so if you have contamination and 24 you're contaminat ing samples, then they will be able 25 to have high copy numbers. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 62 of 204 879A RIMA - DIRECT 1 Q And does an entire run need to be positive 2 for contamination to be at play? 3 A No. 4 Q Why is that? 5 A Because it all depends on where you find 6 some of the samples. Again, in the U.K. litigation, 7 we were provided with data for each of the litigants 8 that showed where their samples were on a particular 9 plate, and in many cases, we found that contamination 10 was closest to the row in which the high copy numbers 11 were available for the standard curve. So there was 12 an effect of how the closer your sample was to the 13 extended curve line the more likely it was that you 14 might end up with a me asured copy number. That was 15 the threshold sort of effect that can occur during a 16 test. 17 Q Is it a positive control? 18 A The positive controls that are return ed in 19 the standard curve for that particular application. 20 Q Just wanted to make sure that was clear. So 21 hypothetically if you had CSF samples next to the 22 positive control, and a whole blood sample elsewhere 23 on the plate, would it be feasible for the CSF to be 24 positive and whole blood negative? 25 A Certainly so. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 63 of 204 880A RIMA - DIRECT 1 Q And that would still be because of 2 contamination? 3 A Exactly. 4 Q Now did you also observe variations in runs 5 depending on the day they were done? 6 A We did, and that is very well documented in 7 my report and even better in Professor Simmons' report 8 where essentially we saw whole runs in which 9 everything was negative and we saw runs in which 10 everything was quite high, and I identified that in my 11 report as areas in which on some days out of 48 12 samples, there might be some 36 or 37 that are 13 positive and the next d ay nothing is positive. 14 Well, you either have biased your samples on 15 the plates somehow, or alternatively you have massive 16 contamination on one day and not on the next. So that 17 contamination problem doesn't disappear as a result of 18 that. 19 Q Now I wanted to ask you about the testing 20 that was done on Colten Snyder in this case on CSF and 21 whole blood. One was positive, one was negative, 22 correct? The CSF and the whole blood test? 23 A That's right. The headline figure reported 24 3.4 times 104 for the CSF , blood was negative. 25 Q I think it's 3.7 times 104. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 64 of 204 881A RIMA - DIRECT 1 A It is 3.7. Sorry. 2 Q Just nitpicky. The samples were drawn on 3 the same day, correct? 4 A Uh -huh. 5 THE COURT: And that was a yes? 6 THE WITNESS: Yes. Sorry. 7 BY MS. BABCOCK: 8 Q Now, accepting for a moment the results, did 9 this make sense for CSF to be strongly positive while 10 whole blood is entirely negative? 11 A Not to me in the sense that the figure that 12 is described in the CSF of course is one that is again 13 given as a headline figure of a per nanogram basis. 14 We must assume that there must have been some GAPDH 15 copies and th at we have a look at extractions out of 16 the RNA. And neither in the measles pathogenesis or 17 the normal infection or in SSPE or in any of the 18 infections do we actually see a large amount of fre e 19 virus in any of the tissues or in samples like serum 20 or CSF or PBMC's, so it must have come from cells. 21 And the cell types that we find in the CSF 22 would be the same as those that you would find in the 23 PBMC fraction. So assuming that you had a long -term 24 infection which had gone on for years, I find it very 25 strange that you would have the cells in your CSF as Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 65 of 204 882A RIMA - DIRECT 1 positive to an enormous extent, and again, we can come 2 back to that later, and the PBMC with a zero copy 3 number. 4 Q Now again accepting that its valid, how much 5 measles virus would that finding translate to in 6 Colten? Is that a high number? 7 A In his CSF? 8 Q Uh -huh. 9 A It is a very high number. 10 Q Higher than maximum viremia in wild measles 11 virus infection? 12 A No, it's very difficult to say that. I 13 mean, the only figure we have is the following, th at 14 first of all, there was no measles virus found, okay? 15 All that has been found in his CSF is a copy number of 16 a DNA molecule that is supposedly coming from an RNA 17 molecu le, which is supposedly coming from a measles 18 virus infection, so there are a number of suppositions 19 in that. 20 To say that is a high number is based on a 21 very simp le sort of calculation. I've already given 22 the Court the sort of guesstimate that we work with in 23 molecular biology that a cell is not doing 1,000 24 copies of messenger RNA, but in an acute infection, if 25 I set up one of my best growing viruses, measles Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 66 of 204 883A RIMA - DIRECT 1 viruses, in one of my easiest to grow cells like the 2 vero cell, I can get about 3,000 copies of measles F 3 gene per messenger RNA per cell. That's the best I 4 can get, okay? 5 So if you get to figures like 3 times 106 6 per nanogram, that means that you have three times 104 7 copies of that particular RNA per cell, and that is 8 three times 104 would be 30,000, okay? So any figure 9 at that level I immediately suspect as completely and 10 utterly wrong in the sense that that is very 11 implausible biologically because it would indicate 12 that that cell would be stuffed with measles F. 13 And as Dr. Kennedy rightly pointed out, that 14 would have also in order for that to be biologically 15 correct would have also meant that there will probably 16 be 10 times more copies of the measles F, about 80 17 percent of tha t figure, measles N, another 80 percent 18 of that with measles M, et cetera, because we have 19 this gradient gene expression that he well described, 20 which I have absolutely no problem with. 21 So if you get to figures of that order of 22 magnitude, you know that it would have indicated that 23 every cell would be stuffed with measles virus, okay? 24 If that's the case, we don't need to go to any of the 25 // Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 67 of 204 884A RIMA - DIRECT 1 sort of TaqMan technology or any of the technologies 2 that have been used by Unigenetics in order to 3 demonstrate the presence of the virus in these 4 children because it would have been a double. You 5 would have had positive solution phase. You could 6 have done the immunocytochemistry. You might have 7 even been able to isolate the virus, or it would have 8 been fairly simple. Anyone competent in this 9 particular field would have been able to pick up the 10 virus because it wou ld have been in every cell in very 11 large quantities. So that is where we are in the 12 situation that essentially the headline copy numbers 13 that I described to us are biologically implausible. 14 Q Did you also review Dr. Bradstreet's 2004 15 paper? 16 A I did. 17 Q Looking at his paper and comparing it to 18 your UK report that was fi led, did you determine that 19 several of those children are included? 20 A That's right, and I have prepared a slide 21 for that. 22 Q Slide 8. 23 A So, on the top of that slide, we see that 24 the -- 25 THE COURT: All right. Our copy of Slide 8 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 68 of 204 885 RIMA - DIRECT 1 looks very different from this. 2 THE WITNESS: Yes, that' s right. Special 3 Master, there is a problem, and that is that I in my 4 somewhat inexperienced method of operation produced an 5 animated slide, so what you see there is a printout of 6 the final animation, and we'll come to that animation. 7 THE COURT: Okay. 8 THE WITNESS: The top of this particular 9 slide as we see it there is the Table N o. 2 from the 10 Bradstreet paper. 11 THE COURT: Okay. If you'll give me just a 12 moment then so I can find the Bradstreet paper? 13 (Pause.) 14 THE COURT: Mr. Wickersham, can you identify 15 the exhibit number for the Bradstreet paper? 16 MR. WICKERSHAM: It's Petitioners' Exhibit 17 188. 18 TH E COURT: 188? Thank you very much. 19 All right. Thank you. I'm prepared. 20 THE WITNESS: So in Table 2 of that, this is 21 part of Table 2 only, I haven't shown the controls 22 because the bottom line from the controls is just 23 simply a straight set of negatives. The essential one 24 is autistic spectrum disorder. Do you want me to 25 explain? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 69 of 204 886A RIMA - DIRECT 1 MS. BABCOCK: Let me st op for you a moment. 2 I'll just note that Table 2 is on page 42. 3 THE WITNESS: Okay. First of all, I was 4 able in Table 3 of my report to identify the other two 5 children, and Table 3 in my report deals with the CSF 6 cases in the American cases, and obviously I have only 7 seen these anonymized data. Unfortunately for us, I 8 have not be en able to find the data that might have 9 been anonymized but might have referred to Colten 10 Snyder. 11 BY MS. BABCOCK: 12 Q So these refer to the other two children? 13 A The other two children are -- 14 Q In the Bradstreet paper? 15 A -- No. 265 and No. 498 in my table, which I 16 show an excerpt on this particular slide. And these 17 children there, Child No. 1 is 490 of which a CSF 18 determination was done, and what you see at the bottom 19 table is that the CSF and the GAPDH was 2.9 times 101 20 and 5.5 times 101, 29 and 55 respectively, and so 21 presumably a figure of 37 or thereabouts would have 22 been used as the figure . 23 For the measles F, they would have come 24 forward with a determination of 1.1 times 104 and 9.5 25 times 103. Very high numbers, but as I indicated, my Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 70 of 204 887A RIMA - DIRECT 1 interpretations are based on contamination. Then 2 multiplying the average of 1.1 times 104 and 9.5 times 3 103, let's say 10,005, whatever you have to multiply 4 to get from 100,000 to 37, 7,000, you end up in a 5 figure of 2.42 times 107 copies per nanogram. 6 So Child No. 1 in the CSF had 2.42 times 107 7 copies per nanogram. That's the sort of figure that 8 you would have seen if yo u had no other data, that's 9 the headline figure that we're dealing with in this 10 particular case, and that gives rise to that 11 particular headline figure. That headline figure 12 means that every messenger RNA in those cells is 13 measles F, and they're still stuffed with that. It's 14 still a higher number than 200,000 per cell. 15 So essentially we're in a situat ion where 16 this is completely and utterly implausible as a 17 phenome. What's interesting is that the other child 18 is 265, had a GAPDH of 9.8 times 101 and 7.4 times 101 19 if I see that correct. I haven't got a slide on my 20 screen. 21 Q Yes, that is correct. 22 A Okay. And given a figure of 6.2 times 103, 23 5.2 times 103, and the figure is 6.60 times 106, which 24 is the figure that you see in the Bradstreet paper, 25 hence this is the type of data that convinces me that Heritage Reportin g Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 71 of 204 888A RIMA - DIRECT 1 I'm looking at the right child. We hadn't seen that 2 figure anywhere else. I looked at this fresh frozen 3 biopsy. 4 Now fresh frozen biopsy, you expect good 5 messenger RNA extractions, and indeed you see the 6 headline figure is going out to 8.2 times 104, 6.4 7 times 104. The technical figure for the measles F is 8 zero, and maybe you can see that in the copy you have, 9 or 770. And then you s ee the figure that is then 10 determined, you ignore the zero as per standard 11 treatment of Unigenetics, and you end up with a figure 12 of 1 times 103, and that's the figure that you see in 13 the table here. 14 Q Okay. So in that middle box, where the 15 black mark is is supposed to be a zero? 16 A That is a zero, yes. It's red in my 17 original report. I don't know whether a copy, a color 18 copy of my redacted report is available or why that 19 was redacted in such a fast way that it didn't -- 20 Q Do you have color copies? 21 A Yes, I have color copies. 22 Q Okay. 23 A And then the whole blood, a different story 24 again. We see in this particular case whole b lood. 25 The reasonable GAPDH had a low number of this certain Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 72 of 204 889 RIMA - DIRECT 1 set and very high copy number for measles F, four 2 times 103, 2.1 times 103. 3 Q That's 102. 4 A Sorry? Is that 102? 5 Q Two. 6 A I'm sorry. I can't see them on my screen 7 here. 8 Q It's okay. 9 A And essentially that is now in this case 10 done because this is such a high number. This becomes 11 2.1 copies per nanogram. 12 THE COURT: And all of this information is 13 from No. 265 on your slide? 14 THE WITNESS: That's right. That's right. 15 THE COURT: So whatever claimant number. 16 THE WITNESS: And what we see in this 17 particular case, 265 is measles F. It gets in the 18 ileal biopsy coming from this information and copy 19 number being this, in the blood PS copy number being 20 2.1 per nanogram a nd then in the CSF, 6.6 times 106. 21 BY MS. BABCOCK: 22 Q You're referring to Row 2 in the top chart? 23 A I'm referring to Child No. 2 in that table. 24 THE COURT: And this is Child No. 2 from the 25 Bradstreet paper. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 73 of 204 890A RIMA - DIRECT 1 THE WITNESS: I haven't been able to find in 2 my records where this figure comes from yet, but less 3 than one copy per nanogram. Then one copy per 4 nanogram, let's assume that you have a good infection 5 in one cell that gives you 3,000 copies of measles F 6 per nanogram if you have one in 100 cells infected. 7 So you can see that one copy per nanogram actually 8 means that one in 100 times 3,000 cells, so 100 times 9 3,000 is 3,000,000 cells is infected. 10 We've had a lot of debate about that 11 particular type of argument because what it means is 12 to say, well, there are very few systems in the body 13 which will destroy pathogenic effect in which if one 14 out of 300,000 cells wasn't doing what it was supposed 15 to be doing, it is a simple chance of if that was the 16 case, our body wouldn't really work all that well, so 17 in those c ases, we have substantial redundancy in all 18 of the functions. And so that is where that figure in 19 itself is not going to give you any explanation for 20 pathology or for clinical effect. 21 So let's then look at Colten Snyder's case. 22 He was identified as the third child in this 23 particular paper, and the headline figure for him is 24 3.7 times 104 in CSF . The blood as we've already 25 established was negative, although I have already Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 74 of 204 891A RIMA - DIRECT 1 indicated why I found that surprising. And then in 2 his ileal biopsy, we have a new type of report in this 3 litigation that says greater than seven. 4 Now, scientifically, it's very hard to know 5 what greater than seven means. I can understand what 6 less than seven means in a particular ins tance. It 7 means that it's below viral detection level. But 8 greater than seven was a new form of reporting that 9 Unigenetics came up with, and we asked on several 10 occasions what does this mean. And we never received 11 a proper answer to that particular question. It is 12 still a mystery to me how you could get to greater 13 than seven. 14 Now there is one potential explanation. 15 That's the following: If you say I have less than one 16 copy or less than 10 copies of GAPDH, so in my 17 denominator, it is l ess than 10. Then if you divide 18 your numerator by a denominator which is less than, 19 then you get to a figure that is greater than. But if 20 that's the case, you should say there is no RNA in 21 this sample and I shouldn't report it at all. 22 And one of the most I must say difficult to 23 understand examples I've had is where I have seen the 24 report from Unigenet ics where it blithely was reported 25 zero copies of GAPDH, zero copies of measles F, where Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 75 of 204 892A RIMA - DIRECT 1 the headline figure is zero copies of measles F per 2 nanogram of RNA, which essentially makes no sense. 3 The proper way of reporting that is say I have no RNA 4 to write out all these layers because there was 5 nothing in the samples. 6 THE COURT: So rather than per RNA, i t 7 should have been no RNA. 8 THE WITNESS: There was nothing. 9 THE COURT: There was no RNA? 10 THE WITNESS: There was no RNA, right. And 11 so I think this is where I want to emphasize this 12 particular point, because I think it is important to 13 recognize the paucity of the data that we have here. 14 We have only a headline figure for both Cedillo and 15 for Colten Snyder, and essentially that could have 16 been derived from zero, and five sum copies could be 17 divided from zero and 50 co pies divided by 10 copies 18 of GAPDH, that's just a very small copy number of 19 GAPDH. 20 So, with the absence of that data, it is 21 very difficult for us to know exactly what this 22 particular claim that there is measles virus in his 23 CSF and therefore in his brain is actually based. 24 It's based on a single sheet of paper that comes from 25 a lab oratory, which I've already indicated there are a Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 76 of 204 892B RIMA - DIRECT 1 number of questions first of all about the calculation Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 77 of 204 893 RIMA - DIRECT 1 methodology, secondly, about the fact that essentially 2 we are in a position where not knowing what the GAPDH 3 was and what normalization factors that have been 4 applied actually allows us to interpret this headline 5 data in any way, shape or form. That is where I think 6 both cases in my opinion are based on evidence which 7 is much less strong than I would have expected to see. 8 That is a disappointment in this particular situation 9 to me. 10 Now there's a third aspect of this that is 11 relating to the Bradstreet paper, and that is that Dr. 12 Bradstreet refers in the paper to the fact that there 13 has been a demonstration of the nucleocapsid protein, 14 not the RNA but the protein of measles in these cases, 15 and in the paper, he refers to the paper, reference 16 No. 25 by Andy Wakefield, and if you look a t that 17 particular reference, there are no data in it. There 18 are only assertions that things have been found. 19 And what is surprising and astonishing to me 20 that if such data would have been available that the 21 claimants would not have presented them to me in the 22 sense that I would have expected that if you based 23 your claim that there is measles virus in t he CSF and 24 you state that these children have been shown to have 25 nucleocapsid protein of measles virus in the tissues Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 78 of 204 894A RIMA - DIRECT 1 that you then don't actually supply the data that 2 would support th at particular aspect of your claim. 3 So that is surprising to me, but it does 4 highlight to me the rather weak basis on which these 5 cases have been put in front of you, a basis which I 6 think is much weaker than the ones that I have 7 certainly seen in a number of the U.K. claimants' 8 cases where all that data was available. And it is 9 astonishing to me that that data hasn't been provided 10 to us so we can make the proper interpretation of the 11 data. 12 BY MS. BABCOCK: 13 Q No w, during his testimony on Tuesday, Dr. 14 Kennedy discussed a gentleman named Professor Cotter? 15 A Yes. 16 Q Professor Cotter is also discussed in 17 Stephen Bustin' s report and I believe Professor 18 Simmonds' report, and I know Steve Bustin discussed 19 him during his testimony. 20 A Yes. 21 Q Who is Professor Cotter? 22 A Professor Cotter is a professor at one of 23 the London colleges. I think it is The Barts and 24 London Hospital, and he runs a diagnostic laboratory 25 and uses Taqman RT PCRs. He was approached by the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 79 of 204 895A RIMA - DIRECT 1 claimants in the U.K. litigation to actually provide a 2 backup and confirmation of the Taqman RT PCR data from 3 the Unigenetics Lab. 4 Q And based upon your understanding of thi s 5 specifically through Dr. Bustin's testimony and 6 Professor Simmonds' report, what were Professor 7 Cotter's experiences in attempting to replicate the 8 Unigenetics work? 9 A Well, there were original problems, which 10 have been identified and which were referred to by Dr. 11 Kennedy, but at the end of the day, Professor Cotter 12 was not able to confirm the data that were provided by 13 Unigenetics. And both a number of Professor Simmonds' 14 data -- let me go back. We had a long discussion in 15 the U.K. case as to whether or not we shoul d try to 16 reproduce the actual data and do the testing again. 17 And at the end of the day, it came down to 18 this deliberation that essentially none of us could. 19 Havi ng seen the quality of the data that Unigenetics 20 had provided, having seen the sort of questions that 21 we raised about them, we were not in a position to 22 convince ourselves that it would be reas onable to 23 subject the children to the rather invasive 24 technologies of taking ileal biopsies and taking CSFs 25 in order to simply provide ourselves with backup Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 80 of 204 896A RIMA - DIRECT 1 testing material. 2 So the respondents never tested the children 3 for the very simple reason that they could not see 4 ethically that this would be the steps you take, 5 although it might well have been a very quick and easy 6 way out of the Court. And so we then had a later 7 series of data, and this is the so -called E -series, 8 which I refer to in my report, I think Steve Bustin 9 refers to and Professor Simmons refers to as well 10 where that actually was split, the samples were split 11 over the respondents and the claimants. 12 And essentially Pro fessor Simmons not having 13 access to Taqman but having validation of the 14 sensitivity of his techniques which was based on a 15 nested RT PCR approach, and that is essentially why 16 your PCR up was one set of primers, and then you take 17 a set of primers further in and you PCR up again. A 18 very, very tricky technique to perform without getting 19 contamination, but all the d ata in Professor Simmonds' 20 report indicate that he managed to do that. 21 And we went as far as I supplied him with a 22 measles strain, a standard material strain which is 23 extinct, which is no longer around so that we couldn't 24 be confusing any sample of any results from his data 25 that is currently circulating and those strains of Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 81 of 204 897A RIMA - DIRECT 1 measles. 2 Now Professor Simmo ns was not able to 3 replicate the data. He did nested PCR on the N gene 4 and the H gene. The N gene would have been the choice 5 for everyone who wanted to prove that measles is 6 anywhere, because in an acute infection, measles N 7 gene is present in about 30,000 copies per cell 8 whereas F is almost seven or eight fold below, and so 9 we end up in a situa tion where he tried with the best 10 and most likely gene and he fails to find any samples 11 positive, whereas Unigenetics reported some positive. 12 I can only say that Dr. Cotter, when he 13 extracted his RNA in his own lab, he did not find any 14 positive data. And there were two possibly borderline 15 positives, and it turned out that those have been RNAs 16 extracted from Unigenetics. So the conclusion that we 17 drew from that was that the Cotter laboratory and the 18 Simmons laboratory were not able to confirm the 19 Unigenetics data , and they were indeed having some 20 modestly weak data to show that contamination had 21 occurred there. 22 Q At the end of Steve Bustin's testimony, we 23 asked him to identify his top three biggest issues 24 with Unigenetics, and I'll give you that opportunity 25 in a minute, but first I wanted to just go through the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 82 of 204 897B RIMA - DIRECT 1 three things he picked out. He picked out that on at Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 83 of 204 898A RIMA - DIRECT 1 least one occasion, the lab had forgotten to do the RT 2 step and still got a positive result. Clear 3 indication of contamination? 4 A (Nonverbal response.) 5 Q Can you say yes or no? 6 A Pardon? 7 Q You have to say yes or no, not nod for the 8 purposes of the record. 9 A Yes. 10 Q Perfect. He also discussed his observation 11 that there were instances where F gene results from 12 frozen tissue and formalin -fixed tissue had similar CT 13 counts, implying the y were both amplifying at the same 14 time. Does this make sense given the different types 15 of tissue? 16 A No, it doesn't because it's much more 17 difficult to extract RNA from fixed material. 18 Q And you discussed some of this today, but 19 Steven also observed instances where the housekeeping 20 gene GAPDH wasn't amplifying properly, but Unigenetics 21 still used their results from the F gene? 22 A Yes. 23 Q And is it a problem? 24 A It is, yes. 25 Q Are these small issues or more substantial Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 84 of 204 899 RIMA - DIRECT 1 significant ones? 2 A I think they are extremely substantial 3 issues, and they in my mind indicate as I've already 4 testified here today that the tests that were being 5 done could not be relied upon. And I've indicated 6 that in my report. 7 Q Do you think these problems were isolated or 8 widespread? 9 A It's not difficult to find some of the 10 problems that I've identified today. I'm not sure 11 that I would agree with Steve Bustin's ranking in my 12 mind. 13 Q And what are your top three? 14 A My top would be this. I cannot understand 15 how you can do a replicate and have 34 copies, 2,400 16 cop ies in one and zero in another and then dare to 17 declare that this 2,400 copies is the right figure. 18 That is still my top. And if you look at that, and we 19 might have to go back to this particular slide as 20 well, that is still my top because it is so 21 inconsistent with normal scientific procedure. Nobody 22 does that. 23 I can only provide you with a statement 24 which the Unigenetics Laboratory made, and that is 25 that it felt that there were no false positives in Heritage Reporting Cor poration (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 85 of 204 900A RIMA - DIRECT 1 this testing regime. It was not possible to have a 2 false positive. And so one ended up in a situation 3 where if there was a positive, then that is in fact 4 your belief, and I can only describe it as a belief 5 because I cannot think that I have seen any test in my 6 life that has no false positives in it. 7 If you believe that, then maybe you can make 8 what I would consider a very serious error of saying 9 2,400 and zero, and we're ending up producing a figure 10 of 2,400, not 1,200. What obviously would have been 11 the best way to say is let's do it again. The 12 opportunity existed. They extracted the RNA in 50 13 microliters. They used 5 microliters per sample, per 14 test, so two replicates of GAPDH and two replicates of 15 measles that they us ed up 20 microliters. 16 I would have said if I really wanted to know 17 what that is, I expect another 20 microliters of this 18 in order to make sure that I get it right, but that 19 wasn't done. So that is still my number one. 20 The fact that they didn't use the N gene and 21 didn't use an optimized assay is a second one. The 22 enzyme that the used in their kits is called Tth 23 enzyme. This is a combined reverse transcriptase DNA 24 polymerase. Most of the other people use an optimized 25 reverse transcriptase to get over the inefficiency of Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 86 of 204 901A RIMA - DIRECT 1 that first step and then go in with a DNA polymerase, 2 and most of those work quite well. 3 Using this particular enzyme, which is 4 essentially working in the assay an d under sub -optimal 5 conditions for the reverse transcription step as well 6 as sub -optimal conditions for the DNA polymerase step, 7 that in my mind is an error of judgment to use an 8 enzyme like that. 9 It has two consequences. Your sensitivity 10 isn't as great as it should be, and that's why in any 11 sort of comparative analysis, and I have been involved 12 in a number of attempts like Dr. Oldstone to bring the 13 O'Leary Lab into international comparisons of 14 laboratories that could do measles testing in order to 15 see whether their test ing was much more successful or 16 not, and the Kawashima Lab that has been referred to 17 in some of the papers and some of the reports did 18 participate. It turned out to be extremely incapable 19 of detecting measles at, very low sensitivities. 20 And at the end of the day, I cannot know 21 what the sensitivity of the Taqman RT PCR is, but it 22 was done under subop timal conditions for reverse 23 transcriptionerase. So that is something that worries 24 me. And I must say that had I been in their position, 25 I would have worked much harder than they did on Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 87 of 204 902 RIMA - DIRECT 1 trying to find a test that would look at the 2 nucleocapsid genes for these factors that I've already 3 indicated that in normal infections, there's about 4 seven, eight times hig her in terms of the copy numbers 5 per cell than we had. 6 Q Now you've already stated, so I won't ask 7 you this again, but you do not have confidence in 8 Unigenetics' re sults in general? 9 A No, I don't, and I think it is that and it 10 is inconsistency. I'm sorry that we didn't develop 11 the last line completely. Maybe I can go to the 12 printed version that you have, because it illustrates 13 the sort of discussion and the sort of general lack of 14 confidence that I have in the data that had been 15 presented from the laboratory. 16 If you look at the final part of that, 17 there's the following, that yes, 20 microliters was 18 used for the GAPDH and the measles F determination. 19 Samples were set as ide for allelic discrimination 20 assays. And what we see in the case of Dr. 21 Bradstreet's paper for Sample No. 490 and 265 is that 22 when the allelic discrimination tests were run a year 23 later, both samples were negative in the CSF. 24 So this sample, which in one case had 6.1 25 times 106 copies had become negative as it was used in Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 88 of 204 903 RIMA - DIRECT 1 the allelic discrimination test. And that's simply 2 Packer's (ph) belief in a sense either you had lessons 3 on the bench for a year, which is probably not what 4 they're describing as standard operating procedure, or 5 alternative ly the data are completely destroyed. 6 So the data for this Child No. 2, and 1 and 7 2 in Dr. Bradstreet's paper are already essentially -- 8 I have information in my report to indicate th at there 9 was no RNA in those CSFs. The only conclusion 10 therefore I can come to is that the original figure 11 was based on contamination in the original test run. 12 Q S o is it fair to say that your conclusions 13 about Unigenetics in general apply specifically to 14 Colten Snyder and Michelle Cedillo? 15 A They do. 16 Q And based on your decades of experience and 17 research in the field of measles virus and MMR vaccine 18 specifically, do you have any belief that there's a 19 link between MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorder? 20 A I have no belief of that kind at all. I 21 would say that it's not a matter of belief either. 22 It's a matter of well -documented and well -evidenced 23 research that indicates that that link doesn't exist. 24 Q And that opinion extends specifically to 25 Colten Snyder? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 89 of 204 904A RIMA - DIRECT 1 A It does. 2 Q Now you alluded to this earlier, and I think 3 we sort of hinted at it. There's other things that 4 you've read and know about from the U.K. litigation 5 that you canno t discuss here today? 6 A That's right. 7 Q And those items play into your opinion that 8 the MMR vaccine cannot cause ASD? 9 A They do. 10 Q But nevertheless, you can reach your 11 opinions here today without the benefit of that 12 additional information? 13 A I think so. I think I've demonstrated to 14 you why I have doubts about the quality of the data, 15 the quality of the interpretations. I've also 16 indicated to you that both in the Cedillo case and in 17 this case, the case is brought on a single sheet of 18 paper with a headline figure without supporting data 19 and that there is no indication of any evidence having 20 been provided on the presence of measles RNA protein 21 in these samples either. 22 So I think it is rather flimsy evidence to 23 go by, and I would have expected more in a sense from 24 my experience in the U.K. There would have been other 25 data that I would have liked to have seen before.

I know that you've 22 been in the room for at least some of the testimony 23 that you've heard here, but I haven't ha d a chance to 24 introduce myself. Obviously, I'm one of the attorneys 25 representing the Snyder family in this case and Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 91 of 204 906A RIMA - CROSS 1 representing Petitioners at large in the omnibus 2 proceeding. I hav e a few questions for you, and I 3 first want to go to your Slide No. 2 if you have that 4 still available on your laptop? 5 A It's not my laptop. Can you switch it back 6 on? 7 Q If it doesn't come on right away, it's not 8 going to be particularly essential. I know that we 9 have paper copies distributed, and I have just a 10 couple of quick questions. 11 THE COURT: It's like we just hit the logoff 12 issue. There we go. Okay. Now we just need to go 13 back to Slide 2. 14 MR. POWERS: And this would be Slide 2. 15 Okay. Now we don't really have to have it up there. 16 THE COURT: Okay. I have it in front of me, 17 so if you want to go ahead, Mr. Pow ers, that's fine. 18 We're getting close. There we go. One more. Okay. 19 BY MR. POWERS: 20 Q Just a couple of quick questions about this 21 slide. The plotting that's done here, who did these 22 plots? 23 A This is Professor Simmonds who did these 24 plots. 25 Q And what data was Professor Simmonds using Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 92 of 204 907 RIMA - CROSS 1 to plot the graphs that we see here? 2 A He would have been using the same data as I 3 would have been seeing. 4 Q And so the same data that you saw, and the 5 data that he is using here, wh ere did that data come 6 from? 7 A It came from Unigenetics. 8 Q And are there any plots like this that 9 you've introduced into evidence that Professor O'Leary 10 or anybody else at Unigenetics did? 11 A No. 12 Q Now this plotting or the data that the 13 plotting is based on, do you know whether this data 14 w as from any general samples that would have been used 15 to set up assays versus actual patients that were 16 being viewed? 17 A It would involve patients and controls, so 18 i n other words claimants and controls. 19 Q Claimants and controls. So none of this 20 would have been for an assay as it's set up. And 21 what's your basis for knowing that? 22 A My basis for knowing that is that I looked 23 at the same data and I've seen the same results. 24 Q And this is the data that you referred to 25 that is not available? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 93 of 204 908A RIMA - CROSS 1 A (Nonverbal respo nse.) 2 THE COURT: You nodded. Was that a yes? 3 THE WITNESS: Yes. Sorry. I mean in terms 4 of I've seen data for about 300 claimants and 5 children. 6 BY MR. POWERS: 7 Q So you've seen it, Professor Simmonds has 8 seen it, but certainly none of the attorneys here have 9 seen it and the Special Master hasn't seen it? 10 A No. But as far as my concerns, I can say 11 that obviously this is the case of a normal experience 12 that I had where es sentially I had in my report 13 interpretations of data that I've seen but I can't 14 discuss with you. 15 Q Now you made mention of contamination, that 16 you've identified co ntamination issues or claimed to 17 have in the Unigenetics work. I didn't hear you 18 describe contamination in terms of negative controls. 19 Negative controls came up negative when they shouldn't 20 have come up negative, isn't that correct? 21 A Not in all cases because as you correctly 22 remember from Steven Bustin's report, there are 23 certain indications that sometimes positives were 24 ignored under these circumstances. 25 Q And that's based again on data that we don't Heritage Reporting Cor poration (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 94 of 204 909A RIMA - CROSS 1 have available? 2 A Exactly. 3 THE COURT: I'm sorry. I didn't hear that. 4 THE WITNESS: Exactly, yes. 5 THE COURT: Okay. 6 THE WITNESS: I'll speak up. Okay. 7 BY MR. POWERS: 8 Q Actually, before moving off the slides, 9 Slide 4, if you could turn to that, please? 10 A This one? 11 Q Yes , thanks. Now Slide 4 as I understand 12 it, these graphs and these plots, and I should be 13 clear, one is a plot and one is a graph of a standard 14 curve? 15 A Yes. 16 Q The plot and the curve are not based on any 17 data that was contained in the O'Leary work, nothing 18 to do with any data or any samples or controls for 19 this litigation, corr ect? 20 A I only used this particular curve in my 21 report as well to indicate the problem that there is 22 that a lot of extrapolation was being done and values 23 were determined below the lowest point in the standard 24 curve. 25 Q And this material is actually marketing Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 95 of 204 910 RIMA - CROSS 1 material from a company that sells PCR equipment. 2 A It is, yes. Yes. 3 Q I don't know if it's equipment or systems as 4 they call it. 5 A It sells the kits to do it as well as the 6 machine. 7 Q Right. And so the lines that they generate 8 here are essentially self -serving. I mean, they're 9 generating lines to say our curve is flatter than the 10 other guy's c urve. 11 A And the competitor, you're right, is not so 12 flat. 13 Q So this is some marketing material that is 14 illustrative only. 15 A Sur e. 16 Q It doesn't reflect anything about the data 17 in these cases? 18 A No. I only use it in order to illustrate a 19 point and that point is made in my report as w ell that 20 a lot of the data that are provided by Unigenetics 21 involve extrapolations outside the range of standard 22 curve. 23 Q I want to just for a quick moment here step 24 away from the particulars of the testing methodology 25 and PCR that you spent most of the morning talking Heritage Reporting Corporat ion (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 96 of 204 911 RIMA - CROSS 1 about. Do you believe that the presence of measles 2 virus RNA a fter an exposure represents continued 3 measles virus replication? 4 A That depends on under what circumstances you 5 do the testing. We've already inferred that in 6 certain instances, Diane Griffin's (ph) lab has been 7 able to do PCRs and find it positive after 60 or 90 8 days depending on what particular set of patients you 9 look at. If y ou do it under those circumstances, you 10 don't actually know exactly what you have because the 11 RNA itself is not that stable. For the virus to 12 maintain a persistent state, it has to replicate. But 13 you don't know whether you're looking at degraded bits 14 of genome or whether there's still a whole replicating 15 system. 16 Q Exactly. That's what I wanted to get t o. 17 So if you find measles virus RNA in a sample 18 postexposure, it's possible that it would represent, I 19 don't mean to use this in a particularly technical 20 term, but an artifact of previous replication, it 21 might not necessarily be replicating, is that right? 22 If it's imbedded in the cell, it's just survived in a 23 cell that has survi ved? 24 A Well, to an extent, yes, but it depends 25 entirely on the circumstance that you're looking at. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 97 of 204 912A RIMA - CROSS 1 In this particular case, she was looking at HIV 2 positive children, and she found that it was longer 3 than we normally have seen. But what she doesn't 4 know -- 5 Q Right. And just to make clear for the 6 record, I think we're talking about the same thing. 7 This is Dr. Griffin's 2001 paper on the HIV positive 8 versus HIV negative children? 9 A That's right. Yes. 10 Q And I think that was in Cedillo. That was 11 petitioners' Exhibit 112, Tab 1. So in that paper, 12 she determined that through PCR, she identified RNA in 13 the HIV positive children and concluded that 60, maybe 14 even more than th at days out, the virus was 15 replicating in the system. The measles virus was 16 replicating in the system of some of those HIV 17 children. 18 A Yes. My expectation is that she has 19 demonstrated that there is RNA there. 20 Q So the question is does the demonstration of 21 RNA there, does that suggest that replication has 22 taken place? 23 A It's a matter of some uncertainty as to how 24 long RNA that is encapsulated in the nucleocapsid 25 protein of the measles virus can survive without Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 98 of 204 913A RIMA - CROSS 1 replication, okay? But it is very unlikely that that 2 is a very long period. And I must say that we have 3 relatively few data that suggests to us how long long 4 and not so long is. 5 It's very clear that RNA by itself as the 6 naked RNA molecule is quite unstable. It is very 7 quickly hydrolyzed by the hydroxyl groups that are 8 present in the cell's water, and that breaks it down 9 very rapidly. So in order for a virus to stay as an 10 entity, a genetic entity that is capable of 11 replicating itself, it is probably requiring constant 12 replication over whatever, for days, maybe even weeks. 13 I can't say that. We have not really got any data to 14 give us an answer in that particular question. 15 So if you ask me is it necessary for a virus 16 like measles to persist over eight years and that the 17 average is the period between the manifestation of 18 symptoms in SSPE and in the case of the acute 19 infection, then replication must occur. It's not like 20 DNA, which is a very stable molecule. 21 Q Right. 22 A But I don't know. If you ask me the 23 specific question, I cannot tell you whether if you 24 find RNA at Day 90 in an HIV positive child whether 25 that means that there was replication until weeks ago Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 99 of 204 914A RIMA - CROSS 1 or days ago. 2 Q And if you had additional evidence in 3 addition to the RNA and identify specific proteins, 4 would that be helpful in determining whether 5 replication had occurred? So if you found proteins 6 that were further down the chain or beyond IV and 7 moving down that chain of proteins, if you found those 8 along with the RNA, would that bolster the case for 9 persistence in that instance? 10 A It would be helpful, but I don't think that 11 you could ever find that as conclusive evidence. 12 Q And even if not conclusive, if you did find 13 that evidence, would that be through 14 immunohistochemistry? 15 A You could do that by immunohistochemistry, 16 yes. 17 Q And I heard you mention in your direct 18 testimony earlier that the Uhlmann paper did not use 19 immunohistochemistry? 20 A That's right. 21 Q I recall a passage in that paper that says 22 that the results were confirmed by 23 immunohistochemistry? 24 A That's right. 25 Q So it sounds as if they did do Heritage Reporting Corp oration (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 100 of 204 915 RIMA - CROSS 1 immunohistochemistry to generate the results in the 2 Uhlmann paper? 3 A They were not in the Uhlmann paper, and if 4 you read my report, then you'll see that in my 5 redacted report, I posed a large number of questions 6 of the Unig enetics Lab, particularly because it was 7 obviously there for the potential to be used later on 8 in a hearing in the U.K. and to establish what had and 9 what had not been done. And so the importa nt element 10 of that critique that I provided there was that if you 11 confirm something, then please show it to me. 12 I mean, your case would have been stronger 13 if you had protein data, but you don't have that 14 except where we rely on the statement by Dr. Kennedy 15 and we rely on Dr. Bradstreet's paper, which obviously 16 included Colten Snyder for that particular 17 confirmation. But I have never seen any data, and I 18 have good reasons to doubt whether that was actually 19 done properly, because Unigenetics is not a lab that 20 uses immunocy tochemistry. 21 A lot of the so -called confirmatory data 22 that have been provided in this area come from Andy 23 Wakefield, and in the earlier stories that he had 24 about the link between measles or measles vaccines or 25 measles and mumps with inflammatory bowel disease, he Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 101 of 204 916A RIMA - CROSS 1 did try to confirm it through immunocytochemistry. 2 The first case, he used a -- 3 Q Let me interrupt. I was just asking a 4 simple question about whether in the Uhlmann paper 5 they say that their results of PCR were confirmed by 6 immunohistochemistry . 7 A Yes. 8 Q And my only question to you is whether you 9 believe, yes or no, that that's a true statement in 10 the Uhlmann paper? Did they in fact confirm their PCR 11 results with immunohistochemistry? 12 A How could I know it? I've never seen any 13 data. I've never seen any immunocytochemistry data 14 from Uhlmann, from Unigenetics or from Andy Wakefield 15 after the original set of immunocytochemistry data 16 that were based on his theory about inflammatory bowel 17 disease, which was then demonstrated to be wrong in 18 the sense that there is a paper by Iizuka which shows 19 that there is cross -reactivity of the antibody that 20 they had with human antigens. 21 And secondly, in the first instance, and 22 this is when I referred in my direct already to my 23 collaboration with Andy Wakefield, he used a serum 24 which was a serum generated in a mouse by infecting 25 the mouse with an adenovirus that expressed the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 102 of 204 917 RIMA - CROSS 1 measles nucleocapsid gene. 2 Q And that would be the N gene? 3 A The N gene, yes. 4 Q Now a question about the N gene. The N 5 gene, is that the first gene that's produced in the 6 replication cycle of the measles virus? 7 A It is, yes. Yes. 8 Q And a step first in that series? 9 A Yes. 10 Q And the N gene is the one that again you 11 described it as being the highest count? 12 A Copy number, yes. 13 Q Highest copy number. 14 A Yes. 15 Q And that's why I just want to make sure when 16 I say count and copy number, if we're using those 17 terms, are we using the same terms? Does that work 18 for you? 19 A I mean, I would prefer to use the word \"copy 20 number.\" 21 Q Copy number. So for the N gene then, that 22 is the gene you would expe ct to have the highest copy 23 number? 24 A That's right. 25 Q And you describe how in the work here they Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 103 of 204 918 RIMA - CROSS 1 weren't looking for the N gene, is that correct? 2 A That's right. 3 Q And that in fact they were looking for the F 4 gene. In fact, that's what Slide 2 talks about, the 5 search for the F gene. 6 A Yes. 7 Q Now the F gene is much further down the 8 chain of genes that are involved for replicating 9 measles virus, is that right? 10 A In transcription of the virus, yes. 11 Q In transcribing it. And then presumably the 12 presence of F gene would indicate that the sequencing 13 that preceded the F gene, involving N and everything 14 else in between, if you found the F, that would 15 indicate that everything preceding it was there, is 16 that correct? 17 A If you had done the proper tests, and 18 obviously I don't believe that the tests were done 19 properly. 20 Q I'm just talking about the goal. 21 A But the goal, yes. I mean, that would have 22 been the normal expectation, yes. 23 Q Right. And then presumably one might do 24 that to establish or at least make a stronger case for 25 replication so that if you have t he F gene, you might Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 104 of 204 919 RIMA - CROSS 1 be able to make the argument at least as a goal that 2 replication had been taking place in those locations 3 where you found RNA. Does that make sense as a goal 4 approach in a study like this? Looking for the F 5 rather than N if you're looking to find replication? 6 Does that make sense? 7 A No, it doesn't. I'll tell you why. If you 8 first of all wish to establish whether there is 9 measles in a particular sample, you're not immediately 10 concerned whether the question whether it's 11 replicating or if it's transcribing or how active, how 12 much is there, but you also have to give yourself the 13 best chance of finding that particular virus. Then 14 you would go for the N gene. And the Unigenetics 15 people tried to get results for N, F and H. 16 Essentially what they then found was that 17 somehow they were not able to establish a good N gene 18 assay. Clearly they would have liked to have seen the 19 confirmation that all these RNAs would have been 20 there. So if you try in the first instance to say 21 well, is it there or n ot, then you must go for the N 22 gene. You must work very hard to get there. The 23 secondary goal is in terms of looking at whether 24 there's replication or transcription or replication 25 without transcription. That's impossible. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 105 of 204 920A RIMA - CROSS 1 Whether you have transcription without 2 replication, that would all be reasonable to say now 3 I'm starting to look at the other genes. But to take 4 that particular gene as the first target would not be 5 a sensible approach to my mind, and so I know that 6 they tried and they failed. 7 Q And your knowledge is based ag ain on 8 documents that we don't have available here? 9 A Let me think. I would have to check. I'm 10 not sure whether the Uhlmann paper makes a reference 11 to the fact that they tried the other genes, but 12 because as you know, the Uhlmann paper also dealt with 13 the solution phase RT PCR, and the fact that they had 14 tried to use pr iors for the N, the F and the H, and as 15 you know, the Uhlmann paper itself has a list of N, F 16 and H primers. 17 Q Now you talked towards the end of your 18 testimony abou t a meeting that happened where a group 19 of people discussed whether they wanted to proceed 20 with taking new samples from children and running 21 tests on those samples to see if the results could b e 22 replicated. Do you remember that discussion? 23 A Yes. 24 Q And you reported that the upshot of that 25 group's decision was to not go forward with doing Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 106 of 204 921 RIMA - CROSS 1 that, and you described th e reasons for that. I just 2 want to learn a little bit more about that meeting. 3 That meeting was a group of people that were 4 representing the defendants? 5 A Sorry. I might have given the wrong 6 impression about the meeting. At some stage, the 7 legal teams asked us is there any value in asking for 8 samples of these children in order to establish 9 whether the Unigenetics data are correct or can we do 10 something. 11 Q And so I'm really careful here, the legal 12 team that you're describing, you used the word plural, 13 but these weren't legal teams from both sides of the 14 case. This was the legal team that was representing 15 the pharmaceutical companies? 16 A The respondents, right. 17 Q So the direction to have this meeting was 18 not by joint agreement of the parties, but the 19 defendant pharmaceutical companies directed you all to 20 have the meeting. Is that fair so far? 21 A What they asked us was the following 22 question. 23 Q I just want to establish who the \"they\" is. 24 Am I correct in saying that the \"they\" who directed 25 you to have this meeting -- Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 107 of 204 922 RIMA - CROSS 1 A The people who would be representing the 2 respondents in Court, the barristers asked us. 3 Q Okay. Tha t's all I was trying to establish. 4 So those are the people that called the meeting? 5 A Now they didn't call the meeting. 6 Q Who comes to mind? 7 A They asked a question, and I said I'm sorry 8 if I misled you about there having been a meeting. 9 The situation was that a number of us were asked by 10 correspondence do you think it's worth testing the 11 children, and then all of us came to the same 12 conclusion that this was not the way forward. 13 Q And when you say all of us, these would be 14 all retained experts -- 15 A That would be -- 16 Q Let me finish the question, please. 17 A Sorry. 18 Q Thes e would all be paid and retained experts 19 exclusively on the side of the pharmaceutical 20 respondents? 21 A They were. 22 Q And you all in those discussions, or it 23 sounds like there was some consideration given to the 24 children. Did anybody from your side ever contact the 25 families or the people who were responsible for the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 108 of 204 923 RIMA - CROSS 1 children to get their opinion on whether testing would 2 have been appropriate and whether they would have been 3 willing to undergo that? 4 A I think those are matters that I cannot 5 discuss. 6 Q And you cannot discuss these matters because 7 of a seal or confidentiality order imposed? 8 A There's a confidentiality order on a number 9 of the discussions that obviously we had. 10 MR. POWERS: I have no further questions. 11 And Special Master, I think, I mean, we've all stated 12 this on the record. We discussed it and it's come up 13 a couple of times. We will be asking for leave to 14 file a supplemental report here in response to some of 15 the information that's been presented, presuming that 16 we can get a hold of some of this underlying 17 documentation from the United Kingdom litigation. 18 THE COURT: Let me deal with the second part 19 of that first. Are you going to request unsealing of 20 the British l itigation, of additional portions of the 21 British litigation? 22 MR. POWERS: Yes, we are, Special Master. 23 THE COURT: And when are you going to do 24 that? 25 MR. POWERS: That process has begun. We Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 109 of 204 924 RIMA - CROSS 1 have inquiries to the court in the U.K. and we are 2 initiating that, that proceeding. 3 THE COURT: Okay. Again, I'm going to ask 4 when, bec ause you were invited, in fact encouraged, in 5 fact all three Special Masters dealing with this 6 litigation in Court said we would join with you back 7 five months ago to get the complete data. We've had 8 five months and it appears that the Petitioners have 9 sat on their hands. So when? 10 MR. POWERS: I just honestl y don't know what 11 the timeline is. I know that in the U.K. system, I 12 mean, it's taken weeks literally just to get a copy of 13 the order. 14 THE COURT: A copy of which order? 15 MR. POWERS: The confidentiality order. 16 They don't just send it over. I honestly don't know 17 and cannot represent to you today how long that 18 process will take. 19 THE COURT: Well, I'm discouraged from the 20 testimony of Dr. Kennedy, who told me that he had not 21 been asked to request disclosure of his report prior 22 to his testimony here in this case from me. The whole 23 discussion of this prior to the start of the Cedillo 24 trial is Mr. Matanos ki described the process the 25 government went through to get records unsealed, that Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 110 of 204 925 RIMA - CROSS 1 they approached their expert witnesses and asked them 2 to join in the request to unseal that testimony and 3 that the Petitioners have not taken that step. 4 This is concerning to me because we would 5 like to get a speedy resolution of not only Colten's 6 case and Michelle Cedillo's case and Yates Hazlehurst's 7 case but all of these cases. 8 MR. POWERS: Understood. 9 THE COURT: So, while I'm putting you on 10 notice that you've got to move on this, we're not 11 going to tolerate sitting on our hands. 12 MR. POWERS: Understood. 13 THE COURT: Okay. You have no other 14 questions for this witness? 15 MR. POWERS: No other questions for this 16 witness, no, Special Master. 17 THE COURT: Okay. I have a few, Dr. Rima. 18 Let me ask this question this way. You heard Dr. 19 Kennedy's testimony about Dr. O'Leary's current 20 activities. That is, he's recently published several 21 articles involving RT PCR. I think Dr. Logan is the 22 lead author on those articles. And you've heard that 23 he was recently awarded the St. Luke's Medal by the 24 Royal Academy of Medicine and St. Luke's Hospital and 25 that he is the chair of pathology at Trinity College, Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 111 of 204 926 RIMA - CROSS 1 Dublin. 2 Publications, awards, university chairs 3 don't seem to square to me with the picture you've 4 painted of what happened in the Unigenetics O'Leary 5 Lab. Can you shed any light for this on me? 6 THE WITNESS: I am not on the award panels 7 that have made these awards. I have not been asked to 8 be an external exami ner or a person on the Trinity 9 College appointment panel. So, of course, that 10 particular appointment took place well before 11 Unigenetics started to work, because he was appointed 12 quite a long time ago to his professorship. 13 THE COURT: The chairmanship? 14 THE WITNESS: The chairmanship. 15 THE COURT: Okay. 16 T HE WITNESS: So I have no observations to 17 make. If I was on the St. Luke's award panel, then I 18 could tell you on what basis they made that decision. 19 THE COURT: Okay. Well, let me phrase the 20 question this way. We've heard that contamination is 21 not unusual in labs doing PCR, is that correct? 22 THE WITNESS: It is correct, and I certainly 23 have experienced it myself, as I identified in my 24 report. 25 THE COURT: Can you square the problems in Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 112 of 204 927A RIMA - CROSS 1 the O'Leary lab that you discussed and Dr. Simmonds 2 and Dr. Bustin have d iscussed in testimony and reports 3 with mere contamination or mere carelessness? 4 THE WITNESS: What I provided evidence of is 5 carelessness in certain instances. I provided you 6 this morning with evidence where I found some 7 practices are unacceptable as a scientist. And that's 8 all I can say. 9 THE COURT: I think that answers my 10 question, Dr. Rima. At the time Colten's samples or 11 Michelle Cedillo's samples were sent to the O'Leary 12 Lab, were there other labs doing PCR of cerebrospinal 13 fluid, whole b lood for a measles virus or was this the 14 only lab doing it at the time? 15 THE WITNESS: It was the only lab. Let me 16 explain this. I mean, if the technology had been 17 validated, then Dr. O'Leary would have found me and 18 Oldstone and several other people interested in 19 measles virus at his door saying, can you help us 20 resolve issues about not only this disease. I can 21 give you other diseases where there is a question 22 about the formation of measles virus in -- disease, in 23 otosclerosis. And I'm invol ved in several of these 24 instances where people are struggling to try to find a 25 link or an etiology for a disease which has no known Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 113 of 204 928A RIMA - CROSS 1 etiology. 2 And so, if indeed that technology had been 3 validated, if that indeed had been the circumstance, a 4 lot of people would have knocked on O'Leary's lab and 5 said you can do something which we can't do. And 6 there would ha ve been a flood of people coming to him 7 independent of the litigation of some. 8 But that flood hasn't taken place for the 9 very simple reason that everyone who has looked at it 10 said, no, actually, this technology does not work. 11 What he claims he can do he cannot do. What he 12 claims, he simply has not been able to give us the 13 sort of confidence in his tec hnology that would allow 14 us to start looking at it from a research perspective. 15 That's a research perspective. That is a very 16 different perspective even from the perspective of a 17 diagnostic lab that is going to test children for 18 pathological conditions that there are. 19 So I would have said I would have been the 20 first at his door. I mean, he is only 100 miles down 21 the line from me and it would have been great. I'd 22 like to work with this person. But it was clear that 23 the company that was set up by Unigenetics had only 24 one trading activity and that was to test measles 25 presence in samples from the litigants in the U.K. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 114 of 204 929 RIMA - CROSS 1 And so essentially when people started to 2 look at it and when experts came in, measles experts 3 came into the field, we tried to get as many people 4 involved. On both sides, attempts were made to 5 involve people. We came quickly to the conclusion 6 that some of the pract ices that I described here, some 7 of the sloppiness, some of the inconsistencies in the 8 data were there and they led us to the conclusion that 9 this simply does not work. 10 THE COURT: You've characterized the reports 11 of measles virus in Colten s headline reports. 12 THE WITNESS: Yes. 13 THE COURT: And in the ordinary course of my 14 work, I rely on headline reports. I mean, I don't ask 15 the lab at whatever institution has tested blood for 16 the presence of whatever we might be looking for, a 17 virus, a bacteria, whatever might be at issue in our 18 case. I mean, I look at headline reports routinely. 19 As I understand what you just told me, it is the 20 nature of or the purpose for which this lab was 21 established as well as the practices of the lab that 22 leads you to question the reliability of the results 23 in Colten's case? 24 THE WIT NESS: Yes. 25 Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 115 of 204 930 RIMA - CROSS 1 THE COURT: And that you would not routinely 2 question a headline report. 3 THE WITNESS: Well, I'm obviously not in 4 your position and so I don't know what I would 5 question. I mean, I'm a scientist. I question 6 everything that comes on my desk and -- 7 THE COURT: Okay. 8 THE WITNESS: -- in the first instance do 9 not believe it until I'm convinced that I can. And in 10 that sense, it was clear experience that we had once 11 we started to look at that. It was c lear that we 12 couldn't rely on what was made available to us. 13 But why I call it a headline is because that 14 is based on two figures, a numerator and a 15 denominator, which could be both small and both -- and 16 multiply up, one small figure divided by an even 17 smaller figure gives you quite a large figure, leads 18 to a completely and utterly biologically implausible 19 situation where as I said, if you come forward with a 20 situation where you have two times 10 to the second 21 copies per nanogram, that means that that whole cell 22 is stuffed with measles F messenger RNA, let alone the 23 fact that Mr. Powers has already indicated that 24 actually it also had N and P and H and L as well. And 25 so essentially what we are seeing is something that is Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 116 of 204 931A RIMA - CROSS 1 biologically, that's all I'll say, implausible. 2 A cell normally has about 200,000 copies of 3 message. So, if you say to me that this sample 4 contains two times 10 t o the second per nanogram, that 5 is 200,000 copies of measles F. There is no space, no 6 availability for the housekeeping gene that needs to 7 be there, for the other genes of measles that need to 8 be there. So it is simply impossible to have these 9 figures. And that is where when figures like that 10 came out in the Uhlmann paper, I said this is 11 nonsense. 12 THE COURT: So, when you say \"these 13 figures,\" you're referring to the figures in some the 14 papers and in some of the data you have seen and the 15 graphs. 16 THE WITNESS: That's right. And I gave you 17 the example of the Uhlmann paper and the Bradstreet 18 paper where figures like that became very implausible. 19 TH E COURT: But in Colten's specific case, 20 are the figures beyond plausibility? 21 THE WITNESS: Well, he has 34,000 copies per 22 nanogram of RNA in his CSF. If I calculate that on a 23 cellular basis, and I have already indicated why I do 24 that, because I have no indication that free virus is 25 there, if we do that, then he has about 3,400 copies Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 117 of 204 931B RIMA - CROSS 1 of measles F per cell.

In order 4 to put that in context, I refer you to the fact t hat 5 there's a paper by Catanial (ph), which is in my 6 report which actually has measured copy numbers by 7 other technologies than Taqman, and they come to a 8 conclusion that i n circumstances where I take my best 9 virus, the lab adapted Edmonston strains, which grow 10 much better than the wild type, in vero cells, which 11 is a cell that has no innate immunity and therefore is 12 capable of allowing the replication of a virus to 13 occur, in those conditions, I can get up to about 14 4,000 copies of me asles F. 15 THE COURT: So we have a factor of seven? 16 THE WITNESS: No, we have 3,400 in Colten 17 Snyder. I had 4,000 in my best case of growing. So I 18 woul d say if that's the case, we have no difficulty in 19 saying take those cells, grow up the virus and look at 20 immunocytochemistry, because this would be analogous 21 to my best, to what I could grow b est in the cell. 22 THE COURT: Okay. So this is just too high? 23 THE WITNESS: Too high. 24 THE COURT: Too high to be believed? 25 THE WITNESS: Indeed.

BABCOCK: A few. 3 REDIRECT EXAMINATION 4 BY MS. BABCOCK: 5 Q Dr. Rima, to your knowledge, have any of 6 Professor O'Leary's recent publications or awards 7 dealt with his measles PCR research? 8 A No, they haven't. They have done some 9 publications on DNA viruses, which I've already 10 indicated PCR is extremely sensitive and there is no 11 question that you can pick up one copy. And the 12 latest paper has dealt with the diagnosis of a number 13 of viruses in stools of patients, and these viruses 14 are present in immense copy numbers in the stools. 15 These are norov iruses and also viruses where 16 essentially you have 10 to the 11th, 10 to the 12th 17 copies of free virus in the stools. And therefore, it 18 is not surprising that you can use this technology to 19 make that diagnosis. 20 THE COURT: Just a second. By \"free virus,\" 21 you mean not present in a cell? 22 THE WITNESS: Not replicating, simply \"free 23 virus.\" 24 THE COURT: Okay. 25 THE WITNESS: If you look at stool samples Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 120 of 204 934 RIMA - REDIRECT 1 of patients with that type of diarrhea, you only see 2 virus practically. It's very infectious, as all of us 3 know who go on cruises on the wrong ship. 4 THE COURT: Just ensuring I understood the 5 distinction between free virus and cellular virus. 6 THE WITNESS: Yes. 7 THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead. 8 BY MS. BABCOCK: 9 Q Now there was some discussion on cross of 10 the meeting that you mentioned on direct, and you sort 11 of cut it off because your really didn't want to go 12 into much more detail. But am I correct, on your 13 direct examination, in talking about this inquiry into 14 whether you were going to try and replicate the tests 15 on the claimants themselves that part of the reason, a 16 big part of the reason was because you didn't think it 17 was medically or ethically justified? 18 A Uh -huh. 19 Q That's correct. And that was already your 20 testimony here today? 21 A Well, it is also I think I don't know to 22 what extent it was part of the record, but a number of 23 CSF samples were sought after because the claimants 24 then wished to start to find evidence for their 25 conjecture that there was direct brain infection. And Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 121 of 204 935A RIMA - REDIRECT 1 so similar to the U.S. cases where CSF samples were 2 available, they were not in the original cases in the 3 U.K. And essentially people having looked at that 4 found that no laboratory in the U.K. was willing to 5 take CSF samples from these children because they did 6 not feel that there was sufficient ethical background 7 to validate or t o justify taking those samples. And 8 the children had to travel to the U.S., and I don't 9 know where the sample was taken. 10 Q Now Mr. Powers also asked you about the 11 immunohistochemistry in Uhlmann, and I wanted to make 12 sure, is there anything else you wanted to add about 13 why you're not confident in the immunohistochemistry 14 done here? 15 A Well, I mean, the Bradstreet paper is sort 16 of referring to the fact that there might be 17 immunocytochemistry done, but -- 18 Q And let me be clear, it sounds sort of like 19 immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry are 20 interchangeable? 21 A They're the same. 22 Q Okay. 23 A So, no, it hasn't been done. And it's 24 surprising to me. This is why I come back to the 25 question of the headline figure being the only thing Heritage R eporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 122 of 204 936 RIMA - REDIRECT 1 available. If you had data on the presence of measles 2 protein being in the CSF of these children, then I 3 think it should have been presented to courts. 4 Q Now your report and your testimony today 5 accurately summarize your concer ns about Unigenetics, 6 correct? 7 A Uh -huh. 8 THE COURT: And that was a yes? 9 THE WITNESS: Yes, sorry. 10 THE COURT: Okay. 11 MS. BABCOCK: Thank you. Sorry. 12 THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I'm learning 13 slowly. 14 BY MS. BABCOCK : 15 Q And this additional data that keeps getting 16 referenced and that you can't talk about, this just 17 provides more support for your opinions? 18 A On the basis of my redacted report, I hope 19 to convince the Court that there were a number of 20 questions about practices, consistency of the data and 21 questions of contamination, et cetera, that would say 22 to me there is a question about the quality of the 23 material that has been provided in addition to the 24 fact that there is not the sort of background 25 information that we have seen available to us from the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 123 of 204 937 RIMA - REDIRECT 1 other claimants in the U.K. That would have specified 2 the cycle number for GAPDH in that run, what the 3 standards were doing in that run, what the standards 4 for measles F we re doing on that plate where the 5 sample was, how many positives were there on that 6 particular plate on that particular day, and the 7 actual copy numbers, which would have given rise to 8 the headline figure. 9 So this is where I think first of all I 10 question the plausibility of these figures. Secondly, 11 I then question the basis on which that figure has 12 been derived. I think I simply don't have the data. 13 Part of being a scientist is trying to get confidence 14 in the tests that are being presented to you, and all 15 I have been able to say is that I from my experience 16 in that U.K. litigation without having to disclose any 17 confidential data say that I have no confidence in 18 what I saw, and therefore, I said that b y extension, I 19 simply cannot take on good faith value the data that 20 we have seen in the cases of Cedillo and Colten 21 Snyder. 22 MS. BABCOCK: I have no further questions. 23 MR. POWERS: Just one quick one to follow up 24 on there. 25 THE COURT: Certainly.

Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 127 of 204 941A WARD - DIRECT 1 Q And you've of course also reviewed the 2 medical records and materials in Cedillo? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And I should say as Mr. Powers did earlier, 5 do you incorporate your opinion in Cedillo by 6 reference in this testimony as well? 7 A Yes, of course. 8 Q And therefore, we're going to attempt not to 9 replicate that testimony again. But here in this 10 case, again, there's been some effort to use SSPE and 11 MIBE as models for Colten Snyder. I even think at one 12 point in Colten's medical records, they were working 13 him up for SSPE. What is the clinical picture of 14 someone with SSPE? 15 A Well, as Dr. Rima said, the most common 16 clinical picture is a period of confusing clinical 17 presentation, typically at least five to seven years 18 after wild -type measles, and often a diagnosis is not 19 immediately entertained. But after a period of 20 progressive clinical deterioration, then somebody 21 thinks of the diagnos is and the diagnosis is made. 22 And so far the individuals with SSPE progress and 23 actually lead to death. 24 Q And is there inflammation in the brains of 25 people with SS PE? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 128 of 204 942A WARD - DIRECT 1 A Well, ther e's surprisingly little 2 inflammation. That's one of the things that people 3 don't really understand why there is so little 4 inflammation in the brains of these individuals. But 5 it's not extensive inflammation that you would see 6 from an acute viral encephalitis or bacterial 7 meningitis, for example. 8 Q Now ADEM or PIEM, can they be associated 9 with measles virus? 10 A Yes. They are also reported to occur after 11 wild -type measles virus and may very rarely occur 12 following vaccine exposures. 13 Q Is Colten Snyder's clinical picture 14 consistent with ADEM? 15 A Not at all. 16 Q Now Dr. Kinsbourne discussed a 2004 17 editorial by Paul Dyken discussing a condition called 18 MINE, which I believe is measles -induced neuroautistic 19 encephalopathy. It's a paper that was actually 20 introduced on the last day of the Cedillo trial, 21 actually during Diane Griffin's cross if I recall, and 22 hadn't been previously referenced by any of the 23 experts. Do you think this theory as offered in the 24 editorial by Dr. Dyken is scientifically sound? 25 A No. It's quite an amusing acronym because Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 129 of 204 943A WARD - DIRECT 1 it's sort of laying claim to an acronym that seems 2 quite possessive. But in this particular instance, it 3 seems that Dr. Dyken simply took articles that were in 4 the literature in a completely noncritical way and 5 said, well, if this is true and this is true and this 6 is true, then there might be this new thing that I'm 7 going to call MINE. And it was only subsequent to 8 that publication, which was in a fairly obscure 9 medical journal, that many of the problems with the 10 hypothesis became apparent, and Dr. Dyken hasn't said 11 anything else about this since then. 12 Q And sort of following up on that, to your 13 own knowledge, was this editori al written before 14 information came out in the U.K. MMR litigation that 15 caused funding to be withdrawn? 16 A Yes, it was. I'm not sure. I don't recall 17 when it was submitted, but it was certainly published 18 prior to the suspension of the U.K. litigation. 19 Q Now, switching topics, is IVIG a treatment 20 commonly used for wild measles virus infection? 21 A Almost never except in the very unusual 22 circumstance of a baby, a newborn baby, who is exposed 23 to a mother who develops measles either in the last 24 few days of the pregnancy or in the first weeks to 25 months after delivery of the child. And the reason Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 130 of 204 944A WARD - DIRECT 1 that it's used in those circumstances is because the 2 maternal antibody generally protects the child during 3 the first four to eight months of life, and if the 4 mother develops acute measles, then she obviously 5 could not have transmitted any of those protective 6 antibodies to her chi ld. 7 Also, the mother is in close contact with 8 the baby and so there is a virtual certainty of 9 transmission to the child. In that case, IVIG is 10 occasionally used to give the baby a better chance, 11 because the mortality from natural disease is very, 12 very high in very young infants. 13 Q So when it's used there, d oes IVIG contain 14 measles neutralizing antibodies? 15 A Yes, it does. In North America and I think 16 also in Europe but certainly for North America, the 17 FDA requires that IVIG formulations of different lots 18 have a minimal amount of antibodies directed against 19 common childhood exanthems. 20 Q Do these levels fluctuate de pending on the 21 batch or source of the IVIG? 22 A Oh, absolutely. That's why the FDA made 23 that requirement of minimal amounts, because people 24 were using these products assuming that they all have 25 lots of measles or varicella or other antibodies. And Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 131 of 204 945A WARD - DIRECT 1 when it was discovered that in fact they didn't, in 2 some cases, some lots had very low measles antibodies, 3 the FDA required that there be a certain minimal 4 level. But there's wide variability above that 5 minimal level so that some lots have much more anti - 6 measles antibodies than other lots. 7 Q So, because of that, if you were using IVIG 8 to treat a purportedly persistent measles virus 9 infection, would it be important to take titer levels 10 before you administe r the IVIG? 11 A Sure. Well if you've got a choice of lots. 12 It would be I would think a very reasonable precaution 13 to take to use the lot that had the highest titers and 14 make sure that you had enough of it to treat the 15 individual for a period of time. Basically buy as 16 much of it as you thought you would need. 17 Q Now is IVIG ever used to treat MIBE? 18 A No, because most people don't believe that 19 that's an active measles -- oh, measles inclusion body 20 encephalitis, yes, sorry. Yes, rarely. Not really. 21 In the case of individuals with MIBE, they might 22 actually use it as a temporizing measure to see if 23 they could actually protect the individual for a long 24 enough period of ti me for their immune system to come 25 back. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 132 of 204 946A WARD - DIRECT 1 Q And even with the use of IVIG, what is the 2 usual course for someone with MIBE? 3 A Well, most individuals with MIBE will die. 4 And IVIG can temporize for a while and if the 5 immunosuppression that allowed them to be susceptible 6 to that manifestation cannot be reversed, then even in 7 the presence of IVIG, the most likely outcome is that 8 they will probably die as well. 9 Q Is there evidence that wild -type measles 10 virus actually cures some autoimmu ne diseases? 11 A Yes, that's one of the sort of interesting 12 little things about measles is that there's limited 13 but some quite consistent literature of children who 14 have well -defined autoimmune conditions prior to the 15 development of wild -type measles, and then after wild - 16 type measles, the disease is either suppressed for a 17 long period of time or goes away. They're permanently 18 cured. 19 Q Now, in his original opinion, and I realize 20 he's been put forth as the treating doctor, not as an 21 official exper t, but certainly he wrote several expert 22 opinions. Dr. Bradstreet cites to Dr. Singh, several 23 papers by Dr. Singh. We certainly know that Dr. Singh 24 gave some testimony on Colten Snyder here. Are the 25 tests that Dr. Singh did on Colten Snyder consistent Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 133 of 204 947 WARD - DIRECT 1 with what you understand Petitioners theory to be in 2 this case? 3 A Well, I said many times that I'm often not 4 really sure what the Petitioners' theories are. There 5 seem to be many of them in Dr. Bradstreet's written 6 statements. But if the simplified position is that 7 you have a persisting measles virus infection that 8 somehow causes autistic spectrum disorder, then I 9 don't see any support for this hypothesis in Dr. 10 Singh's work or in Dr. Bradstreet's argume nts. 11 Q Did Dr. Singh test Colten's CSF for measles 12 virus antibodies? 13 A Yes, he did. 14 Q And what were the results? 15 A That result was negative. 16 Q Now Dr. Bradstreet's explanation for the 17 negative tests is that Colten received IVIG treatment 18 not long before the sample was d rawn. Is this 19 explanation persuasive to you? 20 A Well, not at all, because the half -life of 21 antibodies is typically stated to be four weeks and 22 certainly if they're made by the individual. And so 23 if you are making antibodies, you wouldn't expect them 24 just to disappear. The mother gives a child IgG just 25 prior to delivery, and those antibodies last typical ly Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 134 of 204 948A WARD - DIRECT 1 eight to nine months. And so, if Colten had 2 antibodies in his brain, in his CSF rather, one 3 wouldn't expect them simply to turn on or off like a 4 switch with IVIG administratio n. 5 Q Now Dr. Kinsbourne cited to work by Dr. 6 Pardo particularly on page 17 of his report. And in 7 the middle there, he discusses it as evidence that 8 some scientists may believe that environmental toxins 9 or infections in the presence of genetic 10 susceptibility can lead to neuroinflammation and 11 autism. Is Dr. Pardo's laboratory actively studying 12 potential environmental causes of autism? 13 A Yes. 14 Q And are Dr. Pardo or his colleague, I 15 believe Dr. Swado (ph), considering the MMR vaccine or 16 measles virus in their research? 17 A No, they're not. They're not testing for 18 measles virus. 19 Q Now is the theory being proposed here that 20 measles virus persists in the human and eventually 21 results in autism consistent with any condition 22 associated with wild or vaccine strain measles virus? 23 A Sorry. Could you repeat the question? 24 Q The theory being proposed here that measles 25 virus persists in the system and eventually results in Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 135 of 204 949A WARD - DIRECT 1 autism consistent with any condition associated with 2 wild or vaccine strain measles? 3 A Not that I'm aware of. To my knowledge, 4 there's no convincing evidence whatsoever that 5 exposure to wild -type measles is associated with 6 autism a t all. Given the number of children who 7 experience wild -type measles in the world still half a 8 million cases, and certainly it's assumed that 9 virtually everybody in the world prior to the 10 introduction of the vaccine experienced wild -type 11 disease, the silence in the medical literature on any 12 association between wild -type measles and autism is 13 striking. 14 It's not an association that would have been 15 missed because wild -type measles came in waves, and 16 normally, for example, the east coast of the U.S. had 17 an outbreak of mea sles with thousands of cases in the 18 1990s. The eastern province of Canada had a similar 19 outbreak at that time. Many children were infected 20 with measles in a relatively short period of time, a nd 21 there wasn't a sudden burst in autism in either Canada 22 or the States following those very well -defined 23 outbreaks of measles in societies that certainly had 24 the tools to do surveillance for things like autism. 25 Q Now moving on to the Unigenetics testing, Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 62 8-4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 136 of 204 950 WARD - DIRECT 1 and again, you testified about a lot of this in 2 Cedillo. We're not going to duplicate that here. But 3 talking about Colten Snyder specifically, I believe 4 that even Petitioners' experts concede that at best, 5 Colten Snyder's gut biopsy is borderline positive, or 6 I think Dr. Ke nnedy actually stated he wouldn't have 7 confidence that measles virus was actually in Colten's 8 gut. Do you agree? 9 A Well, I mean, I think with what Dr. Rima 10 just explained to the Court, it's impossible to have 11 confidence in either of those results because it's 12 entirely plausible that the very high titers that one 13 saw in what wer e reported in the CSF were simply the 14 result of very, very low copy numbers that were then 15 multiplied enormously by a very low GAPDH copy number 16 value. So I would say that if Dr. Kennedy has 17 difficulty believing the gut results, I would hope 18 that after the testimony of Dr. Rima, he has a similar 19 level of concerns about the CSF reported values. 20 Q Now Dr. Rima talked about this this morning, 21 that with the positive, markedly positive, what were 22 reported to very highly positive CSF and negative 23 whole blood results, there might be a logical 24 inconsistency there. Do you agree? 25 A Sure. Measles is essentially a completely Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 137 of 204 951A WARD - DIRECT 1 cell -associated virus. There is very little evidence 2 of virus living outside of the cells. Obviously, it 3 has to move from cell to cell at some point, but it 4 does that with enormous efficiency, almost frightening 5 efficiency. And so a virus that's released by a cell 6 breaking would enter into another cell essentially 7 instantaneously. And so, when people have looked to 8 isolate virus from, for example, blood, you can't 9 isolate the virus from the plasma. You can only 10 isolate the virus from the cells. 11 In an individual with some degree of 12 neuroinflammation or even without any inflammation, 13 the only cells that are floating around in the 14 cerebrospinal fluid are the lymphoid cells, the white 15 blood cells, and, yes, those are the same white blood 16 cells that are in the blood. So, if you have 17 extremely high copy numbers in the white blood cells 18 in the brain, it is completely logically inconsistent 19 that you would not see those have the same virus in 20 the white blood cells in the peripheral circulation. 21 Q Now is it accurate to say that PCR can be 22 useful as a diagnostic tool and a research tool? 23 A Sure. 24 Q What was Unigenetics using its testing for 25 in this circumstance? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 138 of 204 952A WARD - DIRECT 1 A Well, I think quite clearly they were using 2 it as a diagnostic tool. They were reporting results 3 that were spec ific to an individual child. 4 Q When you're using something as a diagnostic 5 tool, what's an acceptable rate of false positives? 6 A Well, I could turn that question around to 7 the Court, but really if it's me being diagnosed with 8 a serious condition, I'd like it to be as close to 100 9 percent sensitive and specific as possible. Very few 10 tests actu ally achieve that rate of sensitivity and 11 specificity, but all competent labs strive to make 12 their tests that sensitive and that specific. And 13 some of them come remarkably close. 14 I think if you imagine if a test gave out 10 15 percent false positive results, on the one hand, you'd 16 say, well, gosh, they got it right 90 percent of the 17 time. But, on the oth er hand, if that test is HIV and 18 it's you, that's a completely unacceptable rate of 19 false positives, because one in ten individuals would 20 be falsely informed that they have HIV, for example. 21 Q Have you recently had occasion to speak with 22 Michael Oldstone about Unigenetics? 23 A Well, yes, I did with some fear and 24 trepidation in fact, because as a gr aduate student and 25 also as a postdoctoral fellow working in Diane Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 139 of 204 953A WARD - DIRECT 1 Griffin's lab, I had occasion to witness Michael 2 Oldstone taking apart a fellow trainee in a session in 3 Philadelphia in fact. And I came out of the session 4 and asked in a loud whisper, is Michael Oldstone 5 always such a blank, deleted for the purposes of the 6 transcript, and it turned out my friend went like this 7 and he was standing right behind the door. 8 So he has quite a reputation for remembering 9 things like that and tak ing people's heads off. So I 10 was a little hesitant to call him, but I decided to 11 call him and ask because I thought he might be 12 interested in knowing the extent to which some of the 13 experts in the Snyder case were using his work to 14 support their hypothesis. 15 Q And I believe it's been noted it was also 16 used quite extensively in Cedillo, correct? 17 A It was used extensively in Cedillo. So I 18 plucked up my courage and I was both reassured and a 19 little humbled by the fact that of course he'd 20 completely forgotten who I was. And so my comment 21 after the meeting was I guess not very memorable for 22 him. It was memorable for me. But I asked him if he 23 was aware of how his data was being used and I thought 24 misinterpreted. And then he told me about his 25 interaction with Dr. O'Leary and Wakefield in the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 140 of 204 954A WARD - DIRECT 1 early 2000s. 2 Q I guess you should maybe even explain what 3 exactly happened. 4 A Well, I only know what Dr. Wakefield told me 5 over the phone, which was -- 6 Q Dr. Oldstone? 7 A Sorry, Dr. Oldstone. 8 Q You said Dr. Wakefield. 9 A Oh, right. Dr. Oldstone, sorry. I only 10 know what he told me over the phone. I took notes 11 during the meeting, during the teleph one conversation. 12 And essentially he was approached by a politician, a 13 California politician, Mr. Rollins I believe, who was 14 associated with the MIND Institute, and at the behest 15 of Andrew Wakefield, they wanted to encourage Dr. 16 Oldstone to work with Drs. O'Leary and Wakefield to 17 assess the hypothesis of the persistence of measles 18 virus in individuals with autistic spectrum disorder. 19 Q So was this testing funded by the MIND 20 Institute? 21 A Yes. What Dr. Oldstone said was probably 22 what all researchers say: if yo u want me to do 23 something, can you fund me to do this. And what he 24 asked specifically was for funding for a postdoctoral 25 fellow to work in his lab for a period of time to Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 141 of 204 955A WARD - DIRECT 1 prepare samples and send them to Dr. O'Leary 's 2 laboratory in a coded, blended fashion. 3 Q What were the results of this exercise? 4 A Again, according to Dr. Oldstone, a number 5 of samples were prepared from different tissues and 6 also different in vitro infected cell lines so that 7 uninfected cell lines and uninfected tissues -- the 8 tissues that were used here were from -- transgenic 9 mouse model where he put the gene for one of the 10 receptors for the virus into a mouse so he could 11 infect some tissues in the mouse. And so he was able 12 to send, for example, some gut tissue, some brain 13 tissue. 14 But he used measles virus to infect some of 15 the mouse tissues and some of the in vitro cell 16 cultures at different levels of infection, and these 17 blinded samples were sent to Dr. O'Leary's lab. And 18 then both Dr. O'Leary and Dr. Oldstone together 19 unblinded the set of specimens to find out how well 20 the O'Leary Lab had done. 21 Q And how well had they done? 22 A About 80 percent accuracy. About 80 percent 23 of the samples were correctly identified as being 24 either positive or negative, but about 10 percent were 25 found to be false positive, so there was no virus Heritage Repo rting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 142 of 204 956A WARD - DIRECT 1 present, but O'Leary Lab reported that there was. And 2 others which had virus, in some cases high titer 3 virus, were reported as negative. Dr. Oldstone's 4 recollection was that it was 50 -50. About half of the 5 incorrectly classif ied samples were false positive and 6 the other half were false negative. 7 Q Now, as a scientist and someone who performs 8 PCR, is this an acceptable rate? Is 20 percent 9 acceptable in doing testing for the purposes 10 Unigenetics was doing it? 11 A Well, it's not even acceptable in a research 12 lab. If one had an assay that was giving you both 13 false positives and false negatives, you'd fix the 14 assay as opposed to continuing to do research with it, 15 because you're going to have a guaranteed 20 percent 16 inaccuracy in whatever you're doing. It's wildly 17 inappropriate for a diagnostic lab, any lab, let me 18 rephrase that if the only test availbale to you is 19 this test. 20 Then under certain circumstances, you could 21 justify doing that test. But the results of that test 22 that were only 80 percent accurate would have to be 23 sent out with a big red warnin g saying be aware that 24 this test is wrong 20 percent of the time. And then 25 the clinicians can make a decision based on what Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 143 of 204 956B WARD - DIRECT 1 they're getting and based on the reliability of the 2 assay. Of course, that was never done by the O'Leary 3 Lab. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 144 of 204 957 WARD - DIRECT 1 Q Did Dr. Oldstone try to publish the results? 2 A Well, actually the story wasn't finished, 3 because after the first round of testing, Dr. Oldstone 4 and Dr. O'Leary, neither of them was happy. And so 5 according to Dr. Oldstone, there was an agreement 6 again between the two them that t hey should do it 7 again, that Dr. O'Leary was going to try to make the 8 assays work better. And so another set of samples was 9 prepared by the postdoctoral fellow. Again, they were 10 sent to Dr. O'Leary's laboratory. And again, the 11 results were jointly unblinded by Dr. O'Leary and Dr. 12 Oldstone, and once again, the samples were found to be 13 only about 80 percent accurately diagnosed. And 14 again, there was about 50 -50 false positive and false 15 negative. 16 If this wasn't troubling enough, Dr. 17 Oldstone did something that was I think quite careful. 18 He took some of the samples that had been called false 19 positive or false negative in the first go -around, the 20 same identical samp les, these were not new samples, 21 but the same identical samples were given new code 22 numbers and sent back. So the same identical samples 23 were sent back, and in several instances, samples that 24 had been false positive now became false negative and 25 others that had been false negative now became false Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 145 of 204 958A WARD - DIRECT 1 positive. And at that point, Dr. Oldstone said that 2 he was no longer interested in collaborating and 3 suggested that the results should be published. 4 Q And was Dr. Oldstone successful in that 5 effort? 6 A He was not. He made a fundamental error I 7 think of trust in not having a pregranting agreement, 8 which is fairly standard actually, where the 9 investigator has the right to publish the results even 10 if the sponsor does n't like them. He did not have 11 that agreement with the MIND Institute and he was 12 unable to publish these results. 13 Q Is it fair to say that officials, Dr. 14 O'Leary and people in his camp, were unhappy with the 15 results? 16 A I'm not sure how anyone could possibly be 17 happy with the results. 18 Q Now , in his testimony on Tuesday, Dr. 19 Kennedy suggested that some of the problems might have 20 actually been because of contamination in Dr. 21 Oldstone's lab. What's your reaction? 22 A I'm sure Dr. Oldstone has had contamination 23 in his lab. As Dr. Rima said, we all have. Anybody 24 who works with PCR has to deal with contamination. It 25 happens all the time. The q uality of the lab is not Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 146 of 204 958B WARD - DIRECT 1 in whether you have contamination or not, but it's how Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 147 of 204 959 WARD - DIRECT 1 respond to that contamination. If you respond by 2 ignoring negative controls that go positive, that is 3 not a responsible reaction. If you try to figure out 4 where the contamination is coming from and fix it, 5 then of course it's entirely possible that there may 6 have been some contamination in Dr. Oldstone's 7 laboratory at some point. But he is one of the I 8 think most meticulous scientists I know, know of, I 9 don't even know him, and has a track record of more 10 than 50 years of high -quality, high -impact publication 11 in this area using a huge variety of technologies, 12 including PCR. So, if there was contamination in Dr. 13 Oldstone's la boratory, I would have I think very close 14 to complete confidence that he would do whatever he 15 could to fix it. 16 Q And given the purpose of the exercise, which 17 is in fact to see if Dr. O'Leary could properly 18 identify positive and negative samples, do you think 19 Dr. Oldstone would have taken extra care to ensure 20 that what he was send ing was in fact what he thought 21 he was sending? 22 A Absolutely. It's also I think quite 23 relevant that the issue of contamination in Dr. 24 Oldstone's laboratory did not come up in the 25 conversation between Dr. O'Leary and Dr. Oldstone Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 148 of 204 960A WARD - DIRECT 1 between the first and the second round of testing. It 2 was only when the O'Leary Lab failed to achieve a 3 reasonable rate of sensitivity and specificity that 4 any concerns were raised about Dr. Oldstone's 5 competence to prepare samples and send them to 6 O'Leary, Dr. O'Leary's laboratory. 7 Q Now Dr. Kennedy also suggested on Tuesday 8 that one of the reasons Dr. O'Leary might have missed 9 some of the positive tests from Dr. Oldstone's lab was 10 because the copy numbers were very low. It was low 11 detectable limits. Does that make sense given what 12 actually happened in the attempt to replicate? 13 A Well, sure. I think, to be a good test, I 14 mean, my daughter is now trying to get into high 15 school. I keep telling her to be a good test, it has 16 to be hard. And so I'm sure that Dr. Oldstone sent 17 Dr. O'Leary some slam -dunk easy samples and some 18 really low copy number samples. I think Dr. Rima 19 pointed out very clearly that a large number of labs 20 around the world would have beaten a path to his door 21 had he really been able to do this in order to 22 initiate collaborations with Dr. O'Leary, because he 23 was claiming to do something that nobody had actually 24 done yet. 25 And so I'm sure that it's plausible that Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 149 of 204 961A WARD - DIRECT 1 some of the low, low positive samples that Dr. 2 Oldstone sent to Dr. O'Leary's lab might be missed 3 becaus e of lack of sensitivity. However, that doesn't 4 explain how a test can be false positive. That's not 5 an issue of sensitivity. That's an issue of 6 specificity. And it certainly doesn't explai n how a 7 false positive can become false negative or a false 8 negative can become false positive. It's impossible 9 that that would occur because a low copy number was 10 there. 11 Q Now did Dr. Oldstone also discuss or comment 12 on the hypothesized link between MMR and ASD? 13 A Yes. He said that he was quite willing to 14 believe that there could be such an association when 15 he entered into this agreement with Dr. O'Leary with 16 funding from the MIND Institute. Dr. Oldstone is a 17 curmudgeon. He's a tough old guy and there's no way 18 that he would waste his time setting up a series of 19 things if he didn't think it was possible that Dr. 20 O'Leary had actually done this. He would have just 21 said no, I'm not going to be involved with this at 22 all. 23 So, by entering into this agreement, he was 24 showing a willingness to believe. It's just that as 25 Dr. Rima said, for a good scientist, it's really not a Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 150 of 204 962A WARD - DIRECT 1 question of belief, it's a question of what you can 2 prove to be true. And in this case, he was willing to 3 believe but only until proof could not be supplied. 4 Q A nd just for the sake of the transcript, did 5 he put all of this into a letter which he then sent to 6 you? 7 A Yes. What happened was I was taking notes 8 as he was talking, and so after our conversation, I 9 asked him if he would be willing to put this into a 10 letter, and he basically said send me your notes. And 11 so I sent him my notes and he wrote the letter and the 12 letter was submitted to the Court. 13 Q Yes. Respondent's Exhibit AA. Now 14 switching gears a little bit, did you read the 15 rebuttal opinions from Dr. Kennedy and Dr. Hepner 16 concerning Unigenetics and PCR? 17 A I did. 18 Q Now Dr. Hepner goes into some detail about 19 the work you did and suggests that SYBR Green is an 20 inadequate tool for comparing results from Taqman PCR 21 testing. Do you agree? 22 A No, not at all. 23 Q Why not? 24 A Well, certainly in terms of the generation 25 of amplicons, that really doesn't depend upon your Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 151 of 204 963A WARD - DIRECT 1 detection system. You can detect PCR results with a 2 wide range of the age nts with probes, as was pointed 3 out last time, or with dyes that intercolate into the 4 DNA. And so really what is amplified in a PCR 5 reaction is driven by the primers. And if the primers 6 amplify something that is picked up either by a probe 7 or by SYBR Green, it still is amplified by the 8 primers. 9 SYBR Green is actually a good first step to 10 determining whether or not your primers are amplifying 11 what you want. And so, in this case, we chose to use 12 the primers and SYBR Green, knowing full well that we 13 were going to take any products that were amplified 14 out to the stage of sequencing to know exactly what we 15 were dealing with. And so we weren't going to rely on 16 a probe to give us the specificity. We were actu ally 17 going to take it all the way to the stage of 18 sequencing. 19 And so the detection system is irrelevant in 20 terms of the major observation, which is that O'Leary 21 or the Uhlmann primers result in the amplification of 22 things that in this case look like a duck, walk like a 23 duck but aren't ducks. They are human genes. 24 So, in the multilayered evaluation of the 25 amplification products, we looked at melt curve Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 152 of 204 964A WARD - DIRECT 1 analysis. We looked at the size of the amplicons 2 produced. And then we did sequencing on the results. 3 And some of the samples yielded things that have the 4 correct melting temperature, had the right size on gel 5 but were nonetheless human gene products as opposed to 6 viral gene products. 7 Q Now on the topic of the primers, Dr. Hepner 8 also suggested the southern blot and Taqman PCR 9 results ensured that the primers from Dr. O'Leary and 10 Dr. Uhlmann were basically doing what they're supposed 11 to do, amplifying measles virus. You suggested, do 12 you agree? 13 A Well, I think that the Uhlmann primers on a 14 positive control specimen can probably amplify the 15 correct sequence and it can be confirmed on a western 16 blot or a southern blot. So it's not the fact that 17 the Uhlmann primers are so bad that they never amplif y 18 measles. It's just that they don't only amplify 19 measles. That's really the distinction. They amplify 20 measles. And so, yes, in this case, there's sort of 21 no contest. They're both true. It's just that Dr. 22 Hepner doesn't acknowledge that the primers amplify 23 more than just measles. 24 Q And can this amplification problem affect 25 data interpretation? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 153 of 204 965A WARD - DIRECT 1 A Well, of course, because if your primers are 2 amplifying, are capable of amplifying both the measles 3 gene, message or measles genes and human genes and 4 human messages, then if you get a product, if you get 5 a signal, you really don't know if it's the human gene 6 that's been amplified or the measles gene that's been 7 amplified. 8 Q Now Dr. Rima testified about this at some 9 length this morning, but because you also have 10 expertise in PCR, I want to give you the opportunity 11 to comment on this point of the rebuttals, what Drs. 12 Kennedy and Hepner are saying that high copy numbers 13 eliminate concerns about contamination assay 14 inefficiency in threshold cycle. Do you agree? Do 15 you care to briefly comment? 16 A Well, I think with the caveat that Dr. Rima 17 has pointed out that in fact we have no idea what the 18 actual copy number that was amplified was. All we 19 know is the end product that's the result of in some 20 cases huge multiplication. The fact that one has a 21 high copy number does not at all rule out that you 22 have contamination. I could show you some students' 23 work in my lab where they have extraordinarily high 24 contamination and therefore have extraordinarily high 25 rates of copy numbers. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 154 of 204 966A WARD - DIRECT 1 So si mply to say we have a high copy number, 2 therefore, there can't be contamination doesn't make 3 any sense at all but it can simply mean that you had 4 gross contamination rather than low -level 5 contamination, although I have to say low -level 6 contamination is much more common, but gross 7 contamination certainly can occur. 8 Q Now Dr. Bradstreet in his report an d his 9 testimony on Monday discussed a number of test results 10 for Colten Snyder, implying that they would be 11 indicative of measles virus persistence. I want to go 12 through a few of them and just see to the extent they 13 haven't been covered by our other experts. What's the 14 significance of an elevated rheumatoid factor? 15 A In isolation, almost nothing. 16 Q What sort of conditions can it be associated 17 with? 18 A A whole range of autoimmune, inflammatory, 19 neoplastic and infectious conditions. Many, many 20 different conditions can give you an elevated 21 rheumatoid factor. It's a fairly nonspecific measure. 22 Q Now does this similar statement apply to the 23 anti -myelin basic protein tites? 24 A Yes, I would think so. In a single result 25 in isolation or pulled from a very thick chart where Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 155 of 204 967 WARD - DIRECT 1 hundreds of tests have been ordered, an isolated 2 result needs to be interpreted in light of that 3 clinical presentation and all of the other results. 4 Q So would this also apply to the serum 5 vitamin A and elevated Ig E? 6 A Absolutely. One of the axioms in clinical 7 medicine, and Dr. Rima sort of deferred a little bit 8 because he has experience with measles but not so much 9 clinical experience, but one of the axioms in clinical 10 medicine is if somebody comes to you with a result, 11 and I'll give you an example, an extremist. 12 If a medical student comes to you with a 13 result like a potassium value of 1, now they're going 14 to come to you in a panic because that is not 15 compatible with life. And you smile because you've 16 been there before a nd you say, did you stop and look 17 at the patient? And the student says, well, yes. 18 Were they breathing? Yes. The lab result is a 19 mistake. It was probably drawn from the arm where 20 somebody was running in an intravenous solution that 21 has no potassium in it. And so, in isolation, any 22 given value is almost, almost, not completely, but 23 almost useless. 24 You also have to realize that all lab values 25 are based on -- normal ranges are based on 95 percent Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 156 of 204 968A WARD - DIRECT 1 confidence intervals. That means that the normal 2 range is determined by the population average value. 3 By definition, that means that 2.5 percent of the 4 values will be abnormally high or abnormally low. 5 And so the statistical argument then becomes 6 if you do 100 test s on any of us in this courtroom 7 right now, statistically, 5 percent of them will be 8 abnormal, half abnormally low, half abnormally high. 9 And this would be if all of us in the room are 10 completely healthy. 11 What seems to have happened with some of 12 these lab results is that Dr. Bradstreet would look at 13 a very big chart with lots of lab results and say, 14 look at that one, look at that one, that's abnormal 15 and then try to figure out a hypothesis that would 16 explain that lab result in the context of the case 17 that he was trying to build. 18 I call that cherry -picking data. So one of 19 the expert witnesses yesterday was asked about the 20 high IgE, and the answer was, well, gos h, you really 21 should pursue parasites. But that doesn't make a 22 whole lot of sense unless there's a clear 23 epidemiologic exposure to parasites. So, if an 24 individual comes f rom a developing world country, has 25 high eosinophilias, high eosinophils and high IgE, it Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 157 of 204 969A WARD - DIRECT 1 would be completely logical to look for parasites. 2 Even if they go to a daycare. They're in 3 daycare. We see kids like this all the time. 4 Daycares are filthy places. If you see a child like 5 that, you would logically look for parasites. But in 6 isolation, without any other explanation, it just 7 doesn't make sense to incorporate that into this 8 larger theory based on a single report. What you 9 should really do is say was there a clinical picture 10 that is logical, coherent and explainable on the basis 11 of normal biology. 12 THE COURT: A parasite like pinworms? 13 THE WITNESS: Absolutely. Eosinophilia and 14 elevated IGE is very rare in pinworm infection. 15 THE COURT: Okay. 16 THE WITNESS: But certainly there are other 17 parasites that are spread in daycares that can cause 18 elevated IgE and eosinophilia. 19 BY MS. BABCOCK: 20 Q I wanted to switch a little bit to Colten 21 Snyder and some specific MMR questions. Is the MMR 22 vaccine known to cause an increase in secondary 23 infections? 24 A No. So far as I'm aware, there's never been 25 any report of clinically relevant immune compromise in Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 158 of 204 970A WARD - DIRECT 1 any way involving that vaccine. 2 Q And are the symptoms Colten presented with 3 between his MMR vaccination and his May 26, 1998, 4 hospitalization consistent with measle s virus 5 infection? 6 A No, not that I can see. 7 Q Now, on direct examination on Monday, Dr. 8 Bradstreet suggested that the small white patchy 9 exudates on April 6, 1999, might have been -- actually 10 that was probably May 6, 1999, I correct myself -- 11 might have been Koplik's spots. Do you agree? 12 A I don't. Remind me how man y days after the 13 MMR that was. Day 14? 14, 13? That seems to be 14 very, very late. I've looked for a lot of Koplik's 15 spots because I've been involved in several outbreaks, 16 including the one in Philadelphia in 1990. And 17 Koplik's spots are part of the prodrome of natural 18 measles, so they occur very early at the time that 19 individual, whether the y be adult or children, have 20 conjunctivitis or red eyes, runny nose. Those 21 individuals have no sore throat. 22 But if you look carefully on the buccal 23 mucosa, under just the right light, you have to be 24 quite careful, occasionally you can see Koplik's spots 25 in the two to three days before the development of the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 159 of 204 971A WARD - DIRECT 1 rash. But it's a very subtle, very transient 2 phenomenon except in children who are severely 3 malnourished. So I've seen them in the developing 4 world as well. And then those Koplik's spots can 5 actually coalesce and res ult in sloughing of the 6 buccal mucosa, sometimes with bleeding. 7 But in recently nourished individuals, they 8 are a very fleeting observation that you have to look 9 hard. And the reason we spend so much time looking is 10 that they're one of the very few things in medicine 11 that are called pathognomonic, which is if you find 12 it, you have the diagnosis. It's a guarantee. 13 There's nothing else that causes Koplik's spots. And 14 so it's one of those things that older staff people 15 like to do, because if you can find it, you can show 16 it to all of your students and say, look at this, this 17 is pathognomonic measles. It doesn't occur in 18 vaccine -strain disease. 19 Q No w backing up to again the symptoms Colten 20 had between April 23 and May 26, the time he was 21 hospitalized, do you think they're consistent with 22 measles encephalitis ADEM or PIEM? 23 A There's no way that you can stretch the 24 observations enough to make them fit even reasonably 25 into any of those diagnostic criteria. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 160 of 204 972 WARD - DIRECT 1 Q Are they consistent with any other condition 2 known to be associated with measles virus? 3 A Not that I'm aware of, no. 4 Q Now you mentioned in your first report that 5 there was evidence that Colten Snyder had a bacterial 6 infection at the time of his May 26, 1998, 7 hospitalization. 8 A Yes. 9 Q What do you rely upon to make that 10 statement? 11 A Well, the fact that he was sick, that he had 12 an exudative pharyngitis and that he had an elevated 13 white count with a marked left shift. 14 Q What does that me an? 15 A Most of the elevation of his white count was 16 attributable to an elevation of his neutrophils, so 17 polymorphonucleocytes. And those are the classic 18 white blood cells that respond to bacterial 19 infections. But he also had a very marked left shift, 20 which is where the neutrophils which are normal in 21 multisegmented cells, the nucleus of the neutrophil 22 typically has four, five, anywhere up to 12 lobes in 23 its nucleus. But those lobes like wrinkles on those 24 of us who are passing 50 accumulate with age of the 25 cell. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 161 of 204 973A WARD - DIRECT 1 And so a young neutrophil doesn't have very 2 many lobes to its nucleus. And a white blood cell 3 that's just released from the bone marrow, it often 4 has no lobes. It's just a single big nucleus. It's 5 just a band for a nucleus. And so those are actually 6 called band neutrophils or bands. 7 And in fact he had a very elevated, what 8 doctors call bandamia. He had an elevate d level of 9 neutrophils with this band form. And that's almost 10 pathognomonic of an active, ongoing bacterial 11 infection. That's again one of those things that when 12 you find it, you bring all of your students and 13 trainees over and say, look at this, remember it, 14 because it can really help you when you're trying to 15 figure out if this is a viral or a bacterial process. 16 Q So is it fair to say that this was a 17 laboratory finding that was consistent with the 18 clinical picture? 19 A Absolutely. 20 Q Is it consistent with a viral infection? 21 A I would say almost, almost impossible. I'm 22 not aware of any viral infection that gives you an 23 elevated band count. Furthermore, this relatively 24 small number of lymphocytes, which are typically 25 elevated in viral infections, when you have an active Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 162 of 204 974 WARD - DIRECT 1 viral infection, many of those lymphocytes are what 2 are called atypical lymphocytes. They are big. They 3 are often angular. 4 Most resting lymphocytes are little round 5 things with dark nuc lei and have very pale blue 6 cytoplasm, using the typical stains. Atypical 7 lymphocytes have a much larger nucleus, a more active 8 looking cytoplasm that tends to be a different shade 9 of blue. And so competent technologists can readily 10 say this is typical and this is an atypical 11 lymphocyte. And a high lymphocyte count with lots of 12 atypical lymphocytes w ould be standard for many acute 13 viral illnesses. And at that time, Colten had 14 relatively few lymphocytes, with only I think two or 15 three percent atypical lymphocytes, so very compatible 16 with a bacterial process, not at all compatible with a 17 viral process. 18 Q And is this left shift that you've just 19 described evidence of a functioning immune system? 20 A Oh, sure. It's the kind of response that 21 you don't see in individuals who have just had a bone 22 marrow transplant or who are immunocompromised because 23 of chemotherapy. That's precisely the response that 24 they can't make. 25 Q So overall, based on your own medical Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 163 of 204 975 WARD - DIRECT 1 experience and practice, review of the medical 2 records, expert rep orts, listening to testimony in 3 this case, do you place any reliance on the 4 Unigenetics results for Colten Snyder? 5 A No. I have no confidence whatsoever in the 6 results. 7 Q Do you think there's any evidence to show 8 that the MMR vaccine more probably than not caused 9 Colten Snyder's ASD? 10 A No, I do not. 11 Q Do you think the MMR part of this hypothesis 12 is biologically plausible? 13 A At some point in time, it may have been 14 biologically plausible. Hypotheses have lives. And I 15 think that this was a hypothesis that had someone as 16 prominent as Michael Oldstone willing to consider it 17 at one point. We embarked o n our own study, in part 18 because we were interested to know if there was any 19 truth to this hypothesis. But it stops being credible 20 after a certain point as evidence builds up against 21 the hypothesis. 22 I mean, there are many hypotheses that 23 people consider to be too weird to be true. The one 24 that comes to mind immediately is Stanley Prusiner's 25 insistence that prions existed, and he was roundly Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 164 of 204 976 WARD - DIRECT 1 criticized for a number of years because nobody 2 believed his data. His hypothesis at that point was 3 just that, it was a hypothesis. But over time, he 4 stuck with it. He convinced other competent 5 scientists to work with him, and he demonstrated in 6 fact that prions were an entirely new biology. And he 7 I think quite rightly won a Nobel Prize not only for 8 his science but for his stubbornness. 9 I think in this case, so biologically 10 plausible? Yes, the hypothesis wa s biologically 11 plausible at some point in some ways. But no longer, 12 because the evidence that has accumulated in the time 13 since the introduction of the hypothesis is just 14 overwhelmingly against it. It was a hypothesis that 15 was biologically plausible but is no longer. It no 16 longer deserves that recognition. 17 Q Any you hold these opinions to a reasonable 18 degree of medical certainty? 19 A Absolutely. 20 MS. BABCOCK: I have no further questions. 21 THE COURT: Mr. Powers, do you want to 22 recess or do you want to launch? 23 MR. POWERS: We're going to go ahead and do 24 the recess. I don't think that we'll go long enough 25 for me to take another recess lat er, so we should do Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 165 of 204 977 WARD - CROSS 1 it no w. 2 THE COURT: All right.

POWERS: Thank you, Special Master. 11 CROSS -EXAMINATION 12 BY MR. POWERS: 13 Q Good afternoon, Dr. Wa rd. 14 A Good afternoon. 15 Q I wanted to ask you a few questions 16 primarily about the direct testimony that you gave 17 here related to a couple of issues that came up in 18 your most recent of a series of expert reports that 19 you filed in this case. In the latest iteration of 20 the expert report, I believe you use a term, 21 \"neurovirulence,\" in describing why the Petitioners 22 can't make out their case. That is, there is no 23 evidence that the measles attenuated strength in 24 neurovirulence. Do you remember using that 25 terminology? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 166 of 204 978A WARD - CROSS 1 A Not really. 2 Q I believe the symptoms -- 3 A I don't remember that specific word in that 4 specific instance. 5 Q Well, I just wanted to raise the issue 6 because my understanding of the whole idea of an 7 attenuated virus is to make it less virulent, that is, 8 to reduce its virule nce so that it can still invoke an 9 immune response but not kill or enter the host, is 10 that right? 11 A Sure, that's the whole idea. 12 Q And so that's the whole i dea of it. And as 13 you work through that process of altenuating a wild 14 virus, it's a multistep process, going through various 15 cell passages, isn't that correct? 16 A Y es, that's right. 17 Q And if I recall Dr. Rima's testimony, he 18 said that as you work through that attenuation 19 process, what happens with the virus is a series of 20 mutations at each step of the way, is that correct? 21 A We presume that to be the mechanism of 22 attenuation, yep. 23 Q And what does it mean when you say you 24 presume that to be as opposed to simply saying yes, 25 that's the mechanism of attenuation? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 167 of 204 979A WARD - CROSS 1 A Well, Dr. Rima also pointed out that even 2 though he knows there are lots of mutations, we don't 3 know wh ich ones of those mutations have resulted in a 4 change in biological character of the virus. So there 5 are many things that are different about vaccine 6 strain and the wild -type virus. 7 Q And certainly there are many things that are 8 different about them. It's just that the underlying, 9 the mechanism, the underlying series of mutations, the 10 details o f how that results in attenuated virus is a 11 mystery to this day from what I've heard? 12 A In my lectures, I call it a black box virus. 13 We put a wild -type virus in, we package it a bunch of 14 times and quite amazingly we take it out at certain 15 points and give it to our children. And it worked. 16 Q And t he fact that it's a black box and that 17 the process and the model inside that box is opaque 18 and nontransparent, you still have an end product and 19 you are confident in the end product even though you 20 didn't know exactly what happened inside that box and 21 when I say confident I mean you know what the end 22 product is. 23 A Right. I think where we have more than 40 24 years of experience with this particular family of 25 vaccines so that we have great competence now, I think Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 168 of 204 980A WARD - CROSS 1 that the first few kids they gave it to, the people 2 were probably pretty nervous. 3 Q And in describing the attenuation as a black 4 box, that implies that there are other mutations and 5 other changes going on there that (a) you don't know 6 that they're happening and (b) might not be able to 7 explain the significance or the consequence of, 8 correct? 9 A I think with any living thing, you can't 10 predict what's going to happen. You can do your best 11 to minimize the change from a certain viral strain, 12 but absolutely you don't know what's going to happen. 13 Q You 've also said in your report and in your 14 testimony that the measles virus is known to cause -- 15 the neurological injuries caused by measles virus are 16 limited I think to two, the SSPE and the MIB E, is that 17 correct? 18 A Those are the two principal known 19 manifestations of wild -type disease. 20 Q And when you say \"principal known 21 manifestations,\" are there other known manifestations 22 that you would add to the mix of those two? 23 A There is the presumed autoimmune process 24 called postinfectious en cephalomyelitis or ADEM. So, 25 in fact, we know a great deal about the neurologic Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 169 of 204 981A WARD - CROSS 1 complications of wild -type measles. That's why it's 2 so implausible in some ways that suddenly there would 3 be something so different as what's being proposed 4 here. 5 Q Is there anything about the properties or 6 the structure of the measles virus that would make it 7 impossible for it to cause any outcomes other than the 8 ones that you've already described? 9 A Of course not. There's nothing that would 10 make it impossible. 11 Q So there's not anything about its structure, 12 its replication, its life cycle that would 13 biologically rule out something like the injuries that 14 are claimed here? 15 A Something like the injuries? So you're 16 asking me is it in the realm of -- I think Dr. Rima 17 has also reacted by saying you can't prove a negative. 18 There's no way that anybody could credibly answer it 19 can never happen. The fact is there's no evidence 20 that it does happen. 21 Q Now you discuss in your direct, I would sa y 22 it's seen in the report, I think I heard it on direct 23 for the first time, that wild -type measles virus can 24 actually cure some autoimmune diseases. 25 A Yes. There a re a couple of case reports Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 170 of 204 982A WARD - CROSS 1 where that appears to have occurred, either a cure or 2 for a period of time made better. 3 Q When was that discovered? You're relying on 4 case reports. Where were the case reports? 5 A This is the literature from the late '60s 6 and early '70s where individuals with different 7 conditions like idiopathic thrombacytopenic purpura 8 where you have an immune disruption of your platelets 9 or a couple of kids with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis 10 would get quite remarkably better right around the 11 time that the y had the natural measles. 12 And the presumption has always been that the 13 virus would target actively replicating cells and that 14 might actually delete enough of them or kill enough of 15 them that these T -cell autoimmune -mediated processes 16 might actually be resolved following measles, although 17 I'm not sure that anybody would recommend measles 18 therapy if you had JRA or any of these other 19 conditions. 20 Q So, at the time that it became discovered 21 that this was in fact a result of wild measles virus 22 expos ure, at that point, it was new and it was pretty 23 novel? 24 A Pretty new and pretty novel? Yes, it was 25 novel enough to be interesting and be published, yes. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 171 of 204 983A WARD - CROSS 1 Q Now you spent a significant amount of time 2 in your testimony discussing conversations that -- 3 well, I don't know if it was a conversation or 4 multiple conversations. 5 A Single conversations. 6 Q Single conversation with Dr. Oldstone. And 7 in that conversation -- 8 A Lots of conversations with his secretary. 9 Q In order to get the one conversation with 10 Dr. Oldstone, okay. 11 A That's right. 12 Q Now Dr. Oldstone has not appeared as far as 13 you know in any case in the vaccine program or in the 14 civil system involving the debate about MMR and 15 autism, is that correct? 16 A I didn't ask him that, so I don't know. 17 Q That's all right. Just based on as far as 18 you know. 19 A As far as I know, I don't know, yes. 20 Q And he did not appear, for example, to 21 testify in Cedillo, nor did he submit an expert report 22 in the Cedillo matter? 23 A That's correct. 24 Q Didn't appear or submit an expert report in 25 this matter? Heritage Reporting Corpor ation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 172 of 204 984A WARD - CROSS 1 A That's correct. 2 Q And in the letter where he does make a note 3 that he sees no evidence to support a link between 4 measles virus and autism, we don't have any record of 5 what he was re ading or reviewing or relied on to make 6 that statement. We don't have any indication of that 7 here in front of the Court or on the record, do we? 8 A I certainly don't. 9 Q So all we know is what his conclusion is 10 based on a telephone conversation with you but not 11 really knowing what the basis in fact and in the 12 evidence of that opinion was, correct? 13 A Well, no. I think as I say, I don't know 14 Dr. Oldstone, but I think that this is an area of 15 enormous interest to Dr. Oldstone. If this hypothesis 16 that's being forward is true, it would be of enormous 17 interest scientifically to Dr. Oldstone. And I think 18 that the fact that Dr. Oldstone has not referenced, 19 has not cited any of the publications that have been 20 produced in support of this hypothesis in any of his 21 writings in the last two decades suggests that it's 22 not that he's not aware of the hypothesis, it's that 23 he is voting with his pen to understand he actually 24 voted against the hypothesis. He doesn't believe it. 25 // Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 173 of 204 985 WARD - CROSS 1 Q So I understand that. That's been expressed 2 in the letter, so I'm not asking you to speculate on 3 what he might have been thinking or what his motives 4 are. I'm just trying to determine is there anything 5 that you're aware of in notes, in material that you 6 might have exchanged after the phone call, anything 7 that you can point to that tells us what he relied on 8 in order to come to the conclusion that is expressed 9 in this letter? 10 A Only the facts that he related to me in the 11 telephone conversation. 12 Q Okay. That's all I was trying to get to. 13 Now the letter itself talks about what sounds like 14 some conclusions or a summary that Dr. Oldstone is 15 making of a process of back -and-forth that went on for 16 a fair amount of time between hi mself and Dr. O'Leary 17 and the staff at Dr. O'Leary's lab. Is that a fair 18 statement? 19 A I don't know the exact period of time. I 20 don't know the exact period of time , but I would 21 assume it would be over a period of at least a year. 22 Q Okay. And what we have here summarizes a 23 period of at least a year's back and forth with sort 24 of the headline numbers, the headline numbers being 25 the 20 percent samples in two rounds of testing that Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 174 of 204 986 WARD - CROSS 1 were allegedly misidentified. We don't have in front 2 of us and I'm curious as to whether you have access to 3 it or have seen it, any documentation from Dr. 4 Oldstone's lab describing the methods and the 5 procedures that were used to generate the samples that 6 he sent to Dr. O'Leary? Do you have any of that? 7 A I have none of that. 8 Q Have you reviewed any of that? 9 A No. 10 Q Do you know of anybody who has reviewed that 11 material aside from apparently Dr. Oldstone in making 12 the presentation in this letter? 13 A I think that if Dr. Oldstone had been 14 allowed to publish the data, then the entire world 15 could have reviewed the methods and the data. 16 Q But we don't know, so we don't know what he 17 was doing about contamination in his laboratory, do 18 we? 19 A No, we do not, but that reasonably would 20 have been contained in any publication that he was 21 allowed to produce. 22 Q Yes. So I'm not asking about what 23 presumably might have happened. I'm asking about what 24 we know now today based on a letter that now today is 25 in front of the Special Master. I'm just trying to Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 175 of 204 987 WARD - CROSS 1 focus on that and not spec ulate about what might be 2 out there. So we do not know today what methodology 3 was used to generate the samples in Dr. Oldstone's 4 lab? 5 A No, we do not. 6 Q We don't know what controls were there to 7 make sure that he had confidence before they left the 8 door that the samples that were labeled positive were 9 in fact positive and the samples labeled negative were 10 in fact negative. We don't have any information that 11 would illuminate that, do we? 12 A We do not. 13 Q We don't have any information to illuminate 14 it on either the first round of the sample exchange or 15 the second round, correct? 16 A That's correct. 17 Q We don't have any information about how Dr. 18 Oldstone might or might not have handled contamination 19 at his lab, do we? 20 A You asked me that before. No, we do not. 21 Q And we do know that that lab handled a fair 22 amount of measles virus. That was a central focus of 23 his investigations, correct? 24 A Yes. 25 Q Now was your testimony that the possibility Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 176 of 204 988 WARD - CROSS 1 that Dr. Oldstone's samples might have been 2 contaminated, was it your testimony that that didn't 3 come up until after the second round of samples we re 4 exchanged? 5 A I'm responding simply to Dr. Kennedy's 6 testimony where he raised the possibility that the 7 contamination may have been in Dr. Oldstone's 8 laboratory. If in fact there had been a concern by 9 the O'Leary Lab about contamination from Dr. 10 Oldstone's laboratory, it seems logical to me that Dr. 11 O'Leary would not have continued the collaboration 12 because he would not have had confidence in Dr. 13 Oldstone's laboratory. 14 By entering into the second round of 15 testing, I think that it is a prett y reasonable 16 assumption that at that time, Dr. O'Leary believed Dr. 17 Oldstone's lab to be free of contamination. It would 18 have been scientifically very foolish for him to 19 c ontinue to work with what he believed might have been 20 contaminated specimens. 21 Q Or it might have been reasonable since they 22 were looking forward to working in a collaborative 23 nature to see if at both ends there might ne 24 contamination, and perhaps together they could resolve 25 the contamination issue if in fact that was the issue. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 177 of 204 989A WARD - CROSS 1 That seems like a reasonab le conclusion to reach about 2 people collaborating. 3 A In a situation where your laboratory is 4 being tested, all of us who run reference labs deal 5 with this all the t ime. We get test samples sent from 6 outside. It's a requirement in the U.S. and Canada to 7 have your lab undergo external evaluation to see how 8 well you're doing. Even though we try to blind those 9 specimens as best as we can, when those specimens come 10 in, the technologists know what they are and they do 11 their very, very best to make sure that those samples 12 are treated in the very, very best way possible. 13 I think it's a reasonable assumption that 14 Dr. O'Leary's laboratory was on high alert when 15 receiving specimens from Dr. Oldstone, and they still 16 couldn't do it right. 17 Q And we still don't know because we don't 18 have the data in front of us whether Dr. Oldstone's 19 lab did it right either? 20 A Your own experts appear to hold Dr. Oldstone 21 in fairly high regard, as do I. I think his 22 reputation is pretty good. 23 Q I understand that, and this is not to impugn 24 his reputation. All I'm saying is that I think it was 25 Dr. Rima on the stand who said particularly when it Heritage Reporting C orporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 178 of 204 990A WARD - CROSS 1 comes to headline numbers, his instinct is to distrust 2 or to disbelieve the things that land on his desk, and 3 this is what's landed on the desk here. I'm just 4 raising the issue that we don't know because we don't 5 have evidence, and we can't go beyo nd that lack of 6 evidence. 7 A If Dr. Oldstone had been allowed to publish 8 the data, we would have that evidence. 9 Q Or perhaps if Dr. Oldstone was here to 10 testify and was willing to bring materials here with 11 him to support his testimony, that might provide an 12 answer. But that hasn't happened at this point, has 13 it? 14 A Perhaps petitioning the MIND Institute to 15 permit him to publish the data would be a 16 scientifically valid way of getting this into the 17 public domain. 18 Q Or again, you've made that point a couple of 19 times. Just without being contentious, I want to make 20 sure that you understood the question and get an 21 answer to the specific question. The question is the 22 debate about the facts in this process between Dr. 23 Oldstone and Dr. O'Leary could be illuminated if Dr. 24 Oldstone was here to testify about it and provide the 25 Special Masters and the parties with the underlying Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 179 of 204 991 WARD - CROSS 1 information, isn't that correct? 2 A I believe that either Dr. O'Leary or Dr. 3 Oldstone would be able to provide the Court with that 4 informat ion. 5 Q Now you mentioned again towards the end of 6 your testimony a couple of issues that you were 7 raising with Dr. Bradstreet and the tests that he did 8 and the possibility that parasites might be involved 9 came out. I know that the Special Master had a 10 comment about parasites, and I think it was based on 11 things that you wer e saying that the immune labworks 12 indicated there might be parasites that were involved 13 here. Do you remember that back -and-forth? 14 A Sure. 15 Q Did you review Colten Snyder's medical 16 records before you testified today? 17 A Yes, I did. 18 Q In reviewing those records, do you recall 19 that on his admission to the hospital , he was tested 20 for parasites and came up negative? 21 A Yes. 22 Q Okay. 23 A I also run a reference lab for parasitology 24 and I know the limits of those tests. 25 Q I understand that, but I don't want to get Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 180 of 204 992 WARD - CROSS 1 in a collateral debate about the quality of the lab 2 work at the Ormond Beach Hospital. 3 A That's fin e. 4 Q All I want to do is say, you understand that 5 he was tested at a hospital, no parasites? 6 A By a stool examination, and they found no 7 parasites in the stool examination. 8 Q You also mentioned in talking about Dr. 9 Bradstreet that he was cherry -picking data to support 10 the case he was trying to build. Do you recall making 11 that statement on direct testimony? 12 A Yes, I do. 13 Q Is it your understanding that he was 14 reviewin g data to provide what he believed was 15 reasonable medical care for a very sick child? 16 A I have to believe that Dr. Bradstreet was 17 acting in good faith for a patient. 18 Q To provide clinical care and medical 19 treatment he felt was indicated for that child, 20 correct? 21 A It's my understanding that the clinical care 22 of this child was Dr. Bradstreet's responsibility, 23 yes. 24 MR.

POWERS: 8 Q Obviously, you have already testified on 9 direct and have been cross -examined in this matter. 10 You've been called in rebuttal because there are some 11 specific issues that arise in the expert report and in 12 the direct testimony of Respondent's expert, Dr. Rima. 13 Is that your understan ding? 14 A That's correct. 15 Q And you're taking the stand here so we can 16 briefly deal with a handful of issues that you want to 17 talk on rebuttal for in terms of statements of fact 18 and discussions of your relevant experience to testify 19 in this matter, is that correct? 20 A That's correct. 21 Q So the first matter is if we can look 22 initially to Dr. Rima's expert report itself, and this 23 is Respondent's Exhibit V. And the first place I'd 24 like to draw folks' atte ntion to is on page 4 of 25 Exhibit V. I see people turning pages, so I will Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 185 of 204 996 KENNEDY - DIRECT ( REBUTTAL ) 1 pause and let folks get to where they need to be. 2 THE COURT: Okay. 3 BY MR. POWERS: 4 Q So, Dr. Kennedy, do you have that opened to 5 page 4? 6 A Yes, I do. 7 Q If you look down at the second to last full 8 paragraph on th at page, there's a paragraph that 9 begins \"On page 6.\" Do you see where I'm referring 10 to? 11 A Yes. 12 Q And in Dr. Rima's report, he describes that 13 you expressed the relationship between two different 14 measles strains, the Schwarz and the Moraten, as being 15 closely related. Do you see that reference? 16 A Correct. 17 Q He then says that they are actually 18 genetically identical. Do you see that? 19 A Correct. 20 Q When you read that under the heading 21 \"Discussion of Dr. Kennedy's relevant experience,\" 22 what significance did you attach to that mention of 23 the two different measles strains by Dr. Rima? 24 A Well, I thought that perhaps it was unclear 25 on how that was cited in my expert report and there Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 186 of 204 997 KENNEDY - DIRECT ( REBUTTAL ) 1 was some confusion relative to where the statement 2 came from. 3 Q Where in fact di d the statement come from? 4 Is this something that you just came up with on your 5 own? 6 A No. This statement is from the Virology, 7 Fields, a chapter by Dr. Diane Gri ffin. It's chapter 8 44. And if you look on page 127 -- 9 Q Or would that be -- 10 A 1427, I'm sorry. 1427, and I apologize, I 11 highlighted stuff in pink and you r copies are coming 12 out dark. But if you see, there's a comment on page 13 1427 under \"attenuated live virus vaccines,\" that 14 section, and if you see a No. 1 -- 15 THE COURT: Yes. 16 THE WITNESS: -- near the bottom of the 17 page, it says, and I quote, \"The Moraten strain used 18 in the United States was licensed in 1968 a nd is 19 closely related to Schwarz.\" 20 BY MR. POWERS: 21 Q Was that the source of the comment in your 22 own expert report that Dr. Rima then takes issue with 23 here? 24 A Yes. 25 Q Another issue that we want to address on Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 187 of 204 998A KENNEDY - DIRECT ( REBUTTAL ) 1 rebuttal is if we go back to Exhibit V, which is Dr. 2 Rima's report, and turn to page 2, and at page 2 in 3 the last full paragraph, there's a discussion of a 4 subject that also came up on direct testimony about 5 the high titer measles virus vaccine work that was 6 done. And if you cont inue over to page 3, Dr. Rima 7 made some statements about that study and about your 8 comments on that study. Can you describe that, 9 please? 10 A Yes. Dr. Rima was conc erned about some 11 confusion and it was in light of a statement that I 12 made on page 8, paragraph three of my report, which 13 was not clear. And I would like to essentially cite 14 where the clarification came as it relates to the high 15 titer measles vaccine and whether or not 16 immunosuppression did occur. 17 Q And where would you direct the Special 18 Master's attention? 19 A On page 1428, the first column, lines 9 to 20 14, and it should be label number 2, and I'll go ahead 21 and just read that paragraph. \"The pathoge nisis\" -- 22 THE COURT: Please don't read it to me. 23 THE WITNESS: Okay. 24 THE COURT: I can read it. 25 THE WITNESS: Got it. Okay. So an yway, I Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 188 of 204 999A KENNEDY - DIRECT ( REBUTTAL ) 1 use that to support my claim. 2 BY MR. POWERS: 3 Q And the claim specifically is a claim that 4 Dr. Rima describes as representing an improper 5 analysis of the literature? 6 A Correct. 7 Q Okay. And then what we want to address is 8 back on page 4 of Dr. Rima's report, which again is 9 Respondent's Exhibit V, the second full paragraph. 10 This is a paragraph that he makes comments about your 11 description of the immunosuppression and 12 immunodeficiency being contraindications for the MMR. 13 I take it that in rebuttal, you take issue with Dr. 14 Rima's statements there? 15 A Yes. The source of that statem ent you can 16 find on page 3 of my expert report in the second 17 paragraph, the first and second line. And I cite the 18 Physicians Desk Reference, Volume 51, in support of 19 that statement. And that was also cited and should 20 have been provided as an exhibit in the Cedillo case. 21 And I was specifically referring to the Merck MMR 22 vaccine product. And if you look under 23 contraindications, immunosuppression and 24 immunodeficiency are contraindicated as stated in the 25 Physicians Desk Reference. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 189 of 204 1000 KENNEDY - DIRECT ( REBUTTAL ) 1 Q And is it your understanding that the PDR 2 both in its authority and its literal weight is the 3 Bible that guides medical care providers in the use of 4 biological products? 5 A Yes, it's my understanding. 6 Q And that any language describing 7 contraindications for any product would be PDR's 8 language that was submitted to and approved by the 9 U.S. Food and Drug Administration? 10 A Correct. 11 Q Anything else on this point that you wanted 12 to address? 13 A I think I understand Dr. Rima's area of 14 confusion, becaus e the MMR vaccine is recommended for 15 HIV -1 seropositive children, and he cites that in his 16 expert report. But there are some caveats to that, 17 and you can find one of the caveats that's mention ed 18 by Dr. Griffin in her textbook. If we want to go 19 there, that is specifically on page 1427, second 20 column, second paragraph, lines 3 to 6, and it starts 21 with \"Progressive fatal.\" 22 Q And it's that statement by Dr. Griffin that 23 you believe lends support to the statement that you 24 made in your own expert report? 25 A In addition to the citation of the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 190 of 204 1001A KENNEDY - DIRECT ( REBUTTAL ) 1 Physicians Desk Reference. And then also below that, 2 she states that it is not recommended for vaccination 3 in children with low CD -4 T-cell counts. 4 THE COURT: For the clinically or the 5 serologically immunosuppressed children? 6 THE WITNESS: Correct. So I just wanted to 7 clarify that point. I understand whe re the confusion 8 came in, and I apologize to Dr. Rima for that. 9 BY MR. POWERS: 10 Q All right. The next point to talk about 11 again is in Respondent's Exhibit V, Dr. Rima's report, 12 still on page 4. This is an issue that also did come 13 up on direct testimony by Dr. Rima today I believe. 14 If you brin g your attention to the third full 15 paragraph down on page 4 of Dr. Rima's report, that's 16 the paragraph that discusses Dr. Kennedy's reference 17 to the measles virus receptor as being a molecule 18 called CD -46. Dr. Kennedy, do you see what I'm 19 referring to here? 20 A Yes. 21 Q And you recall that issue was mentioned 22 briefly in Dr. Rima' s direct testimony? 23 A Yes. 24 Q Something that you were cross -examined about 25 also? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 191 of 204 1002 KENNEDY - DIRECT ( REBUTTAL ) 1 A Yes. 2 Q Why do you take issue with particularly the 3 direct testimony of Dr. Rima? 4 A Well, I agree with Dr. Rima, that CD -150 is 5 indeed a receptor for measles virus . In fact, in my 6 single publication on measles virus, it's clearly 7 stated that CD -150 or SLAM is a receptor for measles 8 virus. The point in my expert testimony for the 9 Snyder case was that I got pretty beat up with the 10 Cedillo Court from the standpoint of mixing wild -type 11 measles virus versus vaccine measles virus, and C -46 12 preferentially is recognized by tissue culture adapted 13 in vaccine strain measles virus whereas CD -150 is 14 primarily for wild -type. So I again apologize. That 15 was an omission on my part, and I do cite my single 16 publication. But CD -150 is the primary receptor. 17 Q So just to clarify that, by talking about 18 CD -46, in no way did you mean to even imply that CD - 19 150 or the SLAM w asn't the appropriate preferred 20 receptor? 21 A That's correct. 22 Q And then one last point. I don't think it's 23 in Dr. Rima's expert report, but it did come up during 24 his direct testimony today. I should mention you were 25 here for his direct testimony, is that correct? Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 192 of 204 1003 KENNEDY - DIRECT ( REBUTTAL ) 1 A Yes. 2 Q In his direct testimony, do you recall he 3 men tioned an issue about the R protein in measles 4 virus? 5 A Correct. 6 Q What is your recollection of his testimony? 7 A That he was not aware that an R protein had 8 been identified. 9 Q And what is your response to that in 10 rebuttal? 11 A If you turn to the Gr iffin chapter on page 12 1404 and if you look at the schematic, Figure 4, 13 you'll see that the P gene is divided into P, V, C and 14 R such that the P gene product is a multicistronic 15 gene which encodes those four proteins. Then if you 16 go to the next page, 1405, schematic Figure 6 again 17 talks about P, C, V and R proteins. And then if you 18 go to the secon d column, lines 9 to 12, and I believe 19 I have those bracketed, it describes the fourth 20 protein from the P gene product, the R protein, that 21 it is a ribosomal frameshifting product. 22 Q So based on what you see here and the text 23 that you refer to both in the tables and the narrative 24 chapter underneath that, what is your opinion about 25 the existence of the R gene in measles virus?

POWERS: I have no further questions, 4 Special Master. 5 THE COURT: Okay. Cross -examination? Do 6 you need a minute? 7 MS. BABCOCK: No. 8 THE COURT: Okay. 9 (Pause.) 10 THE WITNESS: Glad I highlighted all my 11 evidence just to help you out. 12 MS. BABCOCK: Just a few. 13 THE COURT: Go ahead. 14 CROSS-EXAMINATION 15 BY MS. BABCOCK: 16 Q Is there a more recent edition of Fields' 17 Virology? 18 A Yes, there is several more recent edition s. 19 Q Okay. And there's also a 2006 edition? 20 A There's actually one that just came out. I 21 thought it was 2007, but I think they're up to Volume 22 7. 23 Q And let me just clarify, Diane Griffin wrote 24 all of these chapters? 25 A Yes.

And my inference was 11 that it may be related. 12 Q Okay. Now you were talking about the PDR. 13 Actually, I apologize. I have the current edition of 14 the PDR for MMR, and I believe the language the 15 language is the same because I looked at the 51st 16 edition as well. On the issue of HIV, and I know this 17 is just a very small point here, b ut I'm just going to 18 read the outline because we don't have it filed. 19 \"Primary and acquired immonodeficiency 20 states, including patients who are immunosuppressed in 21 association with AIDS there are other clinical 22 manifestations of infection with human 23 immunodeficiency viruses.\" So, by this, they mean 24 it's contraindicated for patients th at have some 25 // Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 195 of 204 1006A KENNEDY - CROSS ( REBU TTAL ) 1 pretty clear symptoms? 2 A Correct. 3 Q Or full -blown AIDS? 4 A Correct. 5 MS. BABCOCK: Nothing further. 6 THE COURT: Okay. Anything else? 7 (No response.) 8 THE COURT: I have no questions. I think I 9 understood all the testimony at this time. Thank you 10 much, Dr. Kennedy. You may return to your seat. 11 (Witness excused.) 12 MR. MATANOSKI: Ma'am, if we may have five 13 minutes to determine if there's going to be any 14 surrebuttal? 15 THE COURT: Certainly. 16 MR. MATANOSKI: Thank you. 17 THE COURT: We're in recess. 18 (Whereupon, a short recess was taken.) 19 THE COURT: One moment. I'm just trying to 20 make sure we're recording. Okay, we are. We're back 21 on the record then in the Snyder case. Ms. Babcock? 22 MS. BABCOCK: Respondent calls Dr. Rima for 23 very brief surrebuttal. 24 THE COURT: Okay. Dr. Rima, if you'll 25 resume your seat on the witness stand. And I remind Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 196 of 204 1007A RIMA - DIRECT (CONT'D) (REBUTTAL) 1 you that you are still under oath. 2 Whereupon, 3 BERTUS KAREL RIMA, PhD 4 having been previously duly sworn, was 5 recalled as a witness herein and was examined and 6 testified further as follows: 7 THE COURT: Ms. Babcock, you may p roceed. 8 DIRECT EXAMINATION 9 BY MS. BABCOCK: 10 Q Dr. Rima, you were sitting in the room when 11 Dr. Kennedy came up to clarify a few points? 12 A I did. 13 Q What's your response? 14 A Well, there's a number of points that he 15 raised, and on a number of points, he obviously 16 indic ated that he was sorry for creating some 17 confusion and I appreciate that. 18 In terms of the more substantial points that 19 he made, there is a difficulty with the R protein in 20 the sense that nobody has ever demonstrated it. It 21 was based on a single publication by Darryl Briedis a 22 long time ago. It has never been quoted. It has 23 never been shown. And essentially it is in the 24 textbooks, yes, but as far as people who are working 25 in the field are concerned, it is of no particular Heritage Repo rting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 197 of 204 1008A RIMA - DIRECT (CONT'D) (REBUTTAL) 1 discussion point anymore because there is no evid ence 2 that it exists. And so, in that sense, that's a 3 statement that I make in relation to that point. 4 In terms of the receptors, in terms of the 5 Schwarz and Moraten vaccine, in the 2001 edition of 6 Diane, she might have written that and it was clearly 7 there. But in the field, we know there are papers by 8 Chris Parcks at the time which actually provi de -- 9 Q Can you spell the last name? 10 A Parcks, P -A-R-C-K-S, in the Journal of 11 Virology, and I unfortunately haven't got the 12 reference at hand, which shows v ery clearly that two 13 strains are genetically identical and cannot be 14 separated and hence was my point. 15 So what it demonstrates is this, that 16 there's obviously a n umber of statements taken out of 17 this version of Diane Griffin's chapter in Fields' 18 Virology, but in the field, we discount the R protein 19 completely because no evidence has ever been produced 20 for its existence. And a mechanism of frameshifting 21 is actually one which is difficult to rhyme with the 22 further information that we have about the various 23 proteins that ar e generated. 24 And secondly, as I said, the Parcks paper 25 shows the point that I was making. In terms of the Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 198 of 204 1009A RIMA - DIRECT (CONT'D) (REBUTTAL) 1 receptors, my main reaction in Dr. Kennedy's direct 2 evidence was that we call it a primary receptor for 3 measles. SLAM is the receptor that is actually 4 preferred both by the vaccine strain and by the wild - 5 type strains, and that is something that it is not 6 easy to make a complete and utter determination of 7 which of the two receptors is the most preferred one. 8 But certainly the vaccine strain can use SLAM as well 9 as CD -46. 10 And I refer back to my direct testimony this 11 morning where I said that even in the case of this 12 child that we are s tudying at the moment, and this is 13 unpublished and therefore, you could say that -- and 14 certainly it would be difficult for Dr. Kennedy to 15 know about that. But even in the case of the child 16 that has the Schwarz vaccine and was immunocomprised, 17 had -- we see that virus in that particular child. 18 Even though there's a vaccine strain which can use CD - 19 46, it still goes to cells which express SLAM and not 20 CD -46. 21 So that is where I took issue with the 22 particular thing that may well appear in the textbook, 23 but the folks in th e field know that this no longer 24 current knowledge. 25 Q So is it fair to say that the statements you Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628-4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 199 of 204 1010A RIMA - DIRECT (CONT'D) (REBUTTAL) 1 made in your report were based on your own experience, 2 knowledge and expertise in specifically studying the 3 measles virus? 4 A That's right. 5 MS. BABCOCK: I have nothing further. 6 TH E COURT: Cross? 7 MR. POWERS: Nothing further. 8 THE COURT: And I just have one followup 9 question and that is, as you talked about the Parck 10 paper and so meone from Live Labs, that involves 11 actually sequencing both strains? 12 THE WITNESS: That sequenced the whole. 13 That sequenced the Schwarz and Moraten, the wild -type 14 strain that we have, a reference which isn't the 15 complete wild type because it had already been passed 16 eight times in the original Edmonston as it's called. 17 He also sequenc ed the Edmonston and I think one other 18 vaccine strain. 19 THE COURT: Okay. Questions based on mine? 20 MR. POWERS: No, Special Master. 21 THE COURT: All right. Then it would appear 22 we can recess until 9:00 tomorrow morning. But do we 23 need to do something else in the record? 24 MR. WICKERSHAM: If I might? 25 THE COURT: Go ahead. Certainly, Mr. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 200 of 204 1011A RIMA - DIRECT (CONT'D) (REBUTTAL) 1 Wickersham. 2 MR. WICKERSHAM: May it please the Special 3 Master. I took to heart your comment earlier about 4 the U.K. and the reports from the U.K. and the need to 5 obtain those. Admittedly I'm here representing the 6 Snyders and we're the last in the series and to some 7 degree the new kids on t he block if you'll excuse the 8 expression. 9 I'm very concerned about obtaining those 10 reports. The experts in our case are perfectly 11 willing to waive any confidenti alities, but that 12 doesn't create standing in a British court for the 13 other issues. What I'm interested in is the standing 14 issue that I will need to have access to a British 15 court to have a judge there reconsider either his 16 order or another judge to overturn his order. And in 17 that regard, I would like to ask this Court to issue a 18 subpoena that I then can domesticate in the U.K. and 19 then I would have standing to attack that order. We 20 don't have standing -- 21 THE COURT: Mr. Wickersham, I understand. 22 Ther e are very specific procedures for subpoenaing 23 things from foreign jurisdictions that involve the 24 Hague Convention. 25 MR. WICKERSHAM: Correct. Heritage Reporting Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 201 of 204 1012A RIMA - DIRECT (CONT'D) (REBUTTAL) 1 THE COURT: And we'll have to delve into 2 that more. But ordinarily we don't use a subpoena to 3 get them, get things that are under seal in particular 4 from a foreign court. 5 MR. WICKERSHAM: I'm just concerned about 6 the standing issue and with the briefing times that I 7 know that you're very interested in turning out a fair 8 opinion as soon and a s expeditiously as possible, and 9 I don't want to leave any stone unturned that's going 10 to create a delay. 11 THE COURT: I certainly sympathize with you 12 and we'll do everything possible to assist you, as I 13 know that the government will, in this regard. Okay? 14 MR. WICKERSHAM: Thank you. 15 MR. MATANOSKI: Yes, ma'am. If I could just 16 follow up on that? 17 THE COURT: Please, please, Mr. Matanoski. 18 MR. MATANOSKI: Mr. Wickersham and I had a 19 discussion during one of the b reaks about that very 20 topic and we have offered the contact points that 21 we've made. Admittedly, this was very hurried up for 22 us and sort of recreating our steps might be difficult 23 to find some of the things that we want to. But we'd 24 be happy to share whatever we can, because we came in 25 in the same way as he expressed. We did not have Heritage Report ing Corporation (202) 628 -4888 Case 1:01-vv-00162 Document 127 Filed 03/11/08 Page 202 of 204 1013A RIMA - DIRECT (CONT'D) (REBUTTAL) 1 standing. We found a law that allowed us to go in and 2 file. 3 THE COURT: And it was not a law that 4 involved your government -to-government procedure as I 5 understood it. 6 MR. MATANOSKI: No. No, ma'am. This is 7 certainly not sovereign to sovereign as it has been 8 portrayed. It was, we came in, yes, our identity is a 9 sovereign, but we came into the court with no 10 different process than any other third party would. 11 THE COURT: Okay. 12 MR. MATANOSKI: Thank you. 13 THE COURT: All right. And I have not yet 14 established a briefing schedule in this case. I would 15 ask that all of the parties give some thought to that 16 this evening and that we be prepar ed to discuss that 17 tomorrow at the conclusion of the closing arguments. 18 Are there any other matters we can take up today? 19 MR. POWERS: Not for the Petitioners. 20 MR. MATANOSKI: Nor for the government. 21 THE COURT: All right. The Court's in 22 recess until 9 tomorrow morning. 23 (Whereupon, at 4:30 p.m., the hearing in the 24 above -entitled matter was recessed, to reconvene at 25 9:00 a.m. on Friday, November 9, 2007.)
