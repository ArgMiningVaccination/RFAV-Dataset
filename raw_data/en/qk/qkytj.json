UV exposure accelerates the progression of age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and cataracts. To guard against skin and eye damage: Choose the \"100 percent UV protection\" label on sunglasses to defend against the sun's glare on snowy slopes. Look for wraparound styles to shield eyelids from sunburn. Wear wide arms instead of thin wire frames to protect delicate skin at the sides of your eyes. Prevent sports-related injuries with shatter - proof lenses made from durable polycarbonate. Try newer kinds of photochromic lenses that darken when exposed to UV rays.Nearly three-quarters of all liquid soaps on grocery shelves display the word \"antibacterial\" on the label. But does adding triclosan (a chemical disinfectant) really make soap safer? \"No one has ever shown that antibacterial soap is any more effective than plain soap and water,\" says Brian Cooper, M.D., director of Hartford Hospital's Department of Infectious Disease. Despite marketing claims to the contrary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say anti - bacterial soaps are unnecessary and recommend washing hands thoroughly with ordinary soap and warm water to prevent infection. Researchers warn that the broad-spectrum disinfectant in liquid soap may create resistance to bactericidal agents over time. \"Possible links be - tween overuse of antibacterial soaps and the growth of antibiotic-resistant strains of microorganisms remain unproven,\" says Dr. Cooper, \"but it's clear that antibacterial soap is more expensive and no more useful than regular soap for home use.\" Before lathering up, consider the following: Sing \"Happy Birthday\" at least twice while washing your hands with soap and water to completely remove germs. Antibacterial soaps don't kill viruses that cause many common diseases. Before sloshing antibacterial soap suds down the drain, think about polluting Long Island Sound (wastewater treatment plants don't remove triclosan). Use hand sanitizer instead. Rubbing alcohol and weak bleach solution kill bacteria on surfaces just as well without promoting antibiotic resistance.

PIONEERING PROCEDURES When he learned his bladder needed to be removed, John Quinn was understandably apprehensive, but four months after undergoing reconstructive surgery the 71-year- old Newington resident is playing golf again. \"I had no pain from the surgery,\" he recalls with amazement. \"Now all my plumbing is intact and works fine.\" Cystectomy \u2014surgical removal of the bladder\u2014is often necessary for invasive cancer that has spread into the muscle wall. Aggressive tumors can be removed successfully with five-year survival rates of up to 80 percent. Surgery remains the \"gold standard\" in bladder cancer treatment, sometimes in combination with chemotherapy or radiation. But now a new surgical option is available: robotic cystec - tomy with the da Vinci robot. Whenever possible, Hartford Hospital surgeon Joseph Wagner, M.D., fashions a new organ, called a neobladder, us- ing the patient's own tissue. During an operation lasting up to eight hours, Dr. Wagner cuts a section of bowel, shapes it into a new bladder, stitches it to the urethra (the body's urine-flow outlet) and reconnects the severed intestine. Smaller scars, reduced pain, less blood loss and shorter recovery times are the advantages of minimally invasive surgery with the da Vinci robot. Just as in conventional laparoscopy, Dr. Wagner inserts instruments through tiny tubes, while a small abdominal incision (about three inches long) is used to remove the diseased organ and create a new one. \"The patient has to learn how to urinate using the new bladder,\" says Dr. Wagner, \"but it's a better alter - native than wearing a urine-collecting bag on the outside of the body.\" In the blinding brilliance of the operating room, sterile instruments are prepped and waiting. Scissors of all shapes and sizes fan out across blue-draped surfaces, but the real action takes place at a console across the room. Seated at the robotic controls, the surgeon scrutinizes images relayed to a 3-D viewfinder by a tiny fiberoptic camera. Instru - ments are manipulated by \"endowrists\" that twist and turn through the full range of motion. Innovations in robotic- assisted techniques have revolutionized surgical control and precision, automating complex and repetitive maneu - vers. Even the steadiest of human hands cannot match those of a surgical robot. While robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery to remove a cancerous prostate gland is a daily occurrence, Hartford Hospital is the only medical center in the state to routinely use the hospital's surgical robot for bladder cancer. In wom - en, the da Vinci is used for pelvic reconstructive surgery to repair a prolapsed uterus or vagina. \"Conventional surgery requires a long surgical incision that can take up to eight weeks to heal,\" says Christine LaSala, M.D., who with her partner, Paul K. Tulikangas, M.D., specializes in urogynecol - ogy and pelvic reconstructive surgery. \"The robot makes the procedure easier to perform so we can often avoid an abdominal incision.\"Surgical Mastery Minimally Invasive Reconstruction Using the da Vinci Surgical Robot Scenes from the Sleep Lab ...zzzzzzzzz 4Zzz ....In the hospital's newly renovated sleep laboratory, high-tech wizardry allows physicians to monitor what happens while someone sleeps. ...zzzzzzzzz Stressed and sleepless, many Americans spend their nights tossing and turning in the dark. According to the National Sleep Foundation, a third of adults in the United States sleep less than 6.5 hours per night\u2014about two hours less than their grandparents slept. While most people experience occasional insomnia, nearly 70 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep disorders that cost employers an estimated $18 billion annually in lost productivity. Fatigue is a factor in at least 100,000 car crashes and 1,500 deaths each year. A potentially deadly condition called sleep apnea afflicts an estimated 20 million Americans. Sleep apnea is associated with cardiovascular diseases like high blood pressure, heart attack, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and stroke. Most sufferers are unaware that their rest - less nights are filled with the noisy signals of a sleep disorder\u2014snoring, choking or gasping\u2014that they forget completely on awakening. Nightly snoring punctuated by long pauses between breaths is the telltale sound of obstruc - tive sleep apnea. Snoring occurs when an expelled breath squeezes through a too-small passage and vibrates the walls of the throat like a balloon rap - idly losing air. Obstructive sleep apnea can result when excess weight or narrowed airways cause the muscles of the throat to droop or collapse, block - ing the flow of air. When they can't exhale, people with obstructive sleep apnea stop breathing intermittently. \"Patients with obstructive sleep apnea often complain of daytime sleepiness or difficulty re - maining asleep,\" says Natalya Thorevska, M.D., who specializes in pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at Hartford Hospital's newly renovated sleep lab. \"Obstructive apneas cause fragmented sleep and lowered levels of oxygen in the blood. Symptoms of sleep apnea include loud snoring, breath holding, morning headaches and dry mouth and poorly controlled high blood pressure.\" While less severe sleep apnea symptoms may respond to weight loss or simply sleeping on the side, alcohol or sleeping pills can depress breathing and worsen disturbed slumber. Before menopause, women have a lower risk than men of developing sleep apnea, but once estrogen levels drop after menopause, women lose their hormonal advantage. Left untreated, obstructive sleep apnea can lead to serious health consequences, including fatigue-related accidents, heart disease, hypertension and diabetes. Untreated sleep apnea has been shown to raise the risk of death from motor vehicle accidents and cardiovascular disease. Not only do sleepless people crash their cars, but researchers have also linked sleep apnea with depression, irritability, forgetfulness and sexual dysfunction. \"Overweight people have a higher incidence of obstructive sleep apnea,\" says Dr. Thorevska. \"We evaluate patients clinically and confirm the diagnosis with a sleep study.\" Inside the Sleep Lab In the hospital's comfortable sleep laboratory, high-tech wizardry allows physicians to monitor exactly what happens while someone sleeps. The sleep lab is open six nights a week, including Sat - urday. Patients arrive by 7:30 or 8:00 p.m. so they can relax with graham cracker snacks and get used to the monitoring equipment before falling asleep. The state-of-the-art sleep lab on the eleventh floor accommodates up to six patients nightly in recently updated rooms with wood-trimmed fur - nishings and amenities like a flat-screen TV. While the subject sleeps, multiple wires, or \"leads,\" monitor brain waves, rapid eye movement (REM), respiratory flow and rate, muscle activity, heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels and snoring. A dozen leads are attached to the head and face, while additional sets run from the legs to the computer to detect any twitching or jerking that can signal a condition called \"periodic limb movement disorder.\" A highly trained sleep technologist stays in the sleep lab overnight to monitor the video recording and help hooked-up patients to the bathroom in the middle of the night. 5Natalya Y. Thorevska, M.D., recently joined Connecticut Multispecialty Group as a physi - cian specializing in pulmonary medicine, critical care medicine and sleep medicine. She earned her Board certification in Internal Medicine in 2003 and in Pulmo - nary Disease in 2005. A native of Ukraine, she graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk State Medical Academy, where she earned her Doctor of Medicine diploma with honors. At Hartford Hospital, she is medical director of the newly renovated state-of-the-art sleep lab, which treats nearly 100 patients per month for a variety of sleep disorders. Dr. Thorevska did her internship and residency in internal medicine at the Yale University/Bridgeport program and fellowships in pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at Loyola University Chicago's Stritch School of Medicine. An avid reader, Dr. Thorevska pre - fers European literature, primar - ily by Russian and French writers. The small abstract oils she paints for relaxation represent an avoca - tion she has enjoyed since taking art classes in her high school days. Natalya Y. Thorevska, M.D.PHYSICIAN PROFILE Armed with computer printouts of data collected during an eight- hour comprehensive sleep study, Dr. Thorevska can analyze sleep arousal disorders or verify a suspected diagnosis of sleep apnea. \"Every movement is recorded by the computer and plotted on-screen,\" she ex - plains. \"The sleep study confirms the results of the patient's sleep diary, as well as clinical observations that led to a referral to the sleep lab.\" To treat obstructive sleep apnea, patients are fitted with a continu - ous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device that gently blows a small amount of air into the nose and mouth to prevent the airway from collapsing. Some patients benefit from bi-level therapy, which provides two different pressure levels\u2014one for breathing in and the other for breathing out. \"Patients with sleep disordered breathing often expe - CPAP treatment,\" says Dr. Thorevska. \"A follow-up sleep study is usually required to properly adjust the fit and flow of pressurized air through the soft, comfortable mask that patients wear every night while sleeping.\" New Medications for Sleeplessness Bombarded by TV ads featuring lazily floating green moths, talking beavers and a chess-playing Abe Lincoln, insomniacs are increasingly turning to pharmaceuticals to escape their restless nights. Sleep may be a matter of life and death. \"The number of hours someone sleeps ap - pears to be related to mortality,\" says Dr. Thorevska. \"People who sleep less than seven or more than nine hours have higher mortality rates.\" Prescription medications offer hope for the truly sleep starved, but no long-term studies exist to show whether those heavily advertised drugs\u2014Sonata, Lunesta, Ambien and Rozerem, among others\u2014are safe over time. \"The big plus is that these new medications work at a level that does not cause addiction,\" says Dr. Thorevska. \"However, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved any sleep medications for chronic use. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be the most effective way to treat chronic insomnia.\" New medications for sleepless nights have largely replaced barbi - turates and benzodiazepines (common brand names include Halcion, Xanax and Valium) that have a high potential for abuse and can cause a next-day \"hangover.\" The 1990s brought a new class of non-benzodi - azepine sleep medications with names like Ambien, Lunesta and Sonata that have a lower risk of dependence. The newest sleep aid, Rozerem, has low abuse potential and acts on a region of the hypothalamus that regulates the normal sleep-wake cycle in a way that mimics melatonin, a hormone produced by the body. Although sold as a dietary supple - ment, synthetic melatonin seems to help jet-lag, but is not approved by the FDA. Over-the-counter antihistamine sleep medications are not a good choice. All prescription sleep medications are FDA-approved only for short-term use. Training the Brain Typically it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to fall asleep. Before reaching for a sleeping pill, Dr. Thorevska suggests training the brain by practicing good \"sleep hygiene\"\u2014no caffeine in the second half of the day (it stays in the brain for up to eight hours), avoiding heavy meals or exercise in the evening\u2014and going to bed only when it's time 6Sleep may be a matter of life and death. \"People who sleep less than seven or more than nine hours have higher mortality rates.\"to sleep. \"No reading, no watching TV, no listening to music\u2014no noise,\" she says. \"It's hard to change behavior, so instead people want a pill for a quick fix.\" Sleep deprivation affects appetite and metabolism, reducing energy and contributing to weight gain. Chronic sleeplessness has been shown to spur insulin resistance, which means that it takes more insulin for the body to respond normally, potentially leading to diabetes. Re - searchers at the University of Chicago have found that sleep loss sig - nificantly raises levels of ghrelin \u2014a hormone released by the stomach to trigger hunger. People who sleep less than seven hours a night are more likely to be obese than those who sleep seven hours or more. Most people seem to need about eight hours of sleep, although teenagers famously need more. Swing-shift workers and international travelers tend to lose sleep because of disrupted circadian rhythms governing core body temperature, hormone levels, heart rate and blood pressure. People with asthma often suffer from sleep-disrupting nighttime coughing, wheezing and breathlessness. Psychiatric disorders like anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder leave suffer - ers wakeful and weary, while sleeplessness may hasten a descent into depression. Nearly two-thirds of older adults, especially those in poor health, report experiencing a sleep problem several nights a week. For sleep-deprived adults, insomnia may be a debilitating illness afflicting both body and mind. Driven by tormenting dreams, night terrors, sleepwalking or nightmares, most sufferers seek medical help for these sleep disorders called parasomnias. While children usually out - grow sleepwalking or night terrors, violent sleep disturbances or arousal disorders that appear later in life may precede\u2014by as much as three to six years\u2014the development of Parkinson's disease or other neurological disorders that affect the central nervous system. The most common parasomnia is sleepwalking, which can involve sitting up in bed, raiding the refrigerator, having sex while asleep or leaving the house and driving long distances. Experts warn against violently shaking people wandering in a dazed or somnolent state since they may become more confused or agitated if awakened suddenly. Instead, gently guide the sleepwalker back to bed. While medications can be prescribed for sleepwalking, sleep experts recommend safety precautions like barring the windows, locking the doors, hiding the car keys and putting the mattress on the floor to prevent falls. From sleep apnea to snoring, sleepwalking or insomnia, it's all in a night's work in Hartford Hospital's sleep lab. As technicians watch the monitors in another room, patients snuggle under a blanket in quiet solitude. The muted d\u00e9cor makes the room a welcoming and restful environment for sleep. The private bathroom features a shower, hair - dryer, mirror and toiletries like shampoo, toothpaste and a toothbrush. Patients may bring their own pillow, wear their own pajamas and pass the hours in the lab dreaming of release from sleepless nights. After spending a night in Hartford Hospital's sleep lab to confirm a suspected diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, patients return for a follow-up visit. For the second overnight, they are fitted with a continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) device, which gently blows air into a comfortable mask through a long, flexible tube tethered to a portable bedside unit. 7SuperbugsStalking the Brian Cooper, M.D., is chief of Hartford Hospital's Division of Infectious Disease, Allergy and Immunology. 8In 1979, vaccination wiped the scourge of smallpox off the face of the earth and the world envi - sioned a future free of contagion. Less than 30 years later, virulent pathogens are rampant and terrifying new diseases like AIDS, Ebola and hepatitis C are flourishing amid fears of a looming global pan - demic of avian influenza. Antibiotic-resistant strains of \"flesh-eating\" bacteria strike suddenly and with deadly cunning. Worldwide, many strains of Staphylococcus aureus are already resistant to many standard antibiot - ics. Whether caused by drugs being over-prescribed for routine infections (or uselessly against viruses) or overuse of antibacterial agents in consumer and agricultural products, antibiotic resistance is frighteningly real. The antibiotic stockpile continues to dwindle as bacteria mutate in response to the onslaught of disease-fighting drugs. Public health experts warn of a modern-day plague when rampaging infections evolve into unstop - pable killers. After years of decline, death rates from life-threatening infections are on the rise. Deadly strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) have swept sports teams, barracks, daycare centers, nursing homes and hospitals, sidelining professional athletes and killing otherwise healthy newborns. The antibiotic age began with the accidental dis - covery of the \"miracle drug\" penicillin nearly 70 years ago, creating an era of optimism about the power of pharmaceuticals. Paradoxically, antibiotics worked almost too fast and too well. By the 1980s, drug companies had turned their attention to conquering more profitable diseases. Bacteria swap genes and mutate rapidly in re - sponse to antibiotics. As resistant strains multiply, drug companies fear wasting millions on research to develop a drug that might quickly lose its efficacy\u2014 and market share. While disease-causing microbes replicate dozens of times daily, it takes years of research to develop a new antibiotic. \"Drug companies can easily spend $800 million developing a new antibiotic,\" explains Brian Cooper, M.D., director of Hartford Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases. \"If a new drug doesn't work or has unacceptable side effects, the manufacturer loses millions in profits they could be earning from easier to develop 'me-too' drugs.\" Emergence of virulent pathogens resistant to first-line antibiotics has made managing common bacterial infections more complicated. \"Ten years ago, the antibiotics used for skin and soft tissue infections served us well,\" says Dr. Cooper. \"Now we have to revise our approach to these infections using a different panel of antibiotics. On a national level the Infectious Diseases Society of America is asking government to support research into new antibiotic development through its 'Bad Bugs, No Drugs' campaign.\" Because the right antibiotic can mean the differ - ence between life and death, researchers across the globe are calling for development of new antibiot - ics. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved only two truly novel antibiotics since 1998. Even Vancomycin\u2014the once-invincible antibiotic\u2014 has developed pockets of resistance. Hartford Hospital's Center for Anti-Infective Research and Development is an international leader in drug discovery. With funding from pharmaceuti - cal companies, the center does early assessments of novel compounds. Last year, it received nearly $2.5 million to fund research into how drugs work\u2014and how to use old drugs in new ways. The center's global surveillance project, the OPTAMA Program, is analyzing worldwide antibiotic resistance trends in order to advise clinicians about which antibiotic is likely to be most effective in a particular geographic region. The center's direc - tor, David P. Nicolau, Pharm.D., and his colleagues collaborate with investigators as far-flung as the Americas, Europe, Serbia and China. \"Surveillance studies are an important tool to track emerging resistance,\" explains Dr. Nicolau. \"Do drugs work differently in the old and young? What antibiotic is the best choice for critically ill patients? We found that significant differences in antibiotic resistance exist throughout the world\u2014 and even in intensive care units in Hartford and San Francisco.\" Infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacte - ria can strike anyone\u2014the young and the old, the healthy and the chronically ill. \"The best way to prevent resistance is to stop using an antibiotic for a while,\" says Dr. Cooper. \"If an organism isn't con - stantly mutating, it loses its resistance over time.\" Methicillin-resistant Staphylocococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria. MRSA bacteria have developed antibiotic resistance. 9 | in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE | WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & BreakthroughsGifts of Life Citrus Bonus Rich with vitamin C, limes and lemons have anti- inflammatory and antibi - otic effects. Citrus fruits contain compounds called phytochemicals with unique antioxidant and anti-cancer properties. Limes have been shown to stop cell division in cancer cell lines. The World Health Organization and Tufts University urge older adults to consume phytochemical-dense citrus, but warn that grapefruit may interfere with heart medications or other drugs. SIDS: Back to Sleep Babies who die of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) have a defect in the part of the brainstem that controls breathing and sleep-wake cycles, say the National Institutes of Health. They are less able to use serotonin, which affects respiratory reflexes that normally awaken babies to prevent suffocation. Put - ting infants to bed on their backs helps prevent SIDS. Deadly Disparity The National Institutes of Health want to know why African American women die of breast cancer more often than whites or Hispanics despite identical treatment. Tumor biology may explain why African- American women are more likely to have aggressive pre-menopausal breast cancer with poor progno - sis, say University of Texas researchers in the journal Cancer. Breast cancer kills 40,000 American women each year.A 100-day Cough Whooping cough, or pertus - sis, is back with a vengeance in adolescents and adults, warn the Centers for Disease Control. Highly contagious Bordetella pertussis bacteria produce toxins that narrow airways in the upper respira - tory tract, causing prolonged coughing spells. Since immu - nity from vaccination wanes over time, the CDC recom - mends periodic booster shots for teenagers and adults under 65.Recently, five trauma victims\u2014four of them under age 24\u2014died within a nine-day period in Greater Hartford. They gave the gift of life through organ donation to 25 people in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland. The United States is far from maximizing its supply of organs, and an average of 17 people die each day waiting. More than 93,000 Americans are on lung, heart, kidney, liver, pancreas and intestine waiting lists. More than 200 people are waiting in the Hartford area. In 2003, the National Organ Donation Breakthrough Collaborative was established with the purpose of saving lives by spreading best practices related to donation to the nation's largest hospitals. LifeChoice Donor Services, the organ procurement organiza - tion for this area, partnered with Hartford Hospital in the collaborative. The rise in transplanted organs\u2014from nine in 2003 to 60 in 2005\u2014is the result of the efforts by the hospital's partnership. Hartford Hospital's Organ and Tissue Donation Advisory Board (ODAC) provides hospital-wide leadership in implementing initiatives from the national level. The team has developed comprehensive practices to raise awareness about organ donation to help physicians, staff and families during the important hours at the end of life. Family mem - bers may be asked to give their consent for organ donation, or donors can indicate their consent through the Connecticut Donor Registry when applying for a driver's license. One of the trauma patients who recently died was a young woman from the Greater Hartford area. Her gift of life to others resulted in the donation of organs that saved the lives of six people across the country. Thanks to the collaborative effort at Hartford Hos - pital, and the patient's generous and understanding family, the recipients\u2014two women and four men\u2014are enjoying life today. 10When a loved one dies, survivors battle feelings of lone - liness, anger, guilt and sorrow as they struggle to find meaning in loss. When a family loses someone unexpectedly, there is the devastating shock of tragedy. For cancer survi - vors who cling to life through endless rounds of remission and recurrence, death comes slowly. Mourning begins long before death when a loved one is dying of cancer. At Hartford Hospital, the Palliative Medicine Consult Service is on call to help patients and families facing the prospect of ending treatment for grave illnesses. Today, the term \"palliative\" care has come to mean comfort measures designed to manage symptoms, relieve pain and offer emotional or spiritual support to patients and their families during what are often, but not always, the patient's last days. The palliative care team includes physicians, a psychia - trist, a nurse, a social worker, a chaplain and a pharmacist, as well as anesthesiologists and other specialists as needed. The hospital's transdisciplinary approach allows the entire team to share knowledge and expertise. \"The goal is for all of us to learn the skills of each other's care,\" says Evan Fox, M.D., who serves as psychiatric liaison to the consult ser - vice. \"We care for the family, not just the identified patient, with dignity, compassion and understanding. The grieving process is initiated as individuals are able to accept any loss, including the end of life.\" Hartford Hospital's palliative care team seeks to provide solace and comfort for both patients and families as they pass through the five stages of a terminal illness\u2014denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance\u2014described by Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross in her groundbreaking book, On Death and Dying. \"People may go through all these stages as they reconcile their loss,\" says Dr. Fox. \"While all this is Bereavement Support at Hartford HospitalGrieving the Loss happening, a parallel process occurs for staff members who care for the patient. Death involves every caring person in dealing with physical, spiritual, psychological and social issues. We view care holistically, which includes symptom management, all types of pain control and end of life care.\" Palliative care is not just for cancer, but also for such chronic illnesses as stroke, AIDS and end-stage cardiovas - cular or lung disease. While patients want vigorous treat - ment of pain, they may readily give up on medical heroics. Seriously ill people are often anxious to relieve the burden their suffering has placed on their loved ones. Holidays can bring memories of happier times for forlorn families. Well-meaning friends may urge grief-stricken indi - viduals to \"move on\" or \"get past\" their sorrow. Not every family grieves in the same way, and while there may be other co-existing problems\u2014depression and anxiety\u2014com - munication and connection allow mourners to cope despite their grief. At Hartford Hospital, volunteers write sympathy cards to families and keep in touch by phone for a year after someone dies. While the hospital provides memorial ser - vices and lists of bereavement support groups, grief takes time to resolve. Hartford Hospital is committed to assisting families and friends after the loss of their loved ones.

Recipe photo accessories courtesy of the Hartford Hospital Auxiliary Gift Shop.Preheat oven to 350\u00ba. Thaw, drain and press spinach in a sieve to squeeze out excess water. In a large bowl mix egg substitute, cottage cheese, Feta or cheddar cheese, and scallion. Add melted margarine, flour, pepper and dill. Stir to blend well. Fold in spinach. Spray a 9\" x 9\" or 12\" x 8\" pan with non-stick spray. Pour spinach mix into pan and even out with back of a spoon. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top and place in oven. Bake for about 50 minutes. Allow to cool, then cut into 12 servings. Serves 12.Frozen spinach offers a safe and convenient way to enjoy the healthful benefits of leafy green vegetables. While the chances of being infected by E. coli bacteria from eating bagged fresh spinach is low, outbreaks of disease occur sporadically. Accord - ing to the Food and Drug Administration, a particularly deadly strain of illness-causing pathogen (O157:H7) has been linked to 20 poisoning episodes in raw spinach and lettuce since 1995. Growers worry that the country's estimated $374 million spin - ach business will never recover from the recent outbreak that killed three people and sickened nearly 200 others. Most often, virulent illness results from eating E. coli -tainted hamburgers rare. While cooking kills organisms on the surface of a steak, a hamburger made from ground meat may still have bacteria lurking in its soft, pink center. Processed spinach is usually blanched with bacteria- destroying hot water or steam prior to being frozen. According to experts, frozen, canned or cooked spinach is safe to eat.
