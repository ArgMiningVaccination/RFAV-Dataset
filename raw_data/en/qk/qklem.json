This is killer Thai, elevated and prepared with care. Herb offers both a three- and six-course prix-fixe dinner at tremendous value, but Chef/owner Patty Neumson's cooking is light (and delicious) enough to go the distance. A sample menu might begin with a cool pile of crunchy green papaya, carrot, and cucumber, laced in a beautifully balanced lime dressing with crispy vermicelli noodles and peanuts. Then move on to tofu and kabocha in a deliciously complex coconut curry full of wilted basil and heat. Soft glass noodles find their match in saut\u00e9ed onions, fresh crab, and crunchy shrimp.
