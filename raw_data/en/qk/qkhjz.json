Our goal was to find out whether the intake of antibiotics during pregnancy and by children differs according to whether the mothers have alternative or conventional lifestyles. Therefore, we investigated the use of antibiotics by pregnant women and by children up to 11 years of age participating in the KOALA Birth Cohort Study. This cohort comprises two recruitment groups of mother-infant pairs, one with alternative lifestyles (selected via organic food shops, anthroposophic clinicians and midwives, anthroposophic under-five clinics, Rudolf Steiner schools and relevant magazines, n = 491) the other with conventional lifestyles (no selection based on lifestyle, n = 2343). Mothers in the alternative lifestyle group more frequently adhered to specific living rules and identified themselves with anthroposophy more than mothers in the conventional lifestyle group. The results revealed significant differences in antibiotic use during pregnancy and in children from 3 months to 10 years of age between the two groups. The rate of antibiotic use in children was consistently lower in the alternative lifestyle group than in the conventional lifestyle group. Antibiotic use in pregnancy was higher in low educated women, and maternal antibiotic use during lactation was higher after an instrumented delivery in hospital. Antibiotic use in the infant was higher when they had older sibs or were born in hospital, and lower in those who had been longer breastfed. After adjustment for these factors, the differences in antibiotic use between the alternative and conventional groups remained. The results suggest that an alternative lifestyle is associated with cautious antibiotic use during pregnancy, lactation and in children.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-07-09", "cleaned_text": "Influence of Alternative Lifestyles on Antibiotic Use during Pregnancy, Lactation and in Children [https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10070837](https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10070837) [Natural Antimicrobials /journal/antibiotics/special_issues/Alternative_Plant_Antibio )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-antibiotics-10-00837)]), antibiotic resistance is a major public health problem worldwide, to a large extent caused by the inappropriate and excessive use of antibiotics. Several studies show that despite recommendations for rational antibiotic use, their consumption is still higher than ideal (see [ [2](#B2-antibiotics-10-00837)] for an example). Therefore, measures to reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics are urgently needed. [3](#B3-antibiotics-10-00837), [4](#B4-antibiotics-10-00837), [5](#B5-antibiotics-10-00837), [6](#B6-antibiotics-10-00837), [7](#B7-antibiotics-10-00837)]. Antibiotic use in children may not only contribute to spreading antibiotic resistance but also affect children's health. Previous studies have shown that antibiotic exposure early in life can affect weight development in children [ [8](#B8-antibiotics-10-00837), [9](#B9-antibiotics-10-00837), [10](#B10-antibiotics-10-00837)]. Repeated use of antibiotics, particularly broad-spectrum antibiotics, in children under 24 months of age also seems to be a risk factor for developing childhood obesity [ [8](#B8-antibiotics-10-00837)]. Moreover, exposure to antibiotics before the age of 6 months, or repeatedly during childhood, has been associated with increased body weight in healthy children [ [9](#B9-antibiotics-10-00837)]. [11](#B11-antibiotics-10-00837)]. The aim of the present analysis of KOALA data was to find out whether the intake of antibiotics by children differs according to whether the mothers have alternative or conventional lifestyles. The results might not only motivate pediatricians to better consider antibiotic prescriptions for children and how to deal with parents' expectations but also alert them to the need for lifestyle-tailored use recommendations. 2. Results 2.1. Demographic, Lifestyle and Health-Related Characteristics [Table 1](#antibiotics-10-00837-t001), mothers of the alternative lifestyle group were on average 2 years older at delivery (33.7 vs. 31.7 years) and more often had a higher education (72.7% vs. 42.5%). [Table 2](#antibiotics-10-00837-t002)). Similar frequencies between the two recruitment groups were found concerning the frequency of Candida infections in the mouth (during the pregnancy), as well as fever and flu (after the third month of pregnancy). 2.2. Antibiotic Use [Figure 1](#antibiotics-10-00837-f001), several significant differences between the two groups were found for antibiotics use by pregnant women and by children during the first 12 months of life. During pregnancy, 9.4% (46/489) of the participants in the alternative lifestyle group and 13.7% (321/2337) of the participants in the conventional lifestyle group used antibiotics (p = 0.026). In the last month of pregnancy, the antibiotics use was lower (2.9% vs. 4.4%) and the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.144). After delivery, a significant difference was found between both groups in the use of penicillin or other antibiotics during breastfeeding (p = 0.003): within the alternative group, 9.8% (44/447) of the breastfeeding women used antibiotics; in the conventional group, 15.5% (252/1631) did so. [Table 1](#antibiotics-10-00837-t001)), we set out to evaluate whether some of these characteristics could at least in part explain the differences in antibiotics consumption during pregnancy and lactation (see [Table 3](#antibiotics-10-00837-t003)). During pregnancy, the difference between use of antibiotics in the two groups remained statistically significant even when maternal education and organic food choice were included. This was found to be true even though maternal education per se was associated with more frequent antibiotic use (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.13-2.09). The difference between antibiotic use during lactation in the two groups remained statistically significant even when maternal education was included in the logistic regression model. Finally, it remained significant when including delivery mode (artificial vs. vaginal at home) and the number of older siblings. Maternal education per se was not associated with different antibiotic use during lactation. [Figure 2](#antibiotics-10-00837-f002)). Furthermore, the differences in antibiotic use between the alternative and the conventional groups also increased with age. Within the alternative group, statistically significantly fewer antibiotics were used than in the conventional group at all time-points except in the case of penicillin at 3 months of age (p = 0.052). The difference in antibiotic use between the conventional and alternative groups was relatively small between 3 and 7 months of age (1.3%; 2.5%; 3.1%), but it increased over time from 7 months to 2 years of age (5.6%; 4.5%; regression, this manifested as lower ORs with 95% CIs that excluded 1.0 (see [Table 4](#antibiotics-10-00837-t004)), with the strongest association in the first year (ORs about 0.5). When adjusted in multivariable models, the association attenuated somewhat (to 0.6), but the 95% CIs still excluded 1.0, indicating that the other factors only partially explained the difference in antibiotic use between the alternative and conventional lifestyle groups. Maternal education and age were unrelated to antibiotic use. Risk factors for antibiotic use in the first year were hospital delivery (vs. home delivery, which had the strongest association for antibiotic use in the 8-12 month period) and having one or more older siblings; while breastfeeding duration showed a protective association (see [Table 4](#antibiotics-10-00837-t004)). For antibiotic use in the second year, all these factors had no impact any more, while the difference between the alternative and conventional groups was retained, albeit in a less pronounced manner than in the first year (OR: 0.72). Anthroposophic orientation and use of organic foods were unrelated to children's antibiotic use in multivariate models and did not change the difference between the alternative and conventional groups, and they were omitted from the final models. [Figure 3](#antibiotics-10-00837-f003)). Fewer children in the alternative lifestyle group than in the conventional group underwent antibiotic treatments. In most cases, the difference in antibiotic treatment between the two groups proved to be significant. This difference was relatively large at the age of 6-7 years and decreased as the children got older (8.6%; 5.2%; 4.9%; 0.8%). [Figure 4](#antibiotics-10-00837-f004)shows that, in the two lifestyle groups, the majority of the children had no antibiotics treatments (i.e., 0 = zero antibiotic treatments per person-year), but it also reveals several differences between the two lifestyle groups. Firstly, the percentage of children with 0 antibiotic treatments per person-year was higher in the alternative group than in the conventional group. In addition, the percentages of children with between 1-2 antibiotic treatments and 2-3 antibiotic treatments per year were lower in the alternative lifestyle group than they were in the conventional lifestyle group. 3. Discussion [12](#B12-antibiotics-10-00837)]. According to OECD data, average antibiotic consumption in the Netherlands was about 12 defined daily doses per day (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants in 2014, which was approximately half of the average OECD consumption; no increase was observed between 2005 and 2014 [ [12](#B12-antibiotics-10-00837)]. The fact that lifestyle influences antibiotics consumption suggests that even in the Netherlands a considerable portion of the prescriptions are not really needed. This is in line with results showing that in the Netherlands approximately 50% of antibiotic prescriptions for bronchitis, tonsillitis and sinusitis were not issued in accordance with guidelines [ [13](#B13-antibiotics-10-00837)]. It appears conceivable that, in countries with higher consumption, stronger effects from lifestyle can be expected. Interestingly, the lower consumption of antibiotics was already apparent during pregnancy (30% fewer antibiotic treatments in the alternative lifestyle group), a period in which decisions have to be particularly carefully considered, as infections may negatively affect the course of pregnancy, as well as mothers' and children's health [ [14](#B14-antibiotics-10-00837)], at the same time that any unnecessary treatment should be avoided. The lower consumption of antibiotics during pregnancy in the alternative lifestyle group relative to the conventional group could in part be associated with the lower prevalence of urinary infections in that group. The similar (or even higher) frequency of the remaining infectious diseases and fever in the alternative group speaks against such associations however. Finally, the obstetric outcomes, duration of pregnancy and birth weight were comparable between the two groups, suggesting that the (30%) lower antibiotic use did not have negative consequences. [15](#B15-antibiotics-10-00837)]. Similarly, a survey on parental knowledge, attitudes and practice of antibiotic treatment in children found that low parental education was the most important independent risk factor positively related to antibiotic use [ [16](#B16-antibiotics-10-00837)]. Our results confirm that lower education is associated with higher antibiotic use during pregnancy (but not during lactation). Differences in maternal education (which can also be taken as an income indicator) did not, however, explain the observed differences between antibiotic treatment during pregnancy\u2014nor during lactation\u2014in the alternative and conventional lifestyle groups. Differences in antibiotic use during lactation between the two lifestyle groups were due neither to distinct maternal education levels nor to delivery mode (artificial vs. vaginal at home) or number of older siblings (as an indicator for maternal experience). [17](#B17-antibiotics-10-00837)], our results corroborated that breastfeeding protects against infections in the first year of life. Moreover, they revealed more frequent antibiotic treatments in children delivered in hospital (relative to home deliveries that are usual in the Netherlands), which may be related to medicalization (e.g., parents being more inclined to seek medical care), but perhaps also to a higher risk of breastfeeding problems (especially after cesarean operations). Older siblings were included as an indicator of maternal experience with child care (expected to lead to, e.g., more non-antibiotic home medication for a feverish child) but the results indicated a higher antibiotic use (likely due to older siblings being a source of infections). Finally, the alternative lifestyle group included a considerable proportion of families with an anthroposophic orientation and users of organic foods ( [Table 1](#antibiotics-10-00837-t001)). Adherence to anthroposophy is likely to be associated with-but not conditio sine qua non for-the use of anthroposophic medicine. This type of medicine (see below) advocates prudent use of childhood vaccination and antibiotic use to favor the development of natural immunity to infections in children [ [18](#B18-antibiotics-10-00837)]. However, the association between adherence to anthroposophy and antibiotic use was weak in our study. Also, organic food consumption during pregnancy (as indicator of investment in prudent or nature-oriented lifestyles) was not associated with antibiotic use. Neither adherence to anthroposophy not organic food consumption explained the lower use in the alternative group. Other lifestyle characteristics that strongly influence antibiotic use\u2014be it during pregnancy, lactation or early childhood\u2014deserve further investigations. [19](#B19-antibiotics-10-00837)] and patients' expectations and physicians' assumptions regarding these expectations are\u2014next to diagnostic uncertainty\u2014important factors leading to over-prescription of antibiotics [ [20](#B20-antibiotics-10-00837), [21](#B21-antibiotics-10-00837), [22](#B22-antibiotics-10-00837)]. This suggests that physicians have to be trained not only to prescribe fewer antibiotics, but also to communicate the disadvantages of unnecessary use of antibiotics to lay people, namely to their patients and, in the case of child patients, their parents. Especially in situations in which parents are anxious, as frequently happens when children have a fever and specific symptoms, is it important that physicians are able to deliver consistent and reliable information [ [21](#B21-antibiotics-10-00837)]. In addition, simple measures, such as introducing an illness-focused interactive booklet, might have positive effects [ [23](#B23-antibiotics-10-00837)]. Since the knowledge and attitude of patients concerning antibiotics can possibly influence physicians' expectations [ [19](#B19-antibiotics-10-00837)], their improvement should also be a goal of public health measures. It should be kept in mind that interventions aimed at reducing the intentions to use antibiotics among of in child-bearing age may contribute to slowing down the development of antibiotic resistance and reducing the negative side effects of antibiotics in children. [24](#B24-antibiotics-10-00837), [25](#B25-antibiotics-10-00837)] promotes a restricted use of antibiotics at the same time that supportive treatments are developed and actively used. Especially in respiratory and ear infections\u2014two very frequent indications for antibiotic use in children\u2014anthroposophic physicians tend to prescribe fewer antibiotics [ [26](#B26-antibiotics-10-00837)]. In both types of infections, there is a broad discussion on the advantages of watchful waiting (see [ [27](#B27-antibiotics-10-00837)] and [ [28](#B28-antibiotics-10-00837)], respectively). At least in the case of some types of otitis media, a multimodal approach that includes several non-invasive supportive therapies (pneumatization exercises, education, an antiallergenic diet, nasal hygiene, useful constitutional therapy and thermal interventions; e.g., P.E.A.N.U.T.) appears to contribute to the success of waiting [ [29](#B29-antibiotics-10-00837)]. The fact that physicians with training in anthroposophic medicine hold longer consultations than is usual in conventional medicine (see [ [30](#B30-antibiotics-10-00837)]) could also contribute to taking the risk of not prescribing antibiotics right away. Finally, it is conceivable that further therapies from complementary medicine may contribute to reducing unnecessary antibiotics consumption [ [31](#B31-antibiotics-10-00837)]. [32](#B32-antibiotics-10-00837)]. By emphasizing the importance of co-existing parental lifestyles in the use of antibiotics during pregnancy and during the first years of their offspring's lives, our work adds to the ongoing discussion. Information and recommendations should also take aspects of lifestyle into consideration. A more detailed\u2014possibly qualitative\u2014investigation of the reasons behind the restrictive use of antibiotics associated with alternative lifestyles might unveil new possibilities for improving motivation in the general population. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Study Population [18](#B18-antibiotics-10-00837)]. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands, and written informed consent was given by the parents of the participating children. From October 2000 to December 2002, a total of 3030 pregnant women were recruited at 34 weeks of pregnancy. Pregnant women with a conventional lifestyle (n = 2343) were recruited from an ongoing prospective cohort study on pregnancy-related pelvic pain in the Netherlands [ [18](#B18-antibiotics-10-00837)]. The other group of pregnant women (n = 491) were recruited through alternative lifestyle-related channels, such as organic food shops, anthroposophic general practitioners and midwives, anthroposophic under-five clinics, Rudolf Steiner schools and relevant magazines [ [18](#B18-antibiotics-10-00837)]. 4.2.
