The workshop provided insights into the diverse range of traditional Chinese medicine treatments available and how they can benefit physical and mental wellbeing. Traditional Chinese medicine is an important part of Chinese culture and has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, focusing on the balance and harmony of the body, mind and spirit. \"Traditional Chinese medicine has low side-effects, if used correctly, and provides immediate results,\" Zhang said. The audience was also invited to taste rose tea, which is another form of traditional Chinese medicine to solve digestive problems. \"The belief in the healing properties of certain foods and herbs is deeply rooted in Chinese culture and has been passed on from generation to generation. Traditional Chinese medicine is also becoming more popular outside of China,\" said Yuan Yuan, director of the China Cultural Centre in Malta. In 2010, acupuncture and moxibustion of traditional Chinese medicine were enlisted in UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. \"It is exciting to see that the cultural exchanges between China and Malta in the field of traditional Chinese medicine have been exemplified by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Centre at the University of Malta, established in 2015, and the Mediterranean Regional Centre for Traditional Chinese Medicine, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. Such momentum is a testament to the open-mindedness and inclusiveness "}
