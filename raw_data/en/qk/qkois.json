COVID-19 Testing Information If you are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms and are in need of non-urgent COVID-19 testing, we encourage you to visit your local retail pharmacy or your local Department of Health website for testing locations or information about at-home testing kits. Due to limited supplies, our urgent cares are only providing tests for those with urgent medical needs. See testing options based on your location Which option best describes you? In Clinic Testing & Virtual Screening - You may experience longer wait times for in clinic testing. - Based on your symptoms, we recommend either a virtual visit or at home testing. See testing options for more information. COVID-19 PCR Test for Patients Not Showing Symptoms - Many of our Labcorp locations are accepting appointments and walk-ins for COVID-19 testing (for those who are symptom-free and have no known exposure to COVID-19). - You must purchase the test online before visiting a Labcorp location - Not all locations are participating, [check availability](https://www.labcorp.com/labs-and-appointments?service=COVID_19)before purchasing your test. Frequently Asked Questions Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html) The following people should get tested for COVID-19: - People with COVID-19 [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). - People WITHOUT symptoms of COVID-19 but who: - Have come into [close contact](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact)with someone with COVID-19, regardless of vaccination status. The COVID-19 test should be done at least 5 days after the close contact occurred. The date of the last close contact is considered day 0. Day 1 is the first full day after your last contact with a person who has had COVID-19. - Are not fully vaccinated for COVID-19 vaccine and are prioritized for expanded [community screening](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html)for COVID-19. - People regardless of their vaccination status who have been asked or referred to get testing by their school, workplace, healthcare provider, have [tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html), as long as they do not develop new symptoms, do not need to get tested. Source: [Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus) PCR tests detect the presence of the virus's genetic material using a technique called reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR. For this test, a sample may be collected through a nasal or throat swab, or a saliva sample may be used. The sample is typically sent to a laboratory where coronavirus RNA (if present) is extracted from the sample and converted into DNA. The DNA is then amplified, meaning that many copies of the viral DNA are made, in order to produce a measurable result. The accuracy of any diagnostic test depends on many factors, including whether the sample was collected properly, when during the course of illness, the testing was done, and whether the sample was maintained in appropriate conditions while it was shipped to the laboratory. Generally, PCR tests are highly accurate. Antigen tests detect specific proteins on the surface of the coronavirus. They are sometimes referred to as rapid diagnostic tests because it can take less than an hour to get test results. Positive antigen test results are highly specific, meaning that if you test positive you are very likely infected. However, there is a higher chance of false negatives with antigen tests, which means that a negative result cannot definitively rule out an active infection. If you have a negative result on an antigen test, your doctor may order a PCR test or a second rapid antigen test to confirm the result. It may be helpful to think of a COVID antigen test as you would think of a rapid strep test or a rapid flu test. A positive result for any of these tests is likely to be accurate, and allows diagnosis and treatment to begin quickly, while a negative result often results in further testing to confirm or overturn the initial result. Source: Providence Antigen test results may come back in as little as 15 to 45 minutes. PCR test results take between 24 and 48 hours. However, due to the surge in COVID-19 cases, there is a high demand for COVID-19 diagnostic testing, causing delays in test results. Rapid antigen test results may take hours and PCR results may take several days. Source: Providence You may receive test results from MyChart, QR codes, or through Labcorp.

[Symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)of COVID-19, including if you are awaiting test results or have not been tested. If you have symptoms, isolate yourself even if you do not know if you have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19. Isolation is used to separate people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 from those without COVID-19. People who are in isolation should stay home until it's safe for them to be around others. At home, anyone sick or infected should separate from others and wear a [well-fitting mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/effective-masks.html) when they need to be around others. People in isolation should stay in a specific \"sick room\" or area and use a separate bathroom if available. Everyone who has presumed or confirmed COVID-19 should stay home and isolate from other people for at least 5 full days (day 0 is the first day of symptoms or the date of the day of the positive viral test for asymptomatic persons). After completing isolation, they should wear a mask when around others at home and in public for an additional 5 days.

If you don't have symptoms, you may receive a false result. If positive, you should seek a confirmatory PCR test from an authorized lab. Source: Providence The cost for a COVID-19 test can vary depending on several factors, including the type of test, where the test is provided and processed, and an individual's insurance provider and coverage. For those who are insured, it's recommended patients contact their insurance provider to understand coverage and if there are any out-of-pocket costs for testing. Some insurers are covering both in-facility and at-home test kits. Additionally, many health centers and local- and state-supported test sites are providing free and/or discounted testing options for those who are eligible. At-home testing kits are also available for purchase online and in many retail pharmacies.
