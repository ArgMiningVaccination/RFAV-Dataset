We conducted a test-negative [case-control study]and recruited the test-positive cases and test-negative controls in the outbreak caused by Omicron BA.2 in April 2022 in Guangzhou, [China]. All the participants were 3 years and older. The [vaccination]status between the case group and the [control group]was compared in the vaccinated and all participants, respectively, to estimate the immune [protection]of inactivated [COVID-19 vaccines]. After adjusting for [sex]and 95% CI 0.011 to 0.727) had a more superior protective effect. Compared with one [dose], the second [dose]was more effective in [males](OR = 0.090), as well as two doses (OR = 0.089) and three doses (OR = 0.090) among individuals [aged]18-59. Whereas, when compared with the unvaccinated, one [dose](OR = 7.715, 95% CI 1.904 to 31.254) and (OR = 2.055, 95% CI 1.162 to 3.635) could contribute to the increased [risk]of Omicron [infection]after adjusting for [sex]and age. Meanwhile, by contrast with unvaccinated individuals, the result of increased [risk]was also manifested in the first [dose]in [males](OR = 12.400) and one [dose](OR = 21.500), two doses (OR = 1.890), and a booster [dose](OR = 1.945) in people [aged]18-59. In conclusion, the protective effect of full and booster [vaccination]with inactivated [COVID-19 vaccines]exceeded the incomplete [vaccination], of which three doses were more effective. Nevertheless, [vaccination]may increase the [risk]of Omicron [infection]compared with unvaccinated people. This may result from the [transmission]traits of BA.2, the particularity and stronger [protection] [awareness]of the unvaccinated [population], as well as the ADE effect induced by the decrease of antibody titers after a long [time]of [vaccination]. It is crucial to explore this issue in depth for the formulation "}
