Because its mechanisms of action are still unclear, we investigated the mechanism of action of CHEA against AHL in mice using proteomics techniques. Methods: Eighteen C57BL/6J mice at 1 month of age were randomly divided into three groups: (A) mice received drinking water until 2 months of age, K2M); (B) mice received drinking water until 7 months of age to induce AHL, K7M; (C) mice received drinking water containing CHEA daily until 7 months of age, Z7M. At 2 or 7 months mice were sacrificed and their cochleae were removed for proteomics analysis. Results: The numbers of proteins with a false discovery rate (FDR) <1% were respectively 5873 for qualitative and 5492 for quantitative statistics. The numbers of proteins with differential enrichment at least 1.5-fold (p<0.05) were respectively 351 for K7M vs K2M groups, 52 for Z7M vs K7M groups, 264 for Z7M vs K2M groups. The differentially expressed proteins in the Z7M group were involved in synaptic molecular transmission, energy metabolism, immune response, antioxidant defenses, and anti-apoptosis. Conclusion: The TCM CHEA played a protective role against AHL in mice by regulating the expression of specific proteins and genes in cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. Besides the pathways expected to be involved (antioxidant and anti-apoptosis), proteins related to immune response are a new finding of the present study.
