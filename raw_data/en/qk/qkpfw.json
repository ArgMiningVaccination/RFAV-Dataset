It is not intended to be a substitute for one's clinical decision-making regarding the progression of a patient's postoperative course based on their physical exam/findings, individual progress, and/or the presence of post-operative complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a postoperative patient, they should consult with Dr. Roe. Phase I - ACUTE (0-6 Weeks): Goals: Protect repair and manage symptoms. Range of Motion (ROM): *No aggressive stretching ER or flexion. - 0-2 weeks - Flex: 75, ER: 15, IR: (scapular - - 110, ER: 35, IR: 30 (scapular - - 150, 55, IR: Full (scapular plane). Sling use: - 0-4 weeks - for comfort and use outside of home. - 4+ weeks - DC per MD. Strengthening and conditioning: - 0-2 weeks - - Active elbow, wrist, hand ROM. - Biking and elliptical (in sling). - 2-4 weeks - - Light 3-way isometrics at 0 (flexion, ABD, EXT). - Scapular retractions and bent over rows. - Lower extremity strengthening (in sling). - 4-6 weeks - - Light band rows (no extension past midline). - Resistance band IR and ER exercises. - Lower extremity strengthening (lunges, squats). - Ladder drills, slide board (in sling). Criteria for progression: - Time: 6 weeks post-op. - < 2/10 pain. - DC sling per MD. Phase II - INTERMEDIATE (6-12 Weeks): Goals: Progress overhead ROM, normalize joint mobility, and enhance UE strength. Range of Motion (ROM): *No aggressive stretching ER or flexion. - 6-8 weeks: progress flexion to symmetry and ER to 60 (at side). - 8-10 weeks: progress overhead flex / ER (at 90/90). - 10-12 weeks: near-full symmetry (subtle deficits are normal). Strengthening and conditioning: - 6-8 weeks - - Resisted rows, shoulder extension. - Internal rotation band strengthening. - 8-10 weeks - - Progressed resisted rows, extensions, ER. - Light resisted internal rotation. - Resisted biceps and triceps. - Lower extremity strengthening (lunges, squats). Criteria for progression: - Time: 12 weeks post-op for healing. - 0-10 pain. - > 90% ROM symmetry. - 70% ER and IR strength symmetry. - 80% symmetry for ER and IR endurance test. Phase III - PLYOMETRICS AND POWER (12-20 Weeks): Goals: Introduce plyometrics and power movements, initiate throwing program, progressive strengthening. Range of Motion (ROM): - 12+ weeks: near-full symmetry (subtle deficits are normal). Strengthening and conditioning: - 12-16 weeks - - Initiate light dumbbell pressing. - Push-up progression (wall full). - Trampoline ball tosses. - 16-20 weeks - - Progressed resisted rows, extensions, ER. - Light resisted internal rotation. - Resisted biceps and triceps. Throwing and conditioning: - 16+ weeks: Initiate interval throwing program (MD approval). - 16-20+ weeks: Full LE strengthening, plyometric and agility. Criteria for progression: - 0/10 pain - ER and IR strength symmetry > 80% normal. - > 66% ER/IR strength ratio. - > 90% symmetry - ER and IR endurance test. - > 90% symmetry - seated shotput test. Phase IV - RETURN TO PLAY (20+ Weeks): Goals: Initiate sport-specific activities and return to play. Strengthening and conditioning: - 20+ weeks - - Plyo tosses double and single-arm, overhead tosses. - Closed chain strengthening. - Full gym workouts for biceps and triceps. Throwing and conditioning: - 16-20+ weeks: Full LE strengthening, plyometric and agility. - 20+ weeks: Initiate mound progression (MD approval). Recommended criteria for return to play: - 0/10 pain. - ER and IR strength symmetry > 90% normal. - > 66% ER/IR strength ratio. - > 95% symmetry - ER and IR endurance test. - > 95% symmetry - seated shotput test. - > 1 minute for upper extremity close kinetic chain stability test. - MD approval.
