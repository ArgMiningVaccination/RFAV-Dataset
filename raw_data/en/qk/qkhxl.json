Searches can be made of SciELO's existing collections covering the whole network or just a particular country. | | [ ]about this site SciELO Colombia seeks to improve Colombian scientific publications' quality and visibility and spread SciELO's methodology for electronic publications. A national programme has thus been developed for improving serialised publications and training courses re SciELO methodology. The site's object is to implement an electronic library providing complete access to collections of journals and the complete text of articles. Journals and articles can be accessed by using search indices and forms. The SciELO Colombia site forms part of the FAPESP/BIREME project aimed at applying methodologies which the project is currently developing. The Instituto de Salud P\u00fablica at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia has been instrumental in providing TIC resources for implementing the site. The site will be constantly updated both in form and content, according to the project's advancements. | | [ ]help On gaining access to the SciELO Colombia collection library, a user will find an interface presenting journals listed alphabetically by title, an index of materials, a key word search, the names of publishers, city of publication and material.
