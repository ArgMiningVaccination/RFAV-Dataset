Vaccines also keep us safe and are our best defense against diseases. They work with our body's natural defenses (our immune systems) to help us safely develop protection against disease, without the risks that come with being infected. Vaccines, like medicine, can have some side effects. The most common side effects are mild soreness, tiredness, redness, or swelling where you got the vaccine. Sometimes the vaccine will cause a mild fever. These side effects are caused as our immune systems learn how to fight the disease.
