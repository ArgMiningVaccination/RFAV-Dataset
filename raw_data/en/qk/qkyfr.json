As a yoga therapy practitioner positioned at the forefront of this emerging field, you will be able to design a fulfilling career and develop one-on-one therapeutic relationships in a wide variety of health, wellness, and conventional medical settings. MUIH's Master of Science Yoga Therapy program is the first and only accredited Master of Science degree in yoga therapy in the world. It offers a unique approach to this field by providing you with a comprehensive and highly experiential learning experience taught by globally renowned experts, culminating with a mentored clinical experience that prepares you to build or grow your practice. This 39.5-credit program is delivered in the online format and can be completed in 6 trimesters (2 years). The Master of Science in Yoga Therapy is designed for yoga teachers who want to progress in their career into the role of Yoga Therapist, so they can develop individualized yoga therapy plans of care for clients in one-one and small group settings. Students learn how to bridge the gap between ancient yoga wisdom and rigorous research practices, so they can partner with allied health professionals in supporting clients throughout their healthcare journey. In this two-year program, students develop their applied knowledge of the experiential sciences of yoga and yoga therapy and are mentored in their application of this knowledge in telehealth settings. The program is comprehensive in its approach, with an over-arching aim to equip tomorrow's yoga therapists with the ability to promote client biopsychosocial health and well-being through the applied practice of yoga therapy. Students who complete the program become eligible to sit for the national yoga therapy exam offered by the International Association of Yoga Therapists, to earn their C-IAYT designation. Are you already a licensed healthcare professional? Explore MUIH's [Post-Master's Certificate in Therapeutic Yoga Practices](https://muih.edu/academics/yoga-therapy/post-masters-certificate-in-therapeutic-yoga-practices/), designed specifically for licensed healthcare professionals. As the first and only Master of Science program in yoga therapy, MUIH's M.S. Yoga Therapy program prepares yoga therapists to thrive in a complex world. Students develop their applied yoga therapy skills through didactic (classroom) learning, clinic theatre training, peer-peer experiential learning, yoga therapy mentorship, and supervised yoga therapy practice. Students begin their studies with a full year of didactic study in the experiential science of yoga therapy, and then take a comprehensive exam to demonstrate their readiness to progress into work with clients in one-one and small group settings. In the second year of study, students are mentored by clinic faculty in the practice of yoga therapy in telehealth settings. Along the way, students are equipped with a comprehensive foundation in the theoretical, scientific, and experiential training of yoga therapy in one-one and small group settings. The curriculum is anchored in client-centered, compassionate, and culturally sensitive care, honoring all classical yoga traditions without attachment to a particular yoga lineage. Students learn how to apply their whole Self in the witnessing and assessment of each client's mind-body-heart-spirit system and story, and how to apply this wisdom and knowledge using scientific inquiry to design, delivery and evaluate comprehensive yoga therapy plans of care. Students learn how to tailor the philosophy, practices and postures of yoga to address individual health concerns; and to promote the benefits of yoga therapeutic practices and yoga therapy to multiple audiences (including future clients). The program provides a comprehensive understanding of the classical and theoretical foundations of the field of yoga therapy, as well as extensive knowledge of biomedical systems from an integrative and holistic perspective. Students study both yogic and behavior change theoretical frameworks and conceptual models, so they can develop their critical approach to integrating classical yogic wisdom into evidence-informed plans of care. The program also provides a strong foundation in the pathology of health and disease relevant to the practice of yoga therapy, and trains students how to design, deliver and evaluate yoga therapy plans of care for clients based on their health and well-being goals. MUIH yoga therapists learn best practices for working with clients remotely in the growing telehealth environment: how to hold space for clients as they share their lived experience; how to establish a client-practitioner relationship virtually; how to operate within HIPAA guidelines in the online environment; how to use electronic health records; and how to operate their private yoga therapy practice using telehealth delivery platforms. The telehealth clinic experience provides students with the opportunity to become comfortable with telehealth technology and practice skills that will support them in joining the integrative health workforce after graduation. Students are also taught how to establish and promote their yoga therapy private practice after graduation, using best practices in social-preneurship and online health promotion. As part of MUIH's commitment to advancing health equity, the program encourages yoga therapy students to engage with clients in remote, underserved, underrepresented, and socially disadvantaged settings. In this way, students build their cultural competency skills will making yoga therapy accessible to a wider, and less homogenous, audience. Students also learn how to engage effectively with wellness and healthcare providers, by developing their inter-professionality skills and their use of biomedical communication so they can collaborate with care teams and support clients in both community wellness and healthcare settings. Building on the success of ten years of providing yoga therapy training, MUIH's cohort-based program builds a strong community that continues long after graduation. MUIH graduates benefit from a strong alumni network, both inside of the yoga therapy program and across other MUIH integrative health programs, as well as continued career services support.

Interested individuals are encouraged to check for the most recent requirements. The Master of Science in Yoga Therapy is accredited by the International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT). For more information, visit: [www.iayt.org](http://www.iayt.org/). Eighty nine percent (89%) of recent graduates (2018-2021) of MUIH's M.S. Yoga Therapy program were employed or self-employed within one year of graduation. Graduates of MUIH's yoga therapy program are employed in a variety of settings including private practice; integrative group practices; health care systems; hospitals; U.S. military; veterans and military organizations and agencies; school systems; and colleges and universities. Many graduates chose to have a portfolio career in which they have multiple positions and employers within one or more profession, rather than one full-time job. A portfolio career provides such individuals with variety in their work life and the opportunity to develop a wide and varied professional network. The use of yoga in the U.S. continues to grow steadily leading to an increasing need for professionals trained in the field; individuals who complete the proposed program will be prepared to meet the growing expectations of the general public that yoga and meditation approaches be applied to support them. The 2017 National Health Interview Survey revealed significant increases in the use of yoga-based mind and body approaches. Yoga was the most commonly used complementary health approach among U.S. adults in 2012 (9.5%, 22.4 million individuals) and 2017 (14.3%, 35.2 million individuals) and demonstrated an increase in usage during that five-year period. The use of meditation increased more than threefold from 4.1% in 2012 to 14.2% in 2017. Similar increased usage of these modalities was observed in children aged 4-17 years. The percent of children who used yoga increased significantly from 3.1% in 2012 to 8.4% (4.9 million children) in 2017. The use of meditation among children also increased significantly from 0.6% in 2012 to 5.4% in 2017. The earlier 2016 Yoga in America Study conducted by Yoga Journal and Yoga Alliance also indicated significant and widespread use of yoga. 28% of all Americans had participated in a yoga class at some point in their lives. The number of Americans practicing yoga increased to over 36 million in 2016, up from 20.4 million in the 2012 study. There were more older practitioners than ever before; nearly 14 million practitioners were over the age of 50, up from about 4 million in 2012. One in three Americans had tried yoga on their own (not in a class) at least once. 34% of Americans said they were somewhat or very likely to practice yoga in the next 12 months, equal to more than 80 million Americans. Since 2012, the percentage of Americans aware of yoga grew from 75% to 90%. Healthcare bodies such as medicine's leading accreditor, The Joint Commission, the federal government's lnter-Agency Task Force on Pain Management, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the American College of Physicians, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend and, in some cases, require nonpharmacologic treatment as part of patient treatment planning. Yoga is among the key modalities cited for such non-pharmacologic approaches. The job market for yoga professionals is robust. The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics projects jobs for yoga professionals (included in BLS's fitness trainers and instructors category) to grow 19% from 2021-2031, much faster than average. There are currently 90,000 registered yoga teachers in the U.S. who possess the base level of non-academic training. MUIH's Master of Science in Yoga Therapy provides such individuals with the opportunity to differentiate and distinguish themselves from others and to their clients and potential employers.
