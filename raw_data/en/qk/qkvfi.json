The awakening process is a awe inspiring process, but can also come along with many physical, emotional, mental and spiritual challenges. I utilize many modalities to assist you, but always the goal is self-empowerment, freedom from fear and self-limiting beliefs, and a return to the pure state of divine Love and Light. I work from a place of both extensive training and deep personal experience, which allows me to treat you with humility, grace and wisdom. Distance sessions with me include discussion of any current life situations, then a portion of energy work (various modalities including New Paradigm MDT, Hawaiian Shaman work, and Arcturian light work), and spiritual guidance to help you grow on your soul's path. Sessions in-person with me may include acupuncture and herbal medicine. After sessions, the most common feedback is a feeling of empowerment, feeling lighter, freer and expanded in energy and awareness. Workshops with me are designed to lift you into your next level of expansion and awareness with grace and joy. My New Paradigm Multi-Dimensional Transformation workshops teach you to live a life of freedom from fear, to live in love without conditions and mastery. They teach you to work with the energies of Shamballa and the Ascended Masters, and with the energy of Mahatma pure divine Love and the Cosmic Heart. My various spiritual workshops are designed to self-empower you to learn that you have the ability to self-heal, to expand, and to use your own intuition and guidance. For those of you that are already practicing as healing facilitators of any kind, I offer workshops to increase your skills and abilities as a practitioner of the healing arts. I channel the energies of many enlightened beings (masters, ascended beings from other star systems, Archangel's, etc) and pass these through in my workshops and healing sessions, as well as teach others how to channel messages or energy from the Divine. I know that you know yourself better than I do. I am simply a guide to show you pieces of yourself, aspects of your soul or abilities that you may have hidden or forgotten that you have access to. But you do the inner work, and so you grow in your own confidence in your abilities to self-heal and self-expand. I look forward to assisting you in this magnificent journey of remembrance. Namaste, Kelly Kay KELLY KAY'S EDUCATION & TRAINING INCLUDES: Masters Degree in Traditional Oriental Medicine for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine, currently in school to receive her PhD Undergraduate Bachelor's of Science Degree with a major in Medical Microbiology and Immunology Additional Training in Japanese Meridian Therapy Style Acupuncture, which uses extremely light and gentle needling techniques for those that are needle sensitive or in a weaker state of health. Completed Foundational and Advanced Level Esoteric Acupuncture Training with Dr. Mikio Sankey. This style of acupuncture uses sacred geometry and treats the spiritual levels in addition to physical or emotional balancing. These treatments rapidly expand consciousness, creating energetic portals that you can leap through into your next level of awareness quickly and smoothly. The patterns can be done in-person with physical, thin acupuncture needles, or over a distance using energetic needles of light that pierce your energetic light body. Certified Practitioner and Instructor of the New Paradigm Multi-Dimensional Transformation Courses, Basic Master level and 13 Dimensional level. This is a registered program in the School of Esoteric Sciences in England. The program is about working with very high vibrational energies of love and wisdom to free people from limitations and allow their soul to ascend and operate from the higher dimensions, the 5th dimension and beyond. Completed Advanced Level Hawaiian Huna Shaman Training with Serge Kahili King on The Big Island of Hawaii. These techniques include many well known shamanic techniques such as meeting with power animals, journeying, soul retrieval, and transformation of difficult life events using visualization and energy techniques. These are performed through the eyes of the traditional Hawaiian culture which emphasizes Aloha (living with reverence and love to all beings), that the world is what you believe it to be, that there are no limits and all energy is in the now moment and within you. Training in Arcturian Light Healing Techniques as taught by Dr. Gene Ang. The Arcturians are higher dimensional beings that specialize in healing the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual bodies using light technology, vortexes and light language symbols. Training in DNA Activations. Our DNA is shifting as our consciousness shifts, returning to the full 12-strand system that we had during Lemurian and Atlantean times. Much of what scientists consider 'junk' DNA is actually quantum DNA that connects us to our multi- dimensional nature (past and future lifetimes, ability to connect our consciousness to beings across the universe, intuitive abilities, self-healing abilities, etc.). Kelly is trained to energetically assist your DNA to activate to its fullest potential, as well releasing/removing codes that limit you or your health. Kelly utilizes energy, sound and light codes to perform these "}
