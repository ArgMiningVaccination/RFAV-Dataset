These companies only sell their products to select vendors who value the extensive processes they take to ensure the quality and validity of their ingredients and product labelling. Our Doctors of Chiropractic at The Winchester Institute of Chiropractic Health and Wellness do not advocate for the purchase of over-the-counter vitamins and supplements due to their safety and quality concerns. The Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) in the United States does little to no testing on vitamins and supplements to ensure the safety of the consumer. The FDA labels vitamins and supplements as food products rather than medicine which results in limited regulation on these items. This allows major companies to use low quality ingredients and manufacturing processes without being inspected unless there is credible proof of damage. Overall, there is a significant link between the lack of regulation and low-quality products. Our Chiropractors at The Winchester Institute of Chiropractic Health and Wellness use a Systems Survey form to assess which vitamins and supplements will best cater your needs. The Systems Survey is a questionnaire that asks you about your symptoms and how they connect to your body's organs and glands. While a single symptom provides little information, a pattern of symptoms might reveal underlying health problems.
