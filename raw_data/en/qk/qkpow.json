COVER STORY COVID-19 has been around for at least six months now, surging across the globe. After all this time, are we any closer to containing the pandemic? Are there multiple strains, with the less virulent ones responsible for fewer deaths in India? Have lockdowns succeeded in controlling the pandemic? Why have certain countries managed to contain the virus where others have failed? And most importantly, what must we do next? We explore the treatments under consideration, the latest research on the virus, the probability of a vaccine's development and the way forward.

U (SW)-34/2017-19 ; Published on July to 6.00 PM Saturday 10.00 AM to OFFICE Tiger Blows Fire NAINITAL Vipul Pande: This refers to the cover story Can India Become China 2.0? (June 15). The pandemic has disrupted the supply chains of many goods originating from China. This has made countries realise that overdepend-ence on China isn't prudent. Moreover, there is Beijing's opaque, stubborn and aggressive attitude to contend with. With countries, especially those that do not toe its line, wary of China's increasing clout, oppor - tunities have opened up for India. Its posi- tive image and vast market can draw big companies to its shores. However, this entails a lot of spadework to create an inves-tor-friendly atmosphere. Cocooning Indian manufacturers in the name of self-depend- ence isn't the right way forward. Let them compete on a level playing field. BANGALORE H.N. Ramakrishna: India and China share one of the world's longest land borders and there have been several conflicts. In 1962, China attacked India while ostensibly pro- fessing the motto 'Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai'. The present flare-up cannot be viewed in isolation\u2014it is part of China's quest for hegemony. Similar incidents are occurring in the South China Sea, Senkaku Islands and the Taiwan Strait. China does not hesitate to weaponise trade. It plays by its own set of rules, whether in the domain of trade practices or territorial disputes. Its message to neighbouring nations: do not support USA in the US-China standoff. Many might consider its economic strength a positive, but the country's rise as a global power is not making it popular with its neighbours. China should not overlook the fact that in the event of a cold or trade war with USA, it will need support from its Asian neighbours, including its major trading partner India. More alterca-tions are likely, but fortunately, communication channels between the two countries have been and, hopefully, will remain open and strong. NAVI MUMBAI C.K. Subramaniam: It is evi- dent that China is not comfort-able with India's strengthened infrastructure along the border. As a sovereign nation, India is within its rights to take aggres-sive steps. Unfortunately, the government has not thought it fit to take the nation into confi-dence or share the ground real-ity. This may lead to spiralling mis in format ion. While the gov -ernment is not expected to dis-close all its plans for security considerations, as an elected democratic government, it is obliged to tell the nation about the extent of incursions by the Chinese army. It is time to take citizens and the Opposition into confidence. CHENNAI K.R. Narasimhan: India and China should fight COVID-19 rather than indulge in brink - manship across the LAC. At a time when India is facing a sig-nificant increase in cases and there are fears that a second wave could engulf China, bor - der clashes are uncalled for. But the timing of the border incidents comes on the heels of India's decision to clamp down on Chinese FDI invest- ments and encourage Western and Japanese companies to shift their production bases away from China. India also supports Taiwan's participa- tion in the WHO as an observer. Despite the PLA's incursions, India's infrastruc- ture upgradation close to the LAC will continue. This has irked China to no end. Softening its stand, Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong said that China and India pose no threat to each other. While India has shown a willingness to confront China to safeguard its territorial interests, it should also try to diffuse the standoff through talks. Hunger Games DEHRADUN Rakesh Agrawal: This refers to What After Home? (June 8). Terming the workers forced to return to their homes as mig- rants is rubbing salt on their bleeding wounds. Is any doctor, engineer, software profes- sional, poet, writer, actor or politician branded a migrant? If so, the entire Bollywood fra- ternity and almost every politi- cian and bureaucrat in Delhi and state capitals would be a migrant. We, the people of India, the city-based, urbane middle-class professionals and elites, have failed the workers who built our dream worlds.

MUMBAI M.R. Jayanthi: The overnight declaration of lockdown to combat the spread of COVID- 19 has harmed people and the economy. The country has not healed from the wounds of demonetisation, yet the government has pummelled it further. The Centre should have been considerate and stra-tegic; it should have scheduled consultations with experts and stakeholders. The proverb 'haste makes waste' has come true with the sudden declara-tion of the lockdown. Brainstorming is vital for any decision to be effective and successful. MARUTHANCODE G. David Milton: The Supreme Court's belated order to provide free food, water and transport to migrant workers appears to have been passed to atone for its initial refusal to intervene to sec ure their welfare. The apex court could have crowned itself with greater glory by taking the desperate plight of migrant workers far more seriously at the beginning of the crisis its-elf. The country's top court took an unforgivably long time to take note of their mis-ery and ask the government to provide succour. Even now, there seems to be no end to the suffering of migrant work - ers. Tragic deaths due to hunger, heat, dehydration and exhaus-tion continue to occur due to the government's ill-disguised apathy bordering on callous-ness. Of particular poignancy was the image of a child trying to wake up his dead mother at a railway station. Running of Shramik Specials looks like tok - enism when it falls far short of the requirement to ferry lakhs of migrant workers. It is not that the Indian state is incapable of ensuring the safe return of workers to their native places, but it has been unwilling to rec- ognise the value of their lives. FROM THE Daak Room Dear Ruth, I have some more very bad news to write. I guess if things keep on like this, by the end of the year, there will be nobody left in town. Harold Ashley died yesterday at Camp Wilton(?) and his body is to be brought to Middleboro as soon as the government can get things straightened out. As things are, I can give you no further infor - mation about the funeral, only that in Massachusetts, no public funerals or any other gathering can be held. Schools, churches, lodges, clubs, book rooms etc are closed down tight. All Red Cross workstations are suspended and they have cut out some of the electric car trips as so many men are sick. Just as soon as I hear any more about Harold's funeral, I will let you know. I will also look out for the flowers. I was intending to write on Saturday, but Captain Doten told me that Harold was improving, so I thought I would be able to give you some good news... but about 8 pm today Harold Doten came up to the house on his motorcy- cle and told me the sad news. He also said that Mel Shurtleff died at Camp Devens yesterday at almost the same time as Harold. Yesterday I worked around the yard all day, get- ting things cleaned up so that I could... then rest this morning, I filled one barrel with Baldwins so that we might have a few in case we had a high wind. On Friday we had seven funerals and Saturday about as many so you see what we are up against. In Brockton, three days last week, there was one every hour. I am glad that you are having so good a time and that you can be on vacation even if I can't get one as things are very rushing at present. Last Friday I went to work at 8 am and quit at 8:30 pm with just one half hour out for supper. For dinner, I had two sandwiches so you can imagine what we are up against. I am sending you the OLD COLONY and the Middleboro paper and also a card which came from Abington. If I find it is all right for you to go to the funeral, I will telephone you, but do not go unless I do for at this time it doesn't pay to take any chances. I hope you have written to Harry's mother explaining the circumstances, for I should feel rather cheap if I should happen to meet any of them and not have them understand just how things were. Captain Doten was just in and told me to tell you not to think of coming as Harold will be buried just as soon as his body arrives and there will be no funeral. Dr. Jackson's wife is very ill. Hoping you will not catch anything and that you are still getting better with the... With Love, Chick....Plymouth, Massachusetts, September 30, 1918 Bad News A letter written by a man in Plymouth, USA, during the Spanish fluMUMBAI Ramani C.K. Jayanthi: This refers to Thank You, Nurse (May 4). Nurses from Kerala, who form the backbone of almost every hos-pital in Mumbai, have left in droves, crippling operations at sev - eral major hospi- tals. The contribution of Kerala in the medical field is com-mendable. In Mumbai as well as other parts of the world, nurses from Kerala are a com- mon sight. Nurses are the most important pillars of the medi-cal fraternity\u2014abroad, they are one rung below doctors, but in India, they are not accorded much respect. Nurses are vital for healthcare and should be compensated with high salaries and more time-off. MUMBAI Bholey Bhardwaj: This refers to The Abusage Of Rhetoric (June 8). It's not a coincidence that Nepal woke up to redraw its map and claim Indian terri-tories\u2014it's a well-thought plan to upstage India at China's behest. Nepal is culturally and geographically aligned with India. It could never have mus-tered the courage to make an issue out of border roads with- out China's clandestine support. India will do well to placate Nepal and increase it's presence there, for ignoring it may push the Himalayan nation into China's fold. JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 5Puneet Nicholas Yadav MADHYA Pradesh health minister Narottam Mishra is a busy man these days. His schedule, however, isn't packed with matters linked to the steadily rising coronavirus infections in MP . Instead, it is the health of the BJP government that has taken primacy for Mishra. While the state has been adding nearly 200 new COVID-19 cases daily, the health minister has been trying to pacify BJP veterans still sulking over the induction of Jyotiraditya Scindia's loyalists into the party in March. Mishra was among the five ministers inducted by Chouhan into his mini- cabinet on April 21, nearly a month after the BJP returned to power in the state following a 15-month hiatus. Mishra's efforts comes at a time when chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been struggling to finalise his cabinet expansion plan while also preparing for 24 assembly bypolls. The bypolls\u201416 of them within the Gwalior-Chambal region\u2014have been necessitated because of the defection of former Congress MLAs loyal to Scindia who switched to the BJP , making way for Chouhan's return as CM by toppling the Congress-led Kamal Nath government. Sources say Chouhan had finalised a blueprint for cabinet expansion recently after discussions with state BJP president V.D. Sharma, party leaders Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Suhas Bhagat and some ministerial hopefuls. The plan was \"put on hold by the Heartland Heartburn Runaway Covid, sulking loyals...MP BJP also has Scindia playing hardballTHENEWS central leadership because several senior MLAs were unhappy after being informed that they may not find a place in the cabinet because Scindia's men have to be accommodated,\" a BJP leader says. Senior BJP MLAs feel that Scindia's men would be favoured above them for cabinet berths and that party veterans who lost the December 2018 assembly polls against these newcomers may be permanently elbowed out of electoral politics. BJP veteran and Chouhan's former cabinet colleague, Gauri Shanker Shejwar says, \"The BJP used to value its karyakarta but now those who have fickle loyalties get rewarded.\" Chouhan's five-member cabinet has two ministers who are Scindia loyalists. Sources say Scindia wants at least four more cabinet berths for his men in the upcoming cabinet expansion. A section of BJP leaders, however, wants the induction of these former MLAs made incumbent on their ability to win the bypolls. Amid this confusion, rumours that Chouhan may go for another mini- cabinet expansion instead of an extensive one have begun to gain currency in Bhopal. This, say BJP insiders, would give Chouhan more time to broker peace between old warhorses and Scindia. Mishra, who played a key role in the defection of Scindia and his loyalists, has been tasked with playing peacemaker between party veterans from the Gwalior region and Scindia.

But the elephant is an acutely sensitive and gentle animal that follows rigidly atavistic social norms. The whole herd celebrates a newborn calf; when a male reaches reproductive age, it is pushed away from the herd by matriarchs to avoid inbreeding\u2014elephant society is one of the most evolved in nature. Along with its majesticity, it is celebrated as such too\u2014in traditional tales in the Pan- chatantra and the Jatakas it's held up as a creature imbued with wisdom; as a rare animal which sheds tears, like us, from emotional distress (elephants experience post-traumatic stress dis- order like humans from trauma), it's perhaps a natural choice for ancient, and modern-day, anthropomorphism. Thus, the outpouring of national grief WILDLIFE\"Elephants travel hundreds of kilometers through fixed corridors for food. As railway lines, roads, canals, high-tension wires, and quarries disrupt these, what will the stressed animals do?\" says WSO's Biswajit Mohanty. They have little choice but to venture into villages and raid farms, leading to man-animal conflicts. Elephants have killed over 2,300 humans between 2014 and 2019. The destruction of ele- phant corridors is a chief reason lead- ing to deaths. But who is to be blamed? The government, largely. The ministry of environment last year gave clearance for mining in 1,70,000 hectares of pris-tine Hasdeo Arand forests in Chhattis-garh. They include elephant corridors. The National Board of Wildlife recently allowed Coal India Limited to conduct open cast mining in an addi-tional 41 hectares of the Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve in Assam. While wild elephants (about 27,000) face disruptions, the lot of those in cap-tivity is worse. Captive elephants in India number between 2,600 and 3,000\u2014used for temples, tourist rides, even for wedding processions. To sub- due and train young elephants, mahouts subject them to great pain. The situa-tion of tuskers is no better in temples. How does this happen when the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, gives elephants the highest protection? Ownership certificates, initially permitted by the Act for those already in possession of elephants, have continued, owing to poor enforcement of the law. Oversight has led to a trafficking of sorts. \"At times, young elephants are caught in the Northeast and sent to temples in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. The owners claim they are unable to take care of them and are giv - ing them away. Something does not seem right here,\" says Suparna Ganguly, co-founder of Wildlife Research and Rehabilitation Centre. India, certainly, is no country for elephants. OEfforts under way to retrieve the body of the pregnant elephant which died in Kerala's Palakkad over the death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala's Palakkad is natural. Yet, in the same week, two more elephants would have died a death as painful somewhere else in India. According to government data, an average of 102 elephants died unnatural deaths every year between 2014 and 2019. Consider this: a train mowed down five elephants in Assam's Hojai in February 2018. That year, seven elephants were electrocuted by a high-tension wire in Odisha's Dhenkanal. The Wildlife Society of Odisha says about 100 elephants were killed in accidents during 2018-19 in Odisha alone! The Wildlife Protection Act 1972, which protects elephants too, is poorly enforced.

Speaking at the daily government briefing on the coronavirus pandemic on April 28, Hemant Sharma, principal secretary of the industries department and head of the \"emergency procurement commit-tee for COVID-19\", said chief minister Patnaik had given a 'blank cheque' to buy and stock on everything needed to fight the contagion. After two cases in the Orissa High Court, an FIR by RTI activists and removal of Sharma from the committee, the 'blank cheque' is haunting the government. Tell-tale signs of corruption in the purchase of PPE kits, masks and test kits keep tumbling out. The crux of the allegations so far is this: the state government ordered 30 lakh triple-layered masks priced at Rs 16 apiece from a Tamil Nadu-based firm on April 17 in what was a clear violation of the Centre's guidelines, which pegged the maximum price at Rs 10 apiece. Curiously, the state placed orders for the same kind of masks to a Faridabad based company at Rs 9.90 apiece barely ODISHA 48 hours ago on April 15. As if that was not enough, there were wide variances in the procurement price of test kits, which were procured from three differ - ent firms at prices varying from Rs 980 to Rs 1, 125 within a short time\u2014 between April 21 and May 10. RT-PCR machines, which cost Rs 4 lakh to Rs 5 lakh were bought at Rs 12.84 lakh. With the Opposition turning on the heat and activists constantly breathing down its neck every day, the state gov - ernment on June 5 removed Hemant Sharma as head of the \"COVID-19 pur - chase committee\". In another firefighting measure later in the day, the government also divested nine senior IAS officials of their addi- tional pandemic responsibilities. But the government's hurried action has failed to douse the fires as the accu- sations have only turned shrill in the days since then. The Nationalist Lawyers' Forum filed a writ petition in the Orissa High Court seeking a CBI inquiry into the scam. State Congress unit chief Niranjan Patnaik said the opposition party would move both the central vigilance commission (CVC) and the Lokayukta seeking high-level inves-tigation into the \"scam\". The financial scandal appears to have taken the sheen out of the state govern-ment's otherwise stellar record in fight-ing and containing the coronavirus.

To end the pandemic, women in several districts of Bihar are making offerings to the Devi at waterbodies\u2014rituals generally associated with the Chhatth festival and sun god. Quite apt, we think, considering the sun has a corona too. A woman at Sarveshwarnath Temple in Brahmapura, Muzaffar - pur, says she realised that the disease could only be eradicated with offerings of laddoos, sesame seeds and flowers after \"watching a video\". Another learnt of it in a dream. It's too early to say what the Devi thinks of her followers' oblations presented with adequate social distancing, but COVID-19 cases have been rising steadily in Bihar.

However, in case of an Emergency, the elections can be deferred for one year, plus six months after the Emergency is lifted. Former CEC S.Y.

According to Quraishi, holding elec- tions in Bihar may be a daunting task, but not impossible. \"After all, South Korea held its parliamentary polls amid the coronavirus pandemic and VOTE/ COVID Bhavna Vij-Aurora HOME minister Amit Shah spoke about Bihar's journey from the \"lantern to LED\" as he addressed the people of the state at a virtual rally on June 7. The BJP tried to make it look as real as possible by creating a rally-like atmosphere at the party headquarters in Delhi, giving a peek into what post-COVID-19 election-eering is going to be like. And Bihar is going to be the first big election following the outbreak of the pandemic in India. Top government sources say postpone-ment of the Bihar elections is the last thing they would want. The assembly elections, which must be concluded by November 29, are likely to take place as per schedule in October-November and will be the trendsetter for a new kind of electoral democracy. Though various options of virtual and e-voting are being discussed, they are all in the nascent stage yet. Accord-ing to sources, the elections will by and large see voting in the traditional man-ner, though people will have to main-tain social distancing norms while queuing up at polling booths. Virtual voting may be tried in a few assembly seats as a test case. Declining to give details of the \"baby steps\" taken towards digitisation of voting, chief election commissioner Sunil Arora says, \"We are working on blockchain solutions to enable remote voting. The Technical Experts Committee (TEC) of the Election Commission of India (ECI) is working to develop a block - chain system that would allow voters to exercise their votes when they are physically away from their constitu-ency.\" The TEC comprises experts from IITs across the country. The ECI is holding an exhaustive meeting on June 15 to discuss the way forward. \"CEC Arora has always reiter - A hybrid model of e-election and regular voting could be tried out in the Bihar elections.Social distancing at booths, virtual or e-voting, postal votes\u2014 polls in Bihar may herald era of post-COVID electioneering.

The ECI is studying the South Korean model and I am sure India will do bet- ter than that,\" he adds. Bihar's popula- tion of 9.9 crore is, however, much big-ger than South Korea's 5.16 crore. The sheer logistics involved in holding elections in Bihar at such a time are intimidating, says an official. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the total number of polling booths in Bihar was 72,227. Each booth ideally caters to 1,200 to 1,500 voters, which can turn out to be a nightmare for social distanc-ing. The ECI is in the process of figuring out the ideal number of voters per poll-ing booth. \"If we allow only 500 voters per booth, we need 70,000 more offi- cials to man the increased number of booths,\" says the official. \"And if we decide to have 800 voters per booth, we need 51,000 additional officials. We are working on all these issues.\" Each booth needs at least six officials to man it\u2014first polling officer, second polling officer, third polling officer, presiding officer, micro observer and digital cam- era person. The role of each is well-def-ined and cannot be curtailed. There are no easy solutions. IIT-Bhilai director Prof Rajat Moona, who is part of the ECI's TEC, says they have been working on the possibility of remote vot-ing for some time. Referring to a 2015 conference where this issue was dis- cussed, he says the electronically trans- mitted postal ballot system was initiated as an outcome\u2014for people using postal ballot, like those in the armed forces and other services. In this, the ballot paper is transmitted to the voters through an electronic mechanism. The PDF file is then downloaded by them, a print taken and the vote cast. It is then mailed back through the normal postal system. There is no system in place yet to send the bal-lot back electronically. Centre for Digital Economy Policy Research president Dr Jaijit Bhattacha- rya says holding e-elections with the current infrastructure is extremely chal-lenging. \"People need to have their e-signs and it is far-fetched as of now. Penetration of smart devices is still not deep in India. Enormous amount of training and system build-up is needed before we move towards e-elections,\" he says. There is also the need to devise a way to maintain the secrecy of the ballot as e-signs or digital signatures could give come. Political leaders say their cam-paign strategies will also see a big shift. \"Crowded rallies will be a thing of past, replaced by virtual ones. There will be an increased focus on digital canvassing and more personalised micro ground-level contact with the voters. There will also be a return of handbills and pam-phlets,\" says BJP general secretary Bhu- pendra Yadav. The parties are also taking a relook at the issues they generally raise before every election\u2014those of caste and reli- gious identity. They may not work any - more as delivery of welfare measures and livelihood issues are likely to take centre stage in the post-COVID-19 scenario. \"The fear of disease has united the people in broader terms. There is also anger among the migrants regarding their struggle to reach their homes, and at the misman- agement by the authorities. There will be a political fallout,\" says political analyst Manisha Priyam. Whether LED has replaced the lantern or not, more important in the coming elec- tions would be whether the political parties keep their promises. Oaway the identity of the voter. Bhattacharya believes a hybrid model of e-election and regular voting could be tried out in the forthcoming elec- tions in Bihar as the ECI is contemplat-ing. Quraishi agrees it can be tried out in a few assemblies, but adds that these should selected by the draw of lots. He adds that it is important to demonstrate that the technology used is hack-proof. Bhattacharya says technology, when deployed on a large scale, needs to be tested out for both its technical robust- ness and its social acceptance, especially for sensitive applications like elections. \"We should start moving towards e-elec-tions as it would also reduce the cost of conducting polls,\" he adds. The 2019 Lok Sabha elections had cost the ECI Rs 6,500 crore\u2014Rs 72 per voter. While holding digital elections may reduce the cost manifold, political par - ties are hoping there will be a major reduction in their campaigning costs in the Bihar polls, and then in the elections in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, due in the first half of 2021. They anticipate that social distancing norms are here to stay for some elections to Rallies will be replaced by virtual ones. Focus will be on digital canvassing, says BJP's Bhupendra Yadav.

The Farmers' Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance provided for the creation of an ecosystem to promote efficient, transparent and barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade and commerce of farmers' produce outside the physical premises. It also provides a facilita-tive framework for electronic trading and transactions platform for trade. Trade and commerce ordinance does not require state authority as state gov - ernments will continue to have control over APMC Acts and their efficacy has been protected except when it pertains to trade area. The Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assur - ance & Farm Services Ordinance provide for framework for farmers to engage with agri-business firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for farm services and sale of farmers produce. Opening of agriculture markets will lead to greater choice and price competition, allowing farmers to seek the best price for their produce. This will ensure higher income to farm- ers, a part of which is expected to result in improved investment in better agricultural practices resulting in higher productivity. Marketing avenues will open up and result in higher private sector investment in supply chains. Another aspect of the new initiatives is that they will help in unfolding funding facility, announced as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package, to the tune of Rs 1 lakh crore for creating post-harvest man- agement infrastructure, including e-mar - keting points with the active partnership of states. As farmers get better prices and opportunities of employment grow in rural areas due to investment in agricul- ture related infrastructure, the role of states will gain prominence. The pres- ent system of MSP for various agri produce shall continue. It is a support price mechanism, announced before the cropping season. The farmers shall now have additional options apart from mandis and MSP centres. Substantial increase of area under farming agreements is expected. The reforms are expected to protect farmers as informal agreements will shift to formal agreements. The farming agreements for sale of future farm produce at predictable and remunerative price can be adopted at a large scale only if there is a conducive and uniform policy framework in the country. Under the ordinance, the farmer is safeguarded against price volatility, as the purchase price of the farm produce is to be determined and mentioned in the farming agreement. In case price is subject to variation, the farming agreement will explicitly provide for guaranteed price to be paid and addi- tional amount as premium and bonus over and above the guaranteed price based on the pre-determined price reference. Farmers entering into farming agreements will be safeguarded as the ordi- nance prohibits acquiring of land ownership by the sponsor and also not allowing the sponsor to construct any permanent structure on farmers' land. Accessible, quick and cost-effective dispute mechanism have also been pro- vided to safeguard the interest of the farmers. O (Views are personal) OPINION/ Sanjay Agarwal promulgation of three ordi- nances, undertaken to push through holistic agriculture reforms, will provide free- dom of choice to both farmers and buy - ers to sell and buy across the country and that too without licensing barriers for better price realisation for the farm- ers. The Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) Act has geograph- ical restrictions as the farmers can sell their scheduled market surplus only at fixed market places, which can be either the markets operated by market com-mittees or private markets or warehous-ing, cold storages, silos declared as deemed markets or the notified places of direct marketing licensee. In these places also the purchase is by licensed trader. The licensed buyer on the other hand is free to sell to anyone anywhere. These constraints hindering the devel- opment of \"one nation one market\" for agricultural produce shall be removed. The new reforms will not only create competition but will also make the APMCs more efficient. The holistic approach to reforms will also encourage investment in developing value chain infrastructure by new investors in the states due to a liberalised atmosphere. This will eventually lead to value addi- tion, reduction in post-harvest losses, improvement in agriculture share in GDP leading to more rural employment, thus ultimately motivating states to come on board to support the consoli- dated measures. Thus, the ordinances will potentially enhance production and productivity by facilitating competitive pricing for farmers' produce due to more choice of buyers. The greater freedom and choice to both farmers and buyers will open up multiple channels of buy - ing-selling like physical trade and e-trade under this ordinance, in addi- tion to options to sell in the market yards notified under the APMC Act. Thus, in days to come, there will be a THETHE AUTHOR IS SECRETARY, AGRICULTURE MINISTRY Seeds of a Revolution The government's intervention in the agriculture sector is expected to help farmers take control of their destinies The reforms are expected to protect farmers as informal agreements will shift to formal agreements.About two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion population is engaged in agriculture. Out of those, more than 85% come under the category of small and marginalized farmers, or simply put, those with less than two hectares of land. This huge section of the village population finds itself in a very volatile economy. The reasons are their limited resources, dependence on erratic monsoons, and agriculture being vulnerable to adverse effects of climate change. In such a situation, protection of these small farmers is a pressing challenge. That's where an intervention called the Infrastructure for Climate Resilient Growth (ICRG) comes in. It emerged in 2016 from collaboration between the UK Government and the Ministry of Rural Development in India. One of the central objectives of ICRG is to embed climate resilient strategies in the implementation of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNERGA) - the world's largest social protection scheme. Any person in a village can seek work under MGNREGA and has a guarantee of 100 days of work in a year. The work involves light manual labour and the daily wages are roughly around Rs 200. It's not seen as a source of primary income but certainly as an important source of supplementary income, especially for women who can't go out of the villages for work owing to a number of social reasons. With migrant labourers working in cities returning to their villages due to covid-19 lockdown, the reliance on MGNREGA for succour has risen steeply in villages. As per the latest figures, there are 120 million active workers under the scheme. The ICRG has always been committed to making interventions at the very grassroots. In the same spirit, it tries to make the works under MGNREGA more in line with climate-resilient practices. The works in the employment scheme are usually related to irrigation, plantations, ground water recharge, and soil conservation. A driving idea behind ICRG is to take climate science to district, block and village levels. So far, it has been implemented in 103 blocks across 22 districts of Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The initiative has benefited approximately 1.8 million people in these three states. Furthermore, ICRG helps farmers make informed decisions about crop choices in view of climate change. So it's providing knowhow on climate-resilient practices to not just MGNREGA works but also farming. Awareness about rights is another focus area of ICRG. That, teamed up with climate knowledge, empowers the village representatives to negotiate with district administration on fund disbursal, and channel it towards a more climate-conscious form of development. This joint UK-India initiative has not only helped rural development but also made it more sustainable and enduring vis-\u00e0-vis climate change. The initiative has provided a way for vulnerable communities to secure their livelihoods, along with learning to guard themselves from the onslaught of climate change. World Environment Day is the perfect timing to acknowledge the importance of global cooperation and the power of countries joining hands to act as a force for good .

The two spoke on the phone recently. Turkish support for the UN-backed regime in Tripoli managed to marginalise renegade general Khalifa Haftar's force, backed by Russia. Moscow says it will work for peace in Libya with Erdogan.NORTH KOREA The nation threat - ened to cut off all communication lines with South Korea, including the hot line between the two nations' leaders. The North said this was the first in a series of actions against the \"enemy\". The two nations are officially at war. But the cur - rent move is seen as North's attempt to get more concessions from the South. SANS FRONTIERS IRAN and Venezuela, two adversaries of the US, both subject to American sanctions, came together in an act of defiance to violate the terms being set by the Donald Trump administration. The Islamic Republic leadership in Tehran undertook a risky mission when it decided to send five tankers carrying oil through some of the world's most crucial maritime gateways to cash-strapped Venezuela, which suffers from acute shortage of refined oil, despite having the world's largest oil reserves. Through its action Iran wanted to send a message to the US that Tehran was determined to challenge American policies aggressively. The mission was accomplished last weekend when the last of the five tankers reached their destination. Despite its large military presence in the Caribbean waters, the US did not intervene; the revolutionary socialist government of Nicolas Maduro got its much-needed cargo. As motorists lined up to fill their tanks, Maduro declared that he would soon visit Tehran to sign more agreements and thank the people of Iran. US sanctions on Iran's oil sales have throttled its crude exports. Anyone buying Iranian goods risks punitive measures from Washington. Venezuela is also under US sanctions. \"Our policy towards the US has changed from a defensive to an offensive approach,\" an Iranian regime insider told Financial Times. \"The US sent us messages through two regional states that 'we will hit your tankers if you proceed'. Our answer was clear: If you hit us, we'll hit back.\" In the last stage of their journey, Venezuela, which had warned that any US efforts to stop the convoy would be an act of war, sent jets and the navy to escort the tankers. For Iranian leaders, given the risks and transport costs, the transaction made little economic sense. In total, they earned at most $50m, probably paid in gold to bypass sanctions. The five tankers carried 1.5m barrels. But, for the regime, the show of strength justified the risks. Iran has stood firm in its encounters with the US and Britain. When British marines seized an Iranian tanker in Gibraltar, Iran impounded a British-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz. The Iranian tanker was later released. It also shot down a US drone last year. After the US killed Iran's revered military commander, Qassem Soleimani, in Iraq in January, Iran launched missiles against a US base in Iraq. A western diplomat observed that despite a huge rise in inflation and unemployment, the republic was showing no desire to change course. \"The US knows its sanctions will not pay off,\" said the diplomat.

His discoveries on Vitamin C, the Krebs cycle and how our muscles function are part of text- books of biochemistry. He once wrote how, in his search for a picture of life, the torch-light slipped over the very edge of being: \"I started with anatomy, then shifted to function, to physiology, and studied rabbits. But then I found rabbits too complicated and shifted to bacteriology...later I found bacte- ria too complicated and shifted to molecules and began to study chemistry.... I ended with electrons which have no life at all\u2014molecules have no life\u2014so life ran out between my fingers actually while I was studying it, trying to find it...\" Szent-Gyorgyi was not alone in this. The boundary that separates the non-living from the living\u2014that mysterious cusp\u2014is a real one, but trying to put that knife-edge under a microscope can actually impede understanding life on this blue planet. Take the most abundant biological entities of nature\u2014viruses. The sheer number and diversity of viruses easily dwarfs humans, our crops and domesticated cattle, the billions of insects teeming in the tropical forests, even the microscopic organisms abundant in any river. A litre of sea- water may contain a hundred billion viruses of few thousand different kinds! They occur in millions in the lungs and intestines of healthy people. They are present deep below the Antarctic surface, in the subterranean caves of Mexico, on the scorched sand dunes of African deserts, and in almost every living species scientists have studied. They control the growth of bacterial populations, play vital roles in the mega geochemical cycles that make up our environment and can, of course, evolve\u2014jumping from one host species to another, as we now are only too keenly aware. It's no wonder that Carl Zimmer referred to the Earth as \"a planet of viruses\". The present global crisis brought on by Covid-19\u2014directly linked to rampant deforestation and illegal animal trade\u2014is a result of our unbridled and greedy misadventures into virosphere. Yet, viruses are not exactly 'alive' in the sense cellular organisms are. The latter are made up of one or many cells. Indeed, many of them, like ourselves, form large, organised cellular associations\u2014a body. The bodies move, eat, fight, take in resources to build their cells and, in time, mate with other bodies to make more cellular entities like themselves\u2014the next generation. The instructions for doing all this is encoded in a long chain-like polymer(s), called DNA, present within the cells. The DNA is a manual, a blueprint; different links in the chain\u2014genes\u2014carry the information for making different proteins. Following those commands embedded in the DNA, the rest of the cell makes proteins. In turn, the proteins (like insulin, antibodies, enzymes and collagen) join hands to do all the physiological work, finally leading to reproduc-tion and thus ensuring that there are more copies of that body and the DNA within. It's teamwork between the cell's DNA and protein-making apparatus. Viruses do the same but they have found a shortcut. They do carry DNA (or RNA, a related molecule), but, being so tiny, there's no space for the protein-making apparatus. There's no need either: when a virus infects a cell, it hijacks the latter's protein-producing factories, captures the depots of nutrients and commands the cell to make only multiple copies of viral proteins and viral DNA! Thus, although they carry only a part of the ingredients essential for life, viruses are intracellular parasites that evolve and flourish in the foggy zone that demarcates the living from the inanimate. How viruses evolved this 'hijack strategy' is an enduring mystery. The fact that prehistoric viruses have not left fos- sils has not helped either. But today, there's a wealth of knowledge that take us to the very origins of life. Notably, even within present-day cells, some RNA mol-ecules can store genetic information (like DNA does) as well as catalyse biochemi- cal reactions (like proteins do). This is an indicator that at the very dawn of life, in the hot, anoxic oceans of the primordial world, simple chemicals formed bonds resulting in complex molecules and some of them, in turn, gained the chemical \"Stunning as it may seem, the DNA in our chromosomes is peppered with sequences that once belonged to active viruses.\" MERS virus20 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020Thus, no more only parasites, viruses now answer to that proverb\u2014\"an enemy's enemy is a friend\"! The utility of viruses does not stop there. Rather, their perennial arms- race with bacterial cells is the source of what are called restriction enzymes and CRISPR-Cas, sets of bacterial pro-teins without which many of the applications of modern biotechnology would be impossible. There are others who are less friendly, of course\u2014for example, the malignancy-inducing Papillomavirus and Hepatitis B viruses. But, humankind's association with viruses goes way beyond diseases and modern technology. Stunning as it may seem, the DNA in our chromosomes is peppered with sequences that once belonged to active viruses. Called Endogeneous Retroviruses, these relics of past encounters make up more than 8 per cent of our genomic space\u2014a colossal number when you consider that our protein-encoding sequences take up hardly 1.5 per cent! None of them make active viruses any more, but some have been recruited into our cellular circuits. One note-worthy retrogene is Arc , which is essential for long-term memory storage in the human brain. Another is Syncytin. Originally from an endogeneous retrovirus, it has got har - nessed to build up the placenta\u2014a unique mammalian organ without which none of us would have been born! These new findings, however, should not confound us. After all, the present is a fleeting snapshot on the evolu- tionary timescale and, like viruses, we are little more than carriers and mixers of genetic information. The rest\u2014cul-ture, history, societies, politics\u2014are facets of human collec-tive imagination. Oability to make copies of themselves. It was certainly not an efficient process, more like a stenographer who makes mis-takes while typing several copies of a document, so soon there were variants of the parent molecule that were com- peting with each other for better duplication. In time, small RNAs (or the more stable DNAs) might have joined to form larger chains of genes, and then a membrane of fats proba- bly enclosed them to form a mobile, self-replicating unit. Alternatively, some proto-cells might have gained both DNA and protein-making machines, but then lost the latter and learnt to enslave neighbours who had both. Probably both mechanisms gave rise to the vast repertoire that makes up virosphere today. Evolution by natural selection had found its way. WHAT is certain is that it's this ancient lineage that has made viruses so ubiquitous. Animals, plants and bacteria\u2014all are hosts to viruses in this timeless struggle for existence. The most abundant of viruses are the bacteriophages, literally the 'bacteria-eat-ers'. But, phages do not only devour bacteria. They con-stantly shuttle fragments of bacterial DNA from one cell to another, creating fresh combinations of genes and thus providing fodder for evolution. Science has put these phage-couriers to good use. During WWI, Felix d'Herelle discovered that bacteriophages could be used to cure sol-diers of dysentery. Popular in the 1930s, phage therapy lost to 'non-living' antibiotics. However today, when antibiot- ic-resistant bacteria have significantly blunted our ability to stop infections, phage therapy is being studied with renewed enthusiasm. In addition, oncolytic viruses are being harnessed to selectively target and kill cancer cells.

An American, the patient was taken in by evening and at night his room was locked from the outside. The door was opened slightly, tremulously, for dinner\u2014it was pushed towards him by a wardboy who scampered back to safety soon after. The HIV danger, by then, was real, clear and present\u2014in 1986, the first cases of AIDS in India had been discovered among sex-workers in remand homes in Tamil Nadu. How the infections first started was never tracked down, though it was clear it had come in via foreign visitors and then spread. India's HIV transmission was largely heterosexual\u2014a later discovery\u2014but the air then was thick with irrational fear, stigma, misinformation. \"In the morning,\" recalls John, \"I had the blood sample and it was pos- itive...full-blown AIDS.\" He accompanied the duty doctor on his rounds, went and sat on the patient's bed next to him, put an arm around his shoulder and spoke to him. \"That's the best lesson doctors got that day,\" he says. The story of how India finally wres- tled AIDS down began that day\u2014'social vac- cine', as the term goes. \"Public education became one of the cardinal rules for its con- tainment,\" says John, who designed the sen- tinel surveillance for HIV/AIDS that continues even today. Think of all those con- dom campaigns and the Red Ribbon Clubs in schools and colleges. The world is now gasping for clarity and a new chance against a new enemy\u2014a highly contagious respira- tory virus\u2014but that social vaccine jab is what will work for COVID-19 too, he says, long before an actual vaccine comes along. After all, the coronavirus is, we're told, something we have to live with. India's head- line numbers of March and April bucked the worst predictions, but now, after four months of living with the virus, we are faced with that experience common to trekkers: the moment you scale a high promontory, a bigger peak swims into view...and then ano- ther. Judging by the altitudes of May and early June, the real Everests may belong to July. \"Now the inevitable is happening. Our goal is now to reduce mortality. Let the virus play its game, but we should now protect all the vulnerable people,\" says John. That's why he's stressing on precaution\u2014the ele- mentary symbols of which are the mask and those physical distancing circles chalked out on the ground. The past few days, India has been reporting a razor's thin edge short of 10,000 cases daily\u2014the country's Covid curve saw no peaks or troughs as elsewhere, no jagged edges; instead it has been arching upwards smoothly, like a yogic asana, to break into the world top 10. With the US, Brazil and Russia taking the medals, India has been in the playoffs with Spain and the UK for positions 4-6 with a caseload up- wards of 2.5 lakh, inching towards 3 lakh. The original European hotspot, Italy, has stanched its haemorrhaging wounds ( for a comparative Covid growth rate graph of all four, with India in the clear lead, see Lockdown story). The good news is that half of those patients have also recovered\u2014so the count of active cases has just crossed 1.3 lakh, less than half of the total 2,67,614 as on June 9. But could this be the actual figure of infected people? Not likely, say most experts. \"We will have some idea of that number once we have some serological data available from the first ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) survey that is being rolled out,\" says Prof Gautam Menon of Ashoka University, who's OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 23 Those actually infected could be 20-30 times the number of confirmed cases. So Infection Fatality Ratio is always much lower than Case Fatality Ratio.COVID-19 SPECIAL Will this pandemic radically alter our approach to public health? It's hard to predict the long-term conse- quences of our approach to public health due to COVID-19; remember we had a similar major scare in the 1990s in relation to HIV/AIDS and while the public health response to that par - ticular disease was outstanding, most of the rest of the healthcare system has remained under-funded, under-performing, poorly gov - erned and largely unaccountable. On this oc- casion, the threat is right at the doorstep of the rich and I hope there will be much greater impact in mobilising support across society for a much stronger public healthcare system.

Think of serolog- ical studies as a dipstick survey\u2014testing lo- calised groups of people for antibodies in the blood to know the average ratio of the popu- lation that had a Covid infection. But until that data is available, a probable yardstick to go by would be 20-30 undetected infections for every detected case, Menon reckons. That range, he explains, is based on the num- ber of deaths\u2014just short of 7,500 so far in India, which can be reasonably assumed to be closer to the real picture (barring a few undiagnosed deaths). How is this done? There's something called the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR)\u2014the number of people who die out of all those who actually get in- fected. This is always much smaller than the ratio of deaths among only the confirmed cases. For COVID-19, the IFR was calculated at 0.37 per cent for a small German town. Extrapolated over Germany by the University of Bonn, even that yielded 1.8 million actual infections\u2014a straight 10 times more than its official figure of 1.8 lakh. Elsewhere, Covid IFRs range up to 0.7 per cent. At this point, therefore, we can only guess at the actual footprint a tiny virus is leaving over this vast landmass. Zoom in on that map. So far, here's what we know: about 30 districts account for 70 per cent of the total Covid cases in India\u2014 the western states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan coupled with Tamil Nadu and Delhi figure prominently there. But, officials warn that the eastern states\u2014Bihar, West Bengal and Assam, to which the flood of migrant workers flowed\u2014could poten- tially emerge as the next hotspots. The numbers are beginning to rear their hoods there. Add to this inclement weather\u2014two cyclones in a span of one month and a mon- soon season just setting in, bringing with it those familiar seasonal illnesses. The situa-tion's fluid, literally. Take Kerala, which had famously kept its infection count leashed down, but is now battling Round 2 with inter-state movement opening up (see Jeevan's Sitrep story). Or take Delhi, where daily cases were around 400 in mid-May\u2014now it clocks 1,400. \"The cities with more infections may be peaking sooner. The other places, Tier 2 and Tier 3, will progress slowly,\" says Dr S.K. Sarin, who heads the Delhi government's Covid re- sponse panel. He foresees a plateau by end- July or mid-August for the capital. \"We are in a relatively early stage, and the peak is still several weeks ahead of us. That could be one guess,\" says Gautam Menon. \"You would really know you have crossed the peak when the number of daily cases begins to decrease.\" Case counts alone don't offer much gran- ular insight\u2014the states differ on many counts. For example, contact tracing. A recent ICMR study showed wide variations in 'contacts tested per case' during the early phase across states\u2014broadly, those with good public health systems did meticulous contact tracing, explains epidemiologist Giridhara R. Babu, a co-author of that study. That's still easy to grasp, as a function of administrative efficiency. But in many other ways, the epidemic settled over the land like a giant cryptic crossword. What explains the fact that, for instance, while both Tamil Nadu and Delhi carried out a high number of Covid tests over a span, Delhi saw 7.8 per cent testing positive, while it was only 2 per cent in TN? The 'test positivity ratio', as it is called, could point to two things. The simpler expla- nation: Delhi could have genuinely had a wider prevalence during that period. \"Different states are indeed in different stages,\" says Babu. \"Or again, testing itself could have been made more targeted and efficient, say by zeroing in on as many severe Extrapolated over Germany, actual infections were pegged at 1.8 million\u2014a straight 10 times more than its of - ficial figure of 1.8 lakh. COVID-19 SPECIAL respiratory cases as possible\u2014a syndromic approach.\" Sharp, constant surveillance is key. Not the easiest thing to manage during 'Unlockdown'. Railway stations are opening up, public places coming alive\u2014eventually, places of worship will draw out the devout from their confines, trying to dispel the gloom. What can be done? Mask-wearing, says John, needs to be en- forced like a sacred commandment. \"Viral behaviour is as predictable as water going down a slope. So if you have a virus that spreads by droplets, it will infect people by social contact,\" he says. \"Ultimately, people have to take precautions for themselves and their families. Nobody has understood that. Even now people shift from the ludi- crous to the sublime.\" Across the world, lockdowns are tapering off. But the coronavirus still places us in a peculiar spot: there's a wealth of information about the virus itself, but some fundamental questions haven't been settled yet. For instance, are asymptomatic patients infec- tious? Is reinfection possible? We haven't heard the last word on these yet. That's another facet of the corona chronicle\u2014a very conspicuous absence of scientific consensus on many fronts. Scientists are indeed work - ing at an unprecedented pace, crossing mile- stones in days and months instead of years. But the deluge of research reports globally seethes like a stormy, troubled sea. Last week's retraction of a controversial study on Hydroxychloroquine in leading journals The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine came by as a shocker amidst this turbulence. There was a controversial India connection there too (see Data story). Since the pandemic broke out, scores of pre-print papers\u2014not yet vetted by peers\u2014 are being put out every week and some of these hypotheses are hotly debated. \"A sig- nificant fraction of that would never make it to peer-reviewed publications,\" says virologist Shahid Jameel, who heads the DBT /Wellcome Trust India Alliance. \"Nevertheless, it's important for the rapid evolution of knowledge. So whatever one reads in that space must be read with that understanding.\" Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University agrees: \"We will need good ideas from everywhere to solve this epidemic.\" Some frictions are inevitable, he says. \"People working in different disci- plines learn for the first time the different ways in which other scientists approach similar problems. This is typical of the sci- entific process and will undoubtedly be sorted out over time.\" The coronavirus isn't likely to go away any - time soon. But why did it come? \"This pan- demic was not a black swan event,\" says Sridhar Venkatapuram, associate professor of global health and philosophy at King's College London. \"Any good epidemiologist will tell you that pandemics were expected. And more will come in the future.\" But it has created an important need to rethink how societies are connected, he says. Countries may have been flinching back from hyper - globalisation of late, going back into their protectionist shells...but here has come along a microbe, like a voice of the planet, to remind humanity that we are indeed one. O OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 25 COVID-19 SPECIAL What does data tell us about the pandemic\u2014 its past and future trajectory? It tells us that the lockdowns have worked in reducing the exponential growth of the epi-demic. The doubling times have increased from around 3-5 days at the onset of the lock - down to somewhere between 15 and 20 days at present. However, the effective reproductive ratio remains above 1, indicating that the epi- demic is still in its growth phase and the num- ber of new cases each day shows no sustained decline. Thus, relaxing our guard now will inevitably lead to a faster spread of the disease. Our models suggest that allowing people to return to work in a periodic but stag-gered manner\u2014say with three days on and six days off, with a third of the population at work each time while being effectively locked down otherwise\u2014can reduce the rate at which dis-ease spreads. Our models also point to the crucial importance of rapid, ramped up testing and quarantining of positive cases as the only way to halt the progress of the epidemic. Gautam MenonProfessor Physics and Biology, Ashoka UniversityVOX POPWHAT vacuum-cleaned of real in- formation, what fills it is the elements of empty anticipation. Rumour, speculation, fear...all these form a suspended particulate matter that we then breathe in. The latest talk doing the rounds was that India would duck back into hi- bernation\u2014into a strict lockdown\u2014by the mid- dle of June or so. Since Indians are familiar with the phenomenon of a late-evening broad- cast fundamentally altering their realities, ap- pending a 'could be' or 'maybe' on that rumour is pointless. But the reason why the situation spawns such speculation is clear. India's Covid graph has been curving up in an unbroken geometric progression\u2014re- gardless of lockdown. Then, in phases since May 3, India has been also opening up: 'Unlockdowning'. For eyes long shut, the light outside was blinding. After our first coronavirus case on January 30, India had taken 45 days to reach 100. Nine days later, as the lockdown started on March 24, we were around 500. But six weeks later, on May 6, just after we exited strict lock - down, we had zoomed to 50,000! The lo- calised surges consequent to opening up bent that curve further upward, like surf on the sea. In another four days, we reached a lakh. As we go to print, we're just 20,000 short of 3 lakh, with 1.3 lakh active cases. It has been messy and cheerless. As we adjust our retinas, what do we see? COVID-19 as a radiating pain, a shifting, pul- sating, intensifying migraine. Some parts of the body in extreme distress; the big cities beginning to choke, with their available ICU bed-to-patient ratio looking alarming; new areas of the hinterland in trauma; even hith- erto healed regions plunged anew into a spreading gloom. Karnataka had had its first Covid +ve case on March 8, but expended good energy on dragging it out\u2014it took 65 days, till May 12, to reach the 1,000-case mark. But that, alas, was when 'Unlockdown 1.0' was already in motion. The next 1,000 cases took a mere 10 days; then eight days; then three days; then four again. As of June 10\u2014another four days\u2014it was on track to hit 6,000 cases with over 3,000 active cases. Manipur had registered the Northeast's first case on March 24, but touched only 29 in the next two months. Over the next fortnight, by June 10, it was aiming for 300, with only 61 cured. Kerala, famously, took nearly two full months to reach 100 after inaugurating India's first case on January 30, then sloped up gently to 800-plus over the next two months. That doggedness went waste when, in one day after domestic flights resumed on May 25, it took a standing leap to 1,326\u2014now it gloomily contemplates 2,000, out of which over 1,200 are still active patients. But economic exigencies mean Unlockdown is inevitable. The question is: How to open up? What can be the mechan- ics of doing it in modulated, calibrated ways\u2014where you can loosen the tourni- quets on our starving economy, while at the same time lassoing down the rampaging OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 27 In big cities, ICU bed-to-patient ratio is alarm- ing, and hitherto healed regions have plunged anew into the Covid morass.COVID-19 SPECIAL 28 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020virus. A bit like an ICU doctor handling a critical patient with multiple points of con- traindications. The layperson wants to know, even more anxiously, if COVID-19 will get him or her sooner or later\u2014the chances of that happening now are in- finitely higher, especially if actual infec- tions out there are close to a million, as some estimates go. Epidemiologists and data experts, on the other hand, are groping in the dark about the shape the epidemic graph will take. In what way, on which parts of the map, will it spread further? And what does the much-talked-about 'peak' look like? Most crucially, can we alter it? Simply, the 'peak' stands for that point on the graph after which the number of in- fected people starts declining. There's, of course, no sign yet of that Mount Meru, the tip of the pagoda. At present, as the govern- ment ramps up testing, India's caseload is only showing a daily upward trend. At the peak, the 'R0' value tips over to less than 1 (see Lockdown story)\u2014this means an in- fected person infects less than one person, so you start descending to the valleys. Now, if 50 per cent of the population is infected, the R0 automatically dips below 1 (see Muliyil interview). But many experts say India should not wait for that\u2014a crucial part of epidemiology policy relates to this. Depending on how policy affects the trajec- tory, experts have also predicted different months, from July to November, for when the peak will arrive. But no one knows what it looks like: how many Indians being Covid+ve at one time. The concept of a peak throws open a whole lot of questions. Should we not look for one peak\u2014and see different states as having different peaks? What about rural and urban re- gions within a state? It's important to cap- ture the dynamics of a disease\u2014that helps us ensure we are as medically prepared as possible. It's not a question of choosing one mathematical model to calculate the infection rate\u2014there are many\u2014as the most convincing and final. The real com- plexity is due to the varying rates in each state. Some, like Maharashtra and Delhi, witnessed a quick surge; others are catching up now. To understand the peak in the context of India, the Department of Science & Technology (DST), under the guidance of the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) and IISc, Bangalore, is trying to create a new model that integrates \"the best features\" of hun- dreds of existing models sourced from gov - ernment and private bodies (they're calling it, well, the 'supermodel'). \"The consultative committee was formed last week, formal proceedings have just begun,\" says A.N. Jayachandra, secretary, JNCASR. The idea is to arrive at a predictive tool with the same prescience as meteorological tools that do weather forecasting. To get there, it's map- ping the pandemic across the globe, trying to understanding the factors that led to specific events, and weaving that into their grid. The model should be ready in a few weeks. \"Using the Susceptible-Infected-Exposed- Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) model, the infec- tion rate in India at the end of May (averaged from May 18-31) was at around 8.5 per cent, which is definitely better than what we started with, around 24 per cent, but also far from the peak. This is a highly simplified model; we are working on more hyperlocal models to derive the 'supermodel' now,\" says Ashwin Srivastava, co-founder and CEO, Sapio Analytics. Sapio is part of the ongoing exercise. Why is predicting the 'peak' a challenge? Data scientists say it's the quality of data\u2014 any presumptive model can only be as good as the data that feeds it. Correct reporting of data\u2014and enough tests to cover an ac-ceptable sample\u2014is not exactly forthcom- ing from every part of India. Scientific assumptions have to fill in the blanks. A section of experts says the peak should be seen as happening state-wise, and should be calculated differently for rural and urban regions within a state. \"At this mo- ment, it's practically impossible to suggest a peak for India. Any model that does so is (deficient of ) required parameters,\" says Srivastava. Positing a peak anywhere from August to November, they also say this range can change significantly based on policy decisions. Manoj V. Murhekar, direc- tor, National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE), also prefers caution. \"I have no idea what the peak will be like and how many in-Experts predict different months, from July to November, for the peak to arr- ive. But should we look out for varying peaks for individual states? COVID-19 SPECIAL fections will make the peak. Experts have given various deadlines, none has come true,\" he says. Modelling the peak on the basis of, say, Italy or US, poses its own issues. \"Many European countries contained the infection within a geographical limit; in India, we have allowed it to travel the length and width of the country,\" says Bhupesh Daheria, CEO, Aegis School of Data Science. State health of- ficials admit the lockdown relaxation and re- sumption of air-services, along with the earlier displacement of migrant workers, took COVID to Tier II-III cities and beyond. Many districts in Bihar, Jharkhand, UP , Odisha have witnessed a sudden rise in cases of late. The Northeast, barring Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura was com- pletely COVID-free and in the green zone till May 25. Dadra Nagar Haveli didn't have a single case. Not so anymore\u2014these places have turned into red zones with cases being reported from even remote districts. Mizoram initially had only one case, with a recovery, says the state's Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) officer, P . Lalmalsawma\u2014\"now we have 88\". Health experts point to the irony of open- ing up after the lockdown itself forced mi- grant abour back to their native places\u2014bad economics, bad pandemic control. \"We cre- ated a huge shortage of workforce in our factories while allowing the infection to travel all across India,\" admits a senior epi- demiologist. A lot of villages in, say, Bihar and UP converted government schools, banquet halls and community centres into quarantine centres to contain the infection. But many smaller cities and state capitals failed to track the incoming population due to the sheer numbers. Patna, for one, is at serious risk. Containment is the initial strategy; if the infection explodes, one has to resort to mitigation. How to stop health system from getting overwhelmed One of the biggest advantages of the lock - down, claimed the government, is that it provided time to upgrade the health infra- structure to meet the demand (see box). Contrary to that claim, cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Indore have started facing an acute shortage of beds in hospitals; patients saying they have to run from one hospital to another is a common scare-story\u2014in many cases, even dying in transit for want of treatment. That suggests OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 29 THE ICMR website shows that, as on June 9, the total number of samples that India has tested was 1,45,216. On May 20, it also claimed that, in just 60 days, it made a 1,000 per cent progress in the country's testing capacities. On January 30, when the first Covid-19 patient was found in Kerala, there was only one lab under ICMR: the National Institute of Virology, Pune. Even till mid-February, samples of COVID-19 patients were being air-lifted from various locations and brought to Pune for testing. Today, ICMR has approved 590 government labs and 233 private labs across India country for the three kinds of tests currently being done to test for the Covid: rRT PCR, TrueNat Chain Reaction\u2014was the only confirmatory test for COVID-19. Out of the three tests it was seen as the most reliable, but it entails complex steps: a specially manufactured swab to collect throat or nasal secretion, a special fluid called viral transport medium (VTM) to transfer the swab to the lab, a viral extraction kit to tease out the virus from the swab, and then finally an rRT-PCR kit to test for viral presence. Even with all four elements present, if personal protective equip-ments (PPEs) were not available for those engaged in the process, testing could not be initiated. Everything needed to be there, at once. Naturally, that limited the scope of its applicability. Considering the urgency of the situation and the need to ramp up testing, ICMR then approved TrueNat (a test for drug-resistant tuberculosis) and CBNAAT (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test) as part of the testing arsenal. \"While rRT-PCR is limited to well-equipped hospitals, TrueNat can be deployed at district hospitals across India, addressing the last mile barrier,\" says Dr Rajni Kant, PRO, ICMR. Till date, 240 labs for TrueNat and 63 for CBNAAT has been given approval. The Council now says it has \"developed and validated the completely indigenous IgG ELISA test for antibody detection for SARS-CoV-2.\" It has transferred this technology\u2014which it calls 'Covid Kavach'\u2014to seven companies that are exp-ected to get manufacturing licences from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) in a month. In April, the Council also faced flak for buying a China-manufactured rap- id-test kit that was supplied to all states. The kits had to be withdrawn after some states reported erroneous results. Though ICMR claims it incurred no fi-nancial loss as no money was paid to the company, the lack of due diligence that led to the goof-up and the ambiguity in financial dealings raised ques-tions. Not to mention the waste of precious time and manpower in the middle of a pandemic.TESTING TIMES ICMR ramps up capacity but controversies abound 30 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020the health system is already overwhelmed: not a good omen, with the peak still far from sight. State governments like Delhi dismiss news reports and public claims about a shortage of beds, but all the signs are that resources are drying up. For one, the various restrictions on treatment and testing; for another, the strange decision in which the Delhi government prohibited people from the National Capital Region from availing any hospital facility in Delhi. (The order has been overruled by the LG.) The Delhi government claims it has a total of 8,575 dedicated COVID beds right now\u2014 4,413 occupied, 4,162 vacant\u2014including government and private. It has also devel- oped a mobile application in which anyone can check this availability. But patients say the app shows something, and the hospitals something else when they reach there. Black-marketing of beds is also being spo- ken of. One scary indication of the short- age\u2014present and/or imminent\u2014came from the deputy CM, where he said Delhi would need 80,000 beds by July end, when the state's caseload is expected to touch 5.5 lakh. The Union health ministry said there were a total of 1,33,632 Covid +ve patients in India as on June 10\u2014an exact break-up of admitted patients is a matter of loose reckoning, because mild/asymptomatic pa- tients are advised home quarantine. Many states had initially kept private hos- pitals out of the ambit of COVID-19 but are now rethinking their strategy. Uttar Pradesh didn't allow a single private hospital to treat COVID-19 patients\u2014not even those willing to bear the costs. Karnataka too. \"At present, all COVID hospitals here are government hospitals,\" says Nandakumar Jairam, CEO, Columbia Asia Hospitals. The government \"may involve private healthcare\" if the num- bers increase. Delhi initially had only three private hospitals roped in for COVID. \"But of late, the state has asked all private hospi- tals to either completely get converted to COVID-19 hospitals or reserve 20 per cent beds for it,\" says Mahipal Singh Bhanot, zonal director, Fortis Hospital. Mumbai has followed a different strategy. It has demar - cated some hospitals as quarantine centres for patients who are asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic/ high risk respectively. The state government has asked all private hospitals to ramp up ca- pacity. It has also notified that 80 per cent of total operational beds (both COVID and non-COVID) will be regulated as per rates specified by the government. But hospitals have their worries: severe shortage of staff, especially non-medical staff like nurses, housekeeping, ward boys etc. Many non-medical staff have got in- fected, absenteeism is high, many are leaving due to fear of catching the infection\u2014 Maharashtra, the current hotspot, is grap- pling with an exodus of sorts. \"We need to understand that our frontline healthcare workers are putting themselves at risk, sacri- ficing their personal lives and working round the clock. They need to be counselled, kept motivated,\" says Gautam Khanna, CEO of Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai. The treatment cost also becomes a bone of contention as soon as private healthcare comes in: many patients complain of over - charging. Experientially, most Indians will say that's true, but it's not always easy to judge. \"When an allegation of overcharging is made, we need to have a standard or mean to judge it by. In its absence, any rate can well be called arbitrary,\" says Nishant Srivastava, managing partner, Actus Legal Associates. The FICCI health services com- mittee recently proposed that treatment costs be fixed between Rs 17,000 to Rs 45,000 depending on the facilities. The gov - ernment hasn't taken any call on it yet. \"Various state governments have an- nounced separate policies for reimburse-ment of care given to COVID-19 cases,\" says Dr Harish Pillai, member of the FICCI committee. This is one end of the drama unfolding across India\u2014private healthcare in the midst of a very urban nightmare. Other, less visible nightmares stalk the countryside.

Perhaps a faint dread preceded it, blended with a resigned sense of inevitability\u2014as if for an elemental event be- yond our control, the way we may anticipate news of a solar eclipse sweeping the land that would offer no clear promise of when the sun would shine again. Still, for a country DID THE LOCKDOWN WORK? COVID-19 SPECIAL blessed with frighteningly fractious opin- ions on everything, there had been near-unanimity on this. No political party, no social segment, no corporate lobby, nor even any healthcare expert had offered a se- rious objection. Stunningly simple at one level, it was also profound in the way it straitened our primary conditions of living. Poets, historians and sociologists will have their say another day. But the immediate, practical question is: did it work? As Week 9, 10 and 11 of the lockdown saw public trans- port and air travel thaw out messily from a freeze\u2014as India daily counts a new crest in numbers, and balks at counting the social and economic costs of internal migration on a never-before scale\u2014one prediction can be safely made. This question will be hotly de- bated even months from now, in ever-new forms. Questions proper to governance in the socio-economic realm cannot really be delinked from the growth path of an epi-demic\u2014they are connected inextricably. But they are also subject to opinions beyond the scope of medicine proper. The original ques- tion still stands: was the lockdown effective in controlling the India story of COVID-19? Contrary to scepticism, that the lockdown slowed the Covid rate of growth isn't in much doubt. Consider a model evolved by Prof Sitabhra Sinha of Chennai's Institute of Mathematical Sciences, whose projections have closely resembled official statistics. Sinha works on publicly available daily sta- tistics that the government puts out and his analysis shows the curve indeed shifted, with a smaller rate of growth. Had the epi- demic continued at its initial rate of growth, active cases would have crossed 2.5 million by May 17, the end of Lockdown Phase 3. And the number, as we know, was around 55,878 that day. 'Active cases' is different from the total tally: it's the total number of positive cases minus recoveries and deaths. Yes, it's still exponential: with the chart galloping at 10,000 cases a day, India will be skimming 3 lakh by the time these words reach you. If this pattern continues through June-July, the figures will begin to look very scary. But there's reason for some grim comfort: cases will go up as long as the Reproduction number of the infection (also called R0, pronounced 'R nought') is greater than one\u2014essentially, that means one affected person can infect more than one person on average. \"It's not a big sur - prise that every day will bring a new record. The thing we need to really worry about is whether the rate of growth has increased or not,\" says Sinha. India's R0 trajectory could offer some clues\u2014Sinha's analysis of national data att- ributed a basic R of 1.83 at the start of the contagion in March and a significantly lower 1.29 for the period April 13-May 14. It re- duced further to about 1.22 between May 29- June 4. Essentially, that means 10 COVID patients can probably infect 12 others. So while the overall numbers climb, that may suggest a cooling of the pandemic's inner fire OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 15, 2020 | OUTLOOK 33 A collective of 600 scientists estimates that 8,000 to 32,000 fatalities had been averted till May 15, compared to a 'do-nothing' scenario. 34 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020as it scythes through the forest of people in India. What explains this decline, especially when lockdown relaxation saw freer move- ment and higher caseloads? The most plau- sible answer, Sinha suggests, is that the national R0 was so far skewed by the early exponential growth in Maharashtra. In rec- ent weeks, Maharashtra's R0 value has act- ually decreased to even below the national average, he says. \"Now you are seeing a crossover. Because Maharashtra is tending to flatten out, other states that are growing at a much faster rate are going to start influencing the India-wise number,\" says Sinha. But those states punch at a lower weight in number terms. Seen an- other way, Maharashtra's R0 is now lower than some states far down the ranking list. \"From a policy point of view, it's very impor - tant to keep an eye on states with a very high R0 because that's presumably where the hotspots might move if you don't take imme- diate corrective action,\" he adds. Overall, there's a mixed picture\u2014in some states like Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, the curve of daily active cases is somewhat flat- lining. In others\u2014like Karnataka and Bihar\u2014 it's climbing. So too in Haryana, Assam and Uttarakhand, where the R0 (as of June 4) too shows a sudden increase. Did the lockdown save lives? The Indian Scientists' Response to COVID-19 (ISRC), an independent collective of around 600 scientists, has estimated that 8,000 to 32,000 fatalities had been averted till May 15, compared to a \"do-nothing\" scenario. Their analysis had come as a response to the Niti Aayog's range of 37,000 to 2,10,000 fatalities averted during lockdown\u2014as the ISRC pointed out, various models had been cited but there was little explanation as to how those numbers were obtained. There are also lateral lines of questioning that can find no quantifiable answers. Should the lockdown's effectiveness be really meas- ured against a \"do-nothing\" scenario? Or against what could have been very decent, very plausible, perhaps better alternatives? Say, having had our antennae and radars up earlier\u2014a month and half earlier\u2014putting in place elements of an early response, tracking and contact-tracing only the 15 lakh or so international arrivals in that pe- riod, creating containment zones only around their hubs, and testing there aggres- sively? Instead, India was in vishram stance all through\u2014even Parliament functioned till March 23...and the very next day it was savdhaan. The whole country had to down shutters with a couple of hours' no- tice. A discomfiting new reality that actu- ally created the movement of lakhs of people from urban hubs. As we said, in epi- demiological terms, difficult to quantify. So what lies beyond a lockdown? The frank answer is that an accurate picture is elusive. From one end of the spectrum of scenarios, epidemiologist Jayaprakash Muliyil offers the unsettling figure of 2 mil- lion deaths and that, \"in three months, we develop herd immunity\". Muliyil argues that herd immunity is the only way out (see 'We have to count...it will stop'). What that means is, when a substantial percent-Should the lockdown's efficacy be measured against a 'do nothing' situation? Or against very plausible, better alternatives? COVID-19 SPECIAL age of the population has been infected and develops immunity, a virus finds it difficult to find a new host, or get from person to person. But, for that salutary stage to be reached, a reasonable guess is that 50 per cent of people will have to get infected, sometimes more. And even countries that initially thought aloud about the idea, like the UK, have balked at it. Even the US, with the world's highest infection count, isn't an- ywhere near herd immunity, according to some experts. EXPERTS concur that lockdowns helped to buy time but the trade- offs started to get skewed the longer they were in force\u2014the human costs in India, given the fact that most of our workforce is in the informal sector with virtually no social security, were far worse than those seen in wealthy countries, says Vikram Patel, professor at the department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School. \"The lockdown definitely slowed down the epidemic. But beyond a point, it is not helpful,\" says Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the US-based Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy. \"You have to remember its purpose was not that the disease will die out. A lock - down was always to buy time to prepare.\" The other crucial question vis-a-vis lock - downs was, of course, how to end them? For, it could be relatively easier to enter a lock - down than exit it\u2014the medical analogy to exiting a lockdown, as virologist Shahid Jameel puts it effectively, is that of a patient on ventilator. \"You decide in a few seconds whether to put somebody on a ventilator. But then you need to wean them off slowly.\" The world over, these are the dilemmatic waters being navigated currently. With the exception of Sweden\u2014an outlier of sorts, it didn't opt for a lockdown, instead relying on social distancing. But Sweden's Covid death toll at 4,656 (as of June 7) is much higher than those of its Scandinavian neighbours and recently its state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell admitted that, with hindsight, things could have been done better. Surveillance indeed is the way ahead, reckons epidemiologist Giridhara R. Babu. But, as a subset of public health in India, the amount of resources or attention given to surveillance has been abysmal, he says. \"If we do not have surveillance systems strengthened and then open up, we are just pretending that nothing is going to happen.\" Both polio and HIV, he points out, were tackled on that very premise and the results speak for themselves. \"We showed we were the world leaders for polio when people said we couldn't eradicate it. They also said that for HIV but they were wrong.\" So, it all boils down to how well we can track and trace: what they call man-to-man coverage in football. \"The only thing we have to mon-itor is the (virus) circulations going on and how we can prevent deaths. If we wait for hospitals to report, it will be too late. The earlier we pick up, the better it is.\" While testing has to follow a systematic strategy, it's still possible to isolate people assuming every case of pneumonia to be Covid unl ess otherwise proved, says Babu. For India, the implications of the COVID- 19 lockdown need to be seen also within the OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 35 Lockdowns have helped buy time. But what next? Lockdowns delay, but do not prevent, the onset of Covid-19 cases. They are not a tool for disease eradication. The costs of the lock - down\u2014including the collapse of the global economy and increased deaths and disease among the poor throughout the world\u2014are already enormous and will have to be paid for years to come. Some alternate policy proposals, such as testing, contact tracing, and quarantining the infected population, cannot work given how widespread the epidemic already is and the likelihood of spread by the asympto-matic population. We are going to have to learn to live with the virus, just as we have learned to live with a host of other deadly infectious diseases.

Based on other epidemics like HIV and ma- laria, most observers expect the COVID-19 pandemic to 'settle' into LMICs while high-income countries will control it, he says. \"Some people have been arguing that we should just let it spread and let people get sick and become immune, and protect those more vulnerable. What they don't say is that potentially hundreds of thousands or millions could also die over the two- three years of waves it would take to create immunity in the population.\" So do we have a picture of the new way of living, the tentative openness, we are head- ing into? Vikram Patel of Harvard Medical School sums it up: \"Let's be clear about one thing: as lockdowns are lifted, it is inevita- ble that new infections will occur.\" Engaging public health assets, such as ASHA workers, with appropriate training and personal protection, to identify cases, trace contacts, and help people self-isolate, may well be the more effective weapon, he says. \"But, at the same time, I hope we must remember that social interaction is an es- sential component of our humanity and without it we cease to have lives that are worth living.\" The initial question, then, de- volves into a web of interrelated questions that will remain with us for the foreseeable future\u2014and the answer can only consist of precise detailing, care and empathetic mi- cro-management. O COVID-19 SPECIAL \"One important rationale for a lockdown is so the administration could focus on the public health crisis. A stringent, sudden lockdown in India was a bad idea because it created an ad-ditional, humanitarian crisis. Rather than redu-cing administrative burden so that pressing concerns like increasing laboratory/hospital bed capacities and creating a protocol for testing could be addressed, the unpla nned lockdown multiplied challenges. The new crisis stretched lim ited state capacities, which has not been directed at dealing with it. One rea-son could be beca use the government was plugged into con v ersations in the developed world, with very different economic structure. Only about 17 per cent of the workforce has salaried jobs here. One-third of the employed work as casual labour, many as daily wagers. Nearly 50 per cent are self-emplo yed, mostly small operators. The lockdown dried up their earnings overnight. It seems our policymakers did not realise how fragile their lives are, how numerous they are. A rerun of Ramayan was announced for the people; the rest don't seem to matter or is visible to the ruling political class, at least not until news reports/viral vid-eos about their condition flooded our media sources.

Leading epidemiologist, former principal of Vellore Christian Medical College, chairman of the scientific advisory committee of the National Institute of Epidemiology...he explains his theoretical preference for 'herd immunity' to Preetha Nair. We are in Unlock 1.0 and alr\u00ad eady seeing almost 10,000 daily cases.... Those are people who are positive. It possibly doesn't mean they are sick. Everybody gets viral infec\u00ad tion, all of them are not sick. Over 80 per cent are sub\u00adclinical cases. We call them 'case'. We keep count\u00ad ing them, we have to count up to 60 crore, that's when it will stop. I think fear is what troubling us. Fear causes stigma, stigma makes you unjust and unfair. But all this is the natural trajectory of an epidemic. We are mostly rural, so it will slow there, then it will come down. Next year, this time, everybody would have forgotten Covid. We live with lots of viruses anyway. Do we remember any of them any time? But Covid is different... It may seem so at the mom\u00ad ent. When HIV and HINI happened, people were frightened. HIV was there for several years, torturing 60 crore,COVID-19 SPECIAL OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 39us. Now nobody is worried. Only thing is, Covid is a pro\u00ad longed one. How do you come to the cal\u00ad culation that India will see two million deaths with a substantial opening up? Based on the mortality expe\u00ad riences from UK and France, their latest publications. I applied the age\u00adspecific cor\u00ad ona death rate through our population. India's popula\u00ad tion is 1.36 billion: one should see the two million in that context. It comes to about two per thousand, much less than Europe. In India, even small percent\u00ad ages give us large numbers. One per cent of Indians is 13.6 million people. So the number of deaths would be high but the rate of death will be low. Some 1.358 billion will still be alive.And 7.5 lakh deaths in the age group of above 60? That's the most dramatic thing. The death rate is very disproportionate when you take age. Above 80 is over nine per cent of our popula\u00ad tion. They will have over 80 per cent share of the deaths. We have 36 crore below age 15. My calculations say they will have very few deaths. For a 25\u00ad year \u00adold, the risk of dying is still only 30 out of 1,00,000, a very small rate. The equation changes as you go up the age graph. For those in the seventh decade (in their 60s), the rate is 2 per cent. In the eighth decade, it's 4 per cent. Ninth decade, 8 per cent. In those groups, mortality is anyway high: whether corona is killing them or another disease, it's not clear. Mayan doomsday portrait\u2014A mural from the Mexican state of Chiapas. Smallpox, measles, influenza, typhus, yellow fever...epidemics introduced by the European colonisers in the New World decimated 90 per cent of Maya and Aztec who had never encountered these germs and lacked immunity against them. Did the lockdown serve its purpose? They could have given one week's time, instead of taking people for granted. New Zealand informed the public several days in advance about the coming lockdown. We just announced it and people got caught on the road. Basically, by doing this, we supported the virus.But we have to open up? You have to worry about the collateral damages of a lock \u00ad down too. Now people are going around sealing hospi\u00ad tals...tragic and ridiculous. People with other diseases will be in danger. There's a number of Covid deaths we expect. We can't help it. The focus has to be on providing services. We have reached commu\u00ad nity transmission, nobody admits it...it's a dirty word for everyone. At one point, one can test, identify and isolate, like Kerala did. This is a different phase. A major \u00ad ity will get infected, most will be fine. Only the ones who get breathless are sick. Adequate oxygen supply will save lives. There's no point testing asymptomatic people. Just treat every pneumonia case as a Covid patient, with\u00ad out testing. How does herd immunity work? Let the young go out and work. In the bargain, they 40 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020will get infected...and be imm une forever. They will not die: infection is nothing, they just walk away from it. When many people develop immunity, the virus finds it difficult to get from person to person. I'm an optimist. For one death, there will be 400 people recovering and devel\u00ad oping immunity. That beco\u00ad mes an immunity \u00adbuilding population. We expect cities to achieve herd immunity at 60 per cent, villages around 40 per cent. Mumbai will come to that phase very rap\u00ad idly because they have many cases. Delhi too. The virus doesn't disappear...it goes into a phenomenal value of R1, a quiet endemic phase where it can remain for months or years. We hope that break will be enough for a vaccine to come. But protecting the elders may be difficult in India... You can't just protect them by issuing a government order. You have to tell them how to protect themselves. Physical distance, hand hyg\u00ad iene, ironing newspapers etc. Make sure even in the house, you wear a mask most of the time. The numbers will come down from 7.5 lakh. Do we see evidence of herd immunity anywhere in the world? Herd immunity levels will be different in different areas... you need above 50 per cent level to reach herd. In a thickly populated place like Dharavi, you need a higher level, above 60 per cent, maybe even 80 per cent. With Influenza A, H1NI, we measured it at exactly 40 per cent. Then it died down. I saw it in 2009, then the next year. (New births occur, people move, so there's always a new population, with a certain percentage who are immuno\u00ad logically susceptible.) It hap\u00ad pens by itself. I say it with confidence because I have seen it with measles, Ebola, chicken pox, rubella etc. Are you hopeful of a vaccine? I'm very confident a vaccine will come, a good one. All studies on the virus show nice immunogenicity...the ability to stimulate our imm une system. So chances are the vaccine is also easy to make. Whether it's vac\u00ad cine or virus, it's our body that produces antibodies. And this virus is not that highly mutant. Will there be a second wave? That's for people who are not immune, never for this virus. My reading is, once you are finished with corona, you are out of it. What about the reports of rei nfection from China et al... Humbug, not a single report. What happened is, they found the virus in the throat of those who had 'recovered' even after 21 days. CDC Atlanta did a careful study... they took the lingering virus and tried to culture it. They couldn't! So NOT infectious. After the ninth day, nobody had any of the infectious virus in their throat. Then what was that PCR test pick \u00ad ing up? Fragments of the virus, not the whole thing. So first we thought it was a pec\u00ad uliar disease that doesn't go away even after immunity. Now we know. This is the truth currently. But with new evidences, it can change. That's science. Is corona here to stay? The virus has found a bal\u00ad ance between itself and us. R0 is the starting rate: every \u00ad body is susceptible. Herd im m unity means R1: one case leads to one case, no epi\u00addemic, just a lingering on in the community. That's what WHO is referring to. Future outbreaks will happen when the susceptible population increases... after a year or two, when a large number of children are born, Covid can again move around. Young people will block it, but it can kill the uninfected elderly. By the time, we will have a vac\u00ad cine hopefully. Experts predict a peak in July.Luckily, I'm not an expert! Usually it takes three months, not over four months. A lock \u00ad down is a break, a temporary delay, so we are slightly bet\u00ad ter off vis\u00ad\u00e0\u00ad vis the peak. But this epidemic will take away a few elderly. In the process, we have to make sure we don't destroy our country. Why are some states so badly affected? We are taking a snapshot in between.... Everywhere the curve is starting. Wait for it to be over. OIs herd immunity the solution? One of the largest surveys was done in Spain recently and the re- sults show just 5 per cent of the population was infected in terms of immunoglobulins. Therefore, looking at 5 per cent and so many deaths, imagine the number of deaths if 60 per cent get infected. So, I'm not a believer that herd im- munity through infection is going to be the solution. Herd immunity has to come from a vaccine. Giridhara R. BabuEpidemiologist, Indian Institute of Public Health, PHFI, BangaloreVOX POP COVID-19 SPECIAL Would all of us get infected sooner or later? Yes, sooner or later.

It was in the air, minus the 'not', all of spring and early summer, tremulously asked, and per - haps frequently (and prematurely) presumed to have an answer in the affirmative. A sense that the virus was somehow less virulent here; that if there was a specific India story to Covid, purely epidemiologically speaking, it was that we were speaking of a more modest dystopia. Merely a stronger version of a passing flu. The data curve was such that it could help foster that impression. It was around three months ago, in March, that the COVID-19 season properly began in India. Soon, the dizzying spiral in Italy had gripped the world's att- ention. Then, within days, that graph was replicat- ing itself in the US. Naturally, the spectre of Covid effortlessly conquering new territories evoked fears. 42 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020DOES INDIA (NOT) HAVE A MILDER EPIDEMIC? COVID-19 SPECIAL But even by April, India's statistics were now here near the worst-case scenario. The question naturally arose: was there some- thing at work besides a stringent lockdown? Nearly every possibility was speculated upon\u2014perhaps the virus was behaving dif- ferently here, maybe it was a milder 'strain'. Maybe there were different 'strains' in India itself....one thing in Gujarat, ano- ther in Gurgaon. The questions were not surprising: we knew little of the novel coronavirus, except that it was beset by signs of seemingly inexplicable random- ness. So how do we begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together? We put the ques- tion to various experts. For a start, the actual spread of the disease across the world is itself an unravelling story. Russia, where they were making music vid- eos celebrating the near-absence of COVID- 19 in the initial days, is now a scare story (see Is Socialism the Vaccine?). And this is a strange, moving earthquake, one that has ser ially found new epicentres: from Italy in spring, to Brazil now. The data dashboard maps out the curve so far\u2014over 66 lakh con- firmed cases globally by the first week of June, out of which about 3.9 lakh people have died. And India has crossed 2.87 lakh cases, still with relatively fewer dea- ths\u20148115\u2014than in many other countries. But the arc had begun to look ominous by May, in such a way as to almost completely negate the original question. So no, it's no longer milder in the ordi- nary sense\u2014we'll have to wait for the final count and look at percentages to make a weaker claim at 'mildness', if at all. And no, the heat certainly didn't kill the virus. One way to navigate this warren of alleys is to try and mark out the actual presence of the virus, as opposed to official numbers. \"Based on the results of seroprevalence studies conducted around the world, we now understand that the epidemic has spread far more widely throughout the (human) population than can be gleaned from case reports alone,\" says Jay Bhattacharya, professor of medicine at Stanford University. By seroprevalence, he's referring to the blood tests that look for antibodies\u2014the body's natural method of fighting an infection. It's a useful tool for epidemiologists to estimate what frac- tion of a population has already been exp- osed to the coronavirus. Last month, a Spanish antibody study indicated that 5 per cent of Spain's population has been aff ected\u2014a figure that held up in a subse- quent second round of survey. Sounds modest? Well, that's nearly 24 lakh people, over a third of the official world total. That may be the actual wingspan of the virus flying under the radar. And here? Well, the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) too is currently OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 43 What explains India's low uptake initially? India's popula- tion structure probably... other countries have a larger representation of the elderly than we have.COVID-19 SPECIAL 44 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020carrying out a household-level antibody survey to estimate the prevalence of the infection in the country\u2014an ELISA test has been developed by the National Institute of Virology to look for Immunoglobulin G (IgG), a type of anti- body. The survey across 69 districts in 21 states could potentially give us a richer, more finely-grained view of COVID-19's passage through India. ICMR favours repeated cross-sectional investigation to establish the actual trends in an evolving pandemic\u2014a kind of live cartography that maps the progress (or regress) of infection in specific districts which, when aggre- gated, offers us a country picture. THE spurt seen in the official count in recent weeks\u20146,000+ cases being docked each day in the last week of May, almost touching 8,000+ as we closed off the month, then scaling 10,000 with a kind of sherpa-like tenacity a week later\u2014 gives us a peek into the spread. But even that may be a fraction. Bhattacharya says various global studies indicate\u2014depending on the locality\u2014that, for every identified case, \"somewhere between 10 and 500 peo- ple have been infected without being iden- tified by healthcare systems as having the virus\". By itself, the view that swab tests alone may not yield a true picture isn't new, because these tests, being time-consuming and expensive, have not cast their net wide enough, especially in India. But, on the other side, antibody survey findings too have been widely disputed\u2014even a paper Bhattacharya co-authored last month was criticised for its methodology (one of the early antibody surveys, it had looked at Santa Clara, California, as a case study). Then, the virus itself. Some pointers of how it spread around the world come from the genomic sequences various labs have decoded. About 40,000 sequences are cur - rently available on the GSAID database, including some 400 from India, enabling researchers to piece together an evolution- ary history, or the phylogenetic tree. All viruses mutate over time\u2014think of them as the typos they make as they replicate their RNA inside the host body's cells, which then get to be a new accepted spelling. The coronavirus is no exception. Researchers broadly group these variations into genetic lineages or clades. Globally, at least 10 clades have been identified, the A2a clade being the most common\u2014in India as well. But there's no evidence to say if any clade is less or more virulent than the other\u2014it's precisely such a claim that had come up last month from Gujarat. All talk about some mutations being deadlier\u2014such as the allegedly more lethal D614G mutation\u2014or references to varia- ble infectivity between the so-called 'S strain' and 'L strain' have now been given a quiet burial. Columbia virologist Vincent Racaniello summarised it with a headline to his blog post, 'There is one, and only one strain of SARS-CoV-2'. The more recent claim from Italy that COVID-19 was \"weakening\" too has largely met the same fate. No serious study anywhere has yet found a significant mutation\u2014either her - alding more virulence, or a weakening. Epidemiologist Giridhara R. Babu of the Public Health Foundation of India sums it up thus: \"What we definitely know is the genetic make-up of the virus is nearly the same all over the world.\" Another scientist working on vaccines says virus mutations don't present a significant issue to research-ers like him\u2014\"the most important protein on the virus is the Spike protein and there is a mutation at a single position, but the rest of the Spike is pretty well-conserved in all the isolates that have been seen to date.\" That doesn't mean science stops looking. \"We can't say yet if a strain is more virulent or not,\" says Rakesh Mishra, director, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, offering a cautious margin note. \"There are some mutations that look unique to our isolates, which is In the initial phase, India saw the infection mostly in young people. When it spreads to the elderly and more vulnerable, the picture will be the same as anywhere in the world. COVID-19 SPECIAL understandable.\" Last week, Mishra's cen- tre\u2014along with its sister labs, the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi and the Chandigarh-based Institute of Microbial Technology\u2014identified five clades that were circulating in India at the beginning of the outbreak. Among them was a new clade, which, the study claimed, hadn't been classified as such before. This new clade\u2014they named it A3i\u2014was mostly from the Telangana and Tamil Nadu region, and seen in some other South Asian countries, says Mishra. THEIR next step will be to see if there's a link between the clades and patients' clinical manifesta- tions. \"We want to see if there is a medical correlation,\" says Mishra. Meanwhile, genomic studies too are being planned to try and tease out a better understanding of the virus and disease progression. There are several questions here\u2014why are such a large number of patients asymptomatic, for instance. But alas, good science needs to be allowed to mature. \"This patient-based gene study will take six months to a year...data generation takes time,\" says Mishra. \"We certainly know more about the disease than we did at the beginning,\" says Gautam Menon of Ashoka University, which is currently building a long-term simulation model for the COVID-19 spread in India. \"Our earlier estimates of the infec- tion fatality rate were probably excessive, and we did not understand the importance of asymptomatic cases in driving transmis- sion early enough.\" Even now, the question of how infectious asymptomatic people can be is open-ended (see Asymptomatic box). An ICMR study of testing data up to April 30 had found 28 per cent of 40,184 positive cases to be asymptomatic\u2014but these were only those who had direct contact with lab-confirmed cases. Throughout the world, the Covid virus is asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in about 80 per cent of infected people. So what explains India's low uptake initially? \"India's population structure probably offers clues,\" says virologist T. Jacob John. \"Other coun- tries have a larger representation of senior citizens than we have. We have a different population pyramid.\" But even though the 65+ age group made up only 6.18 per cent of India's population in 2018 (as against over 18 per cent in the UK and Italy), the sheer numbers are still large\u2014roughly over 83 mil-lion people. In the initial phase of the epidemic, says Babu, we were seeing the infection mostly in young people. \"The moment it spreads to the elderly and more vulnerable, the picture will be the same as anywhere in the world,\" he had predicted in mid-May. Three weeks later, as India takes the fifth spot in the world, we're already there in a gross sense\u2014without the benefit of an age-wise mapping. The real challenge may be to stop this from becoming truly, chillingly Malthusian. O OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 45 Are we in an era of constant and regular viral attacks, since SARS? Is a bigger one lurking? This is an opportunity for India to really under - stand that there have been outbreaks and epi demics in India every year for decades. SARS, MERS, Ebola, COVID-19 are epidemics you are aware of because they worried people in rich countries. Globally, HIV caught people by surprise because most public health peo- ple in the 1970s believed infectious diseases were all under control in rich countries, and they were only a problem of poor countries. What we now know is that there are out - breaks around the world every year, and that some of them can become pandemics. This COVID-19 pandemic was expected, and unfor - tunately, it is not considered to be the worst pandemic that is possible. There are other, even more dangerous pandemics that are possible. Old infectious diseases can come back, and there are new ones coming more frequently. In fact, the WHO has a category called Disease X which stands for a new dis- ease that we have no ideas about regarding its origin or make-up, and they have been pre-paring for what to do with that. Sridhar VenkatapuramAssociate Professor, Global Health & Philosophy, King's College LondonVOX POP COVID-19 SPECIAL 46 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020Ajay Sukumaran THE 'silent spreader'\u2014a patient without symptoms\u2014is the big mystery about Covid. That puzzle actually starts with the symptoms because there's such a wide range of them, and many of them so mild that you may not even notice. On the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, there's a list of 11 symptoms\u2014 nearly half of these, like 'new loss of taste or smell', were added in April, weeks after the global outbreak had begun. These symptoms could appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. By now, there's fair con- sensus that a large portion of Covid patients could be 'pau-cisymptomatic' or experiencing mild symptoms\u2014again, falling into different categories. But how many of them truly don't give out any clues at all of having an infection while they have it? There's no precise statistical answer at the moment\u2014estimates range wildly, from 6 per cent 41 per cent, globally. But the actual riddle researchers are try - ing to crack is: Can they infect others? Yes, warned a group of Chinese scientists back in February. They described the results of a comparative study they had conducted to the New England Journal of Medicine thus: \"The viral load detected in (an) asymptomatic patient was similar to that in symptomatic patients, which suggests transmission potential.\" An NEJM editorial reinforced this view two months later, calling asymptomatic transmission \"the Achilles' heel of current strategies\". It cited a US study that also confirmed high viral loads in the upper respiratory tracts of asymptomatics: \"Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were similarly high in the four symptom groups\" (those with typical symptoms, atypical ones, the presymp- tomatics, and asymptomatics). Using this as a benchmark would alter testing strategies around the world. Currently, since there's no doubt that people with symptoms are indeed infectious, testing has largely been centred on them and their contacts. But this follows a line of epidemic control that perhaps stems from the SARS virus which, while genetically highly similar to Covid-19, behaved differently in terms of onset of symp-toms, a quickly peaking/sub- siding transmissibility, and a lower viral load in the nose and upper respiratory tracts. That's why, \"despite the deployment of similar con- trol interventions, the tra- jectories of the two epidem-ics have veered in dramati-cally different directions. Within eight months, SARS was controlled after SARS-CoV-1 had infected approxi-mately 8,100 persons in lim-ited geographic areas. Within five months, SARS- CoV-2 has infected more than 2.6 million people and continues to spread rapidly around the world,\" said the NEJM edit in April. Virologist Shahid Jameel elaborates on that. In the case of the SARS epidemic in 2003, he says, people were shedding the virus only when they were symptomatic. \"But this virus starts shedding before symptoms appear. And that is one of the reasons why this outbreak has expanded so rapidly,\" he says. Pre-symptomatic patients being infectious isn't new: mea- sles and chicken pox too behave that way. HIV too is a clas- sic example of that, says Jameel. \"With HIV, you don't show symptoms of disease up to 8-10 years after infection but you are transmitting. So there are various examples.\" And yet, doubts about that are also occasionally lobbed into the air\u2014even if not always convincingly. WHO epide-miologist Maria Van Kerkhove this week had to clarify her claim about it seeming rare for an asymptomatic person to transmit the disease on to a second individual. There's no answer yet to the complex question of asymptomatics spreading infection, she said a day later, explaining that she had referred to a subset of studies. \"Comprehensive studies on transmission from asymptomatic individuals are diffi-cult to conduct, but available evidence from contact tracing reported by member states suggests asymptomatically-in- fected individuals are much less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms,\" says a WHO docu-ment. Even if this dovetails with the anxiety of govern- ments to open up, there's science behind it\u2014and the sci- ence on both sides is incomplete. The question, clearly, is far from settled. Do asymptomatics then hold out possible clues\u2014to immunity and even cure? Some think so. A silver lining, perhaps. OASYMPTOMATICS: Can They Infect?

How do you measure it on a real- time basis, count the damages, predict the next building to fall, the next neighbour - hood to be hit, and evacuate everyone safely? Not easy at all, as it turns out. Our need to quantify has loosed on us a vast trove of unruly statistics\u2014data itself gone viral, a tsunami in the wake of a quake. Its sheer scale and speed posed challenges. But there's an additional qualification. The virus, for all the conspiracy theories around it, is an apolitical being\u2014 class-neutral and ideology-agnostic. Data, on the contrary, is deeply political\u2014and not merely at the level of nations or governments. As a unit of knowledge, it is in its very DNA to segue into power\u2014and to bend to its whims. It is owned, it is withheld, it is manipulated. Knowledge, when shared, grows\u2014or so goes an old Indian dictum. But deriving power by knowledge secretly is tradition too. Democracy enjoins upon its keepers an oath to trans- parency on anything that affects the public; opacity means you don't even know what questions to ask\u2014a handy thing during one of human history's most momentous events. Data is also an infinitely plastic element\u2014clay in the hands of the pot- ter. And that's not a uniquely Indian affliction. Witness the Surgisphere scandal in the US. Or wait...it's an Indian-founded analytics company at the heart of the story. It had a data registry said to include some 96,032 Covid patient records from nearly 671 hospitals on six continents. That lured a star Indian-origin cardiac surgeon, with all the requisite gravi- tas, to push through major observational studies into venerable jour - nals, The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine. The Lancet study claimed anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), touted by President Trump as a 'wonder drug', posed an increased death risk to Covid patients; the NEJM paper said certain blood pressure medica- tions did not. Both were retracted within an hour of each other after suspicions mounted about the data sets\u2014which were never made avail- able for peer review. In their apology statement, the authors said they no longer had \"confidence in the origination and veracity of the data, nor the findings they have led to\". But by then, based on that research, the WHO had halted the HCQ arm of its global Solidarity trial. They have since resumed. JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 49 COVID-19 SPECIAL SANDIPAN CHATTERGEE50 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020HCQ, meanwhile, still receives bullish endorsements from Indian advocates. But India is yet to extricate itself fully from the heart of darkness when it comes to data. How many people tested? How many men, how many women? What age-groups? Do we know their blood groups? Co- morbidities? Are there patterns of any sort? Why did we not test enough earlier? The best way to hide data is, of course, to not even generate it. What value was there in saying India had only around 500 Covid +ve cases on March 24 when we had tested only a grand total of 12,872 people by then\u2014not even a handful of apartment blocks? We were logging 1,300-odd tests a day when we could have tested 12,000 a day. The tsunami was born as a trickle. Questions were posed before the Union health ministry and ICMR about their re- luctance to release both raw data and its sourcing: the answer was mostly omerta. Not very conducive to analytics. Over two months on, the ministry website still provides only basic data: the total num- ber of active cases, recoveries, and fatalities, and their state-wise break-up. Asymptomatic? Mildly symptomatic? The number of beds they occupy? No. For more geographical more granular details\u2014for ins- tance, snapshots of district and taluka\u2014state government websites are the only recourse (though Delhi does not confer us with that honour either). Most cripplingly, there's no uniformity in the approach to data collec- tion\u2014hence no comparability. Some states occasionally release age/gender data, some are hazy on that detail. The taps shut com-pletely when it comes to more nuanced in- formation, such as the number of PPE kits available, or of patients on ventilators or oxy gen support in hospitals in the country. There's no such thing as a set of, say, 10 basic data-points that all states religiously gener - ate, so that medical professionals and res- earchers can rifle through them and arrive at reasonable conclusions, so that they can feed bureaucrats and policymakers, so that the layperson can both be illuminated and forewarned. That would speak of a data cul- ture that we just don't seem to have; India as a collective largely behaves as if it's still a family\u2014disease is a stigma that we love to hide from our neighbours. Sorry to disap- point you, we aren't sick. The ministry's daily briefings dovetail perfectly with that information-shyness. When they do happen\u2014one hadn't been held for 10 days as this goes to print\u2014they divulge genuinely valuable details and analyses less readily than they dispense homilies on the merits of physical distanc- ing and pronouncements of 'faraway peaks'. And yet, government press releases are the only official sources of information on such pressing questions as the doubling rate of positive cases, status of PPE kits or updated guidelines for testing protocols. Other crucial elements remain elusive: till date, we have been handed zero details on testing kit production, capacity and imp- ort status. Nor any break-up of the number of tests conducted by private labs and gov - ernment labs and the percentage of posi- tive cases in each. When it does update the total number of RT-PCR tests conducted, There is no basic data that all states generate, so that conclusions can be deduced from them, policy framed and common people forewarned. APOORVA SALKADEit uses the ambiguously-worded 'speci- men'\u2014an imprecise measure of the num- ber of individuals tested, since all Covid +ve cases involve multiple tests with as many specimens. \"So we don't know how many individuals have been tested across India so far. If this basic information is not provided to com- mon people, what else one can expect?\" says a senior government official, on condi- tion of anonymity. A common request made during Outlook's information-gath- ering efforts, it mostly met with a wall of rel uctance. Those who do speak from within officialdom say that besides the lack of data transparency, the situation is fur - ther aggravated by a dearth of the requisite levels of data savvy at both the crisis res- ponse management and leadership levels. What's the SoP? There's none, and that's a major impedi- ment to data analysis, researchers say. The lack of uniformity across states in the way their data is compiled, analysed, reported and presented makes it difficult for those outside the system to access... let alone und erstand. Put that down to ICMR's lack of interest in devising any standard operat- ing procedure. \"What we are working with is highly imperfect because different states, even different districts, have adopted differ - ent reporting and testing strategies. It's not an apples-to-apples comparison. When we put them all on the same graph, it's almost like committing a statistical sin,\" says Prof Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan who heads the Cov- Ind-19 Study Group\u2014a collection of US aca- demics tracking the pandemic in India. She spoke those words at an online symposium organised on June 6 by the Indian Scientists Response to Covid-19 (ISRC) col- lective, an initiative comprising about 600 scientists attempting to provide independ- ent, data-driven, evidence-based informa- tion about the pandemic to the public. Statistical and data reporting infrastruc- ture itself is an issue, says Prof Mukherjee, speaking to Outlook. Owing to \"gaps and misalignments in daily reporting from ICMR...we use covid19india.org. I have been looking for daily admissions and death data related to Influenza-like illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) across India, both historically and now, but have not been able to locate it. This is very important to track in the future as a departure from the historical curve could indicate an outbreak.\" Covid19india.org is a crowd-sourced volunteer initiative that aggregates data from state press bulle-tins, official social media handles and media reports\u2014the gap they fill is obviously left by a retreating officialdom. Another speaker at the symposium, Dr T. Sundararaman, former executive director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre, had similar thoughts. \"The ICMR protocol is very clear that ILI cases which are symptomatic, outside hotspots and con- tainment zones will not be tested. There's a phenomenal reluctance to test sympto- matic patients. But a hotspot cannot be dec lared as such unless you test. So there's this whole chicken or egg situation,\" he said. And why had the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) stopped its monthly reporting of ILI and SARI from February 24, since Covid-19 is \"clinically OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 51 \"Investment in public health, biostatistics and epidemiology is minimal in India and I am sure after this pandemic is over, the need for grow - ing capacity in these domains will be forgot - ten until the next public health crisis emerges. It is a medicine/treatment-focused culture rather than one that invests in prevention/ public health. Maintaining a strong public health infrastructure is a general broader need as there will be many other public health crises aside from a pandemic in the future. I hope this public health challenge gives us an opportunity to advocate for public health, data and data scientists. Data transparency and modelling is key not just in this pandemic, but for information-driven policymaking in general. We need a well-funded CDC in India, staffed with qualified data scientists and public health professionals.\" Prof Bhramar Mukherjee John D.

The only plausible answer is, so that we don't know. \"There's a mountain of data being churned out from various sources, including IDSP and health management information sys- tems, among others. But there's almost no inter-operability; these data don't talk to each other despite a high degree of overlaps,\" Dr Sundararaman noted. Some data anomalies happen even within one system: on May 14, the Delhi govern- ment put out two sets of figures\u2014one man- dated by the high court, another in its daily health bulletin. In response to a court order, it said 1,807 cases were reported that day from various government labs, of which 472\u2014that is, 26 per cent\u2014were positive. Meanwhile, the daily bulletin stated that the total testing done till May 14 was 1,19,736\u2014that was 6,391 more than on May 13, hence 4,504 more than the number given to the court. Numbers from private labs, which report only to ICMR, could have accounted for the difference, except for the curious fact that the number of positive cases (472) was the same in both reports. So private labs tested 4,504 people\u2014earning eighteen million rupees\u2014and found zero? \"How is this possible? That too when 1,807 public lab tests gave 472 positive cases? The state government is either unable to explain it properly or manipulating the data,\" says a Delhi government official. \"If this is hap- pening in the national capital, can you ima- gine the situation in other states?\" Human errors? Several data experts blame a top-down lack of expertise and appreciation for data for a host of ills, including the poor quality of ground-level data collection. Some, how -ever, call it a \"legacy problem\" involving previous governments\u2014yet, the manner of, and motivation for, data collection does change with each change of the guard. And the poverty of the data culture transmits downward. A government data expert says the problem is more individual than insti- tutional. \"If a person is not data-savvy, it leads to a lot of data collection in non-standard formats, leading to confu- sion. There have been multiple changes in the way data was recorded over the last two months even in the country's most signifi- cant city...so public data cannot be consid- ered accurate,\" he says. Dr Raman Sharma, an expert on infectious diseases at Jaipur's Sawai Man Singh Hospital, too says the Union health ministry is not entirely at fault because a lot of data contamination occurs from the ground up. \"Sometimes the patient's age is missing, often the gen- der is not marked. If data transmission from the field is not correct, its analysis is bound to give errors. The Centre is dep- endent on state governments and hospitals for all such data,\" he says. Dr Sundararaman, though, isn't inclined to blame doctors or auxiliary nurse mid- wives (ANMs) for falsifying whole sets of data. \"There's no stake for them to do so. If the numbers upstairs are unreliable, there are complex processes responsible for this... the whole way in which this data manage- ment is done, with senior IAS officers at the top making pronouncements with raw numbers without any sense of the denomi-nators, is problematic,\" he said at the sym- posium. Concerns about the denominator have been raised in a number of indicators and metrics\u2014including cases/deaths/tests per million, as also test positivity and case fatality rates (TPR and CFR). \"In India, TPRs have been staying at 4-5 per cent. It's been argued that this shows there's no com- munity transmission, but it's undeniable that there's wide variation in TPR across states. It's important to monitor such trends at the granular level,\" Prof Mukherjee notes. Her Cov-Ind-19 group published a preprint on medRxiv last month that illustrated the wider problem of national data masking state-level variations by using metrics that don't reflect their het- erogeneity, thereby hampering nuanced analyses and informed policy interventions. As for the case fatality ratio, Ashwin Srivastava, CEO, Sapio Analytics, a data an- alytics firm working with various govern- ment agencies, told Outlook, \"The Experts blame a top-down lack of expertise for data for poor quality of ground-level collection. The poverty of data colection trans- mits downward. COVID-19 SPECIAL OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 53government has adopted a wrong method to calculate CFR. It counts all cases to- gether and then finds the death rate. That shows a low mortality rate because the den ominator consists of cases that should not be included in the pool.\" That is, also the closed cases\u2014the dead and recovered\u2014 along with the active cases. A patient adm- itted today may die in 10-15 days\u2014that's the In the sympo- sium, Dr too flagged the issue of time-lags being neglected. \"If we use the right denominator accounting for the 10-15 days, the CFR would be 4.5-6 per cent. This is internationally comparable. It shouldn't be surprising to learn that the virus behaves in India exactly as it does elsewhere in the world,\" he noted. Others like Dr Sanjay Mehendale, direc- tor (research) at Pune's Hinduja hospital, maintain that data has to be validated bef- ore being released. \"In my 30 years of working with ICMR, I can assure you data will become available in public domains only once it is clearly validated and its quality ensured. It's easy to criticise that the correct data is not available, but you have to agree that if non-validated data is put in the public domain, it will lead to much higher criticism.\" The teaching hospital Many experts feel government bodies are so stuck in fire-fighting mode that they for - get to plan for the medium- and long-term. \"It's one of the main reasons why our situa- tion is so critical right now. Instilling a cul-ture of data appreciation is much needed,\" says Srivastava. Generating lateral data, going beyond the immediate focus of test- ing someone positive or negative, could be of immense value. Studies published in Europe and China, for instance, have also looked at possible statistical links between Covid and genetic variations\u2014such as in the gene that determines blood types. The research papers, while preliminary, sug- gest that people with blood type A might be more vulnerable to coronavirus infection while people with blood type O\u2014which a 2014 study found to be the most common in India\u2014might be resistant to more severe symptoms. How do we know if there's a pot ential correlation unless someone has taken the trouble\u2014over the lakhs of sam- ples tested\u2014to also do a simple blood group test? Researchers now hope that at least ICMR's nation-wide serological sur - vey (see D-G's Interview) analyses samples for genotyping. \"It will help prioritise risk stratification, help public health planning. If an association is found between certain genetic variants and severe outcomes...fut- ure patients carrying that mutation can be screened in a targeted way. Identifying pathways, predicting treatment response and drug targets...it will aid all of that,\" says Prof Mukherjee. Data, like time, is folded into three\u2014there's the past that needs to be understood, there's the present emer - gency that needs to be solved, and most of all, there's the orientation to the future that the other two must feed. This pan- demic, and the next one. India as a civilisa- tion cannot just be a hospital, it needs to be a research hospital that sows and reaps its knowledge for tomorrow. OCOVID-19 SPECIAL Steve H. Hanke, a Professor of Applied Economics at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore (USA) and a member of the Charter Council of the Society of Economic Measurement, spoke to Outlook on why India doesn't have a good data. What could be the reason for poor data generation and management in India? India has a poor track record of maintaining a reliable labour market and other eco-nomic statistics. One important reason for this is that almost half of India's econ-omy is considered to be in the \"shadow economy.\"Do you think it is due to poor data culture or a deliberate attempt to hide the real picture?The problem is a mix of poor data culture and a bloated, corrupt bureaucracy. This is confirmed in a report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP). According to CEIP, the Indian Administrative Service \"is hamstrung by political interference and outdated personnel procedures.\"Is it due to bad data that India is not able to predict the pressure on its health infrastructure? And will it cause an acute crisis in the near future?Missing or low-quality data are always a major problem when attempting to form public policy in the health--or any other--field. It's equivalent to the pilot of an air - craft flying blind.

Even since the lockdown was eased, horror stories have been escaping out of city hospitals like ghouls out to torment the popu- lace. The city's Covid graph is soaring; over - loaded hospitals are turning away patients, letting them die without proper medical care. But what's a crisis if not an opportunity for some extra lashings of mayhem? 54 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020 COVID-19 SPECIAL WHO DECIDES COVID POLICY ?We were not disappointed: two contentious decisions came along from chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to set off a right royal row. One was on barring admission to patients from outside Delhi to state-run hospitals. The order was sent back to the pavilion by the lieutenant-governor, Anil Baijal, before you could pronounce N95. The other was a revised testing strategy\u2014that asympto- matic people will be restricted from testing. Again, the L-G scalped it, directing the state to adhere to guidelines set by ICMR. The soundness of the decisions\u2014or the lack of it\u2014in terms of ethics or effective epidemic policy is one thing. But the episode framed a central conflict at the heart of India's Covid-19 battle\u2014central being an acciden- tal word there. The key question is: who owns an epidemic? Kejriwal's U-turn\u2014from being a votary of aggressive testing to a subdued line\u2014baf- fled all, and gave enough ammunition to the Centre to train its guns on the state. Not only because this was flip-flop\u2014a pandemic is a dynamic flux, and policy needs to be alive rather than rigid. The real issue was whether a state could adopt its own strategy, in tune with its needs, but at variance with the broad national template. There are competing formal frameworks at play here. Health is a state subject under the Constitution. At the same time, a pandemic is a national event\u2014indeed, global. Rich mig rants courier in infection from abroad, poor migrants connect it to the last mile. It calls for national collaboration to solve it, a measure of uniformity in policy. But how much uniformity? And who examines the content of that policy for its soundness? Whose perspectives would feed it? Does it reflect India's multiple experiential reali- ties? Is it consultative enough? A restric- tion on autonomy at state level, essentially, creates the spectre of a monopoly in policy - making. In short, it seems to have fallen upon a tiny virus you cannot see to invoke another thing you cannot see much in India these days: a federal spirit. In a glance, India's COVID-19 policy is overwhelmingly within the remit of a cen- tral body, ICMR. (How did it get that job? See ICMR story.) States have to kowtow to its decisions, even if those often seem short on logic or transparency. There's ano ther entity in play\u2014the COVID-19 National Task Force. It has representa- tives from all states\u2014an ideal candidate, then, to help set a well-rounded, multi- voiced policy. But last heard, its own voice was not being heard. Not that too many policymakers across the spectrum knew what to do with a pandemic. In terms of the quality of actors who filled out the roles, all sides come up short\u2014Centre and states, with stray exceptions. That's why health economist and epidemiologist Dr V. Raman Kutty can ask, \"How much can they test? States have limited resources.\" That's not a constraint unique to states\u2014 \"our health expenditure is very low nation- OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 55 The real issue about Kejriwal's U-turn\u2014from aggressive testing to a subdued line\u2014is if a state could adopt its own strategy that varies with a national template.COVID-19 SPECIAL Tale of two windows Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee does an aerial survey of the damage from Cyclone Amphan with PM Narendra Modi56 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020ally also,\" he rues. Despite being at the forefront of pan- demic control, taking decisions that could save lakhs of lives, most states, at least in the initial months, were in the dark about key decisions: testing strategies, lockdown, suspension of travel, zone classification, almost everything. The nationwide lock - down on March 24, with a four-hour ad- vance notice, caught many states by surprise. The resultant migrant exodus also hit them the hardest\u2014states were left bereft, and states had to cope with the del- uge\u2014that too with nary a talk of central aid. On top of all that, an older virus was infecting the air too\u2014curiously, in selected states. West Bengal, for instance, where elections are due next year. Trinamool Congress spokesperson and Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra says states weren't con- sulted on anything\u2014lockdown or the schedule of Shramik trains. \"We requested the Centre to shut airports and not to run Parliament in end February-early March. They didn't listen. Now that the situation is out of control, they want us to handle the situation,\" she says. The contestation between the Centre and states over federal rights is nothing new. Every regime in New Delhi has tried to curtail the rights of states through dubi- ous constitutional means: indeed, the Congress has authored some of those means. However, the last six years have seen increasing centralisation of power. The continuous tussles one sees over West Bengal, Kerala, now Maharashtra...that has tragically cast a shadow over pandemic policy too. \"The Centre is completely at odds with the federal spirit,\" says Moitra. \"Everyone works together in a pandemic. That's not the case here.\" Mithilesh Kumar Thakur, a minister in opposition-ruled Jharkhand, echoes the sentiments. Asking Ranchi before deciding on a lockdown? No such luck, he confirms. \"We were never consulted, but it is we who get the huge infl ux of migrants. Our CM conveyed his reservations about opening up also, that too wasn't taken into consideration. Now all states are opening up, we too will have to play along,\" says Thakur. One of India's poorer states, Jharkhand's demand for fin- ancial assistance, especially pending GST dues, have often fallen on deaf ears. Nothing better to exacerbate a tragedy. Legally Bound What's the ideal scenario? Of course, the Centre acting as a facilitator, say most exp- erts. Supporting states with financial sup- port, guiding the laggards with a policy grid detailing best practices, becoming a network of shared knowledge, enabling res earch collaboration, distributing its fruits, becoming a nodal point for learning and teaching at once. But what one saw was the Centre draw on its legal powers to monopolise decision-making on key asp- ects: testing strategy, drug protocols, sus- pension of international travel, procurement of emergency supplies, local production of diagnostic kits\u2014things that affected everyone, without anyone being on board. India has invoked the Disaster Management Act (NDMA) 2005 and Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 to do all this, and questions are being asked about the adequacy and validity of the two laws, esp- ecially their conflicting provisions. Under Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act\u2014 which came into being after the Bombay plague\u2014state governments can adopt exc- eptional measures to contain a disease. However, under the NDMA Act, the Union health secretary is entrusted with those powers. Says M.R. Madhavan, president, PRS Legislative Research, \"NDMA allows centralisation of power, which may not be a good thing during an epidemic. That bat- tle has to be as local as possible.\" Legal expert Prashant Reddy concurs, saying the century-old Epidemic Diseases Act badly needs an update. \"The govern- ment shut down the entire country using some flimsy provisions of the NDMA,\" he says. Constitutional expert Subhash While states were kept in the dark, the Centre drew on its legal powers to monopolise decision-making on key aspects: testing strategy, drug protocol, travel, kits, emergency supplies.... COVID-19 SPECIAL Kashyap defends the resort to NDMA. \"Nobody anticipated such a situation. Legal science tells us existing laws have to be read in context, and interpreted so that the present situation is covered till the law is amended,\" says Kashyap. Whatever the legal opinion may be, Maharashtra, the current hotspot, feels aggrieved. \"Under NDMA, the Centre possesses the power to decide on international travel. It delayed the suspension despite our demand. That's the reason for the exponential surge in Mumbai,\" says NCP leader and state cabi- net minister Nawab Malik. The lack of aut- onomy further hamstrung them. States are in a better position to devise strategies to suit their requirements, he says. \"Private labs here were not allowed to get into production of drugs or testing kits, while the Centre erred in buying faulty kits from China,\" he says. A handful of states managed amidst this straitened space\u2014Kerala, Rajasthan and internally too, out Dr Kutty. \"This happened 25 years back. Panchayats have been trained in disaster management. So when emergency meas- ures were announced, they were ready. It's one of the good things that came out of the legislation process,\" he says. Legislating, as it were, to delegate. But up the chain, it's still a picture of conflict. Kerala was keen on conducting rapid antibody tests to check community transmission in March, but never got a nod from ICMR. And anti-body kits developed by Kerala's Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), sent for approval in April, are yet to be green-signalled. Says Dr M. Radhakrishna Pillai, director, RGCB, \"ICMR told us our product didn't have a high sensitivity, alt-hough it had a perfect specificity. They ha- ven't said what is required. If we are supposed to re-engineer the kits, we need to know. There's lack of clarity,\" says Pillai. Lack of transparency is especially prob- lematic, says Dr B. Ekbal, head of the exp- ert panel advising Kerala on tackling COVID-19, because ICMR is neither a stat- utory body nor a regulatory one. \"ICMR works in a bureaucratic set-up. It should act as a dynamic body in this hour. Some standards should be set. Then research ins titutes should be free enough to market their products based on that. Beyond that, ICMR should not act as a roadblock,\" says Dr Ekbal. \"States have different sets of problems, so should be free to develop their own strategies. If Kerala is spending money and testing people, why should ICMR object to it? It's a desire to control,\" says Dr Kutty. Karnataka and Delhi too had been keen in April to conduct random antibody tests, but a kind of denialism about community transmission seems to have guided policy. ICMR's ongoing sero- surveys are expected to throw some light on the topic now. Dr M.C. Mishra, ex- AIIMS chief, says it's too late to deny com- munity spread now\u2014\"all of us felt it was there, but on a minimal scale. I'd say there was a delay in conducting antibody tests.\" Not all are critical of ICMR. Despite being a non-BJP state, the Centre \"always cooperated\" with Rajasthan, says Rohit Kumar Singh, the state's additional chief secretary (health). \"We have the flexibility to decide our strategy, and never faced any shortage of kits,\" says Singh. That's a model of the dynamic, flexible equilibrium federalism should mean. O OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 57 \"The Centre has invoked the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which was not de- signed to handle epidemics.

We are not wor - ried...the situation is not out of control. We have surveil- lance at airports, ports and state borders. But with lakhs coming in, institutional quar - antine is difficult. People who come by road or air can go for 14-day home quarantine if they don't have any symp-toms. Only symptomatic pa-tients are shifted to hospitals. What about contact tracing? It's an arduous task now, but we are still following it. We have strict panchayat-level monitoring. People are fol- lowing the principles of home quarantine. But with lockdown relaxations, they sometimes behave as if they got freedom! Still only 17 deaths.... How? Most of them had come from outside, already in a bad con-dition...like a leukaemia pat- ient back from the Gulf. Our fatality rate is low mainly bec ause we took special care of the elderly, adopting reve- rse quarantine. We had a strong screening system at Preparedness and pre-plan- ning is the key. We devised protocols and SoPs...for ins- tance, hospitals are not to fill their beds to capacity. If a hospital has 500 beds, and gets 500 patients, they should transfer half the pa- tients to the next Covid hos- pital. Half the beds are always set aside for critical cases. In case of a huge surge, we plan to convert private hospitals, institutions and hotels into COVID -19 hospitals. What can India do better to contain the contagion? Every state is doing its best. I would say India should invest more on health. Kerala's strength lies in the strong foundation of the public health system, laid in 1957. This helped a lot during the corona crisis...even in district hospitals, we could afford to set aside 200-350 beds for a corona ward. Is Kerala easier to manage, being a small state? It's not scientific to say Kerala has a low mortality rate because of its size. With a population of 34 million and density of 860/sq km, the proneness to a spread is in fact way more, so it's more challenging. Kerala reported its first case on January 30. New York, with an 8 million population, reported its first case in March. Now New York's toll has crossed 20,000. Are you on course to address monsoon-related diseases? We are extra vigilant and have already taken steps to tackle dengue, malaria, viral fever etc...in the past two years, we have brought down infection-related fatalities.. OCOVID-19 SPECIAL the airport since January; positive cases were immedi- ately transferred to hospitals; ambulances were sent if any - one developed symptoms. Every patient was given extra care, that's how we could save even a 93-year-old patient with a heart condition and his 88-year-old wife. Such care was possible because we stopped the spread from the beginning...we may not have managed if 10,000 patients turned up at once. Is there a threat of commu- nity transmission? I can say community trans- mission hasn't happened so far. Out of the total cases so far, only 10-11 per cent got it via contacts. The rest is all imported cases. Is Kerala testing enough? We have adopted strategic testing. Instead of calculating testing rates per million pop- ulation (TPM), we should view it against cases per mil- lion (CPM)...relative to the size of the outbreak. That way, we are much ahead of many other states. We are testing 67 times more than our case- load, Maharashtra only 25 times. Our daily testing has gone up to around 3,200 sam- ples. We conduct sentinel surveillance (random tests). We have conducted 20,000 rapid antibody tests and de- tected only 25 positive cases; all had a history of contacts. Are you prepared for a surge, the predicted 'peak' in July-August? We are facing difficulties\u2014 people have been entering from hotspots, so the curve we flattened in April is rising again\u2014but we are confident we will manage. The positive cases may go up to 25,000... we are trying our level best not to reach that. We are get- ting prepared with more hos- pital beds and Covid care centres. It will be difficult to handle if we face a situation like Maharashtra. Right now, we are in a good space.

That story goes back to the early 1900s, an era of big discoveries in tropical diseases\u2014it was at the cusp of the 20th century that India-born British scientist Ronald Ross identified the Anopheles mosquito as a carrier of malaria in Secunderabad. 60 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020 COVID-19 SPECIAL ICMR, WHO ? In the years that followed, many med- ical institutes for communicable dis- eases came up\u2014like the Plague Research Laboratory at Bombay, and King Institute at Madras. Then in 1911, an Indian Research Fund Association was founded: that was to become ICMR after Independence. It led research into every pestilence the country saw in the early years\u2014 plague, kala-azar, cholera, small pox. And, post-Independence, its family of institutes began to grow. Among the first were the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad and Pune's Virus Research Centre\u2014what's now the National Institute of Virology. Again, as veteran scientists recall, an era of stal- wart science leaders. COVID -19 now again puts ICMR in the driver's seat, getting both bouquets and brickbats as it guides India's epi- demic response. In early March, when our case count was less than 100, re- searchers at ICMR had successfully iso- lated the novel coronavirus, thereby placing India among the handful of countries to have done so. That first step was critical to developing home-grown diagnostic kits and a vaccine. The res- earch body last month also came up with its own ELISA test for antibodies, given the unreliability of imported kits. More recently, it stood its ground with the World Health Organisation (WHO) when the latter suspended ongoing Hydroxychloroquine trials based on a controver - sial paper\u2014ICMR cited its experience to say there was no reason to suspend trials (globally, trials have resumed after the paper was retracted). No surprise then that a former ICMR scientist tells Outlook the council's response to Covid has so far has been 'impressive'. But India's top medical research body has also battled charges of being tight-fisted\u2014especially when it came to data about tests or while picking laboratories with expertise to join the battle sooner. It also took flak for India's low rate of test- ing in the early part of the outbreak. Noted immu- nologist Prof Indira Nath, however, says she would not single out ICMR or India when it came to specifics like data. \"I would say many countries are not giving clear data on numbers of positive cases.\" A more widespread affliction, then, a mis- placed nationalism that countries display which does not flow from the province of science. And yet, any institution begins to breathe a kind of power when invested with it, perhaps to an excess. That's why Prof Nath, for instance, feels ICMR initially displayed a governmental attitude by only turning to its own institutes when it came to testing. \"The RT-PCR test is done by many accredited labs and researchers, it's a very easy technique. So what you needed was clear-cut SoP and included a lot more insti- tutions from the beginning. I think initially there was a worry that only ICMR-based, or gov - ernment institutes, could do it best.\" That possibly reflects a larger malaise affecting many scientific institutions in India\u2014a bureau- cratic attitude seeping in over the years. \"ICMR has a lot of bureaucracy, so does CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research). What hap- pens, it seems to me over the years as I'm watch- ing all these organisations, is the scientists themselves become bureaucratic,\" says Prof Nath, who was on a committee reviewing ICMR's pro- grammes back in 2013. There's no mistaking the scientific expertise, she points out. But she reck - ons that scientists, as they work with bureaucrats at the top, also tend to emulate them. Of course, India's Covid response involves several agencies. Here's how the tasks are div - ided: testing, diagnostics and vaccine research are ICMR's forte; disease surveillance, which includes generating and compiling data on the spread, is the job of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The ICMR is an aut- onomous body whose director general is also secretary, department of health research. Meanwhile, the NCDC comes under the depart- ment of health services. The NCDC too has a long history. Its origin was the Central Malaria Bureau set up in Kasauli in 1909, which became the Malaria Survey of India in 1927 and later shifted to Delhi as the Malaria Institute of India. In 1963, it was renamed the National Institute of Communicable Diseases. The Surat plague of 1994 proved to be a wake-up call. Seeing the need for better surveillance and preparedness, the government invested money and training to transform the institute into the NCDC. For a rough comparison, think of ICMR as the Indian counterpart of the US National Institutes of Health, and the NCDC on the lines of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The NCDC uses a countrywide network called the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme\u2014a key outcome of the Surat plague\u2014to keep track of outbreaks. \"I can say IDSP is a robust surveillance system, better than in many countries,\" Udaiveer Singh Rana, a retired joint director of NCDC, tells Outlook. But then, as an agency, NCDC hasn't been as visible as its research counterpart ICMR, plausibly bec- ause the health ministry, which it reports to, conducts the daily Covid briefings. Also, as UMich biostatistician Prof Bhramar Mukherjee says, the usual IDSP data flow on severe respiratory cases in India curi- ously dried up during the pandemic (see Where is the Data?). Beyond Covid, ICMR's sphere of res earch activity spans a vast ter - ritory. There have been hits and misses\u2014 some experts point to how the setting up of regional institutes of expertise grew into an unwieldy set-up over the years, putting the social relevance of many programmes into question. Last year, answering a Lok Sabha ques- tion, the government said the number of insti-tutes under ICMR have been brought down from 32 to 26 in a bid to streamline things. Tackling diseases by creating an array of pro- grammes as separate verticals\u2014tuberculosis or malaria, for instance\u2014too has been counter-pro- ductive in the long-run, say some experts. \"The one-disease approach is a chronic disease of India,\" is how noted virologist T. Jacob John puts it. This tendency, he explains, is aimed more at international obligations and less at public health. \"Without universal primary healthcare, TB cannot be controlled,\" says John. The Covid experience, says Prof Nath, may give us insights into the structural changes required in terms of funding\u2014India spends less than 1 per cent of its GDP on research and development\u2014 and the working of institutions. O OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 61COVID-19 SPECIAL 'No underreporting, all the missing links will be answered' 62 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has been at the centre of pandemic control in India. Under the aegis of the COVID-19 National Task Force, it has set the overarch- ing policy on testing and treat- ment strategies, yet its role has faced flak for lack of data tra- nsparency, among other iss Here, ICMR dir ector general Prof Balram Bhargava dis- misses the allegation of un- der-reporting and says all the missing links would be soon explained. Excerpts from an e-mail interview with Jeevan Prakash Sharma. Do you still deny that com- munity transmission has started in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad etc? A majority of cases are being reported from a limited num- ber of cities. And within the cities, there are specific pock - ets. Hence, it would be better to use the phrase high con-tainment zones. Many of the states and cities do not have that much infection: hence, it cannot be generalised. Prevention in containment zones and in clusters will be decisive in stopping future spread. Local governments and individual citizens need to play a responsible role COVID-19 SPECIAL here. ICMR has conducted a nation-wide sero-survey in 69 districts, covering a popu- lation of 24,000 people. This has recently been completed and its results will indicate the exposure due to COVID - 19 in the community. Health experts feel the mon- soon will aggravate the situa- tion\u2014there's speculation on reaching the peak around July-August.... When can we see a flattening of the curve? The reproduction number of the virus determines its transmission, hence the spike. There is no concrete evidence that the virus multi- plies higher in the monsoon season...how the rainy season will affect the transmission needs to be seen. Since this is a novel virus, it is difficult to predict its future course of spread.Are there different strains of the virus in India? To understand the progres- sion of the virus in India, we require a phylogeographic analysis with samples from each state. Current sequenc- ing data gives us over 220 (isolates) from India; the maj ority belong to the A2a genotype. The GISAID's huge database has not revealed much beyond the mutation recorded in different coun- tries; their role still needs research. Is COVID -19 behaving differ - ently in India? The virus's behaviour is de- pendent on its host and can have a varied effect based on the host immune status. Experiments need to be per - formed in order to assess whether the strain circulat- ing in India is milder or viru- lent. The SARS-CoV-2 virus being an RNA virus has a comparatively higher muta- tion rate. Any tests on India-specific strains? On their infectivity, lethality, ability to survive on various surfaces? As the different strains for the SARS-CoV-2 are con- served (they have a similarity of ~99.7%), the same tests are being used to identify the virus. Experiments need to be performed in order to ass- ess infectivity, lethality. Some studies are there on its ability to survive on different surfaces*. Is India under-reporting? We have crossed one lakh tests per day. If we compare to any other country, we are doing better from the begin- ning, ratio wise. Rather than doubting, we must appreciate OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 63COVID-19 SPECIAL the holistic efforts made by every sector of the country to enhance diagnostic capacity and pool testing, especially ICMR and VRDLs. Do we know why some dis- tricts are badly affected, oth- ers aren't? What explains, for instance, why Dharavi in Mumbai, where social dis- tancing is not possible, initially witnessed low transmission... Some districts are badly aff- ected\u2014Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Ahmedabad etc\u2014because of high movement, being cities. And it's not true that Dharavi showed lower transmission. It has seen a surge; strict con- tainment has reduced the incidence. Some experts still hold that Indians are more immune compared to the West... There is no study or research which has proven that Indians are more immune compared to Western coun- tries. There is also this hypothesis. Is there any correlation between BCG vaccination and immunity? BCG's positive correlation in protecting against COVID-19 is still not proven by any clinical trials.any outbreak is containment. So, more focus was but natu- rally given to that, to increas- ing the robustness of diagnosis, and increasing testing capacity. Secondly, it was important to become self-sufficient by developing indigenous testing and diag- nostic kits for different kinds of research related to COVID -19. In comparison to other countries, children have been less infected; all credit goes to the lockdown the development of ELISA for antibody tests\u2014and bec- ame the first step towards an indigenous vaccine, being de- veloped in partnership with Bharat Biotech. ICMR is also participating in the WHO Solidarity Trial which will look at the beneficial effects of Hydroxychloroquine, the Lopinavir-Ritonavir combi- nation therapy, Interferon beta-1a and Remdesivir. The study also seeks to under - stand the benefits of HCQ as prophylaxis in healthcare workers. ICMR has also initi- ated plasma therapy trials and published a special Covid supplement to its scientific journal\u2014the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR)\u2014 which includes 24 editorials, perspectives, policy pieces, protocols, short commentar - ies, review articles and origi- nal research papers from ICMR and non-ICMR researchers. How close are we to an indig- enous vaccine? ICMR has transferred the virus strain to its partner, Bharat Biotech International Ltd (BBIL), for developing the indigenous vaccine. It has also initiated work with the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Oxford University to fast-track phase I/II clinical trials of the live attenuated recombinant vaccine for COVID -19 developed by the Oxford Group. We have also partnered with DBT /ICGEB for development of monoclo- nal antibodies for the treat-ment of COVID -19 patients. We have evaluated over 30 drug candidates/repurposed drugs for identifying promis- ing treatment options. Opening up has led to a surge. What's your strategy? The first and foremost prior - ity should be to contain the infection through social dis- tancing, following adequate advisories like using a mask, washing hands properly and avoiding crowded places. Besides, the elderly and the comorbid population must be taken care of, as they are at higher risk. *(Reference- Ren SY, Wang WB, Hao YG, et al.

Nutrition? Immunity? Better treatment? It's not correct to say Kerala has shown a faster recovery rate than states like Maharashtra and Gujarat. There could be possibly many confounding reasons. The Nipah outbreak awakened the populace, so social acceptance of emergency moves being implemented helped. There's sharp criticism about data being withheld or not even being generated? Won't a more holistic and open ap- proach to comparable data help everyone? Initially, the priority during and continuous monitoring and testing. Now, as a task force, we are undertaking many projects and following lines of research...all the missing links will be soon ans wered.

Major research studies car - ried out by ICMR recently inc lude the isolation of the virus, with India becoming the fifth country to do so. We also did the whole genome sequencing, which helped in Q How is Namami Gange different from its previous version and how well it is progressing to achieve its goal? It is a unique initiative in many ways. We have been talking about Ganga cleaning for a very long time and several schemes and actions plans were made earlier. However, what really differentiates Namami Gange when it was announced in 2014 and formally launched in 2015 is its integrated and comprehensive approach based upon long scientific research by a group of a consortium of seven IITs. Earlier the focus was on cleaning only. Now it is on the rejuvenation of the river which is much beyond cleaning, a comprehensive approach to tackle and find solutions to the challenges posed to Ganga in several sectors such as wastewater and solid waste management, industrial pollution abatement, river front development, Biodiversity conservation, Afforestation, River management Planning, wetland conservation etc. Under this mission, the approach has been changed from only pollution abatement to integrated mission for conservation of Ganga and its tributaries. It is like restoring the wholesomeness of river to the extent possible. We have embarked upon a A clean Ganga river is the dream of every Indian. The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), aims to achieve this through Namami Gange. Though efforts were made since the late 80s to keep the river in its original state, the desired result remained off the mark till May 2014 when the Modi government came to power. A year later, the new government made an integrated and comprehensive approach to restore its piousness and glory by making several vital additions to the previous schemes. Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, Director General, NMCG, who has been entrusted with the gigantic task of achieving the dream of the nation, says that the new initiatives have already started showing the perceptible change in the quality of water. An IAS officer of 1987 batch from the Telangana cadre, Mishra has achieved many targets ahead of deadlines with his dynamic and inspiring approach. In an interview with Outlook, he reveals how soon a clean Ganga will be a reality. INTERVIEW process of scientific river rejuvenation for the first time in India. The two basic requirements to rejuvenate the river are, first the Nirmal Dhara which means unpolluted river and second Aviral Dhara which means maintaining a continuous flow. Besides that, we have also looked at the complete ecology such as aquatic life, flora and fauna, sediments etc so as to rejuvenate it in all aspects. So far as achieving the goal is concerned, out of 313 projects taken at a cost of Rs 28,966 cr, 122 projects have been completed and the remaining are at various stages of execution. These projects are related to pollution abetment (sewerage infrastructure, solid waste management, Industrial pollution abetment, rural sanitation and water quality monitoring); development of riverfront, ghats and crematoria; afforestation, biodiversity conservation, research just to name a few. Several major drains falling into Ganga have been intercepted and diverted to STPs -new and old. Almost 80 major drains in five states have been tapped and stooped waste water directly falling into the river. The Sisamau Nala in Kanpur, nala at Rishikesh are other notable examples of such tapping. Along with short term goals, we have tried to achieve long term sustainability through Hybrid Annuity Mode (HAM) projects and \"One city One operator\" approach. Q Now when 37% project is already complete, can we perceive these changes on the ground? Of course, we can see the water quality improvement along the entire stretch of river starting from Gangotri till the West Bengal. One of the indicators is the amount of dissolved oxygen which should be 5 mg per litre. In the entire stretch of Ganga, it has gone beyond that. Another indicator is BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) which should be less than 3 mg/litre. 351 polluted stretches of rivers in the country identified in 2018 by CPCB were prioritized on basis of BOD from category I to V , with category I being most polluted or critical. At present, not even one stretch of Ganga is in priority I to IV . There are only two stretches left now, that too in priority V . For the first time, notification for ecological flow was issued for River Ganga in October 2018, formally establishing the right of river over its own water which has far reaching implications for ensuring river health in long term. Because of the improvement in water quality the sighting of aquatic life of the river especially Ganges Dolphin has also increased. Excerpts -:There is a marked improvemenT in GanG a's waTer qualiT yrajiv r anjan m ishra Director General, NMCG, So there has been a marked improvement in water quality in the last few years and I think compared to many other rivers in the country, Ganga is in much better condition. Q How has been the response of the various state governments towards the river rejuvenation schemes? Every state has naturally shown interest and enthusiasm as the cause of restoring health of mother Ganga is unifying and with universal appeal. The difference in approach often comes due to capacity constraints, lack of scientific data and planning. We do a lot of capacity building exercise among urban local bodies of all the states. They need a lot of hand-holding for preparing detailed project report or decisions during tender process. All projects in Haridwar, Rishikesh, Muni ki Reti -the main cities in Uttarakhand on Ganga, have been commissioned and most other STPs in state on Ganga towns are also complete. It is a big achievement as the river meets the large population and hence pollution load from Haridwar and Rishikesh. Almost entire Prayagraj now has sewerage network and STPs. Varanasi saw completion of 140 MLD STP at Dinapur and 120 MLD at Goitha. One city one operator approach HAM projects have been started for Kanpur, Prayagraj, Mathura etc. Mathura project has pioneered reuse of 20 MLD treated waste water in Mathura refinery with IOC sharing cost. In Bihar, Namami Gange projects are increasing treatment capacity by 10 times from existing functional capacity of about 60 MLD to 650 MLD. In Jharkhand, Sahibganj STP is already functioning and the only other STP on Ganga at Rajmahal will be completed in few months. Several projects in West Bengal too are making progress. Q Give us a brief detail of the cities identified along the river for pollution control and how do you plan to implement various schemes? As I said earlier, we are looking at the river in continuity, so right from the beginning till the end, we have got mapping of 97 towns done on the bank of the river. There are over 4600 villages in these 97 towns. Then we also identified villages and towns on the tributaries of Ganga because Ganga cannot be cleaned unless tributaries are pollution-free. Out of 313 projects, 152 are sewerage projects costing roughly over Rs 23000 cr. 39 out of those 152 are on tributaries. These tributaries help maintain a good flow. So after identifying cities, we conducted intensive work to find out the condition of existing STPs and their capacities. Out of 50 STPs, some were defunct and some under-utilized. So besides rectifying the defunct ones, we improved the capacity and constructed new one keeping in mind the demand in 2035. For smooth operation and better governance, we introduced a concept of \"one city one operator\" which means one agency has been given the responsibility to construct new STPs, rehabilitate old STPs as required and maintain and operate all STPs-new and old for 15 years. Further, to improve performance, we introduced Hybrid Annuity Mode (HAM). Here, we pay to the concessionaire only 40% of its cost initially. The remaining 60% will be disbursed in 15 years with interest. Q In the past, crores of rupees were spent on cleaning up the river with no noticeable impact. How well is the money spent being monitored and how different are the outcomes this time around? The prior programmes for clean Ganga had a total allocation of less than Rs 4000 from 1985 to 2014. Under this government, it has been significantly scaled up through a dedicated outlay of Rs 20,000 cr for the period 2015-2020 with 100% central funding. A total of 152 sewerage infrastructure projects has been sanctioned to create 4856 MLD treatment capacity in the Ganga basin. In 2014, only 28 projects existed for only 462.85 MLD. Projects have been taken up as per a comprehensive plan for all the 97 cities/towns along Ganga. Subsequently, projects for tributaries have also been started. Prior to Namami Gange, there was no effective mechanism for linking the payment of operation and maintenance with the STP performance. Q How soon a clean Ganga become a reality? Cleaning of a river is like cleaning your house. It is a continuous process and cannot be said that once done will not be repeated. The cleanliness needs to be maintained. We have to keep river clean and flowing. Ownership has to be taken by people. It cannot be the aim that any government-local or federal can clean up the river or rejuvenate the river. River cannot be cleaned in one day, it has to be kept clean & rejuvenated and that is why our mission also very strongly works for improving people- river-connect and several things are being done to improve the condition of banks. Q How has lockdown improved the quality of water and what is the lessons learnt and plan of action for futureThe nationwide lockdown imposed in the wake of COVID - 19, has resulted in overall ecological improvement due to curb on several human activities. There has also been improvement in quality of air and water. The improvement has come but we cannot have these kind of situations normally and we cannot depend upon such crisis to improve our river. Keeping river healthy must be our responsibility and we have to have long term perspective. There are many factors which combinedly resulted in the improvement of the Ganga river water quality during this period like increased flow in the river due to intermittent rains and lack of requirement of water for agriculture during this period, improved sewerage infrastructure in cities along the Ganga, reduction in industrial effluent discharge in the river, negligible human interaction with the river in terms of religious/ bathing activities, mining activities, motorboats activities, tourists. Out of several sources of pollution, municipal sewage remained almost at same level as before lockdown, while other sources were reduced to minimal level during lockdown. If we talk about the improved sewerage infrastructure and curbing pollution along ganga towns, several landmark projects have been completed intercepting several major drains falling into Ganga and diverting them to STPs - new and old. One of the important steps towards sustaining the river quality is creating awareness among people. Sustainability can be achieved by focusing on involving people living on the banks of the river. Everyone should be actively involving themselves in Swachhata & water conservation activities. Behavioural change is not only needed for keeping the river clean and achieve Nirmalta, it is also required for demand side management of water and improve water use efficiency to reduce abstraction which is very important for improving flow in the river to achieve the objectives of Aviralta. It has been again clearly demonstrated during lockdown that rivers do not pollute themselves, but those who live on its banks and run industries, business etc are to take responsibility. People's connect with river and their awareness is very important to rejuvenate the river. We have to learn the lesson from ecological resurgence during lock down that, even if we go to the river which we revere so much, we love so much, we have to change our behaviour, we have to control ourselves, we have to regulate ourselves. nJeevan Prakash Sharma Short stories can afford to come with a twist in the end. But epics are fated to contain twists at every turn, at every level of the laby - rinth of nested stories. COVID-19 is proving to be one such gigantic and perplexing hall of mirrors: the logic unfolding in a sub-plot at Level 5 can alter the main narrative frame...ARE YOU IMMUNE ? COVID-19 SPECIAL and then twist again. Immunity is a word that's been lurking around like a minor character with a walk-on part in the story from the begin- ning. There was at first that partly na\u00efve opti- mism in the idea that Indians, on account of exposure to a rich bouquet of pathogens, have a kind of all-purpose 'native immunity'\u2014a Teflon coating against Covid. As the new coro- navirus plugged into India as a collective host, that was soon quietly replaced with a more modest, and perhaps illusorily durable, hyp- othesis. That if the virus strains were the same as were lacerating Italy, the UK and US, Indians looked at least more immune than the West. Could it have something to do with blood groups and variable vulnerability thereof? Was it the wall-to-wall coverage of BCG vaccination? The questions seemed valid enough. After all, through Season 1, the India graph had moved at a gentle canter, with a low (official) fatality rate to boot. But as those ominous hoofbeats picked up in May, even that was discarded for a more fragmented picture. Some regions within India looked less (or more) at risk. Over 30 districts witnessed a wide spread, others experi- enced slower transmission. And seemingly inexplicable variations within that defied a universalising story. It still looks deadliest in Maharashtra, as the state exacts the highest toll. In Delhi, it looks more infec- tious but not as fatal as in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Kerala has a tremendous rec- overy rate; no other state has that. But soon it became clear that one key play - field of variations existed at a still more micro level: not country, not region or eth- nicity, but individual. Young Keralites in their 30s were dying in the Gulf, but back home in hilly Ranni, 93-year-old Thomas and his 88-year-old wife Mariyamma tested positive, even got critical and stayed so for days, then happily recovered\u2014defying everything in the COVID 101 handbook about the elderly being at higher risk. By now, this randomness is a leitmotif of the COVID story: you as a patient may have merely experienced an unpleasant fortnight (with your \"pizza tasting like cardboard,\" as writer Karan Mahajan told The Atlantic), but your neighbour goes to the ICU, perhaps thence to the mortuary. Why? Two axioms stay with us: the new coronavirus has shown an extremely varying propensity and poten- tial to infect, and an equally puzzling unpre- dictability about who recovers and who does not. And perhaps neither has to do with the virus per se. Some variation in recovery rates could owe to differing healthcare prac- tices and treatment protocols (at state/hos- pital/country level). But the lens surely needed to be adjusted to another level of magnification\u2014because one key act in this grim drama unfolds inside the individual. This is where immunity comes in. All other things being equal\u2014age, health, exposure to virus\u2014why does Person A get infected and Person B go unaffected? That's simply hard-wired innate immunity: a healthy body's first line of defence against pathogens, an in-built fortification. This inv isible armoury of the body is by nature OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 67 The coronavirus has shown an extremely varying potential to infect and a puzzling unpre-dictability about who recovers and who does not.COVID-19 SPECIAL 68 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020capable of warding off new enemies\u2014so the fact of this being a novel virus wouldn't matter. The innate system has non-specific barriers that work regardless of who the enemy is\u2014the body-castle's moat, draw - bridge and mortar-fire repel Viking and Mongol alike. By contrast, adaptive (or acq\u00ad uired) immunity is like an active database of prior infections: it invests the body with a pathogen-specific immunological memory. An 85-year-old person's body thus carries the memory of a childhood measles infec- tion, but is too slow to produce antibodies against a new enemy\u2014hence, more at risk. \"This is why children are more protected: their immune systems are simply stronger. That wanes as you age,\" says Calcutta pae- diatrician Dr Aniruddha Maitra. A point of mystery: COVID-19 initially seemed to spare children altogether. Thus the famous 'double peak' seen in other infections\u2014older people and children being most vulnerable, healthy adults of median age being the har - diest\u2014was markedly absent here. But as the pandemic spread, even children are seen to be not entirely out of its sway. But regard- less of age variation, think of a first layer of armour. Now, say the enemy penetrates that arm- our, via a Trojan horse, and you do get inf-ected. Why only a mild flu for X, and ICU for Y? Well, post-infection, innate immu- nity continues to work, now in collabora- tion with its brother-in-arms, adaptive immunity: it smells out the foreign inva- sion, and enlists its ally to produce the amm unition...the antibodies. Infla- mmation happens, like sirens going off, sig-nalling for reinforcements to rush to the infected site. Usually, this is when you get fever with any flu, before the body recovers. This is where the critical twist in the plot comes. It's a cataclysmic breakdown of these normal immunity processes\u2014this complex wartime communication machin-ery\u2014that's now looming forth frighteningly as a final act. A sudden, little understood crumbling of the fortress. A gasping, shud- dering death. The key episode, called a cyt\u00ad okine storm, is now linked to many a Covid fatality. \"It's a centerpiece of COVID-19 pat hology,\" writes Tufts University immu- nologist Alexander Poltorak. \"The killer is not the virus but the immune response.\" Essentially, an exc essive reaction or dys- regulation of the host's immune system, akin to what happens with autoimmune disorders. The system goes into hyperac- tive mode, then goes berserk and launches a stunning mutiny against the body itself\u2014 till the whole zeppelin comes flaming down. This happens when immunological agents fail in one key function\u2014recognis- ing self-substances, and exempting them from attack, while it goes for those nasty \"non-self\" macromolecules (the foreign pathogens). The realisation that there's a consistent pattern of Covid fatalities being linked to this inner suicidal drama has led to a reori- entation of efforts across the world. That's why proposed/ongoing studies posted on the US National Library of Health's ClinicalTrials.gov bear titles that refer to therapeutic strategies targeted at critically ill patients who've suffered or are close to an immunological burnout\u2014by modulat- ing or suppressing their immunity pro- cesses. A Lancet study called immunosuppression \"a double-edged sword\" because the body may be still vul- nerable to any infection, and leaving it The breakdown of immunity through a cytokine storm triggers a dys- regulation of the host's immune system, similar to autoimmune disorders. Safety in numbers The possibility of herd immunity is a vexed question in Indiaber eft of its armour is risky too. As a focus area, though, it has dawned. But first the macro-level, before we descend the steps. Are Indians immune? 'Native immunity' is actually just a synonym for innate immunity, but let's twist it to fit us 'natives'. Have Indians been conferred with an ability to take on all comers of the micro- scopic variety? Have we acquired a greater immunity by way of familiarity with viruses in general? Would that suffice to thwart a novel and tenacious one like Covid? The idea that prior exposure to other infections can create an all-purpose shield isn't entirely erroneous. There is such a thing as 'cross- res istance', which can work by altering the way receptor sites behave. But India's climb- ing numbers do not seem to offer any blan- ket comfort there. Why? One reason could be that low nutrition lev - els enfeeble the delicate web acquired weaves in conjunction with innate. It's the latter's signalling apparatus\u2014a complex, multi-function communication grid involv - ing constantly patrolling sentinel called neu- trophils, our most abundant White Blood Cells, and proteins called cytokines\u2014that rec ruit the good guys with the Bofors gun, the B-cells and T-cells. (Roughly, the first produces antibodies that lock onto antigens on the surface of pathogens, and calls upon phagocytes that eat them up; the latter kills infected cells). Micronutrient deficiency leaves this double-barrelled defence fortifi- cation starving at all levels. The internet is awash with preprints of studies linking, for instance, Covid morbidity with low Vitamin D levels (severe among the old in Italy, Spain et al). Elina Hypponen, an Australian nutri- tional and genetic epidemiology professor, offers preliminary support \"in theory\" for the link, writing: \"Nearly all immune cells have Vitamin D receptors (showing the in- teraction). The active Vitamin D hormone, calcitrol, helps regulate both innate and adaptive immunity. And deficiency is associ-ated with immunity dysregulation.\" So, on that front, India fundamentally represents a vulnerable mass of humanity\u2014and it goes beyond vitamin deficiency. (see https://bit. ly/379uA2z). What about BCG? Can vaccination against bacterial infections even conceivably work against a virus? Well, there's a new line of theory on 'trained immunity'\u2014the idea that, say, a vaccine can modify our innate system's pattern recognition receptors in such a way that they pick up similar antigens on even new enemies (antigens are surface struc- tures on microbial bodies). But it begs fur - ther study.... \"As of now, there is only correlation,\" admits Dr Maitra. And as Lancet warned in another context, \"correla- tion does not equal causation\". Despite India's recent surge in cases, some researchers are willing to give a chance to BCG, a mandatory booster for children in India to protect them against meningitis and disseminated TB. \"While COVID-19 caused a lot of deaths in Spain, its neighbour, Portugal, witnessed a very low fatality. And Portugal is the only European country where BCG vaccination is still prevalent,\" says Dr Sudhir Bhandari, senior professor of medicine at Sawai Man Singh Medical College, Jaipur. \"The BCG association, like that of hydroxychloroquine, arose because the early spread of Covid was a reverse image of these two, but there are multiple possible explanations for it without ascrib- ing a causal link,\" says Ranchi-based radiolo- gist Dr Manish Kumar. Many medical professionals anyway dis- OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 69 Are we more immune? Does BCG, heat...any of that matter? Does having a younger population? Younger population, yes. Not the others, of course. There is no difference in immunity, I think the only difference is that we got the epidemic later\u2014India, Pakistan, Bangladesh all got it later. Remember, at one point in the global curve of number of cases, we were at number 39. Today, we've caught up.... So there's no question of us being more immune, it is just how countries managed their lock - down. There is no escaping the virus. Dr Ramanan LaxminarayanDirector, Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, WashingtonVOX POPCOVID-19 SPECIAL 70 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020miss the notion of India (or any other coun- try) collectively having a higher immunity, citing the interplay of several factors that inf- luence transmission and fatality. Dr Yadu Singh, Sydney-based cardiologist, for ins- tance, attributes Australia's \"spectacular\" flattening of the curve (a mere 7,227 cases as of June 4, some 6,640 recovered, 102 deaths) to simply \"good policies...and civic sense\", adding it has nothing to do with high immu- nity among Australians. But even if coun- try-wise variations are possible, we're still in the grip of a story that evokes fear and awe: the perennially unravelling mysteries of Covid, and how your body can itself unravel, a deadly denouement where immunity is the tragic protagonist. An evolving death The Covid infection was initially thought to be a merely respiratory phenomenon, aff- ecting only the alveoli in the lungs\u2014and bringing on pneumonia. That's still the pri- mary effect: the lung's ACE2 receptors are the most abundant, most strategically placed, most amenable to hosting the virus. But it's becoming clear that it often causes a \"multi-system disorder\", says Dr Maitra\u2014an all-pervasive attack on several fronts. Heart, guts, liver, kidney, brain...all cells can get inf ected because most organs have ACE2 rec eptors. A captured heart can go into myo carditis, an inflamed liver produces an enz yme glut. Most benignly, the gut lining; an altered gut flora equilibrium leads to the loss of appetite and/or diarrhoea common to many diseases. The UK officially added the loss of taste and smell as part of Covid symptoms on May 18\u2014either as a present- ing symptom, signalling an early onset stage, or independently, without other symptoms. Indeed, isolated anosmia and ageusia are now seen as a tool to screen potential spreaders, for these are often associated with a milder form of the virus\u2014patients \"10 times less likely\" to go on to be critical. The reasons for anosmia/ageusia are not understood yet. One view is that ACE2 is also present in cortical neurons, making them potential targets. Another is that it's likely to be a secondary effect\u2014the nervous system, for instance, is dependent on blood oxygen to function properly\u2014rather than a direct infection of the nerves, as in, say, forms of meningitis or encephalitis. This brings us to another potentially crucial site: blood. It was controversially proposed in a ChemRxiv preprint by two Chinese schol- ars and then reiterated by Italian pharmacol- ogist Annalisa Chiusolo that the Covid virus manages to plug on to red blood cells, crack open the haemoglobin and release the en-closed iron. This was then linked to all the obs erved chain of catastrophic effects: anae- mia, excess iron choking the kidney; silent hy - poxia (from a hindered exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide) starving all organs, inc- luding the brain; thrombosis, with all its usual effects (heart attack, stroke) et al. Blood was also a putative candidate to explain Covid's rainbow effect: the all-pervasive nature of its attack on the body. The theory is hotly dis- puted, even if Ebola too famously wrought havoc on blood systems in unexplained ways. The idea that the virus cracks open haemo- globin molecules (haemolysis) may or may not endure. Then where do we take all that stunning variety of symptoms? Well, recent understanding inserts a vital first step: immu- nity-gone-awry. Once that happens, your body-castle turns into a house of cards and caves in. That's cause; haemolysis, thrombo- sis et al are effect (https://bit.ly/3cGOKli). So the real twist in the plot is when your body starts eating itself. An uncontrolled immunological self-immolation. And it's cytokines that do the arson. \"Small pro- teins important in immunological pro- cesses\" and produced by white blood cells are called macrophages, their job is to \"trigger inflammation\" and \"recruit\" other immunological elements to fight infection. Why they dysfunction is because Covid manages to \"silence\" this inflammatory res ponse, and grows in the body in what an Atlantic article called \"stealth mode\". When the body realises belatedly that it has been totally besieged, the immune sys- tem goes into overdrive: cytokine storm. A mass attack ensues on infected cells. The lungs fill with a sea of dead cells, a kind of biological sludge that leads to organ failure. The blood clots all over, blood vessels leak, BP plummets because of vasodilation, anaemia occurs. Somewhere along this dis-astrous slope, they start turning on even healthy body cells. Just like any other auto- immune disorder, it's an aberrant overre- action that some people have. Including, it's now known, a subset of the children who get infected. Why only they have it is one of the mysteries of science. Thus, from a struggling country down to a self-immo- lating cell, the view is different at each step down the baoli. And the last step promises a pool of water with no clear reflections. O Amidst India's Covid surge, some are willing to give a chance to BCG, which protects chil - dren against TB and meningitis. But this begs further study. COVID-19 SPECIAL There is no cure or vaccine for coronavirus. So far, there is no con- sensus on a treatment protocol either. Once infected, the treatment is largely supportive, based on managing symptoms. Many propos- als are in the air or the lab\u2014in the exploratory stage, trial stage or real-time in-vivo experiments on patients. Some proposed medi-cines, such as hydroxychloroquine, have been highly controversial. Here are the treatments being tried out across the globe\u2014many are not backed by scientific evidence while others are downright harm- ful. The list, therefore is descriptive rather than prescriptive. For the uninfected Vaccines are in the trial stage. There is speculation that existing vaccines like BCG and flu shots could protect against coronavirus. Vitamin and zinc supplements. While a balanced diet helps you stay healthy, there is no evidence that supplements boost immu- nity. Biomodulina T, a thymic peptide obtained from bovine sources, is being used in Cuba to stimulate the immune system Immunity boosters from alternative systems of medicine\u2014ayurvedic products such as Shadang paniya powder, Agastya harityaki and camphor; and homeopathy products of Arsenic album 6/ Eupatorium perf 30/ Lycopodium 30). Doctors have termed these medicines quackery and cautioned against their use. The most effective preventive measures are wearing a mask, wash- ing hands, maintaining hygiene and practising social distancing For mild cases Symptomatic treatment with over-the-counter medicines such as paracetamol to relieve symptoms. Hydration and rest For mild to severe cases Anti-viral drugs like fabiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir etc. Russia has approved anti-viral drug Avifavir to treat COVID-19. A combination of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin has been proposed, though there are indi- cations that it might have adverse effects in certain patientCuban product Interferon alfa-2b. Interferons are proteins that the body's cells produce in response to infections to signal nearby cells to heighten anti-viral defences. Interferon drugs, lab-made versions of the proteins, have shown promise in the treatment of hospitalised patients in Wuhan, China. Ulinastatin, which is used to treat acute pancreatitis and septic shockAcalabrutinib, a medicine used to treat mantle cell lymphoma (a kind of blood cancer)Antibiotic treatments are being used for bacterial co-infections in patients with pneumonia For critical cases Respiratory supportive strategies: Oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal cannula and non-invasive ventilation might prevent the requirement for endotracheal intubation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (a machine that pumps blood outside the body to an artificial lung for oxygenation) is an important life-support strategy. Plasma derived from the blood of patients after recovery contains antibodies against COVID-19. Convalescent plasma therapy is an old technique that appears to be clinically effective and reduce mortal- ity in initial studies. Circulatory support and fluid management through measures such as fluid administration Monitoring and management of the functioning of vital organs such as heart, kidney, liver etc to prevent organ failure.Nutritional strategies such as gastric feeding to ensure that critically ill patients are not malnourished In cases of cytokine storm A hyperactive immune system response where the body attacks its own cells while fighting the virus. As lung tissues die due to the cytokine storm, the air sacs fill with fluid, causing shortness of breath. In such cases, immunomodulation (modifying the immune system's response) is done through \u2014corticosteroids (improves clinical outcomes and reduces mortality in cases of severe sepsis) \u2014cyclosporine A (immunosuppressant used in autoimmune disorders)\u2014tocilizumab (used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis) COVID-19 SPECIAL WHAT IS THE TREATMENT ? JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 71Protein Shake: Like any wily criminal enlisting a hardworking but unacknowledged insider for clandestine access into a protected setup, Don C uses a cell protein called angiotensin-converting enzyme II, or ACE-2, which sits next to human cells and whose task is to regulate blood pressure of various organs, head to toe. He latches onto this protein and uses it as a gateway into the cell, where he rapidly makes a bunch of little progeny, and the host cell dies. Other proteins play a role too. Like the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a receptor-class gene that encodes a protein and whose biological function is yet unknown. The job becomes easier for Don C if both receptors are present in the same cell. Go For A Nosedive: Don C enters the oral airway through the nose\u2014behind your beautiful face sits the mucous membranes, nasal passages, sinuses. Say, if you touched a contaminated surface and ran your hands over your nose, or if an infected, 'unmasked' person talks to you up-close. Oral fluids contain about seven million SARS-CoV-2 copies per ml, and one minute of loud speaking generates more than 1,000 virus-containing droplets that remain airborne for eight minutes or longer, especially in enclosed environments. Well, Don C rides those projectiles and finds a welcome home in the inner lining of the nose (mucus-producing goblet cells and ciliated cells) that contains ACE-2 and TMPRSS2. He reproduces rapidly. The hijacked cells release interferons, a signaling protein that activates anti-viral defence of nearby cells, which in turn sets off the immune system alarm. Stormtroopers, the body's soldiers, are scrambled and if they don't beat back the gangster here, he slides down the trachea to the lungs and the oesophagus to the gut. Invisibly, of course! Don C: The Coronavirus Family's new don\u2014a cousin of SARS of 2003. Codenamed SARS-CoV-2, he began small in Wuhan in December 2019 and quickly became the world leader (like most Chinese products). With a diameter of 75 to 160 nanometers (a good face mask can hold him off) and a continuous linear single-stranded RNA (genetic material of viruses), he is lightweight\u2014around 0.85 attograms, or about one millionth of a trillion gram (70 billion of him makes a person sick, which is about 0.0000005 gram). But he packs a killer punch. Like all things underworld, he is a parasite; needs a host to survive and procreate (the abundant human species plays perfect surrogate mother and wet nurse). Known weakness is soapwater/disinfectant that breaks down his biological suit: the fatty shell protecting his protein/RNA (imagine a hen's egg). His primary murder weapon is COVID-19. Relies on stealth; a cough, sneeze or touch makes the fleet-footed killer change location instantly, constantly\u2014\" Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahi, namumkin hai !\" 72 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020 How COVID-19 kills? Frankly, we know little. The cunning, stubborn virus acts like no pathogen modern science has ever seen. Although the lungs are ground zero, doctors and scientists are realising that it is attacking its human host with devastating ferocity\u2014from the brain to the toes, and the heart and blood vessels, kidneys, gut in between. Here's a snapshot of what we know so far, based on publicly available data and studies/reports, some published at warp speed and not yet peer reviewed at the time of publication. Wait for research to sharpen the picture.The C-CompanyCOVID-19 SPECIAL DESIGN BY LEELA TEXT CURATED BY tera khoon pee jaunga \". In the lungs, oxygen transfers from the alveoli to the capillaries (tiny blood vessels that lie beside the air sacs). But a cytokine storm triggers blood clots, which break apart and land in the lungs, blocking vital arteries. Don C may directly attack the lining of blood vessels, which are rich in ACE-2 receptors. Lack of oxygen, from the chaos in the lungs, can damage blood vessels/alter oxygen uptake. Some COVID-19 patients record extremely low blood-oxygen levels and yet not gasp for breath. The blood vessels become inflamed throughout the body, causing vasculitis\u2014a form of which, seen in kids, is the Kawasaki disease. Patients with pre-existing damage to those vessels (from diabetes and high blood pressure) face higher risk of serious disease. Eyes, Toes In The Ballroom: Don C may cause conjunctivitis\u2014red, watery eyes\u2014though it's not clear if he directly invades the eye. Besides, blood vessel constriction can cause ischemia in the fingers and toes\u2014a reduction in blood flow that can lead to swollen, painful digits and tissue death. Reports also suggest a man's testes are loaded with ACE-2 receptors, which raises the possibility of the don giving a kick in the groin. Does he really like to hang out down there? Picture abhi baki hain ! Kill Dill: Your heart has abundant ACE-2 and the don loves it. Low oxygen can collapse your heart from a cardiac arrest and clots from arteries block it, especially the left ventricle\u2014 powerhouse chamber of our blood pump. Or a cytokine storm could ravage the heart as it does other organs. Stomach This: Don C slides down the foodpipe to the stomach, also a rich source of ACE-2. The classic COVID-19 symptoms\u2014diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain\u2014are believed to be the don's misdoings in the gastrointestinal tract. Similarly, ACE-2's presence in the liver and bile ducts makes these organs vulnerable too. Plus, lack of oxygen will inflame the liver. Other events in a failing body, like drugs or an immune system in overdrive, can damage the liver. Kidney Binned: Devoid of fresh oxygenated blood, the kidneys will fail. They will need dialysis because the body's filters, abundantly endowed with ACE-2 receptors, present another Don C target. Ventilators boost the risk of kidney damage, as do antiviral medicines. Cytokine storms can dramatically reduce blood flow to the kidney, causing renal failure. And pre-existing diseases like diabetes can increase the chances of kidney injury. Bheja Fry: Don C can infiltrate the brain's neurons/the central nervous system, much like his cousin SARS from 2003 could. He may cause meningitis and encephalitis, while blood clots can trigger strokes. A cytokine storm can provoke brain swelling. It's not clear how Don C enters the brain. ACE-2 plays handyman, perhaps. Our top floor is endowed with this enzyme. Some believe he travels up the nose through the olfactory bulb\u2014which explains a loss of smell that Don C's victims experience. Liquid+Oxygen=Lungs: Don C does to the lungs what Ajit became famous for\u2014\" Isko liquid oxygen me daal do. dega aur oxygen ise marne nahi dega .\" The lungs have microscopic air pockets, called alveoli, like holes in sponges, for the gas exchange: inhale oxygen, exhale CO2. They have two types of cells, or pneumocytes. Type I helps in the gas swap. Type II produces a layer of goo\u2014surfactant\u2014that keeps the alveoli from sticking when it collapses/expands, like a bellow. Don C targets Type II that has the ACE-2 receptor, and triggers an inflammatory response and the body sends out Stormtroopers. But the troops go berserk. The body suffers an auto-immune disorder: a \"cytokine storm\". Cytokines are chemical signaling molecules that guide an immune response. In a storm, cytokine levels soar beyond what's needed, and immune cells start to attack healthy tissues. Blood vessels leak, blood pressure drops, clots form, and catastrophic organ failure can ensue. Your alveoli starts filling up with fluid\u2014pus and debris from the fighting. Fluid accumulates in the interstitial space too, the gap between your cells. Your lungs are drowning to death. You are intubated to a ventilator for oxygen support. That's pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome et al.

Traditionally, a vaccine's clinic-to-market cycle can take upwards of a dec- ade. Though the global health emergency brought on by COVID-19 has looked like catalys- ing that marathon into a sprint, the race has reg- ulatory, scientific and market hurdles to overcome: the transitionfrom proof-of-principle to commercial development will be plagued by bottlenecks. And attrition too will play its part: 74 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020 VACCINE RACE\u2014 THE CANDIDATES COVID-19 SPECIAL industry benchmarks peg the failure rate at greater than 90 per cent. No wonder the European Medicines Agency dismisses claims of a 'cure by Christmas'. All this unfolds against a backdrop of geo- political tensions and 'vaccine nationalism'\u2014 faultlines that grew wider still at the WHO's 73rd (but first 'virtual') World Health Assembly on May 18-19. Just days later, Donald Trump was to announce that America would be \"terminating its relation- ship\" with WHO. But at the Assembly, US- based biotech firm Moderna was making a pitch for Olympic gold. One of around eight candidates in clinical trials, Moderna cited early, non-peer reviewed data from Phase I human trials that began in March to ann- ounce that its mRNA-1273 vaccine had \"elicited an immune response of the magni- tude caused by natural infection\". That is, after the trial vaccine was administered, a small group of volunteers had shown levels of antibodies comparable to or better than those in recovered COVID-19 patients. Levels claimed to be capable of stopping the SARS -CoV-2 virus from replicating, suggest- ing\u2014but not proving\u2014a degree of immunity. Only days before, one of Moderna's directors, Moncef Slaoui, had been named chief scien- tist for 'Operation Warp Speed', a White House initiative to accelerate vaccine devel- opment. Unsurprisingly, the FDA is \"fast-tracking\" regulatory reviews for its vac- cine. All said, Moderna looks on pace to del- iver on its \"early 2021\" timeline. On a macro scale, this is a case study of the pandemic-induced new normal in vac- cine development: novel (read unproven) technologies and approaches, fast-track political interests\u2014and record levels of international collaboration...and compe- tition. The accelerated development path- ways were mapped out in a March 30 article published in The New England Journal of Medicine by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the influential Norway-based mul- tilateral non-profit that's bankrolling outlined \"pandemic para- digm\" is instructive: inter alia, a call for par - allel testing of animal and Phase I (of three) human clinical tests and scaling up manu- facturing capacity even before safety and efficacy data are available! With the exigencies being what they are, how do you even advocate scepticism? Well, actual efficacy is a good enough reason, and only one. \"While having over a 100 vaccine candidates sounds good, it's important to remember we will be phenomenally lucky if just a handful of the approaches...make it through to licensure,\" CEPI vice-chair Dr Gagandeep Kang has been quoted as saying. This caution against an assumption of 'imm inence' or inevitability is a refrain taken up by scientists and public health of- ficials\u2014they liken the odds of success to playing Russian Roulette. WHO health emergencies programme executive director Dr Michael Ryan labels the prospect of finding a vaccine a \"massive moonshot\". OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 75Having over a 100 vaccine candidates sounds good. We will be lucky if just a handful of the approaches... make it through to licensure. COVID-19 SPECIAL 76 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020President Trump has been bullish about a vaccine to 'keep America great' in an elec- tion year, but the (since sidelined) head of his Coronavirus Task Force, Dr Anthony Fauci, says there is \"no guarantee\" a poten- tial vaccine is going to be effective. What's worse, he cautions, in trading safety and ef- ficacy for speed, a vaccine might actually \"backfire\" and strengthen the virus. What about India? There's frenetic action in the worlds of science and pharma here\u2014 the promised speed with which the silver bullet may arrive depending on who's speaking, whether it's a repurposed version of an old vaccine or a novel technology, and whether it's emanating from pure research or is prodded along by industry linkages (including global collaborations). We also have official word. Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan says four of 14 vaccine candidates might begin clinical trials within five months. Dr Vardhan, appointed the other day to the WHO executive board rotational chairman's post, is of the (rela- tively) conservative opinion that a vaccine is at least a year away. It's a call-to-arms to the Indian scientific community from the government, so financial support/regula- tory clearance should be a cinch. The story is running along several tracks, both inde- pendent of and tied to events elsewhere. So a quick scan of the world story must precede the India one. But the key scien- tific determinant here, as in China or the West, will be: what kind of vaccine is it? What does it do, how does it propose to stop this infinitely plastic enemy? Dr Shahid Jameel, noted virologist and CEO of Wellcome Trust-DBT India Alliance (a leading research funding char - ity), speaking to Outlook, offers a prelimi- nary description: \"None of the vaccines claim to produce a sterilising response (protection against infection). In fact, most vaccines protect against the disease in that they don't allow the infection to escalate. This is a fine point that must be understood. Infections do happen, but the vaccine stops the virus from spreading from the primary site of replication (throat and nasopharyn- geal space) to secondary sites (lungs). It's the secondary infections that cause most of the mortalities and morbidities.\" Dr Jameel is not one inclined to stand with all the nay - saying on COVID-19 vaccine development. But outright credulity may be inadvisable too. \"There's no vaccine for either the SARS or the MERS coronavirus in humans, a clue to how difficult developing a vaccine for SARS -CoV-2 is,\" said Dr David Salisbury, ex-director of immunisation at the UK health department, during a webinar at London think-tank Chatham House. \"Like any horse race, you pick your horse without the benefit of knowing whether it would win.\" The reference to the SARS virus is apt since the genome sequencing of SARS- CoV-2 is said to exhibit over 79 per cent of genetic material identical to the virus beh- ind the 2002 epidemic (and 50 per cent of the MERS virus). Both viruses are com- prised of RNA strips surrounded by a fatty sheath through which its spike (S-) pro- teins latch onto the same receptors on the host\u2014the ACE-2 enzyme attached to the human lung's surface cells, for instance\u2014 and go on to extend and infect the cells. What Kind of Vaccine? Past failures have not deterred big (and small) pharma from attempting to unlock the virus's secrets. Moderna and some 20 other candidates (per the WHO) are taking advantage of a revolution in sequencing and genomics to create messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines that instruct human cells to create a protein specific to SARS-CoV-2 in order to trigger a defensive immune response. There's also a plethora of alternative app- roaches. Nipping Ad5- nCoV vaccine has emerged as a dark horse after becoming the first candidate to both move into Phase II clinical trials and release peer-reviewed data. It's a recombinant ade- novirus-based vaccine\u2014that is, its base is one of the common cold viruses, manipu- lated and weakened in the lab. A 'proven platform', in industry parlance. A study in The Lancet found it to be both \"tolerable and immunogenic\" (stimulating an immune res- ponse) 28 days after vaccination. Another front-runner was US firm Inovio, whose CEPI-funded DNA vaccine INO- 4800 has had to weather accusations of 'charlatanism'. Their approach supposedly involves having a hand-held smart device use an electrical pulse to open small pores in cells through which optimised DNA plasmids can enter\u2014overcoming an issue with DNA and erate antigens that trigger an immune res- ponse. In addition to triggering neutralising antibodies in animal trials, Inovio claims INO-4800 generated \"high levels\" of T-cells\u2014deemed the key scientific deter- minant will be: what kind of vaccine is it?

One of the fastest horses out the gate was the Jenner Institute at Oxford University whose adenovirus-based ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine\u2014now being co-developed by drugmaker AstraZeneca\u2014 appears to have rebounded after taking a hit over a reported inability to both pre- vent, and stop the spread of, infection in animal trials. This vaccine also targets the virus's S-protein. The India Vaccine? Factors beyond science are at play because of the stakes involved\u2014national pride, big money. Dr Jameel cites the fact that China may suffer from a \"capacity and trust defi- cit\" that puts off foreign investment. And trade publications attribute a lot of the negative buzz to Wall Street short-sellers with vested interests. Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Pune-based Serum Institute\u2014 among A 'gentleman's agreement' between Poonawalla and Jenner Institute head Dr Adrian Hill has been reported. On its basis, Serum is repurposing its factory to produce sufficient quantities of the vac- cine for low- and middle-income countries starting September, when Poonawalla has said the vaccine will be ready. A claim only matched in ambition by the scale of invest- ment, given Dr Hill's recent estimations of the likelihood of a vaccine at \"50 per cent\". Serum has also reportedly hedged its bets through tie-ups with US biotech firms Codagenix and Novavax, as also Austria's Themis Bioscience GmbH, to potentially manufacture three other vaccine candidates. On the other end of the scale is a start-up, the Pune-based Seagull BioSolutions. The first to be funded by the Union ministry of science and technology in April, its expe- cted timeline for entering Phase-1 trials is 18-20 months. Incubated under the Technology Development Board's 'Seed Support System' scheme, Seagull will use its proprietary Active Virosome Technology (AVT) to create novel active vir osomes (highly artificial delivery virus vector platform. Founder-director Dr Vishwas Joshi says his tech has the advan- tage of not needing the virus to be \"cultured, isolated and replicated\" as in other app- roaches. \"All we need is the seq uence. With that, we can create AV agents after evaluat- ing the best suited antigen cocktail to stim- ulate the body's immune res ponse without getting compromised,\" says Dr Joshi, not- ing the AV agents will target both SARS - CoV-2's S-protein and basic structural proteins. Scale is a challenge for \"cash- strapped\" Seagull, so it has entered into Bangalore- based Biocon. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Biocon's executive chairperson, tweeted about the project in April and is rep ortedly keen on its ease-of-commercialisation pot- ential. As is Dr Joshi, though he says \"deci- sion-making processes in big companies take a long time\". Some Rs 56 crore has been earmarked for start-ups working on COVID-19 solutions, says Department of Science and Technology (DST) secretary Ashutosh Sharma. There's also Rs 100 crore for vac- cine development under PM CARES. Helming this push are the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), the coordinating agency here, and the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC). In April, DBT-BIRAC selected three projects\u2014from and reg- ulatory help. The selections, DBT says, cover both efforts to repurpose existing vaccines and facilitation of novel ones, and fast-tracking will be enabled via a research consortium funded by the National OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 77One of the fast- est off the block was ChAdOx1 nCoV-19...it app ears to have reb ounded after an 'inability' to stop the spread of infection in animal trials.

The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) too is attempting to design and test derivatives of the spike glycopro- tein for potential vaccine candidates through Mynvax, an IISc-incubated start-up. \"If the world is to get an affordable vaccine, Indian companies will absolutely play a leading role. No country can match our manufacturing capacity and produc- tion rates. But much of what we do relies on conventional technologies. Through collab- oration or self-innovation, our facilities will need to be refitted with new technologies,\" Dr Jameel says. Speaking on National Technology Day (May 11), WHO chief scien- tist Soumya Swaminathan too said, \"The world will not have enough vaccines for everyone if India is not part of the process.\" It was nearly mid-May when India offi- cially tossed its hat into the ring, with ICMR tying up with Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech (BBIL) fully Rajni Kant, direc- tor of ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) at Gorakhpur, est imates six months to a year for clinical trials to be completed. \"Of the 17 isolates of the virus obtained at the National Institute of Virology in Pune,\" he says, \"one strain that showed potential was purified, charac- terised and transferred to BBIL to develop and manufacture a truly made-in-India vaccine.\" ICMR has promised \"continuous support\" to fast-track the has also received DBT funding to try re-engi- neer its inactivated rabies vector platform for COVID-19. It's also working on CoroFlu, a one-drop nasal vaccine that uses a flu vaccine \"backbone\" being devel- oped in a global collaboration.

In Ahmedabad, Zydus Cadila is working on two options, inc-luding a DBT-funded DNA approach, while an arm of the state's DST has inked MoUs with three Caveat? As Dr Jameel says, \"It depends on what one means by 'getting a vaccine'. When one says a vaccine will be out by September, they are referring to proof-of- concepts that show which approaches work or do not work. Beyond that, we are still, opt- imistically, about a year from licensure.\" Mutatis Mutandis This is a parallel danger: virus mutations rendering a vaccine inefficacious. Dr Salisbury says this mechanism isn't prop- erly understood, suggesting there could be \"genetic drift\", like with the seasonal flu, which necessitates adapting the vaccine to keep pace. \"If the bit of the virus critical to vaccine development mutates, we'll have problems,\" he has warned. But Dr Rajni Kant says changes so far have been within an acceptable range\u2014\"not so significant that vaccine efficacy will be affected\". An IISc scientist concurs: \"From a vaccine point of view, mutations are not yet a signif- icant issue. In the crucial S-protein, there's a widely-found mutation at only one posi- tion, not in others.\" For all the competition and 'vaccine one-upmanship', what will prove decisive is cumulative\u2014and collective\u2014science; the sharing of knowledge, resources and tech- nologies. For all the bickering over who gets the first dibs, there has also been an unpre- cedented pooling of ideas\u2014pharma majors Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, for instance, are co-developing an adjuvant vaccine (a substance combined with a vaccine antigen to stimulate a more robust, targeted im- mune response). Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel even hopes \"regulators will approve several vaccines from multiple companies, because no manufacturer can make enough for the planet\". Nowhere is it written, Dr Jameel says, that the \"first vaccine to cross the finish line would be the best or be pro- duced in enough capacity to save the entire world by itself\". The WHO Assembly adopted a unanimous resolution overriding corporate patent rights in the interest of public access to vaccines. A good start, but as Oxfam International noted, even that left \"too many barriers standing in the way of a vaccine for all\". O \"The world will not have enough vaccines for everyone if India is not part of the process,\" says WHO's chief sci- entist Soumya Swaminathan.

The government hospital offers one last avenue to life: it's authorised to conduct Convalescent Plasma Therapy. Infusing ant- ibodies harvested from a survivor's blood... that could give her father a fighting chance. In the bargain between life and death, Convalescent Plasma Therapy has emerged as a new buzzword in the absence of a pre- ventive vaccine or effective treatment against COVID-19. It's not a new idea, though, and has been around since the late 19th century. That was when physiologist Emil von Behring and bacteriologist Kitasato Shibasaburou arrived at the idea of using antibodies present in serum\u2014another blood component\u2014to fight diptheria. \"In fact, the first Nobel Prize was given to Behring (in 1901) for the use of serum to treat diphtheria,\" Dr Arturo Casadevall, a top US immunologist at Johns Hopkins, told Medical News Today. Case reports from the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 indicate use of blood products from recovered patients may have cut fatalities in the severely ill by half. Dr Casadevall is now a steering figure in the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project, in which 57 institutions are collabo- rating. Early results from clinical trials on 12,000 patients had, by late May, offered a modicum of certainty on one crucial aspect: safety of use. A handful of other countries too are at the clinical trial stage, but the jury is still out on whether it will be a game- changer in fighting the deadly virus. The treatment involves transfusing the blood plasma of a recovered patient into another patient. Plasma is the liquid part of your blood, 55 per cent of its total volume\u2014 yellowish in colour when separated, it holds the blood cells in suspension, and carries cells, proteins, minerals, blood-clot- ting factors and antibodies. That last ele- ment offers the rationale behind turning it into an instrument of therapy: the blood plasma of recovered patients contains sig- nificant levels of neutralising antibodies that, if transfused into the blood of a se- verely affected patient, can potentially strafe the virus out of existence. The centu- ry-old treatment\u2014which has shown some results in treating measles, chickenpox and rabies over the decades\u2014thus deigns to bec ome part of the COVID-19 narrative. A fortnight before India crested 2 lakh cases, with the first signs of a post-opening up spurt staring us in the face, the health ministry gave the green light for clinical tri- als to assess the safety and efficacy of plasma therapy. And the IICMR launched a mul-ti-centre clinical trial in 21 hospitals across India\u2014to be done on 452 patients\u2014to find out whether plasma therapy can be recom- mended as a standard cure for COVID-19. Does the established world of medicine look askance at it? Not very much on the- ory\u2014it's the turning of it into praxis that's still a question. Experts point out that it's too early to dub plasma therapy as a 'silver bullet' as it's yet to be put through the litmus test of randomised controlled trials to prove its efficacy to treat any infectious disease. Dr S.K. Sarin, head of the Delhi government's COVID-19 panel, expresses this qualified 'opti- scepticism' when he says at this junc- ture the therapy can only be seen as a short-term emergency aid until definitive treatments are found. \"I would say it's an exp erimental therapy. We are still in the pro- cess of finding out whether it's good or bad. But the scientific basis of plasma therapy is very robust,\" says Dr Sarin, who also heads the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS). Dr Anoop Kumar, a key member of the task force for plasma therapy set up by the Kerala government, too says more trials are needed. \"It was used earlier with many diseases: incl- uding MERS, SARS and Ebola. But no ran- domised controlled studies have been done. It's not a magical bullet for sure. There's clin- ical evidence but it has to be properly grounded in trials,\" says Dr Kumar, who was the first one to submit the protocol for plasma therapy to ICMR. States like Delhi, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are keen to go ahead with the therapy and have some positive results to OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 81 Plasma is the liquid part of blood, 55 per cent of its total volume\u2014yellow- ish in colour when separated, it holds the blood cells in suspension. COVID-19 SPECIAL 82 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020show too. However, the Union health min- istry has said the treatment should be done only on trial basis and warned against ind- iscriminate use. Delhi's LNJP , one of the first government hospitals to get the nod from ICMR, has already undertaken 20 clinical trials. \"The results have been enc- ouraging so far,\" says J.C. Passey, former medical director, LNJP . The largest Covid hospital in the capital, LNJP has already treated over 2,500 patients. In Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Medical College, Jaipur, too, the trials have shown promise, as they proceed under a protocol set by ICMR and with the permission of the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI), the sanctioning authority for blood/blood products. \"So far, we have conducted three successful plasma therapies and all of them are showing improvement in their clinical state, oxygen saturation and d-dimer levels,\" says Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS. The d-dimer is a protein in the blood; a four-fold spike is strong predic-tor of mortality. But the risks are being discussed too. Reports of a doctor's death in UP and ano- ther from Maharashtra after infusion of plasma have cast a shadow on the prospects of the therapy. Experts, however, say more conclusive studies are needed to correlate the deaths and the treatment to rule out the post hoc fallacy. \"It may be a coincidence and may have happened even without plasma therapy. We do not have strong cor - relative evidence. Plasma is given only to fit candidates,\" says Passey. Patients with ext-ensive co-morbidities such as heart prob- lems, uncontrolled diabetes or cancer patients are not selected for the trial. That brings up the question of the eligibil- ity criteria of donor and receiver. Experts say the donors need to have tested positive for COVID-19 and then completed two to four weeks without any symptoms. In terms of the receiver, there's a debate about when a patient must receive plasma. Dr Sarin rec- ommends that it be administered before the patient goes onto the ventilator. He explains that the virus attacks in three stages\u2014in stage one, it multiplies; in stage two, the inf- ection spreads to the lungs; the last stage sees organ failure. \"Plasma therapy should not wait till the third stage. It's good to give in the early stages so you can protect other organs and avoid injury. The basic idea of plasma therapy is to reduce the viral load and stop organ failure,\" he says. Dr Anoop Kumar also stresses on timing: \"You have to infuse the plasma in proper time. So availa- bility must be ensured.\" That last has not yet been a bottleneck, says Dr Passey. \"There's no scarcity of donors; most survivors are willing to donate plasma as their moral res- ponsibility. We have a reserve of plasma from 700 donors,\" he adds. Doctors also cite the fact that plasma therapy is relatively eco- nomical: a donor weighing 70 kg can donate 800 ml of plasma. However, Dr Kumar says the therapy needs to score more on the efficacy part. \"None of the trials has shown any potential risks, but it hasn't shown any promising efficacy either. Not having a risk is not an argument to use a drug. We should be able to establish its effectiveness as well, either in terms of mortality benefit or in terms of thwarting complications,\" he says. Timing, he reiterates, is crucial to fine-tune our understanding. \"In a majority of cases, the therapy is being used after the patient lands on a ventilator in bad shape. It may not work in those cases.\" Tushar Mehta, tragically, was among those\u2014he was too far gone by the time plasma was adminis- tered.

You won't need a mask while jogging or riding a bike if you're exercising with no one around. But it's good to carry one just in case. If it's difficult to breathe through a mask when running or doing other strenuous physical activity, find uncrowded trails or times to exercise when you won't encounter others.

OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 85from ideologies that range from the Alt Right to anarcho- capitalists to the radical Far Left, some of these opposites getting their feed from the very same disseminators. Far- left conspiracists quote the far-right Zero Hedge, and are often found on Reddit mixing it up with QAnonists, who insist that Trump was made president by the US military to save the country from a ring of paedophilic Satanists, which includes the eponymous Mr Gates. In India, conspiracy theories that target China as having engineered and released the neocoronavirus are being plugged by several TV newschannels, and websites such as Great Game India. Coronacrisis spin-doctoring is not going to go away, because COVID-19 is being used to reset Sino-US and Sino-India relations, and state-sponsored conspiracy theories have become part of the arsenal. In a sense, conspiracy theories are now born and propagated in plain sight as 'infodemics' with explicit statal purpose, their purveyors no longer visionary, echoic cabals but auditable government departments. Fake news-busters are not built to deal with this\u2014and, sometimes, fact-checkers are conspiracy theorists themselves. BLOOMBERG Quint reported that in late-February, \"a little-known division of the US State Department, the Global Engagement Center, or GEC, said the Russian government had pushed the Gates rumour. On May 8, the GEC said it had identified a network of fake Twitter accounts being used to spread disinformation, this time on behalf of China.\" The problem with the GEC is that it is wedded to the Trump administration, which has been try - ing on overdrive to pin the coronacrisis on China (and, just as a bonus, on Russia). The GEC was a tiny division of the US State Department with a pointed mandate to \"direct, lead, synchronise, integrate and coordinate efforts of the Federal Government to recognise, understand, expose and counter foreign state and non-state propa- ganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining or influencing the policies, security or stability of the United States, its allies, and partner nations\". In pursuit of this mandate, the GEC has built up a history of carrying out disin- formation, often photoshopping images to suit its purpose. After it fingered Russia and China for disseminating misin-formation (which charge Facebook has actively disputed), it proposed to the Trump administration that its budget for 2021 be doubled to $138-million. And Trump is said to be amenable to the thought. Conspiracy theories live on despite\u2014and in many cases, because of\u2014government denial. Governments denied con- spiracy theories by reflex, because most conspiracy theo-ries were acridly anti-government. Today, however, aside from an unravellable welter of non-state conspiracism, what we have are, seemingly, conspiracies by state actors about conspiracies by other state actors! There exists a conspiracy theory that the term \"conspir - acy theory\" was invented by the CIA in 1967 in a dispatch COVID-19 SPECIAL titled \"Psych\" (for 'psychological operations'), sent out by a unit named \"CS\" (for 'clandestine services') The New York Times obtained this document\u2014which is real\u2014through the Freedom of Information Act. But an Ngram viewer accessed through Google Books shows that the term was born in 1874. Then again, a deep search of its origins led to a letter in the correspondence section of the New York Times dated January 11, 1863, that mentioned\u2014vis-\u00e0-vis England taking the side of the South in the Civil War\u2014the \"right-about-face movement of the English Press and public, which is most readily accounted for on the conspiracy theory\". (It is par - ticularly delicious that a conspiracy involving the press is at the heart of the first mention of a conspiracy theory.) In truth, though, the seeds of a conspiracy mindset had been sowed during the Anti-Masonic Party's 1931 conven- tion where Freemasonry came in for a walloping. It's another matter that the conspiratorial Freemasons carried on but the anti-conspiracy Anti-Masonic Party, which was founded by a lapsed Mason, imploded and disappeared seven years later. Wheels within wheels. It was a fecund time for theories, in general, that would lead on to both great sociological ideas and great intellec- tual presumptions in the 20th century: murder theory was born in 1867, suicide theory in 1871, blackmail theory in 1874, and abduction theory in 1875. (Source: Conspiracy Theory: The Nineteenth-Century Prehistory of a Twentieth-Century Concept, from Conspiracy Theories and the People Who Believe Them; Joseph E. Uscinski; OUP; 2018). It would take nearly a century for the term 'conspiracy the-ory' to come into frequent usage. It gained quotidian pop- ularity in the mid-1950s, taking off steeply during the anti-establishment UFO hysteria, and never quite halting its ascendance in the decades that followed. Today, the term roams unchecked worldwide, and is, indeed, championed\u2014if as an upstart cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\u2014as a valid expression of people's political scepticism and even democratic impulse. 86 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020ventional wisdom is sober presenta- tion by a conventionally respectable face. Luc Antoine Montagnier, 2008 Nobel laureate in physiology or medicine, endorsed the conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 is human-made and went public claiming that its genome has ele- ments of both the HIV retrovirus, which he had discovered, and the malaria germ. Both claims are deeply questionable, but the theo- ries themselves are now embedded in layperson and quasi-scientific circles. The fact that Montagnier has earlier supported anti-vaxxers and claimed that DNA emits \"elec- tromagnetic waves\" has done noth- ing to diminish his oracular stature. Another sort of conventional wis- dom is that the coronacrisis is a 'plandemic' (a portmanteau of 'plan' and 'epidemic')\u2014the belief that it was designed by a shadowy cabal of US health experts and vac-cine manufacturers. The 26-min- ute video that hardsells this idea is a study in the craft of making docu-mentaries: polished, low-key, with entirely believable (if unqualified) interviewer and interviewee (whom the NYT called a \"discred- ited scientist\" in a study of the social-media virality of the video). While the Plandemic video is slick, its USP is that it is that rare thing\u2014a product that hit a starved and cha-otic market, more by accident than by intent, at just the right time. From the time that it was launched to million-views reactions in the social media on May 4, to its banning by Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and Twitter for content-falsity, to its resurgence through a rash of smaller sites such as BitChute and Brighteon, every move to shut it down has only helped it to keep going. Plandemic employs a rhetorical technique known as the \"Gish Gallop\", after the US creationist-bio-chemist Duane Gish, who often successfully buried Darwinists under avalanches of rapid-fire factoids in the final two decades of the 20th century. Plandemic's gallop cannot be halted by conventional means of countering with hard-science facts. In effect, its narrative about the COVID-19's cabalistic roots has, like the most enduring of mod-ern-day conspiracy theories\u2014former BBC sports reporter David Icke's idea of a global reptilian elite, aliens squirelled away in Area 51, that Paul McCartney is dead (and Elvis is not), that the moon landings were shot in a studio\u2014probably come to stay at a slow but permanent boil. OThat the word 'conspiracy' is derived from the Latin con- spirare ('to breathe together') is seen as a good thing. Both the Left and the Right view conspiracy theories as essentially anti-establishmentarian: valid in principle and correct in con- tent. But belief in the same things means that ideologies will be diluted, adulterated or altogether dispensed with. Conspiracism is now defined severally as a mindset, a pre- disposition, a need to see conspiracies behind everything, innocuous and ostentatious, personal and public, secret and declassified. But conspiracism remains poorly defined. There are those who, like the historian Karl Popper, conflate conspiracy theory with pseudoscience and superstition about \"powerful men or groups whose wickedness is respon- sible for all the ills we suffer from\". The opposite camp thinks of conspiracy theories as fairly reasonable responses to modern life and its unprocessability. This camp also believes that, given time and air, most conspiracy theories eventually turn into conventional wisdom.

He let off a tweetstorm accusing the US of using its military attendees at the 2019 Military World Games to spread the virus to the Huanan seafood wetmar - ket, where the source of the outbreak was eventually traced. This conspiracy theory, in turn, set off Trump's by-now-infa- mous takedown during a White House presser of the \"Chinese virus\", and his series of anti-China trade threats that has now cul- minated in a bilateral faceoff between the world's two leading economies. Bioweapon In a survey in April 2020, the Pew Research Center reported that \"nearly three-in-ten [Americans] (29%) say it most likely was cre- ated in a lab\". Some 23 per cent of adult Americans believe the neocoronavirus was intentionally developed in a lab, while an-other 6 per cent say it was accidentally invented. GMOs In an article published in early March 2020 in the Italian newspaper Il Manifesto, an attor - ney named Francesco Bilotta blamed GM crops, claimed falsely that GM crops cause genetic contamination, allowing viral prolifer - ation and interspecies transmission. Researchers debunked the claim as \"scien- tific absurdity\". Indeed, it's almost inescapa- ble that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) will play a big role in the COVID-19 vaccine solution. Covid doesn't exist \u00dcberconspiracists like David Icke and Alex Jones of InfoWars are peddling the idea that COVID-19 is no worse than the common flu and is an enchaining ploy by the globalist elite. It has gained trac- tion in India, among liberals, the Left and the Right, because of the country's notable deathcount deficit. Deep State ploy A global Deep State would make for a borderless Illuminati with a remarkable confluence of intent and purpose, which is why this idea might sound ext reme. In the US's case, the Deep State is exemplified not by Donald Trump, a practising capitalist himself, but by Dr Anthony Fauci, the (mildly reb ellious) face of Trump's neocorona- virus response. The Far Right believes Fauci is working with Hillary Clinton to discredit Trump by causing an eco- nomic collapse. For the Euroright, it's German chancellor Angela Merkel. India's Deep State, the radical Left beli- eves, exists as a part-and-parcel of the incumbent government. Big pharma plot A few major pharmaceutical manufacturers will make millions from the vaccine, but most pharma companies currently engaged in vaccine research will bite the dust. The anti-pharma narrative has been written by anti-vaxxers (for the uninitiated: those against vaccination, a goodly number)\u2014and they have notable support from Greeners, Right Libertarians, and the Far Right that is militantly leading anti-lockdown protests in the US. Alien organism British-Sri Lankan astrobiologist Chandra Wickramasinghe believes COVID-19 arrived in a meteor-fall in northeast China on October 14, 2019. The theory caught on in the global community of UFOlogists, already primed by the appearance of the strange, cigar-shaped extrasolar object, the 'Oumuamua', in October 2017. Wickramasinghe also insists that SARS originated in space. Since 1979, ever since he co-wrote the book Diseases from Space with Fred Hoyle, he has been trying to establish that the flu and the com- mon cold have extraterrestrial origins.COVID SPAM SIGHTED COVID-19 SPECIAL OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 8788 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020 IS SOCIALISM THE VACCINE? THE world, irrespective of the political ideologies of its constituent ruling dispensations, has been brought to its knees by COVID-19. But the fight against this com- mon enemy has shown that efficient administrations\u2014and not political principles\u2014have had an edge. On the shortlist of countries that have experienced remarkable success are Vietnam, Cuba, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. The first two are Communist-ruled, the rest are not. In each, however, it's efficiency at the top that has been vital. A cul-ture of according primacy to healthcare matters every - where\u2014a key factor in this fight is the robustness of public healthcare systems. Even in China, the chief strategy was early detection, followed by free treatment and care to any - one with an infection. Indeed, it tested ten million Wuhan residents at the height of the pandemic there and put the city under total lockdown. Result: Wuhan is now infection free. Private healthcare systems have been found wanting, especially in India, and have not been at the forefront in the fight against the virus. It may be true that the socialist approach to governance brings greater focus on public healthcare and social sup- port systems. But an inefficient socialist/communist dispensation could be worse than an efficient capitalist approach that has focused on public healthcare. In India, we have a point of analogy\u2014partial though it is, because states do not have total policy autonomy during epidemics. That's Kerala, which has a Communist-led government right now, and has had one for 33 of its 63 years of exist-ence.

Kerala's old object of infatuation, Russia, is flailing meanwhile\u2014partly under what BloombergQuint called \"an authoritarian regime that dislikes bad news\". A microbe has outwitted President Putin's helmsmanship: from among the lowest caseloads in March, Russia soared to world number two (nearly 5 lakh cases), till it was replaced by Brazil. The 75th Victory Day Parade\u2014the mili-tary showpiece commemorating Nazi Germany's capitula-tion to the Soviet Union\u2014scheduled to be held later this month might hand it the silver yet again. A dizzy, sobering case of hubris, helped along by inexperience with pandemics and an insufficiently funded/reformed health sector. The talking points now: allegations of fudged mortality rates (still among the lowest) and a new Russian drug, Avifavir, to restore public confi-dence. For a picture of nationalistic bravado and chest-thumping denialism, however, Alexander Lukashenko next door in Belarus needs an honourable mention. President since 1994, the ex-Sov iet soldier has sought to dismiss COVID-19 SPECIAL OPINION corona \"psychosis\" by mouthing a string of gems\u2014saying \"the tractor and fields will heal everyone\", that ice hockey is \"better than antiviral medication\", and asking his people to \"wash their hands with vodka\". No lockdown, no border sealing, and (even if fudged) among East Europe's highest caseloads; the situation is being called a 'viral Chernobyl'. But let's go away from the mavericks and loo k at four 'good' case-studies, country-wise, to appreciate the variety of ways in which leadership can affect an epidemic's passage (for a continent that merits separate treatment, see la Am\u00e9rica, Going South).... New Zealand The expeditious and calmly fervent reac- tion of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to the Christchurch shoot- ing a year ago epitomised a leader who seemed almost a perfect fit for a crisis. The compassionate messaging of March 2019 affirmed New Zealand's commitment to remain a liberal and free country that stood against hate-filled ideologies\u2014it's the same spirit she took to the COVID-19 battle. New Zealand managed to meet the goals of mandatory quarantines, country -There was a touch of authoritarian surveillance in Vietnam's strategy, but the difference with more 'demo - cratic' nations wasn't much.

Besides, it called on nearly 28,000 medical students who, under supervision, offered door-to-door assistance across the country and hands-on care to those who contracted any sort of pulmonary infection. Cuba also made headlines with its 'medical internationalism'\u2014sending doctors and sup-port staff to crisis-hit Italy. Also integral to reducing the num- ber of deaths globally\u2014from Wuhan onwards\u2014is a Cuban antiviral drug, Interferon alfa-2b. The Canadian pharma major BetterLife is now en route to taking up this 30-year-old Cuban invention for trial and mass production\u2014medicine sans frontiers and ideologies, if you like. South Korea Here we have a swift response that stood out as an exem-plar of the key principles of crisis management. It was evi-dent that South Korea had begun stockpiling coronavirus wide lockdown and social distancing without being too draco-nian about it. Some blips were seen along the way\u2014including eager mobs outside a burger store chain and a trip to the beach by the health minister! But, on June 8, New Zealand cleared its last active case, and with no new cases for over a fortnight, it's geared to ease all restrictions. The good news prompted \"a little dance\" around the lounge by the PM, as she herself put it. Still, Ardern was holding off firmly against open- ing up a 'travel bubble' with even Australia, saying the latter was still grappling with cases! Cuba For a country nicknamed 'El Cocodrilo', there's one thing Cuba is not: that's being cold-blooded when it comes to human health. Its renowned free public healthcare system is in the limelight again, leading the fight against COVID-19 with much aplomb. Cuba has the highest ratio of physicians to pop-A grim shadow stalks the Andes, playas and Pampas\u2014the continent is \"losing its battle against coronavirus\", CNN reported on June 7. WHO calls it \"the new Covid epicentre\". With good reason: 1.2 million cases, over 60,000 deaths\u2014 amid soaring food prices. But South America offers an illuminat - ing, if frequently tragic, case-study of how political ideology can interface with pandemic control: a full panoply that defies gener - alisations. The most flagrant violator? Of course, Brazil's army - man-turned-strongman Jair Bolsanaro, a \"polarising and controversial\" figure who comes closest to fitting the description of a far-right despot. The Lancet called him \"the biggest threat\" for Brazil; an opposition MP con- curred, saying: \"We've unfortunately discovered that the virus's main ally and best friend is the president.\" Brazil now is second on world charts, with nearly 7 lakh cases and over 36,000 deaths. In stark contrast, President Alberto Fernandez's comparatively decisive Peronist government in Buenos Aires has seen perennial rival Argentina score higher on the responsiveness index (concerns about testing and data quality notwithstand-ing): to the tune of 22,000 cases and around 650 deaths. Mexico, polar south to a Trumpian 'North' ideal, has been a study in contrasts. President Lopez Obrador asked, with culti-vated casualness, what \"pandemics can do to us\" and also shook hands with a drug lord's mum\u2014but Mexico also rolled out a comprehensive response plan in January, ahead even of WHO's declaration of the pandemic. But, despite being the first 'Latam' nation to use a mathematical model to map/predict the disease, systemic weaknesses and pol-icy gaps have left its leftist government red-faced. With 1,14,000 cases and upwards of 13,500 deaths, a gradually-easing lock - down likely means more blushes ahead. Peru too is struggling, despite a responsive centrist leader in President Martin Vizcarra and one of the earliest lockdowns. Its case graph mirrors India's: now inching close to 2 lakh, with infection reaching even interior Amazonian communities. So do other factors\u2014a large informal economy with severe income inequalities forcing people into poor observance, a \"severely underfunded\" and decentralised health-care, even a balcony show five days before India. Costa Rica is poor too\u201416th in the world in fact\u2014but has one of the lowest Latin American Covid mortality rates (0.2 deaths per lakh). Why? A robust democracy, unified healthcare with universal coverage, and a centre-left president in Carlos Quesada\u2014a 40-year-old journalist and political scientist, pro-gay rights, serious about the environment, quite the antithesis to Bolsanaro. Chile has recovered politically from the Pinochet era, but has its first right-wing president since him in Sebastian Pinera\u2014a billionaire with interests in banking, aviation, media and a publicity hound nightclub-owner for a brother. But, down the line, there are stark income disparities. Result: 1.3 lakh cases and food riots. (The new global popularity of quinoa as health food has led to that staple grain being diverted to exports from all Andean countries.) By contrast, Uruguay too has a centre-right president in Luis Lacalle Pou, but regis- ters only 845 cases and 23 deaths. Then there's Venezuela\u2014that other US bugbear, where Nicolas Maduro, operating with a $15 million US bounty hanging overhead, presides over a Communist lodestar-turned-red dwarf. Stuck between a crude oil-shocked economy and wider socioeconomic crises, it has recorded scarcely-believable (and widely dis-missed as under-reported) pandemic figures: the 28 million-strong country has apparently had just 2,300 infections and 22 deaths.

It was able to provide close to 10,000 tests per day when the infection rate started to climb, and supplemented it with a mobile app that allowed citizens to keep themselves con- stantly updated. Despite the fiasco over the Shincheonji cult, Patient No. 31 and threats of recrudescence, the coun-try is on the ball, as it were\u2014even if 50 new cases reported on June 6 have sparked a debate on whether lockdown restrictions were eased too soon. Vietnam Vietnam and China share a land border stretching about 1,444 km. With a population of 95 million and a relatively low per capita income, Vietnam is an outlier success story. It has had only 329 cases and no reported deaths so far. The country is beginning to lift the strict lockdown measures it imposed in February, reopening restaurants and barber shops last week. It has yet to generate the global applause many other nations have received, perhaps only because Vietnam does not fit the political narrative required for a success story. There was a touch of authoritarian surveillance built into its control strat-egy, but the difference with more 'democratic' countries tack - ling the pandemic was not much\u2014either in degree or in kind\u2014and there was wide social consensus for the same. RESPONSIVENESS begins, well, in the beginning. Look at Kerala: its efforts to address the pandemic started as early as January. As The Guardian noted, on January 20, K.K. Shailaja, the state's health minister, read about \"a dangerous new virus spreading in China\" and enquired if Kerala needed to be on guard. Result: it was combat-ready \"by the time the first case arrived from Wuhan on January 27\". Its signature moves: participatory contact tracing, a supportive quarantine for nearly 2 lakh people, feeding and supplying provisions to some 87.28 lakh ration card holders and 1,50,000 migrant labourers, daily public dissemination of information, and a hands-on health minister, out in the field. The approach was empa-thetic and grassroots-oriented, not one driven top down. In a country of India's scale and inequities, a bottom-up approach that ensures economic and social security also proved the best pandemic shield. \"There's no playbook for leadership when the stakes are high, no playbook for what must be done in the face of a 21st century pandemic,\" leadership consultant Mark Nevins wrote in Forbes. An inclusive, cohesive society, one not polarised on ideological, racial, ethnic, or reli-gious faultlines, cannot harm the cause though. Both finally come down to biological security\u2014life itself. A lot of focus has now shifted to Africa, an understudied conti- nent where COVID-19 has affected all countries by now\u2014 and Congo battles it as part of a \"triple threat\", alongside a recrudescent Ebola outbreak and measles. Africa is largely caught between a picture of stark leadership deficit and a vulnerable populace. At one end, Tanzanian President John Magufuli ridicules testing kits, saying even \"a goat and a pawpaw\" (papaya tree) had tested posi-tive. At the other, a French scientist said on TV, \"If I can be provocative, shouldn't we be doing this study in Africa...\", prompting outrage across La Francophonie and beyond. Among the angry decrials: the Ivorian foot-ball star Didier Drogba memorably proclaiming that Africans are \"not guinea pigs\". Racism, of course, is alive and well on other continents too. To face down such an unprecedented assault on human security as COVID-19 represents, what one needs is collaborative, people-ori-ented leadership\u2014and a Trumpesque spirit may not ensure that security in either a medical sense or a social one. No country in the world matches the US's nearly 2 million cases and upwards of 1.1 lakh deaths. O Havana92 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020 THE term coronavirus entered the scientific litera- ture with little fanfare in 1968, when a short news item appeared in the journal Nature. A letter had been received from a group of virologists, suggesting the name for a recently discovered class of viruses causing mild human respiratory infections. A couple of years earlier, a new group of viruses had been identified in the nasal secre- tions of persons suffering from the symptoms associated with common colds. David Tyrrell at Britain's Common Cold Research Unit in Salisbury and Dorothy Hamre at the University of Chicago had independently managed to grow the new virus in the laboratory. The strain 229E, isolated by Hamre in 1966, yielded the now-famous image, visual- ised under the electron microscope by Tyrrell and June Almeida in 1967. In cross-section, the approximately circu-lar image revealed a spiky exterior with uniform projec-tions, a corona or halo, from which the virus derived its name. The new virus seemed to be the cause of a significant number of common colds, which until then had been thought to be almost entirely caused by a different class of viruses, the rhinoviruses. A relatively benign, new infectious agent did not really attract a great deal of attention in the world of biomedical research. Over 35 years were to pass before the coronavirus bared its fangs. In late 2002, reports of a new and life-threatening respiratory infection emerged from Guangdong province of China. At the end of February 2003, a hospital in Hanoi requested help from the WHO to study the case of a patient with an unusual, influenza-like infection. Dr Carlo Urbani, a specialist in infectious dis-eases, arrived in Hanoi. He quickly realised a new and viru-lent infection was emerging and set in motion the appropriate public health response. Three weeks later, on March 29, 2003, Dr Urbani died in Bangkok, of the infec-tion contracted in Hanoi. Five healthcare workers died shortly thereafter. By the time the spread of infection was halted, 774 people had died out of a total of 8,098 infected persons. ( https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/fs-sars.html). A truly extraordinary scientific effort, coordinated by the WHO, was mounted by a worldwide network of laborato- ries, primarily across Europe and the US, to understand the coronavirus. A full genome sequence became available as early as May 2003. In a tribute to Carlo Urbani, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, on May 15, 2003, noted, \"In some ways, the SARS outbreak in Hanoi is a story of what can go right, of public health's coming before politics\". But with that first SARS epidemic ending quickly, with it the coronavirus too faded from public view...for a handful of years. It swam back into the spotlight briefly in 2007-2008, with the outbreak of infection in the Middle East. The disease was named after the region, as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and the causative agent was P . BALARAMCOVID-19 SPECIAL WHY DOES SCIENCE COME LAST?

But 17 years after Carlo Urbani's death, a new coronavirus strain, SARS-CoV-2, now has much of the world locked down\u2014a public health crisis of unprecedented magnitude. The lessons of the 2003 epidemic have been forgotten. Politics has determined public health responses. Witness the dominant role of China in determining the WHO's initial response to the outbreak in Wuhan, and the increasingly antagonistic attitude of the US to international organisa-tions\u2014capped by President Donald Trump's announcement of American withdrawal from the WHO. Ironically, in the aftermath of SARS (and with news dominated by the US inva- sion of Iraq), Barry Bloom of Harvard University had touched on precisely this aspect in the May 2003 issue of Science: \"In a world...increasingly angry at the US, the lesson here is that it is time to support a global war on disease. The US should be investing efforts and funds to strengthen health structures in countries around the world. If we were to help train experts in epidemiology and surveillance, strengthen laboratories in key regions and link them to the best labs in this country and around the world, and support WHO, we would help to create a true global health network. This investment would protect our country and every other against global epidemics, save millions of lives, and change the US image from one of self-interest to one of human interest\". IN 2003, WHO had emerged as the key protector of global health. Today, the novel coronavirus has exposed how international power struggles can render such organisations irrelevant. The political leadership in many countries has been found wanting too, with responses that sometimes seemed poorly thought out, leading to chaotic situations. The virus has exposed the cavalier approach to public health even in the developed world. The spectacle of ever-inflating defence budgets and declining emphasis on health and social secu-rity must concern those who determine the course of pub-lic policy. The misplaced priorities of governments have been brutally exposed. Many world leaders have displayed a unique combination of arrogance and ignorance; a combi- nation invincible in political arguments, but woefully inad-equate in confronting the forces of nature. The general public, caught in an unanticipated crisis, has been left learning the new vocabulary. Terms like 'social dis-tancing', 'flattening the curve', 'sanitising' (a term hitherto reserved for security operations) and R0 (a mathematical descriptor of viral infectivity) now roll off the tongues of most educated people, who a few weeks ago would have had little interest in viral disease. Tongue-twisters like hydroxychloro-quine find their way into the speeches of the US President, albeit with a little slurring. Our Supreme Court is now able to weigh in on the issue of middle-seat occupancy in planes\u2014 with a sudden, but touching, interest in public health. Viruses, vaccines and drugs are suddenly centrestage, with the world waiting impatiently for science to deliver a solution. It is this very science\u2014the acquisition of basic, fundamental knowledge absolutely essential for practical solutions\u2014that has been neglected and downgraded in India over the past several years. The catchy phrase 'trans- lational research' and related slogans like 'bench to bed- side' have forced researchers to work in 'fundable' areas, determined by agencies that are under governmental pres-sure to make extravagant claims for the outcome of funded projects. A heavy price will be, and is being, paid for inade- quate support of fundamental studies in disciplines like immunology, virology and many allied disciplines of cellu-lar and chemical biology. The sudden flurry of calls by gov - ernment agencies for proposals to do 'Covid research' in ridiculously short timescales, with unrealistic goals, is patently a kneejerk reaction to the current situation. The virus is a formidable foe. We might do well to remem- ber Michael Corleone's sage advice in the sequel to The Godfather: \"Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer\". Scientists, diverted from their favourite problems to the task of attacking the coronavirus, will be confronted with a formidable body of scientific literature that needs to be assimilated. The international scientific response to both the 2003 SARS outbreak and the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been staggering, with the full power of modern technologies being focused on understanding the virus. Yet a solution does not seem within our grasp. In an March 23 editorial in Science, the jour - nal's chief editor Holden Thorp had good advice: \"When science addressed the HIV/AIDS crisis, it took years of careful virology, drug development, and epidemiology. The global scientific assault on COVID-19 is faster, and as I see the research that comes to Science and that appears on preprint servers, I am hopeful that science will deliver on this challenge, too. But I worry that engendering false hope will cause complacency that will deprive us of the time needed to find a lasting solution. And I worry about lasting damage if science overpromises. Let's underpromise. Let's overdeliver\". There are no drugs or vaccines in sight, even in the US and Europe, as everyone moves to an 'unlocked' world. Politicians and their advisors are already preparing us for this future, by pronouncing that the coronavirus is here to stay and that the world must get ready to coexist with the latest addition to the pantheon of viruses. Nature, as always, has the last word. A constant exposure to microbial pathogens can enhance the level of human immune compe- tence. In the words of Joshua Lederberg, one of the high priests of microbiology: \"Paradoxically, improvements in sanitation and vaccination sometimes make us more vul-nerable because they leave the larger human herd more innocent of microbial experience.\" O THE AUTHOR, A BIOCHEMIST AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE, IS WITH NCBS, BANGALORE Chromosomes where our DNA resides94 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020Review / ART AND CUL TURE Starting her career with Khichdi: The Movie , Kirti Kulhari has delivered power-packed performances in diverse roles.

One of the pioneers of middle-of-the-road cinema, he passed away after a protracted illness at 90 in Mumbai on June 4. His movies neither looked like hardcore masala ventures of the likes of Manmohan Desai nor the art house cinema championed by Shyam Benegal and others. Instead, he chose to be the Buddha among the storytellers of his time, choosing the middle path traversed by only a few in the film industry.A veritable institution in the art of simplified filmmaking, he churned out an array of whole-some family entertainers, from Saara Akash (1969) and Rajnigandha (1974) to Chitchor (1976) and Baton Baton Mein (1979) without leaning on any superstar. In fact, his films with some of the big stars of the time\u2014Priyatama (1977) with Jeetendra, Chakravyuh and Manpasand (1980) with Dev Anand\u2014failed to click at the box office. It was his collaboration with everyman actors such as Amol Palekar, who played the quintessential middle-class hero in eight of his CINEMA/ OBITUARYOUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 97films, that elevated his status as an auteur extraordinaire with a refined sensibility. Basu da, as his colleagues affectionately called him, excelled in telling stories of common people and their struggles with dollops of subtle wit and humour. The USP of his films was that he did not present any of his heroes as a superman with a traffic-stopping eye candy in his arms, capable of demolishing an army of 40 armed goons at one go without batting an eyelid. Instead, his protag-onist was invariably a middle-class youth with follies and foibles, who was at times upstaged by a smarter adversary. His actors were anything but larger-than-life or over-the-top and looked no different from the man-next-door, someone the audience could instantly relate to. It was the sheer simplicity of his movies that made Basu da's repertoire stand out. He began his career as an illustrator-cartoonist in the now-defunct Blitz tabloid in Bombay before he moved to cinema to work as an assis- tant to director Basu Bhattacharya on Teesri Kasam (1966). In 1969, he began his innings as an independent director with Saara Akash, based on a novel of the same name by littera-teur Rajendra Yadav. It was the year when his iconic Bhuvan Shome and Khwaja Ahamad called Amitabh Bachchan in Saat Hindustani. Moreover, a new sensation called Rajesh Khanna had taken the industry by storm with Aradhana and yet, Basu da's 'small' movie received rave reviews and set the template for his signature style of cinema\u2014no tropes or frills of masala movies that Hindi cinema was notorious for in those days. Basu da went on to make Piya Ka Ghar (1972), Us Paar (1974), (1986), Chameli Ki Shaadi (1986) and a slew of other movies. He also ventured out of his comfort zone by making experimental films such as Ek Ruka Hua Faisla (1986) and Kamla Ki Maut (1989), which under - lined his versatility and control over his craft. There was hardly any filmmaker of his genera- tion as prolific as him in his heyday. During his illustrious career, he directed 40 feature films, including five Bengali movies. Trishanku (2011) was his swan song. He also found time to direct a handful of successful television serials, such as the iconic Rajani (1985), Darpan (1985), Kakaji Kahin (1988) and Byomkesh Bakshi (1993) for Doordarshan. It is to his credit that his heavy workload could never bog him down nor diminish his passion for quality cinema. Considering that the Hindi film industry was under the sway of action-packed multi-starrers, it is remarkable he dared to make such films. For nearly two decades, Basu da argu- ably remained the only successful filmmaker alongside Hrishikesh Mukherjee to buck the trend and make self-deprecatory movies about middle-class society. Basu da's style of filmmaking went on to inspire generations of filmmakers in the dec-ades to come. One could say that Bollywood began to follow his filmmaking template 30 years too late by acknowledging the fact that no star is bigger than the character he plays onscreen. It is a greater tribute to him than all the awards and laurels he deserved, but did not get in his lifetime.

Bond's latest, the topically named No Time To Die, will now release in November (instead of February). Still more serendipitous is the theme: Bond rescues humanity from a pandemic. And, in the most shattering departure ever, Bond is married (what!!!), with a child. Will wife Madeleine (Lea Seydoux) and daughter Mathilde cramp Bond's free-ranging style as a buccaneer of boudoirs? But listen; Daniel, it looks, performs better with responsibility. la dolce vita Smithy Of His Blade Virat Kohli has misgivings about T20's bad habits creeping into one-day batsmanship.

When did we ever think the glamor - ous and good\u2014in tuxedos and gowns, weighed down with stones\u2014would be subject to a walk through a thermal screening doorway? But such are the times: at the Daejong Film Awards in Seoul, actress Jin Seo-yeon, looking as nonchalant as possible, crosses over into a safe zone. But ah, she's not wearing the ubiquitous mask! A minor concession to showbiz?OUTLOOKINDIA.COM JUNE 22, 2020 | OUTLOOK 99 la dolce vita A Victim's Tale We don't know much about Meera Chopra\u2014though she looks inviting enough here, tumbled down on a fine-sanded beach in a swimsuit that bears closer inspec-tion than we are allowed\u2014but the actress has had a traumatic experience at the hands of livid, and criminally stupid, NTR jr fans when she said in a social media chat that she liked Telugu superstar Mahesh Babu, but was ignorant about the junior. Abuse followed, together with threats of assault, morphed photos and curses of coronavirus on her parents. NTR jr, meanwhile, kept up a loud silence. Meera deplores this sick dictatorship of the 'fans', and has reported this to the police. We hope their fetid ardour gets a good shellacking. Never Get Out It's one thing to pose in bikinis\u2014you're well-acquainted with those here\u2014it's another to cavort in workaday lingerie, with its frisson of intimacy, abandon, a whiff of cool, stale, slept-in sheets. That's what Mandana Karimi suggests, as she digs her knees in and tells us that the bed is her favourite place these days. At the height of the Vietnam War in 1969, as American and Vietnamese kids reaped the tragic fruits of a generaton of US politicians' pig-headed folly, John Lennon and Yoko Yono staged their famous bed-ins for universal peace. Mandana here aims for universal love.100 OUTLOOK |JUNE 22, 2020 COVID-19 Rijuta De is a junior doctor at Peerless Hospital and B.K. Roy Research Centre ILLUSTRATION: SAAHIL(Rs 1,500 per test) and is being used more often as cases increase. It gives results in five to six hours. RT-PCR is more expen- sive (Rs 4,500 per test) and can take up to 10 hours to provide accurate results. Both tests are equally good. Positive to Negative I had weakness, chills at night and bouts of high fever\u2014symptoms of COVID-19. This escalated to breathlessness, chest pain and anosmia (loss of smell). I tested positive on April 25. The hospital gave me a separate room and the staff took good care of me. Since no cure has been discovered, there is not much one can do for a COVID-19 patient. Apart from the usual checks, I was on medicines as per the WHO protocol\u2014Vitamin C, antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol. Since I had lost my sense of smell, I couldn't taste food either. It was frustrat-ing at times, but since I was a house physician, I could at least talk to the nurses. And thank god for my smartphone! I was still positive after two weeks, but I knew I would get well. Age was on my side, so it was only a matter of time.. When I did not show any fresh symptoms for more than a week and my chest X-ray showed signs of improvement, I knew I was recovering. Finally, when I did not get a fever for three consecutive days and my vitals were stable, I was allowed to go home, but only on the condition that I would be quarantined for a week. It was relaxing as I was back in an intimate space and my parents and sister were around. On May 26, my result was negative. Flatten The Fear Curve When I joined the hospital after four weeks of treatment and quarantine, I was not forced to join the COVID-19 ward\u2014I made a conscious decision to work there. As a doctor, it's my commitment to serve humanity to the best of my ability, without discriminating among patients. While people do not stimgatise COVID-19 like they do tuberculosis, leprosy or sexually transmitted infections, there is still tremendous fear of the disease. However, to treat a person with coronavirus as if they were untouchable is unacceptable. Indeed, the curve is anything but flattening in India, but unless medical personnel eschew fear, we will not be able to stop the spread of the disease. That motivated me to return to the isolation ward and work for people battling the virus. However, to see people risking their lives being treated like outcastes was shameful. Fortunately, the attacks on health workers and nurses attached to COVID-19 wards have stopped. Cases are rising though\u2014we are getting an average of five patients every day, quite a high number. Unlike before, we are unable to trace the source of the infection. This shows that lockdown rules have been thrown to the wind. With things unlikely to get better soon, we have to step up as a team. Right now, our commitment, willingness and courage matter as much as our MBBS degrees. O (As told to Soumitra Bose)The Biggest Test Oath may seem like a tiny word, but it contains a universe of expectations. To live up to the vows one swears allegiance to is a big challenge. Our leaders, unfortunately, have failed to serve and protect the people of India during the pandemic. I, however, hope I have remained honest to the Hippo- cratic oath I had taken in August 2017. In the past few months, I have faced the biggest test as a doctor. April-May will be engraved in my mem-ories for the rest of my life. I treated patients, tested positive for COVID-19 and emerged from the disease a stronger person. Within three days of testing neg- ative, I was back in the COVID-19 ward at Calcutta's Peerless Hospital. It's been a fortnight since I returned. As patients with other diseases too come to the hospital, the COVID-19 section has been completely isolated. It can be mentally damning to stay so secluded. But that's the nature of our work. As they say, it's the new normal. March Of The Virus From March onwards, we started get- ting patients\u2014both symptomatic and asymptomatic. There was a paucity of testing kits. One day, we admitted an 86-year-old Bengali lady. She suffered from Parkinson's and was weak and feverish\u2014practically bed-ridden. We didn't test her for COVID-19 though. Old people need a lot of attention and I, along with some nurses, looked after her fondly. Unfortunately, we could not save her. Soon, I too started showing symptoms, as did a couple of nurses and other staff attending to the lady. As far as testing is concerned, things have gotten better compared to the initial days of the pandemic. Earlier, we relied on Chinese kits that some-times gave erroneous results. Now we have two types of kits\u2014GeneXpert and RT-PCR. The former is cheaper "}
