Specifically, cancer is the second overall cause of death in the United States. Gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers, are of particular concerns not only because of their high incidence rates, but also because of their high mortality rate, especially in pancreatic and liver cancer patients (1-4). From years 1992-1999, studies revealed that the five-year relative survival rate of colorectal cancer was 62.3% while that of liver cancer was 6.9% and 4.4% for pancreatic cancer. The median survival of liver cancer was 3.5 weeks to 6 months while it was 4 to 6 months for pancreatic cancer (3). With only very poor chemotherapeutic regimens available, pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate among all cancers in the United States, with a less than 5% survival rate 5 years from diagnosis (3). Although several regimens are currently used in clinical trials for hepatocellular carcinoma, there is no FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agent available. The low survival rates for both pancreatic and hepatocellular cancers are attributed to many factors including diagnosis is difficult, the tumor growth is highly aggressive, surgical removal of tumor is of low probability, and the tumor has a high rate of chemotherapy resistance. In one aspect, the present invention provides a composition comprising: i) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; ii) an herbal preparation comprising Scutellaria, Glycyrrhiza, Ziziphus, and Paeonia; and iii) one or more chemotherapeutic compounds. In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating a disease in a mammal in need thereof comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising: i) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; ii) an herbal preparation comprising Scutellaria, Glycyrrhiza. Ziziphus, and Paeonia; and iii) one or more chemotherapeutic compounds. In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of increasing the therapeutic index of cancer therapeutic compounds for the treatment of cancer by administering to a mammal in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and an herbal preparation comprising Scutellaria, Glycyrrhiza, Ziziphus, and Paeonia. In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of relieving side effects of a chemotherapeutic compound in a mammal comprising administering a composition comprising: i) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; ii) an herbal preparation comprising Scutellaria, Glycyrrhiza, Ziziphus, and Paeonia; and iii) one or more chemotherapeutic compounds. In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of improving the quality of life of a mammal undergoing chemotherapy which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more chemotherapeutic compounds and a composition comprising: i) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; ii) an herbal preparation comprising Scutellaria, Glycyrrhiza, Ziziphus, and Paeonia; and iii) one or more chemotherapeutic compounds.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Gemcitabine is the only clinically approved chemotherapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer; however, the response rate in patients to gemcitabine is only 6-11% and the overall survival time is generally 4-6 months. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog with two mechanisms of action, including the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme that converts nucleotide diphosphate to deoxynucleotide triphosphate and that is required for DNA synthesis and that competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate as a fraudulent base in DNA synthesis (3,5-10). With the low response and survival rates of gemcitabine monotherapy, several gemcitabine-combination drug regimens have been tested clinically for improving therapeutic efficacy. These trials include gemcitabine with other commonly used and FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs including CPT-11, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin (11-14). Unfortunately, no satisfactory combination drug regimens have been discovered and an effective regimen for pancreatic cancer is urgently needed. Capecitabine (Xeloda), an oral fluoropyrimidine, is a rationally designed oral prodrug efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and converted to 5-FU, preferentially in neoplastic tissues. It has been approved by the FDA as a first-line chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal and breast cancers with reduced toxicities (15-17). Capecitabine has also shown promising antitumor activity as a single agent in pancreatic cancer (18) and liver cancer (19). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently treated by surgical procedures and chemotherapy. Surgical removal and postoperative therapies may improve the outlook for some patients. Unfortunately, the vast majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma will have unresectable cancers. In late 2007, sorafenib became the first FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agent for HCC. Published Oral multikinase inhibitor sorafenib and vascular endothelial growth factor. Sorafenib prevents tumor growth by combining inhibition in tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. Preclinical studies suggest that sorafenib may offer therapeutic benefits in HCC by blocking Raf-1 signal transduction pathway. Colorectal cancer has been reported to be the third most common cause of death from cancer in the United States (22). Recently, the FDA approved the triple combination use of Oxaliplatin/5-FU/LV as the first-line treatment for patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Oxaliplatin is a synthesized diaminocyclohexane platinum compound, which like cisplatin, causes platinum-DNA adduct formation and destroys the integrity of DNA (23). Other types of chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-FU, CPT-11, are common chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, severe diarrhea has been identified as one of the dose-limiting toxicities among patients treated with chemotherapy. Our studies showed that PHY906, an herbal composition, not only reduced chemotherapy-induced toxicities, including body weight loss and mortality, but it also enhanced the antitumor efficacy of a broad-spectrum of anticancer agents including, but limited gemcitabine/oxaliplatin in pancreatic cancer in vive animal models. The positive results from these preclinical studies demonstrate that PHY906 can be used as an adjuvant for a broad-spectrum of different types of chemotherapeutic agents in anti-cancer therapy. These chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limit to, capecitabine and sorafenib. The cancers include, but are not limited to, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers. The methods of the present invention can be used to improve the quality of life of patients including mammals under chemotherapy. Specifically, this invention relates to the dosing and scheduling of PHY906 in potentiating the therapeutic index of a broad-spectrum of cancer chemotherapeutic agents by the herbal composition PHY906.

No. 11/100,433 filed Apr. 7, 2005; and International Application No. PCT/US2005/040605 filed Nov. 9, 2005, the content of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.Examples Materials and Methods Drug: Sorafenib (Nexavar) was purchased from Bayer HealthCare (Leverkusen, Germany). Capecitabine (Xeloda\u00ae, CAP) was purchased from Roche Laboratories Inc. (Nutley, N.J.). The clinical drug substance of PHY906 (PHY906-6, FDA 165542) with 10% excipient was prepared by Sun Ten Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Taipei, Taiwan). The PHY906 formula is composed of relative weight ratio of 3:2:2:2. Mice: Female BDF-1 mice with body weights between 16 and 20 g (4-6 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Mass.). Male NCr athymic nude mice with body weights between 16 and 20 g (4-6 weeks old) were purchased from Taconic Farms (Garmantown, N.Y.). Preparation of Sorafenib solution: Sorafenib (200 mg/tablet) was dissolved in 5% gum arabic as the vehicle. The final solution contains 30 mg/ml of sorafenib. Preparation of capecitabine solution from capecitabine tablet: Capecitabine (150 mg/tablet) was dissolved in 40 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 5% gum arabic as the vehicle. The final solution contains 36 mg/ml of capecitabine. Preparation of herbal extract from dry powder: The preparation of the herbal extract followed SOP #HERB-001-PHY906. Briefly, one gram of PHY906 dry powder, containing 10% starch excipient, was added to 10 ml of 80\u00b0 C. H2O and incubated at 80\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. The supernatant was separated from the debris by centrifugation (12000 rpm, 10 min) at room temperature. The concentration of PHY906 supernatant was calculated as 90 mg/ml of PHY906 (1 g/10 ml\u00d70.9), based on the dry weight of the dry powder. The herbal extract was stored at room temperature and used within 24 hours. Any residual precipitant that occurred upon standing was vortexed into a suspension and used to treat the animals. Tumor cells: The human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2, human PANC-1 pancreatic cancer, and mouse Colon 38 colorectal cancer cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.). The HepG2 and Colon 38 cell lines were routinely grown in MEME media while the PANC-1 cell line was grown in DMEM media, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were implanted into the left flank of mice. Tumor transplantation from mice to mice was performed when the tumor reached 1500-2000 mm3. Mouse tumor model: Tumor cells (5\u00d7106 cells in 0.1 ml PBS) were transplanted subcutaneously into the left flank of mice. After 14 days, tumor ranging in size from 300-500 mm3 was selected for drug studies. The length and width of the each tumor was measured with sliding calipers. The tumor size was estimated according to the following formula: Tumor size(mm3)=length(mm)\u00d7width(mm)2/2. The studies were conducted and the animals were maintained at the Yale Animal Facility. Antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic agents in the presence or absence of PHY906: A total of 20 tumor-bearing mice were divided into 4 groups (N=5 mice/group): - - 1. Vehicle - 2. PHY906 - 3. Chemotherapeutic agent - 4. PHY906+Chemotherapeutic agent The first day of drug treatment was defined as day 1. PHY906 (500 mg/kg, bid) was administrated orally to the mice 30 min before chemotherapeutic agents at the days indicated. Chemotherapeutic agents were given either intraperitoneally or orally at the dose and schedule indicated. The tumor size, body weight, and mortality of the mice were monitored daily. Mice were sacrificed when the tumor size reached 10% of body weight. Immunohistochemnistry: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue was freshly cut into slices of 4 mm. The sections were mounted on Superfrost slides, dewaxed with xylene, and gradually hydrated. Antigen retrieval was achieved by 0.05% citraconic anhydride buffer (pH 7.4) at 94\u00b0 C. for 1 h. The primary HIF-1, CD31 or VEGF antibodies was diluted containing 1% BSA and 0.5% Tween-20. The primary antibody was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. As a negative control, two slides were processed without primary antibody. Detection took place by the conventional labeled streptavidin-biotin method with alkaline phosphatase as the reporting enzyme according to the manufacturer's instructions. DAB (3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo.) served as chromogen. Afterwards, the slides were briefly counterstained with hematoxylin and aqueously mounted. Statistical analysis and statistical power of the study (24): A random effects model was employed to analyze data from similar dosing animal trials. The PROC MIXED procedure in SAS was used to take into account the correlation among observations collected from the same mouse. The following model was used to analyze the longitudinal data: yijk=tk+(IDtk)+(IPtk)+(IDIPtk)+eijk, where yijk is the relative tumor size of the jth individual with the ith group (no treatment, drug alone. PHY906 alone, and drug+PHY906) at the kth time point, tk is the kth time point, is the baseline time effect (no treatment group), ID and IP are indicator variables for having the drug treatment and the PHY906 treatment, is the drug-specific linear time effect. is the PHY906-specific linear time effect, is the drug-PHY906 synergistic linear time effect, and eijk is the residual (error) term. We assumed that the errors from different individuals are independent, and errors from the same individual at different time points follow the autoregressive model, AR(1), to take into account the fact the observations from the same individual within the same treatment group are more correlated, and the responses from closer time points are more correlated within the same individual. The PROC MIXED in SAS 8.01 was used to perform the statistical analysis. Results (1) Sorafenib Effect of PHY906 in Antitumor Activity of Sorafenib in Murine Colon 38 Bearing BDF-1 Mice To determine whether the combinational use of PHY906 and sorafenib in order to improve anti-tumor activity of sorafenib. Sorafenib at dose of 30 mg/kg (BID, D1-14), in combination with a fixed dose of PHY906 at 500 mg/kg (BID, D1-4 and 8-1), were studied in BDF-1 mice bearing Colon 38 murine colorectal cancer. As shown in FIGS. 1, PHY906 significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of sorafenib in Colon 38 bearing mice. Indeed, the tumor growth was suppressed when mice received the combination of PHY906 and sorafenib. Effect of PHY906 in (a) Antitumor Activity, (b) Blood Vessels, (c) VEGF Level and (d) HIF-1 of Sorafenib the antitumor activity of sorafenib (30 mg/kg, BID, D1-20) in human HepG2 bearing nude mice. As shown in The immunohistochemical stainings on mouse liver indicate that the integrity of tumor blood vessels are destroyed with the combination treatment of PHY906 and sorafenib, as shown in (2) Capecitabine Effect of PHY906 on the Antitumor Activity of Capecitabine in Human Panc-1 Tumor-Bearing Nude Mice PHY906 was previously found to potentiate the antitumor activity of capecitabine in human HepG2 xenografts. An experiment was therefore conducted to study whether PHY906 could enhance the antitumor activity of capecitabine in human Panc-1 xenografts. Total 20 NCr nude mice transplanted with Panc-1 human pancreatic carcinoma cells were divided into 4 groups (N=5 mice/group): Group (A) vehicle control; Group (B) treated mg/kg, bid, day 1-4, 8-11, 15-18, mg/kg, bid, day 1-7, 15-21, and 29-32); and Group (D) treated with bid, day and 29-32). PHY906 was found to enhance the antitumor activity of capecitabine, as shown in All applications, patent, and publications referenced herein are incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual application, patent, and publication was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.
