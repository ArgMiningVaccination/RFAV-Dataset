To qualify, undocumented students must: :: Have attended a Minnesota high school for three years and have graduated from high school or attained the equivalent of high school graduation in Minnesota; :: Provide documentation of having complied with selective service requirements; and :: Provide documentation of having applied to obtain lawful immigration status, if a process for obtaining such status has been established by the federal government. (Note: At the present time this federal process has not been established, therefore such documentation is not currently required) In addition to resident tuition, undocumented students who meet the conditions above may also be eligible to receive a Minnesota State Grant and/ or private scholarships from MnSCU foundations. Contact the financial aid office at the college or university you plan to attend for more information.DEBT OF MNSCU GRADUATES Academic Year 2012-2013 MnSCU % WITH NO DEBTMnSCU % WITH DEBTMEDIAN DEBT FOR THOSE WITH DEBTMEDIAN DEBT FOR ALL Diplomas46% 54%$10,900$2,750 Associate Degree34% 66%$15,819$9,028 Baccalaureate COST Academic Year 2014-2015 MnSCU COLLEGE STUDENTSMnSCU UNIVERSITY STUDENTS INCOME LEVELS FOR GRANT RECIPIENTSAVERAGE 2014-15 STUDENT TUITION COSTAVERAGE 2014-15 STUDENT TUITION to $59,999$2,062$2,671 $60,000 and above$3,134$4,4192014-15 tuition rate for full-time students (30 credits, 15 per term) minus estimated state and Pell grants: Compared to their counterparts at other higher education institutions in Minnesota, more MnSCU students graduate with less or no debt.LOWER TUITION COSTS WITH STATE AND PELL GRANTS Your 2014-2015 Guide To MnSCU 5 Grants You may be eligible to receive federal and state grants of $300 to more than $9,000 per year.

When comparing college costs, financial aid estimates need to be figured into the equation. Below are four different financial aid scenarios that outline 2014-2015 net college costs for full-time MnSCU students with different circumstances and family income levels. New this year: Part-time MnSCU students (enrolled in fewer than 15 credits per term) can now receive Pell Grants and State Grants pro-rated to their enrollment credit level. HOW FINANCIAL AID CAN OFFSET COLLEGE COSTS For all four scenarios above, federal and state grants (which do not need to be paid back) cover a significant part of the cost. Tuition and fees are the only costs paid directly to the college or university. The total costs are estimates that could be much lower, depending on your circumstances. Some families take out a bank loan to pay some costs of college. Costs are for average full-time tuition and fees per year for Minnesota residents. Your 2014-2015 Guide To MnSCU 7Technical Course Options Students who are interested in technical courses may take one technical college level course taught on a college campus as early as grade 10. To be eligible to do so, they must be enrolled in a public school, have a minimum of a \"proficient\" score on the 8th grade Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment (MCA) test for reading and meet the assessment prerequisites set for the course that must be met by all students. If a student successfully completes the technical course with a C or higher, the student can take additional technical courses as long as he or she meets the assessment requirement for those courses. AP and IB Options Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses are offered at many high schools and provide a rigorous curriculum that prepares students to take college level courses. Students who pass an Advanced Placement test or the International Baccalaureate examination with acceptable scores will be awarded college credit at any MnSCU college or university.Post-Secondary Enrollment Options The PSEO program allows high school students to take college courses on a college or university campus or online taught by college or university faculty members. To be eligible to take PSEO courses, high school juniors must be in the upper one-third of their class or earn a score at or above the 70th percentile on a test such as the ACT or SAT. Seniors must be in the upper half of their class or score at or above the 50th percentile on a test such as the ACT or SAT. Many high schools offer PSEO courses through concurrent enrollment, allowing students to take college courses taught by highly qualified high school teachers without having to leave the high school. Under certain circumstances, students in 9th or 10th grade may also be allowed to take concurrent enrollment courses. If you are interested in PSEO, talk to your high school guidance counselor and college/university admissions staff or go to www.mnscu.edu/pseo. Most campuses have deadlines for applications for enrollment in November for spring enrollment and June for fall enrollment. Local school districts also need to be notified by May 1st for fall semester starts. Check with your district and college or university for their specific deadline dates.EARN COLLEGE CREDIT IN HIGH SCHOOL Post-Secondary Enrollment Options (PSEO): Students can get a jump start on earning college credits by taking college courses while they are in still in high school through Minnesota's PSEO program. This program allows students to take college courses tuition free, saving both time and money on completing a college degree. PSEO courses may also fulfill high school course requirements and count toward a high school diploma. 107,100MnSCU STUDENTS TOOK AN ONLINE CLASS IN 2011-2012 www.mnscu.edu 8Study Abroad Explore new countries, meet local residents and learn about their cultures through study abroad programs offered by the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. Programs range from a few weeks to a full semester abroad, and many programs feature volunteer projects in communities and local schools that let you contribute your talents while you learn. You can visit ancient ruins and elegant castles, and learn first-hand about the history of countries such as Italy, England, Denmark, Australia and Mexico. Ask about study abroad information at the colleges or universities that interest you.TRIO Services Help Students Succeed The Federal TRIO Programs are outreach and student services programs designed to identify and provide services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. TRIO programs serve and assist low-income individuals, first- generation college students and individuals with disabilities to successfully enroll and complete academic goals. Services for Students with Disabilities Minnesota State Colleges and Universities all have accessible buildings for students with disabilities, and they provide accommodations to help students who have documented physical and learning disabilities. To learn more, talk with the disability coordinator at the college or university you're interested in attending. Services for Veterans Veterans are welcomed at Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. If you've served in the armed forces, you might be eligible for help with paying for college. Stop by one of the on-campus veterans centers for information, support and assistance. Also, check with the campus financial aid office about benefits from the Minnesota GI Bill.

Minnesota State Colleges and Universities work together to make transferring as easy as possible. All of our 31 state colleges and universities offer all or part of the Minnesota Transfer Curriculum, a 40-credit package of general education courses accepted for transfer to other state colleges and universities, the University of Minnesota, and some private colleges and universities. Plan Ahead to Transfer Successfully Any course has the potential to transfer; however, general education (Minnesota Transfer Curriculum) courses are the most commonly accepted. It is possible that any credits will transfer from one institution to another, but not fulfill the specific requirements of your new degree program. When enrolling at a two-year college with the intention to transfer to a four-year university, it is important to know which degree path is right for you, as associate degree programs vary in transferability. :: Associate in Arts (A.A.) degrees are designed to transfer most readily into most baccalaureate (four-year) majors; however, some baccalaureate majors may require specific pre-major courses that may be taken as part of this degree. :: Associate in Science (A.S.) degrees often transfer into a specific four-year degree major at partnering universities through articulation agreements :: Associate in Fine Arts (A.F .A) degrees often transfer into a specific four-year degree major at partnering universities through articulation agreements. :: Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) degrees, technical diplomas and technical certificates are designed for immediate entry into the workplace and may have more limited transferability. AAS degrees are not designed for transfer to baccalaureate (four-year) degree majors. Note: Please keep in mind that articulation agreements are usually between one two-year college program and one four-year university major. Make sure to find out what university major accepts the college program covered by the agreement as soon as possible. An articulation agreement database is maintained on MnTransfer.org: http//www.mntransfer.org/ students/plan/s_agreements.phpSeek Advice Transfer specialists at each campus can help you with course selection and transfer plans. Talk to a transfer specialist and your academic advisor as early as possible and every semester about your degree plans and about where you wish to transfer. Also be sure to review your degree audit report (DARS) every semester. It will help you track your progress towards completing your current program or major. Visit Transferology www.transferology.com to see how courses at one participating institution are accepted into specific programs or majors at other participating institutions. Transferology also lets you know how standardized exams and military credit transfers into programs or majors. www.mnscu.edu 10CHOOSING A STATE COLLEGE Minnesota state colleges offer associate degrees, the Minnesota Transfer Curriculum (MnTC), certificates and diplomas. The state community and technical colleges have an open admissions policy. This means all you need to enroll is a high school diploma or a GED. If you don't have a high school diploma or GED, you may take a standardized test to be admitted. You can complete two years at a state college and transfer to another college or university, or you can complete a one-year or two-year career program and go to work right away. Either option is a great value. MnSCU tuition costs are the lowest in the state, and are frozen through the 2014-2015 academic year. 66% OF MN RESIDENTS PURSUING AN UNDERGRADUATE CREDENTIAL, ATTEND A MNSCU COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY66% AVERAGE ANNUAL MNSCU COLLEGE TUITION AND FEES FOR A FULL-TIME STUDENT PUBLIC COMMUNITY, TECHNICAL AND COMPREHENSIVE COLLEGES24 $ 5,389 11 Your 2014-2015 Guide To MnSCUAGRICULTURAL AND FOOD INDUSTRIES Agribusiness Service Technician Agricultural Business and Production Agricultural Science and Technology Culinary Arts and Food Service Farm Business Management Floral Design Food Processing Safety Food Sciences Golf Course/Turf Management Horse Husbandry/Equine Business Management Horticulture, Landscaping and Greenhouse Taxidermy Veterinary Technology ARCHITECTURE AND CONSTRUCTION Building Inspection Building/Property Maintenance Cabinetmaking and Interior Finishing Carpentry and Building Trades Concrete/Masonry/Bricklaying Construction Management Drafting -
