DELEGATION Nurse delegation means the action of a nurse to direct competent individuals to perform selected nursing tasks inselected situations pursuant to 655 Iowa AdministrativeCode, Chapter 6, subrule 6.2(5). 6.2(5)\"c\" - Using professional judgment in assigning and del- egating activities and functions to unlicensed assistive person-nel. Activities and functions which are beyond the scope ofpractice of the licensed practical nurse may not be delegated tounlicensed assistive personnel. The decision to delegate to an unlicensed assistive per- sonnel is based on the delegation process; assessment, plan-ning, implementation and evaluation. The delegating nursemust ensure the task/function is appropriate to delegate, theindividual patient/client is appropriate under the right cir-cumstance, the unlicensed assistive personnel is educatedand competent in the task/function, and supervision, com-munication and evaluation are being carried out. There mustbe documentation of the unlicensed assistive personnel'seducation and competency. KEY POINTS FOR DELEGATION The nurse delegating the task/function retains accountability for the process of delegation and mak-ing the decision to delegate. Licensed practical nurses are allowed to delegate within the scope of their practice under the supervi-sion of a registered nurse. Assessment, planning, evaluation and nursing judg- ment cannot be delegated. The nurse and the unlicensed assistive personnel shall follow facility/agency policy and procedure forthe task/function involved. The decision to delegate is also based on the facili- ties/agencies regulatory entity and their rules andregulations. Just because you can delegate does not mean you mmi should delegate. For further information on delegation refer to the National Council State Board of Nursing Dele-gation Paper; Working with Others: A Position Paper. This paper may be found at the following link:w ww.ncsbn.or g/1625.h tmThe Iowa Board of Nursing office frequently receives tele- phone calls from licensees and license applicants askingabout whether an arrest or a criminal conviction is requiredto be reported to the Board. Generally speaking all criminalconvictions received by an LPN, RN or ARNP or applicant forlicensure are required to be reported to the Board. CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AND APPLICANTS FOR LICENSURE In order for an individual to become licensed in Iowa, they must first graduate from a state board approved nursing pro-gram, at which time they can then apply for licensure. The license application asks the following question: \"Have you ever pled guilty to, or been convicted of, a criminaloffense, other than a minor traffic violation? (Include de-ferred judgments). Often applicants will ask what is a \"conviction\" or a \"deferred judgment\" or if an arrest only must be reported. Aconviction includes a finding by a judge, jury or other courttribunal of guilt; a conviction includes a guilty plea that hasbeen accepted by the court. Convictions may result in adeferred judgment or a suspended sentence based uponeither a finding of guilt or a guilty plea. Deferred judgmentsare often described as an opportunity to forgo a penalty suchas jail time in exchange for meeting certain conditions for acertain period of time. Likewise, applicants often ask about\"expunged\" records, or say that they have been advised theydo not have to declare their convictions on job applicationsbecause they had a deferred sentence or an expungedrecord. For the purposes of the Iowa Board of Nursing, anycriminal conviction that an applicant has had, unless it is fora traffic offense such as speeding, must be reported, regard-less of whether it was a deferred judgment or you have beentold that the record was \"expunged. \" Frequently applicants will ask if an \"OWI\" or the offense of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated is a criminaloffense or a traffic offense, it is a criminal offense and it mustbe reported. Sometimes individuals are arrested and charged with a crime, but those charges are later dismissed or droppedentirely. Arrests that do not result in any conviction, entry ofa guilty plea or a deferred judgment do not have to bereported to the Board of Nursing. Arrests without a docu-mented disposition may appear on a criminal backgroundcheck and may trigger further questions of an applicant bythe Board. If an applicant answers \"yes\" to the criminal conviction question on the licensure application they must providecopy(s) of the sentencing order(s) when submitting applica-tion materials. The Board of Nursing will review each individ-ual application and criminal record and make a final decisionregarding licensure. The applicant has the option to sit forthe NCLEX exam before or after they have received approvalfor licensure. The applicant will be asked to submit the fol-lowing written materials to the board office at the time ofapplication.Sandra Colin, Health Professions Investigator, has retired after 23 years of service with the Iowa Board of Nursing. What The Iowa Board of Nursing Wants to Know About Y our Criminal and Disciplinary History a. Send a copy of the Court records; i.e. trial informa- tion, judgment entry and sentencing order with the application . b. A written assessment of your life before, at the time of, and after the conviction. c.

Thecourse is designed specifically for the supervision role in thelong term care patient setting. A board approved nursingprogram or an approved provider of continuing educationmust provide the course. The area community colleges offer courses. It is the responsibility of the licensed practical nurse to maintain hisor her certificate documenting completion of the course. A licensed practical nurse is entitled to supervise without the educational requirement outlined above if the licensedpractical nurse was performing in a supervisory role on orbefore October 6, 1982. Verification is required. If licensees are unable to obtain the course within the first six months of employment, the LPN must write to the Boardexplaining the reason a waiver of the LPN Supervisory Courseis being requested. Licensed practical nurses who are enrolled full-time in a registered nurse program are not exempt from the course.However, an LPN who is a full-time student in an RN programand who is scheduled to graduate within one year, mayrequest a waiver by writing to the board office. The requestfor a waiver must state the number of credit hours to betaken each semester and include the student's expected dateof graduation. Individuals who do not graduate from the RN program as scheduled or who are not successful on the RN-NCLEX \u00aemust take the next available course.NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT The Iowa Board of Nursing is pleased to be a member of the nurse licensure compact. This new form of licensure andregulation will better protect the public by: Allowing competent nurses to provide care both physical- ly and electronically wherever care is needed; Providing the public ready access to and a choice of qual- ified nurses; Protecting clients against incompetent nurses or unsafe nursing care through better communication between boardsof nursing, cooperative disciplinary investigations andprompt reporting of disciplinary action; Benefiting employers of nurses by having a more mobile workforce and a convenient centralized database for verifica-tion of licensure credentials. Understanding the Basics The nurse licensure compact allows a nurse who resides in a compact state to hold ONE license in the nurse's primarystate of residence and practice in all other states in which thecompact is in effect. Primary state of residence is where thenurse holds a driver's license, pays taxes and/or votes. The compact requires the nurse to practice according to the laws and regulations of the state in which the nurseprovides care where the patient is located at the time thecare is provided. The practice laws and regulations for manystates are available online. A nurse who is under discipline may be in a monitoring agreement, which restricts practice across state lines. If you hold a license in a COMPACT state and RESIDE in that COMPACT state, your license is a multistate license whichauthorizes you to practice in any other compact state.If you hold a license in a COMPACT state, but do not RESIDE in that compact state (reside in a non-compact state),your license is a single state license and it authorizes you topractice only in that compact state. For example, if you holdan Iowa nursing license, but do not live in Iowa, the license isa single state license and does not grant you the privilege topractice in any other state. If you are licensed in both Iowa and another compact state and RESIDE in the other compact state, your Iowa nurs-ing license will be administratively placed on inactive statusimmediately. Only one active license can be held by a licens-ee among the compact states. The compact does not supersede federal law. There- fore if you are employed in military service or work for thefederal government, you may continue to hold a nursinglicense in any state you choose. If you are working as a nursein a nongovernmental capacity, you are required to contactthe state board of nursing in that state to determine if a nurs-ing license is required. If you move from one compact state to another com- pact state and practice nursing, you must obtain a license inyour new home state. However, you may continue to prac- tice under the former home state license and the multistatelicensure privilege in the new home state for a period not t o exceed 30 da ys. a. The 30-days shall begin with the date of hire/employment in the new primary state of resi-dence. b. If the licensee begins employment before changing primary state of residence, the 30-days begins uponthe date that the licensee establishes the new pri-mary state of residence.

If the criminal conviction hasbeen reviewed by the Board, a licensee shall answer affirma-tively to these questions on future license applicationsand/or renewals and indicate the issue has been reviewed bythe Board.

ABANDONMENT The Iowa Board of Nursing (Board) receives numerous telephone calls from individual nurses as well as employersrequesting clarification of the abandonment issue. Thoughthe Board rules do not define the term \"abandonment, \" the Board has investigated and disciplined nurses in the past forissues surrounding the concept of abandonment as it relates to the nurse's duty to the patient. The Iowa Board of Nursing rule that relates to this issue, Iowa Administrative Code4.6(4)\"h, \"states that it is unethical conduct if you fail to reportto, or leave, a nursing assignment without properly notifyingappropriate supervisory personnel and ensure the safety andwelfare of the patient or client. Callers also inquire if it is considered abandonment to resign from a position and give less notice than required bythe facility. While this is a standard that most professionalsadhere to, the Board is concerned with patient safety and willnot consider it to be abandonment as long as the licenseenotifies appropriate supervisory personnel and ensures thesafety and welfare of the patient or client.

And, flavored milk accounts for less than 3.5% of added sugar intake in children ages 6-12 and less than 2% in teens. 5Reasons Why Flavored Milk Matters 1 KIDS LOVE THE TASTE! Milk provides nutrients essential for good health and kids will drink more when it's flavored. 2 NINE ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS! Flavored milk contains the same nine essential nutrients as white milk - calcium, potassium, phosphorous, protein, vitamins A, D and B12, riboflavin and niacin (niacin equivalents) - and is a healthful alternative to soft drinks. 3 HELPS KIDS ACHIEVE 3 SERVINGS! Drinking low-fat or fat-free white or flavored milk helps kids get the 3 daily servings* of milk recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 4 BETTER DIET QUALITY! Children who drink flavored milk meet more of their nutrient needs; do not consume more added sugar, fat or calories; and are not heavier than non- milk drinkers. 5 TOP CHOICE IN SCHOOLS! Low-fat chocolate milk is the most popular milk choice in schools and kids drink less milk (and get fewer nutrients) if it's taken away. These health and nutrition organizations support 3-Every-DayTM of Dairy, a science-based nutrition education program encouraging Americans to consume the recommended three daily servings of nutrient-rich low-fat or fat-free milk and milk products to improve overall health. www.nationaldairycouncil.org/childnutrition\u00a9National Dairy Council 2010\u00ae REFERENCES: * DAILY RECOMMENDATIONS - 3 cups of low-fat or fat-free milk or equivalent milk products for those 9 years of age and older and 2 cups of low-fat and fat-free milk or equivalent milk products for children 2-8 years old.1.
