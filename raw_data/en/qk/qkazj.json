Chronic fatigue - heavy chest - chest pain - recurring infections - disrupted hormonal cycle - memory loss - anxiety and bad skin? Many of my patients have, (and many new patients as well) which is why I wanted to get this special detoxification information out to you. With the recent push and shove for vaccinating globally by big Pharma, people have been experiencing varying side effects - from mild reactions right through to severe and even fatal. Just ask the nurses in the hospitals! The good news is... The following Vaccine Detoxification is specific to the Covid ingredients and removing or (chelating) them from your body. This will ensure fewer long-term medical complications, so you can get back to feeling like yourself again. Dive in for a comprehensive breakdown of recommendations for combatting those potentially serious post-vaccine symptoms. BUT before we start... you need to know!... What is REALLY in These Vaccines? It's time we uncovered some real hard truths about the ingredients found in vaccines that the government have \"claimed\" to be safe to inject into our bodies. Below is a list of some of the documented heavy metals and toxins used in vaccines to date: Aluminium: Can cause bone marrow and brain degeneration (memory loss/Alzheimer's/Parkinson's/premature dementia) Ammonium Sulphate: Suspected gastrointestinal, liver, nerve and respiratory system poison Animal, Bacterial & Viral DNA: Can be incorporated into the recipient's DNA and cause unknown genetic mutations Beta-Propiolactone: Known to cause cancer, suspected gastrointestinal, liver, and skin poison Formaldehyde: Major ingredient of embalming fluid used to preserve dead bodies. Linked to various cancers. Gelatine: Produced from selected pieces of calf and cattle skin, cattle bones, and pork skin. Known to cause anaphylactic reactions Gentamicin Sulphate and Polymyxin B (Antibiotic): Can cause allergic reactions and gut dysbiosis Glutaraldehyde: Causes throat and lung irritations, asthma, difficulty breathing, dermatitis, allergies and birth defects Human & Animal Cells: Human cells from aborted foetuses and human albumin; pig blood, horse blood, rabbit brain, guinea pig, dog kidney, cow heart, monkey kidney, chick embryo, chicken egg, duck egg, calf serum, sheep's blood, etc Latex Rubber: Can cause life-threatening allergic reactions Mercury (Thimerosal): A welldocumented neurotoxin and poison. Is still found in the multidose flu vaccines throughout the world (but has been removed or reduced in concentration in many vaccines or renamed to disguise it) Micro-Organisms: Live and dead viruses and bacteria Monosodium Glutamate: A neurotoxin. Linked to various cancers. Known to cause metabolic disturbances (e.g. diabetes), seizures and other neurologic and respiratory disorders such as asthma and anaphylaxis Neomycin Sulphate (Antibiotic): Interferes with B6 absorption which can lead to epilepsy and mental retardation. Allergic reactions can range from mild to life-threatening Phenol/Phenoxyethanol (2-PE): Used in antifreeze. Toxic to cells and capable of disabling the immune system's primary response mechanism. Polysorbate 80: Known to cause cancer and infertility in animals. Tri(N) Butyl phosphate: Suspected kidney and nerve poison. Below are the ingredients that are disclosed in the Covid 19 Vaccines. (NOTE: there are over 20 ingredients NOT disclosed) Pfizer: According to Pfizer's website and following the link to further product information, it is revealed that the drug phosphate dihydrate, sucrose and water for injections.\" According to the package insert, it contains: chimpanzee adenovirus vector encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Produced in genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. This product contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The ethanol, sucrose, sodium. What About the Side Effects to the Covid Vaccines? Early in 2021, Dr Sherri Tenpenny listed the following possible mechanisms of injuries from COVID-19 Injections: Headaches, fatigue, myalgia, fever, chills, injection-site pain, and anaphylaxis (which can lead to death) are major concerns. Many of the anaphylaxis reactions have been attributed to an additive called polyethylene glycol. Facial asymmetry (Bell's Palsy) is another concern. The direct adverse effect of the anti-spike immunoglobulins... the antibody that's supposed to protect you, is instead going to attack you, particularly your lungs. As that antibody floats around in your system, and you get re-exposed to coronaviruses that are out in circulation, that's when the accelerated autoimmune reactions happen. And if you've had a flu shot prior to getting a coronavirus vaccine, you have an accelerated risk of developing a much more severe side effect and reaction, because of the influenza viruses themselves and because of the antibodies that are developed when you receive a flu shot. In an interview with Dr Ryan Cole, a Board-Certified Pathologist, he states: \"...if you take the spike with the rest of the body of the virus gone, just the spike alone, and inject it into animal models, we know that that spike alone can induce vascular disease, pulmonary disease, brain disease, disease throughout the body. So, the spike ends up being the inflammatory aspect of the virus. And now we selected a vaccine, or a gene sequence, that literally codes for the spike. So, we know that once that spike is given in the arm, it doesn't stay there. Studies show that the spike does circulate, and the S1 fragment of this spike can cross the blood-brain barrier. The S1 fragment can cause the inflammatory patterns. It induces the inflammation. I think it was an article in Nature - they said we should really focus on the receptor binding domain, just that little part where the virus binds and not the whole spike.\" Here in Australia, the government has given the manufacturers of COVID-19 vaccines, full indemnity against liability for any side effects. That means if you (or your child) suffer any side effects or even die, you have no recourse and it's tough luck! Would you buy a car without a warranty? If the engine explodes or the airbags don't work, tough cookies, you die... or worse, you may end up paralysed with a brain injury. I know nearly all people wouldn't accept this with a car, so why do we accept this with our bodies? What is the Solution? What Can You Do? One simple method of fortifying your body against the vaccine side effects is to reduce inflammation, and this begins with your diet. In a nutshell, \"An anti-inflammatory diet consists of foods that reduce inflammatory responses. This diet involves replacing sugary, refined foods with whole, nutrient-rich foods\" according to Jenna Fletcher of Medical News Today. A key feature of an anti-inflammatory diet is the value placed on antioxidants. These reactive molecules in foods work to reduce the damaging effects of free radicals in the body that damage cells and contribute to disease. Foods to avoid include processed and cured meats, packaged snacks, sugary and carbonated drinks, excess carbohydrates, alcohol, gluten and trans fats like margarine. An Anti-Inflammatory Diet - 6 weeks - Eat plenty of glutathione-rich foods as they assist your body in eliminating toxins - these include asparagus, avocado, broccoli, cabbage, kale, garlic, spinach, okra, onions and carrots.

Probiotics have been shown in research to decrease vaccine side effects. - Avoid adding new types of foods, personal care products, household products, bedding and clothing - this is in order to prevent an allergic reaction which can distract the immune system. - Stop smoking or vaping any substance and stop all alcohol and caffeine whilst detoxing vaccines. - Stop watching the News on TV or reading about it in newspapers. It only makes you emotionally and mentally weak and depressed, lowering your immune system after consuming the onslaught of negativity, fear and propaganda. - Watch instead a comedy or enjoy a good book and intentionally find ways to lift your spirits and thus your immunity. - Listen to music you find uplifting - Exercise to burn off nervous energy. Consider spiritual pursuits as well. While not everyone's spirituality is the same, your spiritual side may also be incredibly healing to you at this time. Now is the time to lean into the wisdom and practices that bring you peace. Carve a space for this into each day, and preferably begin and end each day by nourishing your spirit. Use your spirituality to bring comfort and maintain perspective. Simple deep breathing is also an effective stress reducer. When we become fearful or experience anxiety, our breath quickens and also becomes shallower. Your heart rate and blood pressure spike as the vagus nerve gets the adrenal signal that something is wrong. Try 5 minutes each morning of intentional deep breathing.

Dr Thomas Cowan: \"Health does not come from the injection of toxins into our bodies.\" It is in our hands to make a choice to protect ourselves and our families from the toxic ingredients in the covid vaccines. After reading this article, hopefully you feel more empowered with knowledge and resources to better understand the problems and side effects related to this public health issue. Having a holistic approach by understanding how these ingredients are linked to ailments and taking additional steps for prevention and resolvement and cure, helps us on the road to recovery. Above all, never be afraid to challenge authority when it comes to your health and well-being. Are you willing to take the risk? The choice is all yours!... however, if you were \"forced to vaccinate\", then you now have a 'get out of jail free' card above... through our specific detoxification programme. Quotes from Physicians on Vaccines in General: Dr Suzanne Humphries: \"My current opinion about vaccinations is that they have never been safe, never has there been a safe vaccine, never will there be a safe vaccine and it is not possible to have a safe vaccine. The reasoning for that is that the actual process of vaccination defies the natural function of the immune system of living beings. It thwarts the immune system into a balance that's very unnatural and that leaves it susceptible to more things than just what you may be vaccinated supposedly for\". Dr Kelly Brogan: \"As those of us who shake our heads in pain and frustration watching the sheep get herded off the cliff, we refrain: these agents cannot be considered \"safe and effective\" and also \"unavoidably unsafe\" as the government agencies would have us accept. They are avoidably unsafe, in fact, when you don't use them as part of your healthcare.\" Dr Larry Palevsky: \"One of the assumptions we have heard is that high vaccinations protect those vulnerable and it reduces the probability of those people vaccinated to spread the germ to others. Never once in my 37 years have, I ever seen a study that showed that a vaccination makes the bacteria or the virus disappear from the body of those who are vaccinated. Yet all we continue to say is that once a vaccine is given not only are people are immune but the bacteria and viruses are no longer in their bodies to transmit to others, and that is not true. We have also heard that once you are vaccinated you are immune. Well actually the text books don't say that....We are told that unvaccinated children are the only children (and the only people) that are capable of spreading germs but that's not true either because vaccinated children can still spread germs, they can still carry the bacteria and viruses that we vaccinate against, and so can adults...\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsJ4i9Z3Qfs Dr Larry Palevsky (again): \"You can't vaccinate believing that your children are protected and then feel that your children are not protected because somehow some non-vaccinated child is carrying some secret organism that no-one else is carrying. It just doesn't make any sense.\" Dr Raymond Obomsawin: \"Personally, I can attest to the fact that as a child I did get all the vaccines available. I also came down with measles and mumps and chickenpox...natural immunity is the only true immunity. Everything else is an artificial attempt to cheat nature\". Dr Robert Sears: \"The stupidity of having the Hep B vaccine on the schedule for every American born newborn is what woke me up to even scrutinise the (vaccine) schedule\" and \"I've had the privilege to basically watch around 15,000 unvaccinated kids grow up as healthy children.\" Dr Shiv Chopra (who started his career developing vaccines for pharmaceutical companies): \"Vaccine induced adverse reactions, including autism, diabetes, cancer, allergies & various neurological disorders continue to mount & more so where vaccines are used the most. For all these reasons I refer to vaccines as \"cluster bombs\" which, when injected, explode in all parts of one's body & knock out some of the most critical organs & tissues. Therefore, my opinion on this subject is that no currently used vaccine does any good to anyone's health & every vaccine is potentially dangerous to everyone's health.\" Dr Jo Mercola: \"There was a deliberate confusion by the public health authorities to make the public believe the vaccines were far more effective than they were, so they would use data to show that the incidence of the disease they were vaccinating against had dropped dramatically since the introduction of vaccines but what they failed to do was extend the graphs further (before the vaccines) where it had already gone down by at least 90%.\" Dr Bernard Dalbergue (a former pharmaceutical industry physician with Gardasil manufacturer Merck): \"I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all times because at some point in time, the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat that it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer and that all the very many adverse effects which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose than to generate profit for the manufacturers.\" Dr Paul Thomas (who wrote 'The Vaccine-Friendly Plan'): \"I have over 13,000 children in my paediatric practice and I have to say, as unpopular as this observation might be, my unvaccinated children are by far the healthiest.\" Dr Liz Mumper: \"As somebody who has studied vaccines for many years, and I've read every single (vaccine) insert of every single vaccine, I'm not as worried about the short-term effects - the redness, the swelling, all those signs that show that the body has recognised the shot is foreign and is reacting to it. I'm much more concerned about potential long term affects - brain inflammation or auto- "}
