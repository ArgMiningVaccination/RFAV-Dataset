Ileen was a member of Rudolf Steiner's Experimental Circle of Anthroposophic Farmers and Gardeners (from 1936). Ernesto was the first Australian member (from 1928). At their Demeter Farm in Dandenong, Victoria, they practiced biodynamic agriculture on over 40 acres (16 ha) through the years of the Great Depression, through World War II, and for the first decade of the post-war years, producing milk, fruit, and vegetables. Ileen was an early Australian Anthroposophist and follower of Rudolf Steiner. It was a blow to their Demeter Farm enterprise when she fell ill. Eventually she was no longer able to manage physical work at all and this fell to Ernesto. Although she is remembered as 'the woman in the wheelchair' this paper reveals that she was previously an active, fit and keen sportswoman, participating in basketball, tennis, running, hockey, and dancing. At school she was known as 'Ikey', she was a prefect, she was a member of the school sports committee, and she won the prize for \"best all-round sport\". Ileen was confined to a wheelchair for the last four decades of her life. The cause has generally been misunderstood and misattributed, and is revealed here to be pernicious anaemia (lack of vitamin B12). This condition is now easily and successfully treatable, but it was then generally fatal. Ileen was a financial supporter of the Anthroposophical movement in Australia during her lifetime. Her benefaction has continued since her death via the Ileen Macpherson Trust which reports having dispensed over $600,000 for Anthroposophic causes in Australia. A portrait of Ileen by Italian/Australian artist Ernesto Genoni and photographs of Ileen are presented.

Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania Two members of Rudolf Steiner's Experimental Circle were the first to establish a Demeter Farm in Australia. In 1934 Ileen Macpherson (1898-1984) and Ernesto Genoni (1885-1964) founded their 'Demeter Biological Farm' on the Princes Highway in Dandenong, Victoria. They were guided by Steiner's book of his Agriculture Course (1924). They managed their 40 acre farm using biodynamic (BD) practices for the next two decades. Ileen and Ernesto pioneered biodynamic and thereby organic farming in Australia. They were the first to adopt the name 'Demeter' for an Australian BD enterprise. This was before the terms 'biodynamic farming' and 'organic farming' had any currency (which date from 1938 and 1940 respectively). They worked their BD farm for two decades until the farm was sold in 1954. Journal of Organics Journal of Organics Ernesto Genoni (1885-1975) was a pioneer of biodynamic and organic farming in Australia. He was the first Australian member of Rudolf Steiner's Experimental Circle of Anthroposophic Farmers & Gardeners (joining in 1928). Others in Ernesto's set joined the Experimental Circle, including his eldest brother, Emilio (in 1930), Ruby Macpherson (in 1935), and her niece, Ileen Macpherson (in 1936). Ernesto and Ileen founded and farmed Australia's original 'Demeter Farm' (from 1935). However biodynamic and organic farming was but one aspect of Ernesto's life. Ernesto trained for five years in classical art at the prestigious Brera Academy of Fine Art in Milan (Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera). Ernesto spent the year 1924 at Dornach, Switzerland, the headquarters of Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy movement, where he experimented with painting \"in the anthroposophic way\". The works presented here and in the exhibition, Angels of the First Class, are believed to be those works. Eleven images (image 1 and images 5 through 14) were recently revealed stored in a folder in a private collection along with Ernesto's personal poster of the first Goetheanum (image 4). Images 15 and 16 are from two other private collections and are included here (and in the exhibition) because, by size, content, and style, they appear to be part of Ernesto's suite of Anthroposophic paintings of 1924. A century ago, Ernesto joined the AIF in Western Australia and served as a stretcher bearer on the killing fields of the Western Front in 1916, in the battles of the Somme and Pozi\u00e8res. From the battlefield, he was conscripted into the Italian Army, and he was eventually demobilised in Italy in 1919. In 1923 , Ernesto was still in Italy. From Milan, he wrote to Rudolf Steiner offering his labour for advancing the Anthroposophy project at Dornach. Ernesto arrived there early in 1924 and successfully applied to Dr Steiner for acceptance into the First Class (Erste Klasse der Freien Hochschule f\u00fcr Geisteswissenschaft). The First Class was Steiner's new course of instruction in Spiritual Science for Anthroposophists who were established in their practice. Steiner held these classes from 15 February through to 20 September of 1924. In 1926, Ernesto migrated to Australia (after two previous visits) with the intention of exhibiting his art - most probably his classical style oil paintings - but he was thwarted in this plan by the prevailing Depression. In Australia, Ernesto co-founded the Michael Group in Melbourne (Anthroposophy meetings beginning in 1928) for the study of Steiner's works. He taught the First Class in Melbourne and Adelaide. The works presented here were first exhibited as Angels of the First Class: The Anthroposophic Art of Ernesto Genoni, Goetheanum, 1924, held at the Vital Years Conference 2016, Hobart, Tasmania in July 2016. It is believed to be the first exhibition of art works by Ernesto Genoni. Journal of Organics International, Open Access, Peer Reviewed, Free Special Issue *The Anthroposophic Art of Ernesto Genoni by John Paull Journal Bio-Dynamics Tasmania Dalmore Farm (1933-1934) was Victoria's first biodynamic farming venture. A letter, written in Milan, Italy, in Italian in 1934 by Rosa Genoni (1867-1954) \\ enables details of this venture to be finally revealed. Rosa wrote of her youngest brother, Ernesto Genoni (1885-1975): \"Now Ernesto ... is at Dalmore, a farm of my brother Marino (the father of the boy [Alfredo Genoni (1913-1999)] who was sent to us years ago from Australia and we sent him to Dornach where he stayed for two years, and two more to the school at Stuttgart) and in part by my brother Angelo, who asked Ernesto to go and organise the farm biologically\". \"Ernesto had a small wooden house built there for his use. It has only two rooms but it must be fairly comfortable, as Ernesto invited [Alfred] Meebold [1863-1952] to lodge with him for his future visit for the Melbourne group\". Ernesto Genoni had spent 1924 at the Goetheanum under the tutelage of Rudolf Steiner in both art and spiritual science. Ernesto recalled: I started in a small way to work a farm on Dr Steiner's bio-dynamic methods in association with Fred Genoni\". Ernesto was the first Australian to join Rudolf Steiner's Experimental Circle of Anthroposophic Farmers and Gardeners (in 1928). Ernesto subsequently embarked on an extensive study tour of Experimental Circle farms in Europe, visiting the leading practitioners of biodynamics: \"In 1930 I went to Dornach again to become acquainted with the BD farming. ... Pfeiffer farm at Rosendahl [Netherlands]\". The fate of the 80 acre Dalmore Farm was settled by the floods of 1934 which extinguished the hopes for this first BD venture in Victoria. The December 1934 flood was the \"largest flood on record\". Ernesto subsequently established another biodynamic farm, Demeter Farm (1934-1954).

Organics in the Global Food Chain Journal of Fine Arts The lost and last portrait of Edith Maryon (1872-1924), presented in the present paper, was painted by the Italian/Australian artist Ernesto Genoni (1885-1975) at Dornach in 1924. Maryon was appointed by Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) at the Christmas Conference of the Anthroposophy Society, December 1923, as the leader of the Section for Sculptural Arts (akna Fine Art). She was an English sculptor who worked with Steiner to create the massive timber sculpture, 'The Representative of Humanity', now on display in the Goetheanum, the headquarters of the Anthroposophical Society, at Dornach, Switzerland. Ernesto Genoni trained at the renowned Brera Academy of Fine Art in Milan. He first met Maryon in 1920 on his first visit to Dornach. Genoni returned to Dornach at about the time of the Christmas Conference, December 1923, he successfully applied to Steiner to be in the inaugural First Class of the School of Spiritual Science. Genoni remained in Dornach for most of the year 1924. Edith Maryon died on 2 May 1924 reportedly of tuberculosis (TB). Genoni left Dornach only after Steiner withdrew from public life and retreated to his sick bed (on 28 September 1924). Genoni took the art that he had created at Dornach back to Milan, Italy, and some of it went on to Australia when he emigrated in 1926. Genoni's portrait of Maryon has remained in the Genoni family in Milan since that time but with the subject long forgotten (or perhaps never known to the family). Genoni painted portraits of significant women in his life, including his sister Rosa and his niece Fanny (in Milan, Italy), and his partner Ileen Macpherson and his niece Anne Fiedler (in Melbourne, Australia). The portrait of this paper, is now identified as of Edith Maryon, thereby reuniting the artwork with its subject, and dating it in the last four months of Maryon's life (January to April 1924). History of Education 2018 Education in Victoria, Australia not only underwent significant change in the 1970s, but was witness to a widespread educational reform project. Whilst exploration of the more widespread alternatives has been of some interest, the smaller progressive traditions that emerged in some ways 'alongside' the broader reforms have rarely been examined in any detail. This article explores the founding of the Melbourne Rudolf Steiner School (MRSS) in the 1970s, the first of its kind in Victoria, and the third such school nationally. Analysis is based primarily on interviews with educators directly involved. L.A. Reid's notion of education as an 'aesthetic' object is drawn on to examine the collective experiences of the founders of the MRSS, and the particular expression they gave to Steiner's educational ideas.
