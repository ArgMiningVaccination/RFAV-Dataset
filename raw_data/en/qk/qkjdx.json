REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACTIVITIES Department of Health Activities Mr. Kraut introduced Dr. Zucker to give a report on the Department of Health report. COVID-19 Dr. Zucker began his report by stating the Departm ent has been working closely with Governor Cuomo on the public health provisions of t he 2020 - 2021 budget. While at the same time monitoring both the robust flu season and the novel Coronavirus that the WHO last week declared a global emergency. Dr. Zucker advised tha t he joined the Governor to discuss the ongoing preparations across New York State includin g our many conversations with Healthcare providers and local Health Department as new develo pments are occurring each day. The 3 Department is in daily communication with colleague s at CDC and the rest of HHS and with New York City as we closely monitor developments in China and here in the US. Currently, we have no confirmed cases of Novel Coronavirus in the entire State. There are only 12 cases in the United States as of today. Here in New York we've h ad 21 patients under investigation, 13 have had negative results, and eight have pendin g results as of today. The Department's focus continues aggressively identifying any new potentia l for exposure when travelers returning to New York. The Department is also adding this novel Coronavirus to the Department's list of communicable diseases which requires Healthcare Pro viders to report persons under investigation to their local health department and ultimately to the State Health Department. Reporting investigation of cases is already taking place and adopting novel Coronavirus up to this list will improve our ability to coordinate ef forts with local Health officials to control the spread of the disease if necessary. Additionally th e Wadsworth Center has been authorized to use CDC's diagnostic test for the novel Coronavirus. Th e Department is working quickly to implement that testing. The Department very well pr epared for this response and New York State and local public health officials and health care f acilities are very experienced with infectious control practices. The CDC has complimented this s tate on its preparation and how we are leading the nation on what we are doing on this. Flu Dr. Zucker gave an update on the flu. The flu is st ill prevalent and is already claiming the lives of three children in the New York. The first week of February, more than 2,000 New Yorkers were hospitalized with influenza and Ne w York state has seen more reported cases at this point then in 2019 - 2020 flu season then p revious years. This flu season is shaping up to be a pretty active one. There have been over 73,000 confirmed cases. While concerns for the Coronavirus is valid, we do not want to underscore the preventative measures an influence that all New Yorkers must take and last month the Govern or directed the department to use the health electronic response data or the HERDS to ensure tha t hospitals have the capacity, the guidance, the resources necessary to combat the recent surge in hospitalizations. The Department continues to remind New Yorkers that it's not too late to get the flu shot. Anyone older than six months old should be vaccinated. The elderly and children youn ger than two years of age are particularly vulnerable and do need protection. 2020-2021 Budget Dr. Zucker advised that the 2020-2021 Budget faces significant budgetary challenges this year to resolve the structural deficit. Governor Cu omo proposed in January to revisit and effective strategy that was implemented after he fi rst took office. In 2011 the Governor convened the Medicaid Redesign Team (MRT) to tackle the grow th and spending of the Medicaid Program. The initial Medicaid reforms held spending growth down under the global cap, New York now re-calibrate to ensure that they are worki ng as intended and to meet the change in landscape. The Governor has reconvened the Medicaid Redesign Team or MRT II to advance a comprehensive recommendation to reform the state's Medicaid Program to preserve benefits and to identify $2.5 billion and structural savings. Th e Governor announced the full membership of 4 MRT and the team will be co-chaired by Michael Dowl ing, the president and CEO of Northwell Health on Long Island and Dennis Rivera, the former president of the SEIU. Both were co-chairs of the successful MRT in 2011. New York State Medic aid directed Ms. Frescatore will serve as the team's executive director and in total the team will have 21 voting members including myself. The team will hold its first meeting on Tue sday and will submit its Report with findings and recommendations to the Governor and legislature in March for consideration in the fiscal year 2021 and acted budget. Dr. Zucker stated the proposed budged contains a nu mber of provisions that the Governor and the Department have jointly promoted for a heal thy New York. These include defending Reproductive Rights and protecting against maternal mortality. Enacting comprehensive nicotine vaping and tobacco control in youth and improving a ccess to prescription drugs and sharing access to clean drinking water among the number of other important initiatives. Regarding New York State of Health, 95 percent of the state's res idents have health insurance, over 18 million New Yorkers. New York State of Health continues to grow with more than 4.8 million enrolled across all programs and open enrollment for one of the New York State of Health qualified health plans to HP for 2020 has been extended until February 7th to give consumers more time to enroll.

Dr. Boufford began her report by stating the Preven tion Agenda 2019 to 2024 is underway. The Council approved it in December of 20 18 and the process is underway. Dr. Boufford also noted that thanks to the Governo r's December 2018 Executive Order regarding the age friendliness of their policies, p rograms, and their purchasing and contracting, the process has been moving thanks to agency groups, Co mmissioner Zucker and Paul Francis. The group met in January right after the executive order was passed and have been looking to integrate the healt h across all policies with the agencies with the form al domains of age friendliness as defined by the World Health Organization and supported by the AARP. It is quite integrated into the Prevention Agenda. The group is focusing all of our goals on people of all ages in the State and there has also been the support of the John Hartford Foundation lo oking and supporting working with the Commissioner on age friendly public health initiati ves as well as a matronly hospitals in other areas of work. Dr. Boufford stated there was a Population Health S ummit in February of 2019. Attended by 700 people from all around the State. They look ed at issues of the Prevention Agenda and public health and also featuring presentations by o ther agencies who are very important to health. Some of the agencies that have been most active bot h joining the Ad Hoc Leadership Group and in the work are the Office of Mental Health, OASAS , Office for the Aging and added Agriculture and Markets. Parks, Recreation, Histori c preservation, the energy department agency has been fantastic. Really looking at energy saving s, indoor housing. The Department of State with it's very important Economic Development oppor tunities through the regional economic development councils and the development zones for cities. Paul Beyer and his boss have been fabulous in giving incentives to communities to app ly for these grant programs giving waiting heavily if they really can do a health-promoting or age-friendly project. Dr. Boufford advised the Public Health Committee c ontinues to work with the Health Planning Committee especially looking at the implementation of the CON conditions, wanting to look at what the particular applicant is doing In the prevention agenda area starting with acute facilities. The Committee's hope over the next months to expand int o various ambulatory care and the long-term care report would also include looking at what that looks like for age friendliness as well from those institutions. The maternal mortality report that th is Council approved a couple of years ago has reall y morphed into a maternal mortality commission of the Governor and is pursuing its agenda and our public health committee. Dr. Boufford advised that one of the Committee's first meetings this year and will be just seeing how that's going, how the implementation is going with the commission and also a particular interest of the public health committee and the cou ncil had been pre-hospital, sort of the organizatio n of pre-hospital maternity services and early identi fication of high-risk women. The focus of hospital 7 emergency management is very advanced and a lot of interesting proposals that are being looked at by the commission for not being looked at, being imple mented on workforce development but we are still very interested in the pre-hospital side of it. Sin ce maternal mortality has really picked up by the Governor's commission, the Committee has decided to take on one other item aside from its involvement in the Ad Hoc Leadership Group and over sight of the prevention agenda and now the health across all and age friendly are taking on vi olence in the context of violence prevention and th e context of the prevention agenda. Dr. Boufford stated the Committee has begun work o n this in June, had an earlier meeting, using the great expertise, we have had great briefi ngs from the Department, and the various areas on just about everything we've been looking at especia lly at gun violence but also at suicide, homicide rates, opioid addiction, and others just still look ing at the general area and feel beginning to hone in on what we are going to focus on. The Committee has also been bringing in other agencies. Obviously the core agencies OMH, OASAS, DOS, State Office of the Aging, but also office of Children and Family Services, domestic violence victim services, and we had a meeting in December where are we and also invited panel for the New York State Polic e Department of the Department of Labor and the Department of Criminal Justice Services. We have an other meeting scheduled. These are all our fact- finding efforts. In the spirit of wanting to make a difference with the things we could have leverage over and not duplicating efforts by other agencies, the group is we're being very deliberate about thi s process. We had hoped to have a meeting yesterday b ut for various reasons including attendance for reasons and also our ability to attend actually and the ability of our latest round of invitees, our s ort of last group of panelists were not able to be there. We are looking for another meeting later this month . and after that we'll be developing recommendations about how we want to how we want to pursue the violence prevention issues in the context of the pr evention agenda we will be bringing that to you for discussion probably at the March or April meeting. Then once we get the approval, we will move ahead and go back and start implementing as we did with the maternal mortality work. So again just to thank everyone, and I think our goal of making N ew York to healthiest State Mr. Kraut then moved to the next item on the agend a and introduced Mr. Robinson to give the Report of the Committee on Establishment and Projec t Review.

The first time you speak id entify yourself as a council member, a DOH staff. This wil l be helpful to the company recording the meeting. And of course the microphones are hot when they are flashing green he re or glowing green. They'll pick up every sound including the ru stling of papers next to the microphone, side conversations. So just be 2 mindful that one, the mic in front of you is turned to red until such time as you wish to speak. And I'm reminding o ur audience, there's a form that needs to be filled out before y ou enter this room. Which records your attendance. It's required by the joint commission on public ethics in accordance with exec utive law section 166. We also post this form on the Departme nt's website at NYHEALTH.GOV under the Certificate of Need tab, so in the future you could fill it out prior to your attendan ce at the council meetings and we appreciate your cooperation . Today's meeting is going to have two parts to it. The first is going to be our annual meeting of the Public Hea lth Council. We are going to take reports from Dr. Zucker and Mr . Hutton. Dr. Gutierrez will present regulations during our regul ar meeting. Dr. Boufford will provide an update on public healt h committee. And under the category of project review and recomm endations and establishment actions, Mr. Robinson will be reporti ng on a number of CON applications taken at the previous co mmittee meeting. Members of the council, most of our guests know by now or are familiar with our organization of our agenda by topics or categories that captures our roles and responsibili ties. This includes the organization and the batching of certi ficate of need applications we'll be voting on in today's mee ting. I'm going to ask the members to just take a look at how we've 3 structured the agenda and batch those applications. If you want a project to be moved to a different category or yo u believe you have to declare an interest or recusal, please let Colleen know and we will make modifications as necessary. I'm not going to call the annual meeting portion o f the meeting to order. The first act of business is I'd like to propose and move the election of the council's vice -chair and make a motion for Dr. Jo Ivey-Boufford to serve as vice-chair and continue in that role. And I'm assuming you agr ee. [so moved] We checked with her. So moved. Second, all those i n favor? [Aye] Opposed? All right. Motion carries. We're not going to have any changes to the standin g committee. Mr. Robinson is going to chair, Dr. Kalk ut being the vice-chair of Establishment and Project Review. Dr. Boufford will chair, Dr. Torres will vice-chair the public h ealth committee. Dr. Rugge will chair the health planning committee. The committee on codes, regulations, and legislatio n will be chaired by Dr. Gutierrez and vice-chair will serve as Mr. Holt. 4 Dr. Martin will continue to chair the health person nel and interprofessional relations committee, and Dr. Bouf ford will continue to chair the ad-hoc committee to lead on t he state health improvement plan. I'd like to thank all the members of the council for their hard work and dedication. We look forward to another productive year. I think at the next mee ting we're going to have the annual report of what we've accom plished, the compilation - it's in the booklet in the agenda tha t you received. Take a look at it. It gives you an idea o f the magnitude of what we had, the applications we've do ne, the dollar value, and more importantly than the CONs, i t's the rules and regulations, it's the planning work, it's the w ay that we've affected health policy or attempted to affect healt h policy in the State, and I think it's a good reminder of some of the important things that we get to do sitting around t his table. My next agenda item is going to be the adoption of minutes. I have proposed a motion for the adoption of the De cember 12, 2019 PHHPC minutes. Do I have a motion? I have a mo tion. Any comments? Dr. Boufford. JO BOUFFORD: Thank you. I'd like to amend the minu tes to reflect the discussion, I think it's on page 33 and 34 of the transcript between Dr. Rugge, myself, and you Jeff around the 5 request for sort of integrated presentation on stra tegy for long-term care. The various mechanisms by which lon g-term care is being delivered in this state. It appeared that that process has begun sort of again by type by type, and from o ur retreat had requested that. So, the text is reflected on 33 , 34 of the report. JEFF KRAUT: So, we'll amend the minutes - JO BOUFFORD: So, its business coming back to the c ouncil. JEFF KRAUT: So, we'll amend the minutes to reflect there is a request of the council for the Department to p rovide a more comprehensive overview of our long-term care polici es, and the direction we're going. And frankly, we have - this has been a request that Dr. Boufford indicated has gone back q uite a bit. Could we, after the meeting could we have a date ce rtain that presentation will be made? So, we can stop asking f or it? Thank you. With that amendment to the insertion into our amen dment to the minutes, do I have a vote all those in favor? [Aye] I'm second, do we need a second? 6 [You did have a second.] I have a second, Dr. Torres. Thank you. Any other comments on it by the way? Thank you for reading them. All t hose in favor, aye. [Aye] Opposed? Abstention? The motion carries. It's now my pleasure to turn to Dr. Zucker who wil l update the Council about the Department's activities since our last meeting. HOWARD ZUCKER: Hello. Good morning welcome. Happy New Year a month late. We're only a month into 2020 now but this is truly shaping up to be a challenging year for public heal th officials worldwide at this time and that includes obviously New York State Department of Health. So since our last meeti ng in December our department has been working closely wi th Governor Cuomo on the public health provisions of the 2020 - 2021 budget. At the same time, we've been monitoring both the ro bust flu season and now this novel Coronavirus that the WHO last week declared a global emergency. So I thought I'd jump right into this Coronavirus update because I gather everyone i s very interested in that. On Sunday, I joined the Governo r to discuss our ongoing preparations across New York State incl uding our 7 many conversations with Healthcare providers and lo cal Health Department as new developments are occurring each d ay. The department is in daily communication with our colle agues at CDC and the rest of HHS and with New York City as we cl osely monitor developments in China and here in the us. As we hav e said over the past few weeks, the risk to the public in New Y ork state is currently very low and we have no confirmed cases o f Novel Coronavirus in the entire State. There are only 12 cases in the United States as of today. Here in New York we've h ad 21 patients under investigation, 13 have had negative results, and eight have pending results as of today. And that in cludes both New York City and the rest of the state. And we are currently - that are currently under review with CDC and we wil l of course keep everyone updated as the information changes, a nd it does change relatively quickly. Our Focus continues on a ggressively identifying any new potential for exposure when Tra velers returning to renew York. We're also adding this nov el Coronavirus to the Department's list of communicabl e diseases which requires Healthcare Providers to report perso ns under investigation to their local health department and ultimately to the State Health Department. Of reporting investiga tion of cases is already taking place and adopting novel Coronavi rus up to this list will improve our ability to coordinate ef forts with local Health officials to control the spread of the disease if 8 necessary. And additionally the Wadsworth Center, N ew York State's public health laboratory has been authorize d to use CDC's diagnostic test for the novel Coronavirus. So we're working quickly to implement that testing. So the b ottom line is we are very well prepared for this response and New York state and local public health officials and health care f acilities are very experienced with infectious control practices and I will mention the CDC has complimented this state on its preparation and how we are leading the nation on what we're doi ng on this. Regarding flu updates; after the world of flu, the novel Coronavirus is not an immediate threat to New Yorke rs, the flu is still prevalent and is already claiming the live s of three children in the state. Just last week alone more th an 2,000 New Yorkers were hospitalized with influenza and New Yo rk state has seen more reported cases at this point then in 2019 - 2020 flu season then previous years. So this flu season is s haping up to be a pretty active one. So far this season we've ha d over 73,000 confirmed cases and we're expecting this week's res ults a little bit later today. Usually they come out mid-day Thur sday or a little bit later. While concerns for the Coronaviru s is valid, we do not want to underscore the preventative measu res an influence that all New Yorkers must take and last m onth the Governor directed the department to use the health electronic 9 response data or the HERDA to ensure that hospitals have the capacity, the guidance, the resources necessary to combat the recent surge in hospitalizations. And we continue t o remind New Yorkers that it's not too late to get the flu shot. Anyone older than six months old should be vaccinated. The elder ly and children younger than two years of age are particul arly vulnerable and do need protection. Regarding the budget. So the 2020-2021 budget as I' m sure you're aware, New York State faces a significant bu dgetary challenge this year to resolve the structural defic it. Governor Cuomo proposed last month to revisit and effective strategy that was implemented after he first took office. So in 2 011 the Governor convened the Medicaid Redesign Team or cal led the MRT at that time to tackle the growth and spending of t he Medicaid Program. and while the initial Medicaid reforms hel d spending growth down under the global cap, we must now re-ca librate to ensure that they are working as intended and to mee t the change in landscape. So the Governor has reconvened the Me dicaid Redesign Team or MRT II to advance a comprehensive recommendation to reform the state's Medicaid Progr am to preserve benefits and to identify $2.5 billion and structural savings. The Governor announced the full membership of MRT to on Tuesday and the team will be co-chaired by Michael Dowling, the 10 president and CEO of Northwell Health on Long Islan d and Dennis Rivera, the former president of the SEIU. Both were co-chairs of the successful MRT won in 2011. New York State Medi caid directed Don Frescatore will serve as the team's executive d irector and in total the team will have 21 voting members inclu ding myself. The team will hold its first meeting on Tuesday and will submit its Report with findings and recommendations to the Governor and legislature in March for consideration in the fisca l year 2021 and acted budget. And while MRT to has claimed most of the media attention, I want to note that the 2020 - 2021 budg et includes a number of Provisions that the Governor and the Depa rtment of Health have jointly promoted for healthy New York. These include defending Reproductive Rights and protecting agains t maternal mortality, something which we've worked on a lot th ese past years. Enacting comprehensive nicotine vaping and T obacco Control in Youth and improving access to prescripti on drugs and sharing access to clean drinking water among the nu mber of other important initiatives. Regarding New York state of health, 95 percent of the state's residents have health insura nce. That's over 18 million New Yorkers. Very impressive. Criti cal to this impressive achievement is the New York state of hea lth. And moment through the New York state of health continu es to grow with more than 4.8 million enrolled across all prog rams and open enrollment for one of the New York State of Health qualified 11 health plans to HP for 2020 has been extended until tomorrow, February 7th to give consumers more time to enroll. if you have not enrolled we encourage everyone to do so. So as you can see the Department has been taking on many different aggressive actions during the course of t he past several months. Obviously public health issues pop up as we just shared about Coronavirus, but we always are ready t o move forward and charge forward on what we need to do, a nd I'm happy to answer any questions at this point. JEFF KRAUT: Thank you Dr. Zucker. Are there questi ons? Yes, Mr. Rautenburg. ELLEN RAUTENBURG: My usual question is what does t he budget do to the local health departments? HOWARD ZUCKER: So we're working on that issue and then I know these are some of the challenges that we've ha d before, but I've spoken to a lot of the local health commission ers particularly because of the Corona Virus and as a g ood example of when challenged how we can help support them and whether it's supporting them through staff or whatever resources , we will. 12 ELLEN RAUTENBURG: In other words, there's a cut. S tate match? HOWARD ZUCKER: Well, there are cuts across - BRAD HUTTON: Dr. Zucker, there is no proposed redu ction in the executive budget for state aid this year. HOWARD ZUCKER: Right. And what we will do is conti nue to move forward on whatever we have to do on that. PETER ROBINSON: We understand that in light of wha t is a difficult budget year that there is some news tha t revenues are coming in a little bit higher than projected. A nd the question is will those potential higher revenues ha ve an effect on the target that's being established for the MRT? HOWARD ZUCKER: I'm not clear - revenues? PETER ROBINSON: State revenues. State tax revenues . JEFF KRAUT: So if It's not a $2.5 billion problem which is really a $5 billion problem because of the match ing funds, if 13 it's a $1 billion problem, you don't have any - the re's no confirmation that assumption is correct yet, is tha t correct? HOWARD ZUCKER: Let me check with budget on that. ANGEL GUTIERREZ: From this seat for several years now I have witnessed that we tend to be gloomier as we mo ve along and how we're perceived what is happening. And I am per plexed by that. Because when I hear the commissioner talk, I saw at least three remarks made that are calls for celebration. And we are not celebrating enough and we're placed on the defe nsive every time something like this Corona Virus happens or wh en the measles epidemic happens. Look at that advances all the things that public health has achieved in the last two cen turies. And look at what is happening as a result of that. I wa s trained to look at every admission as a failure of preventive care and I was, that was pounded into me for years. Now I'm no t admitting patients as much as I used to, not that I do it any more, practicing physicians are not admitting as much as we used to and patients are not staying in the hospital as lon g as they used to. Recently I hear that for the first time in 50 years, patients are dying at home more than are dying in t he hospital. What is that doing to hospital bed utilization. I t hink we need to celebrate and somehow get the advance on that by getting out 14 of the defensive position we're taking, Commissione r, and I wonder what efforts the health department is prepar ed to undertake in that direction? HOWARD ZUCKER: Well, we do celebrate - I mean, the Department, I have to tell you, the Department has done amazing job, we have an amazing team within the entire depa rtment. The other day, yesterday, we were doing the IMS calls f or Corona Virus, and I don't know, this is probably the 15 th time we activated the emergency systems for different thing s, and I looked around the room and I counted; there were 52 or -- 52 people in the room and 60 including the people on t he phone and everyone is working incredibly hard to tackle somet hing which is quite challenging and new and evolving every day, a nd we've done this with measles. Yesterday we had a meeting regar ding he issues of vaping, and we do move things forward. I think that sometimes people don't recognize how much, how chal lenging it is to tackle something as public health issues. And we celebrate internally once a year, and I think - ANGEL GUTIERREZ: We should celebrate in public. 15 HOWARD ZUCKER: Well, we have to get the rest of th e community, I mean more the media community to recog nize what we do. JEFF KRAUT: I'll just echo what you said, because I was a participant in our organizations - the mobilizati on effort when we turned the switch on, and it's not only my organization, I think it's all the major health providers, coordi nation with Greater New York, the Hospital Association, the hom ecare industry, it's remarkable how they are able to mobi lize and get ready and the planning that's going in here for so many different scenarios is really amazing. And it's ver y reassuring, and it's reminiscent of what we did in planning for Sandy and that you know, when we have hospital closures we we re able to take care of anybody who showed up who needed care. You know, the system has some organic elasticity to it and we were able to move people around and, Dr. Gutierrez, I just finis hed a book that I would recommend. It's called The Healthcare Reboot. And it talked about injecting kind of optimism into the national healthcare debate of this negative narrative that w e have difficulty communicating all the positive advances. It happens to be written by the CEO of my health system. So I voluntarily read it. But I will make copies available to us bec ause - he won't sign them. You'll put it on Ebay and you won' t get any 16 money. But, I think the narrative, it's an interest ing issue here that we do forget that. There is a lot to cele brate, but let's be honest. There's also a lot to fix. So, the issue is do you keep working on it and you keep improving. ANGEL GUTIERREZ: Look at this room. Particularly a round the table and then also out there on that end. Ther e are people here that lived through the 80s and the 90s during the thick of the AIDS epidemic. How many of our own children or grandchildren understand what happened then and how that was ende d? And I don't think that we have celebrated that. People do not understand the progress we have made and how powerf ul public health is. And that, I think we need to do more of, somehow. JEFF KRAUT: Ms. Monroe, and then Dr. Brown. ANN MONROE: Thank you Dr. Zucker. With the distres sing supreme court decision about public charge, and tha t, do you know if that's going to effect people's willingness to be on Medicaid? As part of their kind of, concern that th at will hurt them as they try to either stay in the United State s or become a citizen? Have you had any thoughts on that or do y ou anticipate any loss of Medicaid membership because of that pub lic charge decision? 17 HOWARD ZUCKER: The Governor is committed to everyo ne to be sure they get healthcare and is very progressive on these issues. And everyone we sit down with, MRT II we're going to sit and look at everything, but the goal is to make sur e that people get the care they need. JEFF KRAUT: Ms. Monroe, back in the 90s we had to greencard individuals who were showing up for prima ry care that was under the first Bush administration, there was a requirement. We ignored it. Just because that's not what you - you have to take care of the people that show up. HOWARD ZUCKER: That's the objective here. ANN MONROE: I'm just concerned that in addition to people voluntarily leaving the system out of fear, of something, that the system will be burdened with additional un insured as people pass on public benefits. So, I just think we have to be aware of that and be thinking about that. HOWARD ZUCKER: As I was saying, we have 95 percent insured in the state or more, and the goal is to get everyo ne insured and to make sure that anyone who is in New York has health care. 18 LAWRENCE BROWN: Lawrence Brown, member of the council. In the interest of the comments raised by my colleague, Dr. Gutierrez, I thought I would share with you an experience that I had recently that underscores the positive d irections that we're going with respect to public health. I w as asked to participate as a speaker with a group of 14 to 15 y ear olds about issues around substance abuse. I was honored to do so. I was even more touched when they sent me back a comm unication showing me the poster that they had constructed as a result of that experience. I think that, I agree with Dr. Gut ierrez, we need to take time to share these type of experience s that we have to demonstrate that not only is there been suc cess, but there continues to be a first with the fact that we share about the things that we do that are speaking in favor of the Public's Health in the state of New York. Now I must admit i n the interest of transparency, like you Mr. Kraut, that I wish it was from a school in New York. It was a school in Conne cticut. but nonetheless, we New Yorkers share and we share with our neighbors across our state lines so I just wanted t o share that with you. 19 JEFF KRAUT: Thanks Dr. Brown. And yes, Ms. Rautenb urg, was there another question here? Ms. Rautenburg the n Mr. LaRue. ELLEN RAUTENBURG: I just wanted to compliment - JEFF KRAUT: And then Dr. Martin, I'm sorry. ELLEN RAUTENBURG: I just wanted to compliment Dr. Zucker, the Department, and the advocates for the reproduct ive health replacement of the Title 10 money to make sure that low income women continue to receive reproductive health servi ces and abortions and referrals to abortions across the sta te. JEFF KRAUT: Mr. LaRue and then Dr. Martin. SCOTT LARUE: Good morning, Dr. Zucker. I don't kno w, maybe Keith was going to address it but DSRIP II, i s there any update on the likelihood or any progress towards an agreement on the second round of DSRIP? HOWARD ZUCKER: So, I'll have Keith, if he's here, address it. 20 GLENN MARTIN: Yes, Good morning. I get the play th e role of Debbie Downer. I was actually curious - thank yo u for the musical background. Nice. Corona Virus question; it may actually be too granular and be happy to wait for an answer. Obviously one of the concerns of a global pandemic if it turn s into that is the supply chain. And we already see disruptions of supply chains of humans as flights are being canceled and the like, and one of the concerns we have is that the United Stat es doesn't manufacture a whole lot of anything useful in terms of mask, gowns, gloves, etc. Also some pharmaceuticals, as y ou know. So one of the real concerns is that if things slow dow n internationally, is we won't have the supplies we n eed in order to treat it. And I know this is well known. I'm jus t curious, does New York State have stock piles that they have developed and are hopefully somewhere I have no idea where th ey are, etc., etc., or are we dependent on the national governmen t. HOWARD ZUCKER: We have an incredible stockpile, an d I've had an opportunity to take a tour of that stockpile that Mike Primo our emergency management team watches, and so we do have supplies available. And if there are problems, we c an tap into that. 21 GARY KALKUT: I want to thank you for your comments about the (no audio) And depleted it to stick with infection control an d public health principles when we approach something where there's a lot of unknowns. And I think that needs to be our focus . Look at what there are long standing principles about how d isease is transmitted and we need to stick with what we know while making sure that we take into account a number of the feat ures and potential of this illness now. But the flu is still here and the flu affects many many people in the United States. JEFF KRAUT: Any other questions for Dr. Zucker? Wi th that, I'd - anybody else? KEVIN WATKINS: Dr. Zucker, I just want to commend you and your staff for outstanding leadership on this novel Corona Virus as we have learned that this is quite fluid, but yo u guys have really shown local public health directors and comm issioners. You've taken the lead on this, and we really want t o just commend you and your staff for all the hard work th at you have done. I know we met on Saturday, we met on Sunday, you have had - you've given us as much information as you possib ly could as this has been very fluid, but we cannot commend you enough for the leadership that you, Brad Hutton, and the Depar tment has 22 given us in trying to combat this new virus that we have out here. Thank you very much. HOWARD ZUCKER: Thank you. And it is - the Departme nt does an amazing job and I publicly want to thank everyon e in the Department, up in Albany and down here. It is just an amazing group of an incredibly talented individuals who ded icate to public health, and any time we have any crisis, whe ther it's this or measles or flu and the list goes on, when e veryone gets together it's just a sort of so well orchestrated i t's like a beautiful dance of how everything gets done. And I really am thrilled with everyone and it's a privilege to lead such an excellent team. JEFF KRAUT: Thank you Dr. Watkins. Thank you Dr. Z ucker. And I'll just close by saying, unfortunately it tak es us a crisis to focus in and talk about the benefits and support for public health and the zeal that we show today has t o sustain when a crisis wains and our memories fail, and that 's why, if the people in this room, outside of this room do no t speak up for public health, then who will? And we have to re mind ourselves as it's the dollars are tougher for a var iety of reasons. This is something that a small benefit of drinking water, you know, infection control, has massive ben efit from a 23 population health. You talk about population health , public health is the original population health strategy. And again, just to remind everybody as every opportunity I've taken is within the Department of Health the jewel that is W adsworth Laboratory, and the need for us to make sure that t hat is well- supported and available not only in times of crisis . So, thank you again, and we all have a job to do outside of t his room. With that, hey Brad, you can't get a better introd uction than that. If you'd like to give - If I do say so m yself. If you'd like to give us an update on the office of pu blic health, that you haven't done already. BRAD HUTTON: I'm really happy to do that. Thanks D r. Zucker and Dr. Watkin and others for those great s upportive comments. I'm going to cover three items today. I w anted to give you a really brief update on our rulemaking for dri nking water, maximum contaminant levels. I'd like to promote and mention a comprehensive slate of tobacco control proposals th at are in the executive budget, but I'd like to go into a little bit more detail on all the activities that we have underway over the last couple of weeks in response to the novel Coronaviru s. So briefly just because you've been really involved in the dri nking water NCLs, we did on January 22nd published in the state register a 24 notice of revised rulemaking for a 45-day public co mment. To make some revisions to the approach we were taking in the establishment of Maximum contaminant levels for tho se emerging contaminants, PFOA, PFOS and 1-4 dioxane. We did h ave a meeting of our drinking water quality council this week and we are working to respond to some questions and I think so me misunderstandings that might be out there with resp ect to our proposed revisions. We are hoping to resolve those and resume our movement full speed ahead and anticipate that w ill be back in front of you for your April meeting with a recom mendation for a notice of adoption so that you can move forward a nd put in place a requirement for testing and really just con tinue to lead the nation with respect to emerging contaminants in drinking water. Second was Tobacco Control. I am really prou d to say that we have a really comprehensive state of proposals i n the executive budget this year both responding to the e pidemic of Youth use of e-cigarettes in response to our respir atory illness vaping crisis. And then also just continuing our ef fort with tobacco control. And so those include a Prohibition on the sale of flavored e-cigs to take up where this body has l eft off with respect to emergency regs and make permanent a flav ored prohibition. one that would ban the sale of all tob acco products in pharmacies. Third item would be to clarify that the department has authority to prohibit the sale of ce rtain carrier 25 oils. You might remember that Wadsworth was instrum ental in identifying that the vitamin E acetate oil was a po tential ingredient of concern that may have been part of Th e Vaping crisis this past fall and we want to make very clea r that we could take through rulemaking actions to prohibit c arrier oils in the future. A fourth item is to create some new clarification in the public health law around Clean Indoor Air Ac t related to defining an indoor space with respect to gaming facilities. Fifth item is to prohibit the shipping of vapor products. you obviously know that you thought often times obtain products through the mail and so this would expand the existing prohibition on shipping tobacco products to include vaping products. One that would prohibit the use of price reduction instruments or coupon that are ways that the tobacc o industry uses to get around the high tax that we have here i n New York state. Again trying to work to prevent youth initia tion. A seventh item would be a display ban on all tobacco products to address the powerwall that we all encounter that we go into convenience stores and see all the advertisements t he tobacco industry has. And eighth is to prohibit the adverti sing of Vapor Products and media Outlets that are targeted to you th. A ninth item is to require The Vaping industry to disclose the ingredients in their products. And then attend is t o increase the long-standing penalties that have been in place as part of 26 the adolescence youth prevention Act to have higher fines and also longer suspensions in those instances where a retailer is found to allow youths to purchase any tobacco produ ct. And finally I want to go back to the novel Coronavirus. We have really been heavily engaged in the response to this virus really for several weeks now. We activated our Incident Ma nagement System which is the way that we organize the depart ment in response to emergencies. We activated that approxim ately two weeks ago and have been having daily meetings. We w ere very busy beginning last Friday when the White House task for ce on the novel Coronavirus announced three important actions that were being taken nationally to protect the United States from having additional imported cases from China. Those three a ctivities include a ban on travel by any foreign National int o the US who was recently traveled into China. A second item is to require mandatory quarantine for anyone returning into the US who has recently traveled in Hubei Province, that's the Pro vince in China that's been most widely impacted by this nove l Coronavirus. And a third is to require home isolati on and active monitoring for anyone returning to the US who has t raveled anywhere in mainland China. So as Dr. Zucker and Dr . Watkins mentioned, our department staff really worked here through the evenings and the weekend to work closely with Feder al officials and the Centers for Disease Control and prevention and our 27 partners and local government to refine how those a ctions were going to be implemented, and I think we've made a l ot of progress here this week. Already identifying indivi duals who have returned into JFK. I should mention the other important action the federal government took is to funnel all passengers returning from China into initially 7 now 11 intern ational airports. And then the federal government is perfor ming a temperature and symptom screen on people as they en ter into the country and potentially flag either from mandatory quarantine or four subsequent follow-up by a local health departm ent anyone who is subject to the home isolation and active mon itoring. Yesterday the department issued guidance to local H ealth departments. We call it our movement restriction an d monitoring guidance. so this details the different risk categ ories that would warrant that an individual needs to be put un der quarantine or underactive monitoring. We also along with that issued what we call isolation and quarantine guidan ce. This gets into the specific activities that local Health depa rtments undertake to assess whether or not first the dwelli ng of an individual is appropriate for home isolation. Is it appropriately protective from potential spread? Is it a dwelling that could support a quarantine or home isolation f or 14 days? And then also to establish other quarantine locatio ns if needed, if those locations don't - are unacceptable. We rea lly worked 28 with a lot of other partners to implement these act ions and also to educate them about being responsive to the novel Coronavirus. Today we're issuing a letter to P through 12 school s across New York State. Dr. Zucker jointly with the commissione r of the State education department. Also will have a letter to parents. We'll be issuing similar guidance to childcare faci lities around the state. We've had regular calls with our univers ity partners since many universities and colleges in New York st ate have international students or visiting professors or ju st other members of the community who have recently traveled to China. We'll be having another webinar for that group this week or early next week. We have twice a week partner calls with our hospital association's. Our physician associations. The university associations. And many others to keep th em up-to-date and briefed on this really dynamic and rapidly chan ging situation. It really is a success that thus far we have 12 cases in the United States only. We expect to continue to receive sporadic confirmed cases in the United States. I th ink the fact that we have so few at this point is really a resul t of the travel actions that have been taken on the part of the Chinese government and the United States government to rest rict travel. And you should all know that the State Health Depar tment, the city department of health and mental hygiene and 57 local Health departments are extremely well-prepared and experie nce and 29 responding to the novel respiratory pathogen. We ha ve plans in place. We drill on them. And we have experienced im plementing them. And so right now the focus is to rapidly iden tify any confirmed cases in New York state immediately isola te any contacts they have and have them under movement res trictions so that any secondary cases that occur, occur among pe ople who are under monitoring and isolation. So that we are able to limit spread and really contain that transmission chain a nd stop it. And really that's the mode that we're in in respons e to this virus in the United States, and you should all know that we are all really well-prepared and experienced said that. That's it. JEFF KRAUT: Thank you Mr. Hutton. Are there questi ons? Any questions? OK. Thank you very much. I'm now goi ng to turn it over to Dr. Gutierrez, who is going to give the rep ort on Codes, Regulation, and Legislation. ANGEL GUTIERREZ: Good morning again. Thank you ver y much. I'm Angel Gutierrez. I chair the committee on codes, regulation and legislation. We met this morning and we passed two proposals for emergency, two for adoption and o ne for information. For emergency adoption and information is the 30 prohibition of the sale of electronic liquids with characterizing flavors. This proposal adds subpart 9-3 to Title 10 and prohibits any individual or entity to proces s, manufacture, distribute, sell, or offer for sale an y flavor e- liquid or product containing the same. The committe e voted unanimously to recommend emergency adoption to the Full Council and I so move. JEFF KRAUT: Motion. Do I have a second? Dr. Watkin s. Any questions or comments? ANGEL GUTIERREZ: We have Dr. Wallace available to answer questions or comments. JEFF KRAUT: Yes, Ms. Monroe. ANN MONROE: Can I just verify that this is for a r eup on the emergency regulation that we had, and is not a permanent regulation that we are considering, is that accurat e? ANGEL GUTIERREZ: Yes. It is accurate. This is not a permanent regulation. This is an emergency. 31 JEFF KRAUT: And which is pending resolution in the courts and in the event the courts rule, it would c ome back to us for permanent, when it's permanent. Any other qu estions? Hearing none, all those in favor, aye? [Aye] Opposed? Two opposed. Abstentions? The motion carr ies. ANGEL GUTIERREZ: To reiterate what we said before, note, that this proposal will be presented again at a fut ure meeting for regular adoption, if it comes to that. The next is for emergency adoption and information , communicable diseases reporting and control adding severe or novel Coronary [sic] Virus. This proposal amends se ction 2.1 and 2.5 of Title 10 to add severe and novel Coronal Vir us to the reportable list of infectious contagious, or commun icable diseases for systematic monitoring. The committee v oted unanimously to recommend a emergency adoption to th e Full Council, and I so move. JEFF KRAUT: I have a motion. May I have a second? Second, Dr. Torres. Any questions? Hearing none, al l those in favor? 32 [Aye] Opposed? Abstention? The motion carries. ANGEL GUTIERREZ: Again as I mentioned for the prev ious one, this will come back for presentation at a futu re meeting for regular adoption. For adoption was the topic of physician-limited pe rmit holder requirements. This proposal will repeal sect ion 405.4 subsection G, paragraph 2, subparagraphs I, III in order to eliminate the extra years of training beyond what i s required for licensure limited permit for domestic and inter national limited permit holders to work in New York State ho spitals. The committee voted to recommend adoption to the Full C ouncil and I so move. JEFF KRAUT: I have a motion. May I have a second? Dr. Watkins. Any questions? All those in favor, aye. [Aye] Opposed? Abstention? The motion carries. ANGEL GUTIERREZ: Also for adoption, this licensed homecare services agencies. This proposal will amen d part 765-1 regarding licensed homecare services agencies, refe rred to as 33 LHCSAs and would establish a criteria for a public need review for initial licensure applications and change of ow nership applications received on or after April 1, 2020. Th e committee voted to recommend adoption to the Full Council and I so move. JEFF KRAUT: We have a motion. May I have a second, Dr. Torres. Any questions about this? All those in favo r, aye? [Aye] Opposed? The motion carries. ANGEL GUTIERREZ: Last and for information only is reducing annual tuberculosis testing for health car e workers. The proposal amendment will eliminate serial testin g and focus on evaluating individual risk and encouraging treat ment for persons with untreated latent tuberculosis infectio n which reflect current CDC recommendation. Since the propo sal was presented for information there was no vote. This c oncludes my remarks, Mr. Chair. JEFF KRAUT: Thank you very much. Any questions abo ut anything we did or any other issue on legislation a nd codes? OK, I'll now turn it over to Dr. Boufford to give her r eport on the activities of the public health committee. 34 JO BOUFFORD: My report is really extracted from th e annual report of the council. I just wanted to hit a few highlights. First of all let me thank the committee and whose names are in the report if you look at them as well . As Commissioner Zucker and Brad Hutton and Laura centr ally who has taken over from Sylvia Pirani with smooth and with out hiccups which has been really great in terms of supporting our work. And again I think just judging from the discussion this morning thank the council for its support for the populatio n Health agenda. I think our stalwart chair and others has b een really really supportive of the work here. So we really ap preciate it. A couple of highlights. The prevention agenda 2019 to 2024 is underway. You approved it in December of 2018 so that process that you are pretty familiar with his underway. I w anted to mention sort of good news that one, the vision awar d from the association state maternal health officers for the very highly inclusive ad-hoc prevention agenda process working across sectors and across disciplines and departments in g overnment in this past year. So we are very proud of that. And I think Laura went down and accepted it on Howard's behalf. The o ther is we are now thanks to the executive order of the Govern or in December of 2018 really able to work and encourage and to some degree mandated but I think people have been quite excited and 35 enthusiastic about working across all the agencies in the state and have been an executive order by the Governor to instruct all agencies to look at the health impact and the age f riendliness if you will of their policies, programs, and their purchasing and contracting, which is the really really importa nt part of that. And that process has been moving thanks to th e group tearing of the cross agency group by Commissioner Z ucker and I always like to call out Paul Francis who has been w ith us from the beginning as secretary for Health and Human Ser vices for the Governor in beginning this process. The group met i n January right after the executive order was passed this pas t year and have been looking to integrate the health across al l policies with the agencies with the sort of formal domains o f age friendliness as defined by the World Health Organi zation and supported by the AARP. So it's quite integrated int o the prevention agenda. We're focusing all of our goals on people of all ages in the state and there's also been I think the support of the John Hartford Foundation looking and support ing working with the commissioner on age friendly public health initiatives as well as a matronly hospitals in other areas of w ork. So all of that is working very very well together. There h as been to cross agency meetings in the past and we hope to ha ve another one early in this year. 36 There was a population health summit in February o f 2019 in the midst of a driving snowstorm here in Albany. Attended by 700 people from all around the state. We're really looking at issues of the prevention agenda and public health a nd also featuring presentations by other agencies who are v ery important to health. and I think some of the agencies that ha ve been most active both joining the ad hoc leadership group and in our work are obviously office of mental hygiene and OASAS a nd department or office - I always quote by the city's name I'm s orry - the Office for the Aging here in the state have been co re members really of the prevention agenda effort from the ve ry beginning because the goals effect impact on their work. But we've also added ag and markets has been really active. Parks, recreation, historic preservation, the energy department agency has been fantastic. Really looking at energy savings, indoor housing, greeness and other things -- really involved. And the Department of State with it's very very important E conomic Development opportunities through the regional econ omic development councils and the development zones for cities. Paul Beyer and his boss have been fabulous in giving inc entives to communities to apply for these grant programs givin g waiting heavily if they really can do a health-promoting or age-friendly project. 37 The committee continues to work with the health pla nning committee especially looking at the implementation of the CON conditions, wanting to look at what the particular applicant is doing In the prevention agenda area starting with a cute facilities. We hope over the next months to expand into various ambulatory care and the long-term care report would also include looking at what that looks like for age fr iendliness as well from those institutions. Obviously you've been hearing about infectious diseases and vaping a lot and we l eave that to the experts and have been watching that with great support. The maternal mortality report that this Council approve d a couple of years ago has really morphed into a maternal mortal ity commission of the Governor and is pursuing its agen da and our public health committee - we had original initial r eport in one of our first meetings this year and will be just se eing how that's going, how the implementation is going with the commission and also a particular interest of the pu blic health committee and the council had been pre-hospital, so rt of the organization of pre-hospital maternity services and early identification of high-risk women. I think the focu s of hospital emergency management is very advanced and a lot of interesting proposals that are being looked at by the commissio n for not being looked at, being implemented on workforce dev elopment but we are still very interested in the pre-hospital si de of it. And 38 will be getting a report on that hopefully in the n ext month or two. And then since maternal mortality has really p icked up by the Governor's commission, the committee has decide d to take on one other item aside from its involvement in the ad hoc leadership group and oversight of the prevention ag enda and now the health across all and age friendly are taking o n violence in the context of violence prevention and the context of the prevention agenda. We began our work on this in Jun e, had an earlier meeting, and we're using the, Really the gr eat expertise we've had great briefings from the department, from the health department and the various areas on just about ever ything we've been looking at especially at gun violence but also at suicide, homicide rates, opioid addiction, and others just s till looking at the general area and feel beginning to hone in o n what we are going to focus on. We've also been bringing in othe r agencies. Obviously the core agencies I mentioned earlier, OM H, OASAS, DOS, State Office of the Aging, but also office of Children and Family Services, domestic violence victim services, and we had a meeting in December where are we and also invited p anel for the New York State Police Department of the Department of Labor and the Department of Criminal Justice Services. So we have another meeting scheduled. These are all our fact-finding e fforts. And I think in the spirit of wanting to make a differenc e with the things we could have leverage over and not duplicat ing efforts 39 by other agencies, the group is we're being very de liberate about this process. We had hoped to have a meeting yesterday but for various reasons I think attendance for reasons and also our ability to attend actually and the ability of our l atest round of invitees, our sort of last group of panelists we re not able to be there. We are looking for another meeting lat er this month. and after that we'll be developing recommen dations about how we want to how we want to pursue the violence p revention issues in the context of the prevention agenda we w ill be bringing that to you for discussion probably at the March or April meeting. And then once we get the okay, we wi ll move ahead and go back and start implementing as we did with t he maternal mortality work. So again just to thank everyone, an d I think our goal of making New York to healthiest State plus or minus some infectious diseases is still on contract here is ho w we really appreciate your support. Thank you. JEFF KRAUT: Questions, comments for Dr. Boufford's report? I gotta - actually a Department of Health q uestion but it's related to the health in all policies. I was r eading - the State put out requests for proposals to develop on surplus land in central Brooklyn housing, but to connect that ho using to healthcare. And encouraging that the first floor of that housing kind of house expansion of FQHC, D&T centers, CONS, and I'm just 40 wondering you know, if you get something like that where it comes out of this health in all polies initiative, do you have a way to kind of identify it and fast track the appro vals or you know, take as much friction or hassle out of it so those kind of novel initiatives kind of go to the front, and mayb e get into a different swim lane? Just because you want to encou rage those. You want to incent it in some way. And that include s not only from a regulatory from the preopening surveys to ge tting them up and running and helping them out. So if it's not on your radar, I just suggest it's a good policy. JO BOUFFORD: I think it's part of the vital Brookl yn program which from the beginning was designed to tr y to integrate healthcare and housing and broader determ inants of health, food services systems and others. I think i t's a good question about expediting, I haven't - it's tough t o expedite there but I think I'm going to lateral that over to the Commissioner. HOWARD ZUCKER: I'm going to put it over to the leg al issues to see if we could do that. JO BOUFFORD: Conceptually it's been a part of that initiative from the beginning. 41 RICK ZAHNLEUTER: This is Rick Zahnleuter, general counsel. There is a way with DSRIP to expedite thin gs and smooth over regulatory obstacles. But for something like t his the best we can do is to put something at the top of a list or top of a pile. JEFF KRAUT: Listen, I'm just saying that we're try ing - we're just trying. So anything that helps. And just be mindful, and that was it. I'd love to see\u2014I don't think they 're at the end of the process of selecting the developers, but those are, those kind of relationships hold great promise beca use housing first. If they don't have a place to live you're go ing to have a hard time providing healthcare. That just what we a ll know. JO BOUFFORD: It's a really interesting question an d maybe we could pursue it a little bit more because there' s a lot of effort nationally looking at the important role of hospitals as anchor institutions in their communities in terms o f their usually being the largest employer, buying local, t he potential for economic development. A lot of interest now in zero energy green hospitals and other things, and we really hav en't maybe connecting the dots going forward if we could do th at and expedite some of these obstacles maybe it might be in the way of 42 hospitals that really want to move in that directio n. I mean, ultimately the reimbursement system is the key ques tion, but I think there's much that can be done in that area an d many are doing things around the state. So maybe we'll try t o start looking at that if we could. That'd be great. JEFF KRAUT: Thank you. Any other comments or quest ions? Thank you very much Dr. Boufford. And thank you aga in for agreeing to serve as vice-chair and head up all thi s significant work. Speaking of other significant work, I'll now turn it over to Mr. Robinson to provide a report of the project review recommendations and establishment actions. PETER ROBINSON: Thank you very much Mr. Kraut. I t hink I'd like to begin by acknowledging the great work o f the committee, especially at the last meeting. I though t we had a very very constructive dialog. Members of the commi ttee were absolutely fabulous there. I want to thank the Depa rtment for all the work they did to get us ready and provide i nput to us, and in particular, I'd like to thank the public. I thought this was, this committee meeting we had particularly aro und the Mt. Sinai project, but just generally, I thought the qu ality and the level of input that we got from the public and the influence 43 that had on the outcome of that conversation partic ularly around that project was terrific. And I just wanted to ack nowledging everybody in the theme of acknowledging people. And activities. So that went well. So, as Mr. Kraut said, I will be batching the appl ications according to categories. And will immediately jump off of that to take one application out of context. So this fir st batch relates to the cardiac cath labs. Freestanding labs , PCI services. The first one we'll take out of context b ecause of a conflict and recusal by Ms. Soto. Is application 19 2063C, Jacoby Medical Center in Bronx County. This is to certify the cardiac cath lab and PCI services for that organization. Th e Department is recommending approval with a condition as did th e committee and I so move. JEFF KRAUT: I have a motion, I have a second by Dr . Gutierrez. PETER ROBINSON: I apologize and not announcing Dr. Yang's conflict and recusal as well for this applic ation. JEFF KRAUT: Dr. Yang was out of the room when you made the motion. Ms. Soto is out of the room as well. We have a 44 motion. We have a second. Do we have any comments f rom the department? TRACY RALEIGH: Just questions. JEFF KRAUT: Any questions from the council? All th ose in favor, aye. [Aye] Opposed? Abstentions? The motion carries. Please a sk - PETER ROBINSON: No, Dr. Yang needs to stay out. JEFF KRAUT: Dr. Yang needs to stay out. Ms. Soto c an come back in. PETER ROBINSON: Application 182006C, Coney Island Hospital in Kings County. This is to also certify a cardiac cath lab and PCI services as well as to install requisit e equipment. The Department recommends approval with a condition and contingency as does the committee, and I so move. 45 JEFF KRAUT: I have a motion and second by Dr. Guti errez. Any questions for the Department or any comments? A ll those in favor, aye. [Aye] Opposed? Abstentions? The motion carries. Ms Soto can return. Ms. Soto's here. Sorry. Dr. Yang can return . PETER ROBINSON: So the following are now being bat ched. 191306C, St. Joseph Hospital in Nassau County. This is to certify cardiac cath and PCI services with requisit e renovations and equipment acquisition to accompany, to accommod ate one catheterization laboratory. Application 191308C, Mercy Medical Center in Nassa u County. Certify a cardiac cath lab with PCI services in add ition to it's existing adult diagnostic cardiac cath and electrop hysiology laboratory services. Application 192161C, Upstate University Hospital a t Community General in Onondaga County. To certify th erapeutic radiology services and perform renovations to creat e an infusion center. Application 192244C, United Health Services Hospit als Inc., Wilson Medical Center in Broome County to construct a new six story building to expand the emergency department, add an MRI 46 unit and services, create a new 30 bed all private room medical surgical unit and add shell space for the future de velopment of additional private rooms. In each of these the Depa rtment is recommending approval with conditions and contingen cies, as does the committee. And I so move. JEFF KRAUT: I have a motion, I have a second Dr. Gutierrez. Any questions for the Department? All th ose in favor, aye. [Aye] Opposed? Abstentions? The motion carries. PETER ROBINSON: I'm now calling two applications b oth of which have recusals by Mr. Kraut and Dr. Strange . Back on. These two are batched and again conflict recusal by Mr. Kraut and Dr. Strange. Application 151185C, Wycoff Heigh ts Medical Center in Kings County. This certifies cardiac cath and PCI services and converts an existing diagnostic labora tory into a PCI capable laboratory. And application 192093C, Le nnox Health Greenwich Village in New York County. Certifying ca rdiac catheterization PCI and EP services with requisite construction and transfer six medical surgical beds from Lennox Hill hospital. And application 172332C, Plainview Hospit al in Nassau 47 County. To certify cardiac cath PCI and EP services with requisite renovation to construct a cardiac cath su ite. In each of these three the Department is recommending appro val with condition and contingencies as does the committee, and I so move. JO BOUFFORD: Motion, and seconded. Just for the re cord Mr. Kraut and Dr. Strange are both recused from the third application and neither of them is in the room. Any questions or comments from the council on these three applicatio ns? All in favor? [aye] Opposed? Abstaining? Ok, the motion is passed. Can invite our colleagues back into the room. PETER ROBINSON: OK, this is an application for hos pice services construction. 192159C, Chautauqua Hospice and Palliative care in Chautauqua County. I'm going to note that Dr. Watkins has declared a conflict and left the room. Also noting there is an interest declared by Mr. Holt who inten ds to abstain from the application vote. This is to acquire adjoi ning property and renovate to certify a five bed hospice resident ial unit and supporting facilities. The Department recommended a pproval with 48 conditions and contingencies as does the committee, and I so move. JEFF KRAUT: I have a motion, I have a second Dr. Gutierrez. Any questions on this application? All t hose in favor, aye. [Aye] Opposed? Abstentions? The motion carries. PETER ROBINSON: I apologize. I have to ask Mr. Kra ut and Dr. Strange to leave the room again. Application 182119C, John T. Mather Memorial Hospi tal of Port Jefferson New York Inc., in Suffolk County. Ce rtifying cardiac catheterization PCI and EP services and per forming renovations to create two cardiac catheterization l abs. The Department recommends approval with conditions and contingencies. The committee recommended approval w ith conditions and contingencies with one member in opp osition. I so move the application. JO BOUFFORD: I have a motion and a second on this application. Comments? Questions? All in favor? 49 [Aye] Opposed? Abstentions? Motion passes. Can I just - I just was noticing and maybe it's al ways been like this, but the specificity of the construction programs isn't stipulated in the agenda any longer. Cardiac cath versus renal dialysis. I think that would be really helpfu l for those of us who are not on the establishment committee to help us go back into the specifics. Because they're all so sor t of look a like if we don't call out what they're for. Just wh en they're being batched, for the purpose of the application I think would be really helpful. PETER ROBINSON: Thank you for that suggestion. I s ay thank you. I'm assuming that's OK with the Departme nt. Thank you. So this is category six which is applications for individual consideration. This is application 19204 7C, the Mt. Sinai-Beth Israel application for New York County. I recall there were two applications here, one for the hospi tal itself and one for the behavioral health services, so I'll take these separately. I'm going to note a conflict and recusa l on both of these applications by Dr. Martin who is leaving the room. I do want to note that in making my motion here, the com mittee 50 recommended approval with certain added conditions which were erroneously identified as contingencies. So as thos e conditions, I go through them, I just want to make sure that's the way I'm making the motion to rectify that and to identify t hese conditions as conditions rather than contingencies. So that's my prelude here. This is construct a replacement hospi tal and relocate the facility to 302 E. 14 th Street in Manhattan with a decrease in beds and services. The companion to CON 192049C which we will take up next. So the Department and t he committee recommend contingent approval with three added cond itions, and these are the conditions that I was talking about j ust before. Within 90 days from the date of the contingent appr oval letter, the applicant shall submit a written communication plan acceptable to the Department that would help patien ts navigate the evolving and transforming health system in the Mt. Sinai- Beth Israel service area. I want to thank both the committee and the members of the public for bringing that out, Ms . Monroe particularly for making that point. Second, no late r than 90 days prior to the relocation of services to the new site on E. 14 th Street, the applicant shall provide a comprehensiv e transition plan including a communication plan acce ptable to the Department. And third, within 18 months from the da te of the contingent approval letter, the applicant shall sub mit documentation acceptable to the Department of the a pplicant's 51 exploration of the possibility of opening a birthin g center which at the minimum shall include a business feasi bility study, review of potential site locations, review of poten tial quality and safety concerns and consideration of governance models. So all of those conditions came out of the conversatio n that we had at the committee. So again, I want to thank the com mittee for their input. Want to thank the public, and actually I want to thank the applicant in this conversation as well fo r their flexibility, willing to listen, and to make some co mpromises here. So with that, the Department is recommending approval with conditions and contingencies. The committee also ap proved with conditions and contingencies with one member opposi ng. I make the motion for that approval. JEFF KRAUT: I have a motion, may I have a second? Dr. Gutierrez. Dr. Boufford. JO BOUFFORD: I have a question. I read the materia ls coming in which I agree the discussion, it sounds l ike the discussion and the materials were really very compr ehensive, very informed by everyone involved. The one area th at got a bit of a glancing mention is explicit plans for primary care, for availability of primary care. I know there was sort of elimination of pediatric primary care at the outset , and I 52 wanted to ask if in the discussion of the committee there was a more explicit - I'd love to see some plan required to come in at some point, but I think if there was a discussion o f the availability primary care in addition to the inform ation transportation. PETER ROBINSON: I do believe there was robust discussion of about the expansion of ambulatory ser vices broadly, and I do believe that included primary car e. But pardon me? I do believe that that included a significant i ncrease in primary care. Ms. Raleigh, do you want to comment o n that to see if I have that correct? TRACY RALEIGH: That's correct. As this is Tracy Ra leigh from the Department. Both the Department and Mt. Si nai in their presentation noted that as part of this is really a billion dollar investment when you look at the investment i n the new hospital, that's the project before the council as well as the investment that's not part of the project in their network development in lower Manhattan. There is a investme nt in primary care as well as other ambulatory care sites. So tha t was noted. JEFF KRAUT: So just a point - Dr. Boufford, well, you want to make the distinction? Because I heard what you said. 53 JO BOUFFORD: It may be included. I just want to be clear. Ambulatory care services are multiple types. Primar y care used to be at least what held the pieces together. But I think primary care is distinct from specialty services. T hey're both important and they're both really important in the ambulatory area but I was really interested more because theor etically that is the primary care practices are the first line an d then get people appropriately into specialty services or ref erred to hospital. So that's why I was emphasizing primary c are and not the others which I did read and were quite clear. JEFF KRAUT: But I think they had, it was several hundred, a few hundred thousand visits that include d primary care that is part of the network that is continued to be maintained. It's just not going to be delivered wit hin the walls of the hospital. TRACY RALEIGH: Just for clarity\u2014 JEFF KRAUT: The subject was the hospital and not the primary are, the network. 54 TRACY RALEIGH: That's correct. The network that I' m speaking of is not just specialty services. It's a network consisting of primary care base as well as specialt y and ambulatory. PETER ROBINSON: If I recall, they announced the nu mber of some 600 practices in total. And significant sub set of that was primary care. Is that - TRACY RALEIGH: That's correct. So it includes priv ate practicing physicians that are associated with the Mt. Sinai Network. JEFF KRAUT: Any other comments? Yes, Ms. Carver Ch eney. KATHLEEN CARVER CHENEY: Along those lines there wa s concern expressed about the emergency room and espe cially for pediatrics. So will there be sufficient pediatric e mergency room care under the new plan? TRACY RALEIGH: Yes, the emergency department plan was the subject of much discussion and rightly so. We, the department spent a lot of time with Mt. Sinai looking at the e mergency department plans. The plans to include a main ED on the first 55 floor as well as a separate area for pediatric emer gency as well as a separate area for psychiatric emergency. So, I don't know if that answers your question. HOWARD BERLINER: Thank you. I'm going to vote agai nst this application and I'd like to take a minute to e xplain why. And basically it comes down to three reasons. Lower Manhattan as defined by the Department, as below 34 th Street gets one of the largest surges of population during the day probabl y of any place in the United States if not the world. We hav e already taken out of lower Manhattan a vast number, very hi gh number of acute care beds. I am weary of reducing the number of acute care beds in lower Manhattan by almost 500. 70 beds does not seem to me to be an adequate size for an acute care hospita l serving the large number of patients that it has to serve. And I say this in full agreement with the trends that we are using fe wer hospital beds and things like that, although I would note th at in most other countries in the world, certainly in Europe, more beds per population, longer lengths of stay, and much cheape r. We found in this country we reduce length of stay, and we re duce beds, costs go up and especially prices go up. Secondly t he emergency room which today is overcrowded. It's going to be i ncreased in size which is good, but I'm not sure it's going to be increased in size again, enough to make up for the lack of ac ute care beds 56 in the area. Great to have primary care clinics and to have practice plans and other specialty units. Those don 't operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We're in the midst of c ertainly cautious time around what's going to happen with th e novel Coronavirus perhaps other viruses, perhaps other ki nds of things. This being essentially the only major emerg ency room - no offense Jeff - in that area of Manhattan is just scary. And the third thing is birthing centers are great. We'v e had very few in the city. We've put such severe restrictions on them. I don't think - I think this is a nice thing to do. I don't think this is an answer. This is a hospital that has hist orically drawn patients not just from lower Manhattan but al so from norther Brooklyn and essentially eastern I guess Qu eens. You know, those are areas that are growing in populatio n. So I'm just weary about where those patients from those ar eas will go to get their care. So, those are my reasons. JEFF KRAUT: So, I think we could go through, we're not going to relitgate or rehear the issues, and I unde rstand the concerns. One of the thing I did when I heard the m aterial, I went back and I looked at the area below 34 th street in lower Manhattan and what I learned is it's an important f acility and it's going to continue to be because they're making a billion dollar investment. And you're saying that's not eno ugh, at some 57 level, just saying there's an entity, they're looki ng at systems of care, and what I learned is 74 percent of the pe ople who live below 34 th Street choose not to go to Beth Israel and seek th eir care elsewhere. And I recognize that. And this goes back to the presentation you made at the retreat if I could thr ow your own data back in your face, about the changing nature, a hospitals are going to be defined differently in the future. They're going to play different roles and they're going to reorga nize in different configurations based on economics, based on technology, based on consumer preference. We could prop up a hospital - we've propped up many losing hospitals, this is not one of them although it has its own financials, whe re we could prop it up but he community decides to go elsewhere , but there is very clearly a community that's dependent on thi s hospital and it's an important hospital. And we're not sugge sting - the reason I'm suggesting this to support it is because I see a brand new hospital being dealt. I see capacity of t he emergency room, I think it was validated at about 90000, thre e times the size of the current emergency room which is undersi zed and not a good standard to compare it to. I see new beds bein g invested that are single bedded that meet a different need p articularly here. So it's half full or half empty. And I'll tak e the narrative that Dr. Gutierrez said, I would say that this is a positive narrative even with it's recognized shortc omings. I 58 recognize, I wish, everybody wishes they could do m ore. Everybody wishes it could be bigger, everybody wish es it could be new things, but we're dealing with - we're not s ubstituting our judgement here for the planning. We're saying, is this needed. I think there's no question is the institut ion needed. Is this financially feasible? The project we were p resented is financially feasible. And does the applicant have t he character and competence to carry it out. And you apply those criteria and I think you reach the conclusion that the committee made. I love when we do this. This is like candy for me. HOWARD BERLINER: So, to reiterate what I said at t he committee meeting, when you take away most of the b eds in an area and then patients don't stay in that area, tha t's not choice. There's no way you can call that choice. It 's not that people are choosing to go uptown. It's that people have no other option. And secondly, this is something I've been t hinking about over the last two weeks, the billion dollars. Spend ing a billion dollars which even for Mt. Sinai is a lot of money, no question. But and all I kept thinking about was from the Aust in Powers movie when Dr. Evil says, I'm going to hold the wor ld ransom for a million dollars and everyone laughs at him becaus e he's been away for so long he doesn't know that that's meanin gless. What is a billion dollars in an over three trillion doll ar healthcare 59 system? I mean, yes, it's a lot of money but it's n ot - it's not the be all and end all. It is our job as members of this committee not to guarantee the bottom line of Mt. S inai although we certainly don't want it to go out of business, b ut to guarantee the healthcare for New Yorkers. And in th at case I don't think what they're proposing is an adequate, no question you could use a new building, no question eye and e ar is you know, a last century - not last century, but two ce nturies ago kind of building, but a 70 bed acute care hospital in a part of New York City which is you know, not getting which is growing in population and not losing population is just seems to me to be too little. JEFF KRAUT: So you'd rather have a St. Vincent's. You laugh, but let's face it. Inaction creates action. HOWARD BERLINER: That's not the only option for th em to say we're going to close the hospital. They can als o say, we're going to build 150 bed hospital, and then there wou ld be fewer complaints. JEFF KRAUT: But you're not the governance of that institution. We're offering an opinion, they're her e, they hear it, and I'm sure they had to debate these issues. 60 HOWARD BERLINER: But I'm a member of the council w ho has to approve and disapprove this. JEFF KRAUT: You're absolutely correct in doing tha t. Ms. Monroe then Dr. Gutierrez. ANN MONROE: I have a process question. To whom mus t Mt. Sinai, who must Mt. Sinai at the health department that it has done the conditions that we've asked? And because o f our strong investment in that discussion, is there a process w here we get to look at those things as well? So that's a proces s question. Maybe for you Tracy? TRACY RALEIGH: Sure. This is Tracy Raleigh and it' s a great question first off. So, these are construction proj ects so the Commissioner of Health ultimately approves the proj ects. The conditions that have been placed by this council on the project will first go through the layer of satisfaction of the staff of the Department of Health and then ultimately be pre sented to the Commissioner for final determination. So we, thinki ng, given the investment of this council in hearing the public's concerns and placing these conditions that it's appropriate for us to come back through our at the full PHHPC me etings as we 61 work with Mt. Sinai and we can report back on where we are in the valuation of the satisfaction to this council s o that you are aware as well as the public is aware. JEFF KRAUT: Yeah, I think we want the reporting to come back into the room. ANN MONROE: That's what I was hoping. And part of that report I would hope would include what they have pr esented to the Department. TRACY RALEIGH: Yes, absolutely. And in the timeframes that are denoted in the cond itions. ANGEL GUTIERREZ: This is hard to articulate. I dee ply respect Dr. Berliner's opinion, and I agree with ma ny of the principles you states. I also feel that there are n o roads where we are going. We don't know where we are moving to a large extent because the pace of change is anticipating o r moving ahead of what we're not prepared to deal with. You can - there is no way you can justify keeping beds open simply because something bad may happen. During the discussions at committee level what I sensed was that there was no articulat ion of effort or commonality of effort between those that were in favor of it 62 and those that were against it. It appears as thoug h they are not talking to each other. There was lack of unders tanding of terms that pro people were using. The people that w ere concerned or frightened by the decision to present the projec t were looking at the parameters that were no longer tenab le the way medicine is practiced today. The way public health is practiced today. I think that in a way, we as a council, need to prepare ourselves to put some other criteria in there which may look something like this and then just generating this. Has the applicant done everything that can be done to infor m the community it will be affected by this of what will happen in the future, of what the future will look like to them a nd have the affected population be part of the solution of the application. JEFF KRAUT: ... Ms. Monroe's conditions and I think that's an important part of it. GARY KALKUT: I also have a respect for Howard's ta ke on this and share some of the concerns. I think the qu estion of - let me finish - the question of ED capacity I think is a big one, and Jeff, the proviso not to relitigate, the p erformance that they've set a very high bar for the performanc e of that hospital and that has an impact on the number of be ds and how they're going to be used. And I think that is somet hing that we 63 need to follow and look at because having the lengt h of stay is quite a high target. HOWARD BERLINER: Can I just say, I feel like, God forbid, Mitt Romney. GARY KALKUT: Pretty soon you'll get the Erving Tha lberg award so watch it. JEFF KRAUT: OK, with that, I'll call a vote. All i n favor, aye [Aye] Opposed? Two? Motion carries.

PHL \u00a7\u00a7 3612(7) and 4662 authorize th e Commissioner to adopt and amend regulations to implement the purposes and provisi ons of PHL Articles 36 and 46 -B, respectively, including the establishment of uniform standar ds governing th e operation of l icensed home care services agencies (LHSCAs) and assist ed living residences (ALRs). Legislative Objectives: The legislative objectives of PHL Articles 28, 36, 40, and 46-B includes the protection of the health of the residents of t he State by assuring the effici ent provision of healt h services of the highest quality by a range of provi ders, including hospitals, h ospices, CHHAs, LHCSAs and ALRs. Needs and Benefits: Current requirements for annual tuberculosis screening in healt h care settings were established in the 1990s at the time of large outbreaks and sus tained transmission of tuberculosis in New York State (NYS). The req uirements were subsequently upd ated to allow use of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-appr oved blood tests as an alterna tive option to tuberculin skin 8tests, and to exempt certain pe rsonnel in non-clinical settings , but the serial te sting requirement was not changed. Over the past two decades, with improved infec tion control, diagnostic testing and treatment of persons with tube rculosis (TB) disease, incide nce has decreased. Evaluation of persons at risk for TB to detec t and treat laten t infection, in cluding contacts with infectious TB, is also ongoing in all settings inc luding health care facilitie s. Recent systematic reviews have documented that U.S. health care personnel have a low rate of TB infection on baseline testing and very low rate of t uberculin skin test conversions. Persons retested after apparent conversion in the absence of do cumented close contact to infectious tuberculosis were of ten negative on subsequent tests . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with the Nat ional Tuberculosis Controller s Association and in coordination with occupational health and infection control ass ociations, updated recommendations in 2019 which disc ourage routine serial testing , and instead focused on evaluating individual risk and enc ouraging treatm ent for person s with untreated latent tuberculosis infection. In NYS, providing universal annual tuberculosis education and i ndividual risk assessment, followed up as neede d with appropriate testing, cli nical evaluation, and encouragement of optimal treatme nt, is expected to benefit heal th care personnel, minimize risk of transmission from health car e personnel to others, and refoc us occupational health and infection control efforts. Thus, t he requirement to be tested \" no less than every year\" for negative findings is no longer necessary a nd is being eliminated from th ese regulations. Furthermore, in June 2019, CDC i ssued a Health Advisory providi ng notification of a nationwide shortage of one of the two purified protein derivati ve solution products for tuberculin skin testing. The CDC advisory a lso stated that annual TB test ing of health care personnel was 9not recommended unless there is a known exposure or ongoing tra nsmission. To align regulations with current best me dical practices and CDC guideli nes, and to prevent unnecessary disruption of health care provi ders, it is necessary to adopt t hese proposed regulations. Costs for the Implementation of and Continuing Compliance with these Regulations to the Regulated Entity: The proposed amendments will reduce requirements for testing of employees, and as such will result in a reduction in costs for regulated entities . Cost to State and Local Government: State agencies and local governme nt units that operate health c are facilities will see a reduction in costs associated with serial testing of employees. Cost to the Department of Health: The Department of Health will see a reduction in costs associat ed with serial testing of employees at health care facili ties operated by the Department. Local Government Mandates: This amendment does not impose any new programs, services, duti es or responsibilities on local government. Paperwork: 10 These amendments wi ll decrease the recor d keeping currently req uired of covered entities since annual testing will no longe r be required, only assessmen ts. Duplication: These amendments wi ll not conflict with any s tate or federal ru les. Alternative Approaches: An alternative would be to maintai n current requirements for r egular serial testing for TB. This is not advisable or practi cable given the current shortage of tuberculin skin testing solutions. Federal Requirements: These amendments reflect curre nt guidelines issued by the Cente rs for Disease Control and Prevention. Compliance Schedule: This proposal will go into effe ct upon publicatio n of a Notice of Adoption in the New York State Register. Contact Person: Ms. Katherine E.

Im pacted health care providers can consider using serial TB screen ing of certain g roups who might be at increased o ccupational risk for TB exposure (e.g. pulmonologists or respiratory therapists) or in certain settings if transmission has occurred in the past (e.g. emergency departmen ts). Policies would also require clear procedures for offering a nd documenting treatment of TB i nfection. As this proposed rule will reduce the need for TB testing, the overall effect of the rule will be to reduce costs for regulated entities. Compliance Requirements: All hospitals, hospices, CHHAs, LHC SAs and ALRs must revise pol icies for tuberculosis testing to ensure adequate base line assessments, and replace se rial testing with a nnual individual risk assessment and education, w ith further testing as indicate d and provide documentation to demonstrate compliance as part of ongoing occupational health r ecords. Professional Services: There are no additional professi onal services required as a res ult of this regulation. 12Compliance Costs: The State will develop overall guidan ce. Health care providers may have initial implementation costs related to changes in diagnostic test prod ucts, assessment procedures, risk assessment forms, and education an d databases, but this rule ch ange will result in a permanent reduction of costs once implemented. Economic and Technological Feasibility: This proposal is economically and t echnically feasible, as it d oes not require any special technology and does not impose an u nreasonable financial burden on health care institutions or local health departments. Minimizing Adverse Impact: This amendment does not create a ny adverse effect on regulated parties. Small Business and Local Government Participation: Health care provider organizations, individual institutions, lo cal health departments and the public are invited to comment during the Codes and Regulati ons Committee meeting of the Public Health and Hea lth Planning Council. Cure Period: This regulation allows a cure period of 90 days, to allow healt h care entities and local health departments to modify proc edures in order to comply. Ful l implementation is expected to 13occur over a one year period as su ccessive group s of persons ar e screened according to the revised protocols. 14RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS Effect of Rule: These regulations would requi re hospitals, hospices, CHHAs, LHC SAs and ALRs in rural areas, to revise policies f or tuberculosis testing that e nsure adequate baseline assessments, and that replace serial testing w ith annual individual risk ass essment and education, with further testing as indicated. I mpacted health care providers in rural a reas can consider using serial TB screening of certain groups who might be at increased occupatio nal risk for TB exposure (e.g. pulmonologists or respiratory therapists) or in certain setting s if transmission has occurred in the past (e.g. emergency departments) . Policies would also require clear procedures for offering and documenting treatment of TB inf ection. As this proposed rule wi ll reduce the need for TB testing, the overall effect of t he rule will be to reduce costs for regulated enti ties in rural areas. Compliance Requirements: All hospitals, hospices, CHHAs, LHC SAs and ALRs must revise pol icies for tuberculosis testing to ensure adequate base line assessments, and replace se rial testing with a nnual individual risk assessment and education, w ith further testing as indicate d and provide documentation to demonstrate compliance as part of ongoing occupational health r ecords. Professional Services: There are no additional professi onal services required as a res ult of this regulation. 15Compliance Costs: The State will develop overall guidan ce. Health care providers may have initial implementation costs related to changes in diagnostic test prod ucts, assessment procedures, risk assessment forms, and education an d databases, but this rule ch ange will result in a permanent reduction of costs once implemented. Economic and Technological Feasibility: This proposal is economically and t echnically feasible, as it d oes not require any special technology and does not impose an u nreasonable financial burden . Minimizing Adverse Impact: The Department will work with i nstitutions, occupational health groups and local health departments to provide guida nce, respond to questions and share best practices. Public and Local Government Participation: Health care organizations and f acilities, health care personnel , local health departments and the public are invited to comme nt during the Codes and Regu lations Committee meeting of the Public Health and Health Planning Council. 16JOB IMPACT STATEMENT No Job Impact Statement is requi red pursuant to section 201-a(2 )(a) of the State Administrative Procedure Act (SAPA). It is apparent, from the n ature of the proposed amendment, that it will have no impact on jobs and employment o pportunities. Pursuant to the authority veste d in the Public Health and Healt h Planning Council and the Commissioner of Health by secti on 2803 of the Public Health Law , section 709.14 of Title 10 of the Official Compila tion of Codes, Rules and Regula tions of the State of New York is hereby amended, to be eff ective after publication of No tice of Adoption in the New York State Register, to read as follows: Paragraph (3) of subdivision ( b) of section 709.1 4 is amended t o read as follows: (3) A facility proposing to initia te an adult cardiac surgery c enter must document a cardiac patient base and current c ardiac interventional referra ls sufficient to support a projected annual volume of at least [500] 300 cardiac surgery c ases and a projected annual volume of at least 36 emerg ency PCI cases within two yea rs of approval. The criteria for evaluating the nee d for additional adult cardiac s urgery centers within the planning area shall include cons ideration of appropriate access and utilization, and the ability of existing services w ithin the planning area to provid e such services. [Approval of additional adult cardiac surg ery center servi ces may be cons idered when each existing adult cardiac surgery center in the planning area is operating and expected to continue to operate at a level of at least 500 cardiac surgical procedures per year.] Waiver of this [planning area volume] require ment may be considered if: (i) the HSA region's age adju sted, population based use rate is less than the statewide average use rate; and 2 (ii) existing adult cardiac surg ery centers in the applicant fa cility's plann ing area do not have the capacity or cannot adequa tely address the need for add itional cardiac surgical procedures, such determinati ons to be based on factors includin g but not necessarily limited to analyses of recent volum e trends, analyses of Cardia c Reporting System data, and review by the area Healt h Systems Agency(s); and (iii) existing cardiac surgical referral patterns within the pl anning area indicate that approval of an additional service at the applicant facility wil l not jeopardize the minimum volume required at ot her existing cardiac surgical programs. 3 REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Statutory Authority: Public Health Law (PHL) \u00a7 2803(2) authorizes the Public Health and Health Planning Council (PHHPC) to adopt and amend rules and regulatio ns, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, to i mplement the purposes and pro visions of PHL Article 28, including the establishment of minimum standards governing the operation of health care facilities. Legislative Objectives: The legislative objectives of P HL Article 28 include the protec tion and promotion of the health of the residents of the State by requiring the ef ficient provision and proper utilization of health services, of the highest quality at a rea sonable cost. Needs and Benefits: Section 709.14 of Title 10 of the New York Codes Rules and Regu lations (10 NYCRR) provides standards to be u sed in evaluating certificate of need (CON) applications for cardiac cathe terization laboratory and cardiac surgery services in NYS hospitals. When used in conj unction with 10 NYCRR \u00a7 709.1 they represent a set of planning principles and decisi on-making tools for directing the distribution of these services, with a goal of ensuri ng appropriate access to high qu ality services while avoiding the unnecessary dup lication of resources. 4 The volume thresholds for dete rmining Public Need for additiona l adult cardiac surgery centers were last upda ted in 1994. A Regulatory Modern ization Initiative convened by the Department of Hea lth (Department) in the Fall o f 2017 with industry and stakeholder input consider ed advances in technology and med ical practice, as well as data analysis conducted by the Dep artment's Cardiac Services Pr ogram located at the University at Albany School of Public Health. The recommendatio ns resulting from the Regulatory Modernization Initiat ive form the basis for these am endments. Although there is a clear volume-out come relationship in the fi eld of cardiac surgery, the existence of high- performing progra ms with relativ ely low case volumes is well established. The data analysis conduc ted by the Cardiac S ervices Program supported retaining but lowering the volume thresholds for Card iac Surgery Center approval, effectively allowing the consideration of additional programs that would not be permissible under the 1994 thres holds. Using data from the Car diac Surgery Reporting System, which is the Department 's clinical registry for cardiac surgery, this analysis found that risk-adjusted mortalit y was statistically significan tly higher than the statewide average when program volume wa s less than 300 cases per year. T he Department determined that this volume refl ects the appropriate threshold for minimum volume requirements. The result of re ducing the volume requirements fo r Cardiac Surgery Centers in accordance with this an alysis will be increased acce ss for consumers to safe, quality cardiac surgery services in local communities as part o f regionally integrated delivery system models. 5 Costs for the Implementation of and Continuing Compliance with these Regulations to the Regulated Entity: Becoming a Cardiac Surgery Cente r is a voluntar y choice for hos pitals, not a mandate. There are approximatel y 39 hospitals that are currentl y Cardiac Surgery Centers out of 223 hospitals in New York Sta te. The cost of implementat ion and compliance with these proposed regulations is e xpected to be minim al for the af fected entities already caring for these patients. Hosp itals that choose to provide suc h services, and that have not done so previously, will need t o adhere to progra mmatic standar ds set forth in 10 NYCRR \u00a7\u00a7 405.29 and 711.4 and may incur costs to upgrade their services. Hospitals approved as Cardiac Surgery Cen ters will be required to provide data to the Cardiac Reporting System as those who a lready provide this care do alre ady. Cost to State and Local Government: Any hospital in New York State t hat is operated b y State or loc al government and that voluntarily chooses to become a cardiac surgery center wil l need to comply with these provisions. Costs for the se hospitals will be the same as for any hospital providing these services in New York State. Cost to the Department of Health: The Department will need to mon itor and provide surveillance an d oversight for the system of care provided to the se patients. The Department i s not expected to incur any additional costs, as existing staff and resources will be u tilized to conduct such surveillance and oversight. 6 Local Government Mandates: This proposed regulation does not i mpose any new programs, serv ices, duties or responsibilities on l ocal government. Paperwork: Hospitals seeking to become a Cardi ac Surgery Center will conti nue to be required to submit a Certificate of Need application to the Dep artment and, once approved, will continue to be required to report data to the De partment. Duplication: This regulation does not duplicat e any other state or federal l aw or regulation. Alternative Approaches: The Department considered a fu ll range of cardiac surgery case volumes for approval of a new program. Althoug h the Cardiac Surgery and PCI Services Health Care Regulatory Modernization Initi ative workgroup recommended the e limination of the requirement for 500 cardiac surger y cases to become a Cardiac S urgery Center, the workgroup did not recommend a n alternative nu mber. The Departm ent concluded that 300 cases was an appropriate numbe r given medical advances in c ardiac care since the requirement was last amended, a s well as recent studies on the link between cardiac surgery volumes and quality outcomes. 7 Federal Requirements: This regulatory amendment does not exceed any minimum standards of the federal government for the sam e or similar subject areas. Compliance Schedule: This proposal will go into effect upon a Notice of Adoption in the New York State Register.

Three hospitals that will be affected by this proposed regula tion are small bu sinesses (defi ned as 100 employees or less). Compliance Requirements: Becoming a Cardiac Surgery Cente r is a voluntar y choice for hos pitals, not a mandate. Hospitals, including hospi tals that are small business es, that choose to provide such services, and that have not done so previously, will need to adhere to programmatic standards set forth in in 10 NYCRR \u00a7\u00a7 405.29 and 711.4. Hospita ls approved as Cardiac Surgery Centers will be require d to provide data to the Cardiac Reporting System as those who already provide this care do already. Professional Services: This proposed regulation does not a ppreciably change the profes sional services required to provide Cardiac Surgery Center Services. 9 Compliance Costs: The cost of implementation and c ompliance with these proposed r egulations is expected to be minimal for the a ffected entities already caring for these patients. Hospitals that choose to provide Cardiac Surgery Center service s, and that have not done so previously, may incur cos ts to upgrade their services. Economic and Technological Feasibility: This proposal is economicall y and technically feasible. Minimizing Adverse Impact: This amendment does not create a ny adverse effect on regulated parties.

It is apparent, from the n ature of the proposed amendment, that it will have no impact on jobs and employment o pportunities. SUMMARY OF EXPRESS TERMS This notice of proposed rulemak ings amends 10 NYCRR Subpart 5-1 to include maximum c ontaminant levels (MC L) of 10 parts per tr illion (ppt) of Perfluorooctanesulfonic ac id (PFOS), 10 ppt for anoic acid (PFOA) and 1 part per billion (ppb) for 1,4-dioxane. Additionally, a new subdivision was added to allow wate r systems to request a defer ral from the MCL for PFOS, FPO A and 1,4-dioxane and updates to additional tables and Appendix 5-C to ensure clarity with implementation o f the MCLs. 2 Pursuant to the authority veste d in the Public Health and Healt h Planning Council and the Commissioner of Health by section 225 of the Public Health Law, Subpart 5-1 of Title 10 (Health) of the Official Co mpilation of Codes, Rules and Re gulations of the State of New Y ork is amended, to be effective upon publica tion of a Notice of Adoption in the Ne w York State Register, to read as follows: A new subdivision (p) is adde d to Section 5-1.51 to read as fol lows: (p) A system impleme nting corrective actions to comply with th e MCL for Perfluorooctanesulfoni c acid (PFOS), Perfluorooctanoi c acid (PFOA), and 1,4-dioxane listed in sect ion 5-1.52 table 3 of this subpar t may request that the State de fer actions for determining MCL violations prescribed in section 5-1.52 table 3 of thi s subpart for up to 24 months p ast the effective date of the PFOS, PFOA or 1,4-dioxane MCL. Th e system shall make such requests in writing w ithin 90 days of the effective d ate of such MCL. Requests shall document that a deferral period is necessary for a system to implement corrective actions to achieve compliance wi th the MCL for PFOS, PFOA or 1, 4-dioxane and include a timeline with specific milestones for State review a nd approval. A public notice shall be distributed within 30 days of receiving notification from t he State that a deferral has been granted. Systems opera ting with a deferral approved by the State shall comply with a ny interim monito ring, public not ification or other conditions required by the State, including but not limited to a timeline for implementation of a corrective action plan. Defe rrals granted under this subdivision may be renewed, upon r equest, for up to an addition al twelve months if the system e stablishes to the satisfaction of the State that it is taking all practical steps to mee t the corrective action plan o n which the initial d eferral was conditioned. Failure to meet any deferral conditions shall constitute a violation of t his section and may result in immediate deferral revocation. N otice of revocation of a defer ral shall will be issued in writing by the State. 3 Section 5-1.52, Table 3 is ame nded to read as follows: Table 3. Organic Chemicals Maximu m Contaminant Level Determinat ion Contaminants MCL (mg/L) Type of water system Determination of MCL violation General organic chemicals Community, NTNC and Noncommunity If the results of a monitoring sam ple analysis exceed the MCL, the supplier of water shall collect one to three more samples from the same sampling point, as soon as practical, but within 30 days. An MCL violation occurs when at l east one of the confirming sample s is positive1 and the average of the initia l sample and all confirming samples exceeds the MCL. Principal organic contaminant (POC) 0.005 Unspecified organic contaminant (UOC) 0.05 Total POCs and UOCs 0.1 Disinfection byproducts2,3 Community and NTNC For systems r equired to monitor quarterly, t he results of all analyses at each monitoring location per quarter shall be arithmetically averaged and shall be reported to the State within 30 days of t he public water system's receipt of the analyses. A violation occu rs if the average of the four most recent sets of quarterly samples a t a particular monitoring location (12-month locational running ann ual average (LRAA)) exceeds the MCL . If a system collects more than one sample per quarter at a monito ring location, the system sha ll average all samples taken in the quarter at that location to de termine a quarterly average to be used i n the LRAA calculation. If a sy stem fails to complete four consecutiv e quarters of monitoring, comp liance with the MCL will be based on an a verage of the available data from the most recent four quarters. An MCL violation for systems on annual or less frequent monitoring that have been increased to quarterly monitoring as outlined i n Table 9A, is determined aft er four quarterly samples are taken.

Systems required to conduct monitoring a t a frequency that is less than quarterly shall monitor in the calendar month identified in th e monitoring plan developed under section 5- 1.51(c). Compliance calculations shall be made beginning wit h the first compliance sample tak en after the compliance date. 3 Systems that are demonstrating compliance with the avoidance cr iteria in section 5-1.30(c), sha ll comply with the TTHM and HAA 5 LRAA MCLs; however the LRAA MCLs are not considered for avoidance purposes. For avoida nce purposes, TTHMs and HAA5s are based on a running annual ave rage of analyses from all monitoring locations. 4 Syngenta Method AG-625, \"Atrazine in Drinking Water by Immunoa ssay,\" February 2001, available from Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc., 410 Swing Road, P.O. Box 18300, Greensboro, NC 27419 . Telephone: 336-632-6000, may n ot be used for the analysis of atrazine in any system where chl orine dioxide is used for drinking water treatment. In samples from all other systems, any result for atrazine generated by Method AG-625 that is greater than on e-half the maximum contaminant level (MCL) (in other words, greater than 0.0015mg/L or 1.5 \u00b5g/L) mus t be confirmed using another approved method for this contamina nt and should use additional volume of the original sample collected for compliance monitori ng. In instances where a result from Method AG-625 triggers suc h confirmatory testing, the confirmatory result is to be used to determine compliance 5 If PCBs (as one of seven Aroclors) are detected in any sample analyzed using EPA Method 505 or 508, the system shall reanalyz e the sample usi ng EPA Method 508A to quantitate PCBs (as decachlorobiphenyl ). Compliance wit h the PCB MCL shall be determined based upon the quantitative r esults of analyses using Method 508A. 6 Section 5-1.52, Table 9C is rep ealed and replaced with a new Ta ble 9C to reads as follows: Table 9C.

Public water systems which take w ater from a surface water body or watercourse shall sample at points in the distribution system representative of each sou rce or at entry point or point s to the distribution sy stem after any water treatment plant. 2The State may decrease the quarte rly monitoring requirement to annually provided that system is reliably and consistently belo w the MCL based on a minimum of two quarterly samples from a ground water source and four quarterly samples from a surface water so urce. Systems which monitor ann ually must monitor during the quarter that previously yielded the highest analytical result. Systems servi ng fewer than 3,300 persons and which have three consecutive an nual samples without detection may apply to the State for a waiver in accordance with f ootnote 6. 3If a contaminant is detected, rep eat analysis must include all analytes contained in the approv ed analytical method for the de tected contaminant. 4Detected as used in the table sh all be defined as reported by t he State approved laboratory to be greater than or equal to the method detection limit. 5The State may allow a system to postpone monitoring for a maxim um of two years, if an approved laboratory is not reasonably av ailable to do a required analysis within the scheduled monitoring period. 6The State may waive th e monitoring requirement for a public wat er system that submits informati on every three years to demonst rate that a contaminan t or contaminants was not used, transported, stored or disposed within the watershed or zone of influence of the system. 7The State may reduce the monitoring requirement for a public wa ter system that submits information every three years to demons trate that the public water system is invulnerable to contamination. I f previous use of the contamina nt is unknown or it has been used previously, then the followin g factors shall be used to determine whether a waiver is granted. a. Previous analytical results. b. The proximity of the sy stem to a potential point or nonpoint so urce of contamination. Point sou rces include spills and leaks o f chemicals at or near a water treatment facility or at manufactu ring, distribution, or storag e facilities, or from hazardous a nd municipal waste landfills a nd other waste handling or treatment facilities. Nonpoint sour ces include the use of pesti cides to control insect and weed pests on agricultural areas, f orest lands, home and gardens, and other land application uses. c. The environmental persistence an d transport of the pesticide, P CBs, PFOA, PFOS or 1,4-dioxane. d. How well the water source is pr otected against contamination du e to such factors as depth of th e well and the type of soil and the integrity of the well casing. e. Elevated nitrate levels at the water supply source. f.

This no tice must be repeated every year until the annual report docu ments that corrective action has been com pleted in accordance with sectio n 5-1.22 of th is Subpart. 3State notification must be made by the supplier of water within 24 hours of learning of an E. coli positive sample. 4Public notification normally does not have to be issued for an E. coli positive sample prior to the resu lts of the repeat samples. How ever, there may be situations where the State determines that a Tier 1 notifi cation is necess ary to protect the public health . The supplier of water must pr ovide the Tier 1 notification no later than 24 hours after learning of th e State's determination. 5Failure to test for E. coli requires a Tier 1 notification if testing is not performed afte r any repeat sample tests po sitive for coliform. All other E. coli monitoring and testing procedure violations require Tier 3 notification. 6At a ground water system, Tier 1 notification is required after initial detection of E. coli or other fecal indicator in raw so urce water, if the system doe s not provide 4-log virus treatment and proce ss compliance monitoring. Confir mation of E. coli or other fecal indicator in the source water requires Tier 1 no tification. Failure to take confirmatory samples may b e a public health hazard requiri ng Tier 1 notification. 7Notice of the fecal indi cator positive raw water sample must be made in the annual water supply statement (see section 5-1.72( e)), until the annual report documents that corrective action has been completed. 8State notification must be made by the supplier of water within 24 hours of learning of the violation. 11 Table 13 (cont) 9Tier 2 notification is normally required; however , there may be situations where the State deter mines that a Tier 1 notificati on is necessary to protect the public health. The supplier of water mus t provide the Tier 1 notificat ion no later than 24 hours after learning of the State's determ ination. 10If the daily entry point analysi s exceeds one NTU, a repeat sam ple must be taken as soon as practicable, and preferably within one hour. If the repeat sample exceeds one NTU, the supplier of w ater must make state notifica tion. 11Systems must consult with the Sta te within 24 hours after learn ing of the violation. Based on this consultation, the State may subsequently decide to elevate the violation from a Tier 2 to a Tier 1 notifi cation. If consultati on does not take place within the 24-hour period, the water sys tem must distribute a Tier 1 notification no later than 48 hours after the sy stem learns of the violation. 12These violations include the following: failure to comply with the treatment technique or monitoring requirements in section 5 -1.30(a), (b), (c), and (g) of this Subpart; failure to comply with the avoidance criteria in secti on 5-1.30(c) of this Subpart; failure to cover a finished water storage facility or treat its discharge required in section 5-1.32 of this Subpart; failure to report t o the state information required in section 5-1.72(c)(3) of thi s Subpart; failure to maintain records required in section 5-1.72(d)(7) of this Subpart; and failure t o meet the treatment and bin classification requirements associ ated with Cryptosporidium in section 5- 1.83 of this Subpart. Failure to collect three or more samples for Cryptosporidium analysis as required in section 5-1.81 of this Subpart is a Tie r 2 violation requiring public notification. Failure to perform any other monitoring an d testing procedure as required in section 5-1.81 of this Subpa rt is a Tier 3 violation. 13Any significant deficiency that is not corrected, or where corr ection has not begun according to a State-approved corrective a ction plan within 120 days, or as directed by the State , is a TTV and must be addressed in accord ance with section 5-1.12. If the deficiency is a public health hazard, the deficiency must be addressed as directed by the State and Tier 1 notification is required. 14Applies to systems that have su rface water or groundwater direc tly influenced by surface water as a source and use chlorine. T he system must make State notification whether the residual was restored to at least 0.2 mg/L within four hours. 15Required minimum chlorine residual at point that demonstrates a dequate CT for disinfected water from ground wat er sources at f irst customer. 16Failure to take a confirmation sa mple within 24 hours for nitra te or nitrite after an initial sa mple exceeds the MCL requires a Tier 1 notification. Other monitoring violations for nitrate or nitrite require a Tier 3 notification . 17Failure to monitor for chlorine d ioxide at the entrance to the distribution system the day after exceeding the MRDL at the ent rance to the distribution system requires a Tier 2 notification. Other monitoring violations for chlorine dioxide at the entrance to the distribution system re quire a Tier 3 notification. 18If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution s ystem exceeds the MRDL for chlorine dioxide and one or more sam ples taken in the distribution system the next day exceed the M RDL, Tier 1 notification is req uired. Failure to take the required samples in the distribution system the day after the MRDL is exceeded at the entry point also triggers Tier 1 notification. 19Tier 1 notification is required if the situation meets the defi nition of a public health hazard. 12 Section 5-1.91 (d) is ame nded to read as follows: (d) The technologies listed in t his section are the best techno logy, treatment techniques, or othe r means available for achiev ing compliance with the maximum contaminant levels for or ganic chemicals listed in sect ion 5-1.52 table 3 of this Subpart: BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES (BATs) Contaminant Best Available Technologies Benzo(a)p yrene X Carbofura n X Carbon tetrachloride X 1,1-Dichloroeth X para-Dichlorobenzene X o-Dichlorobenzene X X X cis-1,2-Dichloroeth X X ylene X Dinsoeb 1,4-Dioxane X Endothal X Endri n X 13 Ethylbenzene X X Ethylene dibromide X X Glyphosate X X Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) 2,3,7,8-TCDD X ylene X Toluene 2,4,5-TP X 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene X X 1,1,1-Trichloroethane X X 1,1,2-Trichloroethane X X Trichloroeth ylene X X Advanced Oxidation Pr ocess (AOP) 4For surface water systems or ground water systems influenced by surface water, GAC10, as defi ned in section 5-1.1 of this Subp art, is the BAT for compliance with the TTHM and H AA5 MCL as a Running Annual Avera ge (RAA).

The title of subdivision (B) of s ection (II) of Appendix 5-C is amended to read as follows: B. 1,4-Dioxane 15 SUMMARY OF REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Statutory Authority: The statutory authority for the pr oposed revisions is set forth in Public Health Law (PHL) sections 201 and 225. Section 201(1)(l) of the PHL establishes the powers and duties of the New York State Department of Health (Department), which inc lude the supervision and regulation of the sanitary a spects of public water systems. Section 225 of the PHL sets forth the powers and duties of the Public Health and Healt h Planning Council (PHHPC), which include the autho rity to establish, amend and re peal sanitary regulations to be known as the State Sanitar y Code (SSC), subject to the ap proval of the Commissioner of Health. Further, section 225(5)(a) of the PHL a llows the SSC to deal with any matter affect ing the security of l ife or health, or th e preservation or improvement of public healt h, in New York State. Legislative Objective: The legislative objective of sections 201 and 225 of the PHL is to ensure that PHHPC, in conjunction with the Commissioner of Health, protect public hea lth by adopting drinking water sanitary standards. In accordance with that objective, th is regulation amends the SSC by revising Part 5 to enhance current protections governing public water systems. Furthermore, this amendment will update the SSC in accordance w ith the recommendations of the Drinking Water Quality Council, by estab lishing specific maximum contaminant levels 1,4-dioxane. 16 Needs and Benefits: In 2017, New York State (NYS) identified PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dio xane as emerging contaminants in drinking water . That same year , the Drinking Wa ter Quality Council (DWQC) was created, with direct ion to recommend MCLs for these emerging contaminants. After discussions a nd deliberations, the DWQC rec ommended MCLs to the Department for PFOA, PFO and Specifically, th e DWQC per (or 0.0010 mg/L) for 1,4-d ioxane. From 2015 through 2018, the Department coordinated targeted sam pling of 278 public water systems for PFOA and PFOS. The 278 public water systems w ere mainly medium (serving 3,300 to 10,000 persons) to sma ll (serving less than 3 ,300 persons) community water systems and non-transient no ncommunity systems typically with a groundwater source located near a potential so urce of PFOA and/or PFOS. The results of this testing are shown in Figures 1A and 1B. 17 Figure 1A. Figure 1B. From 2013 through 2015 public water systems across NYS, under t he United States Environmental Protection Agency ( US EPA) Unregulated Contaminan t Monitoring Rule 151 93 27 7 Non-detect (< 0.000002 )0.000002 to 0.000010> 0.000010 Public Water Systems PFOA Levels (mg/L)Number of NYS Public Water Systems Sampled and Distribution of PFOA Levels 178 76 168 Non-detect (< 0.000002 )0.000002 to 0.000010 Public Water Systems PFOS Levels (mg/L)Number of NYS Public Water Systems Sampled and Distribution of PFOS Levels18 3 (UCMR 3), tested for 1,4-dioxane. All large public water syst ems (serving 10,000 persons or more) and 32 randomly s elected medium and small wate r systems (serving less than 10,000 persons) in NYS conducted testing. Figure 2 sh ows that 11 percent (%) of the water systems tested ha d 1,4-dioxane levels above the DW QC's recommended MCL of 0.0010 mg/L. Figure 2. Based on the UCMR3 data, 51% of the samples from Long Island pu blic water systems had levels of 1,4-dioxane above the reporting level of 0.00007 mg/L compared to 6% for NYS excluding Long Island. The Department provided the D WQC with technical information on a range of health- based drinking water values for PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dioxane afte r an evaluation of the available health effects inform ation on the che micals from toxi cological studies. These values included current nationa l and state guidelines and advis ory levels, as well as 119 1812 9 10 Non-detect (< 0.00007 Public Water Systems 1,4-dioxane Levels (mg/L)Number of NYS Public Water Systems Sampled under UCMR 3 and Distribution of 1,4-dioxane Levels19 potential health based values de veloped by the Department. Base d on their review of this information, the DWQC reco mmended an MCL of 0.0000100 mg/L for PFOA and PFOS as individual compounds, which is within the range of the poten tial health based water values presented to the DW QC by the Department (0.000006 to mg/L h is within the range of cu rrent national and state guidelines and advisory levels presented by the Department (0.0 0035 to 0.2 mg/L). In the absence of federal regul ations governing PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dioxane in drinking water, and after consideration of the recommendations provided by the DWQC, the Department is proposing to ame nd 10 NYCRR Part 5 to establish M CLs for these contaminants. The Department is proposing an MCL of 0.0000100 m g/L for mg/L for 1,4-dioxan e. These MCLs will apply to all public water supplies regulated by the Department and provide a sufficient margin of protection aga inst adverse health effects in the most sensitive populations, including fetuses during pregna ncy, breastfed infants, and infa nts bottle fed with formula reconstituted using tap water. In addition, the MCLs provide a sufficient margin of protection for lifetime exposur e through drinking water for the general population. Compliance Costs Cost to Private Regulated Parties: There are approximately 7,200 pr ivately owned public water syst ems in NYS. Of these, an estimated 2,100 systems serve r esidential suburban areas, ma nufactured housing communities and apartment buildings, residential and non-reside ntial health care 20 facilities, industrial and comme rcial buildings, private school s and colleges, and other facilities. The remaining 5,100 pr ivately owned public water sy stems serve restaurants, convenient stores, motels, camps ites and other transient system s. Costs will include initial monitoring, continued routine monitoring a nd treatment in the e vent of a MCL exceedance for PFOS, PFOA and/or 1,4-dioxane. Monitoring and treatment costs f or privately-owned public water systems is dependent upon the system size, the number of affected entry points/sourc es and the concentration of each contaminant. The exact costs for mon itoring and treatme nt of PFOS, PFOA and 1,4-dioxane for public water syste ms, including privately-owned public water systems, cannot be determined due to several variables. The cost for a s ingle PFOA/PFOS analysis is between $200-$300 per sample. The cost of a single 1,4-dioxa ne analysis is between $100-$250. It is estimated that approximate ly 21% of all public water syst ems, including privately- owned public water systems, will ha ve levels of PFOA or PFOS ab ove the proposed MCLs of 0.0000100 mg/L. For small s ystems serving less than 3,3 00 persons, capital and annual maintenance costs are es timated to be approximately $400 ,000 and $25,000, respectively. For medium syst ems (serving 3,300 or more persons but less than 10,000 persons), capital and annual main tenance costs ar e estimated to be approximately $2,400,000 and $125,000, respectively. For large systems (servi ng 10,000 persons or more), capital and annual maintena nce costs are estimated to be approximately $15,000,000 and $725,000, respectively. 21 It is estimated that eight y-nine (89) public water facilities, (a single public water system may be comprised of multiple public water facilities), will hav e a detection of 1,4- dioxane above the proposed MCL of 0.0010 mg/L. The average cost of treatment for 1,4- dioxane is estimated to be $3,570,000 per system, with an estim ated average annual operation and maintenance cost of approximately $150,000 per sy stem. Public water systems will likel y make rate adjustments to accom modate these additional capital and operational costs. Cost to State Government: State agencies that operate public water systems will be requir ed to comply with the proposed amendments. There are approximately 250 State-owned or operated facilities with a public water system. Examp les of such facilities are Sta te-owned schools, buildings, correctional faciliti es, Thruway services areas, and any other State-owned structure or property that ser ves an average of at least 25 ind ividuals daily at least 60 days out of the year. Costs will include initial monitoring for PFOA, PFOS and/or 1,4 -dioxane, continued routine monitoring, and treatment i n the event of a MCL exceeda nce. These potential costs will be the same as the c osts to private regulated partie s. The proposed regulation will als o impose administrative costs t o the Department relating to implementation and oversight of the drinking water monitorin g requirements including 22 review and approval of sampling s chedules; review and reporting of sample results; providing technical assistance t o the public wat er suppliers; r eview and approval of plans (i.e., treatment plans) ; and activities asso ciated with enforce ment and public notification of MCL exceedances. Additionally, the Department and N YS Department of Environmenta l Conservation (NYSDEC) will incur costs associated with the investigation, re mediation, and long-term monitoring associated with the r elease of these c ontaminants. Although the proposed regulations do not apply to private wells , costs will be incurred by NYSDEC, as the lead agency for i nvestigating, re mediating, and monitoring of contaminated sites, as the MC Ls will be used by the NYSDEC as g uidance to determine whether a private well in NYS is contaminated by PFOA, PFOS and /or 1,4-dioxane. There are an estimated 800,000 priv ate water supply wells in NY S. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the number of private wells that might be affected by contamination and, therefore, associated costs to NYSDEC cannot be determined . Cost to Local Government: The regulations will apply to local governments\u2014including towns , villages, counties, cities, and authorities or area wi de improvement districts\u2014whic h own or operate a public water system subject to this re gulation. There are approximatel y 1,500 public water systems that are owned or ope rated by local gov ernments. 23 Costs will include initial monitoring for PFOA, PFOS and/or 1,4 -dioxane, continued routine monitoring, and treatment i n the event of a MCL exceeda nce. These potential costs will be the same as the c osts to private regulated partie s. Local health departments that re gulate drinking water will also incur administrative costs related to local imple mentation and oversig ht of the drinking w ater monitoring requirements including review a nd approval of sampling schedule s; review and reporting of sample results; providing t echnical assistance to the public water suppliers; review and approval of plans (i.e., treat ment plans); review and approval of MCL deferrals; and activities associated with enf orcement and public notification. Local Government Mandates: Local governments will be require d to comply with this regulati on as noted above. Paperwork: The additional monitoring, re porting, recordkeeping and paperwo rk needed for PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dioxane is expected to be minimal because operator s of public water supplies are currently required to keep suc h records for existi ng MCLs, and these regulations only add three additi onal chemicals. The reporting and recordkeeping requirements will increase if MCLs are exceeded and/or treatmen t is required. Duplication: There will be no duplication of exi sting State or federal regul ations. 24 Alternatives: One alternative is to maintai n the existing MCL of 0.05 mg/L th at applies to all unspecified organic chemicals wh en no chemical-specific MCL exi sts. Another alternative is to wait for the US EPA to issue a federal MCL. B ased on DWQC deliberations and the additional analysis done by the Departmen t it was determined that the current MCL of 0.05 mg/L, whic h is a generic standard for a broad class of organic chemicals is not protective of publ ic health for these three sp ecific chemicals. Waiting for the US EPA to set a new MCL was impractical due t o the prevalen ce and concerns surrounding PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dioxa ne. Therefore, the Departm ent determined of for PFOA, PFOS and 1,4 -dioxane is in the best interest of protecting the public health of NYS reside nts. Federal Standards: There is no federal MCL for PFOA, PFOS or 1,4-dioxane. Compliance Schedule: The MCLs will be immediately e ffective upon publication of a No tice of Adoption in the New York State Register. Pub lic water systems serving 10,000 pe rsons or more must begin monitoring within 60 days of adoption. Water systems serv ing 3,300 to 9,999 people must begin monitori ng within 90 days of adoption and wat er systems serving less than 3,300 must begin monitoring within 6 months of adoption. 25 Based on public comments received, the Department has included a provision for a public water system to defer an MCL vi olation. A public water system c an request, from the State, a deferral within 90 days of the effective date of the M CL if the public water system has sample results that e xceed the MCL for PFOA, PFOS or 1,4-dioxane, and they have a plan in place to achie ve compliance with the MCL; t he deferral may be issued for up to two years with t he potential for a one-year ex tension based on a demonstrated need.

In accordance with that objective, th is regulation amends the SSC by revising Part 5 to enhance current protections governing public water systems. Furthermore, this amendment will update the SSC in accordance w ith the recommendations of the Drinking Water Quality Council by establishing specific maximum contaminant levels (MCLs ) for perfluorooctanoic acid (P 1,4-dioxane. 27 Needs and Benefits: In 2017, New York State (NYS) identified PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dio xane as emerging contaminants in drinking water . That same year , the Drinking Wa ter Quality Council (DWQC) was created, with direct ion to recommend MCLs for these emerging contaminants. After discussions a nd deliberations, the DWQC rec ommended MCLs to the Department for PFOA, PFO and Specifically, th e DWQC per ne are anthropogenic chemicals that hav e been manufactured or used throughout the United Sta tes. PFOA and PFOS have been u sed for their emulsifier and surfactant propert ies in fire-fighting foam, pol ishes, and cleaners. PFOA has also been used in fluoropolym ers (e.g. Teflon), cosmetics, lubricants, paints, coatings, laminates, adhesives and photograp hic films. 1,4-dioxane has be en used as a stabilizer for chlorinated solvents, as a labor atory reagent and as a solvent in the manufacture of other chemicals. 1,4-dioxane is also f ound in paint strippers, antifr eeze, dyes, greases, detergents, cosmetics an d other products. PFOA and PFOS are no longer manuf actured in the United States, but there may be some limited ongoing uses of these che micals. The use of 1,4-dioxane as a solvent and solvent stabilizer has decreased because of the phase out of many chlor inated solvents, but it is 28 still used as a chemical inter mediate and laboratory solvent, a nd can be found in some consumer products. From 2015 through 2018, the Department coordinated targeted sam pling of 278 public water systems for PFOA and PFOS. The 278 public water systems w ere mainly medium (serving 3,300 to 10,000 persons) to sma ll (serving less than 3 ,300 persons) community water systems and non-transient no ncommunity systems typically with a groundwater source located near a potential so urce of PFOA and/or PFOS.

The toxicity of PFOA has been e xtensively reviewed, evaluated a nd summarized by several authoritative bodies, including the US EPA, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), Healt h Canada, and the states of New Jersey and Minnesota. These evaluations indicate associ ations between increased PFOA exposure in humans and an increased risk for sev eral types of health effects. These include effects on the liver, kidney, immune system, thyroid gla nd, cholesterol levels, uric acid levels, pre-eclampsia (a complication of pregnancy tha t includes high blood pressure) , ulcerative colitis, development effects, and kidney a nd testicular cancer. Exposure to PFOA has also been shown to cause several adverse he alth effects in laboratory ani mals. PFOA caused cancer of the liver, pancreas, and testi s in rats exposed for their li fetimes. Noncancer health effects caused by PFOA exposure in animals include liver toxici ty, kidney toxicity, 119 1812 9 10 Non-detect (< Public Water Systems 1,4-dioxane Levels (mg/L)Number of NYS Public Water Systems Sampled under UCMR 3 and Distribution of 1,4-dioxane Levels31 developmental toxicity and immune system toxicity. The US EPA considers PFOA to have suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential. The toxicity of PFOS has also b een extensively reviewed, evalua ted and summarized by several authoritative bodies, including the US EPA, ATSDR, Heal th Canada, European Food Safety Authority, the Organi zation for Economic Co-operati on and Development and the states of New Jersey and M innesota. These evaluations i ndicate associations between increased PFOS exposure in humans and an increased risk for several health effects, including increases in t otal serum chole sterol, trigly cerides, and uric acid, altered immune response, and effects on reproduction and development. P FOS exposure has also been shown to cause several adverse health effects in laborator y animals including liver and thyroid cancer in rats expose d for their lifetimes. Noncanc er effects caused by PFOS in animals include effects on the liver, immune system, cholest erol levels, and the developing nervous system, and r educed survival in offspring bo rn to rats. The US EPA considers PFOS to have suggestiv e evidence of carcinogenic pote ntial. The toxicity of 1,4-dioxane has b een extensively reviewed, eval uated and summarized by the US EPA and ATSDR. 1,4-dioxane causes liver cancer in severa l species of laboratory animals (rats, mice and guinea pi gs) exposed to high levels for their lifetimes. Other cancers caused by 1,4-dioxane in labor atory animals include bre ast cancer and cancer of the peritoneum and nasal cavity. L aboratory animals exposed to large amounts of 1,4- dioxane in drinking wat er for long periods of time also had non cancer health effects on the liver, kidney, nasal cavity a nd respiratory system. Based o n sufficient evidence for 32 carcinogenicity in animals, the U SEPA classifies 1,4-dioxane as likely to be carcinogenic to humans by all routes of expos ure, and the United States Depa rtment of Health and Human Services includes 1,4-dioxane in its list of chemicals th at are reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens. The Department provided the D WQC with technical information on a range of health- based drinking water values for PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dioxane afte r an evaluation of the available health effects inform ation on the che micals from toxi cological studies. These values included current nationa l and state guidelines and advis ory levels, as well as potential health based values de veloped by the Department. Base d on their review of this information, the DWQC reco mmended an MCL of 0.0000100 mg/L for PFOA and PFOS as individual compounds, which is within the range of the poten tial health based water values presented to the DW QC by the Department (0.000006 to mg/L h is within the range of cu rrent national and state guidelines and advisory levels presented by the Department (0.0 0035 to 0.2 mg/L). In the absence of federal regul ations governing PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dioxane in drinking water, and after consideration of the recommendations provided by the DWQC, the Department is amending 10 NYCRR Part 5 to establish MCLs for th ese contaminants. The Department is proposi ng MCL of 0.0000100 mg/L 0.0010 m g/L for 1,4-dioxane. These MCLs will apply to all public water supplies regulated by the Department and provide a sufficient margin of 33 protection against adverse healt h effects in the most sensitive populations, including fetuses during pregnancy, breastfed infants, and infants bottle fed with formula reconstituted using tap water. In addition, the MCLs provide a sufficient margin of protection for lifetime exposur e through drinking water for the general population. These regulations will am end 10 NYCRR 5-1.52, Table 3, to list PFOA, PFOS and 1,4- dioxane and their proposed MCLs . In addition, these regulations will amend 10 NYCRR 5-1.52, Table 9C, to include these t hree contaminants in the cu rrent minimum monitoring requirements for additional orga nic chemicals. Table 9C was als o amended to remove references to \"Group 1\" and \"Gr oup 2\" chemicals as these groupi ngs are outdated and no longer relevant. The MCLs appl y to finished wat er. Initial mo nitoring for community and non-transient noncommuni ty public water systems will be quarterly for one year depending on system size. Monitori ng at transient noncommunity public water systems will be at the Department's di scretion. Previous testing conduc ted using an Environmental Laboratory Appr oval Program (ELAP) approved metho d and laboratory may satisfy some or all of the i nitial monitoring requirements at the Department's discretion, or the local health department's discretion in cons ultation with the Department. Specifically, sample results for PFOA and PFOS anal yzed after June 1, 2016 may be used to satisfy the initia l monitoring requirements for 2019-20. Sample results for 1,4-dioxane analyzed after J une 14, 2017 may be used to satisfy the initial monitoring requirements for 2019-20. 34 Compliance Costs Cost to Private Regulated Parties: There are approximately 7,200 pr ivately owned public water syst ems in NYS. Of these, an estimated 2,100 systems serve r esidential suburban areas, ma nufactured housing communities and apartment buildings, residential and non-reside ntial health care facilities, industrial and comme rcial buildings, private school s and colleges, and other facilities. The remaining 5,100 pr ivately owned public water sy stems serve restaurants, convenient stores, motels, camps ites and other transient system s. Costs will include initial monitoring, continued routine monitoring a nd treatment in the e vent of a MCL exceedance for PFOS, PFOA and/or 1,4-dioxane. Monitoring and treatment costs f or privately-owned public water systems is dependent upon the system size, the number of affected entry points/sourc es and the concentration of each contaminant. The exact costs for mon itoring and treatme nt of PFOS, PFOA and 1,4-dioxane for public water syste ms, including privately-owned public water systems, cannot be determined due to several variables. The cost for a s ingle PFOA/PFOS analysis is between $200-$300 per sample. The cost of a single 1,4-dioxa ne analysis is between $100-$250. It is estimated that approximate ly 21% of all public water syst ems, including privately- owned public water systems, will ha ve levels of PFOA or PFOS ab ove the MCLs of 0.0000100 mg/L. For small systems serving less than 3,300 perso ns, capital and annual maintenance costs are est imated to be approximately $400,000 an d $25,000, respectively. 35 For medium systems (serving 3,300 or more persons but less than 10,000 persons), capital and annual maintenance co sts are estimated to be approx imately $2,400,000 and $125,000, respectively. For large systems (serving 10,000 perso ns or more), capital and annual maintenance costs are es timated to be approximately $15, 000,000 and $725,000, respectively. It is estimated that eighty- nine (89) public water facilities, (a single public water system may be comprised of multiple public water facilities), will hav e a detection of 1,4- dioxane above the MCL of 0.0010 mg/ L. The average cost of treat ment for 1,4-dioxane is estimated to be $3,570,000 per system , with an estimated averag e annual operation and maintenance cost of appr oximately $150,000 per system. Public water systems will likel y make rate adjustments to accom modate these additional capital and operational costs. Cost to State Government: State agencies that operate public water systems will be requir ed to comply with the proposed amendments. There are approximately 250 State-owned or operated facilities with a public water system. Examp les of such facilities are Sta te-owned schools, buildings, correctional faciliti es, Thruway services areas, and any other State-owned structure or property that ser ves an average of at least 25 ind ividuals daily at least 60 days out of the year. 36 Costs will include initial monitoring for PFOA, PFOS and/or 1,4 -dioxane, continued routine monitoring, and treatment i n the event of a MCL exceeda nce. These potential costs will be the same as the c osts to private regulated partie s. The proposed regulation will als o create administrative costs t o the Department relating to implementation and oversight of the drinking water monitorin g requirements including review and approval of sampling s chedules; review and reporting of sample results; providing technical assistance t o the public wat er suppliers; r eview and approval of plans (i.e., treatment plans) ; and activities asso ciated with enforce ment and public notification. Additionally, the Department and N YS Department of Environmenta l Conservation (NYSDEC) will incur costs associated with the investigation, re mediation, and long-term monitoring associated with the r elease of these c ontaminants. Although the proposed regulations do not apply to private wells , costs will be incurred by NYSDEC, as the lead agency for i nvestigating, re mediating, and monitoring of contaminated sites, as the MC Ls will be used by the NYSDEC as g uidance to determine whether a private well in NYS is contaminated by PFOA, PFOS and /or 1,4-dioxane. There are an estimated 800,000 priv ate water supply wells in NY S. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the number of private wells that might be affected by contamination and therefore costs to NYS DEC cannot be determined. 37 Cost to Local Government: The regulations will apply to local governments\u2014including towns , villages, counties, cities, and authorities or area wi de improvement districts\u2014whic h own or operate a public water system subject to this re gulation. There are approximatel y 1,500 public water systems that are owned or ope rated by local gov ernments. Costs will include initial monitoring for PFOA, PFOS and/or 1,4 -dioxane, continued routine monitoring, and treatment i n the event of a MCL exceeda nce. These potential costs will be the same as the c osts to private regulated partie s. Local health departments that re gulate drinking water will also incur administrative costs related to local imple mentation and oversig ht of the drinking w ater monitoring requirements including review a nd approval of sampling schedule s; review and reporting of sample results; providing t echnical assistance to the public water suppliers; review and approval of plans (i.e., treatme nt plans); and activities assoc iated with enforcement and public notification of MCL exceedances and deferrals. Local Government Mandates: Local governments will be require d to comply with this regulati on as noted above. Paperwork: The additional monitoring, re porting, recordkeeping and paperwo rk needed for PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dioxane is expected to be minimal because operator s of public water 38 supplies are currently required to keep suc h records for existi ng MCLs, and these regulations only add three additi onal chemicals. The reporting and recordkeeping requirements will increase if MCLs are exceeded and/or treatmen t is required. Duplication: There will be no duplication of exi sting State or federal regul ations. Alternatives: One alternative is to maintai n the existing MCL of 0.05 mg/L th at applies to all unspecified organic chemicals wh en no chemical-specific MCL exi sts. Another alternative is to wait for the US EPA to issue a federal MCL. B ased on DWQC deliberations and the additional analysis done by the Departmen t it was determined that the current MCL of 0.05 mg/L, whic h is a generic standard for a broad class of organic chemicals is not protective of publ ic health for these three sp ecific chemicals. Waiting for the US EPA to set a new MCL was impractical due t o the prevalen ce and concerns surrounding PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dioxa ne. Therefore, the Departm ent determined of for PFOA, PFOS and 1,4 -dioxane is in the best interest of protecting the public health of NYS reside nts. Federal Standards: There is no federal MCL for PFOA, PFOS or 1,4-dioxane. 39 Compliance Schedule: The MCLs will be immediately e ffective upon publication of a No tice of Adoption in the New York State Register. Pub lic water systems serving 10,000 pe rsons or more must begin monitoring within 60 days of adoption. Water systems serv ing 3,300 to 9,999 people must begin monitori ng within 90 days of adoption and wat er systems serving less than 3,300 must begin monitoring within 6 months of adoption. Based on public comments received, the Department has included a provision for a public water system to defer an MCL vi olation. A public water system c an request, from the State, a deferral within 90 days of the effective date of the M CL if the public water system has sample results that e xceed the MCL for PFOA, PFOS or 1,4-dioxane, and they have a plan in place to achie ve compliance with the MCL; t he deferral may be issued for up to two years with t he potential for a one-year ex tension based on a demonstrated need.

The Department does not maintain information on the exact number of the public water systems own ed by small businesses. There are approximately 1500 wat er systems owned by local gover nments. Reporting and Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements: The obligations on small businesse s and local governments are t he same as for all owners or operators of public water syste ms. The regulations require a dditional monitoring, reporting, recordkeeping and public notification requirements f or three additional contaminants, PFOA, PFOS and 1,4- dioxane. These requirements wi ll increase if MCLs are exceeded and/or tre atment is required. Local health departments that re gulate drinking water will also incur administrative costs related to local imple mentation and oversig ht of the drinking w ater monitoring requirements including review a nd approval of sampling schedule s; review and reporting of sample results; providing t echnical assistance to the public water suppliers; review and approval of plans (i.e., treatme nt plans); and activities assoc iated with enforcement and public notification of MCL exceedances and deferrals. 41 Professional Services: Public water systems impacted by the amended regulations will r equire the services of a laboratory to analyze samples for PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dioxane. T he laboratory must be approved by the Department under it s Environmental Laboratory A pproval Program (ELAP). Sufficient laboratory capability and capacity is antici pated to be available to process the initial staggered t esting demands and future testin g. If an MCL is exceeded, a licensed professional will be req uired to design changes to the public water system to meet the MCL. Compliance Costs: Cost to Private Regulated Parties and Local Governments: A small business or local government will incur the same costs as other regulated parties. Costs will include initial monitoring, continued routine monito ring, and treatment in the event of a MCL exceedance for PFOS, PFOA and 1,4-dioxane. Monitoring and treatment costs f or small businesses and local g overnment owned public water systems is dependent upon t he system size, the number of affected entry points/sources and the concentration of each contaminant. The exact costs for monitoring and treatment of PFOS, PFOA a nd 1,4-dioxane for public water sy stems, including privately-owned public water sys tems, cannot be determined due to several variables. The cost for a single PFOA/ PFOS analysis is between $200-$300 p er sample. The cost of a single 1,4-dioxane analysis is between $100-$250. For small s ystems serving less than 3,300 persons, capital and annual maintenance costs are estimat ed to be approximately $400,000 and $25,000, respectively. For medium systems (serving 3,300 or more persons 42 but less than 10,000 persons), capit al and annual maintenance c osts are estimated to be approximately $2,400,000 and $125,000, respectively. For large systems (serving 10,000 persons or more), capital and annua l maintenance costs are esti mated to be approximately $15,000,000 and $725,000, respectively. It is estimated that eighty- nine (89) public water facilities, (a single public water system may be comprised of multiple public water facilities), will det ect 1,4-dioxane above the MCL of 0.0010 mg/L. The average cos t of treatment for 1,4-dioxa ne is estimated to be $3,570,000 per system, with an estimat ed average annual operati on and maintenance cost of approximately $150,000 per system. Public water systems will likel y make rate adjustments to accom modate these additional capital and operational costs. Local health departments that re gulate drinking water will also incur administrative costs related to local imple mentation and oversig ht of the drinking w ater monitoring requirements including review a nd approval of sampling schedule s; review and reporting of sample results; providing t echnical assistance to the public water suppliers; review and approval of plans (i.e., treat ment plans), and activities assoc iated with enforcement, including public notification of MCL exceedances and deferrals. 43 Economic and Technological Feasibility: These regulations are economica lly and technologically feasible for small businesses and local governments. Analytical methods exist for accurate sample analysis to detect PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dioxane. There are also technologically feas ible treatment solutions for all three contaminants. Treat ment may present a greater cha llenge to smaller systems that typically have less resour ces including financial and tech nical expertise than larger systems. Minimizing Adverse Impact: The Department has included sev eral provisions that minimize th e impacts on regulated parties. Previous testing conduc ted using an ELAP approved meth od and laboratory may satisfy some or all of the initi al monitoring requirements at t he Department's discretion, or the local health department 's discretion in consultation wit h the Department; sampling frequency will decrease after the first year if a contaminant ( or the contaminants) is/are not detected at a public water sys tem; the start of initial sam pling is proposed to be staggered, requiring large syst ems to test first (within 60 day s of adoption) and providing more time for smaller systems such that water systems serving b etween 3,300 to 10,000 persons should sample withi n 90 days of adoption and water syst ems serving less than 3,300 persons must begin sampling within 6 months of adoption. In addition, New York State offe rs programs to support public w ater systems with infrastructure investments incl uding but not limited to treatme nt and development/connection to alterna te sources of water. Programs include the Drinking 44 Water State Revolving Fund which pr ovides market rate, low to n o interest loans and grants available to many muni cipally and privately-owned public water systems based on need and financial hardship. In a ddition, the New York State Cl ean Water Infrastructure Act of 2017 invests $2.5 billion i n clean and drinking water in frastructure projects and water quality protecti on across the State . It provides funding to the New York State Water Infrastructure Improveme nt Act of 2017 (WIIA) for grants to assist municipalities with water quality infrastruct ure. A separate $200 million has been provided to support grants for drinking water projects that will address emerging c ontaminants such as PFOA, PFOS or 1,4-dioxane. Small Business and Local Government Participation: Small business and local governme nts were not specifically cons ulted on this proposal, however the MCLs set forth in th is proposed rule were recommend ations from the Drinking Water Quality Council (DWQ C) which met numerous times in a public forum and were also recorded. The reco rdings are publicly available o n the Department's web- site. During each DWQC meeting, members of the public were all owed to comment, and comments were provided to the Dep artment outside of the meeting s. Based on the information available it is not possible to determine the numbe r of small businesses that participated during the meetin gs or provided comments, but from sign in sheets at the meetings some businesses did part icipate in the meetings. All c omments provided by the public were made available to the DWQC for their consideration. 45 RURAL AREA FLEXABILITY ANALYSIS Types and Estimated Numbers of Rural Areas: These regulations apply to rural areas of the state, where appr oximately 6,400 small public water systems are locate d, in the same manner as the res t of the state. Reporting, Record keeping and Other Compliance Requirements Reporting and Recordkeeping: The obligations imposed on rural a rea public water systems are the same as for all owners or operators of public water syste ms. The regulations require a dditional monitoring, reporting, recordkeeping and public notification requirements f or three additional contaminants, PFOA, PFOS and 1,4- dioxane. These requirements wi ll increase if MCLs are exceeded and/or tre atment is required. Professional Services: Like all public water systems, rur al area public water systems impacted by the amended regulations will require the services of a laboratory to analyz e samples for PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dioxane. The laborator y must be approved by the Departm ent under its Environmental Laboratory Approva l Program (ELAP). Sufficient la boratory capability and capacity is anticipated to be available to process the init ial staggered testing demands and future testing. If an MCL is exceeded, a licensed professio nal will be required to design changes to the public wat er system to meet the MCL. 46 Compliance Costs: Rural area public water systems w ill incur the same costs as ot her regulated parties. Costs will include initial monitoring, continued routine monitoring, and treatment in the event of a MCL exceedance for PFOS, PFOA and 7,200 privately-owned water systems . Of these, an estimated 2,100 sys tems serve residential suburban areas, manufactured housi ng communities and apartment buildings, residential and non-residential health care facilities, industrial and comm ercial buildings, private schools and colleges, and other facilities. The remaining 5,100 privately-owned systems, such as those at restaurants, m otels and campsites, serve trans ient populations. Monitoring and treatment costs for rural area public water syst ems is dependent upon the system size, the number of aff ected entry points/sources and th e concentration of each contaminant. The exact costs for monitoring and treatment of P FOS, PFOA and 1,4- dioxane for public water syste ms, including rural area public w ater systems, cannot be determined due to several variab les. The cost for a single PFOA /PFOS analysis is between $200-$300 per sample. The c ost of a single 1,4-dioxane analysis is between $100-$250. For small systems ser ving less than 3,300 persons, c apital and annual maintenance costs are est imated to be approximately $400,000 an d $25,000, respectively. For medium systems (serving 3,300 or more persons but less than 10,000 persons), capital and annual maintenance co sts are estimated to be approx imately $2,400,000 and $125,000, respectively. For large systems (serving 10,000 perso ns or more), capital and annual maintenance costs are es timated to be approximately $15, 000,000 and $725,000, respectively. 47 It is estimated that eighty- nine (89) public water facilities, (a single public water system may be comprised of multiple public water facilities), will hav e a detection of 1,4- dioxane above the MCL of 0.0010 mg/ L. The average cost of treat ment for 1,4-dioxane is estimated to be $3,570,000 per system , with an estimated averag e annual operation and maintenance cost of appr oximately $150,000 per system. Economic and Technological Feasibility: These regulations are economica lly and technologically feasible for rural area public water systems. Analytical methods exist for accur ate sample ana lysis to detect PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-dioxane. There are a lso technologically feasible t reatment solutions for all three contaminants. Treatment may present a greater challenge t o smaller systems that typically have less resources i ncluding financial and technical expertise than larger systems. Minimizing Adverse Econom ic Impact on Rural Areas: The Department has included sev eral provisions that minimize th e impacts on regulated parties. Previous testing conduc ted using an ELAP approved meth od and laboratory may satisfy some or all of the initi al monitoring requirements at t he Department's discretion, or the local health department 's discretion in consultation wit h the Department; sampling frequency will decrease after the first year if a contaminant ( or the contaminants) is/are not detected at a public water sys tem; the start of initial sam pling is proposed to be staggered, requiring large syst ems to test first (within 60 day s of adoption) and providing more time for smaller systems such that water systems serving b etween 3,300 to 10,000 48 persons should sample withi n 90 days of adoption and water syst ems serving less than 3,300 persons must begin sampling within 6 months of adoption. In addition, New York State offe rs programs to support public w ater systems with infrastructure investments incl uding but not limited to treatme nt and development/connection to alterna te sources of water.

A separate $200 million has been provided to support grants for drinking water projects that will address emerging c ontaminants such as PFOA, PFOS or 1,4-dioxane. Rural Area Participation: Rural area stakeholders were not specifically consulted on this proposal, however the MCLs set forth in this propose d rule were recommendations from the Drinking Water Quality Council (DWQC) which m et numerous times in a public for um and were also recorded. The membership of the D WQC included members from rura l areas . The recordings are publicly availabl e on the Department's web-site. During each DWQC meeting, members of the public cou ld comment, and comments were provided to the 49 Department outside of the me etings. Based on t he information a vailable it is not possible to determine the exact number of rural stakeholders that partic ipated during the meetings or provided comments, but from si gn in sheets at the meetings r ural communities attended DWQC meetings. All co mments provided by the public we re made available to the DWQC for their consideration. 50 JOB IMPACT STATEMENT Nature of the Impact: The Department expects there to be a positive impact on jobs or employment opportunities. A subset of public w ater system owners will like ly hire firms or individuals to assist with regulatory compli ance. Public water systems impa cted by this amendment will require the professional se rvices of a certified or approv ed laboratory to perform the analyses for PFOA, PFOS and 1,4-di oxane, which may create a nee d for additional laboratory capability and capaci ty. Additionally , a subset of o wners will require the services of a licensed professi onal engineer to design faciliti es to meet the MCLs through treatment, or to access an alternate source. Categories and Numbers Affected: The Department anticipates no ne gative impact on j obs or employ ment opportunities as a result of the propos ed regulations. Regions of Adverse Impact: The Department anticipates no ne gative impact on j obs or employ ment opportunities in any particular region of the state. Minimizing Adverse Impact: Not applicable. Project #192324-C Exhibit Page 1 Public Health and Health Planning Council Project # 192324-C Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center Program: Hospital Count y: Suffolk Purpose: Construction Acknowled ged: Januar y 2, 2020 Executive Summary Description Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center (GSH), a 437-bed, voluntary not-f or-profit, Article 28 acute care hospital located at 1000 Montauk Highway, West Islip (Suffo lk County), requests approval to construct a six-story addition to the hospital to include a new emergency department (ED), a new, larger operating room (OR) suite, 36 additional private rooms with no change to the certified bed capaci ty, and shell space for future expansion. GSH is co-operated by Catholic Health System of Long Island, Inc. (CHSLI). The approxim ately 300,000-square- foot addition will be known as the Patient Care Pavilion (PCP) and will pr ovide significant and needed improvements and enhancements to the inpatient, surgical and emergency services of GSH. The PCP will be connected to the hospital and will include the following: First Floor: a 75-room ED and a central sterile supply and processing department; Second Floor: a new 16-OR surgical suite and platform including perioperative and support space; floor; for future private-room inpatient floors; Although GSH has made facility and programmatic improvements over the last several years, their last major expansion project was over 33 years ago, and they have been maneuvering within an antiquated operational infrastructure and facilit y setting. This project is essential for the hospital to meet the current and future health care needs of the community GSH serves. GSH is not seeking an increase in the number of certified beds in this project; it is, however, seeking to increase the number of private inpatient beds, a s well as increase the number of ED rooms and ORs to meet current and future demand. OPCHSM Recommendation Contingent Approval Need Summary The proposed Patient Care Pavilion, the first major expansion project at Good Samaritan Hospital in over 33 years, addresses the facility's immediate need s while also providing prudent capacity and flex ibility for the future. Program Summary Based on the results of th is review, a favorable recommendation can be made regarding the facility's current comp liance pursuant to 2802- (3)(e) of the New York S tate Public Health Law.

[DAS] Council Action Date July 30, 2020 Project #192324-C Exhibit Page 4 Need and Program Analysis Project Description Good Samaritan Hospital Medica l Center (GSH), a, 437-bed, not-f or-profit hospital and member of Catholic Health Services of Long Island (CHSLI), is seeking app roval to construct a 300,000-square-foot, six-story addition (Patient Care Pavilion; PCP) to modernize an d accommodate the expected growth of demand for services. GSH is the second ranked hospital for ED visits in Suffolk Coun ty and all of Long Island. It is a Level II Adult Trauma Center, a Level II Pedi atric Trauma Center, a Leve l III Perinatal Center, a Primary Stroke Center and a SAFE-Designated Hosp ital. Claritas population pro jections show an expected 25.8% increase in residents aged 64+ over the next ten years. There will be no change to the fa cility's 437 bed s or services provided as a result of this project. The proposed PCP consists of five (5) levels of clinical programmat ic space and interstitial level for mechanical space, including the following: Level 1: a new entry lobby with visitor access and a new 75-ro om replacement and rightsized Emergency Department with specif ic ED drop-off and ambulance en tries. Additionally, there is a new (replacement) and rightsized Central Sterile Processing Dep artment and connection back to the North Building; Level 2: a new modernized 16-OR surgical platform, including g eneral and hybrid ORs as well as preparation and reco very areas, to replace and right size the e xisting 12 OR and support space; Level 3: centralized main mechani cal and electrical space; and Levels 4,5, and 6: inpatient unit for medical/surgical beds. O ne (1) level of 36 private beds will be constructed and fit out as par t of the current PCP project and the other two (2) levels will be built as shell space for future use a s replacement private inpatient rooms. Staffing is expected to increase as a result of this project b y 74.4 FTEs in Year One and 128.1 FTEs in Year Three of the completed project. GHS's last major expansion proje ct was over 33 years ago. This project will be complet ed over the course of 30 months without disruption of the existing functions of th e inpatient, ED or OR. Emergency Department GSH currently has 48 ED bays. H aving recognized an immediate n eed for more bays, GSH submitted Certificate of Need project 1911 03 to construct a modular out-b uilding connected to the current ED to house an 11-bay pediatric ED, bringing the hospital total to 59 . That project is now under construction. This project will eventually repl ace both the existing ED and t he modular pediatric ED with a completely new 75-bay ED in the first lev el of the propos ed addition. The table below shows the progression of ED visits, historical and project ed, against the parameters of the existing ED, the interim modular addition, and the proposed new ED in this application.

The proposed 75 bays in 55,220 sq uare feet was arrived at after breaking down the actual average ED room minutes per pat ient by specific pat ient type. Throughput targets were developed for each patient type based on average room time , target utilization factors, an d measures to significantly reduce the time patients remain in the ED waiting for a bed. The target is a d oor to floor time of four hours. The table below summarizes this analysis.

Included in the new ED footprint, GSH will have increased embedded imaging to further increase throughput and reduce time waiti ng in the ED. Overall , the proposed ED should comfortably accommodate projected volumes, both average and surge, with imp roved operation an d flexibility for future needs as they arise. Surgery Suite GSH currently operates 12 OR's treating all inpatient surgical needs and some higher-acuity same-day surgeries. A separate six room a mbulatory surgery suite serves lower acuity same-day surgeries and a six-room interventional procedure suite (for cardiac catheteriz ations, EPI's, etc.) complement the main OR suite. The 12 ORs exper ience 93% utilization.

The Department uses an expected benchmark range of 800-1,200 pr ocedures per OR per year. Historic utilization shown above is signi ficantly above t hat benchmark. The applicant's proposal for 16 ORs handling 841 cases per OR is int entionally at the low end of th e range to account for increased inpatient CMI over time, to mitigate the need to run cases after hours, a nd to allow for future g rowth. GSH projects expansion from 12 to 16 ORs w ill reduce utilization from 93% to 75%. Overall, the expansion of the OR suite will relieve near capacity utilization, improve operation s, increase surgeon satisfaction, and provide both surge and future capacity. Project #192324-C Exhibit Page 6 Expansion of Private Inpatient Space GSH's total inpatient bed count will not change as a result of this project. The new Patient Care Pavilion includes a floor of private inpatient beds, increasing their nu mber from 85 to 121 (fr om 19.6% to 27.6% of total). The shell space included in the construction will allo w for future expansion to 193 private beds (44.1% of total).

Compliance with Applicable Codes, Rules and Regulations The medical staff will continue to ensure that the procedures p erformed at the facility conform to generally accepted standards of practice a nd that privileges granted are within the physician's scope of practice and expertise. The Facility's adm issions policy includes anti-d iscrimination provisions regarding age, race, creed, color, national origin, m arital status, sex, sexual orie ntation, religion, dis ability or source of payment. All procedures are perfo rmed in accordance with all ap plicable federal and state codes, rules and regulations. The Facility's a ccreditation is a Medicare dee med survey done by The Joint Commission to insure we comply with all regul ations. A sliding fee scale i s in place for those without insurance and provisions are made for those who cannot afford services. The Department issued a Stipulation and Order (S&O) dated April 28, 2017 and fined Good Samaritan Hospital $2,000 based on an investigation that was completed on Ju ly 25, 2016. Specifically, the facility failed to ensure that the facility's Security Guards, wh o assist with the application of restraints, are trained in first aid techniques and certified in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). Prevention Agenda The applicant states that this pro ject addresses the need to in crease preventive care and the management of chronic disease by enhancing and modernizing the inpatient, emergency and surgical services where chronic diseas e management will occur. The appl icant works with the Long Island Health Collaborative, which is an extens ive workgroup of committed par tners including the local health department to assess the communi ty needs and addr ess the agreed upon Prevention Agenda Priority Focus areas of Chronic Disease , specifically obesity and preven tive care and Promoting Wellbeing and Mental Health. The applicant states that the follo wing interventions are evide nced-based and offered to support the Prevention Agenda goals: Diabetes Management Smoking Cessation Healthy food/beverage choices Cancer prevention and screening Walking campaigns Stress reduction programs and Mental wellness programs Project #192324-C Exhibit Page 7 The applicant states that the follo wing process measures are us ed to track the impact of their efforts: Number of community/screening programs provided, # of resident s reached and # of new participants attending Pre- and post-test score s of program participants Measure awareness and change in k nowledge of obesity by the nu mber of people attending specific programs/seminars and Height/weight/BMI measurements In 2017 the applicant spent $1, 074,311 on community health impr ovement services, representing 0.172% of total operating expenses. Conclusion The proposed Patient Care Pavili on, the first major expansion p roject at Good Samaritan Hospital in over 33 years, appropriately address es the facility's immediate need s while also providing prudent capacity and flexibility for the future. Based on the results of this r eview, a favorable recommendation can be made regarding the facility's cu rrent compliance pursuant to 28 02-(3)(e) of the New York State Public Health Law. Financial Analysis Total Project Cost and Financing Total project cost for the Arti cle 28 space and s hell space is estimated at $525,230,772:: Article 28 Shell Space Total New Construction $263,297, 795 $34,710,372 $298,008,167 $41,353,992 0 $2,000 Additional Processin 0 $2,580,804 Total Pro ject Cost $471,819,943 $53,410,829 $525,230,772 Project costs are based on a cons truction start date of July 1, 2022, and a 30-month construction period. The applicant's financing plan appears as follows: Equit y $125,230,772 Taxable Bond (4% interest, 30- year term ) $400,000,000 Total $525,230,772 The $125,230,772 equity for this application will come from the following sources: approximately $56.5 million in short term investments; approximately $38.6 million in B oard designated investments; a nd approximately $30 million from C HSLI in the form of a CHSLI fu nd transfer to GSH. BFA Attachments B and D show su fficient funds available for the equity contribution. Project #192324-C Exhibit Page 8 CHSLI will seek to secure financing for this project with taxab le bonds in May of 2020. In preparing its cost benefit analysis, GSH/CHSLI c onservatively assumed that th e earliest date tax-exempt bonds could be issued is December 2021. In c onjunction with its Financial Advisor, GSH discovered that the market consensus indicates that curren t rates are very low/attractive with taxable rates (at an all-time low), and overall, rates are most likely to increase after this year goin g into 2021. The tax-exempt analysis prepared at the end of November 2019 indicated an all-in True Interest C ost (TIC) rate of 4.04% in comparison to the taxable all-in TIC rate of 4 .14%. GSH has attempted to proj ect what the 30-year Municipal Market Data (MMD) rates for December 2 021 would have to increase from today so that the tax-exempt issue would have the same present val ue (PV) net debt service as a ta xable issuance today. The analysis prepared indicates that the 30-ye ar MMD wou ld have to increase by 66 basis points to 2.75%. GSH has also been provided information that the percent of time the 30- year MMD equaled 2.75% over the past five years was 63.37% and over the past ten years was 79.68%. This assumes that all of the 66 basis points is attributable to the MMD change and not to other facto rs (credit spread, credit rating, etc.). GSH/CHSLI continues to monitor t he market and movement in 30-ye ar treasury rates (taxable) and 30- year MMD rates (tax-exempt). G oldman, Sachs & Co and Morgan St anley have provided a letter of interest to underwrite the bond. Operating Budget The applicant submitted the current budget (2018) of Good Samar itan Hospital Medical Center, and the projected first- and third-year operating budgets, in 2020 doll ars, summarized below: Current Year (2018 ) Year One Year Three Inpatient Per #192324-C Exhibit Page 9 Current Year (2018 ) Year One Year Three Inpatient Expenses The following is noted with res pect to the current, first and t hird year budgets: The 2018 current yea r revenues an d expenses re flect the operat ions of GSH only, while the revenues and expenses on the 2018 certified financials (BFA Att achment A) include the operations of owned private practices as we ll as other professional corpor ations. Effective January 1, 2020 Medica id payments have been reduced by 1% in accordance with the FY 2020 enacted State budget, therefore reducing the Medicaid Reve nues in Years One and Three. This reduction has been refl ected within the budgets. All Other Revenues include the New York Health Exchange, Worke r's Compensation and No-Fault Insurance. Other Operating revenue of $18, 141,000 is comprised of grant i ncome, rental income, management fee income, cafeteria/coffee shop income and miscellaneous. Revenue assumptions are based on the 2018 prorated percent to total patient revenue by payor at GSH. Expense assumptions are based on historical experience of the facility, new incremental square footage and estimated average salaries, benefits, professional fees, per-unit supply expense, new lab service contracts and new de preciation based on the project . Utilization by payor source during the current, first and thir d years (identical) is as follows: Inpatien t Inpatien 6.49% Total 100.00% 100.00% Capability and Feasibility Total project cost is $525,230,77 2 consisting of Article 28 spa ce for $471,819,943 and shell space construction for $53,410,829. The project cost will be met via $125,230,772 equity and a $400,000,000 taxable bond over 30-year term at 4% interest. Goldman, Sachs & Co and Morgan Stanley have provided a letter of interest to underwrit e the bond. BFA Attachment B indicates sufficient liquid resources to cover the current equity requirem ent for total project cost. There is no working capital need associated with this applicati on because the facility is a going concern that has been in operat ion for many years. Project #192324-C Exhibit Page 10 The submitted budget indicates net operating gains of $30,364,0 00 and $64,499,000 during the first and third years, respectively.

T he clinic will be housed in 12,629 functional gross square feet of program space on the second floor of an existing high-rise building that consists of 27 above grade level floors plus two below grade level floors. The space is currently unoccupied and will be built out and leased to WCINYP for daily operations. The applicant requests certification for Medical Services-Other Medical Specialties, CT Scanner and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) services and will provide CT, X-Ray, MRI, Ultrasound and Mammography scans at th is new location. Through a passive parent relationship, New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medicine entered into a joint venture to form WCINYP with each entity sharing 50% ownership. Currently, W CINYP is certified to operate seven sites; five s ites are located on the East Side of Manhattan, one site is located on the West Side of Manhattan and one site is located in Lower Manha ttan. Over the past few years, the sites have experienced a steady increase in demand for services and WCINYP anticipates continued volume growth leading to capacity constraints and operational challenges at its existing clinics . By certifying the new location, WCINYP will be able to meet current patient care demand, provide access to the latest imaging technologies and modalities, and meet the anticipated radiological needs of other Weill Cornell Medicine Sp ecialties located in Long Island City and Queens. Robert J. Mon, M.D., President and Medical Director of WCINYP and a Board-certified Radiologist, will supervi se the operations of the extension clinic. The Ne w York-Presbyterian Hospital will serve as backup hospital.

(Burdett), a 15- bed, voluntary not-for-profi t, Article 28 maternity hospital located within leased space in Samaritan Hospital, into its operations. Samaritan will be the surviving hospital and corporation. Upon Public Health and Health Planning Council (PHHPC) approval of the merger, the maternity department will continue to use the assumed name Burdett Birth Center. St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP), a not-for- profit healthcare system in New York's Capital Region that operates numerous health facilities, is the sole member, active parent and co- operator of Samaritan and Trinity Health Corporation is the sole member of SPHPs and a co-operator of the SPHP' s licensed facilities. Samaritan consists o f three campuses: 257 beds at the main campus at 2215 Burdett Avenue; 165 beds at Albany Memorial Hospital Campus at 600 Northern Blvd, Albany (recently merged into Samaritan under CON 192045); and 20 Chemical Dependence-Rehabilitation (CD-Rehab) beds at St. Mary's Campus at 1300 Massachusetts Avenue, Troy. Upon completion of this project, Burdett's 15 Maternity beds will be added to Samaritan's o perating certificate resulting in 272 total certified beds (457 beds across all campuses). Burdett was establishe d in 2011 under CON 091172 as a result of the fo rmation of St. Peter's Health Partners to preserve reproductive-related procedures that are prohibited by the Ethical and Religious Directives (E RDs) of the Catholic Church. Burdett was initia lly granted a five-year limited life due to uncertainty as to the financial feasibility of a 15-bed ma ternity hospital The hospital began operations effective October 1, 2011, and in 2016 Burdett w as granted a three- year extension of the limited life (CON 161389) to allow Burdett more time to demonstrate financial feasibility. SPHP was formed in 2011 when SPHP became the sole member and p assive parent of St. Peter's Health Care Services, Northeast Health, Inc., and Seton Health Sys tem, Inc. Prior to this affiliation, Catholic Heal th East (CHE) was the sole member and passive parent of St. Peter's Health Care Services and, due to the 2011 St. Peter's - Northeast Heal th - Seton affiliation, became the sole member and passive parent of SPHP. In 2013, CHE affiliated with Trinity Health, Inc. forming a ne w corporation, CHE Trinity, Inc. (sole membe r of the two entities). In 2014, CHE, Trinity Health, Inc., and CHE Trinity, Inc., merged and the surv iving entity's name became Trinity Health C orporation. In 2019, Trinity became a sec ond active parent/co- operator of the licen sed health care facilities under SPHP. Burdett has been losing m oney for years due to an unfavorable payor mix, significant malpractice, and othe r expenses. It has a significant deficit and projects further operating losses. The merger is expected to deliver governance, administrative and operational efficiencies via one legal board, a single management structure, one set of policies and Project #192206-C Exhibit Page 2 procedures, one medica l and nursing staff, and many unified departments. Reductions in regulatory obligations imposed by federal and state agencies will also be cut in half. On September 26, 2019, Samaritan Hospital became the sole corporate member of Burdett Care Center. Accordingly, Burdett is now part of the SPHP system and abi des by the Ethical and Religious Directives of the Catholic Church and has thus discontinued providing reproductive services prohibited by the ERDs. Post-merger, Burdett will cease to exi st as a separately licensed entity. OPCHSM Recommendation Contingent Approval Need Summary As a stand-alone 15-bed maternity hospital, Burdett is not financially sustainable. Approval of this application will preserve maternity services in Rensselaer County, especially for the significant low-income population; however, as a result other reproductive services prohibited by the ERDs have been di scontinued. Patients residing in Rensselaer County in need of discontinued reproductive health services will be informed of options to ut ilize the Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood in Troy and two private physician offices who w ill perform reproductive procedures at Albany Medical Center. Medicaid will cover the cost of tr ansportation services. Program Summary Based on the results of th is review, a favorable recommendation can be made regarding the facility's current comp liance pursuant to 2802- (3)(e) of the New York S tate Public Health Law. Financial Summary There are no project costs or acquisition price associated with this application. Samaritan Hospital of Troy, NY Inc. has submitted an affidavit that they will provide additional funding to cover any net operating losses.

[DFH] Council Action Date July 30, 2020 Project #192206-C Exhibit Page 4 Need Analysis Background Samaritan Hospital located a t 2215 Burdett Ave, Troy, NY 12180 is seeking approval to merge The Burdett Care Center, In c. d/b/a Burdett Bir th Center (\"Burdett\" ) into Samaritan Hospital. This project will result in the addition of 15 maternity beds to Samaritan and th e closure of Burdett Care Center. Both hospitals are affiliated with S t. Peter's Health Partners.

ADC Occ. ADC Occ. Obstetric as been approximately 45% over the past th ree years with an average daily census (ADC) of approximately 6.6 pati ents. A significant percentage o f the births are to pat ients with Medicaid as the payor. Birth Data and Assessment of Impact on Perinatal Designation Burdett Care Center is currently a Level I Perinatal Center in Rensselaer County, affiliated with the Capital District Regional Perinatal Center at Albany Medical Ce nter. Their annual births between 2012 and 2016 range from 991 to 1,183 . Through the merger, Samarita n Hospital would receive a presumptive designation of a Level I birthi ng hospital unde r current public health regulations (10 NYCRR 721). The transfer of maternity beds from one entity to another co-lo cated provider has no anticipated impact on deliveries or bed utilization and would not have an impact o n the hospital's current level of perinatal designation. Impact on Access to Reproductive Health Services Burdett Care Center w as formed as a result of the October 1, 20 11 merger among Northeast Health, Seton Health System, and St. Pet er's Health Care Services, and the formation of St. Peter's Health Partners. As a condition of mergi ng with two Catholic systems, Northeast Health agreed to cease providing services that conflict ed with the Catholic Ethical an d Religious Directive s, such as abortion, tubal ligation, and vasectomy. N ortheast Health a nd its subsid iary Samaritan Hospital formed the Burdett Care Center, a co-located facilit y that was not included in the merger, as a way to preserve access to comprehensive reproductive health services while proceeding wit h the merger. When Samaritan Hospital became Burdett's sole corporate member in September 2019, all ERD- prohibited reproductiv e health services ceased. There are limi ted reproductive health services available to residents of Rensse laer County. Upper H udson Planned Parent hood (UHPP) is a contractor for the Project #192206-C Exhibit Page 5 Department's Family Planning Prog ram, which provides comprehens ive, confidential reproductive health services to low-income, uninsured/underinsured people of reprod uctive age, including adolescents. However, not all reproductive he alth services, such as tubal li gation or postpartum long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), are avail able at UHPP or elsewhere in the County. Conclusion Approval of this application is i ntended to preserve maternity services in Rensselaer County, especially for the significant low-income population, even though other re productive services pr ohibited by the ERDs have been discontinued. Program Analysis Program Description Burdett submitted the facility cl osure plan that has been revie wed by the Departmen t. The facility closure plan includes notifying the communi ty by posting information ab out the merger on both hospitals' websites and issuing a press re lease to the major local news an d television stations. This application does not seek to add new services. It seeks to merge two hospitals and combine their existing services. This CON brin gs the two hospitals under the same operating certificate. Maternity services and 15 maternity beds will be added to Samaritan Hospi tal's operating certificate. Staffing levels will increase by 127.2 FTEs in t he first year and decrease by 4 3.7 FTEs in the third year. Compliance with Applicable Codes, Rules and Regulations The medical staff will continue to ensure that the procedures p erformed at the facility conform to generally accepted standards of practice a nd that privileges granted are within the physician's scope o practice and expertise. The Facility's admissi ons policy includes anti-discr imination provisions regarding age, race, creed, color, national origin, m arital status, sex, sexual orie ntation, religion, dis ability or source of payment. All procedures are perfo rmed in accordance with all ap plicable federal and state codes, rules and regulations. The Facility's a ccreditation is a Medicare dee med survey done by The Joint Commission to insure we comply with all regul ations. A sliding fee scale i s in place for those without insurance and provisions are made for those who cannot afford services. This facility has no outstanding Article 28 surveillance or enf orcement actions and, based on the most recent surveillance informati on, is deemed to be currently oper ating in substantial compliance with all applicable State and Federal codes, rules, and regulations. Thi s determination was made based on a review of the files of the Depar tment of Health, including all pertinent records and reports regarding the facility's enforcement history and the results of routine Artic le 28 surveys as well as investigations of reported incidents and complaints. Prevention Agenda Samaritan's application does no t specify how the proposed proje ct advances local Prevention Agenda priorities. It does state that St. Peter's Health Partners is i mplementing the following interventions to support two Preventi on Agenda focus areas: Reduce Obesity in Children and Adults: Pre-diabetes screening s and education through the use of evidence-based tools; Self-management programs; nutrition and b everage standards in public institutions, worksit es, school districts, and childcare center s; physical activity promotion in childcare centers, school districts, community venues, and worksites. Prevent Substance Abuse and othe r Mental Emotional Behavioral Disorders: Provi der education on addiction and pain management; New York State Opioid Overdose P revention Training; ambulatory detox service locations. The application states that Samar itan and St. Peter's Health Pa rtners engaged the Healthy Capital District Initiative (HCDI) and o ther community partners in thei r Prevention Agenda efforts. Samaritan cites Project #192206-C Exhibit Page 6 data indicators that it tracks to m easure progress toward achie ving local Prevention Agenda goals, including: Percentage of youth who are obese Percentage of adults who are obese Hospitalizations among patient s 18 and over for short-term com plications of diabetes In 2016 the applicant spent $435,920 on community health improv ement services, representing 0.249% of total operating expenses. Conclusion Based on the results of this rev iew, a favorable recommendation can be made regarding the facility's current compliance pursuant to 2802-(3)(e) of the New York Stat e Public Health Law. Financial Analysis Certificate of Merger The applicant has submitted an executed Certificate of Merger a s summarized below: Date: October 14, 2019 Merging Entities: Burdett Care Center, In c and Samaritan Hospital of T roy, NY Surviving Entity: Samaritan Hospital of Troy NY, Inc Operating Budget The applicant has submitted the current year (FYE 6/30/19) and projected first and third year operating budgets (457 beds), in 2020 dollars, as summarized below: (*In Thousands ) Current Year (2019 ) Year One Three Inpatient Per Disch 7 (*In Thousands ) Current Year (2019 ) Year One Year Three Inpatient following is noted with res pect to the first and third year budgets: Effective January 1, 2020, Medica id payments have been reduced by 1% in accordance with the FY 2020 Enacted State Budget, ther efore reducing the Medicaid R evenues in Years One and Three. This reduction has been reflected within the budgets. The current year budget is the ac cumulation of revenues and ex penses from Samaritan Hospital's fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, accumulated six months for th e St. Mary's Cam pus as of June 30, 2019 (the facility became a divisi on of Samaritan Hospital effe ctive January 1, 2019), accumulated six months for Albany Memorial H ospital as of June 30, 2019 (th e facility became a division of Samaritan Hospital effective on or about January 1, 2020), and twelve months of operation for the Burdett Care Center as of Decem ber 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Burdett had a net operating loss of $1,022,302. Other Operating revenue includ es cafeteria, grants, rent, and assets released from restrictions. First and Third Year budgeted rates are based on the contracte d negotiated rates and proposed Medicare rates. Expenses and ut ilization assumptions ar e based on Samaritan Ho spital's experience and strategic initiatives. Revenue assumptions are based on current reimbursement methodo logies as well as current and historical utilization. Burdett has been experiencing lo sses are a result of their pay or mix being predominantly 55% Medicaid and self-pay. Per thei r 2018 cost report filing, Medi caid patients accounted for 56.3% of total discharges and uninsured/se lf-pay patients accounted for 2.5% of the total. Outpatient utilization was 53% Medicaid. T he applicant indicated that rei mbursement rates for Medicaid and payments from uninsured/self-pay p atients have not keep pace wi th maternity service expense increases, primarily labor cost s, resulting in financial constr aints. Project #192206-C Exhibit Page 8 Utilization by payor for the cu rrent year, and anticipated for the first and third years is as follows: Inpatient Dischar ges 2019 100.00% 100.00% Capability and Feasibility There are no project costs or acquisition price associated with this application. T he submitted budget projects a net operating loss of $226,000 and a net income of $ 8,665,000 for the first and third years, respectively. The improvement i n profitability by Year Three is primarily driven by the realization of operating expense efficiencies th rough the consolidation of the St. Mary's, Albany Memorial, and Burdett operations into Samaritan. Sama ritan Hospital of Troy, NY, Inc . has submitted an a ffidavit that they will provide additional funding from Board Designated Funds under As sets limited to use on the balance sheet to be available to cover any net oper ating losses as nece ssary. BFA Attachment B shows sufficient funds. The budget appears to be reasonable. BFA Attachment A is the 2018-201 9 consolidated certified financ ial statements of St. Peter's Health Partners Albany, NY, which shows positive working capital and n et asset positions and a positive net operating income of $11,548,000 for the year ending June 30, 20 19. BFA Attachment B is the June 30, 2019 supplemental certified fi nancial data for Samaritan Hospital, which shows negative working capi tal, a positive net asset posi tion and an operating loss before other items of $1,482,000 offset by rest ructuring costs, earnings in Trinity Health pooled investment programs and investment earnings realizing an excess of revenue over exp enses of $1,675,000. The applicant stated that Samaritan's negativ e working capital of $59,253,000 is due to the merger of St. Mary's Hospital into its operation e ffective January 1, 2019. St. Mar y's audit as of December 31, 2018 shows a negative working capital position of $30,425,000 that was broug ht over to the Samaritan balance sheet. There was also an impact r elated to an increase in the accrued salaries and wages liability due to the timing of payroll, which w as another $3 m illion dollars app roximately. BFA Attachment B also shows the operating results of Albany M emorial Hospital, which had po sitive working capital and net assets positions for the period ending June 30, 2019, and an operating income before other items of $4,303,000. BFA Attachment C is The Burde tt Care Center's internal financia l statements as of September 30, 2019, which shows negative working capital, a negative net asset posi tion and a net operating loss of $1,741,433 on total revenue of $4, 767,121 (or a - 36.53% operati ng margin). The applicant indicated that the loss is a result of Burdett' s payor mix being approximately 55% Medicaid and self-pay with insufficient increases in reimbursement to k eep up with labor and other expe nse increases. The merger of Burdett Care Center into Samar itan Hospital will pre serve maternity ser vices in the Troy community. Samaritan Hospital is a member of St. Peter 's Health Partners, which has the resources available to provide funding to support continuing maternity-related services. The applicant has demonstrated t he capability to proceed in a f inancially feasible manner.

Za~.e: General Coun~ March 3, 2020 Massena Memorial Hospital Foundation, Inc. Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation Massena Memorial Hospital Foundation, Inc. (\"MMH Foundation\") proposes to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to broaden the corporate purpose and the geographic scope of the foundation to allow it to remain financially viable in order to continue its charitable mission. The MMH Foundation also proposes a name change and change of address for purposes of service of process of receiving service of process. The MMH Foundation was formed to provide financial support to the municipal Massena Memorial Hospital. Massena Memorial Hospital has reorganized and is now a member of the St. Lawrence Health System (\"St. Lawrence\"). St. Lawrence has its own charitable foundation, the Canton-Potsdam Memorial Foundation and it is anticipated that the MMH Foundation and the Canton-Potsdam Foundation will overlap in their respective charitable missions. This overlap will make it more difficult for the MMH Foundation to raise funds and remain operational, unless its corporate purposes are broadened to include a wider geographic scope of operations to allow it to pursue different health initiatives. The proposed amendments will allow MMH Foundation to maintain its current donors while expanding and attracting new donors for different health initiatives. The MMH Foundation will continue to support the hospital in Massena and its broader purpose will allow it to explore new currently underfunded initiatives, including initiatives on the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation and underserved areas that surround the town of Massena. Part of the legal review of the application involved reviewing the Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation for the MMH Foundation to allow it to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to change its corporate purposes. The Certificate cannot be filed with the New York State Department of State without having PHHPC's consent to file attached thereto. Therefore, PHHPC is being asked to grant consent to the filing. The document has been reviewed. There is no legal objection to the proposed Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation of the MMH Foundation and it is in legally acceptable form.

(the MMH Foundation\") that broaden the corporate purpose and geographic scope of the Foundation are necessary in order for the Foundation to remain financially viable and able to continue its charitable mission. The Foundation was originally formed to provide financial support to the municipal Massena Memorial Hospital. As you are aware, Massena Memorial Hospital has reorganized and became a member hospital of the St. Lawrence Health System that has its own charitable foundation, the Canton-Potsdam Hospital Foundation. It is anticipated that the overlap of the charitable missions . of the MMH-Foundationand the Canton-Potsdam Hospital F oundationwill make it more\u00ad difficult for the MMH Foundation to raise funds unless the corporate purposes of the MMH Foundation are broadened to include different health initiatives and a larger geographic scope. In order for the MMH Foundation to continue its charitable mission, it is necessary to not only maintain current donors but to also attract new donors \\)y funding health initiatives that go beyond only supporting the hospital in the town of Massena. The MMH Foundation will continue to support the hospital in Massena and the broader charitable purposes will permit the MMH Foundation to fund new health care initiatives that are currently underfunded, including health initiatives on the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation and in the underserved areas that surround the town of Massena. Such activities will attract new donors beyond the current base of donors that support the MMH Foundation. The proposed amendments will also facilitate the HINMAN STRAUB P.C.

(the Foundation) requests Public Health and Health Planning Council (PHHPC) approval of its proposed dissolution in accordance with the requirements of Not-For-Profit Corporation Law\u00a7 1002(c) and\u00a7 1003, as well as 1 0 NYCRR Part 650. Hebrew Hospital Home Foundation, Inc. is a New York not-for-profit corporation incorporated on August 5, 1986 to fundraise for the Hebrew Hospital Home System and related health-care organizations. Through the following years, the Hebrew Hospital Home System was comprised of various legal entities that operated both Article 28 hospitals and Article 36 home care agencies. The Foundation solicited funds to support the operation of these Article 28 hospitals and Article 36 home care agencies. Many of the entities within the Hebrew Hospital Home System have since been sold ana wound down or have otherwise ceased operations due to bankruptcy or other financial difficulties. For this reason, and for the reason that the Foundation no longer has the personnel resources to support operations, the Foundation has determined it is in its best interests to dissolve. Presently, Hebrew Hospital Home System will begin the process for winding down and dissolving the affiliated entities that remain in existence, which are as follows: HHH Home Care, Inc, former operator of an Article 36 licensed home care agency that ceased operations in 2015; Hebrew Hospital Home, Inc, former operator of an Article 28 residential health care facility sold in 2007; and HHCS, Inc., the entity providing administrative support throughout the Heb~ew Hospital Home System. The Foundation has set aside funds to cover legal fees and other costs associated with winding down HHH Home Care, Inc and Hebrew Hospital Home, Inc. The Foundation will distribute any remaining funds to UGC Foundation Inc., a New York not-for-profit corporation with a mission to support programs to meet the special needs of the elderly in Westchester County. Under Not-For-Profit Corporation Law \u00a71002(c) and Public Health Law \u00a72801-a(1), as a not-for\u00ad profit corporation previously approved by PHHPC to have the corporate purpose of soliciting contributions for the operation of hospitals within the Hebrew Hospital Home System, the Foundation requires PHHPC approval to dissolve The Board of Directors of the Foundation adopted a Plan of Dissolution by unanimous written consent on February 21, 2020. The Foundation has no members.

In recent yenrs, portions of the Hebrew\u00b7Hospital Home system have been sold and wound down. Entities within the system that were not sold have since ceased operations and gone dormant. Because of this, the Foundation believes it is in its best interest to dissolve. Because the Public Health and Health Plannjng Council (the \"Council\") originally consented to the filing of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Foundation , the Foundation seeks the Council's consent 10 its dissolution and related documents as required by the New York Not-for-Profit Corporation Law. The following documents are enclosed for the Council's review and approval: (I) a copy of the proposed fonn of Verified Petition to be submitted to the Attorney General requesting approval of the Plan of Dissolution and Distribution of Assets; (2) a copy of the proposed Plan of Dissolution and Distribution of Assets; and (3) a copy of the proposed Certificate of Dissoiution.

The organization proposed to receive the Foundation's assets following the wind\u00ad down processes described in Paragraph 5 herein is a charitable organization engaged in activities substantially similar to the Foundation's activities and consistent with any specific diss<:lution requirement specified in the Foundation's Certificate of Incorporation. For the organization proposed in this Plan to receive the Foundation's assets, the following documents are attached as Exhibit A: 8038873_4 a. The Certificate of Incorporation, with all amendments; b. The most recent financial report; and c.

In addition to Attorney General approval, the approval of the New York Public Health and Health Planning Council is required and a copy of such approval will be attached to the Verified Petition submitted to the Attorney General. 5. The Foundation has set aside $15,000 to pay for estimated legal fees and costs related to the Foundation wind down and dissolution processes. It has also set aside $25,000 to pay for estimated legal fees and costs related to the wind down and dissolution processes for Hebrew Hospital Home, Inc. and HHH Home Care, Inc., affiliated entities of the Foundation.

In January 2016, NYULH established a comprehensive Transplant Institute to provide patients with quality transplantation services and pre- and post-transplant care that incorporates the latest medical advancements. The Institute consists of multidisciplinary teams of medical and surgical specialists with Robert A. Montgomery, M.D., a Board-certified surgeon with extensive organ tran splant experience, as its Director. The Pediat ric Heart Transplant Program will function in existing inpatient and outpatient space on the main hospital campus, with the clinical program developed and managed in conjunction with Hassenfeld Children's Hospital, NYULH's nexus for children's services, and the NYULH Transplant Institute. NYU Langone Health consists of the following inpatient entities loca ted throughout the New York City area: Tisch Hos pital, Kimmel Pavilion, Hassenfeld Children's Hospital, NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital, Rus k Rehabilitation, and NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn. OPCHSM Recommendation Approval Need Summary At this time, although N YS has three approved pediatric heart transplant p rograms, only one is performing a significant number of transplants. Historically, Mount Sinai and Montefiore have been low volume program s and for the last two years Montefiore's volume of procedures has decreased, and Mount Sinai has performed virtually no pediatri c heart transplants. NYULH's plans include the establishment of a pediatric lung transplant program and heart-lung transplant program for children, both, however, are contingent upon the st ate's approval of this application for a PHTP program. At this time, there are no pediatric he art-lung programs in NYS. Program Summary NYULH opened its adult heart and lung program in 2018. Providing hear t transplant services to pediatric patients is a n atural extension of NYULH's existing adul t heart transplant program. Both the adult heart and adult lung transplant programs have successfully transferred patients turned down by other local transplant centers and maintain outcomes better than the regional or national averages. The applicant projects to perform one pediatric health transplant in Year One, three and Year Two, and four in Year T hree of a new program. The objective is to expand upon NYULH's transplant treatment strat egies to include a pediatric continuum of care.

[HSP] Council Action Date July 30, 2020 Project #192008-C Exhibit Page 5 Need and Program Analysis Proposal and Background NYULH provides a wide array o f inpatient and outpatient pediatr ic services in its primary service area of metropolitan NYC and Long Island. NYULH and its affiliates inc luding Winthrop Hospital had approximately 22,000 inpatient pediatric discharges, 45,000 ped iatric emergency department visits, and 16,600 deliveries in 2018. They hav e a pediatric congenital hea rt surgery program with approximately 200 cases per year with survival ra tes that exceed the national ave rage in a number of key categories and a post-op length of stay lower than the national average. The proposed pedi atric heart transplant p rogram (PHTP) will be established within NYULH's Transplant Institute (TI). The TI, an organi zational structure that brings all of NYULH's transplant services together under one umbrella department, w as established in 2016. The TI currently houses the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) approved kidney, liver, pancreas, lung and adult heart transplant programs. The TI's aggressive outreach, eval uation, listing efforts and donor management practices have contributed to increases in the number of trans plants of all of the above-list ed organs at NYULH and statewide. The NYULH TI is a member and activ ely engaged in the work of the Ne w York Center for Liver Transplantation, Center for Kidney Transplantation and the NY C ardiothoracic Transplant Consortium. Since 2011, NYULH has operated an adult Ventricular Assist Devi ce (VAD) program, accredited by The Joint Commission (TJC), providing mechanical circulatory suppor t for patients in acute cardiogenic shock and with chronic advanced heart fa ilure as destination and brid ge to transplantation therapy. The program was recently re-certifi ed. NYULH's VAD survival and qua lity outcomes surpass national registry benchmarks. NYULH opened its adult heart and lu ng transplant programs in 20 18. As of February 20, 2020, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) reports that NYULH ha s performed 78 adult heart and 67 adult lung transplants. The applic ant reports that both the ad ult heart and adult lung transplant programs have evaluated and successfully tr ansplanted patients turned do wn by other local transplant centers and maintained outcomes better than the regional and national avera ge. As a condition of the 2018 approv al of the adult heart transpla nt program (AHTP), NYULH was required to develop and implement a five-y ear plan to create a system-wi de institutional culture of organ donation and support for enrollment in the NYS Donate Life Registry. Req uired components of the plan included committing and devoting resources to: Implementation of programs to promote health and prevent disea ses associated with the need for organ donation; Improving communication and coor dination with the organ procur ement organizations; Developing specific organ/ti ssue donor identification and refe rral strategies and proactive organ donor management improvement activities; Supporting research to advance organ donor referral, managemen t, recovery, preservation, and enrollment in the NYS Donate Life Registry; Working to increase awareness , education, and accountability o f staff throughout the health systems facilities and the communities they serve; and Collaborating with the Departm ent, the NYS Transplant Council and statewide organizations to share results and practices. NYULH is implementing the cond itions set forth in the approval of their adult heart transplant program, and the number of heart and lung transplants performed in New Y ork State since NY ULH opened its adult program has increased. The appl icant reports that even factorin g out the heart transpl ants performed by their program, there wa s a seven percent increase in adult hear t transplants statewide. Project #192008-C Exhibit Page 6 The applicant seeks to enhance t he breadth of transplantation s ervices that NYULH provides to include pediatric heart transplantation se rvices. They plan to provide such services within the existing physical plant of the Kimmel Pavilion and in conjunction with the practi tioners and services provided by its pediatric program, known as Hass enfeld Children's Hospital (HCH ). HCH houses a pediatric Congenital Cardiovascular Care Unit (CCVCU), a cardiac catheter ization and electrophysiology lab as well as a Labor and Delivery U nit, Newborn Nur sery and Neonatal ICU. The applicant reports that pediatri c cardiologists at HCH curre ntly care for children with heart disease, diagnosing congenital heart defects and acquired heart disease in infants, children, and adolescents using advanced cardiac imaging technology, echocardiology, card iac catheterization, treadmill stress testing, and electrophysiology testing. To support the cardiac and respiratory needs of adults and children with heart and/or lung failure, NYULH implemented a pediatric a nd adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program i n 2015. The applicant reports that their ECMO survival outcomes exceed benchmarks. When surgical treatment is the HCH pedi atric cardiolo gists work collaboratively with the pediatric cardiac surgical team. Currently, cardiac surgeons at the HCH perform approximately 200 cardiac surgeries per year, including cardiac reconstructive pr ocedures on infants and children in those with complex cardiovascular di sorders and congenital heart defe cts. The applicant reports that for pediatric patients under going heart surgery, NYULH's survival r ates exceed the national average in a number of key categories, and their post-op length of stay afte r cardiac surgery is lower than the national average. The applicant reports that there are a number of children under the care of NYULH HCH physicians that are currently in need of a heart tr ansplant, and they have refe rred six pediatric patient s to other facilities for heart transplant evaluati on in the last year. The applican t projects that they will perform one pediatric heart transplant in Year One, thr ee in Year Two and four in Yea r Three of a new program. The applicant identifies the serv ice area of the proposed pedia tric heart transplant program, by the geographic area served by NYULH a s well as its affiliate hospit als encompassing all five boroughs of NYC as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties. They describe an ou treach plan that includes visits to community physicians located in areas where there are few or no patients on the waitlist, educating hospitals on the indications for heart transplantation and how to refer patients for rapid evaluation, ensuring transplant physicians availabilit y 24 hours a day for emergent evaluation and transfer, and implementing other strategies t hat are effective in promoting a wareness of their adul t heart transplant program. The applicant's position is that limited and carefully consider ed growth in the number of approved transplant programs stimulates g rowth in organ donation and tra nsplant, rather than simply spreading the same number of cases am ong transplant providers. NYULH currently holds UNOS approv al and CMS certification for i ts heart transplant program. CMS allows facilities with adult hear t transplant certification to perform both adult and pediatric transplants as long as the volume of the pediatri c transplants th ey perform do es not exceed 49% of their total transplant volume. Currently, UNOS does n ot differentiate adult from ped iatric program applications or approvals, however, they are in the process of implementing changes that w ill require all facilities seeking to provide transplant services to apply s eparately for adult and pediatric program approvals. Therefore, NYULH does not need to apply to either U NOS or CMS to establish a new pediatric heart transplant program. NYULH plans to expand its VAD p rogram to the pediatric populati on and begin to perform pediatric lung transplants upon approval and im plementation of their pediatric heart transplant program.

The one-year observed-to-expected post-transplant mortality rate is within the expected range for all New York transplant centers. The De partment believes Montefiore's higher number is due to the small number of children on their list. LiveOnNY, the New York City Metr o-area organ procurement agency (OPO), supplied a le tter of support for NYULH's application. LiveOnN Y, who has previously attested to NYULH's outreach and efforts to develop donation improvement pro grams both within and outside o f the facility, strongly supports the need for another pediatric heart tr ansplant program in NYS and the need for a program in NYS that is capable of performing simultaneou s pediatric heart-lung transpl ants. Project #192008-C Exhibit Page 10 Although not noted in their letter, LiveOnNY and NYULH work clo sely together on donation and transplantation related research and in promoting best practice s in organ dono r management. SRTR data for July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019, as indicated in Table 4, shows the main NYULH campus is above the expected do nation rate and identifies oppor tunities for improvement at the Brooklyn, Winthrop, and Bellevue campuses .

Initial certification of NYULH's adult heart and lung transplant programs was granted in 2018 and initial ce rtification of their pancreas transplant program was granted in 2019. The facility has no outstanding Article 28 surveillance or enfo rcement actions and, based on the most recent surveillance informati on, is deemed to be currently oper ating in substantial compliance with all applicable State and Federal codes, rules, and regulations. Thi s determination was made based on a review of the files of the Depar tment of Health, including all pertinent records and reports regarding the facility's enforcement history and the results of routine Artic le 28 surveys as well as investigations of reported incident s and complaints. NYU Langone Hospitals are a ccredited by The Joint Commission and have achieved advanced certificat ion for their advanced compreh ensive stroke center , ventricular assist device program, advance care prog ram, inpatient diab etes program and perinatal care services. Ad Hoc Expert Review Committee (Review Committe e) Discussion The Department convened a committee consisting of experts in th e field to review the application, provide feedback as to its strengths and weaknesses, and make recommend ations to the Commissioner of Health and PHHPC. The Review Committee was facilit ated by Department staff and in cluded: representation from the NYS Transplant Council (TC); a NYS transplant pro gram administrator; a pediatric heart transplant s urgeon and cardiologist from non -competing out-of-state programs recommended by the NYS Cardiac Advisory Committee (CAC); and a chief operating officer from a large out-of-state organ proc urement organization Review Committee members were provided with the following infor mation for review and evaluation: Relevant components of the CON application and attachments; NYULH's response to the Depart ment's request for additional in formation; UNOS/OPTN and SRTR data for vo lumes, outcomes, transplant rate s and other data regarding existing heart transpl ant centers in NYS; Volumes and mortality for the NYULH's other transplant program s; A copy of the most recent Repor t of the NYS CAC on Pediatric C ongenital Cardiac Surgery Data (2010-13); and Information regarding public c omment received about the applic ation. Committee members were instruct ed to review the proposed progra m on the merits of the application and material supplied. Each member was asked their thoughts and opi nions and discussion followed. Project #192008-C Exhibit Page 11 Committee members noted: The active pediatric, pediatric cardiology and pediatric cardi ac surgical programs at NYULH that have demonstrated good outcomes; The existing pediatric cardiac an d surgery infrastructure with in the NYULH system is likely to be able to leverage existing servic es and patients served by them to generate a waitlist and supports the number of pediatric heart tran splants projected for their n ew program; NYULH's has an existing physical plant capable of providing pe diatric heart transp lant services at asing the number of non-heart t ransplants over the last few years and in establishing an active, succe ssful adult hear t transplant pr ogram without negatively impacting the performance of existing adult programs as they grew; The contributions that active out reach, acceptance of hard to place organs, listing of patients turned down by other centers, and imple mentation of assertive donor ma nagement techni ques have had on reaching the desire d volumes and outc omes of the adult heart and other organ transplant programs; The likelihood that a new pedi atric heart transplant program a t NYULH would r eceive UNOS approval based on the: o credentials of the pediatric ca rdiology and transplant surgica l team members; o presence of existing transplantation services structures upon which the new program would build; and o strong quality assurance and performance improvement program ( QAPI) described by the applicant. The existence of three establis hed pediatric heart transplant (PHTP) programs in NYS all located in NYC; and The active nature of the PHTP p rogram at Columbia performing a pproximately 30 PHTP per year, and the low to no volume nature of the Montefiore and Mt. Sinai PHTP programs for a number of years. The need for another pedi atric heart transplant program in New York was discussed extensively. The Committee noted that the number o f PHTP programs a state \"needs \" is influenced by m any factors, not the least of which is the number of pediatric hearts available for transplantation. Committee members raised questions as to whether Montefiore and /or Mount Sinai intended to continue to perform PHTP. Although the an swer to this que stion was unkn own, the Committee did not feel that it would make much difference because of their low volumes, and it was thought that Columbia had the capacity to accommodate more transplants if need be. Questions/topics discussed included: Whether or not there was an evident unmet disease burden in NY S that would require increased PHTP capacity: o The Committee did not see evide nce of unmet need. They noted that the size of a facility's pediatric congenital heart program was generally a predictor of disease burden and volume of an associated pediatri c heart transplant p rogram. They noted th at NYULH's congenital heart surgery program performs approxim ately 200 cases a year and tha t the volume of PHTP projected, 1, 3 and 4 in Years O ne, Two and Three, respectively , were thought to be appropriate, especially in a new program. They also noted that there was capacity at the existing programs sufficient to meet the need. Whether children on existing NYS PHTP program waiting lists we re dying at a higher than expected rate before they could receive a transplant: o The data did not support this conclusion. Whether opening a new program w ould destabilize any existing p rograms: o Committee members did not believe opening a new program would destabilize Columbia and that the impact of a new program on the two existing low volume programs was unclear. o The Department has received no public comment in support or op position from any of the existing heart transplant programs. The committee discussed the appl icant's argument that establish ing a new program at NYULH would facilitate continuity of care fo r the applicant's patients. Co mmittee members did not disagree with this Project #192008-C Exhibit Page 12 assessment but made the point tha t there are many hospitals wit h pediatric cardiology and congenital heart surgery programs that do no t perform pediatric heart tran splants because this is such a specialized service requiring significant res ources In this c ase, PHTP ser vices are already available in this service area and are costly to establish and maintain when the needs of these children could be met by collaboration between practitioner s and existing programs, rath er than opening a new program. Committee members noted that one-third of the pediatric heart t ransplants perfo rmed in NYS were performed on out-of-state resident s, but they were not persuade d that out-of-state children could not be served by the existing programs in New York or by programs in t he nearby states of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. At the time the Re view Committee met, data regar ding the number of NYS residents seeking pediatric heart transplant s out-of-state was not availa ble. The committee felt strongly tha t the shortage, or need, that ex ists is in the availabi lity of pediatric hearts donated and available for transpla ntation rather than the avail ability of programs to pro vide pediatric heart transplant services. They noted that strategies that work to i ncrease the number of hearts transplanted in the adult population, e.g. accept ing hard to place hearts and l isting patients turned down by other programs, will not necessarily h ave the same effect in a pediat ric program. Review Committee Recommendation The Review Committee did not believe that an additional pediatr ic heart transplant program was needed in NYS given that there are alr eady three approved PHTP program s in NYS and that Columbia can increase the number of transplant s that they perform to accommo date the low number of PHTP projected by NYULH and the volume historically performed by Mount Sinai a nd Montefiore should they close their programs. Therefore, although the merits of the applicati on would support approval, the Review Committee recommends disapproval of this applicati on based on a lack of demonstrated need. Additional Data As noted above, at the time of the Review Committee, data regar ding NYS residents se eking out-of-state pediatric heart transplants was unavailable. Subsequently, dat a provided to the applicant by UNOS and shared with the Department indicates that NYS children are incr easingly going out of state to receive their heart transplants. This is of concern because of the implicati ons it has for children and families without the means or insurance coverage to travel to and receive this s pecialized care provided at an out of state facility. Prevention Agenda NYU Langone states that the proposed project advances Preventio n Agenda 2019-2024 priorities identified by the community in t he most recently completed Comm unity Health Improvement Plan/Community Service Plan by promoting healthy infants and ch ildren within the Promoting Health Women, Infants and Children prio rity area. The applicant identi fies Preventing Ch ronic Disease and Promoting Health Women, Infant s and Children as the Prevention Agenda priorities the applicant will address. NYU Langone identifies several in terventions across various sec tors the applicant is participating in to advance the Promote H ealthy Women, Infants and Children and Pre venting Chronic Disease priority areas by decreasing rates of childhood and adolescent obesity a nd reducing disparities: ParentCorps in community-bas ed early childhood education setti ngs and schools; Implement the Greenlight health literacy/parent engagement pro gram in the primary care setting; Implement the Health Families/Pr ograma de Familias Saludables, a Pediatric Obesity Intervention in the primary care setting; Develop a Two Generations model in the primary care setting to address maternal/child health for high-risk families; Develop and implement a community health worker program in low -income housing to improve management of chronic illness; and Increase capacity among communi ty partners and physicians to a ddress tobacco use. Project #192008-C Exhibit Page 13 NYU Langone Hospitals actively partners with numerous with mult iple community partners across various sectors, including the New York City Department of Health and M ental Health to address the Prevention Agenda priorities. To measure the performance and progress of their interventions, the applicant will monitor levels of participation, patient satisfact ion and impact on health and we ll-being. In 2017 NYU Langone Hospitals s pent $3,249,891 on community hea lth improvement services, representing 0.086% of to tal operating expenses. OPCHSM Conclusion NYULH's application reflects tha t they are a health care system dedicated to increasi ng the availability of organ transplantation to the popul ation they serve by contribut ing to research relevant to the field, working to identify and develop techniques to improve organ donor manag ement, contribute to t he education of practitioners in both transplan t and non-transp lant facilities and promote enrollment in the NYS Donate Life Registry. The application and responses to requests for additional inform ation assured the Review Committee and the Department that NYULH has t he structure and resources to im plement a pediatric heart transplant program that would meet UNOS re quirements for approval and prov ide quality pediat ric heart transplant- related care. At this time, although NYS has thr ee approved pediatric heart t ransplant programs, only one is performing a significant number o f transplants. Historically, Mount Sinai and Montefiore have been low volume programs and for the last two year s Montefiore's volume of proc edures has decreased, and Mount Sinai has performed virtually no pediatric heart transplants. NYULH's plans include the est ablishment of a pediatric lung tra nsplant program and heart-lung transplant program for children, both, how ever, are contingent upon the st ate's approval of this application for a PHTP program. At this time, there are no pediatric heart-lung programs in NYS. Based on all of the informati on and data evaluated, the OPCHSM recommendation differs from that of the Review Committee; OPCHSM recomm ends approval of the application . Project #192008-C Exhibit Page 14 Financial Analysis Operating Budget The applicant has submitted an incremental operating budget, in 2020 dollars, during the first and third years, summarized below: Year One Year Three Inpatient Revenues Per Disch. Revenues Per Visi t $31,398 $879,131 Rev. over Exp. $30,388 $1,144,653 Utilization Pediatric Heart Transplants 1 4 Total Inpt Dischar ges 6 12 Total Outpt Visits 28 168 The following is noted for the fi rst- and third-year incrementa l budgets: Effective January 1, 2020, Medica id payments have been reduced by 1% per the FY 2020 Enacted State Budget, therefore reducing t he Medicaid Revenues in Years One and Three. This reduction has been reflected within the budgets. Inpatient revenue and expenses r epresent patient transplants, patients who are admitted and evaluated for transplant but are not transplanted, and transpla nt readmissions. Revenue assumptions are based on the actual data for current N YULH heart transplant and Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD ) patients. Total revenue was c alculated by applying the rates of utilization using a combination of heart transplant and LVAD pr ogram experience, the NYULH pediatric cardiac surgery progr am experience and Vizient inpati ent data for pediatri c heart transplant and LVAD cases. Expense assumptions are based on the calculation of staffing e xpenses using specialized-specific full-time equivalents per transplant rates, which are made avai lable annually by the United Network for Organ Sharing Staffing sur vey. Staff benefits were based o n a fringe rate of 39.6% and supply and purchased services expenses were based on the experience of NYULH adult heart transplant and Left Ventricular Assist Device programs. Project #192008-C Exhibit Page 15 Utilization assumptions are bas ed on the actual NYULH heart pr ogram rates by payor for each of these types of encou nters. The payor mix for pediatric heart tr ansplants performed in New York in calendar years 2017 and 2018 was 57 % Medicaid, CHIP, or Self-pa y. In Year One, the estimates included one transplant, one LVAD implant, and in Year Three, a s volume increases, the payor mix was adjusted to be more reflectiv e of the New York historical a ctual. Utilization broken down by payor source for inpatient and outp atient services is as follows: Inpatien t Medicaid MC 100% 42% Medicaid MC 100% 58% Capability and Feasibility There are no issues o f capability since there is no total proje ct cost associated with this application. The submitted budget projects an exce ss of revenues over expenses o f $30,388 and $1,144,653 for the first and third years, respectively . Medicaid Managed Care is reflec ted in first year revenue due to the following: As per the Medicare Hospital Conditions of Participation: Requ irements for Approval and Re- Approval of Transplant Centers to perform Organ Transplants, an adult transplant program is permitted to perform pediatric tr ansplants under its Medicare a pproval. A center that is requesting init ial Medicare approval to perfo rm pediatric transplant is not required to comply with the clinical exper ience requirements. Therefore, t here is no minimum volume, or additional Medicare certificati on requirement for NYULH to perf orm Medicare-approved pediatric heart transplants. The first-year incremental r evenue estimated includes one pedi atric heart transplant, one pediatric LVAD implantation, and the pre- and post-transplant and LVAD ad missions provided to patients who are evaluated for transplantati on as well as the patient who is transplanted. The applicant estimates that t he payor for such cases will be Medicaid based on the historical payor mix for pediatric heart tr ansplants in New York. The submitted budget appears reasonable. BFA Attachment A is the Augus t 31, 2018 and the August 31, 2019 certified financial statements of NYU Langone Hospitals. As shown, the entity had an average positiv e working capital position and an average positive net asset pos ition.

[AER] Council Action Date July 30, 2020 Project #182327-B Exhibit Page 4 Need Analysis Project Description 23Rd Street SC, LLC d/b/a Hudson Surgery Center is seeking approval to establish and construct a multi- specialty freestanding ambulatory surgery center (FASC) and ini tially provide orthopedic and pain management services at 234-238 East 23rd Street, New York, 10010 , in New York County. Analysis The service area consists of New York County. The population of New York County in 2010 was 1,585,873 with 595,344 individual s (37.5%) who are 45 and over, which are the primary population group utilizing ambulatory surgery ser vices. Per PAD projection data, this population group (45 and over) is estimated to grow to 703,766 by 2025 and represent 41.2% of the projected population of 1,709,958. Currently, 50% of the procedures m oving to the proposed surgery center are being performed in other ambulatory surgery centers, 47% a re being performed in an offic e-based setting and the remaining 3% are being performed in hospita ls. The applicant projects 4,622 procedures in Year One and 11,556 in Year Three. The table below shows the projected payor source ut ilization for Year s One and Three. Payor Year One Year Three Volume % Volume % Medicaid FFS 432 9.35% 1,040 9.00% Medicaid 100.0% 11,556 100.0% The Center initially plans to obtain contracts with the followi ng Medicaid Managed care plans: Fidelis, Health First, Metroplus and Unit ed Healthcare Community Plan. T he Center plans to contact staff at Mount Sinai Medical Center to dis cuss a collaborative relations hip to meet the needs of the under-served population.

Dr. Gerling disclosed two pending malpractice cases. One alleged inaccura te consent and the action is in the early stages of discovery . There is a scheduling confere nce set for December 2019. At this time the parties will determine whether the case is ready to proceed to jury selection for the commencement of trial. The other all eged a post-operative complication. It is a lleged that Dr. Gerling improperly performed a laminectomy. The Court recently denied a summary judgement moti on on the ground that there were issues of fact for the jury to dec ide, with respect to whether the dural tear is a risk of the procedure or whether the dural tear could hav e caused the injuries claimed. The case is pending. Mr. Stackhouse disclosed two pending legal matters regarding entities with wh ich he is affiliated. In the first matter, he reported tha t Mt. Sinai's legal department bel ieves that Beth Israel Ambulatory Care Services Corp. (now known as Mount Sinai Ambulatory Ventures, I nc.) was named erroneously and they are seeking to have the corpor ation removed from the suit. Ther e has been no movement on the case for thee last three years and it has been req uested that the case b e dismissed on stipulation. They are waiting to hear from the plaint iff's lawyer on the request. In the second matter, Mr. Stackhouse disclosed that he represents NYEE Holding Corp. on the board of Empire Su rgery Center. In 2017, a malpractice suit was filed against Empire Su rgery Center of which NYEE Hold ing Corp. is a 30% member. Additionally, the staff from the Division of Certification & Su rveillance reviewed the ten-year surveillance history of all associ ated facilities. Sources of information in cluded the files, records, and reports found in the Department of Health. Included in the review were the resul ts of any incident and/or complaint investigations, independent professional reviews, and/or compre hensive/focused inspections. The review found that any citations were pr operly corrected with appropria te remedial action. Integration with Community Resources For those patients who do not ident ify a primary care provider, the Applicant will work with Mt. Sinai, its equity partner, to identify possibl e providers. The Applicant is committed to serving all persons in need of services without discrimination based on personal characteristi cs or ability to pay. A financial assistance policy and sliding fee schedule will be availabl e. Numerous to ols such as brochures, news releases, radio interviews, e-mails, dir ect mailings, posters, billboards , presentations, workshops, and participation in community health fairs will be employed to reach community m embers and businesses to raise awareness about the services offe red and the relationship with the local hospital. In addition, the center will place emphasis on providing c ulturally-sensitive services and improving access for traditionally underserved populations including ethnic minorities and persons of low-income status. Project #182327-B Exhibit Page 7 The center intends on using an el ectronic medical record (EMR) and plans on working with Mt. Sinai to establish a mutual relationship and future integration into the Regional Health Information Organization (RHIO) and/or Health Informati on Exchange (HIE). In addition, Dr. Reyfman's existing practice currently has contracts with several Medicaid Managed Care Plans which he will pursue for th is center post- approval.

The reimbursement rates were det ermined based on the Centers f or Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) rate schedule received fr om the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association (ASCA). Additionally, an analysis of the Cu rrent Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for each specialty along with guidance from Mt. Sinai Am bulatory Ventures, Inc. was the basis for the revenue projections. The applicant states the average facility fee reimbursement for the proposed specialties are as follows: Pain Cases $419.50 and Ortho-Spi ne Cases $1,050.00. T he reimbursement rates only contemplate the facility fee as the surgeon will bill (charge) their professional fee separately as allowed. In computing revenue, t he applicant did not consider the factors such as cases that involve multiple procedures or incorporat e anesthesiologist services wh ich can be negotiated for a higher fee for reimbursement. Medicaid and Medicare managed care rates are based upon CMS fe e schedule for the mix of procedures to be performed at the Center. The rates only includ e the facility fee. The Commercial fee for service rate is based on two times the proposed CMS fee schedule rate (a typical commercial payor rate) . The Commercial managed care ra te is based on one and half times of the proposed CMS fee schedule. Per the FY 2021 Enacted State B udget and effective April 2, 20 20, Medicaid payments are being reduced by 1.5% acro ss the board. This redu ction has been refl ected within the budgets. Expense assumptions are based up on similar size and type of am bulatory surgery c enters as well as the experience of a proposed member in operating ASC. Rent inc ludes the value of the tenant improvements as they are being performed by the landlord. Utilization assumptions are su pported by volume letters from t he participating physi cians who will be utilizing the center based on t heir current experience.

General Coun \u00b7 March 3, 2020 Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of Phelps Community Corporation The Phelps Community Corporation (PCC) was created to carry out activities exclusively for the benefit of the Phelps Memorial Hospital Association (PMHA) in North Terrytown New York. PCC is categorized as a supporting organization under\u00a7 509(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Following the recent acquisition of the Phelps Memorial Center of PMHA by Northwell Health, PCC seeks to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to pivot the scope of th,e organization to its surrounding communities. The proposed amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation are comprised of an update to the description of the organization to specify which entities the organization may make grants to and clarify the geographic areas served by the organization. Specifically, PCC desires to carry on activities to serve the health care needs and/or promote the wellness of, residents of Westchester and Rockland counties and not serve exclusively for the benefit of PMHA. PCC wishes to continue to solicit contributions for their communities, including organizations which fall under New York Public Health Law (PHL) articles 28, 36 and 44, as detailed in PHL \u00a7 2801-a(6). The proposed amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation necessitate the Public Health and Health Planning Council's (PHHPC's) consent to file with the New York State Department of State. Therefore, PHHPC's approval and consent is sought in the filing of the Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation of PCC. The document has been reviewed. There is no legal objection to the proposed Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation of PCC, and it is in legally acceptable form.
