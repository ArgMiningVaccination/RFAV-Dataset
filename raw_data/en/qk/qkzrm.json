Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 2 of 26 I. Introduction In 1993, Family Support Legislation was passed that defined a family support program for people with developmental disabilities and their families, subject to funding appropriations. This legislation was in partnership with families, advocacy organizations, service providers and the Division of Developmental Disabilities (Division or DDD) who all recognized the importance of family support as a national initiative. The Division integrates the idea of this legislation into all its programs and activities. This Annual Report highlights the initiatives and systems that have been successfully implemented and describes the ways members and families are supported through the Division and its many partners . Family support is defined as services, supports and other assistance offered to families with members who have a developmental disability and are designed to: Strengthen the family's role as a primary caregiver; Maintain family unity ; Reunite families with members who have been p laced out of the home; Include respite care, assistive technology, appropriate personal assistance services, parent training and counseling, home modifications, and assistance with extraordinary expenses associated with the needs of a person with a developmental disability ; and Prevent inappropriate out-of- home placement . II. Overview of the Division of Developmental Disabilities A s of June 30, 2019, the Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities provides services and programs to 42,806 people with developmental disabilities. The Division believes its members can best be supported in integrated community settings and tailors its services to meet the needs of members and their families. The Division promotes the use of existing community resources and program flexibility and coordinates services and resources through central administrative offices, District offic es and local offices located throughout Arizona . There are five (5) geographic DDD Districts within the state. They include District Central, District East, District North, District South and District West. While some services are delivered directly by the state, most services and supports are delivered through a network of individual and agency providers throughout Arizona.

The following chart shows the breakd own of eligible memb ers by primary disability as of June 30, 2019: Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 4 of 26 The Division supports people of all ages. The following chart shows the breakdown of eligible members by age as of June 30, 2019: The Division provides services through two primary funding sources: State general fund s Medicaid The Division provides services to three eligibility categories or populations: (1) State-only funded members (2) Targeted Support Coordination (TSC) members (3) Arizona Long T erm Care System (ALTCS) members Individuals who meet the Division's eligibility criteria , receive s tate-funded services and are not- to-exceed the Division's legislative budget allowance. Children under the age of three (3) receive state-funded services outlined through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) Part C requirements. The types of s tate-funded services provided are listed in Section III of this report. Targeted Support Coordination (TSC) is an option for people who qualify for services through the Division and are eligible for Medicaid acute care through Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System ( AHCCCS ) but are not eligible for ALTCS. AHCCCS is the Medicaid agency for Arizona. AHCCCS decides if a member is qualified for the TSC program. This option allows the member /responsible person to determine the frequency and type of contact he/she wants from the Division's Support Coordinator (case manager). TSC provides support to a member by helping identify community resources and coordinate acute care services provided Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 5 of 26 by Medicaid. These members may also receive state-funded services not to exceed the Division's legislative budget appropriation. For persons age 21 and under, Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) services are covered. Individuals with developmental disabilities who qualify for services through the Division may also be eligible for services through ALTCS . ALTCS provides long- term care services , behavioral health services , and acute care services to individuals with developmental disabilities who are at risk of institutionalization. AHCCCS staff determines eligibility f or ALTCS through a review of the person's functional needs and financial eligibility. In Arizona, the Medicaid program is a re search and demonstration wai ver approved through the Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS ). It is intended to show that home and community- based services and a managed c are app roach are m ore cost -effective than placing members in institution s. Long- term care, behavioral health and acute care services are bundled to improve care coordination and enhance service delivery under a single system managed by the Division. The following chart shows the break down of eligible members by funding source as of June 30, 2019: The D ivision provides most of its services through a statewide network of for-profit and non- profit agencies ( qualified vendors), in dependent providers and specialty contractors . Services are based on a member's assessed needs, state and/or federal guidelines and SourceArizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 6 of 26 III.

V. E mployment Options B ased on the Governor's Executive Order of November 2017 declaring Arizona an Employment First State, the Division adopted the Employment First philosophy and policy which includes the ADULT DEV HOME 3.10% CHILD DEV HOME 0.46% HOME 88.66%INSTITUTION 0.35% GROUP HOME 7.41%People Served by Residence*Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 9 of 26 belief that competitive, integrated employment should be the primary outcome for working age youth and adul ts with disabilities. Employment First Through Employment First, the Division, DES Rehabilitative Services Administration (RSA) , Arizona Department of Education, AHCCCS, Arizona Developmental Disabilities Planning Council (ADDP C), the University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD - Sonoran and Northern), a number of DDD qualified vendors, school districts, advocates and other stakeholders developed the Employment First Strategic Plan in 2015 to change employment services in Arizona for people who have disabilities. Recently , the Employment First stakehol ders partook in meetings and discussions where it was determined that System Transformation is the main focus for changing the Employment First Plan. Four categories were identified to form the basis for stakeholders to help fulfill the activities set to take place over the next year to move the plan forwar d: Messaging Training Community Engagement System Organization Employment Services T he Division's Employment Services Unit is made of nine Employment Service Specialists and a manager . They are responsible for giving help and information about the seven employment services offered by the Division to Support Coordinators, qualified vendors, the community , members and their families and /or caregivers. Three of these services : Group Supported Employment (GSE), Individual Supported Employment (ISE) and Employment Support Aid (ESA) are done in the community and give members the training and support they need to achieve or maintain successful employment. The total number of ALTCS eligible members between the ages of 18 and 65 is 16,376. The total number of ALTCS eligible members between the ages of 18 to 65 in integrated employment in the community is 2,619: Group Supported Employment 2,352 Individual Supported Employment 104 Employment Support Aid 163 The Division offers a variety of employment services: Individual Supported Employment : This se rvice provides Job Coaching and/or Job Se arch services for eligible Division members. Job Coaching is a time- limited service that provides regular contacts with the employed person and/or with their employer.

Job Search may be provided by DDD when the service is not available through the Division of Employment and Rehabilitation Services/Vocational Rehabilitation ( DERS/VR ). Employment Support Aide : This service provides people with the one- to-one supports needed for members to remain in their employment. The actual supports provided will depend on the person's need. I t is the Division's expectation that this service will primarily be used to provide on-the-job, follow-along supports for members in competitive employment. These supports could include one or more of the following three options: o Limited personal- care services o Behavioral supports o Follow-along supports Group-Supported Employment : This service provides members with an on- site supervised work environment in a community -based setting. Members are offered the chance to work in a setting that allows for maximum interaction with other co -workers or the community. Members are paid by a qualified vendor for work performed in accordance with state and federal laws. Center -Based Employment : This service is provided in a qualified vendor owned or operated setting where members partake in paid work and work- related activities w ith little or no interaction with the general community. The goal is to improve the skills, abilities and behaviors of members and encourage them to achieve their vocational goals. The qualified vendor pays members in accord with state and federal laws. Career Preparation and Readiness (CPR) : This new service helps members make progressive moves into integrated employment from Center-Based Employment. Integrated employment is defined as competitive employment and group supported employment. Each member participating in CPR will have an Individualized Training Agreement tailored to their individual needs. Services include readiness assessment, work incen tive outcomes, family and caregiver engagement and education, career exploration and trial work experience. Transition to Employment: This service is a curriculum -based service that offers a member with customized instruction, training and supports to promote skill development for integrated and competitive employment.

These efforts include participating with RSA/VR in a Supported Employment Pilot Program in Chandler to improve the number of DDD members referred to VR for competitive integrated employment . The pilot will also help streamline the referral process for members and their families and/or guardians. The number of DDD members referred to RSA/VR from September 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 for competitiv e integrated employment or to meet Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act requirements was 431 members. VI. Provider Network B usiness Operations The D ivision provides most of its services through a statewide network of for-profit and non- profit agencies ( qualified vendors) and independent providers. The Division contracts with agencies and professional providers through the qualified vendor application process. This is an electronic process that is open and continuous. In order to support choice, members /families have a variety of providers to choose from . Providers usually work for an agency, or (sometimes) a member may sel ect an independent provider if an agency provider is not available. Independent providers receive training and must be certified prior to providing the service. These independent providers are employees of the member or family and are paid through a fiscal intermediary. The fiscal intermediary for the Division is a Public Partnership Limited (PPL). Home and Community-Based Providers # of Contracts Agencies ( qualified vendors) 752 Independent Providers 945 VII. Services for Infants and Toddlers and their Families DES is the lead agency for Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Arizona Early Intervention Program (AzEIP) is a program within the DES Division of Developmental Disabilities serving infants and toddlers. AzEIP serves children birth to three (3) years of age with a significant developmental delay or who have an established condition that likely results in the child having a developmental delay. Children who are eligible for AzEIP may also be eligible for services through the Division and/or the Arizona Schools for the Deaf and Blind and ALTCS. Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 12 of 26 Using a Team -Based Early Intervention model, AzEIP ensures that all eligible families are provided with a Core Team of professionals (developmental special instructionists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language pathologists, social workers, and psychologists ) and a service coordinator who use natural learning opportunities, teaming, coaching, resource- based c apacity -building, and responsive caregiving practices. These efforts are collectively employed to help caregivers or families assist their infants and toddlers grow and develop by engaging and participating in everyday routines and activities. The family and team develop an Individualized Family Service Plan (ISFP) for each eligible child based on the concerns, priorities and resources of the family. Between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2019, AzEIP received 17,201* referrals and had active IFSP's for 11,896* children over the course of the fiscal year (including referrals for children in previous fiscal years). During the fiscal year, 5,665* children receiving services were considered AzEIP -only, 5,875* children were determined eligible for the Division, and 356* of these children also received services and supports through the Arizona Schools for the Deaf and Blind. *preliminary data, AzEIP data is not finalized and validated for FY 201 9 at the time of this rep ort. V III. Acute Care Health Plan Services ALTC S is unique because it follow s a managed -care model. A managed care approach proved to be cost -effective over many years in Arizona. It is also the first program of its kind to bundle acute and long-term care services under a single program contractor. The ALTCS guiding principles includes a member -centered approach. The member and family are the active participants in the planning and the evaluation of services provided. Effective October 1, 2019, the Division will contract with two health plans to provide physical and behavioral health services to DDD and ALTCS eligible members residing across every Arizo na county. The health plans allow each person who is enrolled a choice of a primary care provider. The Division's contracted health plans are: United Health Care Community Plan Mercy Care Plan The Division also collaborates with the AHCCCS American Indian Health Program (AIHP) for children and adults who are tribal members. Tribal members enrolled in the Division who are ALTCS eligible may select the DDD American Indian Health Plan as an alternate to the Mercy Care Plan or the United Health Care Community Plan. IX. Behavioral Health Services Since July 1, 2016, the Division entered into an Interagency Service Agreement (ISA) with AHCCCS. Through the ISA, AHCCCS assumed responsibility for the provision and oversight of all medically necessary covered behavioral health services to Division Medicaid and ALTCS eligible members. The Division is required to coordinate care for members receiving behavioral health services from AHCCCS' subcontractors. Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 13 of 26 AHCCCS subcontracts with three Regional Behavioral Health Authorities (RBHAs) for designated service areas of the state: Health Choice Integrated Care (Steward Health Choice), Mercy Maricopa Integrated Care (Mercy Care) and Cenpatico Integrated Care (Arizona Complete Health) and four Tribal Regional Behavioral Health Authorities (TRBHAs) that serve Arizona tribal members: Navajo Nation, Gila River Indian Community, White Mountain Apache Tribe and Pascua Yaqui Tribe. As part of its care management responsibilities, the Division collaborates with RB HAs, TRBHAs and Children's Rehabilitative Services (CRS) to resolve member complaints, barriers related to behavioral health service delivery, and identification of interventions to address the complex needs of members who require these services. These eff orts are accomplished through ongoing and established care collaboration efforts that include: Community Collaborative Care Teams ; Multidisciplinary member staffings ; Division and RBHA care collaboration meetings; Monthly \"round\" calls with CRS on mutual members ; High Need/ High -Cost program member staffings; Joint Protocol Meetings ; and Ongoing technical assistance efforts for members mutually served by the Division and the public behavioral health system. The most significant activity in the last year specific to behavioral health care was the Division's preparation for the October 1, 2019 Integrated Health Plan under the new DDD Health Plans . Managed Care Organizations (Mercy Care and United Health Care Co mmunity Plan) will be responsible for providing physical health care services, behavioral health services, CRS for eligible members, and limited Long-term Services and Supports in a more convenient and efficient manner . This integration allows for better coordination of services and makes the system easier for members and providers to navigate. X. Other Division Activities that Support Arizona's Families Providing services and supports to members and families is very important to the Division. In addition to the services and supports listed above, the following are some examples of how the Division serves as a leader for members and families: There are about 750 children who are DDD eligible and served by the Department of Child Safety (DCS). The two systems work collaboratively to ensure that children receive the services they qualify for. The Division has a designated DCS Liaison to facilitate effective working relationships with DCS field sections. This includes site visits to individual D CS field sections, presentations on DDD information, participation in joint workgroups and facilitation of inquiries from both the Division and DCS staff. The Division has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DERS /Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) to facilitate the referral of DDD foster children between the ages of 14 and 18 to VR Programs. The MOU calls for a dedicated VR Counselor and increased joint effo rts between the Division and VR. On a quarterly basis, the DCS Liaison Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 14 of 26 facilitates a meeting with DDD Employment Specialists, VR staff, and DDD field representatives to exchange referral data, reasons for non -referral and ways to improve the referral process for foster youth. Invited stakeholders share information on various employment related matters with the group with the goal of increasing awareness and increasin g referrals for youth who are appropriate for employment services. The Division has a designated Tribal Liaison who works with the DES Tribal Liaisons to facilitate effect ive working relationships with the 22 federally recognized Arizona tribes. This includes site visits to individual tribal nations, joint presentations, and facilitation of inquiries from both the Division and tribes. DDD staff participated in 86 tribal meetings and presenta tions with representatives of the tribe and tribal community members. The Division has 2,019 DDD members who identified themselves as American Indian/Alaskan Native. The DDD Tribal Liaison tracked tribal affiliation for the 22 Arizona tribes, as well as non -Arizona tribes, for accurate data to be shared with the tribes and for Division planning purposes. The Division has an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the Navajo Nation D ivision of Social Services to provide comprehensive case management for DDD ALTCS members that are residing on the Navajo Nation. The comprehensive case management duties are the same as a DDD Support Coordinator. The contracted unit served an average of 208 members per month during FY 2019. The Division has a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) and Master of Social Work (MSW) Internship Program with various universities which provides opportunities for social work students to gain practical field experience working with Division members. This collaboration with universities/colleges is an approved field placement for course credit. It is also an opportunity to expose students to members with developmental disabilities in the community and to help recruit potential new employees for the Division. The Division's Health Care Services continues to facilitate the AHCCCS High Need/High Cost (HNHC) program. This is done through the ongoing identification of members for the program. Program members' needs are staffed with the Division's subcontracted health plans, RBHAs, subcontracted behavioral health providers, and Children's Rehabilitative Services (CRS) representatives, when appropriate. The Division's Self -Determination and Self -Advocacy ( This Is MY Life ) contracts with Ability 360 and DIRECT to provide curriculum development and training to assist members in learning self-determination and self-advocacy values . Self-determination promotes learning decision-making skills to apply in everyday life. Project objectives include focusing on abilities, developing a self-determination community, member- controlled provider contracts, member budget control, promoting programs that support inclusion, and improving operating efficiencies within DDD. The Division supports councils and family groups. Family groups are parent-driven and provide support and learning opportunities; and specialized groups for Autism, Down Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 15 of 26 Syndrome and groups for families who speak Spanish as their primary language. These groups are located throughout the state. Some of these include: o Developmental Disabilities Advisory Council ( DDAC ), a Governor-appointed council that is advisory to the Assistant Director o Independent Oversight Committees (form erly known as Human Rights Committees) o Program Review Committee s o Stakeholder Workgroups o State Operated Intermediate Care Facilities Governing Body o Arizona Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act Along with the Division's Community Engagement Coordinator, Employment Services Specialists participate in outreach presentations to m embers, parents, advocacy and community groups on DDD employment services. They also attend community events such as transition, job, and provider f airs, c areer expos and other events to answer questions and educate the public on employment services. The number of outreach presentations are included in the community engagement section of this report. T he Division collaborates with other state agencies and stakeholders, through participation in the Arizona Community of Practice on Transition, which meets monthly and is currently developing a Transition Guide for families . The Employment Specialists participate in local communities of practice involving school districts, providers of service, advocates and other state agencies to promote post -secondary transition for employment opportunities. Employment Service Specialists participated in two interagency workshops. One, entitled \"Oh Yes, I can Work \", addressed supported employment for people with significant disabilities seeking competitive employment. The second workshop, Competitive Integrated Employment (CIE), led by a national expert dealt with Customized Employment and identified strategies for encouraging hope and creating the expectation of integrated employment for people with disabilities. This past year, the Arizona Department of Education held numerous c ollabo ration workshops at school districts throughout the state to discuss best practices on collaboration with VR, DDD, Employment First, transition planning, vocational education and employment outcomes for special education students. Not only did the Division's Employment Services Specialists participate in the collaborative workshops in their Districts but often Support Coordinators also attended and participated. The Division Network Development Manager works with the qualified vendors and subcontracted h ealth plans to ensure members receive services from a workforce that is qualified, competent and sufficiently staffed in an interpersonally, clinically, culturally and technically effective manner. The Division has begun to develop an operational infrastruct ure for workforce policy management to implement, monitor and manage a Workforce Development Plan. Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 16 of 26 The Division is establishing resources, data collection and reporting to support the Workforce Development (WFD) needs of its contractors. The Division is also working with AHCCCS to develop a standardized set of metrics for measuring workforce stability to support and inform the development and implementation of the Division's Workforce Development Plan including av erage time to fill, turnover, and retention. The Division has a Policy Review Team (PRT) that meets monthly. The PRT is responsible for the annual policy review, approvals and clarifications. New policies or major policy revisions are shared with the DDAC for input and review. The Division provides updates to policy via an Opt -In list. Families, members, and community stakeholders submit their contact information to the DDD Policy Unit so that they can receive email updates when there are changes to p olicy. There are currently over 402 individuals on the Opt -In list. All new Support Coordinators complete over 120 hours of initial classroom training upon hire that teaches them the philosophy of the Division, how to recognize and report maltreatment, the critical components of person- centered planning and provides the foundation for further on-the-job training. The skills developed during the training are reflected in the interactions Support Coordinators have with members and families. All new State Operated Group Home staff complete over 8 0 hours of initial classroom training upon hire that teaches them the philosophy of the Division, how to recognize and report maltreatment and the critical components of respectful, appropriate active treatment and care. The Division operates Intermediate Care Facilities (ICFs) . Staff within these ICF settings also receive the same training. The Division completed purchase of a new step -down home . The step -down home is owned and operated by DDD and is designed to facilitate timely transition of dischar ge ready members from inpatient facilities back into the community. The program consists of two short- term community -based beds and intensive, on- site support services to assist in linking qualified members with appropriate long- term care services and sup ports. Critical to the process is the early involvement by specialists in developmental disabilities and mental health to create a member centered community re-integration plan. The Division's Office of Housing, Engagement, Resources, and Opportunity (HE RO) provides support to Independent Oversight Committees (IOCs) (formerly known as Human Rights Committees) organized within each District across the state. These committees are comprised of local volunteers who provide independent oversight in matters related to the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities such as incidents of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Committees usually meet once a month to: o Review incidents that may have involved neglect, abuse or denial of rights to members receiving services ; Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 17 of 26 o Review behavior programs which involve the use of behavior-modifying medications or aversive techniques; o Review proposed research involving members receiving services ; and o Make recommendations to DDD about proposed changes needed to protect the rights of members receiving services . The Division provides support to Program Review Committees (PRCs) across the state. These volunteer committees review proposed behavior plans to make sure the plan is properly written and includes positive strategies and does not violate individuals' rights. The Division's Quality Management System (QMS) includes the Incident Management System (IMS) which is the automated system for incident reporting. For all Quality of Care (QOC) concerns the D ivision utilizes the AHCCCS QMS Portal which is a confidential system for completing QOC investigations. The purpose of the AHCCCS QMS portal is to assist in the promotion of health, safety, and welfare of individuals with developmental disabilities throu gh active reporting, fact-finding, tracking, and trending of incidents, and the implementation of both individual- specific and systemic -corrective actions and prevention strategies. The Division's Quality Management Program Monitoring Unit conducts monitoring of group homes, center -based programs (Day and Employment), Home and Community Based Service and qualified vendors providing developmental home services for children and adults each year for compliance with programmatic standards. The Unit also completes audits of the Direct Care Worker training programs across the state. Credentialing team members gather information to support the Division's credentialing process of qualified vendors. DDD established a contract with United Health Care Community Plan to provide Children's Rehabilitative Services (CRS) to qualified DDD Long Term Care (LTC) members. The purpose of the contract was to ensure seamless coverage for members receiving services through CRS once the AHCCCS Complete Care health plans went into effect on October 1, 2018. This contract was to cover the \"gap\" year until new DDD Health Plans will be implemented October 1, 2019. These new health plans will include CRS coverage for eligible members. In preparation for the implementation of the DDD Health Plans, DDD facilitated 18 statewide informational sessions on the AHCCCS Complete Care health plans and how the DDD LTC members will continue to have access to CRS. In addition, DDD met with the directors of each of the four CRS multi-specialty interdisciplinary clinics to provide education regarding this change and provide training on DDD. In February and March of 2019, DDD invited members and families to attend meetings for the purpose of identifying questions people may have regar ding the implementation of the new integrated DDD Health Plans effective October 1, 2019. These meetings were held in Chandler, Phoenix, Tucson and Flagstaff. The information gathered informed Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 18 of 26 DDD in order to develop Frequently Asked Question guides that are posted on the DDD website at : https://des.az.gov/services/disabilities/developmental- disabilities/new -ddd- health -plans . Be tween March 18, 2019 and May 30, 2019, DDD traveled 8,164 miles and held 60 in- person member, family and provider forums throughout the state and three forums conducted by WebEx. DDD par tnered with Raising Special Kids who facilitated the member and family forums. Raising Special Kids is a nonprofit organization that provides support and information for parents of children with disabilities and special health care needs. Northern Arizona University, Institute for Human Development facilitated th e provider forums. There were 526 participants at the member and family forums and 252 attended the provider forums. The purpose of these forums was to obtain community input on what is going well with DDD Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS), what needs to be improved, solutions for improvement, thoughts on an alternate service delivery model, and thoughts on Governor Ducey's Executive Order Relating to Enhanced Protect ions for Individuals with Disabilities . Raising Special Kids and Northern Arizona University conducted an analysis of the responses and provided written reports. These reports can be found on the DDD Website at: https://des.az.gov/services/disabilities/developmental- disabilities . DDD, i n partnership with the Office of Community Engagement, continues to present to the First Responder community. Presentations on DDD are intended to help First Responders understand approaches to working with individuals with developmental or intellectua l disabilities. Audiences include law enforcement, firefighters , 911 dispatchers, hospital personnel and a variety of other first responders. We continue to use ten (10) videos in these presentations so those in remote areas can receive important tools fo r working with individuals with developmental disabilities. Also, the Developmental Disability Safety Coalition, which started at the end of FY 2018, is going strong. The Safety Coalition is a committee of stakeholders , including first responders, whose mission is to promote collaboration between individuals, families and community partners that promote safe and successful outcomes, increase awareness and improve community interactions. In partnership with the Office of Community Engagement, a single sta ff person within the Customer Service Center is the main contact person for all first responders. The Medallion Program continues to provide members safety and protection during emergencies. The identification band or tag has the members' DDD \"case number\" and a 24-hour D DD Hotline number. First Responders will call the Hotline number during an emergency and DDD will give information to help the member. These identification bands or tags are provided at no cost to the member. DDD p articipated in eight (8) DES forums along with other DES Divisions. Four (4) of the forums were held in the Fall of 2018 and the remaining forums were held during the Spring of 2019. These forums were an opportunity for local community services leaders to join in on a conversation with DES leadership to strengthen the efforts of our shared Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 19 of 26 mission to serve Arizonans in need. DES Divisions shared updated information about their programs and provided an opportunity for the public to ask questions. Activities of the Office of Administrative Review, which oversees all of the Division'sfunctions involving appeals, claim disputes, administrative reviews, and hearings, are also reviewed for trends and areas for improvement. The Division continues to participate in the N ational Core Indicator (NCI) Project, a voluntary effort by state developmental disability agencies to track their performanceusing a standardized set of member and family/guardian surveys with nationally validatedmeasures. The effort is coordinated by the National Association of State Directors ofDevelopmental Disabilities Services (NASDDDS) and the Human Services ResearchInstitute (HSRI). NCI has developed more than 100 standard performance measures thatthe states use to assess the outcomes of services for members and families, includingoutcomes in the areas of employment, rights, service planning, community inclusion,choice, health, and safety. Results of these measurements can be compared from state to state and from year to year. The Division consistently tracks its performance and, eachyear identifies areas of strength and need. The information is then shared throughout the DDD sy stem. Utilizing the NCI data, the Division's existing Committees, Workgroups and Management Team identify priority areas and develops and implementsimprovement strategies. Progress can then be evaluated on subsequent survey cycles.Specific surveys include the Adult In-Person Survey, which is conducted during a face toface conversation with the member and a third-party interviewer and three family -related surveys conducted by mail, one each for adults and children living in the family home,and a third for adults residing outside the family home. The selection of members andtheir families to participate in the surveys are random. Survey results are from the previous year so the results from 2018 will be availablebetween November 2019- January 2020. Survey studies are to assess services . The following table shows current performance measures and progress from 2015 and 2017: In-Person Survey (Adult Questions Consumer Survey) Year 2015 Year 2017 Percent of Improvement Do you take classes/training to get job/better job? 12.00% 21.20% 9.2% Increase Did planning meeting you wanted to be there? 89.00% 94.15% 5.1% Increase Were you able to choose services that you get as part of your plan? 64.00% 76.00% 12.0% Increase Have staff who treat you with respect? 95.00% 95.50% their inator? 86.00% 89.60% 3.6% Increase Additionally, to improve the quality and stability of the workforce of Direct SupportProfessionals (DSPs) who assist adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities,the Division also participates in the Staff Stability Survey.

A Snapshot of FY19 Accomplishments To suppor t members and their families, the Division engages in continuous improvement opportunities and actively collaborates with its community partners and stakeholders. Some examples include: The Division amended two rules in FY 2019. Article 3, Eligibility for Developmental Disabilities Services was finalized August 24, 2018. Article 5, formerly Admission/Redetermination/Termination was repealed with some sections added to Article 3. The purpose of the rulemaking was to add, amend, and repeal rules to conform to current practices and to make the rules more clear, concise, and understandable. The Division contracted with Relias Learning to provide online courses to all employees for the purpose of increasing their knowledge and awareness of cultural competency, person centered thinking, supporting members with complex healthcare needs and dual diagnoses. The Division completed their pilot project at the Central Maricopa County Office (Cholla) which led to improvements in the processes for engaging families in the ISP process. An update to the ISP resulted from this pilot. Staff developed job aids and a flow board to track the process at the Support Coordinator level. The Division is now progressively moving the new ISP and the associated process out to other offices across the state. The revised ISP and associated process results in more deeply integrating the members' and the families' voices and direction into the overall planning process. Additionally, it ensures one form is used statewide, while the actual ISPs are Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 21 of 26 individualized. The rollout of the process throughout DDD Support Coordination is currently projected to be complete by December 2019. The Division participates in the AHCCCS Justice Reach -In Initiative, which is specific to adult ALTCS eligible members, incarcerated 30 -days or longer.

The combined efforts of the Division, AHCCCS, Justice partners, RBHA and Acute Care partners provide integrated care coordination and re-entry assistance to our incarcerated population. The Home Modifications Unit received 389 requests for assessments to identify member needs to achieve greater independence in their homes and thereby improve their quality of life. Based on medical necessity, 182 home modifications were completed that could not be met using durable medical equipment. Forty- seven (47) assessments resulted in a referral to the member's acute care plan for durable medical equipment. The other 160 assessments resulted in closures for various reasons, such as member needs did not meet medical necessity for modifications or family opted out of Division recommended modifications. Specifically, the Home Modification Unit was able to serve the most vulnerable citizens of Arizona by assisting with the provision of 142 ramps for access into the home, 156 bathroom modifications to assist with hygiene and toileting, 116 door modifications for improving accessibility in the home, and 101 other types of modifications that helped increase member independence in their homes. The Home Modification Unit also monitored the projects to assist with any member or family concerns. In the past year, 1446 presentations and various types of events have been provided to sc hool districts, first responders, contracted providers, and community stakeholders, including health care providers, Department of Child Safety personnel, and tribal organizations.

In January, the Division sent out i ts first Member Monthly Update email to over 18,000 individual email addresses. This medium is used to communicate, educate and update members and families with important information about the Division as well as health related information. This monthly em ail has been used to share information on changes to ALTCS member health care services that take Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 22 of 26 affect October 1, 2019, as part of the DDD Health Plan rollout. In addition, the Division began working on updating mailed and marketing material, like brochures and pamphlets, to ensure accurate information was being disseminated to members. Through feedback obtained at community engagement meetings, Facebook was identified as a popular way that members of the DDD community receive and share information. In June of 2019, the Division launched a Facebook page specific to DDD that provides weekly information to members and families regarding relevant topics and events. The DDD Provider Publication Specialist position transitioned to the Customer Service Center and developed revised work plans, work processes, standard work and a tracking spreadsheet. In June of 2019, the Specialist audited the DDD Provider Search tool and discovered more than 100 revisions. These revisions included the removal of inactive websit es and other non-functioning website links and added additional agencies to the provider search tool. The DDD Provider Publication Specialist edited and wrote new sections for the DDD Resolution System Process and Grievance Standard Procedures. The DDD Pro vider Publication Specialist also trained six health care services transition coordinators in medical plan enrollment, changes during open enrollment, confirmation of the changes, and in telephone customer service. Through a Section 811 Project Rental Assistance program (PRA) grant, the Division collaborates with the Arizona Department of Housing (ADOH) and AHCCCS to secure affordable housing for members. The Section 811 PRA program enables individuals with disabilities who are income and ALTCS eligible to live in integrated, affordable housing. The 811 PRA grant allotted for 62 apartments throughout the state of Arizona. Fifty -five (55) of the sixty-two (62) apartments have been identified and are leased as vacancies occur. In a joint project with the Housing Authority of Maricopa County (HAMC), the Division was allotted 27 renovated apartments as part of affordable housing opportunities. This year, due to the success of the partnership, the Division has been allotted three additional apartments for a total of 30. Four members made a progressive move, three members moved from an Adult Developmental Home (ADH) into their own apartments, and one member who was homeless moved into his own apartment. The Division provided a letter of support for the HAMC to apply for mainstream vouchers which enable families to lease affordable private housing of their choice. The HAMC was awarded 45 vouchers in March of 2019 and gave Division members preference for 11 of them. Support Coordination referred over 92 members to the DDD Affordable Housing waitlist. An additional 23 members were referred to the mainstream voucher waitlist. The HERO unit assisted 38 households move into affordable housing and seven households move out.Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 23 of 26 The DDD Tribal Liaison assisted in resolv ing 198 member -related complaints and general inquires for tribal members.

In February of 2019, DDD Eligibility instituted a refined determination process that streamlined the application process, reduced the amount of time in making eligibility decisions an d reduced caseloads sizes. Using the principles of the Arizona Management System, the Division's eligibility units reduced the number of days to determine eligibility to less than 30 days by implementing standard work for the init ial eligibility process . For current DDD members, eligibility implemented a new redetermination process to ensure members go through a timely redetermination process across the state. This effort also included additional touchpoints with families to help them understand the redetermination process. The Division's Customer Service Center (CSC) developed a pilot program with the intent to reduce the average days to close members grievances in FY 2017. After the successful results of the pilot program, the CSC implemented the pilot to transition all CSC Representatives to Specialists in FY 2018. The average days to close member grievances in FY 2018 was at 40 days and after the implementation of the pilot program, it has reduced to 25 days in FY 2019. From October 2018, the CSC has improved telephone performance standards to ensure all incoming calls from the toll-free number to the CSC unit are answered promptly. Calls should be answered in less than 45 seconds which is the standard per AHCCCS. The CSC has exceeded expectations by answering incoming calls with an average of 24 seconds from October 2018 to June 2019. The CSC created a standard for measuring calls answered when it first rings to provide prompt service for callers. When this standard was created, the rate of calls answered by the first ring was at 72 percent in June 2018 and increased to 98 percent in October 2018. The rate stayed above 98 percent for the remainder of FY 2019. In June 2019, the CSC made improvements to the Resolution System in FOCUS to track Behavior Health grievances , specifically grievances for members diagnosed with Serious Mental Illness, and added other categories for grievance tracking . The Division, along with its community partners, sponsored the Fi fteenth Annual Direct Support Professional Awards Ceremony and Luncheon event on September 28, 2018, at the Ability360 Center. These outstanding individuals were honored for their superior service in working with individuals with developmental disabilitie s. There were twelve awardees which included ten Direct Support Professionals and two Direct Support Supervisors. AzEIP was monitored by the US Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP ) through a Differentiated Monitoring Syst em (DMS) . This is to Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 25 of 26 establish a Results Driven Accountability approach to monitoring and defining t he level of engagement from federal project officers for each state. They look at four areas and provide a tiered scoring in each area. Arizona continues to improve in all areas and this year's DMS designation is Meets Requirements, the highest designation: o Results o Fiscal o Compliance o State Systemic Improvement Plan ( SSIP) XII. C onclusion The Di vision is proud to continue to be a national leader for providing services to members and families in their home and community. The Division strives to provide flexible, quality, member- driven services and supports. Over 90 percent of the more than 40,000 individuals enrolled with DDD live in their own homes and communities rather than in institutional settings. DDD once again was ranked as the number one state in the nation by United Cerebral Palsy, The Case for Inclusion 2019. Additionally, the Division is committed to empowering Arizonans with Intellectual a nd Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) to lead self -directed, healthy, and meaningful lives. For DDD members who are also ALTCS eligible, the Division provides health care. DDD spent the last several months preparing for the transition of new DDD Health P lans for DDD/ALTCS members. These DDD Health Plan s will of fer eligible members physical and behavioral health services, Children's Rehabilitative Services (CRS) and limited Long-T erm Services and Supports (LTSS) including: Nursing facilities ; Emergency alert system services ; and Habilitative physical ther apy for m embers age twenty -one (21) and over. All other LTSS and Support Coordination will be provided by DDD. This model will have better health outcomes because physical and behavior health are under one health plan. This approach will also enhance care treatment between providers and improve member health. Preparing for this October 1, 2019 transition has been a huge task for the Division. There were 25 teams who developed project plans that outlined the work needed to be done for a successful transition . Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Developmental Disabilities Family Support Annual Report, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 Page 26 of 26 Some of the teams included: Business Operations; Support Services Administration; Communication, Contractor Readiness; Member Transition ; Training; and Member, Family, and Provider Education Forums. These teams held weekly planning meetings with internal and external partners with the goal of ensuring the impacted members experienced a smooth transition and continuity of care. This would not have been possible without this great teamwork and d edication across the Division. "}
