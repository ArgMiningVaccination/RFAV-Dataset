It can deliver, with ve ry high accuracy, substantially higher doses per treatment than those given in conventional fractionation while minimizing radiation exposure to adjacent normal tissue ( Chao et al., 2020). Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a non -surgical radiation therap y that is used to deliver a large dose of radiation with a high degree of precision and spatial accuracy, which can aid in preserving healthy tissue. SRS may be used to treat a variety of benign and malignant disorders involving intracranial structures, as well as select extracranial lesions (American College of Radiology ( al. (2021) performed a systematic review and meta -analysis to assess outcomes of irradiation for large vestibular schwannomas (VS). Rate of tumor control, serviceable hearing, need for salvage surgery, trigeminal nerve and facial nerve impairment, presence of vertigo/dizziness, and hydrocephalus requiring shunting were the primary endpoints. Three categories of studies were identified: 1) single- dose SRS (13 studies, 483 patients), 2) combination of microsurgery and SRS (7 studies, 182 patients), an d 3) fractionated SRS (3 studies, 82 patients). Tumor control was achieved in 89%, 94%, and 91% of patients, respectively. Odds ratios of over pretreatment serviceable hearing were 0.42, 0.47, and 0.60; for facial nerve impairment, these odds ratios w ere 1.08 , 3.45, and 0.87, respectively . The authors note that given the high likelihood of local structure compromise, tendency to continue growing in size, and difficulties associated with both microsurgery and SRS, large VS pose a therapeutic challenge. The authors concluded that SRS, either as a single dose, in conjunction with microsurgery , or fractionated provides good tumor control with acceptable cranial nerve morbidity and is a valid treatment alternative. Limitations include lack of RCTs included in the study, data was reported in a heterogenous manner, and limited study sizes. Further structured studies are recommended by the authors. Windisch et al. (2019) conducted a single -center, retrospective, case series analysis to evaluate clinical outcom es of patients with VS and treated with SRS. Clinical data and imaging follow- up were obtained from the center's database. Outcomes included local tumor control, hearing loss, and adverse events. Tumor response was assessed by MRI. Shrinkage and no change in size were scored as a locally controlled disease. Increased size in two consecutive follow -ups was interpreted as a local recurrence. Follow -up assessments were performed after six months, every year for two years, and every two years thereafter. A tota l of 996 patients with 1,002 tumors with at least one year of follow -up after SRS and were included for analysis. The median age at SRS was 55.1 years (range, 15.1 to 85.2 years) and the median follow -up was 3.6 years ( to 12.5 years). All tumors were trea ted in a single fraction, with a median prescription dose of 13 Gy (range, 11.5 to 15 Gy). The three, five, and 10 - year Kaplan -Meier estimated local tumor control was 96.6%, 92.3%, and 90.8%, respectively. The median hearing loss of the affected ear as com pared to its healthy counterpart was 17 dB at treatment start and increased to 23 and 29 dB at one and five years. Six patients (0.6%) developed symptomatic hydrocephalus and underwent the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. In 30 patients (3.0%), trigeminal sensory dysfunction developed, five patients (0.5%) had a mild transient weakness, and nine patients (0.9%) had a permanent facial weakness (House -Brackmann Grade > II) after SRS. The authors concluded that single Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 5 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. fraction SRS is highly effective and shows low treatment -related toxicity for VS, and that SRS should be considered a primary treatment option for small and middle -sized VS. Boari et al. (2014) conducted single -center case series analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in patients treated for VS. Patients who underwent GKRS as the primary treatment and had at least 36 months of clinical follow -up after GKRS were included in the analysis. Patients affected by bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) were excluded. Outcomes included tumor control, hearing preservation, and complications after SRS. A total of 379 patients underwent GKRS as the primary treatment and had clinical follow -up of at least 36 months (mean and median 75.7 and 69.5 month s, respectively). The patients' ages ranged from 23 to 85 years (mean 59 years). The mean tumor volume was 1.94 \u00b12.2 cm3 (median 1.2 cm3, range 0.013 to 14.3 cm3), and the median margin dose was 13 Gy (range, 11 to 15 Gy). Audiometric and quantitative radi ological follow -up examinations were obtained for 153 and 219 patients, Tumor control with GKRS was achieved in 97.1% of the patients. In 82.7% of the patients, the tumor volume had decreased at the last follow -up, with a mean relative reduction of 34.1%. The rate of complications was very low, with most consisting of a transient worsening of preexisting symptoms. Patients who had vertigo, balance disorders, or facial or trigeminal impairment usually experienced a complete or a t least significant symptom re lief after treatment. However, no significant improvement was observed in patients previously reporting tinnitus. The overall rate of preservation of functional hearing at the long -term follow -up was 49%; in patients with hearing classified as Gardner -Robe rtson (GR) Class I, this value was 71% and reached 93% among cases of GR Class I hearing in patients younger than 55 years. The authors concluded that GKRS is a safe and effective treatment for VS, achieving tumor control in 97.1% of cases and resulting in a very low morbidity rate. In addition, younger GR Class I patients had a significantly higher probability of retaining functional hearing even at the 10 -year follow -up; for this reason, the time between symptom onset, diagnosis, and treatment should be s hortened to achieve better outcomes in functional hearing preservation. Hasegawa et al. (2013) conducted a case series analysis to confirm whether Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for VSs continues to be safe and effective more than 10 years after treatment. A t otal of 440 patients with VS (including NF 2) were treated with GKS and of these, 347 patients (79%) underwent GKS as an initial treatment and 93 (21%) had undergone prior resection. Three hundred fifty -eight patients (81%) had a solid tumor and 82 (19%) had a cystic tumor. The median tumor volume was 2.8 cm3 and the median marginal dose was 12.8 Gy. The median follow -up period was 12.5 years. The actuarial 5 - and 10 -year progression -free survival (PFS) was 93% and 92%, respectively. None of the pa tients developed treatment failure more than 10 years after treatment. According to multivariate analysis, significant factors related to worse PFS included brainstem compression with a deviation of the fourth ventricle (p < 0.0001), marginal dose 13 Gy (p = 0.01), prior treatment (p = 0.02), and female sex (p = 0.02). Of 287 patients treated at a recent optimum dose of 13 Gy, three (1%) developed facial palsy, including two with transient palsy and one with persistent palsy after a second GKS, and thre e (1%) developed facial numbness, including two with transient and one with persistent facial numbness. The actuarial 10 -year facial nerve preservation rate was 97% in the high marginal dose group (> 13 Gy) and 100% in the low marginal dose group ( 13 Gy) . Ten patients (2.3%) developed delayed cyst formation. One patient alone developed malignant transformation, indicating an incidence of 0.3%. The authors concluded that GKS is a safe and effective treatment for the majority of patients followed more than 10 years after treatment. Special attention should be paid to cyst formation and malignant transformation as late adverse radiation effects (AREs) , although those appeared to be rare. However, additional long -term follow -up data is needed before making con clusions about the long -term safety and efficacy of GKS, particularly for young patients with VSs. Brain Metastasis Fogarty et al. (2019) conducted a multi -center, international, phase III, randomized trial (NCT01503827) to compare whole brain radiation t herapy (WBRT) with observation (Obs) after local treatment of one to three melanoma brain metastases (MBMs). The primary endpoint was distant intracranial failure within 12 months of randomization. The a priori neurocognitive function (NCF) endpoint was Ho pkins Verbal Learning Test -Revised (HVLT -R) delayed recall at four months. Secondary endpoints included local failure ( LF), overall survival ( OS) and global quality of life (QOL). Analyses were conducted on an intention -to-treat basis with nominal two -sided significance level 5%. Drug therapy was allowed. Effective drugs became available during trial and their impact was analyzed. A total of 215 patients consented to participate in the study and of those, eight withdrew or had no data collected. One hundred patients were randomized to the WBRT arm and 107 patients to the Obs arm. The mean age was 62 years, 67% males, 61% with single MBM of mean size two centimeters, and 67% had extracranial disease at randomization. NCF was completed by patients who spoke En glish; 50 patients who were randomized to WBRT and 70 patients to Obs at baseline, declining to 26 and 35 patients respectively at four months. Within 12 months, 54 (50.5%) patients in the Obs arm had distant intracranial failure compared with 42 (42.0%) p atients in the WBRT arm (OR 0.71; 95% interval [ CI] 0.41 to 1.23; p = 0.222). There was no difference in LF (p = 0.100) or OS (p=0.861). At 12 months, 53% of patients in the Obs arm and 59% of patients in the WBRT arm were alive. There was no difference in the mean intervention effect on global QOL (p = 0.083) Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 6 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. between the two arms. Patients who received T -cell checkpoint inhibitors and/or mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitors and WBRT before or within 12 months of randomiza tion had a distant intracranial failure rate 29% compared with 44% of patients in the Obs arm with no systemic therapy however, this difference was not significant (p = 0.228). The Obs arm had greater relative improvement from baseline in HVLT -R at every t imepoint. At four months, the Obs arm had a 20.9% improvement from baseline in HVLT -R-delayed recall compared with 2.7% decline in the WBRT arm; the overall adjusted average intervention effect was 23.6% (95% CI 9.0 to 38.2; p = 0.0018). There was no diffe rence in time to cognitive failure or in proportions with global cognitive impairment between the arms. The authors concluded that this randomized controlled trial shows that WBRT does not improve outcomes in MBMs, and that this trial justifies the recent move away from WBRT. Yamamoto et al. (2019) conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with brain metastasis who underwent multiple SRS procedures to validate whether brain metastasis velocity (BMV), a prognostic grading system, is generally ap plicable. The BMV score is the cumulative number of new brain metastases (BMs) that developed after the first SRS divided by time (years) since the initial SRS. Patients are categorized into three classes based on their BMV scores (i.e., 3, 4 to 13, and 14). A total 833 patients who underwent a second SRS procedure for newly detected BMs were included in the analysis. Of those, 250 underwent a third procedure, and 88 had a fourth SRS procedure. The median survival times (MSTs) after the second SRS were 12.9 months (95% CI, 10.2 to 17.1) for the BMV group with a score of 3; 7.5 months (95% CI, 6.5 to 9.0) for the group scoring four to 13, and 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 5.6) for the group scoring 14 (p = 0.0001). The corresponding MSTs after the third SRS were 13.2 months (95% CI, 9.1 to 21.6), 8.0 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 11.2), and 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.8 to 7.8; p =0.0001). Respective MSTs after the fourth SRS were 13.2 months (95% CI, 9.1 to 21.6), 8.0 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 11.2), and 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.8 to 7.8; p < 0.0001). The mean BMV score of patients with small cell lung cancer, 24.8, was significantly higher than that of patients with non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) , 17.7 (p = 0.032). The authors concluded that the results of this analysi s support the validity of BMV for predicting survival not only after the second SRS but also after the third and fourth SRS. Yamamoto et al. (2017) published a follow -up study to the JLGK0901 Study (Yamamoto 2014) to confirm the long -term safety of SRS in patients with five to 10 BMs. Yamamoto et al. (2014) was a multi -center, non- randomized observational study to examine whether SRS without WBRT as the initial treatment for patients with five to 10 BMs is non -inferior to that for patients with two to four BMs in terms of OS. The study enrolled 1,194 patients and the median OS after stereotactic RS was 13.9 months (95% CI, 12.0 to 15.6) in 455 patients with one tumor, 10.8 months (9.4- 12.4) in 531 patients with two to four tumors, and 10.8 months (9.1-12.7) in 208 patients with five to ten tumors. OS did not differ between the patients with two to four tumors and those with five to 10. SRS -induced adverse events occurred in 101 (8%) patients; nine (2%) patients with one tumor had one or more grade 3-4 event compared with 13 (2%) patients with two to four tumors and six (3%) patients with five to 10 tumors. The proportion of patients who had one or more treatment -related adverse event of any grade did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients with multiple tumors. Four patients died, mainly of complications related to SRS (two with one tumor and one each in the other two groups). The authors concluded that SRS without WBRT in patients with five to 10 BMs is non -inferior to that in patients with two to four BMs, and that the minimal invasiveness of SRS and fewer side -effects tha n with WBRT, may make SRS a suitable alternative for patients with up to 10 BMs. The follow -up study (Yamamoto 2017) reappraised, after an additional two years of follow -up, whether Gamma Knife SRS alone for five to 10 BMs is safe in the long term, as co mpared with that for two to four BMs, and even that for one BM, as well as reported WBRT results. The focus of this study was mini -mental state examination (MMSE) results and complications. The 1,194 eligible patients were categorized into the following gr oups: group A, one tumor (n = 455); group B, two to four tumors (n = 531); and group C, five to 10 tumors (n = 208). Cumulative rates of MMSE score maintenance (MMSE score decrease < 3 from baseline) determined with a competing risk analysis of groups A, B , and C were 93%, 91%, and 92%, respectively, at the 12th month after SRS; 91%, 89%, and 91%, respectively, at the 86%, and 89%, respectively, at the 48th month ( hazard ratio [ HR] of group A vs. group B, 0.719; 95% CI, 0.437- 1.172; p = 0.18; HR of B vs. group C, 1.280; 95% CI, 0.696- 2.508; p = 0.43).During observations 0.3 to 67.5 months (median, 12.0 months; interquartile range, 5.8 -26.5 months), as of December 2014 , 145 patients (12.1%) had SRS - induced complications. The cumulative complication incidences by competing risk analysis for groups A, B, and C were 7%, 8%, and 6%, respectively, at the 12th month after SRS; 10%, 11%, and 11%, respectively, at the 12%, 12%, and 13%, respectively, at the 48th month (HR of group A vs. group B, 0.850; 95% CI, 0.592 to 1.220; p = 0.38; HR of group B vs. group C, 1.052; 95% CI, 0.666 to 1.662, p = 0.83). Leukoenc ephalopathy occurred in 12 of the 1,074 patients (1.1%) with follow -up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and was detected after salvage WBRT in 11 of these 12 patients. In those 11 patients, leukoencephalopathy was detected by MRI 5.2 to 21.2 months (median, 11.0 months; interquartile range, 7.0 to 14.4 months) after WBRT. The authors concluded that neither Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 7 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. MMSE score maintenance or post -SRS complication incidence differed among groups A, B, and C and that this longer -term follow -up study further supports the noninferiority of SRS alone for patients with five to 10 BMs vs. two to four BMs. Farris et al. (2017) conducted a single -center, retrospective, cohort analysis to characterize BMV as a prognostic metric for patient outcomes with BM s, determine the factors that predict for higher BMV, and determine whether BMV is associated with other i mportant clinical outcomes such as OS and likelihood of neurologic death. The BMV score is the cumulative number of new BMs that developed after the first SRS divided by time (years) since the initial SRS. Patients are categorized into three classes based on their BMV scores (i.e., 3, 4 to 13, and 14). Histology, number of metastases at the time of first SRS, and systemic disease status were assessed for effect on BMV. Following initial SRS treatment, patients were followed up with MRI of the brain and clinical examination at four to eight weeks after the procedure and thereafter every three months. The number of new metastases on every follow -up MRI scan was recorded to generate the BMV. A new metastasis was determined on follow -up MRI to be completely outside of the prior radiosurgical treatment volume as defined by the prescription isodose line. Of 737 patients treated with upfront SRS without WBRT, 286 (38.8%) had 1 distant brain failure (DBF) event. The median follow -up was estimated at 66.5 months (95% CI, 50.9 to 85.7 months) and median OS from the time of first SRS for all patients with BMV data was 16.3 months (95% CI, 14.6 to 18.6 months). A lower BMV predicted for improved OS following initial DBF (p < 0.0001). Median OS for the low, intermedi ate, and high BMV groups was 12.4 months (95% CI, 10.4 to 16.9 months), 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.0 to 9.7 months), and 4.3 months (95% CI, 2.6 to 6.7 months), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that BMV remained the dominant predictor of OS, with a HR of 2.75 for the high BMV group (95% CI, 1.94 to 3.89; p < 0.0001) and a HR of 1.65 for the intermediate BMV group (95% CI, 1.18 to 2.30; p < 0.004). A lower BMV was associated with decreased rates of salvage WBRT (p = 0.02) and neurologic death (p = 0.008). Factors predictive for a higher BMV included 2 initial BMs (p = 0.004) and melanoma histology (p = 0.008). The authors concluded that BMV is a novel metric associated with OS, neurologic death, and need for salvage WBRT after initial DBF following upf ront SRS alone. Brown et al. (2016) conducted a multi -center, randomized trial to determine whether there is less cognitive deterioration at three months after SRS alone vs. SRS plus WBRT. Adult patients ( 18 years of age) with one to three BMs , all smaller than 3 .0 cm in diameter, were eligible for the trial. Patients who were randomly assigned to SRS alone received 24 Gy in a single fraction if lesions were less than 2.0 cm or 20 Gy if lesions were 2 -2.9 cm in maximum diameter. Patients who were ran domly assigned to SRS plus WBRT received 22 Gy in a single fraction if lesions were less than 2.0 cm or 18 Gy if lesions were 2 -2.9 cm in maximum diameter. Patients who were randomly assigned to SRS plus WBRT received 30 Gy in 12 fractions of 2.5 -Gy WBRT delivered five days a week. Whole brain radiotherapy began within 14 days of SRS. The primary end point was cognitive deterioration (decline > 1 standard deviation (SD) from baseline on at least one cognitive test at three months) in participants who comple ted the baseline and 3 -month assessments. Secondary end points included time to intracranial failure, QOL, functional independence, long -term cognitive status, and OS. A total of 213 patients participated in the study (SRS alone, n = 111; SRS plus WBRT, n = 102) with a mean age of 60.6 years (SD, 10.5 years) and 103 (48%) were women. There was less cognitive deterioration at three months after SRS alone (40/63 patients [63.5%]) than when combined with 14.4%; p < 0.001). Quality of life was higher at three months with SRS alone, including overall QOL (mean change from baseline, 0.1 vs. 12.0 points; mean difference, 11.9; 95% CI, 4.8 to 19.0 points; p = 0.001). Time to intracranial failure was significantly shorter for SRS alone compared with SRS plus WBRT (HR, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.2 to 5.9; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in functional independence at three months between the treatment groups. Median OS was 10.4 months for SRS alo ne and 7.4 months for SRS plus WBRT (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.38; p = 0.92). For long -term survivors, the incidence of cognitive deterioration was less after SRS alone at three months (5/11 [45.5%] vs. 16/17 [94.1%]; difference, 34.4%; 95% CI, 74.4% to 5.5%; p = 0.04). The authors concluded that among patients with one to three BMs , the use of SRS alone, compared with SRS combined with WBRT, resulted in less cognitive deterioration at three months, and that in the absence of a difference in OS, these findings suggest that for patients with one to three BMs amenable to RS, SRS alone may be a preferred strategy. Minniti et al. (2016) conducted a case series analysis to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of repeated SRS in patients with recurrent/progressive BMs . A total of 43 patients (21 men and 22 women) with 47 lesions received a second course of SRS given in t hree daily fractions of 7 -8 Gy. With a follow -up study of 19 months, the 1 - and 2 -year survival rates from repeated SRS were 37% and 20%, respectively, and the 1 - and 2 -year local control ( LC) rates were 70% and 60 %, respectively. Actuarial LC was significantly better for breast and lung metastases as compared with melanoma metastases; 1 -year LC rates were 38% for for breast carcinoma and 73% for NSCLC metastases (p = 0.01). The cause of death was progressive systemic disease in 25 patients and progressive brain disease in 11 patients. Stable extracranial disease (p = 0.01) and KPS (p = 0.03) were predictive of longer survival. Radiologic changes suggestive of brain radionecrosis were observed in nine (19%) out of 47 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 8 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. lesions, with a n actuarial risk of 34% at 12 months. Neurological deficits (RTOG Grade 2 or 3) associated with brain necrosis occurred in 14% of patients. The authors concluded that a second course of SRS given in three daily fractions is a feasible treatment for selected patients with recurrent/progressive BMs , and additional studies that explore the efficacy and safety of different dose -fractionation schedules, especially in patients with melanoma or large metastases are needed. Kocher et al. (2011) and the European Or ganization for Research and Treatment of Cancer conducted a multi -center, randomized trial (EORTC 22952- 26001) to assess whether adjuvant WBRT increases the duration of functional independence after surgery or RS of BMs . Patients with one to three BMs of solid tumors (small- cell lung cancer excluded) with stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors and World Health Organization (WHO) performance status (PS) of 0 -2 were treated with complete surgery or RS and randomly assigned to adjuvant WBRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) or OBS. The primary end point was time to WHO PS deterioration to more than two and secondary end points were frequency of intracranial relapse at initially treated and at new sites, PFS, OS, late toxicities, and QOL. Of 359 patients, 199 underwent RS, and 160 underwent surgery. In the RS group, 100 patients were allocated to OBS, and 99 were allocated to WBRT. After surgery, 79 patients were allocated to OBS, and 81 were allocated to adjuvant WBRT. The median time to WHO PS more than t wo was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 11.7 months) after OBS and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 11.9 months) after WBRT (p = 0.71). O verall survival was similar in the WBRT and OBS arms (median, 10.9 vs. 10.7 months, respectively; p=0.89). WBRT reduced the 2- year relapse rate both at initial sites (surgery: 59% to 27%, < 0.001; RS: 31% and 23%, 0.008; RS: 48% to 33%, p = 0.023). Salvage therapies were used more frequently after OBS than after WBRT. Intracrania l progression caused death in 78 (44%) of 179 patients in the OBS arm and in 50 (28%) of 180 patients in the WBRT arm. The authors concluded that after RS or surgery for a limited number of BMs , adjuvant WBRT reduces intracranial relapses and neurologic de aths but fails to improve the duration of functional independence and OS. Aoyama et al. (2006) conducted a multi -center, randomized, controlled trial to determine if WBRT combined with SRS results in improvements in survival, brain tumor control, function al preservation rate, and frequency of neurologic death. Patients with one to four BMs, each less than 3 .0 cm in diameter were randomized to receive WBRT plus SRS or SRS alone. The primary end point was OS and secondary end points were brain tumor recurren ce, salvage brain treatment, functional preservation, toxic effects of radiation, and cause of death. A total of 132 patients were enrolled (WBRT plus SRS, n = 65; SRS alone, n = 67). The median survival time and the 1 -year actuarial survival rate were 7.5 months and 38.5% (95% CI, 26.7 to 50.3%) in the WBRT + SRS group and 8.0 months and 28.4% (95% CI, 17.6 to 39.2%) for SRS alone (p = 0.42). The 12 -month brain tumor recurrence rate was 46.8% in the WBRT + SRS group and 76.4% for SRS alone group (p < 0.001). Salvage brain treatment was less frequently required in the WBRT + SRS group (n = 10) than with SRS alone (n = 29) (p < 0.001). Death was attributed to neurologic causes in 22.8% of patients in the WBRT + SRS group and in 19.3% of those treated with SRS alone (p = 0.64). There were no significant differences in systemic and neurologic functional preservation and toxic effects of radiation. The authors concluded that compared with SRS alone, the use of WBRT plus SRS did not improve survival for patient s with one to four BMs, but intracranial relapse occurred considerably more frequently in those who did not receive WBRT. Consequently, salvage treatment is frequently required when up -front WBRT is not used. Andrews et al. (2004) and the Radiation Therap y Oncology Group (RTOG) conducted a multi -center, randomized trial to assess whether SRS provided any therapeutic benefit in patients newly diagnosed with BMs . Patients with one to three newly diagnosed BMs were randomly assigned to either WBRT or WBRT fol lowed by an SRS boost. Patients were stratified by number of metastases and status of extracranial disease. The primary outcome was survival and secondary outcomes were tumor response and local rates, overall intracranial recurrence rates, cause of death, and performance measurements. A total of 333 patients participated in the study with 167 patients assigned WBRT and SRS and 164 patients assigned to WBRT alone. Univariate analysis showed that there was a survival advantage in the WBRT and SRS group for patients with a single brain metastasis (median survival time 6.5 vs 4.9 months, p = 0.0393). Patients in the SRS group were more likely to have a stable or improved KPS scores at six months of follow -up than were patients allocated WBRT alone (43% vs. 27%, respectively; p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed that survival improved in patients with an RPA class one (p < 0.0001) or a favorable histological status (p = 0.0121). The authors concluded that WBRT and stereotactic boost treatment improved functiona l autonomy for all patients and survival for patients with a single unresectable brain metastasis and therefore, should be standard treatment fo r patients with a single unresectable brain metastasis and considered for patients with two or three BM s.

Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. Clinical Practice Guidelines American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) In a 2022 ASTRO clinical practice guideline entitled Radiation Therapy for Brain Metastases , BM s are addressed. ASTRO strongly recommends SRS for patients with an ECOG of 0 -2 and up to four intact brain BM s. Single -fraction SRS with a dose of 2000- 2400 cGy is strongly recommended for patients with intact BM s measuring < 2 cm in diameter, if multifra ction SRS is given, options include 2700 cGy in three fractions or 3000cGy in five fractions. SRS is strongly recommended to improve LC in patients with resected BMs . For patients with resected BM s and limited additional BM s, SRS is strongly recommended ov er WBRT to preserve neurocognitive function and patient QOL . For patients with a favorable prognosis and BM s receiving WBRT, ASTRO strongly recommends, hippocampal avoidance with the addition of memantine. ASTRO suggests there is an ongoing need for inclus ive clinical trials that assess different modalities and have endpoints such as survival, cognitive outcomes, and QOL (Gondi et al., 2022). American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) ASCO determined that the recommendations from the ASTRO Radiation The rapy for Brain Metastases Clinical Practice Guideline are clear, thorough, and based upon the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the guideline above (Schiff et al., 2022). National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Per NCCN, SRS is general ly preferred over WBRT for limited brain metastasis. When compared to postoperative WBRT, SRS to the surgical cavity offers similar OS and superior overall cognitive preservation. Common dose -fractionation schedules include 16-20 Gy in one fraction, 27 Gy in three fractions, and 30 Gy in five fractions (NCCN, 2022). Chordoma and Chondrosarcoma Kano et al. (2015) conducted a multicentered retrospective evaluation to analyze the outcome of SRS for patients with chondrosarcoma who underwent this treatment as part of a multimodality management. Forty -six patients who underwent SRS for skull- based chondrosarcomas were identified at seven participating centers of the N orth American Gamma Knife Consortium (NAGKC). Thirty -six patients had previously undergone tumor resections and five had been treated with fractionated radiation therapy. The median tumor volume was 8.0 cm3 (range 0.9 -28.2 cm3), and the median margin dose was 15 Gy (range 10.5- 20 Gy). At a median follow -up of 75 months after SRS, eight patients were deceased. The actuarial OS after SRS was 89% at three years, 86% at five years, and 76% at 10 years. Local tumor progression occurred in 10 patients. The rate of PFS after SRS was 88% at three years, 85% at five years, and 70% at 10 years. Prior radiation therapy was significantly associated with shorter PFS. Eight patients required salvage resection, and three patients (7%) developed AREs. Cranial nerve deficits improved in 22 (56%) of the 39 patients who deficits before SRS. Clinical improvement after SRS was noted in patients with abducens nerve paralysis (61%), oculomotor nerve paralysis (50%), lower cranial nerve dysfunction (50%), optic neuropathy (43%), (12%), and hearing loss (10%). Limitations include the retrospective nature of the study and length of follow up of less than 12 months for some patients. The authors concluded that SRS provided a reasonable benefit -to-risk profile for patients with residual or newly diagnosed small skull base chondrosarcomas and maximal safe resection should be the primary initial management. The authors additionally note SRS as a potent treatment option for small to medium -sized chondrosarcomas that is associated with improvement of cranial nerve function in selected cases, especially for patients who present with diplopia related to abducen s nerve palsy. Hasegawa et al. (2007) conducted a case s eries analysis to evaluate outcomes of patients with skull base chordomas and chondrosarcomas and treated with SRS, and to determine which tumors are appropriate for SRS as adjuvant therapy following maximum tumor resection. A total of 37 patients (48 lesi ons) were treated using GKS; 27 had chordomas, seven had chondrosarcomas, and three had radiologically diagnosed chordomas. The mean tumor volume was 20 ml, and the mean maximum and marginal doses were 28 and 14 Gy, respectively. The mean follow -up period was 97 months from diagnosis and 59 months from GKS. The actuarial 5 - and 10 -year survival rates after GKS were 80% and 53%, respectively. The actuarial 5 - and 10-year local tumor control (LTC) rates after single or multiple GKS sessions were 76% and 67%, respectively. All patients with low-grade chondrosarcomas achieved good LTC. A tumor volume of less than 20 ml significantly affected the high rate of LTC (p = 0.0182). None of the patients had AREs, other than one in whom facial numbness worsened despite successful tumor control. The authors concluded that as an adjuvant treatment after resection, GKS is a reasonable option for selected patient s harboring skull base chordomas or chondrosarcomas with a residual tumor volume of less than 20 ml. They also con cluded Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 10 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. that dose planning with a generous treatment volume to avoid marginal treatment failure should be made at a marginal dose of at least 15 Gy to achieve long -term tumor control. Martin et al. (2007) conducted a case series analysis to evaluate the ef fect of SRS on local tumor control and survival in patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas. A total of 28 patients with histologically confirmed chordomas (n = 18) or chondrosarcomas (n = 10) underwent GKRS either as primary or adjuvant treatment. Thei r ages ranged from 17 to 72 years (median 44 years). The most common presenting symptom was diplopia (26 patients, 93%). In two patients, SRS was the sole treatment. Twenty -six patients underwent between one and five additional surgical procedures. Two und erwent an initial transsphenoidal biopsy. The average tumor volume was 9.8 cm3. The median dose to the tumor margin was 16 Gy. Transient symptomatic AREs developed in only one patient. The actuarial local tumor control for chondrosarcomas at five years was 80 +/- 10.1%. For chordomas both the actuarial tumor control and survival was 62.9 +/ - 10.4%. The authors concluded that SRS is an important option for skull base chordomas and chondrosarcomas either as primary or adjunctive treatment, and that multimodal management appears crucial to improve tumor control in most patients. No\u00ebl et al. (2003) conducted a single -center case series analysis to evaluate outcomes of patients with chordomas or chondrosarcomas and treated with fractionated photon and proton radiation. Outcomes included local tumor control, survival and treatment co mplications. A total of 67 patients with a median age of 52 years (range, 14 to 85 years) were treated using the 201-MeV proton beam, 49 for chordoma and 18 for chondrosarcoma. Irradiation combined high -energy photons and protons. Photons represented two thirds of the total dose and protons one third. The median total dose delivered within gross tumor volume (GTV) was 67 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE; range, 60 to 70 CGE). The median follow -up time was 29 months (range, four to 71 months). The 3 -year LC rate s were 71% and 85% for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, respectively, and the 3 -year OS rates 88% and 75%, respectively. Fourteen tumors (21.5%) failed locally (eight within the GTV, four within the clinical ta rget volume [CTV], and two without further asses sment). Seven patients died from their tumor and one from a nonrelated condition (pulmonary embolism). The maximum tumor diameter and the GTV were larger in relapsing patients, compared with the rest of the population: 56 mm vs. 44 mm (p = 0.024) and 50 ml vs. 22 ml (p = 0.0083), respectively. In univariate analysis, age 52 years at the time of radiotherapy (p = 0.002), maximum diameter < 45 mm (p = 0.02), and GTV < 28 ml (p = 0.02) impacted positively on LC. On multivariate analysis, only age was an independent prognostic factor of LC. The authors concluded that in patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base and cervical spine, combined photon and proton radiation therapy offers excellent chances of cure, and that their results shoul d be confirmed with longer follow -up. Craniopharyngioma Lee et al. (2014 a) conducted a single -center case series analysis to report long -term outcomes of patients with craniopharyngioma and treated with RS, and to define the prognostic factors of craniopharyngioma. Patients with craniopharyngioma were treated by GKS and then, all the patients underwent clinical and endocrinological evaluations at an average of 6 -month intervals. Patient demographics and clinical data including outcome of resection, adjuvan t radiosurgical parameters, and imaging results were retrospectively reviewed from the center's database. Outcomes included tumor control, PFS, OS, complications and prognostic factors. A total of 137 consecutive patients who underwent 162 sessions of GKS treatments were included in the analysis. The patients' median age was 30.1 years (range, 1.5 to 84.9 years), and the median tumor volume was 5.5 ml (range, 0.2 to 28.4 ml). There were 23 solid (16.8%), 23 cystic (16.8%), and 91 mixed solid and cysti c (66.4%) craniopharyngiomas. GKS was indicated for residual or recurrent craniopharyngiomas. The median radiation dose was 12 Gy (range, 9.5 to 16.0 Gy) at a median isodose line of 55% (range, 50% to 78%). At a median imaging follow -up of 45.7 months after GKS, the rates of tumor control were 72.7%, 73.9%, and 66.3% for the solid, cystic, and mixed tumors, respectively. The actuarial PFS rates plotted by the Kaplan -Meier method were 70.0% and 43.8% at five and 10 years after RS, respectively. After repeated GKS, the actuarial PFS rates were increased to 77.3% and 61.2% at five and 10 years, respectively. The OS rates were 91.5% and 83.9% at the 5 - and 10 -year follow -ups, respectively. Successful GKS treatment can be predicted by tumor volume (p = 0.011). Among th e 137 patients who had clinical follow -up, new -onset or worsened pituitary deficiencies were detected in 11 patients (8.0%). Two patients without tumor growth had a worsened visual field, and one patient had a new onset of third cranial nerve palsy. The au thors concluded that their study results suggest that GKS is a relatively safe modality for the treatment of recurrent or residual craniopharyngiomas, and GKS is associated with improved tumor control and reduced in-field recurrence rates. Niranjan et al. (2010) conducted a single -center case series analysis to evaluate outcomes of gamma knife SRS for residual or recurrent craniopharyngiomas and evaluate the factors that optimized the tumor control rates. A total of 46 patients with craniopharyngiomas unde rwent 51 SRS procedures. The series included 22 males and 24 females, with a median age of 23.5 years (range, four to 77). The median tumor volume was 1.0 cm 3 (range, 0.07 to 8.0). The median prescription dose delivered to Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 11 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. the tumor margin was 13.0 Gy (ran ge, 9 to 20). The median maximal dose was 26.0 Gy (range, 20 to 50). The mean follow -up time was 62.2 months (range, 12 to 232). The OS rate after SRS was 97.1% at 5 years. The 3- and 5 -year PFS rates (solid tumor control) were both 91.6%. The overall LC r ate (for both solid tumor and cyst control) was 91%, 81%, and 68% at one , three , and five years, respectively. No patients with normal pituitary function developed hypopituitarism after SRS. Two patients developed homonymous hemianopsia owing to tumor prog ression after SRS. Among the factors examined, complete radiosurgical coverage was a significant favorable prognostic factor. The authors concluded that SRS is a safe and effective minimally invasive option for the management of residual or recurrent crani opharyngiomas, and that complete radiosurgical coverage of the tumor was associated with better tumor control. Kobayashi et al. (2005) conducted a single -center case series analysis to evaluate long -term outcomes of patients treated with GKS for residual or recurrent craniopharyngiomas after microsurgery, and the effects of dose reduction. A total of 107 patients with craniopharyngiomas were treated with GKS, and 98 patients were followed up for six to 148 months (mean 65.5 months). The mean tumor diameter and volume were 18.8 mm and 3.5 ml, respectively. The tumors were treated with a maximal dose of 21.8 Gy and a tumor margin dose of 11.5 Gy by using a mean of 4.5 isocenters. Final overall response rates were as follows: complete response 19.4%, partial r esponse 67.4%, tumor control 79.6%, and tumor progression 20.4%. Reducing the tumor margin dose resulted in decreased therapeutic response and increased tumor progression, although the rate of visual and pituitary function loss also decreased. Among the fa ctors examined, age (for adults) and the nature of the tumor (cystic or mixed) were statistically significant favorable and unfavorable prognostic factors, respectively. The actuarial 5 - and 10 -year survival rates were 94.1 and 91%, respectively. The PFS r ates were 60.8 and 53.8%, respectively. Patient outcomes were reportedly excellent in 45 cases, good in 23, fair in four, and poor in three; 16 patients died. Deterioration both in vision and endocrinological functions were documented as side effects in si x patients (6.1%). The authors concluded that stereotactic GKS is safe and effective, in the long term, as an adjuvant or boost therapy for residual or recurrent craniopharyngiomas aft er surgical removal and has minimal side effects. Definitive Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) without Evidence Regional or Distant Metastasis Jang et al. (2020) conducted a multi -center, phase II, single -arm, open -label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT for patients with HCC in a hepatitis B virus -endemic area. Eligible patients were aged 20 years who were diagnosed with unresectable HCC. Patients received SBRT with 45 to 60 Gy in three fractions. To evaluate gastroduodenal toxicity, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed before and two mon ths after SBRT. The primary endpoint was treatment - related severe toxicity at one year after SBRT. The secondary endpoints were the 2 -year LC, PFS , and OS rates. A total of 74 patients were enrolled, and 65 eligible patients were analyzed. The median follo w-up was 41 months (range, four to 69 months). One patient experienced radiation -induced liver disease with acute grade 3 toxicity 1 month after SBRT. In addition, one patient had a grade 3 esophageal ulcer with stenosis five months after SBRT. The actua rial rate of treatment -related severe toxicity at one year was 3%. The pre -SBRT and post -SBRT EGD findings were not significantly different among the 57 evaluable patients who underwent EGD. The 2 -year and 3 -year LC rates were 97% and 95%, respectively. Th e progression -free and OS rates were 48% and 84% at two years, respectively, and 36% and 76% at three years, respectively. The authors concluded that SBRT for patients with HCC is well tolerated and is an effective treatment modality. Rim et al. (2019) conducted a systematic review and meta -analysis to evaluate the clinical feasibility and efficacy of SB RT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A search, using predetermine criteria, was performed using PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Primary endpoints were OS and LC and the secondary endpoint was grade 3 complications. A total of 3 2 studies, comprising 33 cohorts and consisting of 1,950 patients were included in the meta -analysis. The majority (85%) of the studies used a retrospective design. Pooled 1 -, 2-, and 3 -year OS rates were 72.6% (95% CI, 65.7 to 78.6), 57.8% (50.9 to 48.3% (40.3 to 56.5), respectively. Pooled 1- , 2-, and 3 -year LC were 83.9% (77.6 to 88.6), respectively. The overall median tumor size was 3.3 cm (range, 1.6 to 8.6). Median radiation dose s, calculated in equivalent dose in 2 Gy per fraction, ranged from 48 to 114.8 Gy (median 83.3 Gy). A subgroup comparison of tumor size showed significant differences for 1 - and 2 -year OS rates and 1 -, 2-, and 3 -year LC rates. In addition, radiation dose s howed no difference for OS and a marginal difference for 1 -year LC rate. Pooled rates of hepatic and gastrointestinal grade 3 complications were 4.7% (95% CI, 3.4 to 6.5) and 3.9% (2.6 to 5.6), respectively. Child -Pugh class was significantly correlated with hepatic complication of grade 3 (p = 0.013). The authors concluded that SBRT for HCC is a feasible option with excellent LC persisting up to three years. They reported that both OS and LC were affected by tumor size, and radiation dose marginally af fected LC, and while severe complications were rare, liver function should be considered to prevent serious hepatic toxicity. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 12 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. Wahl et al. (2016) conducted a single -center, retrospective, cohort analysis to compare outcomes of patients diagnosed with HCC an d treated with SBRT and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Data for the analysis was obtained from the center's database and clinical records were reviewed to verify patient and tumor characteristics, treatment details, and clinical outcomes. The primary end p oint was freedom from local progression (FFLP) defined at the lesion level as the time from treatment initiation until subsequent local progression or last follow -up, and the secondary endpoint was toxicity. A total of 224 patients with inoperable, nonmeta static HCC were included in the analysis. Of those, 161 patients (249 tumors) underwent RFA and 63 patients (83 tumors) underwent image -guided SBRT. RFA and SBRT groups were similar with respect to number of lesions treated per patient, type of underlying liver disease, and tumor size (median, 1.8 vs. 2.2 cm in maximum diameter; p = 0.14). However, the SBRT group had lower pretreatment Child -Pugh scores (p = 0.003), higher pretreatment alpha -fetoprotein levels (p = 0.04), and a greater number of prior liver- directed treatments (p < 0.001). One - and 2 -year FFLP for tumors treated with RFA were 83.6% and 80.2% vs. 97.4% and 83.8% for SBRT. Increasing tumor size predicted for FFLP in patients treated with RFA (HR, 1.54 per cm; p = 0.006), but not with SBRT (HR, 1.21 per cm; p = 0.617). For tumors 2.0 cm, there was decreased FFLP for RFA compared with SBRT (HR, 3.35; p = 0.025). Acute grade 3 + complications occurred after 11% and 5% of RFA and SBRT treatments, respectively (p = 0.31). O verall survival one and two years after treatment was 70% and 53% after RFA and 74% and 46% after SBRT. The authors concluded that both RFA and SBRT are effective local treatment options for inoperable HCC, and although their data are retrospective, SBRT appears to be a reasonabl e first -line treatment of inoperable, larger HCC. Clinical Practice Guidelines American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) In an ASTRO guideline for primary liver cancers, using EBRT as a potential first -line treatment in patients with liver -confined HCC who are not candidates for curative therapy, as consolidative therapy after incomplete response to liver -directed therapies, and as a salvage option for local recurrences is strongly recommended. ASTRO conditionally recomme nds EBRT with liver HCC , or those with macrovascular invasion, sequenced with systemic or catheter - based therapies. Additionally, the authors recommend future high -quality RCTs to further define the role of EBRT in HCC treatment (Apisarnthanarax et al., 2021). National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) The NCCN guideline for hepatobiliary cancers states that SBRT for hepatocellular cancer SBRT can be considered as an alternative to ablation/embolization te chniques or when these therapies have failed or are contraindicated . SBRT is typically given in 3 -5 fractions and is often used for patients with 1 -3 tumors (NCCN, 202 2). Definitive Treatment of Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Chang et al. (2015) conducted a pooled analysis of two clinical trials (STARS and ROSEL) that were halted due to slow recruitment. The STARS (NCT00840749) and ROSEL (NCT00687986) trials were open -label, randomized, phase III trials comparing SABR with surgery for patients wit h stage I NSCLC. The primary outcome for this pooled analysis was OS according to treatment group (SABR vs. surgery) and secondary outcomes included recurrence- free survival, and grade 3 or worse acute or chronic toxicity. A total of 58 patients were enrol led with 31 patients randomized to SABR and 27 patients to surgery. Median follow -up was 40.2 months (IQR 23.0 to 47.3) for the SABR group and 35.4 months (18.9 to 40.7) for the surgery group. Six patients in the surgery group died compared with one patien t in the SABR group. Estimated OS at three years was 95% (95% CI 85 to 100) in the SABR group compared with 79% (64 -97) in the surgery group (HR, 0.14; 95% CI 0.017 to 1.190, log -rank p = Recurrence -free survival at three years was 86% (95% CI 74 t o 100) in the SABR group and 80% (65 to 97) in the surgery group (HR, 0.69; 95% CI 0.21 to 2.29, log -rank p = 0.54). In the surgery group, one patient had regional nodal recurrence and two had distant metastases; in the SABR group, one patient had local re currence, four had regional nodal recurrence, and one had distant metastases. Three (10%) patients in the SABR group had grade 3 treatment -related adverse events ( three patients with chest wall pain, two with dyspnea or cough, and one with fatigue and rib fracture). No patients given SABR had grade 4 events or treatment -related death. In the surgery group, one (4%) patient died of surgical complications and 12 (44%) patients had grade 3 -4 treatment -related adverse events. Grade 3 events occurring in more th an one patient in the surgery group were dyspnea ( four patients), chest pain ( four patients), and lung infections ( two patients). The authors concluded that the results of this pooled analysis of STARS and ROSEL data suggest that SABR can be considered a t reatment option in operable patients needing a lobectomy, and that the equipoise suggested by the results justifies efforts for additional randomized clinical trials. Haasbeek et al. (2010) conducted a single -center case series analysis to evaluate outco mes of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in elderly patients. Patients diagnosed with stage IA/IB NSCLC and aged 75 years at the time of SRT were included. SRT was Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 13 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. delivered using three fractionation schemes: fractions of 20 grays (Gy) (for T1 tumors), five fractions of 12 Gy (for T1 tumors with broad contact with the chest wall and for T2 tumors), or eight fractions of 7.5 Gy (for tumors adjacent to the heart, large blood vessels, hilus, brachial plexus, or mediastinum). Patients were followed routinely at three months, six months, one year, and annually thereafter. Outcomes included overall and disease free survival, and actuarial local, regional, and distant failure rates. A total of 193 patients aged 75 years were treated using SRT (118 T1 tumors, 85 T2 tumors). The median patient age was 79 years, 80% of patients were considered medically inoperable, and 20% of patients declined surgery. The median Charlson comorbidity score was four , and severe chron ic obstructive pulmonary disease (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Class III or greater) was present in 25% of patients. Risk adapted SRT schemes were used with the same total dose of 60 gy in three fractions (33%), five fractions (50 %), or eight fractions (17% of patients), depending on the patient's risk for toxicity. SRT was well tolerated, and all but one patient completed treatment. Survival rates at one year and three years were 86% and 45%, respectively. Survival was correlated with performance score (p = 0.001) and pre SRT lung function (p = 0.04). The actuarial LC rate at three years was 89%. Acute toxicity was rare, and late Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3 toxicity was observed in < 10% of patients. The authors conc luded that SRT achieved high LC rates with minimal toxicity in patients aged 75 years despite their significant medical comorbidities and that these results indicated that more active diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are justified in elderly patient s, and that SRT should be considered and discussed as a curative treatment alternative. Timmerman et al. (2010) conducted a multi -center, phase II, single arm trial (RTOG 0236) to evaluate toxicity and efficacy of SBRT in a high -risk population of patient s with early stage but medically inoperable lung cancer. Patients with biopsy -proven peripheral T1 -T2, N0, M0 non -small cell tumors less than 5 .0 cm in diameter and medical conditions precluding surgical treatment were included in the analysis. The prescri ption dose was 18 Gy per fraction in three fractions (54 Gy total) delivered in 1\u00bd-2 weeks. The primary endpoint was primary tumor control with OS, disease -free survival (DFS), adverse events, involved lobe, regional, and disseminated recurrence as seconda ry endpoints. The study aimed to improve the two -year primary tumor control rate from 60% to 80%. A rate of 60% was chosen as the lowest acceptable primary tumor control rate after taking into consideration a > 80% primary tumor control rate seen in a prev iously published study (Timmerman 2006). A total of 59 patients accrued, of which 55 were evaluable (44 T1 and 11 T2 tumors) with a median follow -up of 34.4 months (range, 4.8 to 49.9 months). Only one patient had a primary tumor failure; the estimated 3 -year primary tumor control rate was 97.6% (95% CI, 84.3% to 99.7%). Three patients had recurrence within the involved lobe; the 3 -year primary tumor and involved lobe (local) control rate was 90.6% (95% CI, 76.0% to 96.5%). Two patients experienced regional local- regional control rate was 87.2% (95%CI, 71.0%, 94.7%). Eleven patients experienced disseminated recurrence; the 3- year rate of disseminated failure was 22.1% (95% CI, 12.3% to 37.8%). The rates of DFS and OS at three years were 48.3% (95% CI, - 60.8%) and 55.8% (95% 67.9%), The median OS was 48.1 months (95% CI, 29.6% to not reached). Protocol specified treatment- related grade 3 adverse events were reported in seven patients (12.7%; 95% CI, 9.6% to 15.8%) ; grade 4 events were reported in two patients (3.6%; 95%CI, 2.7% to 4.5%). No grade 5 adverse events were reported. The authors concluded that patients with inoperable NSCLC who received SBRT had a survival rate of 55.8% at three years and high rates of l ocal tumor control compared to historical data. Fakiris et al. (2009) conducted a single -center, phase II, single arm trial to report 50 -month follow -up results from a phase I dose escalation trial in patients with medically inoperable Stage I NSCLC (Timm erman 2003 and McGarry 2005). A total of 70 medically inoperable patients who had clinically staged T1 (34 patients) or T2 (36 patients) M0, biopsy -confirmed a Gy prescribed to the 80% isodose vo lume in three fractions. Median follow - up was 50.2 months (range, 1.4 to 64.8 months). Kaplan -Meier LC at three years was 88.1%. Regional (nodal) and distant recurrence occurred in six (8.6%) and nine (12.9%) patients, respectively. Median survival (MS) wa s 32.4 months and 3- year OS was 42.7% (95% CI, 31.1 to 54.3%). Cancer -specific survival at three years was 81.7% (95% CI, 70.0 to 93.4%). For patients with T1 tumors, MS was 38.7 months (95% CI, 25.3 to 50.2) and for T2 tumors MS was 24.5 months (95% CI, 18.5 to 37.4) (p = 0.194). Tumor volume ( 5 cc, 5 -10 cc, 10- 20 cc, > 20 cc) did not significantly impact survival: MS was 36.9 months (95% CI, 18.1 to 42.9), 34.0 (95% CI, 16.9 to 57.1), 32.8 (95% CI, 21.3 to 57.8), and 21.4 months (95% CI, 17.8 to 41.6), respectively (p = 0.712). There was no significant difference in survival between patients with peripheral vs. central tumors (MS 33.2 vs. 24.4 months, p = 0.697). Grade 3- 5 toxicity occurred in five of 48 patients with peripheral lung tumors (10.4% ) and in six of 22 patients (27.3%) with central tumors (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.088). The authors concluded that use of SBRT results in high rates of LC in medically inoperable patients with Stage I NSCLC. Onishi et al. (2007) reported updated results of a multi -center case series analysis conducted to determine the optimal small - volume stereotactic RT (SRT) dose that would limit toxicity and obtain LC in patients with stage I NSCLC, whether the single - institution results were reproducible, and whether single high dose stereotactic irradiation (STI) results were comparable to Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 14 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. those of surgery. In the original study (Onishi 2004), the authors concluded that hypofractionated high dose STI with BED < 150 Gy represents a feasible and beneficial method for o btaining curative treatment of patients with Stage I NSCLC. The authors reported that LC and survival rates were better for BED 100 Gy than for BED < 100 Gy for all treatment methods and schedules. In addition, survival rates for STI in selected patients (medically operable and BED 100 Gy) were excellent and reproducible among institutions, irrespective of specific treatment methods, and were potentially equivalent to those of surg ery. In the updated report, Onishi (2007) compared previously reported re sults for surgery and conventional RT with those for hypofractionated high- dose stereotactic RT (HypoFXSRT). In this retrospective study, 257 patients with stage I NSCLC (median age, 74 years: 164 T1N0M0, 93 T2N0M0) were treated with HypoFXSRT alone at 14 institutions. Stereotactic three -dimensional treatment was performed using noncoplanar dynamic arcs or multiple static ports. A total dose of 18 to 75 Gy at the isocenter was administered in one to 22 fractions. The median calculated biological effective d ose (BED) was 111 Gy (range, 57 to 180 Gy) based on / = 10. For the comparison to surgery, the 5 -year OS rates for patients with stage IA and IB NSCLC and treated with surgery ranged from 61% to 72% and 40% to 50%, respectively (Mountain 2000, Naruke 200 1 and Shirakusa 2002). During follow -up (median, 38 months), pulmonary complications of above grade 2 occurred in 14 patients (5.4%). Local progression occurred in 36 patients (14.0%), and the local recurrence rate was 8.4% for a BED of 100 Gy or more comp ared with 42.9% for less than 100 Gy (p < 0.001). The 5- year OS rate of medically operable patients was 70.8% among those treated with a BED of 100 Gy or more compared with 30.2% among those treated with less than 100 Gy (p < 0.05). The authors concluded t hat when compared with conventional RT and surgery, HypoFXSRT is a safe and promising treatment modality, LC and survival rates are superior to those of conventional RT, HypoFXSRT should be a standard of care for medically inoperable patients, and addition al studies that randomly compare HypoFXSRT and surgery for medically operable patients are needed. Nagata et al. (2005) conducted a phase I/II single arm trial to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with stage I lung cancer and treated with 48 Gy o f three -dimensional stereotactic radiotherapy in four fractions. Forty -five patients were included in this study, 32 patients had Stage IA lung cancer, and the other 13 patients had Stage IB lung cancer where tumor size was less tha n 4.0 cm in diameter. Th ree-dimensional treatment planning using 6 -10 noncoplanar beams was performed to maintain the target dose homogeneity and to decrease the irradiated lung volume > 20 Gy. All patients were irradiated using a stereotactic body frame and received four single 12 Gy high doses of radiation at the isocenter over five to 13 (median = 12) days. Seven tumors (16%) completely disappeared after treatment (CR) and 38 tumors (84%) decreased in size by 30% or more (PR). Therefore, all tumors showed local response. During the median follow -up of 30 months (range, six to 71 months), no pulmonary complications greater than a National Cancer Institute -Common Toxicity Criteria of Grade 3 were noted. No other vascular, cardiac, esophageal, or neurologic toxicities were encounte red. Forty -four (98%) of 45 tumors were locally controlled during the follow -up period. However, regional recurrences and distant metastases occurred in three and five of T1 patients and zero and four of T2 patients, respectively. For Stage IA lung cancer, the DFS and OS rates after one and three years were 80% and 72%, and 92% and 83%, respectively, whereas for Stage IB lung cancer, the DFS and OS rates were 92% and 71%, and 82% and 72%, respectively. The authors concluded that 48 Gy of 3D stereotactic rad iotherapy in four fractions using a stereotactic body frame is useful for the treatment of Stage I lung tumors. Clinical Practice Guidelines American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) ASTRO's 2018 guideline, Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Early -Stage Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer, recommends that patients with stage I NSCLC should be evaluated by a thoracic surgeon, preferably within a multidisciplinary cancer care team , to determine operability. F or patients with standard operative risk (i.e., with anticipated operative mortality of < 1.5%) and stage I NSCLC, SBRT is not recommended as an alternative to surgery outside of a clinical trial setting. For patients with high opera tive risk (i.e., those who cannot tolerate lobectomy, but are candidates for sublobar resection) and stage I NSCLC, discussions about SBRT as a potential alternative to surgery are encouraged and patients should be informed that SBRT may have decreased risks from treatment in th e short term however, outcomes longer than three years are not well -established (Schneider 2018). National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) The NCCN guideline for NSCLC states that for stage I and selected node- negative stage IIA , SBRT has achieved goo d primary tumor control rates and OS that are higher than conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. NCCN recommends definitive SBRT for p atients with stage I and II NSCLC who are medically inoperable , and SBRT may be a reasonable alternative to surgery for patients with potentially operable disease who are high risk, elderly, or refuse surgery after appropriate consultation (NCCN, 2022).

Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. Definitive Treatment of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma without Evidence of Distant Metastasis In a retrospective review, Zhon g et al. (2017) compared SBRT with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (CFRT) in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) using the National Cancer Database. Patients with cT2 -4/N0 -1/M0 adenocarcinoma of the pancreas diagnosed from 2004 to 2013 were included in the review. Radiation therapy delivered at 4 Gy per fraction was considered SBRT, and radiation therapy delivered at 2 Gy was deemed CFRT. Overall survival was the primary outcome. The total number of patients included in the review wa s 8,450, CFRT = 7,819 and SBRT = 631. Receipt of SBRT was associated with superior OS in the multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.75 -0.93; p < .001). With propensity score matching, 988 patients in all were matched, with 49 4 patients in each cohort. Within the propensity -matched cohorts, the median OS (13.9 vs 11.6 months) and the 2 -year OS rate (21.7% vs 16.5%) were significantly higher with SBRT versus CFRT. The authors concluded SBRT was superior to OS when compared with CRFT, and an additional benefit of SBRT was the shorter duration of treatment. Additionally, the authors recommend future randomized trials to evaluate these results. Limitations include the retrospective nature of the study and lack of control for the spe cific type of chemotherapy in propensity matching. Herman et al. (2015) conducted a multi -center, phase II, single arm study to determine whether patients treated with gemcitabine (GEM) administered with fractionated SBRT (in five fractions of 6.6 Gy, to a total 33.0 Gy) would achieve reduced late grade 2 -4 GI toxicity compared with a historical cohort of patients treated with GEM and a single 25 -Gy fraction of SBRT. Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) received up to three doses of GEM (1000 mg/m 2) followed by a 1 - week break and SBRT (33.0 Gy in five fractions). After SBRT, patients continued to receive GEM until disease progression or toxicity. Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.0] and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Grou p radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ -C30) and pancreatic cancer -specific QLQ -PAN26 module before SBRT and at four weeks and four months after SBRT. A total of 49 patients participated in the study with a median follow -up of 13.9 months (range, 3.9 to 45.2 months). The median age of the patients was 67 years and 84% had tumors of the pancreatic head. Rates of acute and late (primary endpoin t) grade 2 gastritis, fistula, enteritis, or ulcer toxicities were 2% and 11%, respectively. The historical cohort rates for of grade 2 acute and late toxicities were 19% and 47%, respectively (Schellenberg 2008). QLQ -C30 global QOL scores remained sta ble from baseline to after SBRT (67 at baseline, median change of 0 at both follow -ups; p > 0.05 for both). Patients reported a significant improvement in pancreatic pain (p = 0.001) 4 weeks after SBRT on the QLQ -PAN26 questionnaire. The median plasma carb ohydrate antigen 19 -9 (CA 19- 9) level was reduced after SBRT (median time after SBRT, 4.2 weeks; 220 U/mL vs. 62 U/mL [p < 0.001]). The median OS was 13.9 months (95% CI, 10.2 to 16.7 months). Freedom from local disease progression at one year was 78%. Fou r patients (8%) underwent margin -negative and lymph node -negative surgical resections. The authors concluded that fractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy with gemcitabine achieves favorable toxicity, QOL , and preliminary efficacy compared with historic al data. Mellon et al. (2015) conducted a single -center case series analysis to evaluate outcomes and toxicity of induction chemotherapy and SBRT for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) and locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). The center' s internal database was queried to identify all patients who received at least one dose of induction chemotherapy and SBRT for the treatment of BRPC or LAPC. After staging, medically fit patients underwent chemotherapy for 2 -3 months, with regimen at the d iscretion of the treating medical oncologist. Then, patients received SBRT delivered in five consecutive daily fractions with median total radiation doses of 30 Gy to tumor and 40 Gy dose painted to tumor -vessel interfaces. That was followed by restaging imaging for possible resection. Outcomes included OS, event free survival (EFS), and locoregional control (LRC) rates. A total of 159 patients, 110 with BRPC and 49 with LAPC, with median follow -up of 14.0 months were included in the analysis. The resection and margin negative (R0) rate for BRPC patients who completed neoadjuvant therapy was 51% and 96%, respectively. Estimated median OS was 19.2 months for BRPC patients and 15.0 months for LAPC patients (p = 0.402). Median OS was 34.2 months for surgically resected patients versus 14.0 months for unresected patients (p < 0.001). Five of 21 (24%) patients with LAPC received FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy underwent R0 patients with LAPC, FOLFIRINOX recipients underwent R0 resection more often than ot her chemotherapy recipients (5 of 21 vs. 0 of 28, p = 0.011). There was a trend for improved survival in patients with LAPC who underwent resection (p = 0.09). For those not undergoing resection, 1 -year LRC was 78%. Any grade 3 potentially radiation -related toxicity rate was 7%. The authors concluded that their results underscore the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of neoadjuvant SBRT and chemotherapy for BRPC and LAPC. Chuong et al. (2013) conducted a single -center, retrospective, case series analysis to evaluate outcomes of patients with nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer and treated with induction chemotherapy followed by SBRT. SBRT was delivered over five consecutive fra ctions using a dose painting technique including 7 -10 Gy/fraction to the region of vessel abutment or encasement and 5 -6 Gy/fraction to the remainder of the tumor. Restaging scans were performed at four weeks, and resectable Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 16 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. patients were considered for resection. The primary endpoints were OS and PFS. A total of 73 patients were evaluated, with a median follow -up of 10.5 months. Median doses of 35 Gy and 25 Gy were delivered to the region of vessel involvement and the remainder of the tumor, respectively. Thirty -two BRPC patients (56.1%) underwent surgery, with 31 undergoing an R0 resection (96.9%). The median OS, 1 -year OS, median PFS, and 1 -year PFS for BRPC vs. LAPC patients was 16.4 months vs. 15 months, 72.2% vs. 68.1%, 9.7 vs. 9.8 months, and 42.8% vs . 41%, respectively (all p > 0.10). BRPC patients who underwent R0 resection had improved median OS (19.3 vs. 12.3 months; p = 0.03), 1 -year OS (84.2% vs. 58.3%; p = 0.03), and 1- year PFS (56.5% vs. 25.0%; p < 0.0001), respectively, compared with all nonsu rgical patients. The 1 -year LC in nonsurgical patients was 81%. There was no acute grade 3 toxicity, and late grade 3 toxicity was minimal (5.3%). The authors concluded that SBRT safely facilitates margin -negative resection in patients with BRPC pancre atic cancer while maintaining a high rate of LC in unresectable patients, and these data support the expanded implementation of SBRT for pancreatic cancer. Rajagopalan et al. (2013) conducted a single -center case series analysis to report outcomes of pati ents with BRPC and LAPC who underwent surgery after neoadjuvant SBRT. Patients were treated with SBRT followed by resection and chemotherapy was to the discretion of the medical oncologist and preceded SBRT for most patients. A total of 12 patients were in cluded in the analysis. Most (92%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and gemcitabine/capecitabine was most frequently prescribed (n = 7). Most patients were treated with fractionated SBRT to 36 Gy/3 fractions (n = 7) and the remainder with single fraction to 24 Gy (n = 5). No grade 3 + acute toxicities attributable to SBRT were found. Two patients developed post- surgical vascular complications and one died secondary to this. The mean time to surgery after SBRT was 3.3 months. An R0 resection was performed in 92% of patients (n = 11/12). In 25% (n = 3/12) of patients, a complete pathologic response was achieved, and an additional 16.7% (n = 2/12) demonstrated < 10% viable tumor cells. Kaplan -Meier estimated median progression free survival is 27.4 months. OS was 92%, 64% and 51% at 1- , 2-, and 3 -years. The authors concluded that in patients with BRPC and LAPC, treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and SBRT followed by resection is safe and tolerated well, and a promising area for further explorati on in this disease site. Mahadevan et al. (2011) conducted single -center, retrospective, case series analysis to evaluate outcomes of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who received a planned strategy of initial chemotherapy with restaging a nd then, for those patients with no evidence of metastatic progression, treatment with SBRT. Patients received GEM (1,000 mg/m 2 per week for 3 weeks then 1 week off) until tolerance, at least six cycles, or progression. Patients without metastases after tw o cycles were treated with SBRT (tolerance -based dose of 24 -36 Gy in three fractions) between the third and fourth cycles without interrupting the chemotherapy cycles. A total of 47 patients were included in the analysis. Of those, 8 (17%) patients were f ound to have metastatic disease after two cycles of GEM; the remaining 39 patients received SBRT. The median follow -up for survivors was 21 months (range, six to 36 months). The median OS for all patients who received SBRT was 20 months, and the median PFS was 15 months. The LC rate was 85% (33 of 39 patients); and 54% of patients (21 of 39) developed metastases. Late Grade III toxicities such as GI bleeding and obstruction were observed in 9% (3/39) of patients. The authors concluded that for patients with locally advanced pancreas cancer, their strategy uses local therapy for those who are most likely to benefit from it and spares those patients with early metastatic progression from treatment, and SBRT delivers such local therapy safe ly with minimal interr uption to systemic chemotherapy, thereby potentially improving the outcome in these patients. Koong et al. (2004) conducted a phase I dose escalation study to determine the feasibility and toxicity of delivering SRS to patients with LAPC. Patients with EC OG performance status 2 received a single fraction of RS consisting of either 15 Gy, 20 Gy, or 25 Gy to the primary tumor. Acute gastrointestinal toxicity was scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. Response to treatment was de termined by serial high -resolution computed tomography scanning. A total of 15 patients were treated at the 3 dose levels ( three patients received 15 Gy, five patients received 20 Gy, and seven patients received 25 Gy). At those doses, no grade 3 or higher acute gastrointestinal toxicity was observed. This trial was stopped before any dose -limiting toxicity was reached, because the clinical objective of LC was achieved in all six evaluable patients treated at 25 Gy. The authors concluded that it is feasible to deliver SRS to patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, and the recommended dose to achieve LC without significant acute gastrointestinal toxicity is 25 Gy. Clinical Practice Guidelines National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) The NCCN gu ideline for pancreatic adenocarcinoma states that as first -line therapy, SBRT may be used in select patients with locally advanced disease without systematic metastases or those who are not candidates for combination therapy. As second - line therapy, SBRT m ay be used if not previously given and if the primary site is the sole site of progression (202 2).

Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. Definitive Treatment of Prostate Cancer without Evidence of Distant Metastasis Jackson et al. (2019) conducted a systematic review and meta -analysis to eval uated physician - and patient -reported outcomes after prostate SBRT. A search was conducted using Medline and EMBASE for original articles published between January 1990 and January 2018. The primary endpoints included 5 -year overall biochemical recurrence -free survival (bRFS), physician - reported acute and late grade 3 toxicity for both genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) domains, and patient -reported QOL using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC). Secondary analyses included a meta -regression of the impact of covariables on bRFS and late toxicity. A total of 38 studies were included in the analysis, comprising 6,116 patien ts. Twenty -two studies were clinical trials, of which 1 was a phase I trial that included 45 patients, four were phase 1/II trials that included 245 patients, 17 were phase II or III trials that included 2,174 patients and 16 were prospective observational stud ies, that included 3,652 patients. The median follow -up period was 39 months (range, 12 to 115 months). Nin ety-two percent, 78%, and 38% of studies included low, intermediate, and high -risk patients, respectively. Overall, 5 - and 7 -year bRFS rates were 95.3% (95% CI, (95% Estimated late grade geni tourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity rates 1.1% 2.0%), respectively. By two years post-SBRT, EPIC urinary and bowel domain scores returned to baseline. Increasing dose of SBRT was associated with improved biochemical control (p = 0.018) but worse late grade 3 GU toxicity (p = 0.014). The authors concluded that prostate SBRT has substantial prospective evidence supporting its use as a standard treatment option, with favorable tumor control, patient -reported QOL , and levels of toxicity. Widmark et al. (2019) conducted a multi -center, phase III, randomized, open -label non -inferiority trial to show that ultra - hypofractionation is non -inferior to conventional fractionation regarding failure -free survival without any significant differences in late normal tissue complications. Participants were men up to 75 years of age with histologically verified intermediate -to-high- risk prostate cancer and WHO performance status between 0 - 2. Patients were randomly as signed to ultra -hypofractionation (42.7 Gy in seven fractions, three days per week for 2.5 weeks) or conventional fractionated radiotherapy (78.0 Gy in 39 fractions, five days per week for eight weeks). No androgen deprivation therapy was allowed. The primary endpoint was time to biochemical or clinical failure. The prespecified non -inferiority margin was 4% at five years, corresponding to a critical HR limit of 1.338. Physician -recorded toxicity was measured according to the RTOG morbidity scale and patient -reported outcome measurements with the Prostate Cancer Symptom Scale (PCSS) questionnaire. A total of 1,200 patients were randomly assigned to conventional fractionation (n = 602) or ultra -hypofractionation (n = 598), of whom 1,180 (591 conventional fractionation and 589 ultra- hypofractionation) constituted the per -protocol population. Eighty -nine percent (n = 1,054) of participants were intermediate risk and 11% (n = 126) were high risk. Media n follow -up time was 5.0 years (IQR 3.1 to 7.0). The estimated failure -free survival at five years was 84% (95% CI 80 to 87) in both treatment groups, with an adjusted HR of 1.002 (95% CI 0.758 to 1.325; p = 0.99). There was weak evidence of an increased f requency of physician -reported acute RTOG grade 2 or worse urinary toxicity in the ultra -hypofractionation group at end of radiotherapy (158 [28%] of 569 patients vs. 132 [23%] of 578 patients; p = 0.057). There were no significant differences in grade 2 o r worse urinary or bowel late toxicity between the two treatment groups at any point after radiotherapy, except for an increase in urinary toxicity in the ultra - hypofractionation group compared to the conventional fractionation group at 1 -year follow -up (3 2 [6%] of 528 patients vs. 13 [2%] of 529 patients; (p = 0.0037). There were observed no differences between groups in frequencies at 5 years of RTOG grade 2 or worse urinary toxicity and bowel toxicity. Patient -reported outcomes revealed significantly hig her levels of acute urinary and bowel symptoms in the ultra -hypofractionation group compared with the conventional fractionation group but no significant increases in late symptoms were found, except for increased urinary symptoms at 1 -year follow -up, cons istent with the physician -evaluated toxicity. The authors concluded that ultra -hypofractionated radiotherapy is non -inferior to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for intermediate -to-high risk prostate cancer as it relates to failure -free survival an d therefore, their results support the use of ultra -hypofractionation for radiotherapy of prostate cancer. Clinical Practice Guidelines American Urological Association (AUA)/ American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) The 2022 AUA/ASTRO guideline for localized prostate cancer strongly recommends utilization of dose escalation when EBRT is the primary treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Additionally, clinicians should utilize available target localization, normal tissue avoidance, simulation, advanced treatment planning/delivery, and image -guidance procedures to optimize the therapeutic ratio of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) delivered for prostate cancer. This guideline was also endorsed b y the Society of Urologic Oncology (Eastham et al., 2022). Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 18 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) The NCCN guideline for prostate cancer states that SBRT is acceptable in practices with appropriate technology, physics, and clinical expertise (2022). Extracranial Oligometastatic Disease Marvaso et al. (2021) conducted a systemic review and meta -analysis to better define the role of SBRT in patients with oligorecurrent prostate cancer. All prospective studies including prostate cancer patients with nodal and/or bone oligometastases and one to five lesions were considered eligible. Six studies published between 2013 and 2020 were included in the review . Data from 445 patients, of which 396 received SBRT (67 in randomized studies and 329 in observational studies) were incorporated . Five studies considered local PFS and reported values close to 100%, one study reported a value of 80% in the observational arm. Benefit in terms of biochemical PFS brought by SBRT was appar ent in all stu dies. The difference in cumulative probabilities between the comparator arm and the interventional arm was maintained after 24 months from baseline. All studies but one considered toxicity among the endpoints of interest. Most events were classified as either G1 or G2, and the only G 3 adverse event was report ed in one trial. The authors concluded that SBRT i s safe and has an almost non existent toxicity risk that makes it the perfect candidate for the optimal management of prostate cancer oligometastatic patients. A limitation of the study noted by the authors is the absence of a control group comparing SBRT with an active treatment. (Ost et al., 2018, which was previously cited in this policy, was included in this systematic review and meta -analysis). Palma et al. (2020) reported extended outcomes (greater tha n 40 months after completion of accrual) from the Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for the Comprehensive Treatment of Oligometastases (SABR The SABR -COMET trial -center, randomized, phase II, open -label, randomized trial to asses s standard of care palliative treatments with or without SABR in patients with a controlled primary tumor and up to five metastatic lesions (Palma 2012). Eligible patients were randomized to either standard of care palliative treatments (control group) or standard of care plus SABR to all sites of metastatic disease (SABR group). The control group received radiotherapy that was delivered according to the standard principles of palliative radiation. The recommended treatment fractionations depended upon the tumor location and indication, and prescribed doses ranged from 8 Gy in one fraction to 30 Gy in ten fractions. The SABR group received stereotactic radiation to all sites of metastatic disease, with the goal of achieving disease control while minimizing p otential toxicities. The allowable doses ranged from 30 -60 Gy in three to eight fractions, depending upon target size and location. Patients were seen every three months after randomization for the first two years, and every six months thereafter. A total of 99 patients were enrolled at ten centers; 33 were randomly assigned to the control group and 66 to the SABR group. The primary tumor types were breast (n = 18), lung (n = 18), colorectal (n = 18), prostate (n = 16), and other (n = 29). Ninety -three percent (92/99) of the patients had one to three metastases. In the initial report (Palma 2019), the use of SABR demonstrated a 13 -month improvement in median OS after a median follow -up of 28 months. In the subsequent report of extended outcomes, the median follow -up period was 51 months (95% CI, 46 to 58 months). The primary outcome event, death (all cause), occurred in 24 (73%) of 33 patients in the control group and 35 (53%) of 66 patients in the SABR group. The median OS was 28 months (95% CI, 19 to 33) in the control group versus 41 months (26 -not reached) in the SABR group (HR, 0.57, 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.10; p = 0.090). The 5 -year OS rate was 17.7% in the control group (95% CI, 6% to 34%) 42.3% in CI, to 56%; p = 0.006). The 5- year PFS rate was not reached in the control group (3.2%; 95% CI, 0% to 14% at 4 years with last patient censored) and 17.3% in the SABR group (95% CI, 8% to 30%; p = 0.001). There were no new grade 2 -5 adverse events and no differences in Q OL between arms. The authors concluded that with extended follow -up, patients with controlled primary tumors and one to five oligometastases who received SABR demonstrated a 22 -month improvement in median OS compared with patients who received a standard -of-care approach alone, corresponding to an absolute survival benefit of 25% at five years. Furthermore, they reported that there were no new safety concerns detected during the extended follow -up period. In 2019, Gomez et al., reported extended outcomes f rom a previously published multi- center, phase II, randomized controlled trial. The original study (Gomez 2016) evaluated PFS after aggressive local consolidative therapy (LCT) versus maintenance therapy or observation (MT/O) for patients with stage IV NSC LC with 3 metastases remaining after front line systemic therapy. That trial was closed early after it demonstrated an 8 -month benefit in PFS for patients who received LCT compared to patients who received MT/O; the median PFS was 11.9 months in the LCT arm (90% CI, 5.72 to 20.90 months) versus 3.9 months in the MT/O arm (p = 0.005). The extended outcomes included PFS, OS, toxicity, and the appearance of new lesions. A total of 49 patients (LCT arm, n = 25; No LCT arm, n = 24) were included in this analys is. The median follow -up time was 38.8 months (range, 28.3 to 61.4 months), the PFS benefit was durable (median, 14.2 months [95% CI, 7.4 to 23.1 months] with LCT vs . 4.4 months [95% CI, 2.2 to 8.3 months] with MT/O; p = 0.022). There was an OS benefit in the LCT arm (median, 41.2 months [95% CI, 18.9 months to not reached] vs. 17.0 months [95% CI, 10.1 to 39.8 months] with MT/O; p = 0.017). No additional grade 3 or Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 19 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. greater toxicities were observed. Survival after progression was longer in the LCT arm (37.6 months with LCT vs. 9.4 months with MT/O; p = 0.034). Of the 20 patients who experienced progression in the MT/O arm, nine received LCT to all lesions after progression, and the median OS was 17 months (95% CI, 7.8 months to not reached). The authors conc luded that in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC that did not progress after front- line systemic therapy, LCT prolonged PFS and OS compared to MT/O. Iyengar et al. (2018) conducted a single -center, phase II, randomized trial to determine if noninvasive s tereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAbR) prior to maintenance chemotherapy patients with non- progressive limited metastatic NSCLC after induction therapy led to significant improvements in PFS. Patients were eligible if they were 18 years or older, had a KPS score of 70 or better, had biopsy -proven metastatic NSCLC (primary plus up to five metastatic sites with no more than three sites in the liver or lung) and the tumors did not possess EGFR -targetable or ALK -targetable mutations but did achieve a parti al response or stable disease after induction chemotherapy. The primary end point was PFS; secondary end points included toxic effects, local and distant tumor control, patterns of failure, and OS. A total of 29 patients ( nine women and 20 men) were enroll ed; 14 patients with a median age of 63.5 years (range, 51.0 -78.0 years) were allocated to the SAbR -plus-maintenance chemotherapy arm, and 15 patients with a median age of 70.0 (range, 51.0 -79.0 years) were allocated to the maintenance chemotherapy -alone a rm. The SAbR -plus-maintenance chemotherapy arm had a median of three metastases (range, 2 -6) and the maintenance chemotherapy -alone arm had a median of two metastases (range, 2 -5). The trial was stopped early after an interim analysis found a significant improvement in PFS in the SAbR -plus-maintenance chemotherapy arm of 9.7 months vs. 3.5 months in the maintenance chemotherapy -alone arm (p = 0.01). Toxic effects were similar in both arms. There were no in -field failures with fewer overall recurrences in th e SAbR arm while those patients receiving maintenance therapy alone had progression at existing sites of disease and distantly. The authors concluded that consolidative SAbR prior to maintenance chemotherapy appeared beneficial, nearly tripling PFS in patients with limited metastatic NSCLC compared with maintenance chemotherapy alone, with no difference in toxic effects. The irradiation prevented local failures in original disease, the mo st likely sites of first recurrence. In addition, PFS for patients wit h limited metastatic disease appears similar PFS in patients with a greater metastatic burden, further supporting the potential benefits of local therapy in limited metastatic settings. In 2017, Ruers et al., published updated outcomes from a previously c onducted a multi -center phase II randomized trial. The original study investigated the possible benefits of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with non -resectable colorectal liver metastases. A total of 119 patients with unresectable colorectal live r metastases (< 10 metastases and no extrahepatic disease) participated in the study. Fifty -nine patients were randomized to systemic treatment alone and 60 patients were randomized to systemic treatment plus aggressive local treatment by radiofrequency ablation \u00b1 resection. The authors reported that the primary end point (30 -month OS > 38%) was met (Ruers 2012). In this updated report, the authors report long -term OS results. At a median follow up of 9.7 years, 92 of 119 (77.3%) patients h ad died: 39 of 60 (65.0%) in the combined modality arm and 53 of 59 (89.8%) in the systemic treatment arm. Almost all patients died of progressive disease (35 patients in the combined modality arm, 49 patients in the systemic treatment arm). There was a st atistically significant difference in OS in favor of the combined modality arm (HR, 0.58, 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.88, p = 0.01). Three -, five -, and eight -year OS were 56.9% (95% CI, to 18.1%), respectively, in the systemic treatment arm. Median OS was 45.6 months (95% CI, 30.3 to 67.8 months) in the combin ed modality arm vs. 40.5 months (95% CI, 27.5 to 47.7 months) in the systemic treatment arm. The authors concluded that this randomized study demonstrated that aggressive local treatment c ould prolong OS in patients with unresectable colorectal liver metas tases. Mokhles et al. (2016) conducted a systematic review and meta -analysis to evaluate evidence on the clinical effectiveness of intensive follow -up after curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer. The primary outcome was the OS difference between the existing monitoring strategy compared with a more intensive monitoring strategy (i.e., measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen and/or CT to detect asymptomatic metastatic disease earlier). Searches were conducted using MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, the Cochr ane Library and Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL (EBSCO), PubMed publisher, Google Scholar, LILACS, SciELO and ProQuest for randomized comparisons of increased intensity monitoring compared with a contemporary standard policy after resection of primary color ectal cancer. Among 7,081 publications, there were 22 relevant articles, with 16 randomized comparisons and 11 that included survival data. More intensive monitoring advanced the diagnosis of recurrence by a median of 10 (IQR 5 to 24) months. In 10 of 11 s tudies, there was no demonstrable difference in OS. Seven RCTs, published from 1995 to 2016, randomly assigned 3,325 patients to a monitoring protocol made more intensive by introducing new methods or increasing the frequency of existing follow -up protocol s versus less invasive monitoring. No detectable difference in OS was associated with more intensive monitoring protocols (HR, 0.98, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.11). The authors Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 20 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. concluded that based on pooled data from randomized trials, the anticipated survival bene fit from surgical treatment resulting from earlier detection of metastases has not been achieved. Clinical Practice Guidelines European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology(ESTRO) / American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) An ESTRO/ASTRO consensus document define d oligometastatic disease (OMD) as one to five metastatic lesions, with a controlled primary tumor being optional, but where all metastatic sites must be safely treatable (Lievens et al, 2020) Glomus Jugulare Tumors Ong (2022) perf ormed a systematic review and meta -analysis to evaluate SRS as a treatment for glomus jugulare tumors (GJTs). An online search for articles was executed in March 2019 and the final analysis included 23 studies with a total of 460 patients. Average rates of tinnitus, hearing loss, and lower cranial nerve deficit as presenting symptoms were 56% , 56%, and 42%, respectively. Overall clinical status improvement rate after treatment was 47%. Rates of tinnitus, hearing loss, and low er cranial nerve improvement aft er treatment were 54%, 28%, and 22%, respectively. The mean follow -up time across studies was 47 months (range, 4 -268 months). The aggregate tumor control rate at the time of follow -up was 95%. The authors concluded that the tumor control rate of 95% and 4 7% symptomatic improvement suggests that SRS may be a viable alternative to resection and a suitable treatment for GJTs. The authors recommend future studies to further evaluate the role of SRS in the management of GJTs. Limitations include study heterogen eity and lack of RCTs. Sheehan et al. (2012) conducted a multi -center case series analysis of examine the outcomes of patients with glomus tumors who underwent RS. A total of 134 patient procedures (132 unique patients) were included in the study. Prior resection was performed i n 51 patients, and prior fractionated external beam radiotherapy was performed in six patients. The patients' median age at the time of RS was 59 years. Forty percent had pulsatile tinnitus at the time of RS. The median dose to the tumor marg in was 15 Gy. The median duration of follow -up was 50.5 months (range, five to 220 months). Overall tumor control was achieved in 93% of patients at last follow -up; actuarial tumor control was 88% at five years post radiosurgery . Absence of trigeminal nerve dysfunction at the time of RS (p = 0.001) and higher number of isocenters (p = 0.005) were statistically associated with tumor progression -free tumor survival. Patients demonstrating new or progressive cranial nerve deficits were also likely to demonstrate tumor progr ession (p = 0.002). Pulsatile tinnitus improved in 49% of patients who reported it at presentation. New or progressive cranial nerve deficits were noted in 15% of patients; improvement in preexisting cranial nerve deficits was observed in 11% of patients. None of the patients died as a result of tumor progression. The authors concluded that GKS was a well-tolerated management strategy that provided a high rate of long -term glomus tumor control, symptomatic tinnitus improved in almost one -half of the patient s, and overall neurological status and cranial nerve function were preserved or improved in the majority of patients after RS. Guss et al. (2011) performed a systematic review and meta -analysis regarding management of glomus jugulare with radiosurgery. No limits were set on the date of publication or the duration of follow -up. The studies were determined eligible for inclusion if they were orig inal research studies that reported the results of radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors. Nineteen studies with a total of 335 patients were included in the meta -analysis. Data on 335 glomus jugulare patients were extracted, including 278 who had received gamma knife and 57 who had received linear accelerator (LINAC) or CyberKnife. The results across all studies fou nd 97% of patients achieved tumor control, and 95% of patients achieved clinical control. Eight studies reported a mean or median follow -up time of > 36 months. In these studies, 95% of patients achieved clinical control and 96% achieved tumor control. The gamma knife , LINAC , and CyberKnife technologies all exhibited high rates of tumor and clinical control. Limitations noted include small sample size of the studies and the various treatments received (gamma knife, LINAC, or CyberKnife ). The authors conclud ed that because of its high effectiveness, radiosurgery should be considered for the primary management of glomus jugulare tumors. The authors recommend future prospective studies with larger patient numbers treated with radiosurgery as a primary treatment modality and longer follow -up. Lim et al. (2001) conducted a single -center, retrospective, case series analysis to report their experience with the application of LINAC or CyberKnife modalities for the treatment of glomus jugulare tumors. A total of 13 patients with 16 tumors were inclu ded in this analysis. All patients were treated with frame -based LINAC or CKRS, with doses ranging from 1,400 to 2,700 cGy. Patients were assessed for posttreatment side effects, which included hearing loss, tongue weakness, and vocal hoarseness. The patie nts' most recent magnetic resonance (MR) images were also assessed for changes in tumor size. The median follow -up duration was 41 months and the mean follow -up period was 60 months. All tumors remained stable or Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 21 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. decreased in size on follow -up MR images. A ll patients had stable neurological symptoms, and one experienced transient ipsilateral tongue weakness and hearing loss, both of which subsequently resolved. One patient experienced transient ipsilateral vocal cord paresis; however, that individual had re ceived previous external -beam radiation therapy. The authors concluded that their findings support RS as an effective and safe method of treatment for glomus jugulare tumors and results in low rates of morbidity. Hemangiomas of the Brain Lee et al. (2017) conducted a multi -center case series analysis to review outcome of patients with Cavernous sinus hemangiomas (CSH) and treated with SRS. A total of 31 patients were included in the analysis. Eleven patients had initial microsurgery before SRS, and the oth er 20 patients (64.5%) underwent GKRS as the primary management for their CSH. Median age at the time of RS was 47 years, and 77.4% of patients had cranial nerve dysfunction before SRS. Patients received a median tumor margin dose of 12.6 Gy (range,12 to 19 Gy) at a median isodose of 55%. Tumor regression was confirmed by imaging in all 31 patients, and all patients had greater than 50% reduction in tumor volume at six months post -SRS. None of the patients had delayed tumor growth, new cranial neuropathy, v isual function deterioration, adverse radiation effects, or hypopituitarism after SRS. Twenty -four patients had presented with cranial nerve disorders before SRS, and six (25%) of them had gradual improvement. Four (66.7%) of the six patients with orbital symptoms had symptomatic relief at the last follow -up. The authors concluded that SRS was effective in reducing the volume of CSH and attaining long -term tumor control in all patients at a median of 40 months. The authors also concluded that their experien ce suggests that SRS is a reasonable primary and adjuvant treatment modality for patients diagnosed with CSH. Khan et al. (2009) conducted a single -center case series analysis to evaluate outcomes of patients diagnosed with cavernous sinus or orbital hema ngiomas and treated with SRS. Eight symptomatic patients with hemangiomas who underwent SRS were included in the analysis. The presenting symptoms included headache, orbital pain, diplopia, ptosis, proptosis and impaired visual acuity. The hemangiomas were located in either the cavernous sinus ( seven patients) or the orbit ( one patient). Four patients underwent SRS as primary treatment modality based on clinical and imaging criteria. Four patients had previous microsurgical partial excision or biopsy. The median target volume was 6.8 mL (range, 2.5 to 18 mL). The median prescrip tion dose delivered to the margin was 14.5 Gy (range, 12.5 to 19 Gy). The dose to the optic nerve in all patients was less than 9 Gy (range, 4.5 to 9 Gy). The median follow -up period after SRS was 80 months (range, 40 to 127 months). Six patients had sympt omatic improvement; two patients reported persistent diplopia. Follow -up imaging revealed tumor regression in seven patients and no change in tumor volume in one patient. All the patients improved after SRS. The authors concluded that their experience conf irms that SRS is an effective management strategy for symptomatic intracavernous and intraorbital hemangiomas, and that their study is the first to report long -term safety and efficacy of SRS in this population. Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations (A VMS) Ding et al. (2017) conducted an international multicenter study which analyzed and collected data from patients with Speltzle r- Martin (SM) Grade III AVMs treated with SRS at eight institutions. Cohort inclusion criteria compris ed patients with SM Grad e III AVMs and a minimum follow -up length of 12 months. AVM obliteration, no post -SRS hemorrhage, and no permanently symptomatic radiation -induced changes were defined as an optimal outcome. The SM Grade III AVM cohort comprised 891 patients with a mean ag e of 34 years at the time of SRS. The mean nidus volume, radiosurgical margin dose, and follow -up length were 4.5 cm3 , 20 Gy, and 89 months, respectively. The actuarial obliteration rates at five and 10 years were 63% and 78%, respectively. The annual pos t radiosurgery hemorrhage rate was 1.2%. Symptomatic and permanent radiation -induced changes were observed in 11% and 4% of the patients, respectively. Optimal outcome was achieved in 56% of the patients and was significantly more frequent in cases of unru ptured AVMs (OR 2.3, p < 0.001). The lack of a previous hemorrhage (p = 0.037), absence of previous AVM embolization (p = 0.002), smaller of AVM -associated arterial aneurysms (p = 0.023), and higher margin dose (p < 0.001) were statistically significant independent predictors of optimal outcome in a multivariate analysis. The authors found SRS had an acceptable risk -to-benefit profile and noted better outcomes in small, unruptured SM Grade III AVMs than for large or rupture d SM Grade III nidi. Limitations include the biases of a retrospective study and lack of comparison with other AVM interventions. The authors recommend future prospective trials. Kano et al. (2012) published a series of studies to evaluate outcomes of pat ients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and treated with SRS. The authors performed GKS on a total of 996 patients with AVMs and conducted subgroup analyses based on AVM classification, anatomical location and clinical scenario. Those subgroups inclu ded patients with 1) SM Grade I and II AVMs; 2) repeat RS for 3) basal volumetric large AVMs. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 22 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. To describe the outcomes and risks of repeat S RS for incompletely obliterated cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), a subgroup of 105 patients was analyzed. In this subgroup, the median time after initial SRS was 40.9 months (range, 27.5 to 13 9 months). The median AVM target volume was 6.4 cm3 (range 0.2 -26.3 cm3) at initial SRS but was reduced to 2.3 cm3 (range 0.1-18.2 cm3) at the time of the second procedure. The median margin dose at both initial SRS and repeat SRS was 18 Gy. The actuarial rate of total obliteration by angiography or MR imag ing after repeat SRS was 35%, 68%, 77%, and 80% at three , four, five, and 10 years, respectively. The median time to complete angiographic or MR imaging obliteration after repeat SRS was 39 months. Factors associated with a higher rate of AVM obliteration were smaller residual AVM target volume (p = 0.038) and a volume reduction of 50% or more after the initial procedure (p = 0.014). Seven patients (7%) had a hemorrhage in the interval between initial SRS and repeat SRS. A total of 17 patients (16%) had hemorrhage after repeat SRS and 6 patients died. The cumulative actuarial rates of new AVM hemorrhage after repeat SRS were 1. 9%, 8.1%, and 22.4% at one , two, three , five, and 10 years, respectively, which translate to annual hemorrhage rates of 4.05% and 1.79% of patients developing new post -repeat -SRS hemorrhages per year for years 0 -2 and 2 -10 following repeat SR S. Factors associated with a higher risk of hemorrhage after repeat SRS were a greater number of prior hemorrhages (p = 0.008), larger AVM target volume at initial SRS (p = 0.010), larger target volume at repeat SRS (p = 0.002), initial AVM volume reductio n less than 50% (p = 0.019), and a higher Pollock -Flickinger score (p = 0.010). Symptomatic AREs developed in five patients (4.8%) after initial SRS and in 10 patients (9.5%) after repeat SRS. Prior embolization (p = 0.022) and a higher SM grade (p = 0.004) were significantly associated with higher rates of AREs after repeat SRS. Delayed cyst formation occurred in five patients (4.8%) at a median of 108 months after repeat SRS (range 47 to 184 months). The authors concluded that repeat SRS for incompletely obliterated AVMs increases the eventual obliteration rate. They also concluded that the best results for patients with incompletely obliterate d AVMs were seen in patients with a smaller residual nidus volume and no prior hemorrhages. To describe the long -term outcomes and risks of SRS for AVMs of the basal ganglia and thalamus, a subgroup of 56 patients with basal ganglia and 77 with thalamus AVMs was analyzed. In this series, 113 (85%) of 133 patients had a prior hemorrhage. The median target volume was 2 .7 cm3 (range, 0.1 to 20.7 cm3) and the median margin dose was 20 Gy (range, 15 to 25 Gy). Obliteration of the AVM eventually was documented on MR imaging in 78 patients and on angiography in 63 patients in a median follow -up period of 61 months (range, tw o to 265 months). The actuarial rates documenting total obliteration after RS were 57%, 70%, 72%, and 72% at three , four , five , and 10 years, respectively. Factors associated with a higher rate of AVM obliteration included AVMs located in the basal ganglia , a smaller target volume, a smaller maximum diameter, and a higher margin dose. Fifteen (11%) of 133 patients suffered a hemorrhage during the latency period and seven patients died. The rate of post AVM hemorrhage three , five , and 10 years, respectively. The overall annual hemorrhage rate was 4.7%. When five patients with seven hemorrhages occurring earlier than six months after SRS were removed from this analysis, the annual hemorrhage rate decreased to 2.7%. Larger volume AVMs had a higher risk of hemorrhage after SRS. Permanent neurological deficits due to AREs developed in six patients (4.5%), and in one patient a delayed cyst developed 56 months after SRS. No patient died of AREs. Factors associated with a higher risk of symptomatic AREs were larger target volume, larger maximum diameter, lower margin dose, and a higher Pollock -Flickinger score. The authors concl uded that SRS is a gradually effective and relatively safe management option for deep -seated AVMs in the basal ganglia and thalamus and that patients remain at risk during the latency interval between SRS and obliteration. In addition, they concluded that the best candidates for SRS are patients with smaller volume AVMs located in the basal ganglia. To describe the long -term outcomes and risks of SRS for AVMs of the medulla, pons, and midbrain, a subgroup of 56 patients was analyzed. In this series, 51 pat ients (76%) had a prior hemorrhage. The median target volume was 1.4 cm 3 (range, 0.1 to 13.4 cm3). The median margin dose was 20 Gy (range, 14 to 25.6 Gy). Obliteration of the AVMs was documented in 35 patients at a median follow -up of 73 months (range, six to 269 months). The actuarial rates of documentation of total obliteration were 41%, 70%, 70%, and 76% at three , four, five , and 10 years, respectively. Higher rates of AVM obliteration were associated only with a higher margin dose. Four patients (6%) s uffered a hemorrhage during the latency period, and two patients died. The rate of AVM hemorrhage after SRS was 3.0%, 3.0%, and 5.8% at one , five , and 10 years, respectively. The overall annual hemorrhage rate was 1.9%. Permanent neurological deficits due to AREs developed in seven patients (10%) after SRS, and a delayed cyst developed in two patients (3%). One patient died with symptoms of AREs and unrecognized hydrocephalus. Higher 12 -Gy volumes and higher S M grades were associated with a higher risk of s ymptomatic AREs. Ten of 22 patients who had ocular dysfunction before SRS had improvement, nine were unchanged, and three were worse due to AREs. Eight of 14 patients who had hemiparesis before SRS improved, five were unchanged, and one was worse. The auth ors concluded that although hemorrhage after obliteration did not occur in their series, patients remained at risk during the latency interval u ntil obliteration occurred, and that 38% of the patients who had neurological deficits due to prior hemorrhage i mproved. In addition, they concluded that higher dose delivery in association with conformal and highly selective SRS is required for safe and effective RS.

Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. To describe the long -term outcomes and risks of AVM management using two or more stages of SRS for symptomatic large - volume lesions unsuitable for surgery, a subgroup of 47 patients was analyzed. In this series, 18 patients (38%) had a prior hemorrhage and 21 patients (45%) underwent prior embolization. The median interval between the first -stage SRS an d the second -stage SRS was 4.9 months (range, 2.8 to 13.8 months). The median target volume was 11.5 cm3 (range, 4.0 to 26 cm3) in the first -stage SRS and 9.5 cm3 in the second -stage SRS. The median margin dose was 16 Gy (range, 13 to 18 Gy) for both stage s. In 17 patients, AVM obliteration was confirmed after two to four SRS procedures at a median follow -up of 87 months (range, 0.4 to 209 months). Five patients had near -total obliteration (volume reduction > 75% but residual AVM). The actuarial rates of to tal obliteration after 2 -stage SRS were 7%, 20%, 28%, and 36% at three , four, five, and 10 years, respectively. The 5 - year total obliteration rate after the initial staged volumetric SRS with a margin dose of 17 Gy or more was 62% (p = 0.001). Sixteen pati ents underwent additional SRS at a median interval of 61 months (range, 33 to 113 months) after the initial 2 -stage SRS. The overall rates of total obliteration after staged and repeat SRS were 18%, 45%, and 56% at five, seven , and 10 years, respectively. Ten patients sustained hemorrhage after staged SRS, and five of these patients died. Three of 16 patients who underwent repeat SRS sustained hemorrhage after the procedure and died. Based on Kaplan -Meier analysis (excluding the second hemorrhage in the pat ient who had two hemorrhages), the cumulative rates of AVM hemorrhage after SRS were 8.6%, 13.5%, and 36.0% at one , two , five, and 10 years, respectively. This corresponded to annual hemorrhage risks of 4.3%, 2.3%, and 5.6% for years 0 - 1, 1 - 5, and 5 -10 after SRS. Multiple hemorrhages before SRS correlated with a significantly higher risk of hemorrhage after SRS. Symptomatic ( AREs) were detected in 13% of patients, but no patient died as a result of an adverse radiation effect. Delayed cyst formation did not occur in any patient after SRS. The authors concluded that prospecti ve volume -staged SRS for patients with large AVMs and unsuitable for surgery has potential benefit but often requires more than two procedures to complete the obliteration process. The authors also concluded that to have a reasonable chance of benefit, the minimum margin dose should be 17 Gy or greater, depe nding on the AVM location, and that prospective volume -staged SRS followed by embolization (to reduce flow, obliterate fistulas, and occlude associated aneurysms) may improve obliteration results and further reduce the risk of hemorrhage after SRS. Murray and Brau (2011) conducted a single -center, retrospective, case series analysis to describe a 10 -year experience in the use of RS for patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). All patients were treated by the first author, and demographi c, clinical and radiographic data were obtained from retrospective chart review. A total of 83 patients were treated and 86 RS procedures for AVMs were performed during a 10 -year period. Eight patients were lost to follow -up. The remaining 75 patients included 36 males and 39 females with a median age of 34.5 years. Hemorrhage was the initial presentation in 40% of patients. Fifty-seven AVMs (73%) were treated previously with endovascular neurosurgery, without success. The median volume of the malformation was 17.7 ml . Almost 65% of the malformations were considered large ( 10 ml) in volume. Forty patients had AVMs with largest diameter 3.5 cm3. The overall obliteration rate was 56.4%, and the median time for obliteration was 29 months. The AVMs 3.5 cm3 in diamete r had a greater latency period than those < 3.5 cm3 (31 months vs. 46 months, respectively; p = 0.01). In addition, AVM obliteration was inversely associated with its volume, especially in large lesions (p = 0.037). Patients achieving obliteration had lowe r SM scores compared with patients in whom obliteration was not achieved (p = 0.009). Post radiosurgery hemorrhages were seen in nine cases. Eleven patients underwent surgery after RS. Major neurological deficits developed in nine patients, whereas 17 had only minor deficits. The occurrence of neurological deficits was significantly associated with lesions with volume 10 ml. The authors concluded that RS is a reasonable treatment option for AVMs in the majority of cases, in spite of large, difficult -to-treat malformations. Maruyama et al. (2005) conducted single -center, retrospective, case series analysis to evaluate the risk of hemorrhage after RS for AVMs. Patients with malformations who were treated with RS with the use of a gamma knife were included i n the analysis. The rates of hemorrhage were assessed during three periods: before RS, between RS and the angiographic documentation of obliteration of the malformation (latency period), and after angiographic obliteration. A total of 500 patients were inc luded in the analysis. Forty -two hemorrhages were documented before RS (median follow -up, 0.4 year), 23 during the latency period (median follow -up, 2.0 years), and six after obliteration (median follow -up, 5.4 years). As compared with the period between diagnosis and RS, the risk of hemorrhage decreased by 54 percent during the latency period (HR, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 0.80; p = 0.006) and by 88 percent after obliteration (HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.29; p < 0.001). The risk was signi ficantly reduced during the period after obliteration, as compared with the latency period (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.68; p = 0.006). The reduction was greater among patients who presented with hemorrhage than among those without hemorrhage at presentati on and similar in analyses that considered the delay in confirming obliteration by means of angiography, and analyses that excluded data obtained during the first year after diagnosis. The authors concluded that RS significantly decreases the risk of hemor rhage in patients with cerebral AVMs, even before there is angiographic evidence of obliteration, and the risk of hemorrhage is further reduced, although not eliminated, after obliteration.

Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. Clinical Practice Guidelines International Stereotactic Radiosurgery Society (ISRS) In a 2020 ISRS systematic review and meta -analysis, Graffeo et al. aimed to establish SRS practice guidelines for grade I -II AVMs. Inclusion criteria included publications reporting post -SRS outcomes in 10 grade I -II AVMs with a follo w-up of 24 months. Obliteration and hemorrhage were primary endpoints; secondary outcomes were SM parameters, dosimetric variables and \"excellent\" outcomes which were defined as total obliteration without new post -SRS deficit. Eight studies were chosen for inclu sion representing 1102 AVMs, of which 836 (76%) were grade II. Obliteration was achieved in 884 (80%) at a median of 37 mo; 66 hemorrhages (6%) occurred during a median follow -up of 68 mo. Total obliteration without hemorrhage was achieved in 78%. Of 836 grade II AVMs, SM parameters were reported in 680: 377 were eloquent brain and 178 had deep venous drainage, totaling 555/680 (82%) high -risk SRS -treated grade II AVMs. The authors concluded that SRS appears to be a safe, effective treatmen t for grade I -II AVM and may be considered front -line treatment, especially for lesions in deep or eloquent locations. The authors note a limitations as small sample size and high risk of bias (Graffeo et al., 2020) . Meningioma Sheehan et al. (2014) conducted a multi -center case series analysis to evaluate outcomes of patients with meningiomas and treated with GKRS. At 10 centers, all patients with sellar and/or parasellar meningiomas treated with GKRS were included in t he analys is. Patients were required to have a minimum of six months of imaging and clinical follow -up after GKRS. Factors predictive of new neurological deficits following GKRS were assessed via univariate and multivariate analyses. Kaplan -Meier analysis and Cox mu ltivariate regression analysis were used to assess factors predictive of tumor progression. A total of 763 patients were assessed clinically and with neuroimaging at routine intervals following GKRS. There were 567 females (74.3%) and 196 males (25.7%) wit h a median age of 56 years (range, eight to 90 years). Three hundred fifty -five patients (50.7%) had undergone at least one resection before GKRS, and 3.8% had undergone prior radiation therapy. The median follow -up after GKRS was 66.7 months (range, six to 216 months). At the last follow -up, tumor volumes remained stable or decreased in 90.2% of patients. Actuarial PFS rates at three , five , eight , and 10 years were 98%, 95%, 88%, and 82%, respectively. More than one prior surgery, prior radiation therapy, or a tumor margin dose < 13 Gy significantly increased the likelihood of tumor progression after GKRS. At the last clinical follow -up, 86.2% of patients demonstrated no change or improvement in their neurological condition, whereas 13.8% of patients experi enced symptom progression. New or worsening cranial nerve deficits were seen in 9.6% of patients, with cranial nerve (CN) V being the most adversely affected nerve. Functional improvements in CNs, especial ly in CNs V and VI, were observed in 34% of patient s with preexisting deficits. New or worsened endocrinopathies were demonstrated in 1.6% of patients; hypothyroidism was the most frequent deficiency. Unfavorable outcome with tumor growth and accompanying neurological decline was statistically more likely in patients with larger tumor volumes (p = 0.022) and more than one prior surgery (p = 0.021). The authors concluded that GKRS provides a high rate of tumor control for patients with parasellar or sellar meningiomas, and tumor control is accompanied by neu rological preservation or improvement in most patients. Pollock et al. (2012) conducted a retrospective case series analysis to evaluate patients who had single- fraction SRS for benign intracranial meningiomas to determine factors associated with tumor co ntrol and neurologic complications. A total of 416 patients (304 women/112 men) who had single -fraction SRS for imaging defined (n = 252) or confirmed World Health Organization grade I (n = 164) meningiomas were included in the analysis. Excluded were patients with radiation -induced tumors, multiple meningiomas, NF 2, and previous or concurrent radiotherapy. The majority of the tumors (n = 337; 81%) involved the cranial base or tentorium. The median tumor volume was 7.3 cm 3; the median tumor margin dose was 16 Gy. The median follow -up was 60 months. The disease -specific survival rate was 97% at five years and 94% at 10 years. The 5- and 10 - year local tumor control rate was 96% and 89%, respectively. Male sex (HR, 2.5, p = 0.03), previous surgery (HR, 6.9, p = 0.002) and patients with tumors located in the parasagittal/falx/convexity regions (HR, 2.8, p = 0.02) were negative risk factors for local tumor control. In 45 patients (11%) permanent radiation -related complications developed at a median of nine months after SRS. The 1 - and 5 -year radiation -related complication rate was 6% and 11%, respectively. Risk factors for permanent radiation -related complication rate were increasing tumor volume (HR, 1.05, p = 0.008) and patients with tumors of the parasag ittal/falx/ convexity regions (HR, 3.0, p = 0.005). The authors concluded that single -fraction SRS at the studied dose range provided a high rate of tumor control for patients with benign intracranial meningiomas, and patients with small volume, non operat ed cranial base or tentorial meningiomas had the best outcomes after single -fraction SRS. Santacroce et al. (2012) conducted a multi -center, retrospective, case series analysis to evaluate long -term efficacy and safety of RS for meningiomas. A total of 4, 565 consecutive patients with 5,300 benign meningiomas were included in the analysis. All were treated with GKRS at least five years before assessment for this study. Clinical and imaging data were retrieved from each Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 25 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. center and uniformly entered into a da tabase. Median tumor volume was 4.8 cm\u00b3, and median dose to tumor margin was 14 Gy. All tumors with imaging follow -up < 24 months were excluded. Detailed results from 3,768 meningiomas (71%) were analyzed. Median imaging follow -up was 63 months. The volume of treated tumors decreased in 2,187 lesions (58%), remained unchanged in 1,300 lesions (34.5%), and increased in 281 lesions (7.5%), giving a control rate of 92.5%. Only 84 (2.2%) enlarging tumors required further treatment. Five- and 10 -year PFS rates w ere 95.2% and 88.6%, respectively. Tumor control was higher for imaging defined tumors vs grade I meningiomas (p < 0.001), for female vs male patients ( p < .001), for sporadic vs multiple meningiomas ( p < .001), and for skull base vs convexity tumors (p < 0.001). Permanent morbidity rate was 6.6% at the last follow -up. The authors concluded that RS is a safe and effective method for treating benign meningiomas even in the medium - to long -term. Kondziolka et al. (2008) conducted a case series analysis to ev aluate clinical and imaging outcomes of patients with meningiomas stratified by histological tumor grade. A total of 972 patients with 1,045 intracranial meningiomas managed durin g an 18 -year period were included in the analysis. The series included 70% wo men, 49% of whom had undergone a previous resection and 5% of whom had received previous fractionated radiation therapy. Tumor locations included middle fossa (n = 351), posterior fossa (n = 307), convexity (n = 126), anterior fossa (n = 88), parasagittal region (n = 113), or other (n = 115). The overall control rate for patients with benign meningiomas (World Health Organization Grade I) was 93%. In those without previous histological confirmation (n = 482), tumor control was 97%. However, for patients wit h World Health Organization Grade II and III tumors, tumor control was 50 and 17%, respectively. Delayed resection after RS was necessary in 51 patients (5%) at a mean of 35 months. After 10 years, Grade 1 tumors were controlled in 91% (n = 53); in those w ithout histology, 95% (n = 22) were controlled. None of the patients developed a radiation -induced tumor. The overall morbidity rate was 7.7%. Symptomatic peritumoral imaging changes developed in 4% of the patients at a mean of eight months. The authors co ncluded that SRS provided high rates of tumor growth control or regression in patients with benign meningiomas with low risk, and tha t their study confirms the role of RS as an effective management choice for patients with small to medium -sized symptomatic , newly diagnosed or recurrent meningiomas of the brain. Pineal Gland Tumors Iorio- Morin et al. (2017) conducted a multi -center case series analysis of patients with SRS -treated pineal region tumors to provide reliable histology stratified outcomes. For p atients with at least six months follow -up, baseline data recorded at the time of the first gamma knife procedure were collected including the indication and treatment parameters. Follow -up data were obtained from the medical records. LC was assessed on th e last available MRI before any subsequent treatment of failure and defined as tumor disappearance, tumor regression (volume reduction m > 10%), tumor stability (change in volume, < 10%), or tumor progression (volume increase, > 10%). A total of 70 patient s were treated with a median follow -up of 47 months. Diagnoses were pineocytoma (37%), pineoblastoma (19%), pineal parenchymal prescription dose was 15 Gy at the 50% isodose line. Actuarial LC and survival rates were 81% and 76% at 20 years for pineocytoma, 50% and 56% at five years for pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiat ion, 27% and 48% at five years for pineoblastoma, 33% and 100% at five years for papillary tumor of the pineal region, 80% and 80% at 20 years for germinoma, and 61% and 67% at five years for tumors of unknown histology. New focal neurological deficit, Par inaud syndrome, and hydrocephalus occurred in 9%, 7%, and 3% of cases, respectively. The authors concluded that SRS is a safe modality for the management of pineal region tumors. Its specific role is highly dependent on tumor histology and as such, all efforts should be made to obtain a reliable histologic diagnosis. Kano et al. (2009) conducted a single -center case series analysis of patients with pineal parenchymal tumors and underwent RS. The analysis included a total 20 patients; 13 patients had pineocytoma, five patients had pineoblastoma and two patients had mixed pineal parenchymal tumors. The median RS prescription dose to the tumor margin was 15.0 (range, 12 to 20) Gy. At an average of 54.1 (range, 7.7 to 149.2) months, six patients died and 14 patients were living. The OS after RS was 95.0%, 68.6%, and 51.4% at one , five and 10 years, respectively. Patients with pineocytomas had 1 -, 3- and 5 -year overall survivals of 100%, 92.3% and 92.3%, respectively. In 19 patients who were evaluated with imaging, five (26%) demonstrated complete regression, nine (47%) had partial regression, two (11%) had stable tumors and two (11%) showed local in -field progression. The PFS after SRS for all typ es of pineal parenchymal tumors was 100%, 89.2% and 89.2% at one , three , five years after RS, respectively. The authors concluded that SRS is an effective and safe alternative to the surgical resection of pineocytomas a s well as part of multimodal therapy for more aggressive pineal parenchymal tumors. Hasegawa et al. (2002) conducted retrospective case series analysis of patients with pineal parenchymal tumors and treated with SRS to clarify the role of SRS in conjunction with other surgical, radiation, an d medical approaches. A total of 16 patients Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 26 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. who had undergone RS as the primary or adjuvant treatment for pineal parenchymal tumors were included in the analysis. Ten patients (62.5%) had pineocytomas, two (12.5%) had mixed pineocytoma and pineoblastoma, and four (25%) had pineoblastomas. The mean marginal dose was 15 Gy, and the mean tumor volume was 5.0 cm3. The mean follow -up periods from the time of diagnosis or the time of radiosurgery were 61 and 52 months, respectively. The overall actuarial 2 - and 5 -year survival rates after diagnosis were 75.0% and 66.7%, respectively. In 14 patients who were evaluated with imaging, four (29%) demonstrated complete remission, eight (57%) had partial remission, two (14%) had no change, and no patient had local progr ession. The local tumor control rate (complete remission, partial remission, or no change) was 100%. Five patients died during follow -up. One patient with a pineocytoma and three patients with pineoblastomas died secondary to leptomeningeal or extracranial spread tumor. No cause of death was established for one patient. Two patients developed (AREs) after RS . The authors concluded that SRS is a valuable primary management modality for patients with pineocytomas, and as adjuvant therapy, RS may be used to bo ost local tumor dose during multimodality management of malignant pineal parenchymal tumors. Pituitary Adenoma Kotecha et al. (2020) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis on outcomes and toxicities following SRS for patients (n = 2671) with non -functioning p ituitary adenomas (NFAs). Thirty -five retrospective studies of 10 patients with NFAs, treated between 1971 and 2017 with e ither SRS ( HSRT ) were included . studies (median dose: 15 Gy, range: 5 -35 Gy) and Gy, range: 12-25 Gy, delivered in 3 -5 fractions). The 5 -year random effects LC estimate after SRS was 83.0% (95% CI: 77.0 -88.0%). Hypopituitarism was the most common treatment- related toxicity observed post-SRS, with a random effect estimate of 21.0% (95% CI: 15.0- 27.0%), wh ile visual dysfunction cranial nerve injuries were uncommon (range: 0 -7%). The authors determined SRS is a safe and effective treatment for patients with NFAs and single fraction SRS is associated with long -term (10-year) disease control . The autho rs note that HRST can be used in select patients with NFAs with encouraging short -term results reported; however, mature outcomes are needed before definitive recommendations can be made. (Lee et al., 2014 b, and Sheehan et al., 2013, which were previously cited in this policy, were included in this systematic review and meta -analysis). Starke et al. (2012) conducted a single -center case series analysis of patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas and treated with GKS. A total of 140 patients (56 % were male) with a median age of 51 years (range, 21 to 82 years) were included in the analysis. The mean tumor volume was 5.6 cm3 (range, 0.6 to 35 cm3). Thirteen patients were treated with GKS as primary therapy, and 127 had undergone at least one open resection prior to GKS. Ninety -three patients had a history of hormone therapy prior to GKS. The mean maximal dose of GKS was 38.6 Gy (range, 10 to 70 Gy), the mean marginal dose was 18 Gy (range, 5 to 25 Gy), and the mean number of isocenters was 9.8 (ran ge, 1 to 26). Follow -up evaluations were performed in all 140 patients, ranging from 0.5 to 17 years (mean five years, median 4.2 years). Tumor volume remained stable or decreased in 113 (90%) of 125 patients with available follow -up imaging. Kaplan -Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression free survival at two , five , eight , and 10 years to be 98%, 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, a tumor volume greater than 5 .0 cm3 (HR, 5.0, 95% CI 1.5 to 17.2; p = 0.023) was the only factor predictive of tumor growth. The median time to tumor progression was 14.5 years. Delayed hypopituitarism occurred in 30.3% of patients. No factor was predictive of post -GKS hypopituitarism. A new or worsening cranial nerve deficit occurred in 1 6 (13.7%) of 117 patients. Visual decline was the most common neurological deficit (12.8%), and all patients experiencing visual decline had evidence of tumor progression. In multivariate analysis, a tumor volume greater than 5 .0 cm 3 (OR, 3.7, 95% CI 1.2 t o 11.7; p = 0.025) and pre -GKS hypopituitarism (OR, 7.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 60.8; p = 0.05) were predictive of a new or worsened neurological deficit. The authors concluded that in patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas, GKS confers a high rate of tumor control and a low rate of neurological deficits. Wan et al. (2009) conducted a single -center case series analysis to evaluate outcomes of patients with secretory pituitary adenomas and treated with GKRS. A total of 347 patients with at least 60 mon ths of follow -up data were included in the analysis. In 47 of those patients, some form of prior treatment such as transsphenoidal resection, or craniotomy and resectio n had been conducted. The others were deemed ineligible for microsurgery because of body health or private choice, and GKRS served as the primary treatment modality. Endocrinological, ophthalmological, and neuroradiological responses were evaluated. The mean follow -up period was 67.3 months (range, 60 to 90 months). Late radioreaction was not ed in one patient and consisted of consistent headache. Of the 68 patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone -secreting (ACTH) adenomas, 89.7% showed tumor volume decrease or remain unchanged and 27.9% experienced normalization of hormone level. Of the 176 p atients with prolactinomas, 23.3% had normalization of hormone level and 90.3% showed tumor volume decrease or remain unchanged. Of the 103 patients with growth hormone -secreting (GH) adenomas, 95.1% experienced tumor volume Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 27 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. decrease or remain unchanged an d 36.9% showed normalization of hormone level. The authors concluded that GKRS is safe and effective in treating secretory pituitary adenomas and may serve as a primary treatment method in some or as a salvage treatment in the others however, treatment mus t be tailored to meet the patient's symptoms, tumor location, tumor morphometry, and overall health. The authors also recommend that longer follow -up is required for a more complete assessment of late radioreaction and treatment efficacy Recurrent Gliomas De Maria et al. (2021) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to establish safety and efficacy of Cyber Knife treatment for recurrent WHO grade III and IV, malignant gliomas of the brain. Thirteen studies (n = 398) from 2000 to 2021 were included. The primary outcomes were median OS , median progression -free survival and median time to progression. Complications, local response, and recurrence were secondary outcomes. Overall survival from initial diagnosis and CyberKnife treatment was 22.6 months a nd 8.6 months. Median time to progression and median progression- free survival were 6.7 months and 7.1 months. Median OS from CyberKnife treatment was 8.4 months for WHO grade IV gliomas, compared to 11 months for WHO grade III gliomas. Median OS from Cybe rKnife treatment was 4.4 months for patients who underwent CyberKnife treatment alone, compared to 9.5 months for patients who underwent CyberKnife treatment plus chemotherapy. No correlation was observed between median time to recurrence and median OS from CyberKnife. Rates of acute neurological and acute non -neurological side effects were 3.6% and 13%. Rates of corticosteroid dependency and radiation necrosis were 18.8% and 4.3%. The authors determined that using the CyberKnife System for reirradi ation of recurrent malignant gliomas provided encouraging survival rates. For patients with WHO grade III gliomas and p atien ts who undergo combined treatment with CyberKnife plus chemotherapy, there is a better survival trend. Complication rates were low. The auth ors recommend further research with larger prospective studies. Gigliotti et al. (2018) conducted a case series analysis to evaluate the efficacy of SRS and fractionated stereotactic radiot herapy (fSRT) as salvage therapy for recurrent high -grade glioma, and to examine the overall efficacy of treatment with LINAC -based RS and fractionated radiotherapy. A total of 25 patients aged 23 to 74 years were re -irradiated with LINAC -based SRS and fSRT. Patients were treated to a median dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions. The median OS after (initial) diagnosis was 39 months w ith an ac tuarial 1 -, 3-, and 5 -year OS rates of 88%, 56%, and 30%, respectively. After treatment with SRS or fSRT, the median OS was nine months with an actuarial 1 -year OS rate of 29%. LC, assessed for 28 tumors, after six months was 57%, while LC after one year was 39%. Three patients experienced LF. There was no evidence of toxicity noted after SRS or fSRT throughout the follow -up period. The authors concluded that SRS and fSRT remain a safe, reasonable, effective treatment option for re- irradiation follow ing recurrent glioblastoma, and treatment volume may predict LC in the salvage setting. Sharma et al. (2018) conducted a single -center, retrospective, case series analysis to evaluate the role of SRS in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBMs). Patient s' electronic medical records were retrospectively reviewed to obtain demographic, imaging, and clinical data. OS and PFS from the date of salvage SRS were the primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. A total of 53 patients with rGBM underwent salvag e SRS targeting 75 lesions. The median tumor diameter and volume were 2.55 cm 3 and 3.80 cm3, respectively. The median prescription dose was 18 Gy (range, 12 to 24 Gy) and the homogeneity index was 1.90 (range, 1.11 to 2.02). The median OS after salvage SRS was estimated to be 11.0 months (95% CI 7.1 to 12.2) and the median PFS after salvage SRS was 4.4 months (95% CI 3.7 to 5.0). A Karnofsky performance Scale score 80 was independently associated with longer OS, while small tumor volume (< 15 cm 3) and les s homogeneous treatment plans (homogeneity index > 1.75) were both independently associated with longer OS (p =0.007 and 0.03) and PFS (p = 0.01 and 0.002, respectively). Based on these factors, two prognostic groups were identified for PFS (5.4 vs. 3.2 months), while three were identified for OS (median OS of 15.2 vs. 10.5 vs. 5.2 months). The authors concluded that good performance, smaller tumor volumes, and treatment at higher homogeneity indices were associated with longer OS and/or PFS despite multipl e prior treatments for rGBM, and that for patients with rGBM and those clinical characteristics, SRS is a reasonable salvage treatmen t option. Imber et al. (2017) conducted a single -center, retrospective, case series analysis to identify proper indication s, efficacy, and anticipated complications of SRS for rGBM. Patients with pathologically confirmed glioblastoma/gliosarcoma who received comprehensive or radiosurgical care at the center were included in the analysis. The partitioning deletion/substitution /addition algorithm to identify potential predictor covariate cut points and Kaplan -Meier and proportional hazards modeling to identify factors associated with post -SRS and postdiagnosis survival. A total of 174 patients with glioblastoma (median age, 54.1 years) underwent SRS a median of 8.7 months after initial diagnosis. Seventy -five percent had one treatment target (range, 1 to 6), and median target volume and prescriptions were 7.0 cm 3 (range, 0.3 to 39.0 cm3) and 16.0 Gy (range, 10 to 22 Gy), respecti vely. Median OS was 10.6 months after SRS and 19.1 months after diagnosis. Kaplan -Meier and multivariable modeling revealed that Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 28 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. younger age at SRS, higher prescription dose, and longer interval between original surgery and SRS are significantly associated with improved post -SRS survival. Forty -six patients (26%) underwent salvage craniotomy after SRS, with 63% showing radionecrosis or mixed tumor/necrosis vs 35% showing purely recurrent tumor. The necrosis/mixed group had lower mean isodose prescription compared with the tumor group (16.2 vs. 17.8 Gy; p = 0.003) and larger mean treatment volume (10.0 vs. 5.4 cm3; p = 0.009). The authors concluded that GKRS may benefit a subset of focally recurrent patients, particularly those who are younger with smaller re currences. The authors also stated that higher prescriptions are associated with improved post-SRS survival and do not seem to have greater risk of symptomatic treatment effect. Maranzano et al. (2011) conducted a single -center case series analysis to eva luated long -term outcomes patients with rGBM and re -irradiated with RS or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. A total of 22 patients were treated with RS or fSRT for 24 lesions of recurrent glioblastoma. The male/female ratio was 14:8, median age 55 ye ars (range, 27 to 81), and median KPS 90 (range, 70 to 100). The majority of the cases (77%) was in recursive partitioning analysis classes III or IV RS or fSRT was chosen according to lesion size and location. Median time between primary radiotherapy and r e-irradiation was 9 months. Median doses were 17 Gy and 30 Gy, whereas median cumulative normalized total dose was 141 Gy and 98 Gy for RS and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, respectively. All patients that accepted RS had a cumulative normalized t otal dose of more than 100 Gy, whereas only a few (44%) of fSRT patients had a cumulative normalized total dose exceeding 100 Gy. Median follow -up from re -irradiation was 54 months. At the time of analysis, all patients had died. After re -irradiation, one (4%) lesion was in partial remission, 16 (67%) lesions were stable, and the remaining seven (29%) were in progression. Median duration of response was six months, and median survival from re -irradiation 11 months. Three of 13 (23%) patients that accepted R S developed asymptomatic brain radionecrosis. The cumulative normalized total dose for the three patients was 122 Gy, 124 Gy, and 141 Gy, respectively. In one case, the volume of the lesion was large (14 cc), and in the other two the interval between the f irst and second cycle of radiotherapy was short ( five months). The authors concluded that re -irradiation with RS and fSRT is feasible and effective in recurrent glioblastoma patients, and apart from the importance of an accurate patient selection, cumulati ve radiotherapy dose and a correct indication for RS or fSRT must be considered to avoid brain toxicity. Trigeminal Neuralgia Refractory to Medical Therapy Peciu -Florianu et al. (2020) conducted a systematic review and meta -analysis that focused on trigem inal for meni ngiomas and schwannoma which investigated rates of improvement of trigeminal neuralgia symptoms. Articles published between January 1990 and December 2019 (n = 330) were screened and assessed for eligibility . Ultimately, 20 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and 13 were included in the quantitative synthesis. Pain relief after SRS was reported as Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain intensity scores of BNI I in 50.5% (range 36 -65.1%) of patients and BNI I -IIIb in 83.8% (range 77.8- 89.8%). There was no significant difference in series discussing outcomes for tumor targeting versus t umor and nerve targeting. Recurrences were described in 34.7% (range 21.7 -47.6; tumor targeting). Maintenance of BNI I was reported in 36.4% (range 20.1 -52.7) and BNI I -IIIb in 41.2% (range 29.8- 52.7; tumor targeting series). When both the nerve and the tu mor were targeted, only one series reported 86.7% with BNI I -IIIb at last follow -up. Complications were encountered in 12.6% (range 6.3 -18.8; tumor targeting series) of patients; however, they were much higher, as high as 26.7%, in the only study reporting them after targeting both the nerve and the tumor. Facial numbness was the most common complication . The authors concluded that SRS for trigeminal neuralgia secondary to benign tumors is associated with a favorable clinical course, but less favorable than idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. Among reports and targeted approaches, there was heterogeneity. Targeting both the tumor and the nerve seemed to achieve better long -term results, however, the rate of complications was much higher and the number of patien ts treated was limited. The authors recommend future clinical studies that focus on standard reporting of clinical outcomes and randomization of targeting methods. Tuleasca et al. (2018) conducted a systematic review to provide an objective summary of the published literature specific to the treatment of classical trigeminal neuralgia with radiosurgery ( RS) and to develop consensus guideline recommendations for the use of RS, as endorsed by the International Society of Stereotactic Radiosurgery. A search w as conducted using Embase, PubMed, and Medline databases for articles published between 1951 to 2015 and identified a total of 585 studies. A total of 6 5 studies were included in the review and those included 45 GKS studies (5687 patients), 11 LINAC radios urgery studies (511 patients), and nine CyberKnife radiosurgery( CKR ) studies (263 patients). All but one of the studies were retrospective. The mean maximal doses were 71.1 to 90.1 Gy to 80.5 Gy for CKR (the latter two prescribed at the 80% or 90% isodose lines, respectively). The ranges of maximal doses were as follows: 60 to 97 Gy for GKS, 50 to 90 Gy for LINAC, and 66 to 90 Gy for CKR. Actuarial initial freedom from pain (FFP) wit hout medication ranged from 28.6% to 100% 40% to 72% (mean 56.3%, median 58%) for CKR. Specific to hypesthesia, the crude rates (all Barrow Neurological In stitute Pain Intensity Scale scores included) ranged from 0% to 68.8% (mean 21.7%, median 19%) for Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 29 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. GKS, from 11.4% to 49.7% (mean 27.6%, median 11.8% to 51.2% (mean 29.1%, 18.7%) for CKR. Other complications included thesias, dry eye, deafferentation pain, and keratitis. Hypesthesia and paresthesia occurred as complications only when the anterior retrogasserian portion of the trigeminal nerve was targeted, whereas the other listed complications occurred when the root entry zone was targeted. Recurrence rates ranged from 0% to 52.2% (mean 24.6%, median 23%) 15.8% 33% (mean 25.8%, median 27.2%) for CKR. Two GKS series reported 30% and 4 5.3% of patients who were pain free without medication at 10 years. The authors concluded that although the literature is limited in its level of evidence, at present, one can conclude that RS is a safe and effective therapy for drug -resistant trigeminal n euralgia and based on this information consensus statements have been made. Clinical Practice Guidelines National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence (NICE) A NICE guideline (2022) on SRS and trigeminal neuralgia states th at safety and efficacy is ad equate to support using this procedure provided that standard arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent, and audit. A multidisciplinary team experienced in the management of trigeminal neuralgia should be utilized for patient selection , and the procedure should only be performed in specialized centers. Uveal Melanoma In a systematic review and meta -analysis, Parker et al. (2020) evaluated the clinical outcomes of patients with uveal melanomas or intraocular metastases treated with GKS . The primary outcomes analyzed were local tumor control and tumor regression. Fifty-two studies were eligible for systematic review, 1010 patients had uveal m elanoma and three with intraocular metastasis. The authors found that 840 of 898 patients (0\u00b796, 95% CI 0\u00b794- 0\u00b797; I2 = 16%) from 19 of 478 patients (0\u00b781, 0\u00b770- 0\u00b790; I2 = 83%) from 16 studies experienced tumor regression. The autho rs concluded GKRS is an effective primary method of treating uveal melanomas and intraocular metastases, with reliable tumor control rates and a similar efficacy and survival profile to outcomes for plaque brachytherapy and charged particle therapy. The au thors recommend future research focusing on generating level 1 evidence (RCTs) of the efficacy of GKRS in treating ocular tumors, measuring overall complication rates of GKRS , providing consistent reporting of visual acuity measurements after GKRS , and eva luating low -dose regimens to reduce radiation -induced side -effects and subsequent vision loss. Yazici et al. (2017) conducted a multi- center, retrospective, case series analysis to evaluate treatment outcomes of patients with uveal melanoma and treated wi th SRS or fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT). Treatment was administered with CyberKnife. Primary endpoints were local recurrence- free survival (LRFS) and enucleation -free (EFS). distant metast asis-free survival (DMFS), visual acuity (VA), and late treatment toxicity. LC was defined as the lack of tumor progression (i.e., an increase in tumor volume). Complete response was defined as the disappearance of the tumor, and partial response as a > 50% decrease in the tumor volume. A total of 181 patients (182 uveal melanomas) who underwent SRS/FSRT were included in the analysis. The median patient age was 54 years (range, 18 to 82 years) and 104 (58%) were male. The median tumor diameter and thickness was 10 mm (range, 2 to 12 mm) and 8.0 mm (range, 1.5 to 18 mm), respectively. According to Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study criteria, tumor size was small in 1%, medium in 49.5%, and large in 49.5% of the patients. Seventy -one tumors received < 45 Gy, and 111 received 45 Gy. Median follow -up time was 24 months (range, 2 to 79 months). Complete and partial response was observed in eight and 104 eyes, respectively. The rate of 5 -year OS was 98%, DFS 57%, LRFS 73%, ificant correlation between tumor size and DFS , SRS/FSRT dose and EFS; and both were prognostic for LRFS. Enucleation was performed in 41 eyes owing to progression in 26 and complications in 11. The authors concluded that using SRS/FSRT, better control of large tumors was achieved with 45 Gy in three fractions. They also recommend increasing the radiation dose, as well as limiting the maximum eye and lens dose to 50 Gy and 15 Gy, respectively, to increase the eye retention rate, and that additional studie s with longer follow -up should be conducted. Dieckmann et al. (2003) conducted a case series analysis to evaluate local tumor control and radiogenic side effects after fractionated LINAC based - SRS for uveal melanoma. A total of 90 patients with uveal mel anoma and treated at a LINAC with 6 MV were included in the analysis. The head was immobilized with a modified stereotactic frame system (BrainLAB). For stabilization of the eye position a light source was integrated into the mask system in front of the he althy or the diseased eye. A mini- video camera was used for on -line eye movement control. Tumors included in the study were either located unfavorably with respect to macula and optical disc (< 3 mm distance) or presented with a thickness > 7.0 mm. Median tumor volume was 305+/ -234 mm 3 (range, 70 to 1,430 mm3), and mean tumor height was 5.4+/ -2.3 mm (range, 2.7 to 15.9 mm). Total doses of 70 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Page 30 of 36 UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy Effective 04/01/2023 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 3 United HealthCare Services, Inc. (single dose 14 Gy @ 80% isodose) or 60 Gy (single dose 12 Gy @ 80% isodose) were applied in five fractions within 10 days. The first fractionation results in total dose (TD) (2 Gy) of 175 Gy for tumor and 238 Gy for normal tissue, corresponding val ues for the second fractionation schedule are 135 and 180 Gy, respectively. After a median follow -up of 20 months ( range, 1 to 48 months) LC was achieved in 98% (n = 88). The mean relative tumor reductions were 24%, 27%, and 37% after 12, 24 and 36 months. Three patients (3.3%) developed metastases. Secondary enucleation was performed in seven patients (7.7%). Long term side effects were retinopathy (25.5%), neuropathy (20%), fractionated LINAC based stereotactic photon beam therapy in conjunction with a dedicated eye movement control system is a highly effective method to treat unfavorably located uveal melanoma, and that total doses of 60 Gy (single dose 12 Gy) are considered to be sufficient to achieve good local tumor control. Clinical Practice Guidelines National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) The NCCN guideline for uveal melanoma states SRS i s the least ofte n used form of definitive radiotherapy of primary or recurrent intraocular tumors. SRS planning, fiducial marker use and tumor localization are generally consistent with particle beam therapy approaches (NCCN, 2022).
