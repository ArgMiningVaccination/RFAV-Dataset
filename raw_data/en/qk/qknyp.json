The Public Accounts consis t of the annual report of the Government of Alberta and the annual reports of each of the 21 ministries. The annual report of the Governmen t of Alberta contains the con solidated financial statements of the province and the Measuring Up report, which compares actual performance results to desired re sults set out in the government's strategic plan. This annual report of the Ministr y of Energy contains the finan cial information of the ministry and a comparison of actual performance results to desired results s et out in the ministry business plan. This ministry annual report also includes: the financial statements of e ntities making up the ministry including the Department of Energy, the Alberta Energy Regul ator, the Alberta Utilities Com mission, the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission, the Post-closure Stewardship Fund, and th e Balancing Pool. other financial information as required by the Financial Administration Act and Fiscal Planning and Transparency Act , as separate reports, to the extent that the ministry has anything to report; and financial information relating to trust funds. In December 2018, government anno unced changes to the 2018-19 m inistry annual reports. Ministry and department audited financial statements previously included in the annual report of the Ministry of Energy have been replaced with t he financial information of the ministry on pages 71-175. Key information previously cont ained in the annual reports of e ach of the 21 ministries is now included in the audited consolidated financ ial statements of the provinc e. Introduction 6 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Message from the Minister As a life-long Albertan, I am deeply honored to have the privil ege to serve as the Minister of Energy. Alberta is once again open for business and our government is d edicated to building upon the province's track record of being a place wh ere entrepreneurs thrive, parti cularly in the energy sector. It should be noted that informa tion contained in the 2018-2019 Energy Annual Report reflects decisions made prior to the new government's swearing in on April 30, 201 9. We should be proud of our energy s ector. Alberta has the third- largest reserves of r ecoverable oil in the world and the fourth-l argest reserves of natural gas. Yet, in r ecent years, prices have dropped, growth has stalled and we have witness ed a capital flight from Alberta , costing us\u2014and the country\u2014billions in revenue. Even worse, much needed pipeline projects like Norther n Gateway and Energy East were cancelled and abandoned. But there is good news. The energy industry in Alberta can agai n be one of the most a ttractive investment destinations in North America. W e're doing this through a multi -faceted approach. First, we are fighting for pipelines. This includes the Trans M ountain Expansion Pipeline project, Keystone XL and Enbridge's Line 3. We will work with stakeholders, inclu ding First Nations coalitions, to get shovels in the ground. The Canadi an Taxpayers Federation estima tes that the federal government has already lost $12 billion because of a lack of pipeline capacity . We intend to change that. We will also continuously fight the federal government when it comes to unfa ir legislation, as we have seen with Bill C-69 and Bill C-48. Second, we are restoring invest or confidence by making sure Alb erta is the best place to do business. Our government is working to cut red tape and reduce unnecessar y and redundant regulations that have been hindering business growth. We are using an outcome-based a pproach to ensure regulatory processes are necessary, effect ive, efficient and proportional to the results they are trying to achieve. Next, we will build upon our repu tation as a wor ld leader in re sponsible energy production. Alberta has some of the world's highest envir onmental, human rights and lab our standards when it comes to energy development. We need to do a bette r job telling the world about these achievements\u2014and a better job at uncovering foreign-funded misinformation campaigns working to s abotage our industry. To that end, our government will be creating an elit e team to dispel myths and l ies about the energy industry and tell Alberta's story. Introduction Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 7 We are also standing up for Alberta 's natural gas industry. The re will be a growing global demand for natural gas in the coming deca des, and our government will work with regulators and industry to streamline project approvals and get full value for this import ant resource. We will wor k to ensure we have the infrastructure we need to s hip Alberta's natural gas to int ernational markets. Finally, we are focused on ensur ing Albertans have a stable and reliable electricity system. Our electricity grid is the foundation of our lives, and we need to ensure all Albertans can count on a stable, dependable system whether at home or at wor k. Our plan ensures Alberta has a market-based electricity system that welcomes a diversity of sources while providing affordable elec tricity to everyone in the province. Regardless of decisions made in the past, as a new government w e look forward to imp lement our plans to create jobs, stimulate private sector investment and get our energy industry working for Albertans, while maintaining the highest env ironmental and safety standard s. We will continue to stand up for Alberta and protect the val ue of our energy exports.

The ministry st rives to ensure sustai ned prosperity in the interests of Albertans through the stewardship of energy and mi neral resources. Sustained prosperity includes having regard for the social, economic and environment al impacts of Alberta's energy development. The ministry consists of the De partment of Energy, the Alberta Energy Regulator, t he Alberta Utilities Commission, the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission, the Pos tclosure Stewardship Fund and the Balancing Pool. Each entity play s an important role in overseei ng the orderly development of Alberta's energy resources. The outcomes in Energy 's 201821 Business Plan are: Albertans benefit economically from responsible energy and min eral development and access to global markets. Effective stewardship and regul ation of Alberta's energy and m ineral resources. Albertans benefit from a stable , reliable electricity system t hat protects consumers, attracts investment, and has improved environmental performance. The shortage of export infrastructure such as pipelines and tid ewater ports for acce ss to new markets and consumers has a direct influence on Alberta's oil and gas indus try. Without adequate export capacity to move Alberta's products to U.S. refineries and to new global ma rkets, the value that the province can obtain for its oil and gas resour ces is limited. Without a dive rsified market base, fa ctors such as future U.S. oil and gas production and t he U.S.-Canadian dollar exchan ge rate can also influence the overall economic benefit derived from resource development in the provi nce. In addition, the oil and gas industry in particular is susceptible to geopolitical uncertainty and co mmodity price volatility , which has a direct impact on Alberta's industry and in turn, investment and employ ment, and the overall economy. The oil and gas industry is a t the heart of Alberta's economy. Regulation of energy and mineral development requires a balanced and integrat ed approach that ta kes into consideration the range of social, economic and environmental factors which are constantly evolving. Regulatory burden and uncertainty at the federal level can hinder investment in the p rovince's resource indu stry, and ultimately impact the economic benefits deriv ed from resource development activities.

Energy development also drives activity in a number of other industries, including constructio n and manufacturing, which benefit communities across Alberta and Canada. Non -Renewable Resource Revenue Generated The department is responsible for collecting non-renewable reso urce revenue on behalf of Albertans. Royalties are payments to Albertans for Crown-owned resources t hat are produced and sold. Albertans, as owners, collect value from our resources through royalties, bonuses and lease rentals. Developing Alberta's resources r equires a working relationship between the province and energy companies. The price received and t he costs involved in produci ng and selling those resources affect the value available for royalties. The following table is a compari son of budgeted and actual revenues generated for fiscal year 2018-19 . Non-renewable resource reven ues totaled $5.4 billion, $1.6 billion higher than the budgeted amount of $3.8 billion. 2018-19 Non-Renewable Resource Revenue $5.4 Billion Results Analysis 16 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Non-Renewable Resource Revenue Forecasting The Government of Alberta is responsible for forecasting non-re newable resource revenues. Non-renewable revenue forecasts are based on economic condition s at the time of the forecast, anticipated economic growth, non- renewable resource demand tren ds and expected supply levels. Commonly, the most influential fa ctor affecting non-renewable r esource revenue is commodity prices. Other factors such as capital and operati ng costs, the U.S.- Ca nadian dollar exchange rate and production also affect royalty revenues. Unanticipated changes in these factors could result in significant differences between the budget fore cast and the actual results. The Government of Alberta models the complex system to calculat e royalties and forecast non-renewable resource revenue. To develop pric e forecasts, the government us es a number of industry consultants and the futures market as well as a d eep analysis of global, North American and Alberta market fundamentals. The non-renewable resource revenue forecast can change frequent ly throughout the year as new price, cost and production forecasts ar e issued. When the market is ch anging rapidly, price outlooks are frequently updated and the government incorporates the futures market to reflect those rapid developments in a timely manner. Changes in production forecast s and other variables such as industry costs and investments are also incorporated into each quarterly update. Commodity Prices and Trends Commodity Prices 2018-19 Budget 2018-19 Actual WTI (Cdn$/GJ) 2.00 1.34 Sources : Government of Alberta; U.S. Energy Information Administration Note: WCS data is reported in Canadian currency in the Government of Alberta budget documents. To allow for comparisons with other price data in this annual r eport, WCS has been converted to U.S. currency. Conversions m ay differ slightly, depending on the treatment of exchange rates. Oil Prices The oil price difference is affected by differences in crude qu ality between light sweet and heavy sour oils, location, market demand, and by a ccess to markets for these pro ducts. Alberta is l andlocked and exports both light and heavy crude oil. H owever, the majority of Albert a's oil production growth and oil exports is from heavy crude, for which price per barrel is discounted from light sweet prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is the North American price bench mark for light sweet oil. Western Canadian Select (WCS) is a North American price benchmark for h eavy crude oil, commonly used to price Canadian heavy oil. The WTI price averaged almost U S$93 per barrel in the four fisc al years from 2010-11 to 2013-14, but then declined by approximately 70 per cent from about US$105 pe r barrel in June 2014 to around US$30 Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 17 per barrel in February 2016. The de cline in WTI price was due t o a combination of factors, from global supply growth exceeding demand growth, with supply boosted by s ignificant increases, including increases from North American production, continuing increases in global inventories, and demand muted by a slowdown in developing econom ies. WTI prices increased fro m US$45.00 per barrel in 2015-16 to US$47.94 per barrel in 2016-17 a s the Organization of the Petro leum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members and several non-OPEC producers continued to limit produ ction after agreeing in late 2016 to reduce output by 1.8 million barre ls per day, commencing in 201 7. Following the momentum that started in the second half of 2017, WTI pri ces increased to US$53.69 pe r barrel in 2017-18. Budget 2018 was based on an esti mate of US$59.00 per barrel pri ce for WTI crude oil and an exchange rate of 80 cents U.S. to the Ca nadian dollar i n 2018-19. The ac tual WTI price averaged US$62.73 per barrel in 2018-19. WTI prices continued to trend upward in the 2018-19 fiscal year until October 2018 as global crude supply significantly exceeded demand, leading to a n increase in global crude inventory. OPEC and non-OPEC production cu t agreement was extended again i n December 2018 until June 2019. This agreement, together with U.S . sanctions on Venezuela, supp orted crude prices in early 2019 with WTI posting monthly increases and reaching US$58.17 per barrel in March 2019, the highest monthly level since October 2018. Most analysts are forecasting that WT I prices will be supported by the OPEC and non-OPEC supply compliance, and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, but restrained by expanding U.S. shale production pr ompted by the higher prices. Crude Oil Prices Source: Ministry of Energy The WCS price was estimated at US$36.65 per barrel for 2018-19 in Budget 2018. A combination of factors such as persistent gl obal oversupply, continuing build- ups in global inventories, and concerns over demand growth put significant dow nward pressure on prices; howe ver, once global prices start to recover, WCS generally improves as well. The WCS price saw a co nsiderable decline from an average of almost US$73 per barrel during t he 2010-11 to 2013-14 fiscal ye ar period to US$31.60 per barrel in 2015-16. Since then, the WCS pric e experienced some recovery, a veraging US$34.01 per barrel in 2016-17 and US$39.29 per barrel in 2017-18. The ongoing supply growth in Western Canada, constrained take away capacity, and the deep U.S. Midwest refin ery turnaround season in 2018 resulted in wider light-heavy differentials in late 2018. The decline in international crude oil prices close to the end of 2018 also pushed the WCS prices to historical lows. WCS pric es started to recover in early 2019 with improving international oil pric es. The WCS price received an a dditional uplift from both the Alberta crude oil curtailment and continued reduction in Venezuelan heavy oil supply due to the U.S. Annual Report 2018-2019 The actual WCS price averaged US$39.46 per barrel in 2018-19, s lightly higher than budgeted price, mainly due to the Alberta crude oil curtailment initiative and the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, which contributed to an increase in global and North American heavy o il prices. The actual price exceeded the budgeted price, despite the declin e in heavy oil prices that to ok place towards the end of 2018 due to oil sands production exceeding ava ilable pipeline capacity, and del ayed response from the crude by rail option. When oil pipelines leaving Canada reach full capacity, Canadian oil prices are discounted to reflect a higher rail transporta tion cost and receive a larger price discount compared to WTI. This reduces royalty revenues received by Al bertans. Nonetheless, as crude o il production from Alberta is exceeding available pipeline capacity, WCS prices are expected to remain low despite a projected increase in global crude oil prices. 2018-19 Crude Oil Prices Sources: Ministry of Energy; U.S. Ener gy Information Administration Natural Gas Prices The Alberta Natural Gas Reference Price (ARP) is used in natura l gas royalty formulas for natural gas royalty revenue calculation. Overall, the general rule of sup ply and demand balance determin es natural gas prices in North America. Storage levels and weather patterns affect prices as it impacts the market's ability to respond to additional demand. Lower storage levels could lead to higher prices and vi ce-versa. Lower than normal temperatures in the winter and higher than normal temperatures in the summer could lead to increased demand and higher prices. Royalties in Budget 2018 were bas ed on a gas price forecast of ARP at Cdn$2.00/gigajoule (GJ). The realized ARP averaged Cdn$1.34/GJ in fiscal year 2018-19. The a ctual gas price was below budgeted levels at the end of the fiscal y ear due to a combination of pi peline maintenance issues, regional surplus from limited outlets to supply , continued U.S. natural gas prod uction growth, robust Canadian production and TC Energy Corporation's restri ction protocol during mainten ance periods on its pipeline systems in Western Canada. 01020304050607080US$/bbl WTI WCS Budget WTI Budget WCS Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 19 2018-19 Alberta Gas Reference Price Source: Government of Alberta Despite other North Am erican benchmark natural gas prices havin g remained relatively flat year-over- year throughout 2018, AECO prices were particularly weak and vo latile due to robust U.S. and Canadian production, as well as infrastruct ure issues combined with rest riction protocol during maintenance periods on TC Energy Corporation's Nova Gas Transmission Ltd (NGTL) pip eline system in Western Canada. The combined impact led AECO pr ices to be heavily discounted an d volatile to other North American benchmark prices in the summer and fall of 2018. Alberta Gas Reference Prices Source: Government of Alberta 00.511.522.5Cdn$/GJ Production Crude Bitumen Production Crude bitumen production incre ased by about 7.5 per cent from 2 .83 million barrels per day in 2017 to 3.05 million barrels per day in 2018, and therefore continued a rising trend that has been underway since 2008. This was the first time that the annual crude bitumen pro duction in Alberta exceeded three million barrels per day. Total crude bit umen production is comprised of mined production and in-situ production. During 2018, mined production in creased by about 15.4 per cent to 1.47 million barrels per day, mainly due to an increase in production from Suncor Energy's Fort Hill s mine, Imperial Oil's Kearl mine, and Canadian Natural Resources Limited's Horizon and Athabasca Oil Sands Project mines. In addition, a number of in-situ projects cont inued to ramp up production in 2 018, leading to an overall in-situ production increase of abou t one per cent to 1.57 million barre ls per day. The share of crude bitumen production as a percentage of global consumption also increased in 2018, to 3.1 per c ent from 2.9 per cent in 2017. Alberta Crude Bitumen Production Source: Alberta Energy Regulator Conventional Crude Oil and Equivalent Production Production of crude oil and equi valent (condensate and pentanes plus) increased by about 13 per cent, from about 715,800 barrels per d ay in 2017 to about 808,300 bar rels per day in 2018. Conventional production increas ed by almost 10 per cent from 20 17 to 2018, from about 446,100 barrels per day to about 489,600 barrel s per day. According to the Albe rta Energy Regulator , higher crude oil prices in 2018 combined with bot h an increase in initial well p roductivity and slower decline rates led to increased production for the se cond straight year. Producers ar e increasingly commercializing low permeability areas with large volu mes of light crude oil, such as the Montney and Duvernay Formations because of the price premium on light oil. The increase in cond ensate and pentanes plus production continued in 2018; the production went up by about 18 per cent from 269,700 barrels per day in 2017 to 318,800 barrels per day in 2018. 2.302.53 2.542.833.05 0.000.501.001.502.002.503.003.50 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Million barrels per day Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 21 Alberta Conventional Crude and Equivalent Production Source: Alberta Energy Regulator Natural Gas Production From 2017 to 2018, marketable natural gas production remained a lmost unchanged, with a 0.01 billion cubic feet per day increase fr om 10.35 billion cubic feet per d ay in 2017 to 10.36 billion cubic feet per day in 2018. Production levels obser ved in 2018 were consistent wit h the trend over the past few years. Natural gas production has been resilient due to increased dril ling for liquids due to solid demand for condensate. Natural gas product ion from liquids-rich formations is forecast to continue to account for more than half of the natural gas production in the province.

Upstream energy investment in Alberta consists o f mining, quarrying, convention al oil and gas inve stment, oil sands investment, as well as support act ivities. Alberta has to compe te for investment with other oil and gas producing jurisdictions to ensure continuous development of its energy industry. This has been more of a challenge following the signific ant decline in oil prices that took place in late 2014. The oil price decline in late 2014 has not prevented the total mining, quarrying, and oi l and gas extraction sector investment in Alberta in 2014 from setting an a ll-time Alberta record at $61 billion. However, the price decline has impacted the industry since then. In 2015, Al berta experienced a significant decline in investment in this sector, down to $40.3 billion, o r a 34 per cent year-over-year decline. Investment in the sector has remained below 2014 levels in the years since. If the 2018 preliminary actual result of $28.2 billion material izes, investment in Alberta's mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector would be the lowest since 200 9, when investment in the sector was $21.9 billion. However, 2018 prelim inary actuals from Statistic s Canada may be revised, since industry activity in the province actua lly increased in 2018 as oil pric es increased from the pr ior year. The actual results for 2018 is expected to be released in 2020. The chart below, with the data for the 2014 to 2018 period, dem onstrates the importance of Alberta's energy industry investment wit hin the Canadian context. Capital Investment in Alberta Mining, Quarrying and Oil & Gas Extraction Sector Preliminary % of Canadian InvestmentBillion Cdn$ Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 23 Although the investment in the mining, quarrying, and oil and g as extraction industry in Alberta was down substantially from the 2014 level , Alberta still attracted more investment in this indust ry than all of the rest of Canada combined. In 2018, Alber ta's investment in the upstre am energy industry is estimated to have accounted for 59 per cent of the Canadian investment in this in dustry. The 2017 results that are reported in the present Annual Report have been revised from the preliminary actuals for 2017 reported in the 2017-18 Annual Report to refle ct actual results released by Statistics Canada. The upstream energy industry investment in Alberta for 2017 was $29.4 billi on, accounting for 58 per cent of Canadian producti on; these results supersede the preliminary actual results that were reported in the 2017-18 Annual Report. Drilling The chart below presents drilling activity in Alberta over the 2014 to 2018 period. Wells drilled include both development and exploratory wells. As seen in the chart, a fter the significant decline in the total number of wells drilled in Alber ta that occurred in 2015 and 20 16, drilling activity increased in 2017. In 2018, the number of crude oil and bi tumen wells continued to in crease relative to the 2017 level, while the number of natural gas wells declined. The total successful natural gas wells drilled decreased by 28 per cent, from 1,295 in 2017 to 937 in 2018. Although the low gas price environment created challenges for the natural gas sector in 2018, newer and higher productivity we lls in the Foothills Front Regi on sustained raw gas production. Conversely, the total successful crude oil wells drilled increa sed by 20 per cent, from 1,831 in 2017 to 2,194 in 2018. Stronger oil prices encouraged more drilling act ivity in 2018, especially with light oil and natural gas liquids in the Mont ney and Duvernay formations. New wells continue to become more efficient in terms of drilling times, cos ts, and production rates. Many o f the advancements in oil drilling can be applied to gas production, including the use of horizontal mult istage fracturing and more fracturing stages per leg. Bitumen wells drilled followed a similar trend to crud e oils, increasing by 16 per cent from 1,309 in 2017 to 1,515 in 2018.

Over the 2016-2018 period, th e number of metres dr illed for crude oil and bitumen wells are demonstrating more horizontal drilling an d multistage fractured wells and an increase on drilling activity beyond that shown by just the num ber of wells. Wells Metres Drilled Source: Alberta Energy Regulator Employment Upstream energy sector employm ent has been important to the eco nomic performance of Alberta. The 2014 decline in oil prices had a major impact on employment in Alberta's mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector. Over the 2014 to 2016 period, direct emp loyment in this sector in Alberta declined by about 23 per cent, from 175,00 0 to 136,000 people. However, in 2017, employment in the upstream energy sector increased by thr ee per cent from the 2016 level t o 140,000 people. From 2017 to 2018, employment in this sector wen t up by a further five per cent to 147,000 people. When indirect employment in the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction is taken into account, Alberta's total employment in the sector increased from about 4 23,000 people in 2017 to approximately 444,000 people in 2018; total dire ct and indirect employment in the sector in 2018 c orresponded to about 19 per cent of total employmen t in Alberta in 2018. In the case of employment in mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction, an example o f the direct employment impact is an oil rig worker; indirect impact would include an employee who works a t the power station which suppli es the oil rig with electricity. The indirect employment results reported for the 2015 to 2017 p eriod have been retroactively revised in this annual report from what was reported in t he 2017-18 Annual Report to reflect a more current multiplier from Statistics Canad a. This revision has resulted i n a substantial upward revision of indirect employment results for this period. - 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Metres drilled (Thousand) Natural Gas Wells Crude Oil Wells Bitumen Wells Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 25 Employment in the Mining, Quarr ying and Oil & Gas Extraction Se ctor Source: Statistics Canada Note: Totals may not add up precisely due to rounding. 155136 140 147313 273282297 050100150200250300350400450500 2015 2016 2017 2018Thousand Direct Employment Indirect Employment Results Analysis 26 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Royalty Programs The Government of Al berta owns 81 per cent of oil and gas resou rces in Alberta and collects royalties from companies when an oil or gas well or oil sands project is in production. On behalf of Albertans, the ministry reviews and maintains a competitive and effective roya lty regime that attracts industry investment, which provides jobs , business opportunities, tax an d royalty revenue and numerous other benefits to the provincial econo my. This work supports outcome one from Energy's 2018-21 Business Plan: Albertans benefit from r esponsible energy and mineral dev elopment and access to global markets. Royalty programs exist for a number of reasons, such as: to provide appropriate royalty structure to attract investment in Alberta's energy sector in specific situations where the ov erall regime needs adjustment t o achieve strategic investments; to encourage the development, use and commercialization of inno vative technologies to produce resources; and to achieve certain strategic po licy objectives such as increase d value-added upgrading. This section presents program re sults for the department's roya lty programs for the 2017 calendar year, as well as the royalty adjustment s for crude oil, natural gas a nd by-products for the 2018-19 fiscal year. While the program results and roya lty adjustments are related, each royalty revenue adjustment needs to be interpreted in its own unique context. These numbers are gen erated using different data sources and methodologies, and are for different purposes, and, as such, ar e not directly comparable. It is important to keep in mind that: The actual royalty revenues are revenues the Crown collects on production from all wells in the province and are reported in the financial statements on a fiscal-year basis. Royalty adjustment refers to the amount by which royalty was re duced from what would have been assessed under the generic roya lty formulas due to a parti cular royalty program. The royalty adjustments are for we lls that qualified under the roya lty programs and are reported in the financial statements on a fiscal-year basis. The total royalty revenue of eac h royalty program is sourced fr om various royalty reporting systems for crude oil, natural gas and oil sands. These systems are reported on a calendar- year basis and reflect the amendm ents filed by industry each ye ar. Amendments can be filed for up to three years from the production month. In addition, t he total royalty revenue of each royalty program reflects the re venue from wells that are qualif ied for the respective royalty programs in a given year. It does not represent the net revenue from those wells as the royalty revenue on natural gas a nd gas products can be further reduced by eligible deductions, such as the Gas Cost Allowance. Most of the royalty programs prov ide royalty adjustments early in the life cycle of the well or project while revenues from wells participati ng in the program occur during t he entire production life of a well. Therefore, comparing the royalt y adjustments against the royalt y revenue is only rele vant when done over the life of each well or projec t and should take into account, as far as possible, the value of investments that would not have been made without the program. Two royalty frameworks current ly run programs in Alberta, the M odernized Royalty Framework and the Alberta Royalty Framework. Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 27 Modernized Royalty Framework Royalty Programs The Modernized Royalty Framework creates harmonized royalty for mulas for crude oil, liquids and natural gas based investment and encoura ges industry to reduce costs. I n 2017, the departmen t established two new programs under the Modernized Royalty Framework: the Enhanc ed Hydrocarbon Recovery Program and the Emerging Resources Program. Enhanced Hydrocarbon Recovery Program This program came into effect on January 1, 2017 and replaces t he Enhanced Oil Recovery Program that is being phased out. The objectives of the Enhanced Hyd rocarbon Recovery Program are to: provide appropriate royalty treat ment for incremental hydrocarb on production to account for the higher costs associated wit h enhanced recovery methods; generate incremental hydrocarbon production through enhanced hy drocarbon development; and collect incremental royalty rev enue for Alberta over the long-t erm. Alberta is encouraging the use o f enhanced recovery methods for petroleum and natural gas through the Enhanced Hydrocarbon Recovery P rogram. This program aims to con serve the province's resources by targeting different recovery met hods that use fluid injection s uch as hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, nitrogen or chemicals. During the 2018 calendar year, the Enhanced Hydrocarbon Recover y Program received 11 applications. In total, 21 applications from 15 companies have been received since the program's inception. Two applications for secondary recovery of oil, which includes enha ncing the recovery of oil from an oil pool by water flooding, gas cycling, gas flooding, polymer flooding or similar methods, were approved during the 2018 calendar year. Benefit schedules were finaliz ed in November, 2018 and applicat ions are being processed in accordance with that schedule. The first year of production under the prog ram occurred in 2018. This production performance will be re ported in next year's annual report. Emerging Resources Program The Emerging Resources Program c ame into effect on January 1, 2 017. This program encourages industry to develop new oil and ga s resources in higher-risk an d higher-cost areas that have large resource potential. The objective s of the Emerging Resources Pr ogram are to: provide appropriate royalty tr eatment for strategic emerging oi l and gas resources that are high cost and high risk; promote innovation and industry ex perience to accelerate the de velopment of these resources; and generate incremental royalty rev enue for Albertans over the lon g-term. Since the program's inception , a total of 17 applications were received from 11 companies that have shown interest in the program . In 2018, the Emerging Resources Program received five applications that are under review. Four applicat ions that were received in 2017 were approved during the 2018 calendar Results Analysis 28 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 year. Final benefit details w ere finalized in September 2018 an d additional applications in review and processing. Revenue and production data for the four applications approved during the 2018 calendar year will be reported in next year 's annual report. Alberta Royalty Framework's Royalty Programs The department has a number of r oyalty programs under the Alber ta Royalty Framework that are no longer accepting new entrants as of 2017 and will be phased out once their regulati on expires. They will be replaced by the Enhanc ed Hydrocarbon Reco very Program and th e Emerging Resources Program, as described above. The programs to be phased out include the Natu ral Gas Deep Dr illing Program, Emerging Resources and Technologies Initiative, Incremental Eth ane Extraction Program and the Enhanced Oil Recovery Program. T he ministry will continue to mo nitor and report on the progress of these programs until they have officially expired. In the 2018-19 fiscal year, 11 royalty programs provided more t han $953.4 million in royalty adjustments to oil and gas producers. Royalty Program 2017-18 Royalty Adjustments ($ Millions) 2018-19 Royalty Adjustments ($ Millions) Natural Gas Deep Drilling Program $1,071.6 $676.8 Shale Gas $199.0 $159.4 Proprietary Waiver $2.3 $15.4 Horizontal Gas $10.3 $6.9 Otherwise Flared Solution Gas $0.2 $0.1 Deep Oil Exploratory Well $0.1 $0.1 Program $0.1 Total Royalty Adjustments $1,455.7 $953.4 Note: totals may not add up due to rounding. Natural Gas Deep Drilling Program The Natural Gas Deep Drilling Program (NGDDP) has been making p rogress towards achieving its intended outcomes of encouraging new exploration and developing production by providing a royalty adjustment to wells with a vert ical depth greater than 2,000 me tres. The royalty adjustment is bas ed on the well's measured depth an d is provided for a period of up to five years following the well's fini shed drilling date. The minimum royalty rate applied to natural gas and natural gas products is five per cent. For condensate, the mini mum adjustment rate is zero. Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 29 The total residue gas production from eligible wells has decrea sed by 12.9 per cent and liquids production has increased by 9.3 per cent. Residue gas is the gas mixture l eft after separation and processing of natural gas liquids that are ready for delivery to the pipeline . The decrease in residue gas production is a result of the low gas price and hi gh natural gas liquids prices , which incents liquid rich production and deeper cut natural gas processi ng. This price environment is th e result of high localized demand for pentanes plus, a mix of natural g as liquids used as diluent, mi xed with bitumen to reduce viscosity and allow the resulting dilbit blend to be shipped on pipelines. Prior Year's Results Current 2017 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total gas production from eligible wells Residue Gas: million $280 million $261 million $307 millio n Units of measurement for gas is 103m3 and liquids is m3 The total royalty revenue for NG DDP has increased by 17.7 per c ent from the 2016 result. In the 2017 calendar year, gas wells in the program contributed about $307 million in total royalty revenues. Total royalty revenue has increased by over $46 million from 2016, de spite a decrease in gas and an increase in the liquids production from e ligible wells over the same per iod. Higher NGDDP royalty revenue despite decreased gas production is the result of increased liquids pro duction and higher local market prices for liquids, particularly pentane and higher carbon number hydrocar bons, relative to gas. This is mainly due to the high localized demand dr iven by bitumen producers' need for diluent to ship their product. Additionally, natural gas liquid' s reference prices were higher in 2017 than in 2016. NGDDP no longer accepts new wells i nto the program as of Decemb er 31, 2016 and no new wells were drilled since the program is phasing out. The Emerging Resources and Technologies Initiative Introduced in 2010, the purpose of the Emer ging Resources and T echnologies Initiative (ER&T) is to stimulate investment and encourage development of Alberta's unc onventional resources through the deployment of new technologies. The initiative supports new exp loration, development and production from Alberta's emerging resource s in horizontal oil, shale gas, horizontal gas and coalbed methane. The ER&T was implemented to increase investors' ability to recover upfront investments by extending the maximum five per cent New Well Royalty Rate to acknowledge the higher costs and risks associated in the following four situations: hor izontal oil, horizontal gas, shale gas and coalbed methane. No new wells were accepted into the program after December 31, 2016. Results Analysis 30 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Production under the program is m easured for wells in each of t he four situations. In shale gas wells, horizontal gas wells and horizontal oil wells, the production h as decreased significant ly. This is the result of expected production declines in existing wells. In 2017, no new wells qualify fo r the program and production began to decline in exi sting wells. Overall gas prod uction in coalbed methane wells continues on a year-over-year downward trend. Overall production from horizontal oil and gas wells decreased in 2017 compared to 2016. Gas production under the horizontal gas new wells decreased to 4.3 billion cubic metres from 7.6 billion cubic metres in 2016. Liquids producti on also saw a decrease to 2.9 m illion cubic metres from 3.4 million cubic metres in 2016. Horizontal oil wells showed dec reases of 45.6 per cent and 51.5 per cent in 2017 oil production and solution gas production, respectively from 2016 to 2017. Oil pr oduction decreased to 2.4 million cubic metres from 4.5 million cubic metres in 2016. Solution gas prod uction decreased to 0.4 billion cubic metres from 0.9 billion cubic metres in 2017. Solution gas is t he gas that is separated from crude oil or crude bitumen after recovery from a well event. Production from shale gas wells include shale gas, liqui ds, oil and solution gas. Product ion from shale gas wells has decreased since no new wells qualified for the pr ogram in 2017. In the 2017 calendar year, gas production from shale wells decreased to 0.6 billion cubic metres from 0.9 billion cubic metres from 2016 level. The economics of coalbed methane wells continue to be challenging compared to ot her gas wells. Despite relatively low drilling costs, the supply cost for coal bed methane wells are among the highest. Coalbed methane wells produce mainl y dry gas and have very low initial production rates. In addition, coalbed methane wells are typica lly drilled on a single-well ba sis and do not benefit from economies of scale associated with drilling mu ltiple wells at one location. This is commonly used in tight and shale formations. The total royalty revenue for ER &T in 2017 was $238.9 million c ompared to the 2016 total royalty revenue of $125.7 million. This accounts for 14.8 per cent of Alberta's total conventional Crown oil and gas revenues. Total revenue generated by wells in the program has i ncreased by 90.0 per cent compared to 2016, which was an increase of 45.9 per cent from 2015. The sig nificant drop in commodity prices in 2015 and 2016, the expected decli ne of existing wells, and the reduction in new wells qualifying for the program all reduced the qualif ying production from this program . On the other hand, the increase in West Taxes Intermediate (WTI) prices in 2017, which influenced both oil and natural gas liquid prices, increased the value from Emerging Resource and Technologies Ini tiative production, therefore lead to an increase in ER&T royalties. The results for the ER&T only reflect the wells that are qualif ied and receiving program benefits for a given year. As discussed previo usly, the ER&T lowers the royalt y rate for qualified wells at the beginning of a well's production life for a limited time period (up to fo ur years) or a maximum production amount. This is intended to reduce the re turn-on-investm ent time period for owners and to maintain Alberta's competitiveness. Most of these we lls continue to produce and ge nerate additional royalty revenue and other economic benefits for the Crown after they exit the progr am. Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 31 Incremental Ethane Extraction Program Implemented in 2007, the Incremen tal Ethane Extraction Program (IEEP) provides $350 million in royalty credits to petrochemical companies that consume incremental eth ane for the production of higher-value products such as ethylene and it s derivatives. The objective of the IEEP is to supply an additional 60,000 to 85,000 barrels per day of ethane for petrochemical companies to use as feedstock. The program allows for a 60-mon th royalty credit eligibility pe riod. In the 2017-18, 13 of the 16 approved projects were in-service for t he program. These 13 in-service p rojects are capable of providing up to 85,073 barrels per day of additional ethane or about 93 per cen t of the total approved incremental ethane capacity approved by the mini ster. In the 2018-19, the departme nt issued approximately $17.1 million in royalty credits to these pr ojects for 2017 production. About 80 per cent of the increm ental ethane capacity was from n atural gas sources with the remaining 20 per cent obtained from off-gas sources. The supply and demand for ethane has continued to strengthen ov er the past few years and Alberta's petrochemical supply and demand balance is considered stable. T he Department of Energy will continue to process royalty credits ass ociated with in-service ethane ex traction projects that are within their 60-month credit eligibility peri od. The IEEP is being phased ou t and is scheduled to end on December 31, 2021. Enhanced Oil Recovery Program The Enhanced Oil Recovery Progr am (EORP) was implemented in 201 4 and has been making progress towards achieving its intended out comes. This includes encourag ing incremental crude oil production through enhanced oil recovery m ethods. This involves injecting approved materials other than water to increase oil recovery from a pool at existing developments. The program provides a maximum five per cent royalty rate for all oil pr oduced from program-approved sc hemes for a defined period of up to 120 months. The program is intended to encourage increased investme nt in incremental oil production, realize incremental royalty volumes and ul timately increased royalty re venue. No new applications were received in 2017 under this program, a nd no new schemes were approved into the program since the pr ogram is being phased out. Total Crown production from enhan ced oil recovery in 2017 was 0 .7 million cubic metres, which is an increase of 12,793 cubic metres from the previous year. The Cro wn royalty volumes from active EOR schemes totaled 103,927 cubic metres, which translates to about $37.2 million in total royalty revenue in 2017. The total royalty revenue in creased by $13.6 million in 2 017 from the $23.6 million reported in 2016. This can be attributed to the slightly higher oil prices in 2017, as royalty rates are responsive to both production and commodity price under the Alberta Royalty F ramework. Of this total royalty revenue, $34.6 million was considered incr emental royalty to the Crown t hat otherwise would not have been generated without the program. Thi s is a $12.9 million increase from the $21.7 million in incremental royalty revenue reported in 2016. It is important to note that, wi thout the program support, enha nced oil recovery schemes are generally uneconomic and unattractive to investors due to higher producti on costs and lower rates of return on investments. Without the program , the enhanced oil recovery sch emes may not proceed to even produce the base oil production. In tha t regard, any royalty generated from those enhanced oil recovery schemes could be considered 'incremental' to the Crown. Results Analysis 32 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Outcome One Albertans benefit economically f rom responsible energy and mine ral development and access to global markets. The ministry develops and manage s policies and programs related to the province's tenure and royalty system. It accurately calculates a nd collects revenues from ene rgy and mineral royalties, mineral rights leases, bonuses and rent. The mini stry explores ways to encoura ge value-added processing within the province through the diversific ation of the energy resources. T his includes management of its processing and other agreement s respecting bitumen pr ocessing at the Sturg eon Refinery through the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission (APMC). In addition to diversifi cation efforts, the ministry monitors and takes steps to protect the value of Alberta's resources, includ ing temporary mechanisms in 2019 to bring oil production in better alignment with transport capacity. The Ministry of Energy also represents Alberta in intergovernmental initiatives such as the Canadian Energy St rategy and the Energy and Mines Ministers' table to ensure they reflect Alberta's interests. It continues to advocate for increased pipeline access to global markets and addre ss pipeline constraints to st rengthen both provincial and national economies. Key Strategies Achieving optimum value for Albertans in the development of ene rgy and mineral resources is significantly affected by appropr iate market access and energy related infrastructure. Geopolitical uncertainty and commodity price volatility also continue to imp act this risk. Market demand continues to affect this risk and is connected to future United States produ ction capacity and the value of the Canadian dollar. The ministry continued to advocate for increased pipeli ne access to global markets to ensure Alberta gets more value for its pr oducts. The ministry's royalt y programs and energy diversification programs also acted to manage this risk by providing incentives for investment. 1.1 Develop policies and initia tives that support the diversifi cation of energy resource value chains and value-added processing in the province. Energy Diversification Programs In recent years, Alberta energy producers have faced competitio n in the U.S. and central Canadian markets. In order to support long-te rm growth and to optimize v alue for Albertans as resource owners, the province needs to diversify t he markets for its products. Three programs were introduced to add more value to the product s through local processing before they are exported. In 2018-19, t he Ministry of Energy completed the application season for the second round of the Petrochemicals Dive rsification Program (PDP), the Petrochemicals Feedstock Infrastructure Program (PFIP), and collaborated with APMC to implement the Par tial Upgrading Program (PUP), which were announced in March 20 18. These three programs were c reated under the Energy Diversification Act . Petrochemicals Diversification Program (PDP) PDP was originally launched in 2016 to enable construction of n ew and expanding petrochemical facilities in the province by providing ro yalty credits to encourage compa nies to build manufactu ring facilities that turn ethane, methane and propane feedstock into products that h ave more value than the raw materials. These more valuable products inc lude plastics, fabrics and fert ilizers. Under the program, approved projects are issued royalty credits once the facilities become operational. Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 33 When PDP Round One was launched in February 2 016, the province committed $500 million in royalty credits for two projects implem enting value-added processing in Alberta. Two companies were approved under the first round to undertake these projects. PDP Round Two was designed to encourage the construction of new and expanding petrochemical facilities in the province by providing up to $500 million in r oyalty credits. In Nov ember 2018, the funding for the program was in creased to up to $1. 1 billion in royalty credits. The application open season for PDP Round Two closed on October 1, 2018 and to date, two projec ts were approved to receive royalty credits once they are in operation. Inter Pipeline expects to make a final investment decision on i ts $600 million acrylic a cid facility by July 31, 2020 and begin operations by De cember 31, 2022. Nauticol En ergy plans to be in a position to sanction the project by December 31, 2019 and have the facility in-service by June 30, 2022. Partial Upgrading Program (PUP) PUP was designed to encourage com panies to build two to five bi tumen upgrading facilities in Alberta over the next eight years. Partial upgrading reduces the thickn ess of oil sands bitumen so it can flow through pipelines more easily. U pgrading bitumen reduces the am ount of diluent that needs to be added to the bitumen in order to transp ort it by pipeline. This lower s industry costs and allows more of the product to be shipped since there is less diluent in the mix. T his can enhance the co mpetitiveness of Alberta's oil sands industry. P artial upgrading would also enab le more refineries to process Alberta bitumen which can enhance the competitiveness of Alberta's oil sands sector. The application open season began on June 11, 2018 and applicat ions were received for PUP until September 4, 2018. Following the evaluation process, APMC enter ed into a non-binding letter of intent with Value Creations Inc. Petrochemical Feedstocks Infr astructure Program (PFIP) PFIP was created to encourage in dustry to build facilities that supply natural gas liquids feedstock required for petrochemical manufacturing by providing up to $1 billion in grants and loan guarantees to successful project proposals. T his program is intended to encou rage midstream projects that support extraction and supply of natural gas components for feedstock. Feedstocks such as ethane, methane, propane and butane are ingredients used in products like electr onics, plastics, fabric s and fertilizers. Increasing the province's supply of these raw co mponents suppor ts the expansion of Alberta's petrochemical processing sector , expands the market reach inter nationally and capitalizes on increased consumer demand for products in Asia. The Ministry of Energy initiat ed the program in 2018-19 and rec eived applications until October 1, 2018. Results Analysis 34 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Exploring Future Ref ineries in Alberta During 2018-19, the Government of Alberta explored the role of refineries in energy diversification and economic activity in the province. In response to indust ry encouragement, the province issued a Re quest for Expressions of Interest (RFEOI) on December 11, 2018 to determine the business case for investing in a new refinery or related infrastructure in Alberta. The RFEOI submission period cl osed on February 8, 2019. A numbe r of Expressions of Interest were received. Sturgeon Refinery During 2018-19, the APMC prepared for the start-up of the Sturg eon Refinery. Full commercial operations is currently targeted for the end of 2019 due to delays in swit ching the refinery feedstock from synthetic crude oil to bitumen. The APMC's role in the North Wes t Redwater Partner ship (NWRP) i ncludes feedstock provider, toll payer, and subordinated debt lender. APMC is responsible for supplying 75 per cent of the refinery bitumen feedstock, retaining 75 per c ent of the refined products and pa ying 75 per cent of the cost of service toll for processing. The commission has borrowed a to tal of $439 million from Treasu ry Board and Finance to lend to the Sturgeon Refinery. The timelines for the commission repaying th e debt to Treasury Board and Finance corresponds to the NWRP repaym ent of the term loan to the commi While loans to NWRP are outstandi ng, APMC obtains a voting inte rest (25 per cent) of the NWRP Executive Leadership Committee, w hich is in proportion with its contribution to equity. This has provided APMC with some involvement in the refinery's business, but does not extend to control over the construction or engineering. In addition, APMC remained fully e ngaged through participation in the Operations Committee, Operation s Executive Leadership Committee , Health, Safety and Environment Committee and the Finance Committee. APMC also participated in regular commercial steering committee meetings to discuss and assess potential feedstock an d offtake marketing arrangements. APMC continues to participate in the new steering committee to align financial and operational processes for the application of the cos t of service toll outlined in the processing agreements. The most fundamental risk to APMC relating to the Sturgeon Refi nery is that the difference in price between final products (diesel and diluent) and the feedstock ( diluted bitumen) will not be enough to cover the cost of upgrading and re fining the feedstock due to m arket conditions. If there is a narrow differential between bitumen and light oil and products, then t he refinery contract could result in losses. If there is a wide differential, t hen it can result in positive ca sh flow. While this risk cannot be directly managed, part of the value of the arrangement is that it provid es hedging on a small part of Alberta's bitumen. If the differences betwe en bitumen and light oil are w ide, province-wide royalties will be lower but the refinery contract will be more profitable. If the diffe rences are narrow, the refinery contract will be less profitable but royalties w ill be higher. This is a recogni zed cost and benefit of such a physical hedge. The department expects phase 1 of the project to provide positi ve returns for Albert ans. Returns will be affected by commodity prices fo r refined products and feedstock , the potential for a narrow differential between bitumen and lig ht oil and products, fi nal capital cost and timing of full operations. Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 35 1.2 Improve market access for Alberta's energy resources and p roducts by emphasizing Alberta's commitment to reduci ng carbon emissions and fostering and strengthening energy- related relationships nationally and globally. Strengthening Energy-Related Relationships and Promoting Albert a's Interests In 2018-19, the province took a n umber of measur es to protect t he value of its resources, including efforts to diversify the energy industry , manage production, storage, a nd export to get the best value for Alberta's oil and continuing to advocate for pipelines. It is recognized that without more pipelines coming online, Alberta will continue to face the challenge of discounted price s. Sustained advocacy efforts in Canada and the U.S. are key to addressing the co nstraint and getting Alberta's resources to U.S. refineries and new, offshore markets . Throughout 2018-19, the Government of Al berta engaged in a range of activities in Canada and the U.S. to strengt hen energy-related relationshi ps. In June 2018, government attended t he Global Petroleum Show in Calgary, Alberta, June 12-14, 2018, and advanced Alberta's energy priorities through several engage ments with international stakeholders including Cosmo Oil (Japan), Japan Canada Oil Sands Limited, an d the Texas Secretary of State, Rolandos Pablos. In June 2018, government attended t he Energy Council in Regina, Saskatchewan. Government emphasized the importance of energy trade with the U.S. and hig hlighted the value of Alberta's energy sector as a resilient, secure, and desir able place to do busine ss and maintain climate change commitments. Over 60 U.S. elected officials attended the confer ence. In July 2018, government attended the Stampede Investment Forum in Calgary, Alberta. Government advanced relations with American counterparts on U.S. market ac cess through participation in the U.S. Relations Working Group Meeting . In addition, government promot ed investment attraction through meetings with the Kuwait Petro chemical Industries Company, the Canada United Emirates Business Council, and Astomos Energy of Japan. In September 2018, government hoste d the China-Alberta Petroleu m Centre Annual Board Meeting and events in Edmonton, Alberta. The mi nistry leveraged this event to highlight investment opportunities in Alberta as well as the skills of A lberta's environmental servic e companies. In addition, the ministry reinforced Alberta's commitment to wards tidewater market access and desire to market Alberta's energy products in Asia. In September 2018, the ministry, i n collaboration with the Mini stry of Indigenous Relations, Ministry of Environment and Parks and the Mi nistry of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism completed a mission to New York City to lever age Climate Week and promote i nvestor confidence. The Government of Alberta delegation held a number of meetings with investment fi rms and climate change representatives from the Government of Canada as well as the United Nations. Th e delegation also hosted a dinner reception to highlight Alberta 's commitment to responsible ener gy development. In March 2019, government completed a mission to Houston, Texas to attend CERAWeek 2019 and conduct bilateral meetings. The ministry highlighted the value of market access through engaging a number of American pipeline opera tors to seek opportunities to transport Alberta crude. In addition, the ministry highlighted investment attraction through engaging wit h a number of liquefied natural gas and electricity generation firms to highlight investment potential in Alberta. Results Analysis 36 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Alberta's support of pipeline infr astructure and market access is crucial to the province's energy industry and overall economy. The Government of Alberta will continue to advocate and work through regulatory processes and legal challenges until additional pipelines come online. Bill 12: Preserving Canada's Economic Prosperity Act The province's economy experienced growth in 2017 and 2018, and it is important to ensure that this growth continues through getting the best value for the provinc e's resources. In May 2018, Bill 12: Preserving Canada's Economic Prosperity Act was passed to ensure that A lbertans receive maximum value for the province's natural resources. This act gives government the authority to require companies to obtain a licence before exporting energy products including natural gas, crude oil, and refined fuels su ch as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from Alberta via pipeline, rail or t ruck. This enables government to ensure that adequate pipeline capacity is available to maximize the return on resources, and better manag e supply and stor age of resources. Production Curtailment During 2018, Alberta production began to exceed local market de mand and the capacity of pipelines and available rail (\"takeaway capaci ty\") to take oil to other marke ts. Two major cross-border pipeli ne projects - Keystone XL and the Line 3 Replacement Project - continued to be delayed as well as Trans Mountain. In order to better match anticipat ed production with capacity, in December 2018, the Government of Alberta put in place a temporary limit on industry-wide oil pro duction that took effect in January 2019. Production limits bega n in January 2019, and were set at the fo llowing levels: 3.56 million barrels per day (bbl/d) for January 3.635 million bbl/d for February and March 3.66 million bbl/d for April 3.685 million bbl/d for May Announced 3.71 million bbl/d for June Trans Mountain Expansion Project In May 2018, government announced a $2 billion financial backst op in support of the federal government's purchase of the Tr ans Mountain Expansion Project. No agreements were concluded by fiscal year end. In May 2018, the Government of A lberta launched the Keep Canada Working national advertising and advocacy campaign in support of t he Trans Mountain Expansion Pr oject. In January 2019, the Government of Alberta partici pated in opposition to the Stand.e arth legal motion that sought to delay the National Energy Board's (NEB) rec onsideration of the Trans Moun tain Expansion Project. The NEB ultimately ruled against Stand.earth. Through much of 2018, the Governm ent of Alberta supported the r eference case on heavy oil transport. The final submissions by the Atto rney General of B.C. and Attor ney General of Canada were submitted in February 2019, for the March 2019 hearing. Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 37 Keystone XL and Line 3 The Government of Alberta contin ued to advocate for the develop ment of Keystone XL and Enbridge's Line 3 Replacement Projects tha t continue to face regulatory an d legal challenges in the U.S. The Government of Alberta provided written comments to the U.S. Sta te Department regarding the Draft Environmental Assessment and Draft Supplemental Environmental I mpact Statement in support of the Keystone XL Mainline Alternativ e Route Project, and is preparin g to do so for the forthcoming State Department posting of a revised Supplemental Environmental Impa ct Statement. In November 2017, the Go vernment of Alberta, through the APMC e ntered into agreement with TC Energy Corp to commit 50,000 barr els per day on the Keystone XL pipeline to assist TC Energy Corp in achieving its final investment decision. In 2018, the commitment was transf erred to another shipper whic h eliminated the future financial commitment and exposure to diff erential risk by APMC on that pipeline while resulting in sufficient shi pper support for the project t o be viable at, ultimately, no cost to government. Crude by Rail In February 2019, the Government o f Alberta announced a $3.7 bi llion program to increase rail capacity to help transport Alberta's oil to markets in the medium-term ( three years) until new pi peline capacity is in service. This investment was a nnounced to address pipeline cons traints and includes leasing about 4,400 rail cars to move up to 120,000 bar rels per day 2020, with the expectation of shipment s starting as early as July 2019. The current government is reviewing this commitme nt in order to properly place the contracts in the hands o f the private sector. Federal Bills C-48 and C-69 Federal bills related to res ource development will have signifi cant impacts on Alberta's resource industry. Bill C-48, the proposed oil tank er moratorium off the north coa st of B.C., and Bill C-69 which will overhaul how major infrastructure projects such as pipelines, electricit y transmission, highways, bridges and ports will be reviewed and assessed by t he federal government, are al ready creating investor uncertainty and affecting the province's compet itiveness as a viable place for resource development. The Government of Alberta contin ued to advocate for Alberta's i nterests on federal legislation affecting resource development activities . On June 13, 2018, the Governme nt of Alberta sent a letter to Senator David Tkachuk, chair of the Senat e committee studying the bill, in response to Bill C-48. On March 18, 2019, a follow-up letter was sen t to Senator Tkachuk, which out lined the Government of Alberta's significant concerns and stated t hat Alberta believes the bill arbitrary and discriminatory. Advocacy continued on Bill C-69 as well. On May 31, 2018, the G overnment of Alberta sent another letter and technical submission about Alberta's significant concerns w ith Bill C-69 to the federal government. Then, on October 9, 2018, the Gove rnment of Alberta sent a lett er and technical submission to Prime Minister Trudeau reiterating Al berta's concerns with Bill C-69 and the lack of consult ation on the bill by the federal government, and incl uded several pr oposed amendment s. The province will continue to provide input into federal proce sses to ensure that Alberta's i nterests are defended against the federal government's efforts to change regul atory processes for resourc e and infrastructure development. Results Analysis 38 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Natural Gas Advisory Panel (NGAP) The Natural Gas Advisory Panel (NGAP) was established in May 20 18 to provide advice and recommendations on short-, medium-, and long-term actions the G overnment of Alberta could take to ensure Alberta is receiving maximum value for its natural gas r esources from available or potential markets. The panel provided a report to t he minister in October 2018 whi ch outlined recommended actions that government could consider to grow Alberta's natural gas sector. The report outlined 48 technical and specific recommendations to grow the natural gas sector, includ ing ways to improve pipeline capacity, regulatory standards a nd metrics, timefram es for project approv als, transparency and accountability, and setting a vision for Canada's natural gas industry. Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG) Investment Team As the first action to implemen t NGAP's advice related to marke t access, in December 2018, the Government of Alberta established a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Investment Team to work directly with industry on reducing barriers fo r securing final investment dec isions on export project s that will increase the value of Alberta's natural gas resources. The LNG Investmen t Team engaged key industry members and other stakeholders to identif y next steps on export project s that will source and in crease the value of Alberta's natural gas resources. The LNG Investment Team gather ed input from these stakeholders and submitted their advice to the minister in March 2019. Additional Items of Note Alberta's Royalty System Transparency and Performance In 2018-19, the ministry continue d to track and report on the r oyalty system in Alberta. The reporting helps Albertans examine energy i ndustry trends in the province and the benefits that industry generates for Alberta in comparison with other jurisdictions.

Carbon Capture and Storage The government committed $1.24 billion dollars through to the e nd of 2025 to two carbon capture and storage projects: The Quest and Al berta Carbon Trunk Line proje cts. Combined, thes e two projects will capture approximately 2.76 milli on tonnes of carbon dioxide ann ually. This is roughly equivalent to the annual emissions from 600,000 vehicles. The Quest project achieved commercial operation in mid 2015 and has been successfully capturing over one million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually from the Shell Sc otford Upgrader and permanently storing it underground in a deep saline aquifer. The Alberta Carbon Trunk Line pr oject experienced delays in arr anging the final stages of project financing. All required financing arrangements for the project are now complete, construction is underway and the project is scheduled to achieve commercial operation in late 2019. Once operational, the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line project is antic ipated to capture approximate ly 1.68 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually from the Nutrien Inc. fe rtilizer plant and the Sturgeo n Refinery. Captured carbon dioxide will be transported through a 240 kilome tre pipeline - currently under construction - to be utilized and Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 39 permanently stored as part of enhanced oil recovery operations near Clive, Alberta. The pipeline has been designed to transport up to 14.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. Throughout the year, the department continued to monitor, admin ister and ensure compliance under the Carbon Capture and Storage Fundi ng Agreements for these project s, including: Administration of an injection payment for carbon dioxide seque stration and levy into the Post-closure Stewardship Fund in support of the Quest project. Third party certification of car bon dioxide sequestered. This p rocess provides confidence in the mass of carbon dioxide sequ estered and supports the Post-cl osure Stewardship Fund levy payment. To date, the Post-closure Stewa rdship Fund has collected three annual injection levy payments from the Quest projec t. This levy helps provide for fu ture monitoring, measurement and verification of carbon captur e and storage sites by the Gov ernment of Alberta, after carbon capture and storage operat ions cease and the government assumes liability for any stored carbon dioxide. In 2018-19, the department continu ed to help guide the developm ent of a Monitoring, Measurement and Verification Plan for the Albe rta Carbon Trunk Line by Enhance Energy Inc. The department also initiated a review of the current Post-clos ure Stewardship Fund rate. After a thorough review, the depa rtment agreed to Enhance Energ y's request to assign some of its interest in the Carbon Capture and Storage Funding Agreement fo r the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line to Wolf Carbon Solutions Inc. The company will construct, own and opera te the carbon dioxide capture and pipeline transportation assets. The ministry is taking many o f the program management best prac tices introduced in the Carbon Capture and Storage Funding Program and applying them to other new prog rams or initiatives through its program design, monitoring and implementation continual improvement pro cesses.

Percentage of amounts collected compared to owed. Target: 100 per cent of amounts owed are collected. Revenue from Oil, Oil Sands, Gas and Land Sales and Bonuses Source: Ministry of Energy Discussion of Results One of the Department of Energy's mandates is to collect the Cr own's share of energy resources on behalf of Albertans. This performance measure supports this man date by gauging the ability of the department to collect the amounts owed through the development of Alberta's resources. The department requires all royalt y to be calculated and paid i n cash or delivered in kind by a prescribed due date. Systems and processes are in place to collect royalti es and to identify and follow up expeditiously on overdue accounts. Processes are also in place to collect overdue accounts and related interest and penalties. The results reported in this meas ure are based on financial obl igations in which there are no disputes between the Government of Alberta and entities owing funds to t he Government of Alberta. In the latter case, disputed amounts are excl uded from the results until all outstanding matters are resolved. Upon resolution, historical results are reviewed and, if necessary, retroactively adjusted. During the year, all amounts have been or are in the process of being collected, and no write-offs have been made.

Target: 2.8 per cent of global oil consum ption is supplied by Alberta's oil sands. Alberta's Oil Sands Supply S hare of Global Oil Consumption Sources: Alberta Energy Regulator; In ternational Energy Agency Discussion of Results The measure was created in 2011, and introduced for the first t ime in the 2012-15 Ener gy Business Plan. This is a measure of global ener gy competitiveness; an increasi ng share is an indication of the long-run investment competitiveness relative to other global opportuniti es. There are several levers available to the Government of Alberta, which indi rectly impact the results of t he measure. Key levers are the fiscal and royalty regimes, whi ch directly act to incent industry's resour ce development activities, while ensuring that Albertans receive d irect financial benefits in the form of taxe s and royalties. In addition, there are other government policies that influence industry performance, and th erefore oil sands production levels, including promotion of market access, intergovernmental relatio ns, energy research and development, and environmental regulations. The oil sands industry in Alber ta has been significantly affect ed by the decline in the oil prices that got underway in late 2014. Oil prices s ignificantly declined in lat e 2014, and remained relatively low throughout 2015 and 20 16. In September 2014 , the West Texas Int ermediate (WTI) price was US$93.03 per barrel (bbl) while in December 2014 it was US$59.29/bbl. Th e average annual WTI price declined from US$93.00/bbl in 2014 to U S$48.79 in 2015. In 2016, the ave rage annual WTI price further declined to US$43.32/bbl. The price moderately recovered in 2017 to US$5 0.95, and further increased to US$64.74 in 2018, reaching the highest annual level since 2014. Overall, total crude bitumen pr oduction in Alberta increased by about 7.5 per cent from 2017 to 2018, from about 2.83 million barrels pe r day (bbl/d) to about 3.05 m illion bbl/d. The year-ove r-year increase in bitumen production was driven by the increase in the mined prod uction, which went up by about 15 per cent from 2017 to 2018. Accordi ng to the Alberta Energy Regulat or, an increase in mined bitumen production from 2017 to 2018 was largely due to an increase in production from Suncor Energy's Fort Hills mine, Imperial Oil's Kearl mine and the Canadian Natural Resources Limited's Horizon and the Athabasca Oil Sands Project mines. A number of in-situ projects continued to ramp up production in 2.5%2.7%2.6%2.9%3.1% 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Percentage of global oil consumption (%) Results Analysis 42 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 2018; the overall in-situ produc tion went up by about one per c ent from 2017 to 2018. In 2018, mined and in-situ bitumen production was about 1.47 million bbl/d and 1.5 7 million bbl/d, respectively. From 2017 to 2018, the share of mined producti on within the province's total crude bitumen production profile went up from 45 per cent to 48 per cent, w hile the share of in-situ bit umen went down from 55 per cent to 52 per cent. The 2018 performance measure re sult of 3.1 per cent exceeded th e 2018 target of 2.8 per cent, and was also higher than the 2017 act ual result of 2.9 per cent. The ra te of Alberta's crude bitumen production increase from 2017 to 2018 was significantly larger than the ra te of global year-over-year consumption increase, which went up by 1.3 per cent during this time period . Total global oil consumption increased from 97.9 million bbl/d in 2 017 to 99.2 million bbl/d in 2018. While the growth rate of Alberta's total crude bitumen production from 2017 to 2018 was lower than the growth rate of 11.6 per cent that took place from 2016 to 2017, the growth rat e of global oil consumption al so slowed down during this time period; global oil consumption increased by 1.6 per cent from 2016 to 2 017, a faster rate t han the rate achieved over the 2017-18 period. In addition to the fact that Alber ta's bitumen production growt h significantly exceeded the growth in global oil consumption over the 2017-18 period, another reason for the difference between the target and the result was that the ta rget of 2.8 per cent w as based on the 201 6 result for the measure, which was 2.6 per cent. The 2016 year was challe nging for the oil sands indus try. In addition to the relatively low price environment, the industry was als o affected by the Fort McMurra y wildfires. Since the production disruptions that took place in 2016 were due to Fort McMurray w ildfires, they did not represent a negative overall industry trend. The fac t that the target for 2018 was e stablished on the basis of a year which witnessed uncharacteristic produ ction disruptions has contribut ed to a 0.3 per cent difference between a target and an actual result in 2018. Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 43 Outcome Two Effective stewardship and regulation of Alberta's energy and mi neral resources. The ministry engages with all st akeholders on issues involving responsible resource development of Alberta's energy and mineral reso urces. A strategic and integra ted system approach to responsible resource development strengthens the overall environmental, eco nomic and social outcomes for the benefit of Albertans and demonstrates the province's commitment to addressing climate change. Through its policy work with the Albert a Energy Regulator (AER), the mi nistry collaborates with other ministries to regulate Alberta's en ergy industry to ensur e the efficient, saf e, orderly and environmentally responsible development of energy resources. T hrough the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC), t he ministry further supports the interests of Alber tans by ensuring that the delive ry and regulation of Alberta's utility service is fair and responsible. Key Strategies 2.1 Collaborate with other minis tries to establish a balanced a nd sustainable approach to resource management to manage the combined or cumulative effect s of resource development, including regional p lanning, and promote a positiv e legacy from non-renewable resource development. Integrated Resource Management The Government of Alberta approaches natural resource managemen t from an integrat ed and systems approach. Cumulative impacts of a ctivities are examined in rela tion to economic, environmental and social interests. Through the Go vernment of Alberta's Integrate d Resource Management System (IRMS), ministries work together to res ponsibly manage the province's r esources. The Ministry of Energy recognizes that decisions on energy reso urce development requires careful consideration of economic, environmental and social outcomes, a nd that consultation and engagement are key to mitigating risks. T he ministry enhanced capacity in these areas by establishing an Engaging Communities Practice Group, colla borating with other ministries through IRMS and conducting engagement sessions with Indigenous communities, industry parti cipants and other stakeholders. Indigenous Community Relations The Ministry of Energy is commi tted to strengthening the minist ry's relationships with Indigenous communities to support responsible energy resource access, deve lopment and market access. This past year, the Department o f Energy received treaty teachi ngs in a pipe ceremony led by elders to help ground the department's wo rk. This was done to support the ongoing process of reconciliation, and to develop and maintain relati onships with Indigenous peoples i n Alberta. Liability Management Liability management is about imp roving the management of the f inancial and environmental liabilities associated with upstream oil and ga s development while maintain ing Alberta's status as a competitive place to invest. The Ministry of Energy is committed to ensurin g that the liabilities as sociated with energy development are managed, without discouraging new investment. Results Analysis 44 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Managing liabilities is an inevit able part of responsibly devel oping our natural resourc es. During the worst economic downturn in more than a generation, Alberta's oil and gas industry has demonstrated its resilience and has managed a growing number of orphan sites, in solvencies, and low oil and gas prices. While Alberta waits for pipelines to access world prices for it s products, the pre ssure on Alberta's producers will continue, and Al berta's oil and gas industry - a nd Albertans - are up to the challenge. This past year, the ministry wor ked with the Ministry of Enviro nment and Parks on improvements to the liability management system. With the help of industry, AER dev eloped an area-based closure program that encourages companies and service companies to work t ogether and openly share best pr actices and technology and provide early identification of closure work that will be conducted to facilitate collaboration. This resulted in more timely decommissioning and recla mation of energy sites, lower l iabilities, and greater cost savings. For example, recent pilot projects re sulted in an estimated cost sa vings of 10 to 40 per cent, and the closure work was conducted to a high standard and in less time. In 2016 and 2017, the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench and the Al berta Court of Appeal rendered decisions in the case of Redwater Energy Corp., which was subse quently appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. In January 2019, the S upreme Court of Canada stated that federal bankruptcy laws do not provide a licence to ignore rule s, and that bankrupt estates mu st comply with regulatory orders. While the court provided welcomed clarity , the fact remains that companie s in financial difficulty are less likely to meet their end-of-life obligations. On January 1, 2019, amendments to Section 3.1 of the Responsible Energy Development Act 's General Regulation came into force. It guarantees t he right of local governments (municipal authority, Indian reserve or M\u00e9tis settlement) to participate in AER hearings whe n a statement of concern has been filed. Orphan Well Loan Program The Government of Alberta used a $30 million grant from the Gov ernment of Canada to cover the costs of providing a $235 million loan to the Orphan Well Association (OWA). The loan w ill help the OWA address the growing inventory of o rphaned sites, while creating jobs in the oilfield and environmental service sectors and maintaini ng the polluter pays principle. Repayment of the loan began Janua ry 1, 2019 and is funded throu gh the existing orphan fund levy paid by industry and managed on OWA's behalf by AER. Within fiscal 2 018-19, $100 million was advanced to the OWA. To learn more about OWA's work on managing the province's orphan wells and to read the association's annual report, visit: www.orphanwell.ca. Caribou Range Planning Government supported the development of caribou range plans in response to the Government of Canada's requirements in October 2017 under the Species at Risk Act. The Ministry of Energy supported the Ministry of Environment and Parks in caribou range planning . The restrictions on tenure sales in caribou ranges and availability of extensions for agreements wi thin a caribou range when circumstances prevented the continuation or va lidation of the agreement creat ed time and space for range planning and ensured that Alberta's responsib ilities to manage species at ri sk were carried out in a balanced way. Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 45 Moose Lake Special Management Zone Plan The ministry represented energy interests with the development of the Ministry of E nvironment and Parks Draft Moose Lake Access Special Management Zone Plan. This cros s-ministry collaboration supported the effective stewar dship and regulation of Alberta's energy an d mineral resources under the Lower Athabasca Regional Plan while honouring Treaty Rights. Conservation Area Planning and Implementation The Ministry of Energy, along with other IRMS partners provided input into the Ministry of Environment and Parks to develop three land us e planning proposals in 2018- 19. The ministry continued implementat ion of conservation areas des ignated under the S outh Saskatchewan Regional Plan, and is in the process of cancelling portions of 10 metallic and industrial minerals agreements that fell within the boundaries of the Bow Valley, H igh Rock, and Castle wildland provincial parks and Castle Provincial Park . Managing competing priorities for conservation of lands while ensuring reasonable access for energy and mineral development continued to be a challenge in 2018-19. Strong, open and collaborative cross-mini stry relationships and ongoing engagement with affected operators served as an effective way to understand issues towards the dev elopment of balanced approaches. 2.2 Optimize regulation and over sight to ensure the safe, effi cient, effective, credible and environmentally responsible development of Alberta's energy res ources. Enhancing the oil and gas regulat ory system for efficiency and improved response The Ministry of Energy, in conjun ction with the AER and the Min istry of Environment and Parks, continued to work in partnership with indu stry to improve the regulatory efficiency for the oil and gas industry in the province. Industry has a keen inte rest in improvements to Alber ta's regulatory system. Discussion with industry and analysis served to identify additional ways to imp rove regulatory efficiency. The energy development landscape in Alberta continues to change rapidly, driven by economic circumstances, technology, and ch anging expectations and the AE R continued to adapt to these changes. As the AER works to deliver on its mandate and vision, many initiatives are considered for the benefit they have for all Alberta ns. During 2018- 19, AER contin ued to work to assess these for value and risk exposure, through a deliberat e approach to deliver on all aspects of its mandate and ensure that regulatory oversight is effectiv e in its regulatory delivery wh ile being cost effective. The AER is committed to improve its review of results and performance in an effort t o learn, and to provide more transparency to the public about the regulation of energy development activitie s, hold operators ac countable for their actions and work with industry to improve its performance. In O ctober 2018, the AER published updated application processing timelines a s part of its work to improve efficiency and help make Alberta more competitive. The AER continued to focus on effective management of public sa fety and environmental risks and the management of resource conservation and minimized financial lia bility on Albertans. This included sustainable water use, reduced fluid tailings accumulation over mine life, reduced methane emissions, reduction of aging inventory, and pipeline safety with a focus on reducing high-consequence pipeline incidents. In addition to taking en forcement actions when requi red, the AER achieved this outcome by examining incident data, adopti ng a risk-based ap proach and by enhancing the investigation process. Results Analysis 46 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Water Reporting for Su stainable Water Use In May 2017, the AER began reportin g company-specific informati on on the amount of water used for in- situ, mining, hydraulic fracturing and enhanced oil recovery op erations. This report is updated annually and provides contextual informati on concerning the major driver s of water use during energy extraction within each of the sectors m entioned above. It reports the amou nt of water available and allocated at the provincial and water shed levels within the province as well as each company's water use intensity per barrel of oil equivalent produced. Tailings Management The AER published all decisions to tailing management plans on its website. The first State of Fluid Tailings Management for Minable O il Sands report was published September 2018. The report is updated annually and summarizes informati on submitted by oil sands oper ators in their annual tailings management reports to ensure t hat these submissions adhere to t he requirements of Directive 085; Fluid Tailings Management for Oil Sands Mining Projects and the conditions in each operator's tailings approvals. The report includes a summary of: Fluid tailings volumes at both a regional level and for each in dividual operation; Treated fluid tailings volumes fo r each operator by treatment t echnology; Fluid tailings treatment operations and continuous improvement for each operator; and Technological innovation in flui d tailings treatment for each o perator. Pipeline Safety The AER ensured integrity for pipelin e infrastructure in a way that reduces risk and ensures Albertans reap the economic rewards of ener gy resource. The AER inspects pipeline operations regularly to ensure that companies are meeting the requirements and are monitoring for potential risks. AER's inspections consider the risks of individual pipelines, and pipelines with greater risks receive more scrutiny. The AER has also implemented an assessment program to evaluate the effe ctiveness of pipeline licensees' safety and loss management systems. The program aims to ensure that ad equate systems have been implemented, which will result i n fewer pipeline incidents and greater licensee accountability. The number of high consequence pipeline in cidents was 23 in 2018-19, 24 in 2017-18, and 30 in 2016-17. Integrated Decision Approach (IDA) The Ministry of Energy collaborated with the AER to develop policies to support the full implementation of the Integrated Decision Approach (IDA). Using a new technology known as One Stop, the AER began to implement the IDA for energy dev elopment in 2018-19. IDA is bas ed on the concept of one application, one review, and one decision, and is applicable across the life cycle of energy development. Enhancements were made to pipeline licencing in 2018-19 along w ith the start of the public land authorizations and well licencing projects. This supports effor ts to enhance regulation and oversight of energy resource development and in creases the effectiveness of AER decisions by focusing on what matters the most to Albertans and making the AER administrative processes more effi cient. The approach also offers more transparency , allowing Albertans to see the wh ole picture of a proposed energy project. Regulatory Compliance The AER initially established this indicator based on data comp iled during the transition to a new Compliance Assurance Framework wh ich better reflected its new a uthorities and mandate. This indicator reports the percentage of inspect ions conducted that are in com pliance with regulatory requirements. Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 47 In 2018-19, the AER conducted 10, 520 field-based initial inspec tions, in which 10,401 of those inspections resulted in a finding of compliance. The inspection s resulted in the issuance of 119 enforcement actions, which is comprised of the following: 92 suspensions; four warning letters; seven administrative penalties; one administrative sanction; 13 orders; and two prosecutions. The 2018-19 results are within t he expected range of compliance and demonstrate progress toward the desired outcome of ensuring indu stry compliance with regulatory requirements. Factors like changing market condi tions, changing political cli mates, increased insolvency, incidents, and other PESTLE (political, economi c, social, technological, legal , and environmental) fact ors make it difficult to attain 100 per cent compliance. Inspections are selected based on an enterprise management appr oach to defining and applying risk as well as the predetermined level o f risk that the activity may p ose to public safety, the environment, resource conservation, and stak eholder confidence in the regula tory process, including public and political influences. The AER plac es higher priority on reactiv e work, such as responding to releases and complaints. The amount of reactive inspection work can signific antly impact the reported result for this measure because the nature of t he work is unplanned and has a h igh chance of resulting in compliance action and because, less time w ill be spent condu cting proactiv e compliance activities. AER's requirements and inspection and audit programs ensure tha t the verification of compliance is done in a way that protects the envi ronment and public safety. By sh aring AER investigation reports externally companies have the opportunity to learn the root cause of situa tions and improve their practices. Continuing to meeting with companies that historically have had poor performance and publicly sharing the Pipeline Industry Performan ce Report and Water Use Industry Performance report allows companies to understand how they measure up. Additionally the AER works w ith companies years in advance to help manage energy development to m ake sure they are prepared t o meet their obligations at the end of a project's life. Internally, AER continued to prioritize staff training to align with its high priority inspection and audit areas and continue to enhance its industry education program. Regulatory Compliance Rates Percentage of inspections resulting in a finding of compliance 2016-17: 99 per cent 2017-18: 99 per cent 2018-19: 99 per cent Results Analysis 48 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 AER continued to develop innovativ e approaches, programs, and p rocesses to manage these liabilities and risks while supporting econom ic development in the province . The AER's approach to managing liability was built to balance mult iple interests: environmenta l protection, public safety, landowner interests, investment, royalti es, jobs, and market volatility. Indigenous Engagement at AER The AER has identified as one of i ts strategic goals that the r egulation of Alberta's energy resources is improved by actively engaging Indigenous peoples, stakeholders and the public. To advance the AER toward a future-state where AER 's relationship with Indigenous peoples is one of mutual trust and respect, the AER has begun an as sessment of its engagement with Indigenous communities. This assessment includes how the AER c an best work with other Govern ment of Alberta ministries with a focus on efficiency and improvi ng working relationships with In digenous communities. The cost of AER's activities in 2018-19 was $259 million and wa s fully funded by industry levies. 2.3 Enhance regulation and over sight of Alberta's utilities to ensure social, economic and environmental interests of Alberta are protected. AUC Compliance Audits The current Code of Conduct Regulation came into effect January 1, 2016 and requires audits to be performed for all distributors, regulated rate suppliers and af filiated providers (r elated competitive retailers) at least once ev ery 36 months. Under the Code of Conduct Regulation , the AUC has jurisdiction for code of conduct matters for electricity entities and gas en tities and plays a central role in ensuring compliance with the regulation. Fulfilling the audit requiremen ts as outlined in the regulation further enhances the AUC's oversight of Alberta's utilities. The commission complete d audits of three large entities (i.e., ATCO group, Direc t Energy and EPCOR group consi sting of eight separate audits) by December 31, 2018. The results of these audits confirmed that t hese large entities are meeting the requirements of the Code of Conduct Regulation (i.e., no contraventions). W ith the completion of these audits, the commission intends to l ead audit execution of small er Rural Electrification Associations in fiscal 2019-20. In addition, the AUC relaunched it s compliance assessment progr am targeting minor transmission facilities in 2018, building on the positive outcome from the i nitial compliance review in 2016. The commission's objective was to assess whether transmission facil ity owners are fulfilling the requirements set out by the commission for mino r transmission facilities to mitigate any social, env ironmental and cost issues occurring as a result of t hese projects. No major issues were identified in the commission's compliance assessment targeting minor transmission facilities. Electric Distributi on System Inquiry In late 2018, the AUC la unched the Electric D istribution System Inquiry. The evolving nature of electric generation, consumption, storage an d the system has significant implications for the grid, incumbent utilities, consumers, grid managers and the regulatory framewor k. These are among the central matters the AUC will examine in i ts distribution inquiry. For the AUC, the changing energy system raises fundamental ques tions about traditional planning approaches, rate struct ures, cost-recovery mechanisms, incentiv es and the evaluation of prudent utility costs. Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 49 The commission expects that advan cements in distributed energy resources and smar t technologies will require a proactive approach to regulation. Understanding the c onvergence of information and operational technology in the distribution grid is fundamental in determini ng what types of investments will facilitate the alignment of distributed res ources and changing consumption patterns to ensure the continued provision of reliable serv ice at reasonable rates. The commission also recognizes t hat the prospect of technology adoption raises questions about the current distribution system bus iness model, and whether alterna tive models will be required to enable incumbent utilities to absorb t he potential risk of significant distributed energy resource deployments. Finally, a key issue for the commi ssion, given its mandate, is whether the current approach to rates and rate design needs to be re-evaluated in light of new technology advances and market entry of new and non-traditional participants providing alternative technology. Given these demands, the result s of this inquiry will assist th e commission in charting the regulatory agenda in the foreseeable future to effectively and efficiently achieve its mandate. The inquiry is currently in the preliminary planning phase. The cost of AUC's activities in 2018-19 was $32 million and was fully funded by industry. 2.4 Collaborate with the Alberta Climate Change Office and oth er ministries to develop and implement regulatory standards as part of Alberta's Climate Lea dership Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by: Reducing methane levels for the upstream oil and gas sector by 45 per cent from 2014 levels by 2025; and Limiting emissions from oil sands development. Methane Emissions Reduction Regulation Throughout 2018-19, the Ministry of Energy led a multi-stakehol der approach in the development of regulatory standards on methane emission abatement. Draft AER m ethane directives were released for public comment in April 2018 and 119 respondents provided uniqu e feedback, which were considered in the development of the new requirements. Directive 060: Upstream Petroleum Industry Flaring, Incineratin g, and Venting and Directive 017: Measurement Requirements for Oil and Gas Operations - collectiv ely known as Alberta's methane regulations - were published on the AER website in December 201 8. The directives will come into force starting January 1, 2020 with the mandated check-in point of 20 23 to ensure the 45 per cent reduction target is met. In 2018-19, the Ministry of Ener gy also developed Alberta's Methane Emission Reduction Regulation in collaboration with the Ministry of Alberta Environment and Park s to aid the achievement of federal equivalency on methane emission requirements. The regulation wa s authorized in early December 2018 and will take effect January 1, 2020. The ministry also led the negot iation for an equivalency agreem ent with Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). Despite c hallenges from ECCC accepting eq uivalency continued as differing modelling approaches, methodologies, data and assumptions used by Alberta and along with Ministry of Results Analysis 50 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Environment and Parks, the minist ry collaboratively provided EC CC with necessary information supporting the federal modelling exercise. Oil Sands Emissions Limit The Oil Sands Emissions Limit Act came into force December 2016 and legislates the annual 100- megatonne greenhouse gas limit on oil sands emissions, sets the scope of facilities included, enables allowable exclusions for new upg rading and cogeneration emissio ns, and grants authority to develop regulations. The cap increases the incentive to drive technolog ical progress while ensuring Alberta's operators have the necessary time to develop and implement new technology to reduce the carbon output per barrel helping drive reductions in Alberta's overall emissions trajectory. The Oil Sands Emissions Limit Act serves as an enabling legisl ative framework, however, the Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation paired with innovation fund programs serve as the primary management approach for oil sand s greenhouse gas emissions. The Ministry of Energy supported the Ministry of Environment an d Parks' work on developing policy options for the Oil Sands Emissions Limit Regulation for the implementation of the 100-megatonne oil sands emissions limit. The Minis try of Energy coo rdinated work on preparing a long- term forecast of oil sands production and associated greenhouse gas emissions and co ntinued to update the forecast utilizing the most up-to-date and verifiable information from t he oil sands sector. T he Ministry of Energy's initial emissions forecasting showed that emissions are not exp ected to exceed the 100-megatonne limit before 2030. The ministry recommended that emi ssions from refineries and sta nd-alone gas fractionating plants in Alberta be excluded from the 100-megatonne limit and treat part ial upgrading emissions as new or expanded upgrading capacity emissions. The Oil Sands Emissions Limit Act enables government to create an exclusion for up to 10 megatonnes for new or expanded upgrading capacity emissions. The Ministry of Energy reiterat ed a strong preference for mecha nisms and protocols that provide early, clear and easily discernible s ignals to all stakeholders regard ing emissions thresholds at which actions will be taken and potential compl iance mechanisms will be initi ated. Design and implementation of the 100-megatonne oil sands emission s limit was put on hold in the fourth quarter of 2018, as the Government of Alberta assessed impacts of several initiatives b y the federal government, including the proposed Impact Assessment Act (Bill C-69). Additional Items of Note Regulatory Amendments In 2018-19, the Ministry of Ener gy amended regulat ions and rene wed expiring regulations. It is important that all regulations under the mandate of the Ministry of Energ y are up to date in terms of expiries and administrative changes are comp leted on a timely basis. The fol lowing list of regulations with expiry dates of 2018 and 2019 were either approved for renewal or expiry: Natural Gas Royalty Regulation, 2009 Oil Sands Royalty Regulation, 1997 Crown Minerals Registration Regulation Petroleum Marketing Regulation The Innovative Energy Technologies Regulation Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 51 Performance Measure 2a: Timelin ess of the needs and facility ap plications (Alberta Utilities Commission). Target: 100 per cent of needs and facilit y applications determined with in 180 days of the application being deemed complete. Timeliness of Needs and Facility Applications Source: Alberta Utilities Commission Discussion of Results In accordance with standards e stablished in Alberta law, the AU C, when considering an application for an approval, permit or licence in re spect of a needs identificatio n document, transmission line or part of a transmission line, must make a decision in a timely manner, and if possible, within 180 days after receipt of a complete application. For 2018, the AUC met the target 87.5 per cent of the time as 3 5 of 40 decisions were issued within the 180-day timeline. The decisions t hat missed the 180-day deadlin e addressed novel, complex issues. The applications were contested by i nterveners and processing time was extended to address procedural motions. Further, because of the complexity of the issues raise d, the AUC employed written argument rather than oral argument which further extended processing tim e. Compared to recent years, the sc ope and nature of interventions on transmission need proceedings increased in 2018. In particular , intervener groups are challen ging the Alberta Electri c System Operator's (AESO) generation and load foreca sts and planning assumptions a s well as its transmission alternatives to a much greater degree than in the past. The A UC has seen a r ise in procedural motions which lead to additional processing time. In 2018 , the AUC saw a rise in requ ests by participants (applicants and interveners) to conduct argumen t in writing rather than orally. The use of written argument can considerably extend processing time for a proceeding. For examp le, it added 20 days to the AESO Provost need proceeding, 28 days to the Stirling wind project h earing and 62 days to the AESO PENV need hearing. 100 9396.7 93.1 87.5 80828486889092949698100102 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Percentage of applications determined within 180 days (%) Results Analysis 52 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Outcome Three Albertans benefit from a stable , reliable electricity system th at protects consumers, attracts investment, and has improved environmental performance. An electricity system that has r easonable prices, reduces emiss ions from coal-fired electricity, and creates a positive investment climate is vital to the social an d economic foundation of Alberta. Alberta requires a modern electricity system to support the transition to a cleaner energy future and meet the needs of a growing province. The Ministry of Energy collaborate s with other ministries, agencies, stakeholders, and Indigenous co mmunities to develop and deliver effective electricity system policies and programs. Key Strategies The ministry undertook many ini tiatives in 2018-19 to move towa rds a stable, reliable electricity system that protects consumers, attrac ts investment, and improves envi ronmental performance. Bill 13: An Act to Secure Alberta's Electricity Future was passed in the legisl ature in June 2018. This legislation: Established and enabled the capacity market; Clarified duties, expectations an d responsibilitie s of electric ity agencies and market participants; Enhanced public interest oversight by requiring all electricity rules to undergo review and approval by the Alberta Utilit ies Commission (AUC); and Ensured clear and mandated requir ements for stakeholder involve ment in the design and operation of Alberta's electricity markets. 3.1 Collaborate with other minis tries to implement recommendat ions and manage regulatory requirements from Alberta's Climat e Leadership Plan to transiti on Alberta's electricity system to a lower carbon system, including: Implementing a plan to phase out coal fired electricity generat ion by 2030; and Delivering on Alberta's commitmen t of 30 per cent electricity p roduction from renewables by 2030. Renewable Electricity Program On November 3, 2016, the Governm ent of Alberta announced the Re newable Electricity Program (REP) to increase the use of renewable electricity such as wind, sola r, geothermal, sustainable biomass and hydro. The first three auctions secured a total of 1,360 megawatts of new renewables. The first competition for REP began in March 2017, with investo rs bidding to provide up to 400 megawatts of renewabl e electricity over a 20-year contract term . On December 13, 2017, the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO ) announced it would procure near ly 600 megawatts of wind from four projects to be built and operational by the end of 2019. Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 53 The second and third REP competitions began in March 2018. REP Round Two was designed to include a minimum 25 per cent Indigenous equity ownership component to encourage participation by Indigenous communities, create the greatest d egree of competition, and pro vide the lowest cost for Albertans. REP Round Three maintained many of t he features of REP Round One. T he results of REP Rounds Two and Three were announced on December 17, 2018. The five successful projects are expected to generate a total of 760 megawatts of renewabl e electricity at an average w eighted price of 3.9 cents per kilowatt hour. Renewable Electricity Program Status: 1,360 megawatts secured through three rounds of bidding Round One (December 2017) Capital Power, an Al berta-based company w ill build the 201-mega watt wind project 60 kilometres southwest of Medicine Hat. EDP Renewables Canada Ltd. will build a 248-megawatt wind farm at their Sharp Hills project east of Hanna, roughly 50 kilometres north of Oyen. Enel Green Power North America, Inc. will build two projects - a 115-megawatt R iverview Wind Farm and a 31-megawatt Phase 2 o f Castle Rock Ridge Wind Power Plant just outside of Pincher Creek. Projects are expected to be operational by the end of 2019. Round Two (December 2018) EDF Renewables C anada Inc., which will bu ild the 201.6-megawatt CypressWind Power project in Medicine Hat.

Projects are expected to be operational in 2021. Round Three (December 2018) TransAlta Corporation, which w ill build the 207-megawatt Windri se Wind project in Pincher Creek. Potentia Renewables Inc., which will build two wind 122.4-megawatt, Jenner Wi nd Power Project. 71.4-megawatt, Jenner Wind Power Project 2. Projects are expected to be operational in 2021. Results Analysis 54 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Coal Transition On November 24, 2016, the provin ce reached agreements with the three coal-fired generators that owned units expected to operate beyond 2030. The coal-fired generatio n units covered under the agreements include: Sheerness 1 and 2; G enesee 1, 2, and 3; and Keephills 3. As part of the off-coal agreements, companies agreed to elimina te emissions from their generating units by 2030, and the province agreed to make voluntary transition p ayments of $97 million annually to the three generators until 2030. The agreements ensure the companie s spend a specific amount every year to support communities, employ a minimum number of people in th e province, keep their head offices in Alberta and continue to invest in Alberta's electricity system. The Ministry of Energy supported coal community and worker supp ort initiatives led by the Ministry of Economic Development, T rade and Tourism, and the Ministry of La bour and Immigration, as well as the federal government. In 2017, the C oal Community Transition Fund was released, supporting 12 projects in 17 coal impacted communities with total funding of approxima tely $5 million to explore economic development options. Coal-to-Gas Natural gas is abundant in Alberta , with low-cost production av ailable, making coal-to-gas conversions a viable cleaner alternative to c oal-fired electricity generation . In comparison to new natural gas combined cycle plants, coal-to-ga s conversions have significantly lower capital costs. Coal-to-gas conversions could save capital while providing an immediate reduction in carbon d ioxide emissions, sulfur dioxides, lead and other pollutants from the existing coal fleet. In 2018-19, the Government of Al berta examined the current and emerging policy framework for coal-to- gas conversions both provincia lly and federally, with the goal of providing clarity and removing unnecessary barriers to allow com panies to make informed decisi ons as to whether or not to convert their existing coal units to natural gas. The Ministry of Energy supported the Ministry of Environment an d Parks in its engagement of the federal government on proposed greenhouse gas emission standards for co al and natural gas generation and the draft Clean Fuel Standard. On October 23, 2018 the federal government released its propose d Output-Based Pricing System, which included differentiated fuel-specific standards for the electri city sector. This regulation will apply to provinces that do not have an equi valent or more stringent syst em. On December 20, 2018 the federal g overnment released draft regu lations, including an update to the standard that will apply to coal and coal-to-gas converted unit s. Dispatchable Renewables and Energy Storage Dispatchable renewables and ene rgy storage have the potential t o play a role in Alberta's electricity system, especially with increas ed penetration of intermittent r enewable generation such as solar and wind. Government reviewed the po licy and legislative framework that impacts the ability of these technologies to enter the electr icity system, including uninten ded or unnecessary policy or legislative barriers. AESO presented a report to gover nment on May 31, 2018, assessin g if dispatchable renewables and energy storage are needed to cont inue to deliver a reliable ele ctricity system out to 2030, and if needed, Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 55 how they should be proc ured. The Department of Energy accepted its recommendation that a specific procurement for dispat chable renewables and energy storage is n ot needed at this time. AESO posted the report on their website on September 25, 2018 and presented the results to stakeholders on October 3, 2018. The report can be found at https://www.a eso.ca/assets/ Uploads/AESO-Dispatchable- Renewables-Storage -Report-May2018.pdf. A complex mix of factors such as relatively low w holesale elect ricity prices, relatively cheap and abundant natural gas supply, and regulatory and polic y uncertainty at th e federal level with respect to issues such as the federal Clean Fuel Standar ds and Bill C-69 has resulted in a complex environment in which corporate decisions relating to e lectricity and energy sector i nvestment decisions can be difficult to predict. Community Generation A cross-ministry initiative be tween the Ministry of Energy, Min istry of Environment and Parks, and the Ministry of Economic Developmen t, Trade and Tourism was necessa ry to ensure the strategic integration and alignment of initiatives, programs and policies across the Government of Alberta to advance community generation. Community generation refers to a subset of small-scale generati on that provides benefits to communities, such as training, environmental protection or economic developm ent opportunities, and distinguishes it from other types of small-scale generation. Small-scale generat ion refers to electricity generated from renewable or alternative source s connected to the distribution system. As part of An Act to Secure Alberta's Electricity Future , the Electric Utilities Act was amended to allow the Minister of Energy to create sma ll-scale generation regulations in Alberta. A new regulation, the Small Scale Generation Regulation , enabling small scale and community generation, came into forc e on January 1, 2019. This regulat ion enables a range of generation projects by reducing re gulatory, technical, and financial barriers for small- scale and community generation within Alberta's existing framework for electricity generation. Geothermal Energy Geothermal energy is the natural heat that originates from the Earth that can be extracted from the subsurface using different techno logies. Geothermal energy has potential applications for direct uses (such as district or community heating) and indirect uses (such as electricity generation), or in support of other economic sector s such as agricultur e, forestry, and oil a nd gas. As an emerging sector, developing Alberta's geothermal energy p otential can present opportunities to support economic and industrial diversification, transition to renewable energy mix , clean energy growth and innovation, and overall compet itiveness of Alberta's econom y. Interest in geo thermal energy development has increased in Al berta; this is attributable to i mproved data and info rmation, technology advancements, oil and gas expertise, established supporting sec tors, and opportunities for repurposing inactive oil and gas wells and co-production. Through the summer 2018, the Mi nistry of Energy, in collaborati on with Indigenous Relations and Environment and Parks, undertook targeted engagement with exter nal stakeholders representing geothermal industry participants , oil and gas operators, enviro nmental non-government organizations, municipal governments, private landowners and freehold mineral owners, researchers, and Indigenous communities. Stakeholder engagement was key to better understan d geothermal resources in Alberta, Results Analysis 56 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 which helped identify key perspecti ves, issues, concerns and op portunities and inform the development of a provincial geotherma l policy framework. In the meantime, the Ministry o f Energy continued to work in co llaboration with cross-ministry and provincial agency partners to develop an interim regulatory app roach where geothermal pilot and demonstration projects are in advanced stages. The ministry act ively worked with proponents on a case- by-case basis to advance potent ial projects and identify risk-b ased regulatory pathways for individual projects to enter the regulatory approval process while work co ntinued to develop a provincial policy framework. 3.2 Develop and implement polic y to efficiently regulate Albert a's electricity retail system to protect consumers. Regulated Rate Option Rate Cap On November 22, 2016, the Govern ment of Alberta announced the i ntroduction of a four-year Regulated Rate Option (RRO) rate cap effe ctive June 1, 2017. The cap was made available to all consumers on the RRO, including residential, fa rm, irrigation, and small commerc ial consumers using less than 250,000 kilowatt hour of electricity per year. Consumers on the RRO payed the lower of the RRO or the governme nt's rate cap of 6.8 cents per kilowatt hour. If the rate excee ded 6.8 cents pe r kilowatt hour , the government paid RRO providers the difference above that price. D uring the 2018-19 fiscal year, th e rate cap was triggered nine times. In December 2018, amendments to the Rate Cap (Board or Council Approved Regulated Rate Tariffs) Regulation and the Rate Cap (City of Medicine Hat) Regulation were made in order to clarify reimbursement and billing rates and allow the City of Medicine Hat a longer reimbursement submission period. 2018-19 Regulated Rate Cap Consumer Reimbursements Months when market rates excee ded the rate cap of 6.8 cents pe r kilowatt hour: April 2018: $8.7 million 2019: $7.5 million February 2019: $2.5 million Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 57 Securing Alberta's Electricity Future: Penalties for Violating Commission Orders On June 11, 2018, Bill 13: An Act to Secure Alberta's Electricity Future came into effect, which allowed the AUC to apply financial penalti es to entities violating a co mmission order, rule or decision. As a result, the commission initiated the dev elopment and implementation of a specified penalties framework as contemplated in Bill 13. The ab ility to impose specified penalt ies for breach of consumer-related AUC rules ensures ut ility service providers , including competitive retailers, fulfill the standa rds of service and safety. Following a rule review and rule development process, the AUC a pproved Rule 032: Specified Penalties for Contravention of AUC Rules and amendments to Rule 021: Sett lement System Code Rules, Rule 028: Natural Gas Settlement System Co de Rules and Rul e 003: Service Standards for Energy Service Providers, with an effectiv e date of January 1, 2019. Through Rule 32, the A UC established a clear framework to apply financial penalties to predefined rule contraventions. The rule outlines specific factors the AUC will consider when determining specified penalties as well as the various levels of those penalties depe nding on the frequency of rule breaches. In addition, amendments to Rule 003 further strengthens consumer p rotection by prohibiting regulated companies from recovering serv ice guarantee credits through the rates charged to other customers. Striking a balance between pract icality and fairness to industr y and consumers pos ed a significant challenge. The AUC responded to th is challenge by taking a cons ultative approach during its rule review and rule development process. Pri or to approving Rule 032 and a mending Rule 003, Rule 021 and Rule 028, the AUC engaged with key stake holders to identify and took into consideration all relevant concerns. Stakeholder engagement and consulta tion continued to be a key s uccess criteria for the commission in its efforts to efficiently regulate Alberta's electricity and natur al gas retail systems to protect consumers. 3.3 Create a reliable electricity system that is affordable fo r Albertans and attractive to investors by implementing an electricity capacity market Capacity Market Framework On November 23, 2016, the governm ent announced that Alberta wou ld transition to a capacity market, based on recommendations from cur rent and potential energy inve stors, external experts, consumer groups and AESO. The new governm ent is now reviewing this polic y. The capacity market design proce ss was completed in 2018-19. Th e Department of Energy led the policy development of the capacity market, and implemented the policy design through amendments to Alberta's electricity acts and regulations and through the creation of a new regulation specifically for the capacity market. AESO also completed the technical design of Alberta's c apacity market during this time frame. The Department of Energy and AESO worked closel y together throu ghout the design process to ensure that the policy and technical mark et designs are well aligned. Approximately 385 stak eholders representing 182 organizations p articipated in the Ministry of Energy's policy development process for t he capacity market. Stakeholder s included generati on, transmission, distribution and retail companies ; Rural Electrification Associ ations; industry associations; potential investors; electricity-related non-governmental organizations; electricity and electricity consumer representatives. The stakeholder session provided inpu t on the development of a number of electricity initiatives, including the An Act to Secure Alberta's Electricity Future , to amend multiple electricity regulations and the creation of a new Capacity Market Regulation . Results Analysis 58 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 All regulatory work was complet ed by December 2018, providing t he legal foundation needed for completion of the technical des ign led by AESO. Both the depart ment and AESO met the publicly stated timelines to complete the policy and technical design work by e nd of January 2019 to target implementation of the capacity market in 2021. The Ministry of Energy continued to monitor the implementation of the technical market design. AESO filed the f irst set of capacity ma rket rules in January 2019 for review and approval by the AUC. The design of a capacity market w as an intense and technical en deavour. Close collaboration between the Department of Energy and Albe rta's electricity agencies and sector stakeholders was essential to this work. Coordination of engagements led by the department and AES O was important to ensure stakeholders were able to parti cipate in both processes. Regulatory Oversight of the Capacity Market On June 11, 2018, Bill 13: An Act to Secure Alberta's Electricity Future came into effect, enhancing the AUC's role in the development and regulatory oversight of Alber ta's electricity system. Legislation now requires the AUC to review and a pprove all new or modified rule s governing Alberta's electricity system. Previously, rules were only subj ect to review and approval if m arket participants filed specific objections to the rules. This change aligns A lberta's rule oversight process with best practices in other jurisdictions and is intended to increase the clar ity, functionality, and stabili ty of electricity system rules. Prompted by the new legislation , the AUC reviewed, consulted on and updated its AUC Rule 017: Procedures and Proce ss for Development of IS O Rules and Filing of ISO Rules with AUC. The intended result of this initiative was to broaden and substantiate the c onsultative process the AESO must apply to ensure fairness, balance and efficacy in the development of mar ket rules. On July 24, 2018, AUC approved amendments to AUC Rule 017. As of August 1, 2018, all amendments to the Electric Utilities Act came into force. In 2018-19, the AUC began to pr epare to review, analyze and app rove the rules submitted by AESO to shape and govern the implementat ion of a capacity market system . The AUC established a dedicated Capacity Markets Group to suppor t the commission to adjudicate on matters that woul d facilitate this transition. Stakeholder input pla yed a key part in the regulato ry work that supported the capacity market development. Stakeholders had the opportunity to provide commen ts during the AUC review, with the AUC legislatively required to r ender decisions on the rules by July 31, 2019. Additional Items to Note Exploring Electricity Interties Transmission interties with t he province's neighbours enable th e import and export of electricity into and out of Alberta. Interties help to maintain supply stability and resiliency in the electr icity system and offer economic benefits to Alberta's e lectricity generators through e lectricity export. The Go vernment of Alberta supported transmission interties with other jurisdictions that benefit the province. Regional Electricity Cooperation an d Strategic Infrastructure ( RESCI) initiative is a Government of Canada initiative involving the governments and electric system operators from Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the Northwest Territories. Through this initiative, a Natural Resources Canada commissioned study was released in August 2018 evaluatin g electricity infrastr ucture projects in the western provinces. Intertie projects assess ed as part of th e study included a new Alberta-British Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 59 Columbia intertie, the Alberta-British Columbia intertie restor ation, a new or Alberta- Saskatchewan intertie, and a new Alberta-Northwest Territories intertie. The restoration of the existing Alberta-British Columbia intert ie to its full capability has an anticipated completion date of 2020-21. AESO and BC Hydro are working on th is project. AESO anticipates filing a Needs Identification Document application with AUC in 2019. Results Analysis 60 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Performance Measure 3a: Transmission losses Target: To maintain a minimum level in transmission line losses. The ta rget for 2018 was 3.7% \u00b1 0.3%. Transmission Losses Source: Alberta Electric System Operator Discussion of Results Electricity is a facilitator o f economic development in Alberta . A reliable and resilient electricity transmission system is required to ensure electricity can be de livered where and when it is needed. By ensuring development of a robust tr ansmission system, renewable and thermal generators will know that they will be able to efficiently move their product to market, and to consumers that depend on it daily. The transmission system h as been, and continues to be, built to acc ommodate greater amounts of renewable energy. Existing and near-term infr astructure projects are expe cted to support greater amounts of renewable generation in the sout h and central-east regions. Gen erally, there is renewable energy potential throughout t he province. Optimal use of power from th ese sources depend s on our ability to bring it to where it is needed. Transmission losses are an indi cator of efficiency of the trans mission system. A trans mission system with adequate capacity will have lower losses than a system that req uires upgrading. The hourly volumes of line losses vary based on load an d export levels , the distance between generation and load, and changes in the transmission topology. Tr ansmission and generation outag e schedules, unplanned transmission and generation out ages, and market dispatc hes also affect the v olume of losses. The value of line losses is calculated on the hourly pool price. 33333.74 3.7 3.43.5 2.9 00.511.522.533.544.5 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Line loss (%) Target Actual Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 61 Transmission line losses are an indicator of system efficiency and optimization. The benefits of maintaining low transmission line losses for Albertans are lowe r system costs, reduced wasted energy, and the environmental benefits as sociated with the need for les s electricity generation. Prior to 2018, the line loss tar get was a qualitative target th at was drawn from the transmission policy development process in 2003. At t he time, the average system lo sses were about five per cent, and as a result, a target of three per c ent was deemed reasonable. However, starting in 2018, the methodology for calculating line loss targets was changed to reflect the five-year rolling average of pri or line losses. As well, the fi ve-year averages used data from the annual totals of the monthly loss factor customer volumes and monthly loss volumes. These line losses are calculated in AESO's Rider E Ca libration Factor report for each quarter, which results in slightly higher actual line losses because bot h volumes use data up to the mete r. In previous year s, the generation volume included generation behind the meter, resulting in a low er calculated line loss value. The 2014 to 2017 actuals shown here have been updated and are based on the new methodology. Results Analysis 62 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Performance Measure 3b: Percentage of electricity produced in A lberta from renewable sources (megawatts) Target: 30% of electricity generation fr om renewable sources by 2030 Renewable Electricity Generation Source: Alberta Utilities Commission Note: Totals may not add up due to rounding Discussion of Results The Renewable Electricity Act established the target that b y 2030 at least 30 per cent of th e electric energy produced in Alberta, measured on an annual basis, will b e produced from renewable energy resources. Under the Renewable Energy Act , renewable energy resource mean s an energy resource that occur s naturally and that can be repleni shed or renewed within a human lifespan, including, but not limited to moving water, wind, heat from the earth, sunlight, and sustaina ble biomass. On November 3, 2016, the Governm ent of Alberta announced the Re newable Electricity Program (REP) to enable Alberta to meet its legislated target of 30 per cent of its electricity being generated from renewable sources by 2030. Three REP procurements were co nducted for a total of approximat ely 1,360 megawatts of new renewable electricity capacity. According to Alberta Electric System Oper ator forecasts, it is expected the percentage of renewable electricity generat ed will significantly increase in 2019-20, as REP projects procured under the first three rounds of the prog ram are scheduled to come on line. 4.324.675.24 5.2 4.952.322.142.11 2.282.262.572.632.62 2.432.4 024681012 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Percentage electricity generated from renewable sources (%) Wind Hydro Biomass Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 63 The percentage change between 2017 and 2018 indicates a decreas e in the renewable electricity share of total generation. In 2018, there was a decrease in both rene wables (approximately 240 gigawatt hours decrease from 2017) and non-renew able generation (approximately 92.5 gigawatt hour s decrease from 2017). The decrease in renewable elec tricity generation from 9.91 per cent down to 9.64 per cent was a result of variability in wind resources (2 018 slightly less windy than th e year prior), and incr eased generation by natural gas in response to retired coal units.

Results Analysis 66 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Performance Measure and Indicator Methodology Performance Measure 1.a: Reve nues from oil, oil sands, gas and land sales bonuses are fully collected Oil Oil royalty volumes owed to the Cr own are calculated in the Roy alty and Marketing (RAM) system. The volumes owed to the Crown are ta ken in kind, rather than invoic ed. The volumes owed are imported from RAM into the Crude Oil Operations system. Reconciliations betwe en the volumes calculated by RAM and the volumes actually delivered by industry are performed by the department, who also follows up and resolves any discrepancies. The department collects the revenue for the Crown's volumes marketed either directly, or by the Crow n's agents, then calculates the net value of all royalty sales, and remits the proceeds to Treasury Board and Finance. Oil Sands Oil Sands Administrative and Stra tegic Information System (OASI S) calculates the monthly amounts to be collected based on the Good Faith Estimates, the Monthly Royalt y Calculations and the Non-Project Royalty reports and annual adjustm ents based on the End of Peri od Statements. All royalty reporting must be submitted electronica lly to the Department of Energy, u sing the web-based Electronic Transfer System (ETS). OASIS then sends t he charge information to the Co rporate Accounting and Reporting System (CARS2). During these proc esses, there are limited manua l interfaces. An information report is available from OASIS to identify the reconciliation of OASIS to CARS2 charge transfers. Land Sale Bonuses The majority of oil sands and petroleum and natural gas agreeme nts are acquired through a public tender process. Each year the departm ent holds an average of 24 public sales, referred to as \"Public Offerings\". The word \"sale\" is used by tr adition, although it is a misnomer , since the Crown always retains title to its minerals. The rights are leased , not sold. The process is an au ction, in which companies or individuals submit bids on a parcel of oil sands or petroleum and natural g as rights. The highest bidder for each parcel is generally awarded an agreement. Indivi duals or compan ies submit a posting request electronically to the department thro ugh web-based ETS. The Pub lic Offering, available on the department's website, is publis hed eight weeks in advance of th e sale date. Bidders can electronically submit bids for sale parcels through ETS until noon on the sale day. After this deadline, a user cannot submit or withdraw a bid. The to tal bid for each parcel must in clude a $625 agreement issuance fee, the first year's annual rental of $3.50 per hectare, and the bonus amount, as determined by the bidder. For oil sands rights, the standard minimu m bonus bid is $2.50 per hecta re for leases and $1.25 per hectare for permits. For petroleum and natur al gas rights, the standard min imum bonus bid is $2. 50 per hectare for leases and $1.25 per hectare for licences. The Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) is the form of payment accepted for winning bids. The re sults of the sale are publishe d on the department's website by 3:30 p.m. on the sale day. The sale resul ts include the parcel number, th e name of the successful bidder and the bonus amount paid for each parce l. After the sale, winning bids are uploaded from ETS to the Land Automated Mineral Agreement Sys tem (LAMAS). The following day, winning bids are uploaded from LAMAS to the Alberta Mineral Info rmation (AMI) sy stem. Payments are typically pulled electronically through LAMAS via EFT (Royal Bank on behalf of the department) on the day of the sale or the following day. Payments are then transferre d to CARS2 as Revenues and Rec eivable. Payment is reflected in CARS2 as Cash in Transit and Re ceivables, which are then entere d into the Integrated Management Alberta Government Informat ion System (IMAGIS). Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 67 Gas The Mineral Revenues Information System (MRIS) receives the dat a to perform monthly royalty calculations and generates a Gas Royalty Invoice on a monthly b asis. MRIS passes a file to CARS2 and a Statement of Account is generat ed on or before the fifteenth of each month in MRIS and then issued to industry. Payments are due on t he last day of the month. Aged A nalysis reports are generated monthly on the CARS2 system. Collection ac tion occurs on accounts that are past due. Performance Measure 1.b: Alberta's oil sands supply share of gl obal oil consumption This measure is calculated as the annual ratio of the total num ber of barrels of Alberta oil sands production over the total num ber of barrels of w orld oil consum ption: Annual barrels of Alberta oil sands production Barrels of world o il consumption The total for annual barrels of A lberta oil sands production is the sum of total mined and in-situ bitumen production in any given calenda r year. Bitumen production data is calculated from Alberta Energy Regulator's (AER) reports. Global oil consumption data is based on the Oil Marke t Report, published by the International Energy Agency. Since the completion of the 2018- 21 Control Record, there have been no changes in the methodology, with the exception of an additi on of a new mined operator, Fort Hills, which commenced production in 2017, and significantly ramped up production in 2018. Therefore , 2017 and 2018 mined bitumen production results i nclude production vol umes from Fort Hills. Performance Indicator 1.a: Price Price, West Texas Intermediate (US$/barrel) This indicator was included in the 2018-21 Business Plan for th e first time. The price that was chosen for the indicator is West Texas Intermediate (WTI). WTI is the Nort h American price benchmark for light sweet oil. Prices are directly ta ken from U.S. Energy Informati on Administration's website, and re- arranged into fiscal year results. Alberta Gas Reference Price (Cdn$/gigajoule) This indicator was included in the 2018-21 Business Plan for th e first time. The price that was chosen for the indicator is Alberta Natural Gas Reference Price (ARP). ARP is one of the components used in natural gas royalty formulas to determine the Crown's revenue s hare of production. It is a monthly weighted average field price of all Alberta gas sales published by the Ministry of E nergy. ARP data is taken directly from the Ministry of Energy's website, and rearr anged into fiscal year results. Performance Indicator 1.b: Production. Alberta's crude oil and e quivalent annual production Volume (thousands of barrels/day) As a percentage of Canadian production This indicator was included in the 2018-21 Business Plan for th e first time. The indicator reports the volume of Alberta's annual crude oil and equivalent production, as well as Alberta's share of total Canadian production. It demonstrat es the vital role that Albert a has in the Canadian oil market context. The indicator focuses only on the production of crude oil and e quivalent. Alberta's crude oil and equivalent production consists of conventional crude production , marketable oil sands production (which consists of non-upgraded bitumen and upgraded bitumen), and con densate and pentanes plus. Results Analysis 68 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 All data for the indicator is t aken from the National Energy Bo ard (NEB). Generally, t he Ministry of Energy relies on AER to report Alberta oil statistics. However, as the requirement of the indi cator is to compare Alberta with the rest of Canada, N EB is used as a source to avo id mixing the sources. Alberta's total marketable natural gas annual production Volume (billion cubic feet/day) As a percentage of Canadian production Previously, this indicator includ ed Alberta production volumes only, without putting Alberta in the Canadian context. Starting with the 2018-21 Business Plan, this indicator has been reporting the volume of Alberta's annual gas production , as well as Alberta's share of total Canadian production. It demonstrates the vital role that Alberta has in the Canadian ga s market context. For this indicator, the Ministry of Energy reports total marketable natural gas product ion volumes. All data for the present indica tor is taken from NEB. Generally , the ministry relies on AER to report Alberta gas statistics; in the 2017-20 Bus iness Plan, AER was used as a source of Alberta gas production statistics. However, a s the requirement of the present indicato r is to compare Alber ta with the rest of Canada, NEB is now used as a sour ce to avoid mixing the sources . Performance Indicator 1.c: Investment Upstream: Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas industry investmen t in Alberta Cdn$ (billions) Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Ga s Extraction Sector investmen t in Alberta as a Percentage of Canadian investment This indicator reports investm ent in Alberta's Mining, Quarryin g, and Oil and Gas Extr action sector. It also puts Alberta in the nat ional context, by repor ting Alberta's mi ning, quarrying, and oil and gas investment as a percentage of total Canadi an investment in the sector. Previously, in the 2017-20 Business Plan, the indicator focused only on oil and gas extraction, which consists of both conventional o il and gas, and oil sands extrac tion. The revised indicator, which was included for the first time in 2018-21 Business Plan, has been expanded to include the entire upstream energy extraction sector; in addi tion to oil and gas extraction , the expanded indicator now also covers mining and quarrying, and suppor t activities for mining, and oi l and gas extraction. The updated indicator was reported by Ministry of Ener gy in the 2018-21 Business Plan . The data for the Indicator is ta ken from Statistics Canada. Dat a is reported on a cale ndar year basis. In addition to actual results, the pr esent indicator also reports the most current preliminary actual result, to enhance the timeliness of data pr esentation. The preliminary ac tual results will in all likeliness be revised once the actual results become available. Downstream: Petroleum, Coal and Chemical Manufacturing Cdn$ (billions) Alberta as a percentage of Canadian investment In addition to upstream investm ent, the energy indu stry generat es significant downstream activity; this indicator focuses on the invest ment impacts of the downstream a ctivity. The indicator is explicitly focused on petroleum and coal product manufacturing, and chemical manuf acturing; this allows for the coverage of petroleum refining and petr ochemical manufacturing activity, among other downstream activities. The downstream investment porti on of the indicator was included in the 2018-21 Business Plan for the first time. This indicator can be treated as complementary to t he \"Upstream: Mining, Quarrying, and Oil Results Analysis Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 69 and Gas industry investment in Al berta\" indicator, since that i ndicator covers upstream energy industry investment activity in Alberta . There is no overlap between the data reported by both indicators, as these indicators are based on different industrial categories. Just like investment data in the \"Upstream: Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas industry investment in Alberta\", data for this indicato r is taken from Statistics Cana da. Data is reported on a calendar year basis. In addition to actual results, the indicator also reports the m ost current preliminary actual result, to enhance the timeliness of data pr esentation. The preliminary ac tual results will in all likeliness be revised once the actual results become available. Performance Indicator 1.d: Employment Direct employment in the Mini ng, Quarrying and Oil and Gas Extr action sector (thousands) This indicator was included in the 2018-21 Business Plan for th e first time. The indicator reports the total number of people directly emplo yed in Alberta as a result of th e upstream mining, Quarrying and Oil and Gas Extraction sector activity . Data for this indicator is take n from Statistics Cana da, and is reported on a calendar year basis. Performance Indicator 1.e: Market Access Total percentage of crud e oil leaving Alberta For this indicator, the Minist ry of Energy reports the share of total volume that leaves Alberta as a percentage of total Alberta oil di sposition. All data is calcul ated from the AER's reports. Total percentage of natu ral gas leaving Alberta For this indicator, the Minist ry of Energy reports the share of total volume that leaves Alberta as a percentage of total Alberta gas d isposition. All data is calcul ated from the AER's reports. Note: both components of the indi cator were reported in the 20 17-20 Business Plan; however, they were reported without the \"Market A ccess\" heading. In the 2018-21 Bu siness Plan, performance indicator 1.e was identified as the \"Market Access\" indicator. Performance Measure 2.a: Timelin ess of the needs and facility a pplications The statutory deadline for issui ng decision reports is 180 days , with possible 90-day extensions under certain circumstances. These sta tutory timelines begin on the d ate when the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC) deems the application comp lete. The status of application s is tracked daily. Performance Indicator 2.a: Regulatory compliance AER staff inspects operations of t he upstream oil and gas and c oal mining industries with respect to the drilling, production, and disposal of hydrocarbons and associat ed wastes. All inspection results are recorded into the Field Inspecti on System and result in an outc ome of either compliant or noncompliant. If the inspection is noncompliant t he triage tool is used to asses s the significance of the noncompliance and determine the need for an investi gation. If an investigation is warranted, information and evidence is collected relevant to the noncomp liance. The investigation will determine if an enforcement action is required. Field inspections for this measure includes the follo wing activities: drilling operations, gas facilities, oil facilities, pipel ines, well servicing operation s, drilling waste, well si tes, coal mines, mineable oil sands and waste management fa cilities, and is counted based on the year the inspection was initiated. Inspections are counted based on the date of the initial inspec tion. Results Analysis 70 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Performance Indicator 2.b: Pipeline incidents The AER is focused on ensuring t he safe transportation of hazar dous products by regulating development in a way that reduces risk and en sures Albertans reap the econo mic rewards of the energy resources. A reportable pipeline incident under the AER's jurisdiction is an y pipeline release, b reak or contact damage (regardless if there is a rel ease) (Section 35 of the Pipeline Act ). Incident information is entered into the AER's Field Inspection System database by AER inspectors. The i ncident information is used to assign a consequence rating by the AER to indicate the potential severit y of an incident. The rating is based on information of the incident r egarding a set of indicators that reflect the impacts on the environment, wildlife, and public. High conse quence pipeline incidents are t hose that could have significant impacts to the public, wildlife, or the env ironment, or that involve the r elease of a substance that affects a large area or water body. The Pipeline Tec hnical Specialist and Industry O perations pipeline subject matter experts regularly complete data integrit y reviews on pipeline incident records, which include the consequence rating assigned, and the inspection data. Records are reviewed for accuracy and consistency with established data integrity procedures. Performance Measure 3.a: Transmission losses Every year, the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) publish es two data points required for transmission line loss calculati ons: Alberta's annual internal load (in gigawatt hours) and line losses (in gigawatt hours). The calculation for this performance measure i s: Transmission Losses (%) = Annual total of monthly line loss vol umes Annual total of monthly line lo ss factor custo mer volumes Source Documentation: AESO publis hes Alberta's annual internal load each year in its Annual Market Statistics report at h ttps://www.aeso.ca/mar ket/market-and-syst em-reporting/annual-market-statistic- reports/. AESO publishes line loss es each year in its annual re port. AESO calculates line losses as follows: Line losses = (Total Generation + Imports) - (Total Consumption + Exports) Performance Measure 3.b: Renewable generation In Alberta, renewable generation refers to naturally occurring energy resources that can be replenished or renewed within a human lifespan, including, but not limited to moving water, wind, heat from the earth, sunlight, and sustainable biomass. Electricity generation data from both renewable and non-renewab le sources is collected and reported annually by the AUC. The source of information is regulatory fi lings under the Hydro and Electric Energy Act by operators of power generating facilities. The result of the measure, for any given year, is calculated as follows: Electricity generated in Alberta from all renewable sources (me gawatt hours) Total electricity generated in Alberta (megawatt hours) The data is collected and r eported annually by the AUC. x 100% x 100% Financial Information Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 71 Financial Information Table of Contents Financial Information ......................................... ............................................................... ............... 71 Ministry Financial Highlights ................................. ............................................................... ........ 72 Statement of Revenues and Expenses ............................................................... .................. 72 Revenue and Expens e Highlights ................................ ......................................................... 73 Breakdown of Revenues ........................................ .............................................................. 7 4 Expenses - Directly Incurr ed Detailed by Object ............... .................................................. 77 Supplemental ................................................... 79 Lapse/Encumbrance ............................................. ...............................................................

This is offs et by higher than anticipated in come from the Balancing Pool ($200 million) primarily as a result of increased revenues from elect ricity sales due to higher realized electricity prices. Expenses Energy's 2018-19 fiscal year operating expenditures totalled $7 45 million, with an operating surplus of $120 million and increased spending of $208 million compared to the 2017-18 fiscal year. This was primarily related to: o Climate Leadership Plan - The Regulated Rate Option (RRO ) Rate Cap program was initiat ed to help provide financial relief to RRO customers in Alberta by pr oviding a price cap on electricity prices, minimizing the impact o f price volatility in the electr icity market. There was increased spending of $53 million in 2018-19 compared to 2017-18. However , this was $22 million lower than originally budgeted as the third party forecast of electricity market prices was even higher. o Carbon Capture and Storage - This program supports Carbon C apture and Storage projects in Alberta. The Alberta Carbon Trunk Line Project (ACTL), which wi ll transport captured CO 2 from the Industrial Heartland north of Edm onton to Central Alberta for e nhanced oil recovery, reached a number of construction mileston es during the year. These milest one achievements resulted in increased grant funding provided in 2018-19 compared to 2017-18 ($115 million). The project did miss on reaching commercialization during the year, which resul ted in a budget variance of $108 million, which was anticip ated as part of the budget. o Market Access - Development costs of $6 million re lated to the setup of the Cru de by Rail initiative, announced in November 2018, to address market acces s constraints that have landlocked Alberta resources from global export and lowered the relative value of Alberta resources from an international perspective. In February 2019, the APMC was directed, as an agent of the Crown, to proceed wit h the execution of the Crude by Rail program.

In 2 018-19, bitumen revenue totaled $3.2 billion. Act ual bitumen royalties were abo ut 80 per cent, or $1,429 million higher than budgeted. This variance is mainly due to higher than forec ast WTI and Western Canadian Select (WCS) prices on average for the fiscal year. Conventional crude oil royalties contributed $1,149 million. Conventional crude oil r oyalties were $96 million, or nine per cent hig her than the budgeted amount due t o higher than forecast prices for WTI and higher oil production. Natural gas and by-products royalties brought in $536 milli on and were $5 million below th e budgeted amount. Prices for natural gas by-products such as propane, but ane and pentanes plus follow oil prices. The improved oil prices spurred in creased production as compani es are trying to maximize natural gas liquids extraction, especially pentanes plus used as diluent fo r oil sands production. This offset much of the lower than expected na tural gas prices impact. In 2018-19, bonuses and sales of Crown leases totaled $360 million, which was $33 million or 10 per cent higher than the budgeted amou nt. The majority of the sales (98 per cent) were from petroleum and natural gas leases (PNG). The number of PNG hectares sold was h igher than forecast, more than offsetting a lower than expect ed average price per hectare. Revenue from rentals and fees was $160 million in 2018-19, exceeding the budgeted revenue by $48 million, or 43 per cent. Rentals and fees revenue are tied to s ales in the current and the previous four years. The higher than budgeted revenue was mainly due to highe r number of hectares and retention rates for leases and licences by industry. This affects rental and fees because in addition to the bonus amounts paid for the hectares so ld, an agreement issuance fee a nd rental for the first year of the agreement is required. Included in other taxes, revenue and royalties totalling $112 million is reve nue from coal royalty which brought in $10 million and was $1 million lower than budgeted a mount. Also included is freehold mineral rights tax revenue which was $6 7 million and was $20 million lo wer than budget. Industry levies and licences totalled $339 million which primarily includes $308 million fro m AER and $31 million from AUC. Industry lev ies and licences were $3 mill ion over budget due to an increase in orphan levies collected by AER a s part of a three- year plan to address the increase in the number of abandoned wells. Financial Information 76 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 Net Income from Government Business Enterprises Net Income from Government Busines s Enterprises is comprised of the net income from the Balancing Pool of $361 million offset by the net loss from the APMC of $215 million. o The Balancing Pool's net incom e of $361 million in 2018-19 red uced Net Liabilities from an opening balance of $1.2 billion to $829 million as of March 31, 2019. Higher than budgeted Net Income of $200 million was a result of: Increased revenues from sales of electricity due to higher real ized electricity prices. Higher revenues from consumer collection allocation due to incr ease in the collection levy in accordance with regulations. Settlements with a municipal entit y for payments in lieu of tax es (PILOT) revenue in favour of the Balancing Pool. These increases are reduced by an increase in the provision for onerous contracts associated with the return of the Power Pu rchase Arrangements (PPAs) due t o a relative decrease in the forward electricity market price to 2020. o The APMC's net loss of $215 m illion reduced Net Assets from an opening balance of $105 million to a Net Liabilities balance o f $110 million as of March 31, 20 19. The net loss was driven primarily by: Delays in the Sturgeon Refinery meeting the anticipated commerc ial operation date (COD) of June 2018. This has resulted in a lack of operational revenues as anticipated. The COD also coincided with the toll commencement date (TCD) wh ich, per the agreement with the North West Red water Partnership (NWRP), resulted in mo nthly debt tolls to be paid to NWRP to begin (totalling $261 million). Financial Information Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 77 Expenses - Directly Incurred Detailed by Object Salaries, Wages and Employee Benefits , which represented 35 per cent of total operating expense, were the largest compone nt of the ministry's operating expense ($258 million) and primarily support the collection of revenue, development of res ource policy, regulatory work provided by AER and AUC, and the overall support and management of ministry operations. Grants , which represented 29 per cent of total operating expense, wer e the ministry's second largest operating expense ($219 m illion) and primarily consiste d of payments related to Carbon Capture & Storage projec ts ($165 million) and the RRO ra te cap program ($53 million). Supplies and Services totalling $170 million (23 per c ent) primarily consist of ongo ing supply requirements for the mini stry (i.e., contra cts and contr act services, materials and supplies, and shared services pro vided by the Ministry of Servi ce Alberta). Orphan Well Abandonment expenses, totalling $46 million (s ix per cent), relate to the remittance of levies collected on behalf of the Orphan Well Ass ociation for the reclamation of abandoned wells, facilities and pipe lines that are licensed to defunct licensees, as delegated by AER. Other expenses, totalling $52 million (s even per cent), primarily con sist of accretion expenses related to the off coal a greements and amortization of tangible capital assets.

The ministry does not pay interest on the deposits. As of March 31, 2019, the Ministry of Energy has g as royalty deposits of $136 m illion. Coal Phase-Out Agreements The phase out of coal-fired generators is in alignment with the Province's Climate Leadership Plan (CLP). On November 24, 2016, t he Minister of Energy, on behalf of the Province of Alberta, reached agreements with three coal-fired generators to cease operations on or before December 31, 2030. The coal-fired generat ion plants covered under agreements inclu Sheerness and 2; Genesee 1, 2, and 3; and Keephills 3. The Ministry of Energy will mak e payments totalling $97 million ($4 million in dispute) annually to the three generators. The first payment was made July 31, 2017 and payments will continue for the next 12 years. In return, the coal-f ired plants named above will mee t a number of conditions on an annual basis and will cease operations i n the coal-fired electricity g eneration plants on or before December 31, 2030. These conditions are specific to each party, generally requiring each of t he coal-fired generator owner to spend a minimum specified amount in the communities in which the plants were located, along with future specified value of investment and investment related activities in Alberta with respect to the electricity business. The present value of the re maining 12 payments, discounted at 3 per cent (r epresenting the government's average 10-year b ond rate at time of negotiations), is $983 million. The amount of t he draw down over the next five years and thereafter are as follows: Crude by Rail Prepaid expenses of $308 million are prepayments made for railw ay services to Canadian Pacific (CP) Railway and Canadian Natio nal (CN) Railway under the Provi nce's Crude by Rail initiative announced in November 2018. The prepayments were a necessary pa rt of the execution of the contracts and resulted in a r eduction of future toll charges. Annual Payment Principal (in thousands) Financial Information Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 79 Equity in Government Business Enterprise COMMITMENTS (a) North West Redwater Partnership (NWRP) On November 8, 2012 NWRP, announced the sanctioning of the construction of Phase 1 of the Sturgeon Refinery which it will build, own and operate. The APMC has entered into agreements whereby NWRP will process and market Crown roya lty bitumen, or equivalent volumes, collected pursuant to the Bitumen Royalty-in-Kind initiative in order to capture additional value within Alberta. Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission EQUITY IN GOVERNMENT BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (Unaudited)For the year ended March 31, 2019 (in thousands) 2019 2018 Accumulated surplus Opening accumulated surplus 104,999 $ 65,073 $ Revenues Marketing of Oil 5,427 6,508 Financing Transactions 41,678 Total revenue 61,257 48,186 276,366 8,260 Net income for the year (215,109) 39,926 Accumulated surplus at end of year (110,110) $ 104,999 $ Represented by Assets Cash and short-term investments 7,418 $ 7,458 $ Term Loan assets assets 699,351 651,186 Liabilities Accounts payable 26,630 11,272 Due to Government of Alberta 703,819 441,673 Due to the Department of Energy 79,012 93,242 Total liabilities 809,461 546,187 (110,110) $ 104,999 $ Financial Information 80 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 NWRP will market the refined products (primarily ultra low sulphur diesel and low sulphur vacuum gas oil) on behalf of APMC. There is risk to the APMC under these agreements pertaining to the price differential between bitumen supplied as feedstock and marketed refined products, relative to the costs of the processing toll. Under the processing agreement, after the Commerci al Operations Date (COD) is achieved, the APMC is obligated to pay a monthly toll comprised of: senior debt; operating; class A subordinated debt; equity; and incentive fees on 37,500 barrels per day of bitumen (75% of the project's feedstock) for 30 years. The toll includes flow through costs as well as costs related to facility construction, estimated to be $9.9 billion (2018 - $9.7 billion). The APMC has very restricted rights to terminate the agreement, and if it is terminated the APMC remains obligated to pay its share of the senior secured debt component of the toll incurred to date. The term of the commitment began June 1, 2018, at that time the APMC began paying its share of the debt tolls. The debt tolls paid from June, 2018 to March, 2019 totalling $261 million have been expensed. The nominal tolls under the processing agreemen t, assuming an $9.9 billion (2018 - $9.7 billion) Facility Capital Cost, market interest rates and 2% operating cost inflation rate, are estimated below. The total estimated tolls have been increased by $0.69 billion (2018 - $0.07 billion increase) relative to March 2018, due primarily to higher debt tolls related to higher Facility Capital Cost. As at March 31, 2019, NWRP has issued $6.35 (2018 - $6.35) billion in bonds. No value has been ascribed to the anticipated refining prof its available to APMC over the term of the agreement. (b) NWRP Monthly Toll Commitment The APMC has used judgment to estimate the toll commitments. The components of the toll are: senior debt; operating costs; class A subordinated debt; equity; and incentive fees. To calculate the toll, management has used estimates for factors including future interest rates, operating costs, oil prices (WTI and light/heavy differentials), refined product pr ices, gas prices and foreign exchange. NWRP targets the refinery to come on stream to process bitumen feedstock with a commercial operations anticipated to commence late 2019. The future toll commitments are estimated to be: 2019-20 26,715 (c) Term Loan Provided to NWRP As part of the Subordinated Debt Agreement with NWRP, the APMC provided a $439 million loan (2018 - $432 million). These amounts plus the accrued intere st will be repaid on a straight line basis over ten years by NWRP beginning one year after commercial st art-up of the Sturgeon Refinery. Upon initiation of commercial operations the total amount of the term loan will be adjusted to reflect an agreed equity to debt ratio. Financial Information Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 81 While loans to NWRP are outstanding, the APMC is entitled to a 25 per cent voting interest on an Executive Leadership Committee, which is charged with overseeing and making decisions on the construction and start-up of the Sturgeon Refinery. Because of the 25 per cent voting interest, the APMC has significant influence over NWRP. However, the APMC has no equity ownership interest in NWRP and does not account for the Sturgeon Refinery or its operations and financial statements. Under the agreements related to the Facility Capital Co sts for the Sturgeon Refinery, the financing structure is required to be 80 per cent senior debt and 20 per c ent equity/subordinated debt. The APMC is committed to provide 50 per cent of the subordinated debt required to m eet this test. A final reconciliation of the amount of subordinated debt required will be done six months after Co mmercial Operation Date. The calculation of the 80/20 ratio allows for the deduction of cumulative debt service costs (accrued interest) at this time, while prior to this time the calculation does not allow for the deduction of accumulated debt service costs, which could result in a temporary need for additional s ubordinated debt lending by APMC. The APMC is forecasting to provide NWRP no additional subordinated debt in 2019 (2018 - $13 million). In 2020 the APMC anticipates NWRP will repay $90 million (2018 - $94 million) to APMC as part of the final subordinated debt true-up six months after COD. (d) NWRP Processing Agreement Assessment The APMC uses a cash flow model to determine if the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the NWRP Processing Agreement exceed the economic benefits expected to be received. The model uses a number of variables to calculate a discounted net cash flow fo r APMC. Those variables include technical variables that arise from the design of the project su ch as catalyst volumes or energy c onsumption; pricing related variables such as WTI prices, heavy-light diffe rentials, ultra-low sulphur diesel-W TI premiums, exchange rates, capital costs, operating costs, interest rates, discount rates, and operating performance compared to capacity. Technical inputs may be estimated with reasonable accu racy for a particular operating plan. However revenues and costs that depend upon market prices are challenging to es timate, particularly over long future time periods. The Processing Agreement has a term of 30 years and may be renewed for successive five year periods at APMC's option. In order to perform the onerous contract analysis APMC management developed estimates for the key variables based on information from various sources in cluding forecasts of global consultancies, reserve evaluation consultants, forward markets and the Government of Alberta. Based on the analysis, APMC determined the agreement has a positive net present value and no provision is required. (e) Keystone XL Pipeline Project Effective October 30, 2018 APMC has assigned these capac ity agreements to another party. Therefore the APMC no longer has this commitment. (f) Crude by Rail Project On February 14, 2019 the Minister of Energy instructed the APMC, as agent of the Ministry of Energy, to execute a crude by rail program as part of the Government of Alber ta's medium term solution to alleviate the constrained market access for Alberta' heavy crude oil production. T he Department of Energy has evaluated this program Financial Information 82 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 and the contracts thereunder in accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and determined that the APMC is acting as agent for the Department of Energy on all commercial elements. As a result, all financial obligations, risks, and rewards of the program are borne by the Department of Energy. (g) Subsequent Events Short Term Debt On April 4, 2019 APMC replaced its short term debt of $116.1 million originally issued April 4, 2018 with new short term debt of $118.3 million at 1.80% interest due April 2, 2020. On April 25, 2019 APMC borrowed $17.2 million of short term debt from Treasury Board and Finance at an effective interest rate of 1.80% due April 23, 2020. On May 24, 2019 APMC borrowed $16.304 million of short term debt from Treasury Board and Finance at an effective interest rate of 1.820% due May 22, 2020. Financial Information Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 83 The Balancing Pool (1) Included in Accounts payable is $28.0 million (2018 - $61.7 million) of payments in lieu of taxes that are payable to a municipal entity. (2) Loans and borrowing is made up of short-term discount notes issued to the province with maturity dates ranging from 31 to 90 days with annual interest charges ranging from 2.16% to 2.65% (2018 - 1.64% to 1.69%). (3) The increase in Power Purchase Arrangement (PPA) liabi lities is due to the adoption of IFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019 which resulted in the recognition of a lease liability of $298 million (2018 - $nil). (a) Deemed Control The province created the Balancing Pool in 1998 to manage certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses arising from the transition to competition in Alberta's electric industry. The Balancing Pool was established as a separate statutory corporation on June 1, 2003. Financial Information 84 Energy Annual Report 2018-2019 The Balancing Pool is required to respond to cert ain extraordinary events duri ng the operating period of all of the Power Purchase Arrangements (PPAs) such as force majeure, unit destruction, buyer or owner default or termination of a PPA. When a buyer terminates a PPA, the Balancing Pool will assume all remaining rights and obligations pursuant to the PPA assuming the PPA continues. The Electric Utilities Act requires the Balancing Pool to manage generation assets in a commercial manner. A series of legislative and regulatory changes and init iatives culminated in the ministry to be deemed in control of the Balancing Pool for financial reporting purposes with an effective date of January 1, 2017. (b) Measurement Uncertainty These financial statements are primarily based on the financial statements of the Balancing Pool for the year ended December 31, 2018 and unaudited interim financial statements for the period January 1 to March 31, 2019. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions have been made using careful judgement. Actual results are likely to differ from the results derived using thes e estimates. As a consequence, there is a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. (c) Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Terminated Power Purchase Arrangements The Sundance B and C Power Purchase Agreements were terminated effective April 1, 2018 and the Battle River 5 PPA was terminated effective October 1, 2018. Termination notices not been provided to the Owners of the remaining PPAs (Genesee, Sheerness and Keephills) as at March 31, 2019. Retroactive Line Loss Adjustment In December 2017, the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC) reached its decision on Proceeding 790. As a result, the Balancing Pool will incur additional charges as a result of the retroactive adjustments to line loss factors in relation to the various PPAs. An estimated provision in the amount of $45.5 million (2017 - $42.5 million) has been recorded in trade payable and other accrued liabilities for the retroactive line loss adjustment as a result of the AUC's December 2017 decision. The estimate has been prepared using the Module B method based on Incremental Loss Factors with generation scaling. The various matters approved by the AUC regardi ng the retroactive line loss adjustments are under appeal with the Court of Appeal, including the retroac tive nature of the adjustments and prospective line loss factors used to calculate the adjustment. The quantum of any retroactive adjustment will be dependent upon the methodology finally adopted and approv ed. Given the uncertainty of the final methodology, the Balancing Pool estimates may be higher or lower than the current estimate reflected in these financial statements. Payments (Refunds) in Lieu of Tax As a result of a settlement being reached approximatel y $39.1 million was reversed from the previously accrued Payments (Refunds) in Lieu of Tax leaving a balance payable of $28.0 (2018 - $67-1 million to the municipal entity at March 31, 2019.
