Flex Links provide link redundancy with a convergence time of less than 100 milliseconds. IEEE 802.1s/w Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) and Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) provide rapid spanning-tree convergence independent of spanning-tree timers and also offer the benefit of Layer 2 load balancing and distributed processing. Stacked units behave as a single spanning-tree node. Per-VLAN Rapid Spanning Tree (PVRST+) allows rapid spanning-tree reconvergence on a per-VLAN spanning-tree basis, without requiring the implementation of spanning-tree instances. Cisco HSRP is supported to create redundant, fail-safe topologies in 2960-XR Series IP Lite SKUs. Switch-port auto-recovery (Error Disable) automatically attempts to reactivate a link that is disabled because of a network error. Power redundancy with an optional second power supply on 2960-XR Series models, or with an external redundant power supply (RPS) on 2960-X Series models. Operational Efficiency Cisco Catalyst SmartOperations is a comprehensive set of capabilities that simplify LAN planning, deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Deploying SmartOperations tools reduces the time and effort required to operate the network and lowers Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Cisco AutoConfig services determine the level of network access provided to an endpoint based on the type of device. This feature also permits hard binding between the end device and the interface. Cisco Smart Install services enable minimal-touch deployment by providing automated Cisco IOS Software image installation and configuration when new switches are connected to the network. This enables network administrators to remotely manage Cisco IOS Software image installs and upgrades. Cisco Auto SmartPorts services enable automatic configuration of switch ports as devices connect to the switch, with settings optimized for the device type, for zero-touch port-policy provisioning. Cisco Auto-QoS automatically configures QoS, allowing the switch to manage QoS policies based on traffic types, resulting in zero-touch traffic engineering. Auto-QoS supports eight egress queues in the 2960-X and 2960-XR Series. Cisco Smart Troubleshooting is an extensive array of diagnostic commands and system health checks within the switch, including Smart Call Home. The Cisco Generic Online Diagnostics (GOLD) and online diagnostics on switches in live networks help predict and detect failures faster. For more information about Cisco Catalyst SmartOperations, visit [cisco.com/go/SmartOperations](https://www.cisco.com/go/smartoperations). Operational Simplicity Cisco AutoSecure provides a single-line CLI to enable baseline security features (Port Security, DHCP snooping, DAI). This feature simplifies security configurations. DHCP auto configuration of multiple switches through a boot server eases switch deployment. Stacking primary configuration management with Cisco FlexStack-Plus and Cisco FlexStack-Extended technology helps ensure that all switches are automatically upgraded when the primary switch receives a new software version. Automatic software version checking and updating help ensure that all stack members have the same software version. No configuration is required to use Cisco FlexStack-Plus and Cisco FlexStack-Extended modules for stacking (Plug and Play). Autonegotiation on all ports automatically selects half- or full-duplex transmission mode to optimize bandwidth. Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) facilitates dynamic trunk configuration across all switch ports. Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) automates the creation of Cisco Fast EtherChannel groups or Gigabit EtherChannel groups to link to another switch, router, or server. Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) allows the creation of Ethernet channeling with devices that conform to IEEE 802.3ad. This feature is similar to Cisco EtherChannel technology and PAgP. Automatic Media-Dependent Interface Crossover (MDIX) automatically adjusts transmit and receive pairs if an incorrect cable type (crossover or straight-through) is installed. Unidirectional Link Detection Protocol (UDLD) and Aggressive UDLD allow unidirectional links caused by incorrect fiber-optic wiring or port faults to be detected and disabled on fiber-optic interfaces. SDM templates for access, routing, and VLAN deployment allow the administrator to easily maximize memory allocation to the desired features based on deployment-specific requirements. Local Proxy ARP works in conjunction with Private VLAN Edge to minimize broadcasts and maximize available bandwidth. VLAN1 minimization allows VLAN1 to be disabled on any individual VLAN trunk. Smart Multicast with Cisco FlexStack-Plus and FlexStack-Extended technology allows the Cisco Catalyst 2960-X and 2960-XR Series to offer greater efficiency and support for more multicast data streams such as video by putting each data packet onto the backplane only once. IGMP Snooping for IPv4 and IPv6 and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) v1 and v2 Snooping provide fast client joins and leaves of multicast streams and limit bandwidth-intensive video traffic to only the requesters. Multicast VLAN Registration (MVR) continuously sends multicast streams in a multicast VLAN while isolating the streams from subscriber VLANs for bandwidth and security reasons. Per-port broadcast, multicast, and unicast storm control prevents faulty end stations from degrading overall system performance. Voice VLAN simplifies telephony installations by keeping voice traffic on a separate VLAN for easier administration and troubleshooting. Cisco VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) supports dynamic VLANs and dynamic trunk configuration across all switches. Remote Switch Port Analyzer (RSPAN) allows administrators to remotely monitor ports in a Layer 2 switch network from any other switch in the same network. For enhanced traffic management, monitoring, and analysis, the embedded Remote Monitoring (RMON) software agent supports four RMON groups (history, statistics, alarms, and events). Layer 2 trace route eases troubleshooting by identifying the physical path that a packet takes from source to destination. Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) reduces the cost of administering software upgrades by downloading from a centralized location. Network Time Protocol (NTP) provides an accurate and consistent timestamp to all intranet switches. Power Management The Cisco Catalyst 2960-X and 2960-XR Series Switches offer a range of industry-leading features for effective energy efficiency and energy management. They are the greenest switches in the industry. Switch Hibernation Mode (SHM) is an industry first and available on all 2960-X and 2960-XR Series switches. This feature puts the switch in ultra-low-power mode during periods of nonoperation such as nights or weekends. SHM on the 2960-X and 2960-XR Series switches can be scheduled using Cisco EnergyWise\u00ae compliant management software. IEEE 802.3az EEE (Energy Efficient Ethernet) enables ports to dynamically sense idle periods between traffic bursts and quickly switch the interfaces into a low-power idle mode, reducing power consumption. Cisco EnergyWise policies can be used to control the power consumed by PoE-powered endpoints, desktop and data-center IT equipment, and a wide range of building infrastructure. Cisco EnergyWise technology is included on all Cisco Catalyst 2960-X and 2960-XR Series Switches.
