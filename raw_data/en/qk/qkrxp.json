2021 Page: 7640 Page: 7640 COVID-19: Vaccination Dear Chair I refer to your correspondence of 13 May 2021 concerning petition number EN2409. The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation. It is a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death. While research into the long-term effects of COVID-19 vaccines is ongoing, the technologies have been studied for years and used in other treatments without issue. Scientists began creating viral vectors like the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in the 1970s, and mRNA vaccines like Pfizer have been studied before for influenza, rabies and for cancer treatments. Previous research and vaccine rollout demonstrates that severe side effects are extremely rare and, if they if do occur, they usually happen within the first two months. Because of this, scientists and public-health officials continually monitor vaccine data before, during and after a vaccine becomes available to the public. Both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have been tested in clinical trials since mid-2020 and ongoing trials continue to gather new data over time. Trial data has shown excellent safety results. The first few months of safety data is required before approving any new vaccines. This, plus information coming from vaccine recipients across the world, provides confidence that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. All vaccines are thoroughly tested to ensure they are effective before approval by the regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), for use in Australia. Through the TGA, Australia also has a robust system for the ongoing monitoring of vaccine safety. The TGA facilitates a responsive and effective review system to detect any unexpected side-effects from COVID-19 vaccines, if they occur, and ensure they are investigated promptly. This type of monitoring is standard practice in Australia for all vaccines, and draws on Australia's medical expert active and vaccine safety system data gathered through AusVaxSafety. The long-term effects of COVID-19 infection are, however, well-documented. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, common lasting symptoms of COVID-19 infection are fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, joint pain and chest pain. Other issues include cognitive problems, difficulty concentrating, depression, muscle pain, headache, rapid heartbeat and intermittent fever. COVID-19 vaccination has not been made mandatory in Australia by the Government and individuals maintain the option to choose. However, it is important that anyone who can receive a vaccination does so, to help keep themselves and others safe. All individuals must give informed consent before having the COVID-19 vaccine, and anyone with questions about the benefits of being vaccinated is encouraged to talk to their doctor or health professional. Some states and territories have now issued public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people working in certain high-risk workplaces only: Queensland: From 31 March 2021, COVID-19 vaccination is mandatory for all relevant health service employees, Queensland Ambulance Service employees and contractors. Western Australia: From 10 May 2021, COVID-19 vaccination is mandatory to work in Western Australia's hotel quarantine system. It is also possible that in the future, vaccination against COVID-19 might become a requirement for travel to certain destinations, or for people working in certain high-risk workplaces. Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there will be exemptions for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical and other reasons. Australians are encouraged to rely on reputable sources of information to help them make informed choices and stay up-to-date. To this end, my Department has been communicating regularly about the progress, safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, with more information available online at: www.health.gov.au. Thank you for writing on this matter. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mr Hunt "}
