The Florida Legislature granted chiropractors the power to do student physicals (statute 1003.22), and the School Board cannot revoke it. Any judicious attorney would recognize that fact. That same statute excludes chiropractors from writing vaccine exemptions for schools. More: [How to send a letter to the editor](https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/opinion/letters/2020/09/22/herald-tribune-how-send-letter-editor/3492961001/) For a medical or an osteopathic physician to issue a vaccine exemption would require an established physician/patient relationship, which would include a medical evaluation that leads to \"valid clinical reasoning or evidence.\" That relationship would require a well-documented patient chart with a detailed clinical assessment and supporting pathology. A mask exemption would require the same process. The signature of this chiropractor is on over 500 mask exemption forms; a 30-minute exam for 500 patients would take six weeks. As a medical practice risk manager, my advice to the Venice chiropractor is that he find an exceptional health care attorney who specializes in Florida Board of Chiropractic Medicine disciplinary actions; he's going to need one. Paul Sloan, Venice Florida vying to outdo 'Texas Crazy' I'm from Texas. My wife is from Sarasota. Early in the pandemic, the lieutenant governor of Texas declared older folks should be willing to die to preserve a good economy. That gave me the early lead in our debate over which state has the most questionable politicians. But Lynn was confident Florida would fall to the occasion. Local politicians came to her rescue by ignoring the wishes of the people and approving unregulated growth. Gov. Ron DeSantis then solidified Florida's lead by forbidding cruise ships from requiring proof of vaccination and undermining school districts' attempts to protect children. Florida's lead seemed insurmountable when DeSantis dismissed the environmental danger of the former Piney Point fertilizer plant dumping 215 million gallons of wastewater into Tampa Bay. But Texas never quits. The lieutenant governor blamed African Americans for the rise in COVID cases. And Gov. Greg Abbott cemented the comeback by declaring war on women. He commissioned neighbors to inform on what females might be doing with their bodies. And before Florida could get back in the game, Texas decided folks could openly carry firearms without a permit or training. Hopefully, shootouts at Little League games can be kept to a minimum. What can DeSantis come up with next to outdo \"Texas Crazy?\" James Medlin, Sarasota 'Job well done' in ending conflict For two and a half weeks, I watched with astonishment as our armed forces evacuated 124,000 people from Afghanistan. Their steady determination and success, day after day, under dangerous circumstances were nothing short of miraculous. I am dismayed by the armchair quarterbacks who claim that it wasn't good enough and that they could do better. The cheers that broke out as our troops left Afghan airspace were well-earned. To quote Maj. Gen. Chris Donahue, \"Job well done. Proud of you all.\" Toni Welicki, Sarasota Biden's withdrawal a win for Taliban President Joe Biden's withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan was a success. The administration and press said so. So it must be true. Am I to assume that leaving Americans and Afghan allies behind in Taliban-controlled Kabul was one of our goals? How about our weapons and airplanes? Job well done! In this age of participation trophies, Biden did such a good job he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Or, at least, an international Emmy. He definitely deserves a multimillion-dollar book deal. I can see it now: an autobiography titled, \"Joe 'Gandhi' Biden on How to Arm the Taliban.\" Richard Lieb, Sarasota GOP favors unborn over born These days Florida seems to be fighting battles where freedom is pitted against public health. Gov. Ron DeSantis apparently is confused about which side he's on. In his latest move to make sure his base follows him, he's planning to fine any businesses that require proof of vaccination. Since when does a governor have the right to tell a business owner that he cannot ensure the health and safety of his employees and customers? It was also ironic to see the placement of that article, \"Fla. attacks proof of vaccination,\" on the same page as \"GOP to put Texas-style abortion ban on 2022 agenda\" Sept. 3. On the one hand, the GOP wants to protect unborn life, but on the other it disregards life for those already born. Does anyone else feel confused? Josephine Bloom, Sarasota "}
