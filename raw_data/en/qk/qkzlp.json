Dr. Vanderbilt defended his thesis in June 2015. Dan identified a critical mechanism that stabilizes the Gli1 transcription factor and maintains the malignant phenotype of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). He found that the HMG box transcription factor Sox9 binds to the Skp/Cul/Fbox (SCF) E3 ligase component beta-TrCP, and prevents its association Skp1. When Sox9 is suppressed, SCF-beta-TrCP targets nuclear Gli1 for degradation, resulting in loss of CSCs and loss of malignant properties such as tumor cell survival.

These two miRs activator of RAS-ERK through suppression of GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), including RASA1 and the Spred1/NF1 complex. His results provide the rationale for a novel antagomiR-based approach for treatment of cancer, regardless of the RAS mutational status, and may explain the paucity of activating point mutations in RAS genes in certain cancers such as breast cancer. He will receive the MD and PHD degrees following completion of medical school in 2017. - 2015: Mark Farrugia, \"The Diverse Factors 4 and 5 in Breast Cancer\" Mark Farrugia is currently a third year medical student in the WVU MD PhD Program.

Degree: Ph.D. Advisor: Lisa M. Salati, Ph.D. dietary polyunsaturated fat regulates lipogenic gene expression\" Ali completed her Ph.D. in the summer of 2009. Her work established an important mechanism for intracellular regulation by dietary fat. She carried out her postdoctoral work with Dr. Patrick Tso at the University of Cincinnati and successfully obtained a F32 postdoctoral fellowship and a K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award from the NIH. Ali is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University Connecticut. Dr. Kohan's research program focuses on the role of apolipoprotein C-III in mediating inflammatory disease. The canonical role of apolipoprotein (apo) C-III is to inhibit lipid uptake by peripheral tissues and liver, stimulating hypertriglyceridemia. Her lab first reported that overexpression of human apoC-III in mice results in delayed dietary fat absorption and secretion of smaller chylomicrons. Prior to this discovery, all other known effects of apoC-III were deleterious. Genetic variants in apoC-III exist, but there is only one family known to have a complete loss of apoC-III, suggesting a strong evolutionary pressure to retain apoC-III expression. She and her lab have now determined that in addition to the delay in dietary fat absorption, apoC-III overexpression confers significant protection from colitis in mice (induced with dextran-sulfate sodium (DSS), and confers resistance to all associated pathologies including weight loss, colon shortening, macroscopic damage, and pro-inflammatory secretion of IL-17. Major efforts in her research laboratory are focused on: (i) mechanism of apoC-III regulation of intestinal regulatory T cells (Tregs); (ii) the interplay between dietary lipid absorption-chylomicron secretion-and apolipoprotein expression and inflammatory bowel disease; and (iii) the influence of plasma lipoproteins, particularly triglyceride-rich lipoproteins with apoC-III, on intestinal lipid metabolism. The laboratory has extensive experience in intestinal lipid absorption, lipoprotein synthesis and secretion, plasma lipoprotein metabolism, and they developed the primary intestinal organoid model for the study of lipoprotein synthesis and secretion. The overall goal of Dr. Kohan's research is to determine the mechanisms through which intestinal apolipoproteins impact disease in human populations, and the therapeutic implications of this physiology. - 2009: Callee McConnell-Walsh, Ph.D. Dr. Walsh completed her Ph.D. in the Biochemistry & Molecular Biology Graduate Program in Degree: Ph.D. Advisor: Lisa M.Salati, Ph.D. Doctoral Dissertation: \"The effect nutrients upon the activity of SR proteins\" Dr. Walsh's dissertation addressed the molecular mechanisms controlling alternative splicing in response to nutritional stimulation, specifically effects upon the SR protein family of splicing factors.
