The organization's mission is to esta blish, assess and promote recognized standards of competence and safety in acupuncture and Oriental medicine for the protection and benefit of the public. The NCCAOM is the only national organization that validates entry -level competency in the practice of acupuncture and Oriental medicine (AOM) through professional certification . NCCAOM certification or a passing score on the NCC AOM certification examinations are documentation of competency for licensure as an acupuncturist by 43 states plus the District o f Columbia which represents 98 % of the states that regulate acupuncture . All NCCAOM certification programs are currently accredited by the National Commission for Certification Agencies (NCCA). All NCCAOM Certification Programs carry the NCCA seal. In order for the NCCAOM c ertification programs in Acupuncture, Chinese H erbology, Oriental Medicine , and Asian Bodywork Therapy to remain accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA)1, the NCCAOM must adhere to strict national standards for examination development. All Diplomate level certificati on exams must meet examination content validity standards set forth by NCCA. The first step of the examination development process and an ongoing step in examination item bank maintena nce is to conduct a job task analysis (JTA) study also known as a practice analysis. This report describes the rationale, the process and the outcomes of the NCCAOM 2008 Job Tas k Analysis Study conducted for the purpose of validating examination content fo r all NCCAOM certification programs. 1 The National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) is a separate commission of the Institute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE) .

A JTA establishes the link between tasks, test scores and competencies assessed by the examination and thus the inference that the scores achieved by candidates on the certification examinations are based on valid content; t herefore, all \"pass\" or \"fail\" decisions correlate to competency assessment (performan ce) as measured by the examination. The JTA is a process by which certified practitioners are surveyed to gather their perceived importance and frequency of perfor ming a set of job tasks identified by subject - matter experts (SMEs). The Joint Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (American Educational Research Association ( AERA ), American Psychological Association (APA), and (National Council on Measurement in Education ( NCME ), 1999) state: \"When evidence of validity on test content is presente d, the rationale for defining and describing a specific job content domain in a particular way (e.g., elements, knowledge, skills, abilities or other personal characteristics) should be stated clearly \" (Standard 14.10). Further, \"the content domain to be c overed by a credentialing test should be defined clearly and justified in terms of importance of the content for the credential -worthy performance in an occupation or profession. A rationale should be provided to support a claim that the knowledge or skill s being assessed are required for credential -worthy performance in an occupation and are consistent with the purpose for which the licensing or certification program was instituted \" (Standard 14.14). Copyright 20 10 NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved. 7 NCCAOM Exam Development In April of 2008 the NCCAOM se t out to conduct a JTA, to delineate the competencies necessary for testing candidates for the following entry -level certifications: Diplomate in (NCCAOM )). The NCCAOM conducts JTA s, in order to update the examination content outlines. Content decisions for the examination content outlines are directly linked to the results of the JTA. Best practice in validation of examination content is to perform a JTA a minimum of every five years . The NCCAOM's previous JTA was conducted in 2003 for the NCCAOM Acupuncture and Chinese Herbology certificat ion programs. It was during that particular JTA that the Oriental Medicine certification program was developed. After the 2003 JTA was presented to the AOM community, NCCAOM created a set of modular examinations for three of the NCCAOM certification programs - Acupuncture (AC) , Chin ese Herbology (CH) and Oriental Medicine (OM) based on input from key stakeholder groups . A separate Foundations of Oriental medicine (FOM) exam module and a separate Biomedicine (BIO) exam module were introduced in 2004 . The FOM modular exam was developed based on content that was previously contained in the NCCAOM C omprehe nsive Acupuncture exam as well the Comprehensive Chinese Herbology examination and through content validation based on the 2003 JTA . The separation of the foundations of Oriental medicin e content into a separate exam module then resulted in the creation of a separate Acupuncture exam module, as well as a separate Chinese Herbology exam module. At that time a separate Point Location (PL) module was also added as a required exam for candida tes seeking certification in Acupuncture or Oriental Medicine. It should also be noted that in October of 2007, the PL module was combined with the AC module. This change occurred because of the necessity to improve the reliability of the PL exam, based on the comments received from NCCA during the NCCAOM's reaccredidation of the Acupuncture Certification Program and the initial accreditation of the Oriental Medicine Program. Since October 2007 all candidates for these certification programs must successful ly pass the Acupuncture with Point Location (ACPL) module. In 2004 a stand -alone JTA was conducted for the Asian Bodywork Therapy (ABT) examination. That exam continues to be administered as a single comprehensive examination. Refer to the Copyright 20 10 NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved. 8 NCCAOM website www.nccaom.org and use the site map to find both the Job Task Analysis Report 2003 and the Job Task Analysis R eport 2004 - Asian Bodywork Therapy . During t he 2008 JTA study, NCCAOM SMEs - NCCAOM Diplomates who have expertise and experience as a faculty member or practitioner provided the list of knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) statements2 for the tasks supporting the NCCAOM Acupuncture with Point Location (ACPL), Biomedicine (BIO), Founda Oriental and Asian Bodywork Therapy (ABT) content outlines that were currently being used . The 2008 JTA results provide the content validity support and linkage to the examination items (i.e., questions) for all NCCAOM certificati on exams. Table 1, below, shows the examinations required each NCCAOM certification program. Table 1: Examinations Required for Each NCCAOM Certification Program Examination Diplomate of Acupuncture (Dipl. Ac.) Diplomate of Chinese Herbology H.) of Asian Bodywork Therapy (Dipl. ABT) Foundations of Oriental Medicine v v v Acupuncture with Point Location v v Chinese Herbology v v Biomedicine v v v Asian Bodywork Therapy v Historically there have been variations from state to state with respect to scope of practice, such as the extent to which Chinese he rbal m edicine is regulated . Since the regulatory agencies are a primary stakeholder, their varying needs for certification of entry level competency were taken into consideration by the NCCAOM through the utilization of a modular examination system. 2 The KSA statements are the testa ble concepts that candidates would need to posses in order to accomplish performance of the job tasks safely and properly. Copyright 20 10 NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved. 9 The c urrent design of modular examinations has been working effectively since 2004 to accomplish the NCCAOM mission of public safety . In its publication Regulation of Acupuncture : A Complementary Therapy Framework3, the Little Hoover Commission 's consultant c oncluded by stating on page 52 \"...the independent analysis notes that the national examination for medicine uses a phased, modular approach and the \"must -pass\" modules are particularly useful for matters of health, safety and ethics.\" Use of the modular exa m format for testing competency ensures that content in multiple domains must be passed by the candidates in order to achieve certification. During the development of the NCCAOM modular examination format considerable care was given to considering the ty pe of tasks to be included within each of the modules, according to the usual flow of the practitioner -patient interaction ; therefore , those tasks of a professional's preparedness to meet the patient are included in the Biomedicine module which was request ed by regulatory agencies to assure professional preparedness and patient safety competency by NCCAOM Diplomates . Those tasks which relate to information gathering, assessment, analysis of findings and diagnosis are included within either the Foundations o f Oriental medicine or Biomedicine modules - depending upon whether the tasks are traditional Oriental medicine skills or modern biomedicine skills. It was also decided that the development and execution of a patient's treatment plan falls within the modul es associated with the treatment modalities , i.e., acupuncture, Chinese herbology or Asian bodywork therapy, for which the practitioner is seeking certification. Chart 1, below shows the relationship of the job tasks performed by an acupuncture or Oriental medicine practitioner to the content tested on the NCCAOM exam inations . 3 Regulation of Acupuncture : A Complementary Therapy Framework ; Report 175, Little Hoover Commission, September, 2004 , http://www.ca.gov/studies/175/report175.html , accessed 2/7/10.

E xaminatio n items are written to match the content outline. Each item must be \"linked\" to a content area (i.e. domain ) listed on a content outline and written based on the supporting KSA statements. Item writers from around the country assist the NCCAOM Examination Development Committee (EDC ) members to develop new items for the certification examinations. NCCAOM test development staff members and experienced SMEs train the new item writers on how to write NCCAOM acceptable multiple -choice items. The EDCs are compose d of a panel of SMEs, representing practitioners and educators from different regions of the United States and from various practice settings . They meet for the purpose of writing, reviewing, and revising examination items to meet strict content guidelines and test construction standards. The EDC members also select all exam items to be used for testing the competency of the candidates. Once the exam items are approved by the EDC members , the test development staff enters the item(s) into the appropriate i tem bank and codes the items according to the content out line specifications. The EDCs meet at least once annually to review the current and new items. Additionally, each question is reviewed for performance statistics (i.e. , a psychometric evaluation). NCCAOM contracts with Schroeder Measurement Technologies, Inc . (SMT)4 to further assist with the development all NCCAOM certification examinations by providing psychometric consulting for all examination development valid ation studies. SMT also provide s scoring for the NCCAOM examinations as well as the psychometric and research support for the 2008 JTA. 4 Schroeder Measurement Technologies (SMT) is a re search company that employs psychometricians to assist certification organizations with their t est construction validity , and reliability studies. These consultants also provide scoring for certification examinations. Further information on SMT can be found at www.smttests.com .

Refer to Appendix A: NCCAOM Analysis Taskforce Membe rs. The JTA Taskforce members develop ed the survey questionnaire which included the task elements list for each examination. The tasks included in the survey were considered to be a comprehensive list require d for each profession al certification . The sur vey instrument was provided to currently practicing NCCAOM Diplomates in order to inquire about the relative \"importance\" and \"frequency\" of performing their different job tasks. A separate questionnaire to gather confidential data regarding the demographi c and practice characteristics of the survey respondents was also developed. NCCAOM staff worked with SMT consultants to create the task rating scales. The following two rating scales were used to rate the comprehensive list of task elements for each certi fication examination. Frequency Scale How frequently do you perform this task in your practice? 1 = Rarely (<10% of Patients) 2 = Sometimes (10 -39% of Patients) 3 = Often (40 -59% of Patients) 4 = Usually (60 -80% of Patients) 5 = Always (> 9 0% of Patients) Importance Scale How important is being competent in this task when considering a practitioner 's safe and effective performance? 1 = Of No Importance 2 = Of Little Importance Copyright 20 10 NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved . 3 = Moderately Important 4 = Very Important 5 = Extremely Important Demographic and Practice Setting Questions Development : In order to provide insight into the respondents' years of experience, geographic location, practice setting and other pertinent information, the survey instrument included a de tailed demographic and practice characteristic questionnaire. These survey questions were produced by the NCCAOM taskforce members for the purpose of gathering demographic and professional practice information. See Appendix B: 2008 JTA Survey Questionnaire : Demographic Section and Tasks Sub -Sections for a copy of the complete questionnaire. Survey Administration: NCCAOM staff worked with SMT staff to convert the survey instrument into an online survey instrument. D uring the month of April 2008, email invitations were sent to all active NCCAOM Diplomates requesting their participation in an online survey. The email request was sent to over 18,000 active Diplomates. The email was received and opened by 4,319 Diplomates. A total of 732 Diplomates completed all or some of the individual sections of the questionnaire for an overall response rate of 16.9%. A total of 301 Diplomate respondents indicated that they were certified during the last one to five years. Results Profile of Diplomate Respo ndents NCCAOM C ertifications Held , Type of Practitioner and Current Role : The majority of the Diplomate respondents hold a Dipl. Ac. Certification (57.9 %) followed Diplomate of ABT ; the rem ainder of the respondents hold various multiple certifications or a single Dipl. C.H. The Diplomate of O.M. began in 2004; therefore these Diplomates have received their certification within t he previous four years. Graph 1, below shows the number of Diplo mate respondents by type of NCCAOM certifications held . When asked \"what do you consider yourself to be? \" 40.7% listed \"Acupuncturist\", 55.9 % Copyright 20 10 NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved. 14 \"Oriental medicine 3% \"other\". When asked \" what is your said 1.6% were currently not practicing AOM. Graph 1 : Demographic Profile of Ninety -four p ercent (93.7%) of Diplomate respondents hold one state license as an acupuncturist or AOM practitioner; 6.3% indicate that they hold multiple state licenses. Of the 6 .3% who hold multiple state licenses, 20% hold two, 4.2% hold three and 1 % hold four. Seven percent (7 .3%) of the Diplomate respondents also hold a massage ther apy license , Copyright 20 10 NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved. 15 followed by 5.2% who hold a license as a Registered Nurse. To a lesser extent, licensed Naturopath ic Doctors , Chiropractors , Psychologists and Medical Doctors also hold NC CAOM certifications. Other allied health professionals that have gone on to become AOM practitioners include physical therapists, occupational therapists, physici an assistants, social workers and medi cal technologists. See Graph 2 below for more detail on those Diplomates who hold a license to practice in another health profession.

The Masters degree is the minimum degree currently required to graduate from an Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM) accredited program in AOM . Some Diploma tes, such as Medical Doctors have entered the AOM profession with their previous degree and thus have earned a higher academic degree. Refer to G raph 5 below for more detail.

MD Ph.D. NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved. 18 Tradition/Style Taught: From the graph below it can be seen that the primary tradition (style of practice) taught in the academic programs is traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) at 83.9%. Worsley Five Element theory was indicat ed 7.2% of the time . Collectively 8.7% of the Diplomates received training in various other traditions which include other traditions . The \"other\" category includes French, Korean, Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese. Graph 6: Demographic Profile of Diplomate R espondents: Primary 7.2% TCM Other Worsley Five Element Copyright 20 10 NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved. 19 Student Loans and Income: While in their academic program Diplomate respondents indicated that they spent on average about $ 55,984 for their student loans. Some graduates had loans as much as $1 00,000 once they graduated. The financial burden resulting from the loan debt of these Diplomates averages $45,891 (mean debt level for all respondents) . Average gross income a year is less than $60,000 per year for 70.1% of the Diplomate res pondents. Twenty -one percent (21.2 %) stated that they earn bet ween $60,000 and $120,000 and 8.7% earn over $121,000 per year. See G raph 7 below for more detail on annual gross income . Pearson Chi -Square analysis revealed that gross annual income was signif icantly related to hours worked (p<0.0001) and years in practice (p< 0.0001) . Of the 301 Diplomates who received their certification within the last five years 80.7% earned less than $60,000, 15% earned between $61,000 and $120,000. The highest earnings gr oup was Diplomates who received their certification within the last 11 -15 years. Although men reported overall greater earnings then women, the Pearson Chi -Square analysis (p<1.06) was not significant.

Forty -six states were represented by the Diplomate survey respondents. Forty -one percent (41.1%) of the Diplomate respondents were from New York, California, Colorado, Washington or Florida. Of the \"Far West \" states, California has the highest number of Diplomate respondents followed by Washington and then Colorado. In the Northeast region mo re than 45% of the respondents are licensed and practice in New York, followed by Massachusetts and then Pennsylvania. More than 25% of the Diplomates from the Southern region of the country are from Florida, followed by Maryland and then Virginia. In the Midwest, the state with the most Diplomates is Wisconsin followed by Illinois and then Minnesota. Graph 8 below shows that the majority of the Diplomates practice in the \"Far West \" states .

However, t hirty percent ( 30.1%) are both self -employed and working for someone else. Graph 10, below shows the primary practice settings for the Diplomates who work in other practice settings as an employee, or contractor . Approximately 58% of the Diplomates who are not exclusively in solo practice, work in e ither a multidisciplinary group practice with other health care providers or with other AOM practitioners.

It is not know n from this survey why so many work part-time; however, some survey respondents indicated that they prefer to work fewer hours, while other indicated that they prefer to work more hours per week. Forty -seven percen t (47.3%) prefer to work part -time, while 52.7% prefer to work full - time. This practice characteristic warrants further study to better understand and interpret these findings. In their practice settings 19.2% work less than 10 hours per week. Twenty perce nt (20.3%) work between 11 and 20 hours per week; another 19.7% work between 21 and 30 hours per week; 22.1% work 31 to 40 hours per week, while 18.6% work gre ater th an 40 hours per week. Refer to G raph 11 below for more detailed information regarding hour s worked per week compared to preferred hours of work per week.

Although the majority of the Diplomates spend the majority of their time practicing TCM, it is significant to note that other traditions or styles are learned and practiced after graduation. Many practitio ners, therefore, practice more than one tradition or style.

Copyright 20 10 NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved. 26 Percentage of Time Using Various Treatment Modalities: Diplomates were asked in the past six months, during a typical workweek, what percentage of time they spe nt treating patients using different modalities. It appears that Diplomates most frequently (6 8.2%) provide acup uncture as a treatment modality ; however, acupuncture and Chinese herbology treatments are used collectively over 84.3% of the time. Graph 14 be low provides more detail on the use of various treatment options .

The graph below shows clearly that musculoskeletal pain is the m ost frequent presenting symptom, for which initial treatment is sought, follow ed by reproductive system disorders. Other conditions appear to be treated by Diplomates with approximately the same frequency .

Graph 1 6 shows that overall the Diplomates perceive that they were best prepared to us e their acupuncture skills followed by preparedness to perform moxabustion, el ectro -acupuncture, or cupping. Diplomate respondents believe that they are satisfactory prepared overall to perform Chinese herbology and Asian bodywork therapy after graduation. Graph 16, on the other hand shows that Diplomates believe new practitioners their academic program did prepare them as well, overall for other practice related skills such as collaboration with healthcare providers, practice management, marketing, public relations efforts, risk management, and legal or ethical issues. Note: These results are based on all Diplomate respondents. Some academic programs do not include course work in Asian Bodywork Therapy.

The NCCAOM requires 60 continuing education units (CEU) or professional development acti vity points every four years. This outcome indicates that the average Diplomate earns double the required CEUs need for the four -year recertification requirement. Survey Adequacy and Reliability Response Adequacy: At the end of each exam subsection of t he JTA survey Diplomates were asked to indicate how \"adequately\" or how \"completely\" the survey tasks covered important elements for an entry -level practitioner , which was defined as someone in their first two years of practice. All task elements were perc eived as adequately or completely reflective of entry -level practice by 94% to 98% of the Diplomate respondents depending upon the specific sub -content area evaluated. Refer to F igures 1 -5 below which represent this data and respondent choices. Diplomate r espondents were also invited to suggest task elements not included in the list of task elements.

Inferences from the AC, BIO, CH, and FOM survey subsections appear to have very minimal error (standard error = SE) due to a stable sample size. The inferences from the Asian Bodywork Therapy ( ABT) subsection carry a higher error ra te owing to the low sample size; however, the full ABT examination content outline is derived from both the FOM and ABT survey sub -section . Only the \"Apply Treatment\" domain was derived from the ABT survey sub -section. Noteworthy is the fact that t he majority of the task elements for the ABT content outline are derived from the FOM task element list. Statisticians from SMT additionally calculated reliability estimates to evaluate the amount of error associated with each survey subsection responses to determine amount of agreement among respondents. A statistic known as the alpha coefficient was calculated to provide a meas ure of the internal consistency of the survey. The estimates are affected by the number of questions and the number of respondents. Alpha coefficients range from \"0\" to \"1\", a value greater than 0.70 is considered adequate. SMT also calculated a second rel iability statistic called intra-class correlation to establish reliability estimates for the respondent group raters. Any value above 0.90 is considered good. All examination sub -sections had \"good\" to \"excellent\" intra -class rater reliability. Refer to Ta ble 2, below for a summary of all response reliability data.

These results were sent to all the JTA Taskforce members for their review a week before each group met . All task elements were sorted by overall mean importance and importance by geographic region , years of experience and primary practice s etting . All four mean ratings for each task were used to determine task inclusion /exclusion decisions or assigning of domain weightings . See Appendix C-G: Tasks Elements Sorted by Mean Importance Rating s for: Acupuncture, Biomedicine, Chinese Herbology, Fo undations of Oriental Medicine and Asian Bodywork Therapy . Also p rovided in these appendices are all mean task ratings by overall importance, geographic region, years of experience and primary practice setting s. To evaluate the importance of each \"Domain \" toward practice, each Diplomate respondent was also asked \"what percentage of the exam items would you assign to each area (i.e. , domain) based on its importance?\" Refer to Appendix H: Mean Domain Weighting s Proposed by Diplomate Respondents for a compila tion of all domain weights proposed for each exam content outline. JTA Taskforce Decisions for Task Exclusions : During the month of June 2008 , SMT conducted a series of meetings to review the results for each c ontent area of the JTA with members of the JTA Taskforce . A few days prior to the individual meetings, the taskforce members received a copy of the survey analysis report from SMT. Separate meetings were held to review the results for each examination. The goals of the meetings were to deter mine cr iteria for task exclusions , finalize content domain weights , and approve all KSA statements. The taskforce members based their decisions on the following analysis: Mean overall importance rating (Rule 1) for each task, followed by sub-group demographic ana lysis mean importance by : geographic region ; years of experience and type of practice setting (Rule 2) . Once the decision criteria for element exclusions were determined and applied, the JTA members and all the EDC members applied their holistic review of these respondent ratings and considered other survey respondents comments as to whether to add or delete any additional tasks to the final list (Rule 3). Refer to Table 2: Number of Tasks Excluded Based on Decision Rules Applied by JTA Copyright 20 10 NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved. 35 Taskforce Members for an accounting of the tasks removed or added based on application of decision Rules 1-3. Table 3: Provides the mean importance rating cut -off value for exclusion of task for each examination sub -section . Tasks were excluded based on the pre -determined cut - off value for mean \"overall importance \" (Rule 1). The taskforce members applied further exclusion criteria based on the \"geographic region \", \"years of practice \" and \"primary practice setting \". A task was eliminated if the mean value fell below the mean cu t-off value (see Table 3) in more than one region of the country. Also the mean task rating for years of experience had to meet or exceed the cut -off value for those practicing zero to five years. Finally when applying Rule 2, tasks were eliminated if the mean importance rating for the primary practice setting did not include solo practice since the majority of the practitioners are in solo practice. Refer to Appendices C -G for a list of all mean task ratings: overall, by geographic region, by years of experience and by primary practice setting.

The domain weightings relate to the percentages of examination content tested for each examination sub - section. The JTA members first considered the mean domain weightings given by the Diplomate respondents for each exam (See Appendix H: Mean Domain Weightings Proposed by Diplomate Respondents). The JTA members also considered their expertise in the field before assigning the final weightings for each exam content outline. New Content Outlines : The final step in preparing the new content outlines was for each EDC Committee to consider the decisions from each JTA Taskforce sub -group. During this process the EDC members discovered that there was overlapping content for the Biomedicine and Foundations of Oriental medicine exam content outline s. Therefore, in Marc h 2009 , a separate meeting was held between the EDCs and the JTA Taskforce sub -groups assigned to these two examinations to reallocate all the \"wester n medicine\" content to the Biomedicine exam content outline. It wa s also determined at that time that the examination specifications remain the same for all examinations except the b iomedicine, which went from a 50 -item exam to a 100 -item exam beginning January 1, 2010. All EDCs slightly revised or add ed KSAs to the task lists as needed for further clarity. The final Content Outlines appear in Appendix J. The new ABT content outline was published in November of 2008 for a May 2009 examination administrat ion. The ABT content outline was derived from the task analysis review fr om both the Copyright 20 10 NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved. 38 Foundations of Oriental Medicine and ABT subsections of the survey. Members of th e JTA Taskforce representing Asian bodywork therapy assigned their final domain weightings separately from the members of the FOM. All the other new content outlines were published in April of 2009 for the 2010 examination administrations, following a joint meeting of the Foundations of Oriental Medicine and Biomedicine to move overlapping West ern medicine content into the Biomedicine content outline. Table 4 below shows a comparison of the previous content outline domains and the new content outline domains . Appendix I provide s a list of all tasks and accounting of their inclusions or exclusion s based on applying all decision criteria (i.e. rules) and considering the expert opinion of the JTA Task force and EDC members .

Since the field of AOM is evolving all the time, it is extremely importa nt to continually review and up date the content of the examination s. The goal of all current NCCAOM c ertification exams is to document entry - level competency. This report serves to provide the examination conte nt validity verificat ion for the years 2009 though 2013. This JTA report additionally serves as a useful resource for AOM c ommunity leaders and for policy makers concerned with public safety in the realm of AOM . Some potential uses for validation of these competencies are as follows: To track changes in the job tasks performed by professional acupuncturists and practitioners of Oriental medicine, Chinese herbolog ists and Asian bodywork therapist s over time . To provide information on competencies to AOM educational instit utions as their faculty plan and develop curricula for entry -level and advanced professional training. To inform state association leaders and regulators who enter into discussions concerning changes in state regulations and scope of practice . To provide the AOM community leaders, federal agencies and the public with a snapshot of current demographic parameters and practice characteristics of Diplomates of Acupuncture, Chinese Herbology, Oriental Medicine and Asian Bodywork Therapy. Addit ionally, this document may provide policy makers with information necessary to contrast the depth and bread th of AOM competencies between l icensed acupuncturists who hold NCCAOM certification and those health care professionals who desire to practice AOM aft er an abbreviated training program laid on top of their foundational degree in another health related discipline ( e.g. Medical Doctor , Chiropractic Doctor , Naturopathic Doctor ). Copyright 20 10 NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved. 43 Potential Future Research : The workforce and demographics component of thi s JTA study provides significant new information concerning the hours worked per week as an AOM practitioner, the percentage of new vs. returning patients and the percentage of time spend using various treatment modalities. Each of these findings offers op portunity for additional research. This JTA document and the work it represents form a solid base for such further research. The findings of this study concerning th e range of income produced by AOM practi tioners are most influenced by the \"number of hours worked per year\" although the majority of the Diplomate respondents report earnings of $60,000 per year or less. Further study is needed to determine if those earning $61,000 or more annually have different practice models. It might be discovered that the re are levels of the intensity with which practitioners pursue their career , especially since some practitioners indicated that they wish to work fewer hours and others indicated that they wish to work more hours per week . Although the majority of Diplom ates spend their time practicing TCM, the findings suggest that other traditions or styles are learned and practiced after graduation. Academic institutions planning post -graduate curricula may wish to investigate this further. Additionally, curriculum developers in the AOM schools should consider the information gained on perceptions of the Diplomates' \"perceived preparedness \" for both their core competencies (i.e., acupuncture therapy, foundations of Oriental medicine, herbology and Asian bodywork therapy ) as well as their practice management competencies (marketing, legal, ethics, etc.) the latter of which was ranked across the board lower than the core competency preparation. The results of this JTA show that most practitioners of AOM are working in sol o/private practice. Logically, if 8 9% of respondents in the JTA are in solo practice, then the NCCAOM examinations content are more weighted toward documenting a candidate's competence in the private practice setting. In other words, the tasks and the asso ciated knowledge, skills and abilities are those performed predominantly by a solo practitioner in private practice. This finding necessarily shapes the contents of the exam and creates an exam which is useful to state regulators for the purpose of licensi ng practitioners to work in private practice. There is, however, the situ ation that AOM can be practiced or utilized in many other settings. Noteworthy is that the NCCAOM Diplomates are working more in other practice settings in 2008 compared Copyright 20 10 NCCAOM\u00ae - all rights reserved. 44 to 2003 when the previous NCCAOM JTA was performed. See the 2003 JTA (in PDF format ) on the NCCAOM website.5 In the 2003 JTA there was the evidence of how more biomedical tasks were being performed by Diplomates in practice. This resulted in the addition of more exam items in the domain of biomedicine an d in fact , the NCCAOM began the Biomedicine exam module to adequately test those competencies. In this JTA, although a few more biomedical tasks found their way into the current task list, it is in the area of Chinese H erbology that we see the greatest shift at this time. There is inclusion of more tasks associated with the proper maintenance and pr ocessing of herbs. The Chinese H erbology EDC members continue to find it challenging to reference exam items with acceptable and commonly available texts, just as previously the Biomedicine EDC members had to give considerable attention to proper referencing of biomedical exam items in commonly available texts of the appropriate level of difficulty. We see, in these changes of tasks and KSAs, the evolution of the AOM profession in the U nited States . Overall, there has been relatively little change in the tasks performed by entry -level practitioners in the last ten years. 5 www.nccaom.org/sitemap/200 3JTA Appendix A: NCCAOM 2008 Job Task Analysis Taskforce Members Volunteers Vicki Brown Adam Burke Nan Cameron Michael Casper Claire Cassidy Susan Chapman Bryn Clark Ruth Dalphin Jonathan Daniel Weiyi Ding Barbra Steve Jason Hao Thomas Haines Tess Hahn Ewa Hammer Yuxin He Penny Heisler Lawrence Howa rd Denise Hsu Marian Hughes Anne Jeffres Daniel Jiao John F .
