It's an entirely natural process that forms the basis of naturopathic medicine or naturopathy - a type of holistic healthcare that encourages optimal health through using natural therapies and high-potency nutritional supplements and herbal remedies. This concept also lies at the heart of nutritional therapy - an evidence-based practice that identifies potential nutritional imbalances contributing to symptoms presentation and provides personalised, realistic, practical and achievable therapeutic food plans and lifestyle interventions to support one's health goals. As the field of naturopathy, nutrition and modern science has developed, more diagnostic tests are also available to better understand the underlying root causes of disease and illnesses. At IMI, our naturopaths and nutritional therapists maintain high standards through a programme of ongoing training and mentoring. Consultations are available in-clinic in Hong Kong, or online, from HK, Singapore, or wherever it is in the world that you call home. Disease affects the entire body not just a specific organ or system and as every person is unique they require individualised care. So, when treating the cause of any condition a naturopathic doctor carefully evaluates and addresses not only your physical symptoms but also your nutritional status, genetics, family history, lifestyle, feelings, environmental stresses, social status, spiritual outlook and other factors. \"We use the healing power of nature and functional medicine to treat the whole person\" Naturopathic medicine focuses on restoring and supporting the powerful and intelligent healing ability of the body, mind, and spirit. At IMI we identify the underlying root causes of disease and illnesses through clinical and laboratory diagnostic testing, including Functional Medicine. [See the full range of tests](#) Diagnostic testing including the basis of Functional Medicine are sometimes used to help us to assess more accurately what may be going on. Unlike functional medicine, naturopathic medicine also includes the wider view and treatment of the whole person with natural treatments, herbs, remedies and supplements for deeper healing. Nutrition also plays a key part in any treatment, which is why a naturopath often tests for alterations in a person's gut microbiome (yeast, bacteria, parasites etc.) along with checking for food intolerances. Based on these results and by removing any obstacles to recovery, they then design a personalised treatment and diet plan in order to prevent problems in the future. Additional healing treatments therapies practised as part of naturopathic medicine include: - herbal medicine - detoxification - homeopathy - counselling - hormone and DNA testing - motivational coaching and lifestyle practises \"Like a GP, naturopaths will often refer to other health-care professionals such as osteopaths, counsellors, psychologists, and acupuncturists. When needed, naturopaths will sometimes refer patients to medical doctors for treatment.\" In some cases, especially when a person wants to enjoy excellent health in the long-term, comprehensive hormone testing may be carried out before the treatment programme begins. This involves the naturopathic doctor examining a person's DNA in order to assess possible risk factors and inherited genetic susceptibility to certain conditions. They can then intervene and tailor their advice accordingly on diet and supplements. The balancing and rejuvenating effects of naturopathic therapies are effective for many acute and chronic health problems. Some of these include: - Digestive issues like bloating, pain and constipation - Anxiety, low mood and stress - Skin problems - Poor immunity: colds, cough and flu - Headaches - Poor sleep and fatigue including chronic fatigue - Hormonal imbalances, PMS, menopause - Supporting pregnancy and reproductive health - Sinus troubles, including symptoms of hayfever Rather than simply managing or suppressing symptoms of disease and illness, a naturopathic doctor's primary goal is to determine and treat the underlying causes and support the systems of the body and mind to heal. Some factors include: - Diet and nutritional deficiencies - Food intolerances - Lifestyle habits and poor sleep - Previous medical treatments and drugs - Mental and emotional factors We import potent herbal and botanical medicines for both short and long-term treatment for a wide range of illness. You can be reassured to know that all our herbal tinctures and liquids are independently-tested, clinical-grade and formulated to higher standards in purity and potency; made in Australia under strict, government-controlled GMP standards. We choose organic wherever possible. We also use European and North American herbal capsules and high quality nutritional supplements, which are standardised in potency and in safe to prescribe dosages. At IMI we never stand still. Our naturopaths meet regularly as a team to assess, review and learn about the latest diagnostic methods, herbs and medicines. Is naturopathy licensed? Did you know that while many therapists claim to be practicing 'natural' or 'holistic' medicine, there are only a handful of accredited institutions for naturopathic medicine? Certified naturopathic medicine practitioners are known as Naturopathic Physicians (N.D.) in North America and Europe, whereas in Australia, they are licensed as Naturopaths. Under these rigorous programmes, they receive the same basic science education as medical doctors and must pass professional board exams. At IMI, our naturopathic medicine practitioners are qualified N.D.s or Naturopaths, and are all certified by the Integrated Naturopathic Association of Hong Kong - which is a full member of the World Naturopathic Federation. In North America, certified naturopathic physicians can also perform intravenous therapy, minor surgeries, and prescribe prescription-only medicines. The initial consultation is very thorough and takes about an hour. Your practitioner will examine for signs and symptoms of potential allergies, review your diet, stress levels and lifestyle imbalances. They will then prescribe tailored treatments that aim to remove any underlying problems, such as high levels of toxins. Treatment may include an individualised liquid herbal extract preparation, nutritional supplements and changes to make to your diet. It may also be necessary to perform blood and urine tests as well as stool, digestive, hormone, or allergy analyses to pinpoint the exact health issues. Follow-up consultation Follow-up sessions normally take half an hour. This is when the practitioner checks on how your prescribed treatment is working, and/or explain in some detail the results from any laboratory tests or diagnosis. They'll take the time to explain the important role diet and lifestyle plays on your health and give you a realistic idea of how long any changes you make will take to work - to ensure that both they and you are happy with the results. Further sessions Along with being coached through healthy lifestyle changes, follow-up sessions will check on the healing effects of the therapies as they go through several stages to restore your body's organs. These may involve detoxification, nutritional repair and restoring balance. Depending upon your individual policy, you may be covered for certain tests or treatments. IMI's medical doctors are especially helpful for this as they have some understanding of the range and type of tests that may be recommended from a naturopathic perspective. You can call our reception team for more information or to book a consultation with one of our medical doctors for referrals needed for [diagnostic laboratory tests](#) or specialist medical or healthcare services. The food we eat has a profound impact on our health. Intuitively, most cultures recognise that food has the capability to heal or to harm. Clinical research into nutrition shows that what and how we eat can be used not only to promote health and well-being, but also to prevent illnesses and help those with chronic disease improve outcomes. Nutrition is not about fad diets, but about a balanced relationship with food that provides optimal support for your individual health needs. The nutrients we consume are information used to make hormones, neurotransmitters, create energy, support immunity, brain health, detoxification, optimise gut function and ultimately maintain balance. At IMI, our nutritional therapists are trained to understand how nutrients, food and lifestyle factors influence the function of the body and may contribute to individual symptoms and health concerns. Nutritional therapy is focused around an individual client, with therapists creating a personalised dietary strategy for each client. Each therapeutic plan takes into account not just the specific condition or symptoms presentation, but also a range of other factors including underlying nutritional deficiencies, individual biochemical response to foods, genetic predispositions, environmental stressors, patient's health goals and motivations, as well as personal preferences and constraints. Such personalised plans help create the most appropriate and effective wellness strategy for each individual patient. What's next?
