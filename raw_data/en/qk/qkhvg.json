Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter http://icam-i2cam.org/index.php/about/ The Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter was established to identify major new research themes in complex adaptive matter and to nucleate collaborative research and scientific training in different fields and institutions. A substantial award from NSF enabled the establishment of the International Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter (I2CAM) as an integral part of ICAM, t o c o n t i n u e a n d e x p a n d I C A M ' s international scientific and educational activities. The ICAM-I2CAM network currently has 31 US and 36 overseas branches, including NCBS. ICAM funds research on emergent behaviour and phenomena in biological matter (membranes, protein aggregates, DNA), soft matter (liquid crystals, colloidal suspensions, and polymer blends) and quantum matter (strongly correlated electron systems and high-temperature superconductors). There is now a fresh call for post-doctoral fellowships for a submission deadline of 9 December 2011. As many as 4-5 postdoctoral fellows will be awarded in the fields of quantum matter, biological matter, soft matter (including chemical and biochemical matter), or emergent materials in energy. Guidelines for the scheme are available at http://icam-i2cam.org/index.php/awards/. Other funding streams of relevance include: ICAM/I2CAM Junior Exchange Awards I2CAM/ICAM Junior Travel Awards ICAM Frontier Symposia ICAM/I2CAM Exploratory and Advanced Workshops While the post-doctoral fellowships and exchange awards need to be held at two participating ICAM branches, the travel awards (up to 2500 USD) can be used to fund travel to meetings.
