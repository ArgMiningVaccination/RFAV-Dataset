Each crystal has been hand-picked, cleansed by the moon and enriched with Reiki energy. Why have these crystals been selected? These crystals are all perfect for the soul star, crown, third eye and throat chakra. [Amethyst](https://crystallinewellness.com.au/crystal-encyclopedia/amethyst/) helps to rid any negative thoughts while working on intuition and spiritual awareness. It calms and stimulates the mind, helping you become more focused, enhancing memory and improving motivation. Angelite helps access protection from your guardian angels, wise words from your messenger angels, and divine love from your archangels. It's the celestial experience that your body, mind, and soul have been craving. [Clear Quartz](https://crystallinewellness.com.au/crystal-encyclopedia/clear-quartz/) will rid any energy blocks and allow energy to flow free throughout all chakras. When placing a Quartz crystal on the Third Eye during meditation, one will notice an increased sense of clarity and focus. This clarity and focus will allow one to achieve the \"empty\" state of mind necessary for effective meditative states. Iolite is an excellent meditation tool that can help calm down emotions and still your mind. It is one of the best stones to have when it comes to spiritual healing. [Selenite](https://crystallinewellness.com.au/crystal-encyclopedia/selenite/) provides a pure white light vibration which is amplified during meditation and elevates the conscious mind, for some even claiming to access realms beyond the third dimension. *This pack includes a Pink Velvet Bag along with Information Cards *Crystals are a natural stone and therefore may vary in size and shape. This is a natural quality of the material, not a fault. "}
