I have had mixed opinions when I have shared my intere...", "sitename": "Mumsnet", "date": "2011-12-15", "cleaned_text": "I have used alternative medicine - aromatherapy, massage, acupuncture, etc. and definitely believe that they have helped speed healing when used in conjunction with modern medicine. For instance I was told I would need 6 weeks off work after a back operation, the first 4 to be in bed - I was up and about the day after as soon as the HCPs would let me off the bed, and back at work within 2 weeks. I could have gone back earlier but the GP wanted to play it safe and wouldn't sign me back on. My mother also used alternative medicine, again in conjunction with modern medicine, when she had breast cancer. She saw a fully medically qualified herbalist (NCMH) - they have several years intensive training and are aware of contraindications, etc. It certainly gave her a psychological boost and was also able to lessen some of the more unpleasant side effects of chemotherapy - a few drops of tincture of myrrh in a glass of water, used as a mouth wash, is an alternative and effective treatment for thrush. Reiki I believe is the pyramid selling of the New Age world, though now most people will 'attune' for free. In the early days it was a case of \"Pay \u00a36,000 to get your Reiki III Master and then you can charge other people \u00a36,000 each to get theirs\". I do believe there is something there with Reiki, but it's not something I've ever been comfortable with. I am even more cynical about crystals. How can something that has been blasted from the ground (possibly in life-threatening conditions for those finding them), polished in a commercial setting and then flogged for many times its value in a hippy shop, have any healing properties? I treat them as pretty rocks which are pleasing to look at. So I think my answer is that some alternative therapies can be very effective, some are probably working on the placebo effect. I'd be interested if any of the sceptics who have joined the thread have ever come across any papers on the placebo effect. Why is it that sometimes the body can literally seem to 'fix itself' just because of a thought process? Have any scientists ever investigated quite how this happens? I'd love to read more on that. "}
