Please be sure to choose only providers marked as KP Select providers in the Kaiser Permanente Provider Directory. You can get a copy of the directory by calling Member Services . You can also get a list by visiting our website. Go to kp.org , then click on \"Doctors & Locations .\" Choose KP Select on the \"Health Plan\" filter. Appendix A (01 -22) Surprise Billing \u2014 Know your rights Beginning January 1, 2020, Colorado state law protects you from \"surprise billing .\" This is sometimes called \"balance billing\" and it may happen when you receive covered services, other than ambulance services, from an out -of-network provider in Colorado. This law does not apply to all health plans and may not apply to out- of-network pr oviders located outside of Colorado. Check to see if you have a \"CO -DOI\" on your ID card; if not, this law may not apply to your health plan. What is surprise/balance billing and when does it happen? You are responsible for the cost -sharing amounts required by your health plan, including copayments, deductibles , and/or coinsurance. If you are seen by a provider or use services in a hospital or other type of facility that are not in your health plan's network, you may have to pay additional costs associated with that care. These providers or services at hospitals and other facilities are sometimes referred to as \"out -of-network .\" Out-of-network hospitals, facilities , or providers often bill you the difference between what Kaiser Permanente decides is the eligible charge and what the out -of-network provider bills as the total charge. This is called \" surprise\" or \"balance\" billing. When you CANNOT be balance -billed: Emergency Services When you receive services for emergency medical care, usual ly the most you can be billed for emergency services is your plan's in -network cost -sharing amounts, which are copayments, deductibles, and/or coinsurance. You cannot be balance- billed for any other amount. This includes both the emergency facility and any providers you may see for emergency care. Non- emergency Services at an In- Network or Out -of-Network Facility The hospital or facility must tell you if you are at an out -of-network location or at an in- network location that is using out - of-network providers. It must also tell you what types of services may be provided by any out -of-network provider. You have the right to request that in -network providers perform all covered medical services. However, you may have to receive medical se rvices from an out -of-network provider if an in -network provider is not available. When this happens, the most you can be billed for covered services is your in -network cost -sharing amount (copayments, deductibles, and/or coinsurance). These providers cannot balance bill you. Additional Protections Kaiser Permanente will pay out -of-network providers and facilities directly. Again, you are responsible only for paying your in- network cost -sharing for covered services. Kaiser Permanente will count any amount you pay for emergency services or certain out -of-network services (described above) toward your in -network deductible and out -of-pocket limit. Your provider, hospital, or facility must refund any amount you overpay within 60 days of y our reporting the overpayment to them. A provider, hospital, or other type of facility cannot ask you to limit or give up these rights. If you receive services from an out -of-network provider, hospital , or facility in any OTHER situation, you may still be balance- billed, or you may be responsible for the entire bill. If you intentionally receive non -emergency services from an out -of-network provider or facility, you may also be balance- billed. If you do receive a bill for amounts other than your co payments, deductibles , and/or coinsurance, please contact us at the number on your ID card, or the Division of Insurance at 303-894-7490 or 1-800-930-3745 (TTY 711) . Ambulance Information: You may be balance- billed for emergency ambulance services you receive if the ambulance service provider is a publicly funded fire agency, but state law against balance billing does apply to private companies that are not publicly funded fire agencies. Non -emergency ambulance services, such as ambulance transport betw een hospitals, are not subject to the state law against balance billing, so if you receive such services and they are not a service covered by Kaiser Permanente, you may receive a balance bill. 60577108_ACA_1557_MarCom_CO_2017_Taglines NONDISCRIMINATION NOTICE Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Colorado (Kaiser Health Plan) complies with applicable Federal civil rights laws and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, or sex.

Day and visit limits, Deductible s, and OPMs are based on a cal endar year Accumulation Period. I. DEDUCTIBLES There is no medical Deductible. If the plan purchased has a prescription drug benefit with a pharmacy Deductible, payments made for prescription drugs apply only to the pharmacy Deductible. The pharmacy Deductible represents the full amount you must pay for prescription drugs before any Copayment or Coinsurance applies. Prescription drugs may or may not be subject to the pharmacy Deductible. It depends on the plan purchased. Prescription Drugs required to be covered as \"Preventive Drugs\" will be covered with no Deductibles, Copayments, or Coinsurance A.

Copayments and Coinsurance\", \"Prescription Drugs, Supplies, and Supplements.\" II. ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUMS The OPM limits the total amount you must pay during the Accumulation Period for certain covered Services. Covered Services may or may not apply to the OPM (see \"III.

Referrals and Authorizations If your Plan Provider decides that you need covered Services not available from us, they will request a referral for you to see an Out-of-Plan Provider . If your Plan Provider decides you need specialty care that is not eligible for a self -referral, they will request a referral for you to see a specialty -care Plan Provider. (See the \"Specialty Referrals\" section below.) These referral request s result in an Authorization or a denial. However, there may be circumstances where Health Plan will partially authorize your provider's referral request . An Authorization is a referral request that has received approval from Health Plan. An Authorization is limited to a specific Service, treatment or series of treatments, and period of time. The provider or facility to whom you are referred will receiv e a notice of the Authorization, and you will receive a written notice of the Authorization. This notice will tell you t he provider's information. It will also tell you the Services authorized and the time period that the Authorization is valid. An Authorization is required for Services provided by Out-of-Plan Providers or Out-of-Plan Facilities. If your provider refers you to a n Out-of-Plan Provider or Out -of-Plan Facility, inside or outside our Service Area, you must have a written Authorization in order for us to cover the Services. All referral Services must be requested and authorized in advance. We will not pay for any care rendered by a provider unless the care is specifically authorized in advance by Health Plan. A written or verbal recommendation by a provider that you get non-covered Services (whether Medically Necessary or not) is not considered an Authorization and is not covered. 2. Specialty Referrals Generally, you will need a referral and prior Authorization for Services (including routine visits) from specialty -care Plan Providers. You do not need a referral or prior Authorization in order to obtain access to eye care services from a Plan Provider. You do not need a referral or prior Authorization in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a Plan Provider who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. For additional information on which Services require prior Authorization, please call Member Services . You will find specialty -care Plan P roviders in the Kaiser Permanente Provider Directory. The Provider Director y is available on our w ebsite, kp.org /locations . If you need a printed copy of the Provider Directory, please call Member Services . Authorization from Health Plan is required for: (i) Services in addition to those provided as part of the routine office visit, such as procedures or surgery; and (ii) visits to specialty -care Plan Providers not eligible for self -referrals; and (iii) Out -of-Plan Providers. The request for these Services can be generated by either your PCP or by a specialty -care provider. If the request is approved, the provider or facility to whom you are referred will receive a notice of the Authorization, and you will receive a written notice of the A uthorization. This notice will tell you the provider's information. It will also tell you the Services authorized and the time period that the Authorization is valid. A Plan Provider can directly refer you for some laboratory or radiology Services and for specialty procedures such as a CT scan or MRI. However, certain laboratory or radiology Services and specialty procedures will still require an Authorization. 3. Second Opinions Upon request and subject to payment of any applicable Copayments and/or Coinsurance, you may get a second opinion from a Plan Provider about any proposed covered Services. If the recommendations of the first and second provider s differ regarding the need for Services , a third opinion may be covered if authorized by Health Plan.

Authorization of a second or third opinion is limited to a consultation only and does not include any additional Services.

External Review Following receipt of an adverse benefit determination letter , you may have a right to request an external review. You have the right to request an independent external review of our decision if our decision involves an adverse benefit dete rmination regarding a denial of a claim, in whole or in part, that (1) is a denial of a preauthorization for a Service; (2) is a denial of a request for Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Colorado KPIF_IX_AI_HMO_COSP_EOC(01- 23) 38 Services on the ground that the Service is not Medically Necessary, appropriate, effective or efficient or is not provided in or at the appropriate health care setting or level of care; (3) is a denial of a request for Services on the ground that the Service is experimental or investigational ; (4) concludes that parity exists in the non -quantitative treatment limitations applied to behavioral health care (mental health and/or substance abuse) benefits; or, (5) involves consideration of whether we are complying with federal law requirements regarding balance (surprise) billing and/or cost sharing protections pursuant to the No Surprises Act (Public Health Service Act sections 2799A- 1 and 2799A -2 and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7149.110 --149.130) . If our final adverse decision does not involve adverse benefit determination as described in the preceding sentence, then your claim is not eligible for external review provided, however, independent external review is available when we deny your appeal because you request medical care that is excluded under your Kaiser Permanente plan and you present evidence from a licensed Colorado professional that there is a reasonable medical basis that the exclusion does not apply. You will not be responsible for the cost of the external review . There is no minimum dollar amount for a claim to be eligible for an external review. To request external review, you must: 1. Submit a completed Independent External Review of Carrier's Final Adverse Determination form which will be i ncluded with the mandatory internal appeal decision letter and explanation of your appeal rights (you may call the Appeals Program to request a copy of this form) to the Appeals Program within four (4) months of the date of receipt of the mandatory interna l appeal decision .

If we do not receive your external review request form and/or authorization form to release your health information, then we will not be able to act on your request. We must receive all of this information prior to the end of the applicable timeframe (4 months) for your request of external review. Expedited External Review You may request an expedited review if (1) you have a medical condition for which the timeframe for completion of a standard review would seriously jeopardize your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function, or, if you have a physical or mental disability, would create an imminent and substantial limitation to your existing ability to live independently, or (2) in the opinion of a p hysician with knowledge of your medical condition, the timeframe for completion of a standard review would subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the medical services that you are seeking . You may request expedited external review simultaneously with your expedited internal appeal as permitted under this Membership Agreement. A request for an expedited external review must be accompanied by a written statement from your physician that your condition meets the expedited criteria. You must include the physician's certification that you meet expedited external review criteria when you submit your request for external review along with the other required information (described above) . Additional Requirements for External Review reg arding Experimental or Investigational Services You may request external review or expedited external review involving an adverse benefit determination based upon the Service being experimental or investigational . Your request for external review or expedited external review must include a written statement from your physician that either (a) standard health care services or treatments have not been effective in improving your condition or are not medically appropriate for you, or (b) there is no available standard health care service or treatment covered under this Membership Agreement that is more beneficial than the recommended or requested health care service (the physician must certify that scientifically valid studies using accepted protocols demonstra te that the requested health care service or treatment is more likely to be more beneficial to you than an available standard health care services or treatments), and the physician is a licensed, board -certified, or board -eligible physician to practice in the area of medicine to treat your condition. If you are requesting expedited external review, then your physician must also certify that the request ed health care service or treatment would be less effective if not promptly initiated . These certifications must be submitted with your request for external review. No expedited external review is available when you have already received the medical care that is the subject of your request for external review . If you do not qualify for expedited external review , we will treat your request as a request for standard external review. After we receive your request for external review, we shall notify you of the information regarding the independent external review entity that the Division of Insurance has selected to conduct the external review. If we deny your request for standard or expedited external review, including any assertion that we have not complied with the applicable requirements related to our internal claims and appeals procedure, then we may notify you in writing and include the specific reasons for the denial . Our notice will include information about your right to appeal the denial to the Division of Insurance . At the same time that we send this denial notice to you, we will send a copy of it to the Division of Insurance. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Colorado KPIF_IX_AI_HMO_COSP_EOC(01- 23) 39 You will not be able to present your appeal in person to the independent external review organization . You may, however, send any additional information that is significantly different from information provided or considere d during the internal claims and appeal procedure .

Within 45 days of the independent external review entity's receipt of your request for standard external review, it shall provide written notice of its decision to you . If the independent external review entity is deciding your expedited external review request, then the independent external review entity shall make its decision as expeditiously as possible and no more than 72 hours after its receipt of your request for external review and within 48 hours of notifying you orally of its decision provide written confirmation of its decision. This notice shall explain the external review entity's decision an d that the external review decision is the final appeal available under state insurance law. An externa l review decision is binding on Health Plan and you except to the extent Health Plan and you have other remedies available under federal or state law . You or your designated representative may not file a subsequent request for external review involving the same Health Plan adverse determination for which you have already received an external review decision. If the independent external review organization overturns our denial of payment for care you have already received, we will issue payment within five (5) working days . If the independent review organization overturns our decision not to authorize pre - service or concurrent care claims, Kaiser Permanente will authorize care within one (1) working day . Such covered services shall be provided subject to the terms and conditions applicable to benefits under your plan. Except when external review is permitted to occur simultaneously with your urgent pre -service appeal or urgent concurrent care appeal, you must exhaust our internal claims and appeals procedu re for your claim before you may request external review unless we have failed to substantially comply with federal and/or state law requirements regarding our claims and appeals procedures.
