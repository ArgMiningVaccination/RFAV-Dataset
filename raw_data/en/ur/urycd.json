Platts-Mills, MD, PhD, Rung-chi Li, DO, PhD, Behnam Keshavarz, PhD, Anna R. Smith, MD, and Jeffrey M. Wilson, MD, PhD Charlottesville, Va The galactose- a-1,3-galactose ( a-Gal) syndrome has many novel features that are relevant to diagnosis and management. In most cases, the diagnosis can be made on a history of delayed allergic reactions to mammalian meat and the blood test for IgE to theoligosaccharide a-Gal. In general, the diagnosis also dictates the primary treatment, that is, avoiding mammalian meat and also dairy in some cases. In the United States, the lone star tick is the primary cause of this disease, but different ticks are responsiblein other countries. Blood levels of IgE to a-Gal often drop in patients who avoid recurrent tick bites, but the rate of decline is variable. Similarly, the delay before reactions is variable and theseverity of the allergic reactions is not predicted by the delay or the titer of speci c IgE. Some mammalian-derived products such as heart valves, gelatin-based plasma expanders, and pancreaticenzymes are relevant to only select patient groups. A minority of cases may bene t from avoiding a wide range of products that are prepared with mammalian-derived constituents, such asgelatin. This review focuses on the nature of the syndrome,common challenges in diagnosis and management, and also gaps in our current knowledge that would bene t from additional investigation. /C2112019 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology meat allergy INTRODUCTION In 2006 the mAb cetuximab was approved for the treatment of cancer of both head and neck and the colon.1It soon became clear that allergic reactions were occurring in major clinics in thesoutheast of the United States. 2Signicantly, Dr Tina Merritt obtained serum from 2 severe cases that occurred in Fayetteville,Arkansas, and in addition we had developed the technique of measuring speci c IgE (sIgE) using biotinylated proteins on a streptavidin ImmunoCAP.3In collaboration with both Bristol- Myers Squibb and ImClone we received pretreatment serafrom 76 patients who had received cetuximab, of which 41 camefrom Bristol-Myers Squibb and 35 came from Dr Christine Chung and her colleagues 4in the medical oncology group at Vanderbilt. Those studies demonstrated that the patients whohad reactions had preexisting IgE speci c for cetuximab and that the target of those antibodies was the oligosaccharide galactose- a- 1, 3-galactose ( a-Gal) on the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) portion of the mAb.4,5 Before 2006 we had seen at least 5 patients in the clinic who reported adult onset of allergic reactions related to eating meat.Those subjects described surprisingly long delays between eating meat and the reactions, and prick test wheal diameters to beef and pork were very small, that is, 3 mm or less. Thus, like mostother allergists, we could not make sense of their histories.During 2007 we looked in our allergy clinic for patients who had IgE speci ct o a-Gal comparable to that found in cancer patients who had reactions to cetuximab. Those studies identi ed that it was the patients who reported delayed reactions to mammalian meat (often called red meat) who had IgE speci c for a-Gal. Furthermore, when we presented the early results to a meeting inKansas City, Missouri ,Dr Barrett D. Lewis came forward and said, \"I have similar cases in Spring eld, MO. \"He sent us sera on 12 cases, 11 of whom had IgE speci ct o a-Gal and were included in the original article describing the syndrome.6 During 2007 it became clear that cases of delayed anaphy- laxis to red meat were present in the same area as reactions to cetuximab. Internet search suggested that this area, that is,Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, southern Mis- souri ,and eastern Oklahoma, was similar to the maximum area of Rocky Mountain spotted fever reported by the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention. 7Accepting this association and the implication that this for m of sensitization might relate to tick bites we questioned dozens of patients about thenumber of tick bites they had received. Those results supported a strong association between bites from the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum , and the syndrome. 8In addition, a history of prolonged itching at the site of tick bites was asignicant predictor of sensitization. 8Finally, we followed rises in sIgE after tick bites in 3 cases, 2 of whom developed delayed urticarial reactions to red meat.8Strikingly, none of the pa- tients reported a severe febrile illness comparable to clinical Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which is actually rare in this area.7,9It is now clear that it is unusual for A americanum ticks to carry Rickettsia rickettsii , but in contrast most lone star ticks in this area carry the related R amblyommatis .9Thus, it appearsDivision of Allergy & Clinical Immunology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant no.

All rights illnesses with positive Rickettsial serology that are sometimes classi ed as Rocky Mountain spotted fever are likely to be caused by R amblyommatis, or other spotted fever group Rickettsia, which can cause positive Rickettsial serology but onlymild symptoms. 10,11The details that explain the connection between tick bites and a-Gal sensitization remain an open question, but it is increasingly clear that certain ticks can express a-Gal and that tick antigens can have potent IgE-inducing properties.12-15The known properties of a-Gal as a blood- groupelike antigen of nonprimate mammals t with the re- ported speci city of the allergic reactions to red meat from mammals that carry a-Gal.16 At the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology meeting in 2008 we presented the story about a-Gal and learned about earlier reports suggesting a connection between tick bites and the onset of allergy to meat. In 2006, Van Nunen et al17 reported meat allergy cases related to tick bites in Sydney, Australia, which she published in 2009. Dr Deutsch in Athens, Georgia, had reported 5 very similar cases to the Georgia Allergy Society in 1989.18The importance of these cases is that they clearly show that the syndrome had been in existence before webecame aware of it. Dr Marianne van Hage and her colleagues 19 had also identi ed that sera from some cat-allergic patients had IgE speci c for an oligosaccharide on cat IgA. That epitope was later shown to be a-Gal, and the group in Sweden has now established the relevance of bites from the tick Ixodes ricinus toa- Gal sensitization and red meat allergy in southern Sweden.20-22 THE CLINICAL SYNDROME AND DIAGNOSIS Today we have extensive experience with classical cases of the a-Gal syndrome ( Table I ,A). 1. They have onset in adult life after eating meat without problems for many years. 2. Reactions range from localized hives or angioedema to severe anaphylaxis, which requires emergency treatment and admission to hospital. 3. Reactions start 2 to 6 hours after subjects have eaten meat of mammalian origin, and the severity of reactions is not pre- dicted by the delay.23,24 4. They have positive sIgE for a-Gal. If the antibodies are greater than or equal to 2 IU/mL or more than 2% of the total IgE, this makes the diagnosis very likely. We often measure totalIgE because some cases are nonatopic and have low totalIgE. 24Recently, we saw a case with a convincing history whose total serum IgE was 6.0 IU/mL and sIgE to a-Gal was 0.8 IU/mL. Thus, although the sIgE was less than 1.0 IU/mL,it was nonetheless more than 10% of the total IgE. 5. The nal element of diagnosis depends on how they respond clinically to a diet avoiding red meat. 25From conversations with allergists working in areas with a large number of cases it appears that at least 80% of cases t the classical description, where both diagnosis and primary treatment are relativelystraightforward.However, it is important to realize that many cases do not present classically. For example, there are a signi cant number of pediatric cases and the published data suggest that the condition in children has similar features. 26In particular, the speci city and titer of sIgE, the delay between eating meat and reactions, the relationship to tick bites, and the response to diet are all similar.24,27,28Another exception to the rule relates to the delay in symptom onset. Most evidence is consistent with a delay of 2 to 6 hours; however, a recent study found that 16% of subjects with the syndrome reported subjective symptom onset in lessthan 2 hours. 24Moreover, faster reactions were reported in a recent cohort from South Africa,28and have been consistently observed with pork kidney, both in clinical practice and inchallenge tests. 29-31 In terms of diagnosis it became clear in early studies that prick tests with extracts of beef or pork were unreliable.6Sensitization can be investigated using intradermal skin tests to beef, pork, andmilk as well as chicken, turkey, and sh as negative controls. 6 However, few clinics carry out intradermal tests for food anti- gens and most allergists rely on a blood test for IgE to a-Gal. There are no strict criteria for what sIgE levels equate with the diagnosis, though the preponderance of our patients have IgE specic fora-Gal that is at least 1% of the total IgE. Diagnos- tically there are 2 groups that often cause confusion: rst, patients with an unclear history who are found to have IgE to a-Gal and second, patients who give a history of reacting to mammalian products but whose blood test result is negative forIgE to a-Gal. What is the range of symptoms that can occur in relation to the syndrome? In our practice the most important group of nonclassical symptoms is those that involve the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal elements are not uncommon as part of reactions that include hives. However, there are patients who have episodesof abdominal pain without any skin involvement. Those cases are a problem because the possibility of food allergy is not obvious, and they can be severe. Indeed, 2 of the most severe cases we areaware of manifested with signi cant gastrointestinal symptoms but little if any dermatologic involvement. Interestingly, there have been very few subjects who have reported itching in the mouth or swelling of the oral tissue. Other diagnoses that ariseless commonly are arthritis and chronic pruritus. 24Dis- tinguishing a-Gal from chronic hives can be challenging, and there are some cases where the 2 entities may overlap.32In any case where the history is atypical but the sIgE is positive, the question that should be asked is whether they improve with avoidance of red meat or full avoidance of mammalian products.It is important to remember that random cohorts of subjects inTennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina have found that 15% or more of the population has IgE to a-Gal.4,27,33Thus, there must be many subjects who do not experience allergic symptomsdespite having the sensitization. Seronegative subjects with allergic responses to 1 or more mammalian products Obviously there are plenty of children with traditional immediate allergy to mammalian foods, but these are primarily related to proteins also present in cow 's milk and have typical rapid onset.34The cases we are interested in here are those with onset later in childhood or as adults who do not always reactJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT JANUARY 202016 PLA TTS-MILLS ET AL Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at Stony Brook University from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on February 27, 2022.

The rst group that became clear was the pork-cat syndrome. Although pork-cat was long recognized in Europe ithad been ignored in the United States. 35,36Most of the early cases we saw had been referred as possible cases of a-Gal syn- drome37and in a recent investigation of 261 subjects reporting red meat allergy, nearly 2% had an IgE signature suggestive ofpork-cat (ie, positive sIgE to cat, swine [Sus s 1]). 24At present, there is no clear explanation for why they present as adults. We have notcarried out challenges on pork-cat syndrome, and it is our judgment that none of the 3 cases reported in Table I ,B, would have agreed to a challenge. However, there are occasional caseswhere a challenge may be necessary to resolve confusion. MANAGEMENT The natural history of the syndrome and relevanceof tick avoidance Following patients in the clinic, including questions about symptoms, diet, and further tick bites, some aspects of natural history are already clear. First, all patients should be informed that further tick bites can maintain or lead to increases in the titerof IgE to a-Gal.38,39In contrast, most subjects who successfully avoid tick bites will experience a decrease in their a-Gal sIgE.39 Although the rate of decline is variable and it is not clear what degree of decrease is required to successfully regain tolerance, we have followed many patients whose titers became negative (ie, <0.1 IU/mL) and who re-reintroduced meat in their diet on their own. Avoiding tick bites in rural or suburban areas isdifcult, but normal avoidance measures, that is, appropriate clothing and sprays, can be effective.40-42The strongest evidence for sensitization to a-Gal relates to ticks, but it is possible that other ecto-parasites such as \"chiggers \"could also be relevant.43A complex question is why some people who live and work in an area with ticks do not become sensitized. This question may have2 elements: rst, are all individuals equally \"attractive \"to ticks? Multiple anecdotal stories report that ticks favor some subjects. Second, there are patients who report tick bites that do not itch and they do not usually become sensitized. There is currently nosolid information about the characteristics that predict either the tendency to get tick bites or the likelihood of becoming sensi- tized after being bitten. It is clear, however, that many subjectswho are not traditionally atopic (ie, do not produce IgE to aer- oallergens) can nonetheless develop sensitization to a-Gal and acquire the syndrome after getting tick bites. Levels of a-Gal sIgE and also the clinical presentation are similar in nonatopic subjects and their atopic counterparts.24 A question that often arises is whether eating red meat is alone sufcient to induce an IgE response to a-Gal. Our own pub- lished data provide strong evidence that people living in an area without ticks, such as Northern Sweden or New York City, do not develop sensitization to a-Gal or the syndrome despite eating large quantities of beef or pork.8,33The same data also argue against a role for other mammalian exposures, such as cat ownership, in developing IgE to a-Gal. We are unaware of any data that have looked at whether eating red meat can in fluence the levels of a-Gal sIgE in subjects who have the syndrome. An additional point is that some subjects with the syndrome maytolerate red meat on some occasions with few or no symptomsTABLE I. Clinical cases that reflect examples of allergic reactions to mammalian antigens in adults A. Severe anaphylactic cases in patients with speci c IgE to a-Gal Case 1: Anaphylaxis to \"the other white meat \"Female employee of the medical center, age 79 y. Mild episodes were suspicious for the syndrome; however, she thought pork was a \"white meat. \"She ate pork for lunch, started itching 3 hours later, and soon thereafter collapsed in the lobby. She required resuscitation with intravenous fluids, Solu-MEDROL, and repeated adrenaline and was admitted overnight. Her a-Gal sIgE was 82.7 IU/mL and tryptase was 36.5 ng/mL. Case 2: Abdominal pain A 45-year-old woman had multiple episodes occurring many hours after eating: full GI workup including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal a cause. History of multiple tick bites including \"chiggers. \"Several episodes started with abdominal pain and diarrhea. She was found collapsed on the bathroom floor mentally confused and was admitted to hospital overnight. Her IgE to a-Gal was 69.7 IU/mL, and she had a good response to a diet including dairy avoidance. Case 3: Anaphylaxis with transient loss of sightA 63-year-old policeman living in rural Virginia experienced 3 tick bites and after that he had 3 mild episodes of hives. Three hours after eating \"London broil \"he developed itchy hives and \"had to sit down. \" Found to have blood pressure of 40/0 and reported to EMS \"I can't see. \"Required full resuscitation in the emergency department including adrenaline drip overnight. Sight returned after 3 h. His IgE to a-Gal was 23 IU/mL, tryptase was 95.5 ng/mL, and he had a full recovery on an avoidance diet. B. Allergic reactions to other mammalian products \"masquerading \"asa-Gal Case 4: Pork-cat syndrome A 19-y-old woman with chronic GI symptoms associated with eating meat. Known tick exposure and also allergic to cat. IgE to a-Gal was 0.13 IU/mL, total IgE of 1406 albumin 18.6 IU/mL. She responded to a diet avoiding pork. Case 5: Anaphylaxis to vaccine containing gelatinPatient with reactions to barbecue and other meat for several years who experienced a severe reaction within 20 min of shingles vaccination (Zostavax). She collapsed and required full resuscitation and hospitalization. Her IgE to a-Gal was negative, but her IgE to gelatin was 5 IU/mL. Additional assays prepared in our laboratory showed IgE to bovine gelatin of 26.8 IU/mL and pork gelatin of 62.9 IU/mL. Case 6: Recurrent allergic reaction to milk and red meatWoman aged 66 y with history of \"insect \"bite reported periodic facial itch and swelling at night. Initially regarded as mammalian meat allergy, with IgE to a-Gal level of 0.11 IU/mL. Her episodes continued despite avoiding meat, including more severe swelling of face and throat. Found to have IgE to cow 's milk 72.9 IU/mL and IgE to BSA (Bos d 6) of >100 IU/mL and responded to dairy-free diet.

This intraindividual vari- ability is often not explained by the amount of meat and may reflect differences in the quantity or form of a-Gal that is present in the meat or could re flect the importance of cofactors such as exercise, nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory medications, and alcohol in modifying the allergic response.44In regard to the natural history of subjects who are sensitized but asymptomatic,there are currently no population-based follow-up studies and we are not in a position to recommend management of these cases except to avoid tick bites. Avoidance of \"red\"meat The primary advice for newly diagnosed cases of the syndrome is to completely avoid meat of mammals ( Figure 1 ). In most areas of the United States, this means beef, pork, and lamb.6However, internal organs are equally or more able to induce reactions.44 This includes kidneys, liver, heart, and intestines (tripe), butthe evidence is strongest for pork kidneys. 29,31In Europe and most other countries, many other animals are eaten, including rabbit, horse, goat, and so forth.29In rural United States, it is worth mentioning that venison and bear meat and also manyother small animals that can become part of \"Brunswick stew \" are all mammals. The case for avoiding dairy products We do not include avoidance of dairy products as part of primary avoidance, because most of the patients do not react tomilk or cheese ( Figure 1 ). This is not because glycoproteins or glycolipids carrying a-Gal are absent from dairy products. Indeed it has been clear since 2009 that these patients have IgE anti-bodies that recognize a-Gal in cow 's milk extract, and give positive skin reactions to milk.6Until recently the primary reason for recommending full avoidance of dairy products has beeninadequate control of symptoms in subjects avoiding red meat.Many of those patients have subsequently responded to a diet that also includes dairy avoidance. Avoiding products such as milk, yogurt, and ice cream is relatively easy because there arealternatives made from almond, oat, cashew, or other non- mammalian sources. The thing that patients miss most is English or French cheeses. 45 The argument about a dairy-free diet changes completely if consumption of a-Galecontaining products can contribute to inflammation without giving rise to allergic symptoms. Before the recognition of IgE to a-Gal, the cardiovascular group in Cambridge reported that patients with triple vessel coronary artery disease had a distinct pattern of IgG and IgD speci c for a-Gal.46In 2018, we reported that there was signi cantly worse coronary artery disease in patients who had IgE to a-Gal.47That study needs con rmation, but it implies that the risk related to IgE to a-Gal is not restricted to subjects who have allergic reactions. If it is true that patients with IgE to a-Gal have an increased risk of atherosclerosis even if they do not have allergic symptoms there are 2 groups of subjects who may need to beadvised to go dairy free as well as avoid red meat: First, patientswhose symptoms are \"controlled \"by avoiding red meat and second, subjects who have IgE to a-Gal but have not recognized symptoms related to red meat. The evidence at present is notstrong enough to make this as a recommendation, but clearly it is an area that needs more research. Additional considerations for managing the syndrome There are \"hundreds \"of ways in which food and other products that are not obviously mammalian could nonethelesshave products from mammals added during preparation or manufacture. 48The evidence for the presence of a-Gal in these different food and medical products varies markedly, with someitems clearly expressing the oligosaccharide (eg, cetuximab) andCetuximab NSAIDs, exercise, of reac/g415ons in the - Gal syndrome Food Medica/g415ons/Biologic Therapies Beef, pork, and other meat, and also innards, of non-primate mammals Dairy, including milk and cheese Gela/g415n-containing foodsGela/g415n plasma expanders Bovine/porcine & others)Heparin GelcapsHigher Risk Lower Risk Co-factors that may increase the risk or severity of reac/g415onsAn/g415-venom (e.g. - CroFab) FIGURE 1. The risk and also severity of reactions in the a-Gal syndrome relate to the amount of the oligosaccharide that is present in food, drugs, or other therapeutics. The route of administration is relevant to the speed at which reactions occur; that is, intravenous administration is associated with rapid reactions, whereas oral ingestion has delayed onset. Cofactors such as NSAIDs, exercise, andalcohol can be additional risk modifiers. This schematic reflects clinical experience, as well as challenge studies and laboratory investigations.

Although inmany cases insuf cient to make informed judg- ments, we think it is worthwhile to attempt to create a frame- work for thinking about relative risk and by extension management of the syndrome ( Figure 1 andTable II ). a. Nonmeat, nondairy food products i.Pork gut casings for sausages: Many varieties of sausages use casings derived from pork gut. Hence, chicken and turkey sausages, which would otherwise be safe, can induce anaphylactic or other reactions. We have seen at least 5patients who reacted clinically after eating chicken or turkey sausage that had a casing made of pork gut. Today most sausages are labeled correctly but caution isnecessary. ii.Mammalian fat in foods: Lard (rendered pork fat) is an important element of cooking, not only in pastry. Fat may also be added to mashed potatoes to add flavor, and pork fat is often added to venison either to add flavor or to make venison burgers. Thus, hunters who can normally tolerate venison may react if it has had pork fat added.Suet (unrendered fat from sheep or cattle) is also used in cooking, for instance, as part of mince meat. iii.Gelatin: Gelatin is a glycoprotein that is normally derived from collagen in the skin or hooves of cows or other largemammals. This protein can carry a-Gal epitopes but the quantity of the oligosaccharide varies according to the methods of extraction. In regard to food, gelatin is a mainingredient of jelly babies, marshmallows, and jello. Wehave seen cases of severe reactions in people after eating marshmallows and a detailed report that included chal- lenge tests has con rmed reactions to jelly babies. 51 iv.Tuna and dolphins: We have heard reports of apparent reactions to canned tuna where the possible explanation is contamination of the tuna with dolphin, which ismammalian. This is a good example of a situation where it would be helpful to have an assay for a-Gal in foodstuff. b. Other medical uses of mammalian proteins or parts i.Monoclonal antibodies: Despite the fact that many mAbs that are in clinical use are generated in nonprimate mammalian cell systems, the evidence for a-Gal expres- sion on most monoclonals other than cetuximab isminimal. 5One exception is in fliximab, which has been shown to express low amounts of the glycan and has been linked to reactions in a small number of subjects with the a-Gal syndrome.65The reason why a-Gal glycosylation of the Fab occurs selectively on cetuximab as compared with other monoclonal is likely due to differences in thecell lines used in production. Cetuximab is produced in mouse SP2/0 cells, whereas most other monoclonals are generated in other cell lines, such as Chinese hamsterovary cells. The speci c amino acid sequence in the FabTABLE II.

Insufcient data: Although heparin, stearic acid, glycerin, and lactic acid are or can be derived from mammals, there is no evidence that these products intr insically have a-Gal epitopes. It is possible that a-Gal is present as a \"contaminant \"; however, there is little evidence that this would be suf cient to contribute to symptoms.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT VOLUME 8, NUMBER 1PLA TTS-MILLS AL 19 Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at Stony Brook University from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on February 27, 2022.

Gelatin is present in some vaccines, including Zosta- vax and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. Cases of reactions to these vaccines in patients with IgE to a- Gal have been reported.53,54However, reactions to vaccines have also occurred in patients who had IgE to gelatin, but not to a-Gal55(Table I ,B). 2. Gelatin is used as a plasma expander in some coun- tries, particularly Australia and the United Kingdom.49,66Gelafundin is one such plasma expander; in fact, it has been used by some groupswhen skin testing for a-Gal.67 3. Gelatin-based capsules are used for many medicines and may give rise to symptoms in a small proportion of patients. Certainly they can add confusion in caseswhere a mammal-free diet has not successfully controlled symptoms (see Table II ). iii.Enzyme replacement: The pancreatic enzymes that are used for replacement in some cases of cystic brosis or other causes of pancreatic failure are puri ed from the pancreas of large mammals. These proteins, and alsoother mammalian-derived enzymes, have been shown toexpress a-Gal and have functional activity in basophil activation tests.58 iv.Bovine or porcine heart valves: Soon after the description of a-Gal we heard reports of patients who experienced hives or even a mild episode of anaphylaxis after transplantation of mammalian heart valves.57We then became aware that Dr Ankersmit and colleagues68in Vienna, Austria, had reported that transplantation of mammalian valves could cause an increase in IgG to a-Gal. Recently, there have been reports that mammalian valves degenerate more rapidly in patients with IgE to a-Gal.56This is a problem that should be solved by using a-Gal knockout pigs as a source of heart valves.69,70 v.Antivenom: The presence of a-Gal epitopes in antivenom formulations, which are puri from polyclonal IgG of venom-immunized nonprimate mam-mals, was convincingly shown by Fischer et al. 59 Importantly, the antivenom elicited basophil activationin an in vitro experiment with cells derived from a subject with the a-Gal syndrome. There has been at least 1 case report of an acute reaction to Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab in an a-Galesensitized subject that was attributed to the a-Gal syndrome.60 vi.Heparin: It is not obvious that the polysaccharide hepa- rin, which itself does not appear to carry a-Gal, should be a problem in patients with the a-Gal syndrome. None- theless, there have been a small number of case reports that have raised the possibility and we are currently consulted on this question with some frequency.64,71 Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan derived from pig intes- tine, and it is possible that some batches could be contaminated with glycosylated molecules derived fromthe pig. Alternatively, it is possible that the IgE response to tick bites in some patients includes a wider range of specicities. 72The fact that cases have only rarely been reported in the University of North Carolina, theUniversity of Virginia, or Vanderbilt suggests thatIgE-related reactions to heparin are uncommon, but this topic warrants additional investigation. vii.Magnesium stearate, and so forth: There have been rare reports of subjects with a-Gal syndrome who experienced reactions that were attributed to oral medications, even those that did not contain gelatin. Magnesium stearate, which can be sourced from mammalian fat (ie, stearicacid), was described as a likely culprit in one such case. 61 Given that magnesium stearate is not structurally similarto a-Gal, the implication was that residual a-Gal could be present as a contaminant in some preparations. Alternative medical approaches We are aware that there are some alternative/complementary medical approaches being offered in the community for thetreatment of the a-Gal syndrome, for example, auricular acupuncture and kinesiology. An interesting possibility is that the apparent ef cacy observed in some of these cases actually reflects the natural history of the syndrome; that is, a-Gal sIgE levels can drop rapidly in some cases. AREAS OF ONGOING RESEARCH Why do ticks give rise to the IgE response to a-Gal? Before the evidence focused on ticks, many other possible causes of this form of sensitization were considered including local plants or fungi and even nematode worms. However, the experience in Virginia suggested that sensitization was primarily,if not exclusively, caused by bites of the lone star tick. Althoughthe lone star is restricted to North America, sensitization to a-Gal in other countries has also been associated with the bites of different species of ticks (see Table E1 in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org ). Certainly, A americanum, Ixodes ricinus , and I holocyclus are each the most common cause of bites in the United States, Sweden, and Australia respec-tively. 8,22,73Several groups have now carried out investigations on ticks.12,13,21,74None of those studies suggest that the pro- duction of a-Gal is a special property of the lone star tick. At present it seems likely that several species of ticks express a-Gal and have salivary constituents that can promote T H2-related immunity. In keeping with the general tick theory there issome evidence that other ticks in the United States can causesensitization. In an area of northern Wisconsin and northern Minnesota where A americanum is not established, typical cases of the syndrome have been anecdotally related to bites of \"wood ticks, \"that is, Dermacentor variabillis. Mouse and other animal models of the IgE response to tick bites There is good evidence that either bites of live ticks or intradermal injections of tick extract will induce an increase inserum IgE in mice. 15,74However, \"wild-type \"mice express a-Gal on proteins and lipids and do not make IgE to a-Gal. To solve this problem, strains of mice with the gene for a- 1,3-galactosyltransferase knocked out ( a-Gal knock-out mice) are used to study IgE production.15,74,75There are many ques- tions that remain to be answered about IgE responses to oligo- saccharides in humans; however, there is already signi cant data about the role of T cells in mice. A recent article clearly dem- onstrates the relevance of T cells for the IgE response to tick extracts.15Interestingly, in earlier studies on the basis of pro- duction of IgG and IgM speci c fora-Gal by ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT JANUARY 202020 PLA TTS-MILLS ET AL Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at Stony Brook University from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on February 27, 2022.

All rights reserved.evidence strongly implicated natural killer T cells as the source of T-cell help.76The importance of this is that natural killer T cells can be activated by glycolipids. What is the mechanism of the delay before onset of symptoms and can this mechanism also be relevantto understanding chronic inflammatory effects of a-Gal exposure? The delay between eating red meat and the onset of symptoms has 2 elements: rst, the patients deny any early symptoms (either oral or systemic), and second, that despite delays of 2 to 6hours, symptoms can come on rapidly and episodes can be severe(Table I ). Because in vitro activation of basophils will occur within 20 minutes of exposure to a-Gal and intradermal skin tests to cetuximab or beef develop within 15 minutes, it seemslikely that the delay in symptoms re flects delayed arrival of the relevant form of antigen to mast cells that reside in peripheral tissues. Two things lead us to think about lipids; rst, many hunters said that venison was less of a problem than meat from domestic mammals. Venison meat comes from true wild animals and has very little fat. Indeed, making \"venison burgers \"requires addition of fat to make it stick together. Second, patients reported reacting after eating fat or pastry made with lard. The importance of this \"glycolipid hypothesis \"comes because it links together the relevance of fat, the delay in symptoms, and thepossible relevance to in flammation in arteries. 47,77,78In normal digestion, fat is assembled into chylomicrons, which enter the circulation after 2 hours. Over the next few hours, the fat isconverted into low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipo- protein, which involves a change in particle size from 300 nm down to 20 or 10 nm. The important fact for the argument isthat low-density lipoprotein or high-density lipoprotein can pass through the endothelial wall without in flammation. The hypothesis has to be that these particles derived from mammalianmeat or fat can activate mast cells either in the skin or in arterial walls. 78,79This idea is supported by the recent report of Roman- Carrasco et al80who demonstrated that a-Gal carrying glyco- lipids from beef, but not glycoproteins from beef, could transitthrough a Caco-2 epithelial barrier model and be packaged into chylomicrons. CONCLUSIONS In the 10 years since the rst description of delayed allergic reactions to mammalian meat, the a-Gal syndrome has become well recognized in many continents including Australia, Europe/ Asia, and North America. The features that distinguish thissyndrome from other forms of food allergy include (1) onset as an adult or late in childhood, (2) a relationship to previous tick bite(s), (3) the fact that the epitope for the IgE response is anoligosaccharide, and (4) the characteristic delay between eatingmammalian meat and onset of the symptoms. Many issues have arisen about the range of symptoms that develop in patients who are sensitized to a-Gal, but in most cases ( w80%) management by avoidance of red meat (and organs) is suf cient. A minority of cases (w5%-20%) also need to avoid dairy and gelatin. A small minority of cases ( w/C201%) needs to be aware of the large number of products that are derived from mammals. However, many sensitized subjects can continue to eat red meat or dairy without overt allergic symptoms. A big question that requiresfurther research is whether all patients with the syndrome shouldavoid dairy because of the possible link with chronic in flam- mation of the arteries. We also need to better understand the risk of reactions to the wide variety of products that may include small amounts of material derived from mammals.
