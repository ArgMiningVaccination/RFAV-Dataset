UALBANY MAGAZINE 2Dear Friend: A number of years ago, I was invited - challenged, really - to become involved with the University at Albany. Although I'm a proud graduate, I hadn't given much thought to volunteering my time and talent with the University until then-President H. Patrick Swygert called one day and asked me why I wasn't involved. Frankly, I couldn't think of a good answer! I came to the University as a freshman in 1965 and met my wife, Sandra, also an undergraduate at the time, the following year. We've been married 38 years; two of our sons are UAlbany gradu - ates. (The third went to SUNY Geneseo.) As you can see, I strongly believe in public education, and I have a real passion for the University at Albany. That's why I said \"yes\" to volunteering for the University in the early 1990s. I was appointed to chair the University Council and also served as an ex-officio director of The University at Albany Foundation. In those posts, and as a director of the State University Research Foundation, I've had the satisfaction of witnessing, first - hand, the growth of UAlbany's academic, research and athletic programs - and a concurrent surge of pride in our great University. Now, as interim president of the University at Albany, I extend two invitations to you. First, I invite you to read this issue of UAlbany , which focuses on alumni who enrich our lives through entertain - ment. In addition to learning about your former classmates' accomplishments and ambitions, you'll discover how their experiences at the University contributed to their career success and personal satisfaction - and prepared them to become better citizens of the world. Second, I invite you to lend your considerable talents to UAlbany. Like our fellow graduates highlighted in these pages, you have skills and initiative, and innovative ideas for using both. Participation in the Alumni Association is just one of the many ways you can bene - fit the University. (To learn about volunteer opportunities, please visit the association's Web site at http://www.albany.edu/alumni .) With more than 138,000 UAlbany graduates throughout the world, the possibilities for service to the University are endless! I hope you'll accept both of my invitations. Reading UAlbany will strengthen your pride in our University. And serving UAlbany will reinforce your conviction that the University is well worth the investment of your time and talent. Sincerely yours, George M. Philip, Esq., B.A.'69, M.A.'73 Interim President University at Albany Gary Gold '70 Upfront Two Invitatio ns George M. Philip earned a bachelor's degree in history and a master's in social studies at UAlbany, and a J.D. from Western New England School of Law. In 1971, he joined the staff of the New York State Teachers' Retirement System, which, with 400,000 members and $105 billion in assets, is one of the 10 largest public retirement funds in the United States. Philip held a number of high-level positions with the system, including those of executive director and chief investment officer, until his recent retirement. His appointment to head the University temporarily was announced in October 2007 by SUNY Interim Chancellor John B. Clark. WINTER 2008 3From the Podium And Beyond By Carol Olechowski Photos by Mark Schmidt Susan D. Phillips Is Interim Provost School of Education Dean Susan D. Phillips was named interim provost of the University at Albany in January. The appointment was announced by Interim President George M. Philip. Phillips, who has a background in human biology and psychology, has served as professor, program director and department chair since joining the UAlbany faculty in 1979. A recipient of both the University at Albany and Chancellor's awards for Excellence in Teaching, she has headed the School of Education for six years. UAlbany Celebrates Winter Commencement Thousands gathered at SEFCU Arena Dec. 9 to celebrate with the students honored at Winter Commencement 2007. A total of 550 bachelor's and 457 graduate degrees were awarded at the ceremony, which featured a keynote address by Albany Mayor Gerald D. Jennings, M.S.'76. Jennings himself received the Medallion of the University as a tribute to his years of public service and support for education. The undergraduate commencement class included students from eight states and 26 foreign nations, as well as seven military veter - ans and 12 Presidential Scholars. The youngest member of the class was 20; the eldest, 58. McNutt, Howell Receive Fulbrights Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics Louise-Anne McNutt and Professor of Philosophy Robert C. Howell are among 800 recipients nationwide of Fulbright Grants for 2007-08. McNutt left in February for a five-month stay at Tbilisi State Medical University in Tbilisi, Georgia. There, she is lecturing on blood-borne pathogen transmission prevention and offering insight into the development of the School of Public Health. Howell, an expert on the history of modern philosophy, analytical metaphysics and aesthetics, is teaching about Kantian objects and the metaphysics of art at Moscow State University in Russia. He will return to the United States in July. The Fulbright Scholar program, which provides resources to faculty wishing to teach and conduct research abroad, seeks to promote mutual understanding between the people of the U.S. and other countries. Three Education Programs Rank Among Top 10 The School of Education's doctoral programs in reading, curriculum and instruction, and educational psychology rate among the top 10 in the United States, according to the firm Academic Analytics, which conducts data collection and reporting for higher education. The rankings were based on Academic Analytics' Faculty Scholarship Productivity Index, which evaluates more than 7,400 doctoral programs in 172 disciplines at 375 institutions. In addi - tion, the index ranks institutions in such broader categories as the humanities and biological sciences, and institutions as a whole. NHGRI Awards $2.2 Million Grant to Tenenbaum The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) has awarded Assistant Professor of Biomedical Sciences Scott Tenenbaum of the School of Public Health and the University's Gen*NY*Sis Center for Excellence in Cancer Genomics a three-year, $2.2 million grant to study the organization and function of human genes. As part of a consortium of researchers participating in ENCODE - NHGRI's ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements - Tenenbaum is conduct - ing in-depth research with colleagues from MIT, Harvard, Duke, Stanford and Yale on the human genome in an attempt to discover \"all of its parts and how they function together, so we can use this information to improve people's health. It can have a direct impact on the future of understanding cancer and other diseases, and has the potential to positively affect many people's lives,\" explained Tenenbaum, a pioneer in ribonomics, which uses RNA-binding proteins to pinpoint sets of genes identified in specific diseases. In late 2007, NHGRI, which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announced grants totaling more than $78 million over the next four years to expand the ENCODE project.

This stage of the three- year project will focus on writing instruction in 20 middle and high schools in five states. The study - a collaboration of the National Writing Project; the Education Trust; the College Board; and UAlbany's Center on English Learning & Achievement (CELA), which Langer and Applebee co-direct - focuses on grades 6 through 12. Naming Recognizes Capital Region Philanthropists Morris and Esther Massry are well known throughout the Capital Region for their support of such philanthropic interests as the University at Albany's cancer research efforts. Last October, to thank the Loudonville, N.Y., couple for their generosity, the University bestowed the Massry name on the conference facility at its Gen*NY*Sis Center for Excellence in Cancer Genomics. Seminars, colloquia, and larger classes taught by the faculty of both the Cancer Research Center and the School of Public Health are hosted at the Massry Conference Center. Morris Massry, vice president of The University at Albany Foundation, is also a Foundation director. He was instrumental in helping the University to acquire the former Sterling Winthrop property in East Greenbush, N.Y., where the University's School of Public Health and the Cancer Research Center are located. The Massrys have donated $500,000 to further cancer research at UAlbany. Mara, Tisch Are Honored UAlbany recognized Wellington T. Mara and Preston Robert Tisch for their contribu - tions to the University by naming the football practice field used by their team each summer since 1996 in honor of the late co-owners of the New York Giants. Mara and Tisch, both of whom passed away in 2005, established the Giants' summer camp on UAlbany's uptown campus nearly a dozen years ago. In addition to supporting the monthlong camp, the men were instrumental in creating the New York Giants Scholarship, which has benefited 11 Capital Region students to date. \"60 Minutes\" Correspondent Attains 15 More Minutes of Fame Peabody and Emmy award-winning newsman Steve Kroft, a correspondent for CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" received the Medallion of the University at a Sept. 17 ceremony that also honored the first year of UAlbany's journalism program. The time he spent at at the University, Kroft noted, \"provided me an opportunity to spend some time with college students, which is always invigorating.\" His visit to Andy Rooney's hometown also jibe at Kroft's \"60 Minutes\" colleague: \"I'm relieved to report that the current residents aren't nearly as grumpy as he is.\" Belfort and Schell Are AAAS Fellows Professors Marlene Belfort and Lawrence Schell have been named Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Belfort, who joined the University's Department of Biomedical Sciences more than two decades ago, also directs the Division of Genetic Disorders at the New York State Department of Health's Wadsworth Center. Schell, director of the Center for the Elimination of Minority Health Disparities, is well known for his studies of pollutants and their effects on the physical and mental growth of children, especially youngsters from disadvantaged groups.

Since joining the team in 2005, the Senegal native has built a loyal following. And he credits the University at Albany, which made it possible for him to \"get a degree and play soccer,\" with helping to him to launch his career as a professional soccer player. \"Back home in Senegal, everything is soccer,\" remembered Coundoul, who came to the United States at age 14 and lived with his three older brothers in The Bronx. \"Everybody played, so automatically, you play.\" When it was time for college, \"UAlbany was my first choice.\" He majored in infor - mation science, minored in French and devoted plenty of time to the soccer team. \"You need time to play. You have to put every - thing into it, and really focus,\" Coundoul observed. At the University, he \"took a giant step to get closer to my goal. The coaching staff and my teammates gave me a little bit of a taste of the pro environment. I learned a lot from [head coach] Johan [Aarnio] and [assis - tant coach] R.J. I was lucky to be part of the team,\" said Coundoul, who was ranked one of the top college players during his years at UAlbany. Toward the end of Coundoul's senior year, \"Coach made some phone calls\" to pro soccer teams. Later, \"I got a call from the Colorado Rapids. I joined the team for one week and trained with the play - ers, and was offered a four-year deal.\" Coundoul is testimony to the power of positive thinking: He has wanted to be a professional soccer player \"since I was six years old. I was always telling people I would be a pro someday.\" Positive thinking also played a role in the creation of Coundoul's rallying cry, \"It's Bouna Time!\" He explained, \"We were doing some shooting drills, and I said, 'Say, guys, it's Bouna Time today!\" The phrase caught on. Spectators now chant his name, and, when asked, \"What time is it?\" they roar, \"It's Bouna Time!\" Coundoul is using his personal motto to assist kids in his hometown, Dakar. In conjunction with the Rapids Foundation, the team's charitable organization, he designed jerseys imprinted \"Bouna Time.\" Coundoul also autographs the shirts, which are sold at Rapids games. \"The fans are really supportive,\" reported the 25-year-old soccer star, who sends the proceeds back home to benefit children there. Soccer, Coundoul pointed out, \"is a year- round sport. We start out in February, and the season goes all the way to November. We are on the road a lot.\" Lately, he has been traveling even more than usual. Last fall, Coundoul was invit - ed to Paris to play with the Senegalese National Team, which competed Nov. 17 and 21 against the teams from Mali and Morocco, respectively. Senegal won the earlier match with a score of 3-2 but lost the second, 3-0. In 2007, Coundoul became the only team member ever to receive two player awards from the Rapids. He hopes that his suc - cess will encourage UAlbany to \"pay a lit - tle more attention\" to its soccer program. The University, he noted, \"has some tal- ented players, and soccer is the fastest- growing sport in the U.S. It is just like the rising sun; you cannot stop it.\" at Colorado Rapids games.\u00a9DigPicPhoto \u00a9DigPicPhoto WINTER 2008 7Decades ago, a famous Hollywood film studio boasted that it had \"more stars than there are in the heavens.\" We don't like to brag (too much), but a veritable constellation of University at Albany graduates works in the entertainment industry.

By Carol OlechowskiUALBANY MAGAZINE 8Frank Whaley, B.A.'85 \"Ironweed\" and Irony At the University at Albany, Frank Whaley discovered a \"great\" theatre program, \"amazing\" facilities, a city with a \"different\" cultural scene - and his range as an actor. \"Professor Jim Leonard, one of my acting teachers, was a great influence. He helped me to find my range,\" recalls the Syracuse, N.Y.-born Whaley, admitting, \"I've played a lot of bad guys.\" He attended SUNY Potsdam as a freshman but, in 1982, transferred to Albany, where his brother, Robert Whaley, B.A.'84 (now an actor and musician), was enrolled as a theatre major. An EOP student, Frank Whaley majored in theatre and \"began writing monologues to perform in class.\" He took two courses with Professor of English William Kennedy, who would also have a profound - and some - what ironic - influence on his career. In the late 1980s, Whaley was working as a waiter in New York City Suzanne Tenner/Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.when he learned of a casting call for the film \"Ironweed,\" based on Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. \"I had read the book, and all of William Kennedy's books, and I made sure that I got into audi - tions. I was cast in the role of Francis Phelan, the main character, as a young man; Jack Nicholson played Francis at a later age. It was amazing.\" The movie, filmed in Albany, brought Whaley back to \"Lark Street below Central, where I had lived while attending the University. It was just crazy,\" adds the actor, who received his diploma two years after graduating from Albany because \"I couldn't afford to pay my library fines\" until 1987. \"Ironweed,\" Whaley's first film, set the pace for his career. (For a par - tial list of his movies, see the side - bar.) But Whaley, 44, is also a pop - ular character actor on TV; his recent guest appearances include roles on \"House\" and \"Boston Legal.\" At this point, though, the father of two (Buster, 5, and Tallulah, 3) observes: \"I prefer to write and to direct my own writ - ing. It's much more challenging and fulfilling to see the project transform from beginning to end.\" In 1999, for his first writing-direct - ing effort, \"Joe the King,\" Whaley won the Sundance Film Festival's Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. His latest project is intended for the small screen. Whaley and his wife, actress-writer Heather Bucha, are collaborating on a \"dark comedy\" about the fictional Sharon Shaw, \"an actress past her prime, and her struggle to maintain her sanity and raise her daugh - ter in Hollywood. Sharon was a big movie star, but she's forced to take a co-hosting job on a nature program. Heather and I will write and produce the series; we're negotiating with a couple of TV networks. We're talking to a few actresses, too; it's a meaty role.\" Whaley knows about meaty roles. Whether he's offered a dramatic or comedic part, \"I can do it all, and I'm really excited about both. I've never thought in terms of doing one or the other. If it's something I can sink my teeth into, it doesn't matter what category the role falls into. I'm proud of my range.\" WINTER 2008 9 Film facts Opposite: Frank Whaley starred in the 2007 thriller \"Vacancy.\" Whaley poses with \"Pulp Fiction\" co-star Uma Thurman (above), joins wife Heather Bucha and children Buster and Tallulah for a family outing (right).

Born in Albany and raised in the city's Pine Hills neighborhood, Carmello majored in business administration at the University and was looking forward to a career in personnel work or marketing. \"I lived on Dutch Quad, and I tried out for a couple of shows there as a lark,\" recalled Carmello, who played the roles of Nancy (Oliver!) and Hodel (Fiddler on the Roof) in quad productions. At the time, though, acting \"was really just a hobby for me,\" she noted. In the summer of 1983, Carmello went to Lake George, where she performed in the musical They're Playing Our Song . For her, \"that was the beginning. I met a lot of actors from New York City. I had to join the Actors' Equity Association to do the show, and I was exposed to a part of the theatre I hadn't seen before. I had no expectations.\" The only thing Carmello did expect was that her aspirations would - n't work out, \"and I would be going back to my business roots. I thought attempting to have a career in the theatre would last a year, or maybe two. That was 24 years ago.\" Carmello modestly attributes much of her success to luck. When a show closed or she missed out on a role, \"I was lucky enough to get another theatre job.\" Her first big break on Broadway was City of Angels. Since then, she's gone on to star in numerous other produc - tions. For her role in Parade , Carmello was nominated for a Tony and earned a Drama Desk Award; Lestatwon her Drama Desk and Carolee Carmello, B.S.'83 From Bachelor of Science to Broadway Star From left, Judy McLane, Carolee Carmello and Gina Ferrall take center stage at the Cadillac Winter Garden Theatre. Joan Marcus WINTER 2008 11 Tony nominations. Her other Broadway credits include The Scarlet Pimpernel; Kiss Me, Kate ; Urinetown ; Falsettos; and 1776 . Off Broadway, Carmello has performed in such shows as Elegies; I Can Get It For You Wholesale ; and Hello Again , for which she received an Obie. Currently, Carmello is appearing at the Cadillac Winter Garden Theatre in Mamma Mia!the long-running musical that features a score packed with tunes by the popular 1970s rock group ABBA. The role of Donna Sheridan showcases both Carmello's vocal talent and her acting skills. When she's not onstage, the actress plays two other roles: wife and mother. She and her husband, Tony Award nominee Gregg Edelman, first met in City of Angels. Carmello had one line; \"I played a maid. The part was very small, and I didn't stay with the show.\" Years later, the couple appeared together in another production, and something clicked. Married for almost 13 years, they have two children, Zoe and Ethan. The family resides in New Jersey. If she weren't a world-famous theatre professional, Carmello could pic - ture herself in \"corporate administration somewhere.\" She's thought of returning to school for her M.B.A. and is glad to have earned a business degree at UAlbany. \"A lot of my friends feel the theatre is the only career path; they can't even entertain the idea of another possibility,\" she observed. \"With my degree, I could do other things. I have something to fall back on. It's also helped me in the business - dealing with contracts and negotiations and investing my money. There are a lot of entrepre - neurial aspects to show business; you have to market yourself, in a way. My degree has definitely paid off.\" Carmello (as Donna Sheridan) and her co-star Carey Anderson (as Donna's daughter, Sophie) share a touching moment onstage in Mamma Mia! D.B. Woodside, B.S.'91 He's not even 40, but he's already been a high-school principal, a physician and President of the United States - all on the small screen, that is! D.B. Woodside, B.A.'91, earned a degree in theatre from UAlbany, then went on to the Yale School of Drama for an M.F.A. In the years since, the Queens, N.Y., native has had recurring roles on \"The Division,\" \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and as \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"CSI\" and \"JAG.\" Woodside is probably best known for his role as the brother of President David Palmer - and then as President Wayne Palmer - on the TV drama \"24 .\" Joan Marcus Eric Deskin, B.A.'86 Taking Life Less Seriously If you need an attorney, don't call Eric Deskin. (He describes himself as a \"lapsed lawyer.\") But if you need someone who excels at ice and in-line skating; plays piano, French horn, guitar, tennis and golf; and professes to be \"fluent in Legalese,\" \"conversant in Spanish,\" com - puter literate and able to do bird calls, then Deskin is your man. He even claims to be capable of accomplishing several of these feats simultaneously. \"Yes, I can indeed do bird calls, while I skate and play the piano,\" affirms Deskin. \"The French horn is largely in the past, but I could fake it if I had to!\" Deskin is much better known for his comedic and acting skills than for his musical talent, however. He's made audiences in the United States, Canada, Britain and The Netherlands laugh at his observations about family, news, pop culture and life in general. In his native New York City, Deskin has performed in the theatre (Edward Albee's Everything in the Garden; The Duchess of Malfi). He's also worked on television (\"Rescue Me\"; \"One Life to Live\") and in many (\"You Are Alone\"; \"Killing Time,\" a 2002 Sundance\u00ae Official Selection). His latest foray into TV was a guest shot as an advertising executive in the pilot episode of ABC's \"Cashmere Mafia,\" which stars Lucy Liu. He has also appeared in many television commercials and print campaigns. Deskin came to acting and comedy in a roundabout way. He intended to major in biology at the University at Albany but \"got slammed by organic chemistry and calculus. So I began taking geography courses, notably Stanley Blount's freshman course in physical geography, which was incredible. Each class was a slide show of every place on the planet that Professor Blount had explored. Later, I took more and more courses focusing on urban and regional planning. One of them, with Christopher Smith and Sam Thyagarajan, was a gradu - ate-level class where we did a comprehensive plan for the City of Saratoga Springs.\" After receiving his bachelor's in geography, Deskin earned a J.D. from Hofstra University School of Law, then \"went right into a big white-shoe Wall Street firm that has since folded - through no fault of my own. My first year there, I did very little work and was compen - sated nicely. It was a fun time.\" However, Deskin soon grew \"disillusioned with the law game\" and eventually,To listeners, Kathryn Zox is \"Your Social Worker with a Microphone.TM \" But the nationally recognized radio host, who produces \"The Kathryn Zox Show\" from her Slingerlands, N.Y., home, could just as accurately be called \"The Teacher Who Loves to Talk\" or \"The Talker Who Loves to Teach.\" Zox honed her credentials through education, hard work and life experience. A graduate of Boston University with a B.A. in psychology and an M.Ed. in counseling psychology, she enrolled at the University at Albany (\"a great school\") after she and her family relocated from New Jersey to Oneonta, N.Y., in the early 1980s. Zox cites \"good pro - fessors,\" like the late Susan Sherman, and the \"excellent curriculum\" as having contributed to her positive experience at UAlbany. \"A friend and I commuted to the School of Social Welfare. I'd get all my classes done in two days. I had a field placement in the dialysis unit at Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, and another at the Delaware County Probation Department. It would have been a great reality television show,\" laughs Zox, adding, \"I was nine months' pregnant when I graduated.\" A week after giving birth, she went back to Albany - \"nursing new baby, with nanny in tow\" - to take the C.S.W. exam. Zox, 60 - \"the new 40,\" she points out - has combined her education and talents to create a multifaceted career. Highlights include training doctors and medical students to communicate effectively with their patients through Albany Medical College's Clinical Competency Program; developing and implementing a corporate training pro - gram, \"Managing AIDS in the Workplace,\" for Fortune 500 compa - nies; and acting in community theatre, television (\"The Sopranos,\" \"Law & Order\") and commercials (for Time Warner and Fox TV). Zox has also been featured in print ads for the I Love New York State Travel Guide and \"even admits\" to having modeled for AARP magazine. Several years ago, Zox's volunteer work opened a new avenue of opportunity. While reading for RISE, a 24-hour radio information service WMHT provides for the blind and the print disabled in the Capital Region and the Hudson Valley, \"I realized I loved being on the radio,\" and \"The Kathryn Zox Show\" was born. For the program, aired daily via Internet on the VoiceAmerica Women's Network and weekly on WMET 1160AM in Washington, D.C., Zox has interviewed \"thousands of guests.\" The focus on women's issues \"keeps women connected, informed and entertained, with memorable guests like Al Roker, Robin Cook and Miss America 2007,\" says Zox, who will receive the UAlbany Alumni Association's 2008 Excellence in Public Service Award this May. \"It takes a lot of time to produce the show,\" adds the mother of three grown sons. Zox selects the topics, books guests, markets the program and works the controls at her home studio herself. Her dedication has been rewarded: Recently, \"The Kathryn Zox Show\" was the most-lis - program on the VoiceAmerica Women's Network.

Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , has captivated readers. But, until Gregory Maguire decided to delve into the matter, no one had given much thought at all to the Wicked Witch of the West, the nemesis who plagues Dorothy and her companions as they seek out the wizard, who will (they hope) grant them some special favors, including the girl's wish for a safe return home.In Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, Maguire explores the background of the witch from birth to death. Although Wicked is often characterized as \"the back story of the Wizard of Oz ,\" the author himself describes the work as \"a novel in which I could examine the curious conundrums surrounding the notions of human malfeasance and the tendency to demonize those with whom we disagree. That it should be about a villain that read - ers would commonly understand to be evil was simply a given; the Wicked Witch of the West occurred to me as an inspiration. Everyone in the U.S. knew who she was, yet Baum, and the 1939 film based on his classic children's novel, had given virtually no background story for her. She was easily identifi - able, yet ripe for interpretation.\" Maguire \"knew Wicked was a good idea,\" but he felt the book, written for adults, would be only \"moderately successful; it might stop selling when enough people had read it to pronounce, 'Oh, it doesn't live up to its promise.' I did not expect that the word of mouth would be positive, would make it a sleeper.\" By the time the musical Wicked , based on Maguire's work, opened on Broadway in 2003, \"the novel had sold 700,000 copies. It has sold six times that number by today.\" Both versions of Wicked have garnered so much acclaim that most people are probably unaware that Maguire is also a highly successful author of books for children. He credits the University at Albany with nurturing his interest in that genre. Maguire enrolled at the University in 1972, attract - ed by its \"fine reputation,\" its proximity to his home and its affordable tuition. The Albany, N.Y., native was \"too busy\" working his way through school and completing his academic work in dual majors (English and studio art) to participate in extracurricular activities. However, he enjoyed his classes and recalls that, freshman year, he was \"par - ticularly taken with a six-credit course in [William] Faulkner, and also my first English course, Love, Sex and Power in the American Novel.\" Maguire also fondly remembers Assistant Professor Lillian Orsini, M.S.L.S. [now emerita], who taught library sciences and \"kindly allowed me into her graduate seminar in children's literature. With her as one of Gregory Maguire, B.A.'76 A Wicked Talent WINTER 2008 15 my mentors, I took an independent study in writing fiction for children.\" His first book, The Lightning Time , was published by Farrar Straus and Giroux in 1978. Over the next two decades, Maguire penned a number of other children's books, including Six Haunted Hairdosand Seven Spiders Spinning . \"I knew from per - sonal experience that writing for children can be among the most powerful of com - munication tools,\" he observes. \"Young readers are generous in their sympathies, open-minded and passionate. To write for children is to write for the most dedicated and responsive audience around.\" Yet, the switch to adult literature was not difficult. \"My solidest prep work for Wicked was the reading I had done as a child. I felt I could use all the love of the invented landscapes I had developed in reading [J.R.R.] Tolkien, [Ursula] LeGuin and others; I could range from low comedy to high tragedy, from mild social farce to social criticism. It was not hard to change gears; it was merely a matter of changing topics,\" Maguire says. For his latest book, Maguire returned to his roots as a children's author.

UALBANY MAGAZINE 16 When Brian McNamara answers the telephone, his voice is husky, as if he's been weeping. \"I have to cry today,\" he sobs. \"It's an emotional day.\" Then, unexpectedly, he bursts into a hearty laugh. He's just prepar - ing for a role in the CBS television series \"Criminal Minds,\" in which he portrays a man who's just learned a family member has been murdered. \"It's a very strange world I live in,\" adds McNamara, still laughing. \"I try to explain it to my six-year-old son, Tyler, but he doesn't get it. When I tell him I have to spend the day crying, he says, 'Fine, Dad; have a nice day.'\" It is a strange world for someone who started out at UAlbany as a business major to please his parents, who sold real estate. McNamara, now 47, also got a real estate license - \"which I never used.\" But the self-described \"class clown\" really longed for the footlights and decided to minor in theatre. Paradoxically, McNamara was also \"particularly shy\"; in fact, when he went to his first acting class at the University, \"I walked out because I was so scared.\" Still, \"I loved the theatre and the theatre department, and the Performing Arts Center, which had five or six beautiful theatres,\" the Long Island native recalls. \"I became a scenic design assistant and stayed that for three years.

Her initial career goal (at her mom's behest) was teacher. Her own true passion was - and is - comedy. She writes and performs her own stand-up routines, both on the road and on TV (\"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson,\" \"The Tonight Show\" and HBO's \"One Night Stand\"). Inspirations for her material include her husband, Tom Frykman, and daughter, Milan, 4, adopted from China in 2004. The proud mommy says Milan \"is a great kid. She's smart and has a lot of energy. When she's here, she's the show! She comes home after a full day [of pre-K], and she's just starting. It's as if she's saying, 'That was a good warm-up; now, let's do the real stuff!' Milan's a great mix of feminine and mas - culine: She loves wearing dresses, but she also likes power tools - just like my hus - band. He's not too proud to put on a dress, either!\" Ladman's work earned her a 1992 American Comedy Award for Best Female Stand-Up Comic; and appearances on the last two anniversary broadcasts of Johnny Carson's \"Tonight Show.\" In addition to performing stand-up , she writes scripts for television (most recently, \"Rules of Engagement\" - \"if the WGA strike ends soon!\"). Her other writing credits include \"The King of Queens\" and \"Roseanne\". Ladman has guest-starred on series as \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and \"Everybody Loves Raymond.\" She's also performed Wilson's War,\" Recently, appeared in: \"The JAP Show: The Princesses the pio - neering women of Jewish stand-up come - dy\"; and, in Palm Springs, Calif., a panel discussion of \"Making Trouble,\" a docu - mentary highlighting the comedy of Sophie Tucker, Molly Picon, Fanny Brice and other Jewish funny ladies. Currently, she's working on \"Does This Show Make Me Look Fat?\" soon in pre - views at Actor's Art Theatre in Los Angeles. The show was inspired by Ladman's battle with anorexia. \"I was about 19 when it really started to manifest itself in full force. After college, I went down to under 85 pounds, and I'm 5'5\". I was not a healthy person.\" Ladman got help from New York's Ackerman Institute and Overeaters Anonymous, \"a 12-step program not only for people who are obese, but for those with all sorts of eating disorders.\" She considers \"Does This Show Make Me Look Fat?\" \"a calling.\" \"A lot of these problems start when women are so young, and they really don't know where to go for help,\" notes Ladman, who hopes to bring the show to schools and to theatres.

I enjoyed the rehearsal process, but as soon as I walked out onstage the first night, I just knew this was what I wanted to do with my life.\" McNamara honed his craft with William (Bill) Leone, then a voice and acting teacher at UAlbany. \"He's a terrific actor, and he saw how driven and focused I was. Any oppor - tunity we got, we would go into a theatre and work. It was a great experience. He taught me to keep my acting very simple,\" McNamara remembers. After completing his studies, McNamara headed for California, where he still lives, and soon found work. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes roles on dozens of television programs, including His latest role is that of Col. Michael Holden on the Lifetime drama \"Army Wives,\" in which he co-stars with Kim Delaney (his screen wife), Catherine Bell, Wendy Davis and Sally Pressman. McNamara admits to being \"the biggest mushbowl there is; I cry at the drop of a hat!\" So playing the Holden character - a tough military officer accustomed to \"giving commands without yielding and letting his subordinates know he's the guy to follow\" - has \"its own challenges.\" For inspiration, he looked to his eldest brother, Christopher McNamara, a retired U.S. Navy captain \"who got things done. I've seen him in action!\" Coincidentally, \"Army Wives\" is taped at a former naval base in Charleston, S.C., where Christopher McNamara was once stationed. Brian McNamara had a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu the first day of taping when he realized that the house where he \"lives\" in the series was directly across the street from the home where his brother once resided. \"Army Wives\" taped 13 episodes for its first season; the show has been picked up for 19 episodes for 2007-08. In November, McNamara and the other cast members were awaiting the outcome of the writers' strike to resume taping. McNamara's mom, sadly, passed away while he was in college, but his 79-year-old dad is \"my biggest fan.\" And his kids? Tyler and his sister, Brenna, 16, are \"growing into being fans,\" McNamara says.David List,B.S.'83 From Driver to Driven UALBANY MAGAZINE 18 New York City native David List majored in marketing at the University at Albany. When he wasn't studying, he captained his intramural softball and hockey teams. List broke into show business in the New York offices of the William Morris Agency as the chauffeur for Lee Stevens, the agency's presi - dent. Bill Cosby, George Burns, Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Walters were among the first stars List drove around in Stevens' Jaguar. This opportunity to shuttle TV and movie stars around Manhattan gave List \" access to watch and listen to , in a very inti - mate and private setting, the interaction between some of the most powerful theatrical agents and stars in the entertainment industry.\" It didn't take long, however, for Stevens to realize that List's potential went beyond the steering wheel . After six months, List was promot - ed to serve as assistant to the president . Shortly thereafter, he joined William Morris' television packaging department , which packaged and sold such megahit series as \"The Cosby Show\" and \"Roseanne.\" In 1988, List moved to Los Angeles , where he continued to work as an agent for two years. But in 1990, he left the agency business and segued into film production when he became the head of produc -tion for Dodi Fayed's new company, Allied Stars , based at Tristar Pictures . After a two-year collaboration with Fayed, List was offered, and accepted, a similar post with legendary producer Albert S. Ruddy , whose many films include Academy Award-winners \"The Godfather\" and \"Million Dollar Baby.\" In the late 1990s, List founded his own company, RoadDog Industries, Inc. (The name was inspired by the nickname \"Road Dog,\" given him by a female colleague.) List is both a personal man - ager representing writers and directors , and a film producer set to produce the return of the \"Fletch\" comedy/mystery franchise for Harvey Weinstein . The films are based on the series of 11 Fletch novels by author - and List client - Gregory Mcdonald ; \"many worldwide fondly remember the original 'Fletch' film made in 1985, which starred Chevy Chase.\" List is also producing an independent film, \"Comeback,\" with Kris Kristofferson and Ashley Judd. List's marketing degree \"provided a great foundation\" for his career in the entertainment industry. \"You have to know not only market - ing, but also finance, economics and entertainment law, \" he observes. \"There's a reason it's called 'show business,' not 'show art.'\" Laura Bonington Masse, B.A.'86 Marketer Par Excellence As a student at the University at Albany, Laura Masse thought she would someday teach \"at the collegiate level.\" But today, as Hallmark Channel's executive vice president of Marketing, Masse is using the skills she acquired as an undergrad - uate to promote the general entertainment cable network and better serve its millions of viewers. The Chappaqua, N.Y., native \"had a wonderful high school experience, but the first day I visited Albany, I knew I wanted to go there. It was just about the polar opposite of my high school - large, diverse and very urban in tone.\" She majored in political science - \"political philosophy, to be exact\" - and had \"a strong minor\" in history, missing a double major \"by just a few credits.\" Masse, who graduated magna cum laude , fondly recalls Distinguished Teaching Professor of History Warren Roberts: \"I think I took every class he taught. It didn't matter to me what the subject was, because I found his very integrated approach to teaching so interesting. He looked at specific periods of time from the standpoint of music, art, political discourse and literature. So you really came away with a 360-degree view of the period and the interplay of themes and ideas that influenced events.\" Courses like Roberts', and others in political science, helped Masse hone \"the ability to tease out ideas, synthesize concepts and develop integrated conceptual frameworks.\" She has used those skills throughout her career, which included 10 years \"on the advertising-agency side of the business.\" She later worked for one of her clients, Discovery Channel, then for American Movie Classics. She joined Hallmark Channel six years ago. In her role as executive VP, Masse directs \"all marketing activity for the network, including brand stewardship, consumer market - ing, affiliate marketing and ad sales marketing. In addition, the Print Design team - responsible for all print, creative and advertis - ing - reports to me.\" Masse is proud of her affiliation with Hallmark, \"a 100-year-old brand that stands for quality, trust and connecting with people you care about.\" Its Hallmark Hall of Fame movies, a collection of which runs on the network, have been television staples for more than five decades. \"We are also the leader in produc - ing new original movies - great stories well written and well told, with universal themes relevant to our viewers,\" noted Masse, adding that Hallmark Channel will produce 30 such films - \"more than any other net - work\" - for 2008. \"We also air well-loved series like 'Little House on the Prairie.'\" Launched in 2001, Hallmark Channel has enjoyed \"tremendous growth\" in just six years, according to Masse, and consistently numbers among \"the top 10 cable networks in both primetime and total day ratings.\" She attributes its popularity to the \"real demand for family-friendly television, for a place where viewers can feel comfortable with a good story, and not challenged by violence or obscenity.\" Masse, who splits her time between Hallmark Channel's East and West coast offices, finds her work interesting and rewarding. Early on, though, there was one challenge: maintaining two households. \"When I first joined the network, I spent about 80 percent of my time in Los Angeles,\" Masse remembered. \"My husband, Paul, and I rented a furnished house there, and he would join me most weekends.\" Now, Masse usually spends only about a week a month in L.A., so she's given up the second house, along with all of its stresses. \"I'd frequently forget what groceries I'd need in which place and end up with, say, twice as much coffee in one location and none at the other.\" WINTER 2008 19 UALBANY MAGAZINE 20 Monte Lipman says he and his brother, Avery, have always had \"a tremendous interest in music,\" although neither sings or \"has ever played an instrument.\" But that hasn't kept Monte, Universal Republic Records' president and CEO, and Avery, co- president and chief operating officer, from becoming one of the most dynamic family acts in the music field. For the Lipmans, music has been \"a hobby and a passion,\" explains Monte, who was on the staff of WCDB and a member of the con - cert committee when he majored in communication and minored in business at Albany. Selling recorded music is nothing new to them: Both worked at the campus record co-op as undergraduates; in fact, Avery managed the shop for two years. Today, they're still selling music - but on a grander scale. Monte recalls \"transitioning into the business\" in the early 1990s. That was when he and Avery launched their own label, Republic Records, \"in the kitchen of our father's house\" in New Jersey. Back then, \"in the pre-computer days, any album packaging we created was cut and paste. But everything went well. We never intended to build Republic into a powerhouse; we just wanted to work with cool artists, people who put out music that we liked.\" The Lipmans scouted potential talent in clubs and from newspaper stories, or via tips from friends and relatives of fledgling acts, as well as from demo tapes submitted by performers. The first artist Republic signed, Bloodhound Gang, became \"a huge international smash.\" Hits by Chumbawamba and 3 Doors Down followed - as did a buyout several years ago from Universal Music Group, which is No. 1 in international sales of recorded music. The siblings' label, now known as Universal Republic Records, retained them in upper management. Both brothers \"spend a fair amount of time trying to find artists we feel we can be successful with,\" notes Avery. \"We oversee marketing and promotion and development of artists, helping them to be suc - cessful. In terms of technology, we find ourselves in the midst of a fundamental transformation. On the one hand, it's frustrating and scary; on the other, it's probably the most incredibly challenging and exciting time to be in business.\" Technology has indeed transformed the music business, Monte confirms. \"With the popularity of the Internet, there's more access and communication than ever. Back in the day, a kid didn't know where to send the [demo] tape. Now, we can correspond directly Monte Lipman, B.A.'86 Avery Lipman, B.A.'88 A Passion for Music Music-loving brothers Avery (left) and Monte Lipman head Universal Republic Records.Courtesy Universal Republic Records WINTER 2008 21 with artists in a matter of moments. Most of the music we receive now is digital. A good number of people still mail it to us, but folks also send things to their MySpace pages.\" Universal Republic \"is a major label powerhouse with the spirit of an independent,\" adds Monte. \"In the last two years, we've had tremendous success with rock bands like Hinder and Godsmack. Our most recent signing is Colbie Caillat, who currently has the No. 1 song in the U.S., 'Bubbly.' Mika has become an interna - tional phenomenon; so has Amy Winehouse, who just received six Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year. Country phenom Taylor Swift has also been nominated for Best New Artist. And our No. 1-selling artist, Jack Johnson, put out a new album Feb. 5.\" In all, approximately 40 artists record on the Universal Republic label. The recording industry, according to Monte, \"is always changing. It's never the same year after year; there's a natural evolution to it. The way we produce and dis - tribute music will change. What won't change is the impact music has on culture and society.\" Both Lipmans use the abilities they acquired at Albany to manage Universal Republic's 200 employees, a quar - ter of whom are located in Manhattan, where the brothers work. Monte has drawn inspiration from \"the entrepreneurial spirit\" embraced by the School of Business. Avery, an English major who played junior- varsity football as a freshman, describes \"problem solv - ing, getting things done when there are seemingly impossible obstacles, becoming an adult and a respon - sible person, and coming into contact with people who are go-getters and can really make things happen\" as just a few of the lessons he mastered during \"the col- lege experience.\" He also acknowledges that he's found \"practical applications,\" such as \"writing promotional documents and things of that nature,\" for the language skills he sharpened as an undergraduate. You won't find Avery writing lyrics, however - or strumming a guitar or improvising a tune on the piano. \"The only thing I play,\" he jokes, \"is the radio.\" Harold Gould '47 Skits and Self-Discovery As a teenager, Harold Gould \"had done a lot of plays in high school\" and decided to enroll at the New York State College for Teachers at the suggestion of his aunt Eve, who had studied with Agnes Futterer, founder of the school's drama program. During his undergraduate years, \"I was fairly arrogant. I had a lot of self-confidence.\" Gould's \"early instincts were for comedy.\" World War II interrupted his college career. Gould served his country in the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP), then returned to State to complete his degree requirements. He earned graduate degrees from Cornell, then taught there and at a college in Virginia. Later, Gould also taught at the University of California, Riverside. In 1960, he took his first professional theatrical role in West Side Story and made his television d\u00e9but - as a police dispatcher on a program called \"Hong Kong\" - appearing on camera \"for about 15 seconds, sitting in front of a microphone.\" Gould is probably most recognizable to TV audiences from his portrayal of actress Valerie Harper's dad on \"Rhoda\" and \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" and for courting Betty White's character, Rose Nylund, in the long-running series \"The Golden Girls.\" The veteran actor has earned five Emmy nominations for his TV appearances. Other recognition has included an Obie for his Off-Broadway work in The Increased Difficulty of Concentration (1969), and a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Lead Performance in Incommunicado (1993). Gould also won acclaim for his role in John Guare's The House of Blue Leaves, which earned the New York Drama Critics Circle Award as Best American Play for 1970-71. Now 84, Gould also enjoys drama. Shakespeare's King Lear and Prospero are two of his favorite dramatic roles. His numerous Broadway appearances include roles in Fools, Artist Descending a Staircase, Grown Upsand Mixed Emotions. Gould's film work, which dates back more than three decades, includes performances in movies ranging from \"The Sting\" to \"Freaky Friday.\" Currently, he's portraying Moe , the straight-laced, good-natured pal of the more fun-loving Charlie, in Viagara Falls, a three-character comedy Gould describes as \"a combination of vaudeville, burlesque and a straightforward play.\" Popular with critics and audiences alike, the play has earned good reviews and standing ovations from California to Florida. If Viagara Falls heads for an Off-Broadway stint, as seems likely, Gould would enjoy con - tinuing in the role of Moe. Gould hopes that his acting will \"make life richer\" for his fans - and enable him \"to keep my sensibilities fresh and continue the process of self-discovery.\" [For more insight into Harold Gould's experience at the former New York State College for Teachers and his work, please turn to page 52.] Gina Muscato Singer Colbie Caillat (center, with Monte, left, and Avery) was recently signed by Universal Republic.

The inspiration? His mom's old Underwood typewriter. \"I found it in a closet, and I immediately started writing ripoffs of 'F Troop,'\" remembers the Peekskill, N.Y., native. \"Then I got start - ed on plays. I was the annoying neighborhood kid who always said, 'Let's put on a show!'\" As the author of such works as Stonewall's Bust, Engaging Shaw, Fashion Specificsand The Matchmaker's Guide to Controlling the Elements, Morogiello is still putting on shows today at venues ranging from regional the - atres to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He earned his undergraduate degree at Stony Brook, then enrolled at the University at Albany - \"a school so eager to have me, I was given a full fellowship.\" He planned to do advanced study after - ward at a school on the West Coast, but \"things changed when I met Martin Blanco. We struck up a pro - fessional partnership, and I never made it out to California,\" notes Morogiello, playwright in residence at the Maryland State Arts Council. For the Bronx, N.Y.-born Blanco, a SUNY school was the most logical choice, economically speaking, for college. He and his parents \"visited many universities, but I loved Edward Durell Stone's design of the Albany campus. It was a good school; the University never disappointed me. I felt totally satisfied, and I had a wonderful education. The acting program was superb. I was cast in a lot of character roles because I looked older and could play the age. I was mediocre as an actor, but I worked hard.\" Blanco studied English with Professor Harry Staley, \"an extraordi -nary teacher,\" and \"took many classes\" at both the undergraduate and graduate levels with Professor Jarka Burian. He also met his wife, radiologist Barbara Salvia Blanco, M.D., B.S.'85, at Albany. The couple, married nearly 17 years, has two children, Matthew, 8, and Kathryn, 6. After attending the Yale School of Drama, where he studied per - forming arts administration, Blanco worked in regional theatre \"for about 12 years.\" He currently freelances \"with my own projects.\" The Connecticut-based director and stay-at-home dad also fre - quently collaborates with Morogiello. They were disap - pointed last year when they had to scuttle a Boston production of the comedy Irish Authors Held Hostage after Blanco contracted Lyme disease. In the 90-minute series of sketches, Morogiello, who also plays some of the roles, imagines Oscar Wilde, James Joyce and other masters of the English word taken captive by such miscreants as a radical ter - rorist and a firearms enthusiast - to the eventual regret of the captors. Irish Authorswas popular with audiences in Washington and New York City, says Blanco, and would have done well in Boston. Blanco and Morogiello hope to mount the production, possibly this year, through J.T. Burian Theatricals, a company they formed several years ago as both a tribute to Burian and a play on the name P.T. Barnum, the showman who purportedly observed, \"There's a sucker born every minute.\" The company's Web page (www.jtburiantheatricals.com) features a biography of the fictional J.T. Burian, a 19th-century impresario who knew Chekhov, George Bernard Shaw and other giants of the theatre - and is still alive and producing shows.

Karl told him, \"Once you have your M.B.A., no one can take it away from you, and you'll be more marketable when you graduate.\" Bruno's UAlbany inspiration was William Danko, now profes - sor emeritus of marketing. \"He taught us how to do professional work and how to comport ourselves in the business world.\" When he's not at his \"day job,\" managing the Information Technology Program Management Office (ITPMO) for the City of Henderson's Department of Utility Services, Bruno is radio's \"Career Czar.\" He and Cathy, his wife of almost 18 years, approached alltalkradio.net, an Internet radio station, in 2007 with an idea for a program \"to help people with their careers. The station loved it, and here we are, on the air.\" For the one-hour weekly program, Bruno serves as \"on-air talent, show scheduler and head of all marketing efforts. It is truly a labor of love. I handle the entertainment and emcee duties; 'Coach Christine' Wunderlin provides the career expertise.\" The \"Career Czar\" has learned \"people truly don't know where to begin to build the career and life they want. They don't learn these skills in school. So we try to tell people they can have some control over their lives, set some goals, think about what they want to do, as opposed to letting the waves of life carry them along.\" Bruno's own \"extensive\" work experience includes strategic planning, project management, budgeting, staff development and training, and customer service and support. His greatest love (besides Cathy) is history. At the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Bruno is studying for a master's in the sub - ject, with a specialty in Nevada Politics 1920-1933. His original research paper, \"The Cole-Malley Scandal: Nevada's Political System Revealed,\" was published in the Summer 2007 Nevada Historical Society Quarterly . Bruno's affinity for history has inspired him to branch out into screenwriting. His screenplays include: \"'Duty's Call,' about Charles Young, the third African American to graduate from West Point, and the first to reach the rank of U.S. Army colonel; 'Sarah,' which focuses on Sarah Bagley, who organized the first labor union for women in 1840s Lowell, Mass.; and 'Ace,' the story of Lt. Frank Luke, the first Army Air Corps pilot to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.\" His screenplay \"The Jeep: An American Triumph\" has attracted interest and may \"possi - bly\" be produced for television, with production underwritten by \"some major sponsors.\" To help with his screenwriting, Bruno has taken courses in acting and stand-up comedy.

But his wife, Grayce Susan Burian, B.A'63, M.A.'64, seemed pleased by the honor, according to Blanco. \"It's a delightful tribute, and those who knew Jarka Burian would certainly under - stand it.\" \"Martin and I have made plans to produce a play of mine, Gianni Schicchi, under the J.T. Burian Theatricals banner sometime next year in Washington,\" Morogiello says. And this spring, Morogiello will bring Engaging Shaw to New Jersey Repertory Company. Former Albany theatre department chair Langdon Brown, with whom he's kept in touch, will direct the production. \"I was only there for three semesters, but the University affected me and my career in a profound way,\" notes Morogiello, who resides near the District of Columbia with his wife, Betsy, a scientist, and their sons, Evan, 13, and James, 12. Adds Blanco: \"Hardly a week goes by when I'm not using some - thing I learned at Albany. I can still hear Dr. Burian's voice in the back of my head: 'You can do better. Don't settle.' I've been very blessed.\" UALBANY MAGAZINE 24 Yvonne Perry is best known as a television, stage and commercial actress; voiceover artist; director Perry took her first acting class at age 11, with the Helderberg Workshop in her hometown, Voorheesville, N.Y. As a teenager, she acted with the Empire State Institute for the Performing Arts, now the New York State Theatre Institute (NYSTI). She earned a B.F.A. in acting at Adelphi University and an M.A. at UAlbany. Perry also studied at London's Royal National Theatre. Perry repaid her student loans by playing the role of Rosanna on the CBS soap opera \"As the World Turns.\" She has also been a featured performer in \"Guiding (CBS); dream is to do a sit-com . \"I shot the pilot for a sit-com called 'Dads' while living in L.A., but the show did not get picked up for a full season.\" Perry particularly enjoys theatre . \"Being onstage is a rush like no other . Plus, the writing is usually better.\" Her most recent stage roles have included Mrs. Kendal in The Elephant Man (with The Theatre Company at Hubbard Hall, Cambridge, N.Y.); Gwenda Vaughn in Ordeal by Innocence (NYSTI); and Mrs. VanBuren in Intimate Apparel(Capital Repertory). Last November, she auditioned in New York City for Capital Rep's M. Butterfly but didn't get the part. \"Not getting jobs,\" Perry observes, \"just makes an actress' successes that much sweeter!\" Perry returned to the Capital Region after years in New York and Los Angeles because \"my husband and most of my rather large family are here. I'm very close to my parents. And I just love people in the Northeast. I 'get' them.\" The actress also does voiceover work and/or appears on camera for such national and local advertisers as General Electric, McGraw-Hill, Taft Furniture and the New York State Department of Health. At UAlbany, she enjoys teaching Acting I - \"basically, an introduction class for monologue and scene study\" - two days a week; and covering such topics as \"funda - mentals of text analysis and a general appreciation of what it takes to 'put on a show' - any type of show.\" Teaching, Perry says, \"offers me flexibility, and I love the diversity of the student body. Acting should be fun, and to do it well, you must encourage a personal sense of play - always. But acting is also work, and there is a skill set involved. You have to work if you want to play!\" On the personal front, Perry's husband, Mark Hulbert , is a financial adviser who owns Hulbert Financial Group. Their daughters, Josie, 7, and Justine, 5 , adopted from China, are the actress' \"other great passion!\" [For more about Yvonne Perry, visit her Web site at www.yvonneperry.com.] Yvonne Perry in a scene from Intimate Apparel, 2006 Yvonne Perry, M.A.'00 Actress-Teacher Enjoys the Spotlight WINTER 2008 25 \"Presidential Honors Society: Striving to Make a Difference By Whitney Sperrazza How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.\" When Anne Frank wrote those words, she was writ - ing about service performed for the good of others, service that helps change the world one individual at a time. That's the type of service members of the University at Albany's Presidential Honors Society (PHS) perform every day. Since its founding, PHS has made many contributions to the UAlbany community and its neighbors. In 1991, stu - dents Brian Kerr and Kevin McIntyre, with the support of Professor Sung Bok Kim, envisioned the society as a means of bringing the brightest students at the University together to make a commitment to community service. Initially, 15 students performed 500 hours of community service a year through PHS. Today, more than 200 students give 8,000 hours annually of their time and talent to such national charities as the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association; and to local organizations, including St. Peter's Hospital, the Regional Food Bank and Capital City Rescue Mission. Last year, PHS reached out on a global scale, collecting more than 1,800 books to assist with literacy efforts in Africa. While all of these initiatives are central to the PHS mission, society members feel that serving their fellow students is among their most important objectives. One of the society's major initiatives, Campus Clean-Up Day, was begun in 1996. Today, many UAlbany students enjoy participating in that tradition. Recently, PHS adopted Albany Boy Scout Troop 413, \"setting up study sessions and social and 'shadowing' events, both down - town and on campus,\" explains physics major Nicholas Fahrenkopf, the society's vice president. \"Some members have helped with camping and other activities related to earn -ing badges.\" The scouts and PHS joined forces on a neighborhood cleanup project in Albany's South End last fall. \"We also recently assisted the scouts with their fundraising drive, selling popcorn,\" Fahrenkopf adds. The PHS-Troop 413 partnership - the dream of PHS alumnus and troop leader Kevin Grossman - \"went way beyond\" his expecta - tions. \"The students truly have made a difference. I'm really looking forward to continuing this rela - tionship through the spring semester,\" Grossman says. Others also appreciate the outstanding work PHS students do each year. The organization has won several President's Awards from the University, and individual members are also honored for their contributions. Says PHS adviser and Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Education Dan Smith: \"This really is an outstanding group of individuals. They raise the bar every year, and I'm very proud to be working with them.\" Society members are looking for new opportunities for service \"so we can take our group to that next level of excellence and service,\" notes Fahrenkopf. To that end, \"we're trying to establish some really strong connections with our former members.\" While alumni outreach is one of its biggest goals for 2008 and beyond, the group will not stop there. This spring, PHS is kicking off a \"Give It Up Campaign\" to increase on-campus awareness of hunger and poverty in Third World countries. And members will continue their involvement with Boy Scout Troop 413. [PHS President Whitney Sperrazza will graduate later this year. Presidential Honors Society alumni who would like to help the group's members make a difference, on and off campus, may contact her at wsperrazza@gmail.com.] UALBANY MAGAZINE 26 Gerald D. Jennings, M.S.'76, has been mayor of Albany since 1994. Currently serving his fourth term as the chief executive of New York's capital city, the Albany native turned to politics after 21 years as a teacher and administrator in the city's school district. Jennings represented the 11th Ward (the Pine Hills neighborhood) on the Albany Common Council for 13 years prior to winning his first mayoral victory in November 1993. He recently mused about the role he has played in the future of both Albanys - city and university.Great City , Great University Q. You're a hometown boy, aren't you? A. I was born and raised in Albany. My mom, who raised my older brother, sister and me by herself, really stressed the importance of getting an education, and of hard work. At 14, I started work - ing as a counselor in a city program at the CYO (Catholic Youth Organization) Center on First Street; I did that for several years. I played high school sports, and these involvements kept me busy and out of trouble! Q. Why did you want to teach? A. I decided to become a teacher because I admired the teachers I had. I earned my teaching degree at SUNY Brockport, and my master's in educational administration at UAlbany. I began teaching at age 21, and then became an administrator when I was 25. It was an incredibly rewarding experience. I have devoted my professional career to kids because they're extremely important to me. Q. Why did you make the jump to politics? A. At Albany High, the kids are a microcosm of the city. They told me what they were seeing, and I wanted to make a difference for them. That's one of the reasons I ran for mayor. Q. How would you describe your experience at the University? A. I met a lot of great people at UAlbany. They talked with me about my career and my goals, and they encouraged me to pursue my interests and opportunities. Q. How do you use your experience as a student, a teacher, an administrator, and now as mayor to try to make life better for the young people of Albany? A. Through our collective work and youth programs, we employ about 1,500 people each summer. We partner with not-for- profits; for instance, we place students in internships at the Albany College of Pharmacy and Albany NanoTech. I want them to obtain positive exposure - to see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. I want them to appreciate that if they get a proper education, work hard, and listen to adults who want them to be successful, they will succeed. Q. How, in your estimation, has UAlbany evolved over the years? A. At the high school, UAlbany students would be in the building and serve as tutors for our kids. It was good experience for the students from the University; it gave them some perspective in the classroom, and broadened their horizons. I represented UAlbany on the Common Council, and, as mayor, I've seen how critical the University is to the city's growth. UAlbany is a great partner; we have nurtured a tradition of working together, and I want to see the University continue to grow. We have a University that we can be proud of, and the application and enrollment numbers are a testament to this. Students not only receive an outstanding education, but also are provided an opportunity for personal and professional growth. In addition, the University has expanded many programs, and introduced others, such as the UAlbany-Albany High School Alliance for Young Talent. Its Division I sports program has gar - nered national attention, as has the New York Giants' training camp, held on the uptown campus each summer. Discussion of [UAlbany's proposed] stadium is long overdue. \"Jerry is a man of his word ... When he tells you that you're going to accomplish something together and you make a commitment, he always follows through. It always happens.\" - Michael Castellana, B.S. '84, M.B.A.'92; President and CEO, SEFCU WINTER 2008 27 \"He understands the value of being accessible, whether it's to a college or high-school kid, in the corporate boardroom or around a neighbor's dining-room table.I think he has a unique perspective on making people comfortable.\" - F. Michael Tucker, President and CEO, Center for Economic Growth Teamwork is the key to getting things done. He's basically been the catalyst to provide for an environment of teamwork.\" - George Philip, Esq., B.A.'69, M.A.'73, Interim President, University at Albany Gary Gold '70 UALBANY MAGAZINE 28 Q. What would you like to see the city and the University accomplish together in the immediate future? A. The City of Albany benefits from having young people here. We have to create opportunities for them, and we're working with the University to do that. We don't want to continue to export our young people from New York State or the Capital Region after they graduate. We should provide good job opportunities for them; that's the goal. We want our young people to remember that they received a good education and got a great start here. We have to continue to make an impact on the people who live, work and visit here. One of Albany's greatest assets is the University. It's one of the selling points I use with businesses and with individuals who are thinking of relocating. \"I'll call him a University-community citizen. Frankly, his achievements have benefited not only the lives of Albany residents; they've also benefited and enhanced the lives of the faculty, students and staff of this great University ... He's a very strong leader - an exquisite collaborator, innovator and thinker, all wrapped in what I think of as the 'Three T's' about Jerry: tall, tan and tailored, all year long.\" - Canon Kay C. Hotaling, B.S.'67, M.S.'70, University at Albany Alumni Association Board Member UAlbany students Jacob Crawford, Michael Cassidy, Kim Cutler, Brian Tregerman, Jonathan Tiech and Colin Ebel congratulated Jennings at the gala. The next day, he received the Medallion of the University from Interim President George Philip. For his service to his city and his alma mater, Albany Mayor Gerald D. Jennings was honored at a black- tie gala Dec. 8 at SEFCU Arena, and at a special presentation the following day during the winter commencement ceremony. More than 400 guests attended the gala, which featured a video tribute to Jennings and musical performances by the Brian Patneaude Quartet and UAlbany's own Earth Tones. The program also included the announcement that an endowed scholarship fund had been established in Jennings' name. The Gerald D. Jennings Class of '76 Scholarship Fund will benefit deserving students from the City of Albany; financial need and academic achievement will be taken into consideration in determining award recipients. On Dec. 9, the mayor received the Medallion of the University, UAlbany's most prestigious award for extraordinary service and leadership. \"I am proud to have graduated from the University,\" Jennings noted after the presentation, \"and I have been privileged to partner with UAlbany for the betterment of the city, its people and the entire community.\" Contributions are being accepted for The Gerald D. Jennings Class of '76 Scholarship Fund , which currently totals $60,000.

It's a form of inspiration - \"a gesture\" from one person with a visual disability \"reaching out to another.\" The scholarship endowment provides funding for tuition, room and board, \"and a little more,\" Howard Swartz, a retired consultant, said when he and his wife established the award in 2006. He acknowledged having struggled through school because of a visual impairment. The couple, who reside in Florida, wanted their $300,000 gift to support students \"who were visually handicapped, though not necessarily blind, or disabled,\" added UAlbany alumna Goldie Brenner Swartz, a retired fifth-grade teacher. \"We wanted to give someone an opportunity to overcome that disability and lead a successful life.\" Jean-Baptiste, a native of Brooklyn, N.Y., \"was born with sight, but prematurely.\" She needed more oxygen and was placed in an incubator; however, \"both of my retinas were completely damaged as a result of having too much oxygen, leaving me with absolutely no vision. My eye condition is called retinopathy of prematurity, or ROP,\" explained the psychology major. With the award, \"Mr. and Mrs. Swartz have allowed me to continue this part of my academic journey. They have paved the way for me to accomplish my goals and dreams, and I hope that I could do the same for someone else.\" Jean-Baptiste, who minors in education, will have that opportunity. \"I would like to continue on to grad school in counseling psychology. I am interested in working with teenagers.\" Two other undergraduates have also received the Swartz Scholarship.

The project is supported by grants of $10,000 each from The Dominic Ferraioli Foundation, based in Johnstown, N.Y., and The Bender Scientific Fund of The Community Foundation for the Capital Region. Scott Tenenbaum, Ph.D., a molecular geneticist at the CRC, and Michael Perrotti, M.D., a urologist at St. Peter's, are teaming to investigate how effective Dutasteride might be in eradicating prostate cancer. The drug was originally formulated to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia; it has also shown some promise as a remedy for hair loss resulting from male-pattern baldness. Twenty-five men from around the Capital Region are participating in the trial. Prostate cancer, the most common non-der - matological form of cancer in the nation, is a leading cause of mortality in adult males. Every year, an estimated 220,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 30,000 die of the disease. Dominic Ferraioli, a businessman from Guilderland, N.Y., established the founda - tion that bears his name several years ago through his last will and testament. The Bender Scientific Fund of The Community Foundation for the Capital Region makes grants to support and promote discovery and development in medicine, science and technology in the Capital District.Littauer Foundation Augments Axelrod Fellowship In keeping with the philanthropic vision of its namesake, the Lucius N. Littauer Foundation, Inc., recently awarded a $25,000 grant to the School of Public Health's David Axelrod Fellowship. The funding brings the total amount of the endowment - which provides support for outstanding students preparing for careers in public health and public policy - to $325,000. The fund, which honors the late New York State health commis - sioner, David A. Axelrod, was established in 1994. In the years since, fellowship recipients have gone on to careers in the public- health field, studying hazardous waste sites, airborne chemicals, adolescent health-risk behaviors, infectious disease and other fac - tors that impact the health and safety of their fellow citizens, and recommending appropriate policy implementation or alteration. To date, 16 students have received the fellowship. Named for a Gloversville, N.Y., native who became both a success - ful businessman and a five-term U.S. congressman, the Lucius N. Littauer Foundation supports various causes related primarily to education and health. Today, Tomorrow, Forever! Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie did it. Kellogg did it by selling cornflakes; Kresge did it with K-Mart. Bill Gates did it, and so can you...and with much less! Have you considered establishing an endowment fund at UAlbany - a permanent fund in your name (or the name of a loved one) that will support your alma mater in perpetuity? The University has more than 300 endowments - funds that provide scholarships to students, purchase library resources, award research grants, sponsor graduate fel- lowships, assist specific departments and programs, and support a host of educational initiatives central to the University's mission. Each one carries the name of the donor, or of a family member or friend, associating that name with UAlbany for generations to come. You don't have to be a Rockefeller to make a difference in a student's life; you just have to care.

Or better yet, become part of the discussion. Because while I am solely responsible for the content of this column, there are ample opportunities for alumni to create and share their own content with one another through vari - ous online tools and discussion forums. The Internet continues to evolve into a much more interactive environment, with users sharing information. UAlbany alumni are using these tools and staying connected in ways that, until recently, weren't popular or even possible. Log onto www.albany.edu/alumni and click on the Online Community/Directory button to find a classmate, use the Career Center, get a permanent e-mail address and much more. While the University and the Alumni Association do not monitor, control or endorse the content of out - side forums, here are a few other sites that UAlbany alumni use to keep in touch with one another. Facebook (www.facebook.com) is a social network - ing site that previously was only available to college students. Now, anyone can create user profiles by posting their interests, activities and photos. I invite you to join my favorite facebook group: UAlbany Alumni Association. For professional networking, many alumni are also using LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com). By inviting fellow UAlbany alumni, you can quickly expand your professional network, taking advan - tage of the adage \"It's not just what you know, but whom you know.\" With the rise of the UAlbany Division One Athletics' program there is even a \"Cyber Home of UAlbany Great Danes Fans\" (www.bigpurplefans.ipbhost.com). Of course, there are concerns with user-controlled media, but with a little proofreading and some common courtesy (not to mention common sense), these tools will help us all build a stronger alumni community.

Darby Penney recently received a 79 You might not think a family man who's also a financial manager would be one of the most adventurous people around. Then again, you probably haven't met John Troiano. Troiano resides in Portsmouth, N.H., with his wife, Jennifer, and children: Alicia, 14; Stephen, 12; and Matthew, 10. During a typi - cal workday at his office nearby, the mild- mannered financial wizard, who ranks among the top 1 percent of the advisers in his firm, A.G. Edwards, performs magic for the approx - imately 1,000 clients who do business with him. He's been with the company since 1988 and wryly observes: \"A lot of my newer clients are in their 30s. I worked with their parents when these newer clients were only in their teens.\" Troiano doesn't seek out his clients; they find him by word of mouth. And he's never met most of them. Instead, he \"psycho - analyzes\" them on the phone, \"determining their risk tolerances and assessing what's going to be right for particular clients.\" Troiano's psychology degree has come in handy in that regard. He settled on his major after first trying accounting, then computer science. But Troiano, who characterizes him - self as a technophobe - he doesn't own a cell phone and won't use a laptop - decided to major in psychology when \"a professor came into class one day wearing a striped shirt and plaid pants. I didn't want to end up like that,\" he jokes. In fact, his psychology studies have been \"more useful than anything else\" in the financial management field. \"So much about investing is the study of human behavior. Two emotions - fear and greed - rule the stock market.\" When he isn't analyzing his clients and their tolerance for financial risk, Troiano, 46, toler - ates a fair amount of risk himself. An avid traveler, he has visited Tibet and Nepal, among other exotic locales, and gone on safari. For two weeks last September and October, he and four friends embarked on the ultimate adventure: a two-week trip to Tanzania, where they scaled Mount Kilimanjaro. \"It took us five days to reach the summit and two to climb down,\" notes Troiano, adding that the group was accompa - nied by 20 locals who served as porters and guides, carrying equipment and setting up camp on the 19,335-foot climb. To prepare for the trip, Troiano, who enjoyed Camp Dippikill as an undergrad and used to return to the Adirondack retreat yearly for get-togethers with UAlbany chums, climbed New Hampshire's Mount Washington \"a cou - ple of times.\" He describes his latest adventure as \"the experi - ence of a lifetime\" but found it \"funny\" when Tanzanians told him that they don't hike Kilimanjaro. \"They told me: 'That's crazy. Only the tourists do that,'\" he laughs. Still, Troiano feels that everyone needs an adventure every so often. \"There's more to life than sitting behind a desk or lying on a beach,\" he says philosophically. \"It's OK to get older, as long as you don't get old.\" John Troiano, B.A.'83 John Troiano, right, with his Kilimanjaro guide, Manuel Bruce Plaxen UALBANY MAGAZINE 40 Alumni News and Notes Teammates By Brad Rabinowitz, B.A.'85 I met Alan Cornfield in fourth grade, when he transferred to my school. With a name like that, he was hard to miss. Alan and I became instant friends, and that friendship grew through lacrosse. We played together starting in ninth grade. He was the goalie; I was a midfielder - and, from day one, he took a special pride in making sure I never scored on him in practice. If I went high, he went high; if I went low, he went low. Our friendly rivalry continued at Oceanside High School on Long Island, then at the University at Albany, where Alan set almost every goalie record possible - records he still holds - during our four years with the lacrosse team. Watching him warm up, the other teams must have been intimidated by the intensity with which he tried to save every single shot I took. One day, during a practice, I told my teammate Ricky Trizano, who was covering me on defense, to slack off a little because I wanted to fire a laser at Alan's head. Ricky stepped back a few feet, Coach blew the whistle, and I unleashed a shot as hard as any I had ever made in my life. Instead of going in the goal, the ball lodged in his facemask. Completely surprised, Alan took off down the field, the ball still stuck in his facemask, run - ning straight at me for what I thought would be our first knock-down, drag-out fight. To my surprise, he continued past me, then dove headfirst into the other goal, making sure not to touch the crease before his helmet, where the ball was. The ball landed in the goal, and the whole field erupted with laughter. It was one of the funniest things I had ever seen on a lacrosse field! After college, we played on various teams together, and our lives moved in familiar patterns. I was Alan's best man at his wedding; he was mine. I was his son's godfather. We also worked together: I was the lawyer representing his mortgage banking company. It seemed as if we would be teammates and friends forever. On Oct. 1, 2001, however, I received a call that would change my life. Alan had gone fishing with his dad. A freak storm had struck just as they were heading back in, and Alan - a lifeguard, volunteer fireman and experienced fisherman - went overboard and drowned. The call, from Alan's sister-in-law, knocked me to my knees in disbelief, rage, sadness. The next few days flew by with funeral arrangements, eulogy preparation and attempts to bring some peace to his distraught family. The funeral was a blur, but the presence of all of our former teammates, coaches and trainers, and the lacrosse stories told over the next few weeks, really helped me get through a horrible time. Alan's life was cut way too short, but he left endless memories for me, both on and off the lacrosse field. Too often, we take our team - mates for granted, not realizing how lucky we are to be playing a game we love and to be forming bonds through that sport. I know I will see Alan again. And when I do, he'd better be ready, because I plan to fake high and shoot low. There is no doubt in my mind that he will make the save!

However, thanks to the generosity of the founder and president of LinguaLinx Language Solutions, Inc., that option will be available to three undergraduates through UAlbany's Office of International Education: Study Abroad & Exchanges. \"I never had the opportunity to travel to Russia until graduate school,\" recalled Smith, who also earned a certificate in translation. With the $6,000 gift he has made to support scholarships, he will give three undergraduate students that experience \"earlier in their careers.\" After he received his C.A.S., the University's Office of International Programs \"sent me to Russia to direct our exchange program for nine months.\" Smith returned to Albany and worked briefly as a stockbroker, then relocated to New York City, where he worked for a translation firm, and later for its dot.com sister company. In 2002, Smith founded LinguaLinx out of his home in Westchester County. He moved the firm to the Capital Region in December 2003. \"I always liked it up here,\" said the Utica, N.Y., native. \"I have family here; the cost of living is less than it is downstate; and, for business purposes, it's close to New York, Boston and Montreal.\" LinguaLinx provides a variety of services, ranging from \"traditional translation of docu - ments\" to and from French, German, Russian, Chinese, and a host of other languages, includ - ing American Sign Language and Braille, to \"Web site localization and cultural consulting.\" The Schenectady-based firm's clientele includes corporate, non-profit and government entities. LinguaLinx began with just one employee: Smith himself. The company now has a staff of 45, and its potential for expansion is great. LinguaLinx recently opened an office in San Francisco's Financial District; eventually, Smith also expects to launch operations in Canada and China, and to oversee a staff of 100. According to the Capital District Business Review, LinguaLinx currently ranks as \"the 49th-largest private employer, and the 32nd- largest technology company, in the area,\" Smith noted. In addition, the newspaper recognized the company's founder as one of the Capital Region's \"40 Under Forty\" business leaders for 2005. While Smith has established the scholarships to express his gratitude to UAlbany for the oppor - tunities that have, in part, contributed to his success, he has found other ways to thank his alma mater, too. Students from the University participate in a LinguaLinx internship program that provides both practical experience and academic credit. \"Two of our full-time employ - ees started in that program,\" he said. Smith also returns to campus occasionally to speak to classes. \"I want to make sure students under - stand there are a variety of career options, other than teaching or translating, available with a language degree,\" he said.David Smith, B.A.'90; M.A.'94; C.A.S.'95 Saying Thanks by Supporting Students Pictured with LinguaLinx founder David Smith, B.A.'90; M.A.'94; C.A.S.'95, are Holly Baranowski (left) and Jocelynn Rizzi (right), recipients of the first two scholarships Smith established through the University's Office of International Education: Study Abroad & Exchanges.

But when we do, its value is immeasurable. UAlbany's Career Services offers a variety of career tools and services for alumni. Chief among them is direct career counsel- ing. \"Career Services offers one-on-one counseling to hundreds of alumni each year,\" said Noah Simon, assistant director of Career Services. \"Just because an alumnus isn't local doesn't mean he or she can't take advantage of our services. I have had the opportunity to speak with alumni all over the country regarding their career situation and how we can assist them.\" For alumni looking to make a career change, Simon puts them through a series of exercises designed to help them discover what they want to do with their lives. He critiques r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters, and helps alumni con - nect with UAlbany's extensive alumni network. \"Often, for our recent graduates, much of the work we do involves dis - cussing techniques for job search as well as resume and cover letter critiques,\" Simon noted. \"We offer the same services to alumni with more experience, but often there is a career change involved. We'll discuss what the individual hopes to gain from their career, - what have they accomplished in the past, what they hope to accomplish in the future and what skills are transferable from one career to another.\" The Internet has made career networking much easier, Simon noted. In 2001, UAlbany launched AlumNet, an online database of UAlbany alumni who can provide valuable connections and information on job search strategies, specific companies, indus - try trends and professional organizations. Alumni can access the network through the UAlbany alumni online community, which offers a job board; alumni also have access to MonsterTrak and other job banks. Earlier this year, Career Services began offering alumni access to CareerSearch, an Internet tool that provides fast, up-to-date information on potential employers in a variety of industries and fields both nationally and internationally. Simon notes that the increasing demand for career counseling reflects the way the working world has changed. Researchers say that, on average, new college graduates will have several careers and up to a dozen jobs during their working lives. \"Times have changed,\" said Simon. \"It's important for our alumni to be able to come back to a place they trust and get the help they need to be successful.\" CAREER SERVICES Noah Simon meets with an alumna to discuss career options.

James became a class councilor in 1987 and was a vital part of the Council of Classes and Alumni Association for more than 20 years. The Alumni Association is grateful for his service and devotion to his alma mater. He will be missed. Richard Callner Professor Emeritus of Art Richard Callner, who was instrumental in found - ing the University at Albany's M.F.A. program in the 1970s, passed away Aug. 31, 2007, at the age of 80. Callner spent his childhood in the Midwest and left school at 17 to serve in the U.S. Navy toward the end of World War II. Following his discharge from the service in 1946, he earned his B.A. from the University of Wisconsin, studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris and received an M.F.A. at Columbia University. Callner began his academic career at Purdue University in Indiana. Supported by a Guggenheim Fellowship, he spent a year in England and France, and later taught at Temple University's Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia. He also served as found - ing director of Temple's Tyler Art School in Rome, Italy. During his two decades with the University at Albany, Callner continued to distinguish himself as an artist, and as a teacher and a mentor to hun - dreds of students. A Fulbright recipient, he traveled extensively in Europe and Asia, and became the first American artist to speak at the Hermitage in the former Soviet Union. He retired from the University in 1993. An artist for 50 years, Callner continued to paint even after the onset of Parkinson's disease, favoring both an increased use of abstraction and more vivid color as the disease progressed. His works, which also include prints, etchings and sculpture, are among the holdings at public and private collections in Russia, Turkey, and Yugoslavia; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the New York Public Library; colleges, museums and art institutes throughout the world; and the University at Albany Art Museum. Callner's survivors include his wife, Carolyn; a son, David; a daughter, Joanna; and two grandchildren.Alan A. Tamaroff'63, Oct. 12, 2007 Frances Miller Bogdansky '64, June 24, 2007 Ronald L.

Frisch, Ph.D., Distinguished Service Professor, Chemistry, Sept. 21, 2007 WINTER 2008 51 Letters to the Editor ONLY ONE LOUIS R. SALKEVER The Fall 2007 \"Alumni News and Notes\" section, page 51, carries a death notice for Louis R. Salkever and lists him as \"Lecturer, Economics, 1965-1988, July 1, 1995.\" I am pretty sure this is the same Louis R. Salkever who was dean of Graduate Studies at Albany in the early 1970s. That I know because I was a graduate assistant working for Paul Saimond at the time, and he reported directly to Dr. Salkever. I believe that Dr. Salkever suc - ceeded Dr. Edgar Flinton as dean of Graduate Studies. Dr. Salkever earned his doctorate (1951) in labor economics (wage theory) from the Industrial & Labor Relations School at Cornell, which is another reason the name sticks in my mind. The reason I am writ - ing is that his appointment at one time at Albany involved more than that of merely a lecturer in economics. I realize I may be a bit reckless, but how many Louis R. Salkevers can there be out there? For the record, he was born in 1914 and his middle name was Romov. That we established from our online catalog because we have his thesis in the Martin P. Catherwood Library at Cornell University's School of Industrial & Labor Relations. Incidentally, great magazine ... UAlbany . When I retire someday, I will make more time to reconnect with the University at Albany. I am very proud to have earned three degrees from there, and I gained much from the experience. Gordon T. Law Jr., B.A.'67, M.A.'68, M.L.S.'72 Ithaca, NY [Editor's note: As Gordon Law writes, Louis R. Salkever was indeed vice presi- dent for Research and dean of Graduate Studies at UAlbany (1971-79.) Hired as a full professor in 1965, he chaired the economics department for three years. Salkever retired as professor emeritus in 1982 but continued to lecture on a part-time basis until 1988.] ANOTHER 'LAST WORD' ON THE DANES There is nothing wrong with the school mascot's being a Great Dane [\"The Last Word,\" page 52, Fall 2007 UAlbany ]. What caused a lot of resentment at the time was the fact that no one from the athletic department was on the selection committee. I know this to be true because I was a student assistant to the athletic director from 1964 through 1966. Mr. [Merlin] Hathaway was not very happy that neither he nor anyone from his athletic coaching staff was selected for that mas - cot committee. When I would ask the coaches what they thought of the new name, they would just smile and really not say much of anything. Like it or not, a school mascot is usually identified with the school's seasonal team sports. So, not having a coach or the athlet - ic director on the selection committee was a bit of a snub. Years later, however, I was very proud of the way the Great Danes took it to the Connecticut Huskies during the first half of that NCAA regional basketball game!

Certainly, my work with Agnes Futterer in her drama classes was crucial. She converted me from a smug little know-it-all high- school performer given to self-indulgent exhibitionism into some - one more disciplined. She alerted me to the power of language, and the need to vocalize it with clarity and variety. And, as I came to realize, her emphasis on attention to language as a means of deter - mining character and intent in a play vivified my classes in poetry and the novel in English literature. But I must say, though I have tried to incorporate such training in my professional work, and it continues to enrich my reading, it has also had a depressing effect. It has made me a restless and cranky witness of most movies, many television programs and even live theatre performances in their careless treatment of language. Necessary exposition, important plot revelations and crucial dramatic moments are often performed with unintelligible, slurred speech, or obscured by sound and visual effects. (Oh dear, have the standards I acquired At State College actually poisoned my enjoyment of these performing arts?) A happier effect of my State College expe - rience was the opportunity to develop my comic instincts. Every Friday, the entire student body would assemble in Page Auditorium to learn of school events for the upcoming week. I often took turns delivering such information in brief skits or musical jingles, and my frequent success in these efforts previewed that portion of my career spent in sketch work with Carol Burnett, Red Skelton, Danny Kaye, Jack Benny, Red Buttons, Carl Reiner, Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and others. In common with my contemporaries at State College, I spent a good portion of the curriculum in education courses prescribed to further the school's main goal of teacher preparation. At the time, I thought these classes fairly arid and unproductive, and I resigned myself to enduring them. But as I now look back on them, I think they may possibly have enriched my work as an actor. Especially when I was performing works of Shakespeare, Shaw, Ibsen, Moli\u00e8re, Stoppard, Arthur Miller, Pirandello, Vaclav Havel, etc., my approach as an actor was to share my understanding of my character and the text with the class, the audience - not to perform at them but to maintain their attention, excite their interest and invite them into the play as I saw it. Some of the best classroom learning I experienced from elemen - tary to graduate school came from teachers whose immersion in their subject matter and whose enthusiasm for it sparked a similar response in me. If the enjoyment, skill and love of my work engen - dered at State College helped to produce for my audiences laughter, along with a heightened aware - ness of the human condition, I would deem myself fulfilled in my chosen profession.
