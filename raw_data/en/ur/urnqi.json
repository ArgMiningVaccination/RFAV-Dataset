A disease is manifested when the delicate balance between the doshas is disturbed. An Ayurvedic cleanse draws out the toxins from the body, also drawing out excess vata, pitta, and kapha from the tissues into the digestive tract in order to eliminate them. This, in turn, unblocks the channels and restores balance. This cleanse is known as Panchakarma, which literally means five actions or procedures. It is a method of cleansing the body of all unwanted waste after lubricating the body. This treatment is highly beneficial as it includes preventive and curative actions for various diseases. Benefits of Panchakarma - Cleared toxins from the entire system - Balanced doshas - Healed digestive system - Enhanced immunity - Decreased stress - Anti-aging - Improved skin lustre - Weight-loss (if overweight) - Deep relaxation - Meditative outlook on life - Enhanced mindfulness Panchakarma Treatment Procedure The complete process of Panchakarma involves the following three steps: 1. Poorva Karma This is a preparatory procedure required before the main treatment, to soften the tissues so that the lipid-soluble toxins deposited into them are liquefied and flow back into the digestive tract. From here, they can be eliminated. This treatment prepares the patient mentally and physically for the main procedure of Panchakarma. It involves three procedures: - Pachan Karma - improves digestion with herbs and fasting so that the patient can digest the ghee (clarified butter) which is provided to liquefy the fat-soluble toxins. - Snehan Karma - medicated ghee is given to the patient in increasing doses in order to aggravate and liquefy the fat-soluble toxins deposited in the deep tissues. - Swedan Karma - a full body steam bath is given to the patient thereby opening up the body channels and allowing the heat to liquefy the toxins further. This facilitates their movement from the tissues to the digestive tract. 2. Pradhan Karma This is the Panchakarma, a five-step procedure which is highly individualized depending on the needs, age, digestive strength, immune system, and other factors. This intense Panchakarma procedure can only be done under the guidance of an Ayurvedic practitioner. The five karmas to cleanse the complete body are: - Vamanam (therapeutic emesis) - induced vomiting which helps clear the upper GI tract to the duodenum (end of the stomach) and a part of the respiratory tract. - Virechanam (purgation) - induced purgation clears the GI tract from the duodenum to the exit. - Anuvasana (enema using medicated oil) - the oil enema helps lubricate the rectal area and remove the lipid soluble waste out through the anus. - Nasyam - nasal inhalation of medicated substances which help clear the respiratory tract and the para nasal sinuses. 3. Paschaat Karma This is a regime to restore the body's digestive and absorptive capacity to its normal state. It includes rejuvenating treatments, lifestyle management, diet management, and intake of herbal supplements. It includes the following procedures: - Sansarjan Karma - food therapy after detoxification, which aims at gradually increasing the patient's diet from liquids to semi-solids to a normal diet. - Rasayan Adi Prayogam - a rejuvenating rasayan therapy which aids in increasing natural immunity and enhancing your general well-being. - Shaman Chikitsa - a pacification therapy with herbs and lifestyle management. It is important to note that a panchakarma procedure is designed specifically for an individual after a thorough physical examination and pulse diagnosis. Hence, there is no universal package for everybody. These treatments can take a minimum of 7 days and may last as long as 21 days. Who can be restored to a state of balance and harmony. Precautions Certain Panchakarma procedures are not suitable for certain health problems and some procedures should not be performed on children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Panchakarma treatments should only be performed by qualified and experienced Ayurvedic practitioners. Side Effects of Panchakarma Common side effects of Panchakarma include fatigue, malaise, headaches, congestion, and general illness. An initial increase in the symptoms may also occur as a side effect. It is also important to note that as Panchakarma seeks to release stored emotional problems, some patients can experience mental disturbances and depression during the course of treatment.
