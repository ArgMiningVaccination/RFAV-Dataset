DAVID KIPPER Doctor in private practice, Beverly Hills I see these alternative forms of health care as more on the therapeutic side. Although I think they have their role, I think the primary responsibility in the near future is going to be on the preventive side. I think chiropractic provides that, by the way. I think chiropractic is different and stands alone in the list of other alternative health care. All doctors need to be incorporated in taking care of people. You don't treat 10 people with the same illness the same. You have to factor in their cultural bias, their age, their sex, their sensitivity to medicine and level of education. BRUCE C. OPPENHEIM Chiropractor, owns a clinic in Toluca Lake It makes sense for chiropractors to continue as primary-care physicians as it will probably keep health care costs down. In the long run, preventive care is less expensive than crisis care. Conservative care keeps costs down. Surgery and hospitalization are very costly. You need someone to screen patients, and who better than chiropractors? To exclude chiropractic from a national health-care system is like going back to the dark ages of medicine. Having low-cost alternative health care will save money. Last year, my nanny cut her finger and had to go to the emergency room. She literally came home with a Band-Aid on her finger. She had a few shots, but no stitches. The bill came to $1,100. SUZETTE LEE Staff doctor, Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, West Los Angeles One thing that you have to consider when you talk about alternative medicine is what does it include exactly, what kind of services are provided and what kind of benefits can people receive from these types of medical treatments. Western medicine doesn't always have all the answers to many of the illnesses that we see today. Certain types of alternative medicine can be attempted. On a national level it's a little bit more difficult. What the government likes to do in terms of relegating funds to any type of particular group really has to do with research that's been done in that area and whether that research has proven that a group can make a successful contribution to medical care. There are some groups that probably do deserve to have money in a national system, but they might not get it because of the lack of research in a particular area. STEPHAN KORSIA Program manager, treatment education, AIDS Project L.A. I'd like to see in a national health care system room for alternative medicine that is really organized, meaning traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, the use of herbs and nutritional therapy. Chiropractic is already in mainstream medicine. I don't think it is reasonable to expect a national health plan to reimburse for everything you can come up with. If they want cost effectiveness, it's immunization and preventive medicine (that are important). There's no secret about it. In ancient China, people had their own physicians and they would pay them every month they were healthy. If they got sick, they stopped paying. In Western society, the research is geared toward fixing the problem. It's never geared to preventing the problem. CHRISTINE ANDERSON Chiropractor in private practice, Hollywood Chiropractors aren't necessarily seen as synonymous with primary-care providers. I'd like to see people coming to us first, rather than being referred from a medical doctor or another facility. Australia is the pioneer in utilizing chiropractors in (that way). In Australia, it has already been proven that by having chiropractors as primary health care providers costs are way down. Surgery is down substantially. When you get off the plane in Australia you receive an information booklet. It lists an emergency chiropractor. You can get quality service from an alternative health care provider. Just because it costs less doesn't mean it's of lesser quality. JOEL PENNER Acupuncturist, North Hollywood Basically, Chinese medicine can fit in really well because of the preventive aspect of it. Acupuncture is very effective for pain; that's what it's known for. Because it brings the system back into balance, it's very effective for treating degenerative disease. We have Chinese herbs that work similar to antibiotics, and we have herbs that are tonic in nature. They work to strengthen the body so that it can prevent diseases, strengthening the immune system and assisting the body to fight off diseases. The herbs are basically whole foods and have their own buffers, so there are fewer side effects (than with manufactured drugs). In a lot of cases, we can catch something before it ever becomes noticeable on a blood test, on an MRI or on an X-ray. And certainly acupuncture treatment is far less expensive than surgery. Where Western medicine shines is in the ability to treat acute, life-threatening situations. The drugs are very effective and they work quickly. But for long-term use they end up taking their toll. KAY AMECHE Private nurse, artist, West Hollywood I believe very strongly in alternative healing methods. I believe people shouldn't take medicine. My music teacher became very ill and I told her she was doing something wrong. I said, \"Let me see the medicines that you're taking.\" She was taking about 15 medicines a day. I said, \"Why don't you experiment? Stop taking all of them completely for three weeks.\" She did, and she got better. Too many prescriptions have killed people. People can't put all these chemicals into their body. I find that M.D.'s are too quick to prescribe medicine instead of giving nature a chance. The mind has a great deal to do with it. "}
