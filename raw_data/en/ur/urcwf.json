How Acupuncture Works Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine-based approach to treating a variety of conditions by triggering specific points in the body with very thin needles. These needles are so tiny that they cause little to no discomfort\u2014in fact, people often don't feel them at all. The needles are then activated through gentle and strategic movements of the practitioner's hands or with electrical stimulation. Contemporary research maintains that each needle produces a very small injury at the insertion site, causing the body to recruit healing mechanisms to the area. This involves stimulation of the immune system, promoting circulation to the area, healing, and pain modulation. The Chinese philosophy behind acupuncture centers around the concept of \"Qi\"(pronounced \"chee\"). Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have established an energy flow, called Qi, that runs through the body and is responsible for overall health. Acupuncture helps restore or maintain the flow of your Qi so you can experience good mental and physical health. [Electroacupuncture](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/news/20160607/electroacupuncture-helped-ease-carpal-tunnel-in-study) is a modern variation of acupuncture. It uses electricity to enhance the benefits of this traditional therapeutic treatment. A benefit of using electroacupuncture is that it can cover larger areas of your body than traditional acupuncture. This ability makes this type of acupuncture more accurate than others.

Unlike western medicine that focuses on treating disease, TM looks at your entire well-being and not only how to treat the disease, but how to prevent it. Some practices that TCM uses is acupuncture, cupping, herbs, meditation, moxibustion and tai chi. What is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is a Chinese therapy that includes the insertion of very fine, sterile needles underneath the skin into specific points on the body such as meridians. Meridians are responsible for the circulation of energy. The purpose of acupuncture is to balance one's overall energy and allow our bodies to become stronger and more effective at dealing with illness or other health conditions while also treating both the symptoms and the root causes of the patient's illness. What does it feel like? Acupuncture needles are different from needles used by doctors because they are not designed to cut the skin. They are smooth and rounded, and the needles used at our clinic are sterile, disposable needles that are only used once so there is no risk of infection. Since pain is subjective, everyone has a different experience, but most patients find that the treatments are relaxing and they don't feel the needles going in or they feel a slight pinch that quickly diminishes. What can Acupuncture treat? Acupuncture can treat a variety of both chronic and acute illnesses. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institute of Health (NIH) acknowledge the benefits of acupuncture for pain relief, back and neck pain, digestive disorders, insomnia, anxiety, depression, headaches, fertility, TMJ syndrome, menstrual issues, fibromyalgia, and much more. Medical Acupuncture Western medical acupuncture is very similar to Chinese acupuncture in the sense that it involves the insertion of fine needles, but it uses current knowledge of anatomy, physiology and pathology, and evidence-based medicine. Medical acupuncture has a scientific based behind its method of healing. It's based on the precise stimulation of the nervous system to relive pain. Western medicine tends to be very concrete and logical but TCM is based on balance, harmony, and energy. Cosmetic Acupuncture [Cosmetic Acupuncture](https://renewintegrativehealth.com/cosmetic-acupuncture/#:~:text=Cosmetic%20Acupuncture%20is%20a%20non,years%20off%20of%20your%20face.) is a non-surgical method of reducing the signs of the aging process. Acupuncture techniques as well as a varietyofChinese medical treatments and Chinese herbal supplements are used to erase years off of your face. Based on the differentiated diagnoses of Oriental Medicine, the whole body looks and feels younger by addressing the physical, mental and emotional patterns that cause disease and contribute to the aging process. What's The Difference Between Cosmetic Acupuncture And Botox? Botox cannot treat wrinkles due to aging or sun exposure or reduce the fine lines (only works on dynamic wrinkles - smile lines, frown lines) Risk of paralysis of surrounding muscles & upper eyelid droop Botox only provides temporary results. The more you get, the more you need to achieve same effect Cost is at least $1000.00 every 3-4 months! May not be able to raise eyebrows and have other expressions Long term effects of botox are still unknown Moxibustion [Moxibustion](https://www.healthline.com/health/moxibustion#:~:text=Moxibustion%20is%20a%20type%20of,(energy)%20in%20your%20body.) is a therapy used in traditional Chinese medicine that involves burning herbs called \"moxa\" on or very close to the skin to warm and increase the flow of energy throughout the body via meridians. There are two types of moxibustion: direct and indirect. Ways of indirect moxibustion are burning moxa on top of the acupuncture needle or holding the burning moxa above the skin for several minutes. Moxibustion is often in conjunction with acupuncture in the same setting because the therapies can increase each other's effectiveness when used together. It can be used to treat arthritis, back pain, headaches and migraines, digestive problems, and gynecological and obstetrical conditions. Cupping Cupping is a traditional Chinese medical practice in which a glass cup applies suction to the surface of the body along specific meridians or around the pain area. It draws out pathogenic factors to stimulate the flow of blood at the surface of the body. In some cases, the cup may also be moved while the suction is active. Acupuncturists use Cupping for a variety of conditions such as arthritis, headache, low back pain, painful menstruation, and the common cold. Both of our acupuncturists and chiropractor Dr. Harmony can incorporate cupping into their treatment. Our acupuncturist Tatiana also does a 30-minute cupping and tune off treatment for patients who scared of needles. Electric Acupuncture Electroacupuncture is similar to acupuncture. Electro-acupuncture uses only two needles and it has an added electric current through the needles. The needles are still very thin hair like needles. The electric component can accelerate the healing process of the body and better stimulate the acupoints. The acupuncturist will use an electroacupuncture machine that has adjustable current and voltage settings, with low frequencies. It is low at first and then they may modify it during the treatment. The electric stimulation is not painful, it's a very gentle vibration. Electroacupuncture is very similar to traditional acupuncture in the sense that it also addresses. It treats a variety of illnesses such as chronic pain, spasms, arthritis, neurological diseases, and more. Acupressure Unlike acupuncture that uses tiny needles, acupressure doesn't use any needles, but instead involves the manual pressure by fingers to specific [ac](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acupuncture-point#:~:text=Acupuncture%20points%20are%20anatomically%20defined,reliably%20detected%20with%20electrodermal%20measurements.) [upoints on the body](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acupuncture-point#:~:text=Acupuncture%20points%20are%20anatomically%20defined,reliably%20detected%20with%20electrodermal%20measurements.).

It also helps relieve side effects from [chemotherapy](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033), headaches, menstrual cramps, muscle tension and pain, insomnia, and more. Gua Sha [Gua sha](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-gua-sha#:~:text=Gua%20sha%20is%20a%20traditional,pain%20all%20over%20their%20body.) is a natural ancient Chinese healing technique that involves using a tool to rub or scrape the skin in long strokes to relieve pain and tension. TCM Practitioners generally pair this with Acupuncture and perform on a person's back, buttocks, neck, arms and legs. Sometimes Acupuncturist use a gentler approach on the face. The practitioner will apply massage oil to the skin and start out with mild pressure, and gradually increase based on how much force the patient can handle. Acupuncturist use Gua sha to relieve muscle and joint pain. Gua Sha creates bruises which is a response in the body that may help to break down scar tissue. This Technique is beneficial for people suffering from back pain, neck and shoulder pain, [perimenopausal syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666), and to assist with recovery after exercise. Patients should take it easy for the rest of the day after this treatment. They should not drink any alcohol. The gua sha treatment gets blood and energy flowing again and too much activity may decrease its benefits quicker.
