ARC 3568C ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION [567] Notice of Intended Action Pr oposing rule making r elated to water supply and pr oviding an opportunity for public comment The Environmental Protection Commission hereby proposes to amend Chapter 40, \"Scope of Division\u2014Definitions\u2014Forms\u2014Rules of Practice,\" Chapter 41, \"W ater Supplies,\" Chapter 42, \"Public Notification, Public Education, Consumer Confidence Reports, Reporting, and Record Maintenance,\" Chapter 43, \"W ater Supplies\u2014Design and Operation,\" Chapter Fund,\" Chapter 81, \"Operator Certification: Public W ater Supply Systems and W astewater T reatment Systems,\" and Chapter 83, \"Laboratory Certification,\" Iowa Administrative Code. Legal Authority for Rule Making This rule making is proposed under the authority provided in Iowa Code chapter 272C and sections 455B.105, 455B.1 13, 455B.173, 455B.222 and 455B.299. State or Federal Law Implemented This rule making implements, in whole or in part, Iowa Code chapter 272C and sections 17A.3(1)\"b,\" 455B.1 13 455B.21 1 to 455B.224 and 455B.299. Purpose and Summary The purpose of the proposed rule making is to adopt the federal Groundwater Rule (GWR, November 2006), Lead and Copper Rule - Short-T erm Revisions (LCR-STR, October 2007), and Revised T otal Coliform Rule (R TCR, February 2013). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EP A) also made other changes to existing federal drinking water rules between August 2004 and July 2016, primarily in analytical methods, which are included in this rule making. States are expected to incorporate these federal rule provisions into state program rules in order to maintain primacy in the drinking water program. The proposed amendments, if adopted, will accomplish that end. In addition, other changes to the Department' s public drinking water , operator certification, and environmental laboratory rules are proposed. Proposed changes are summarized below by chapter . Chapter 40: amend definitions for \"sanitary survey\" and \"T en States Standards\"; add new definitions for the following: clean compliance history , Level 1 assessment, Level 2 assessment, sanitary defect, and seasonal system; include the Department' s website address; and update forms. Chapter 41: rescind the existing total coliform rule and replace it with the R TCR; update analytical methods; revise the existing lead and copper rule by adopting the LCR-STR; require use of an analytical method for an or ganic contaminant that meets the method detection limit requirements for compliance samples; include the GWR; and make other minor corrections. Chapter 42: include the public notification, consumer confidence report, lead consumer notice, and lead public education requirements for the GWR, LCR-STR, and R TCR; update the Department' s environmental emer gency reporting hotline telephone number; update the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) 60 certification requirement to allow for use of chemicals that are accredited via third-party conformance with the standard; allow noncommunity IAB 1/17/18 NOTICES 1609 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) systems that only use a cation-exchange softener to have bacterial compliance history reviewed before continuous disinfection is required; require all systems using water to which chlorine has been added to monitor daily in the distribution system to ensure the minimum disinfectant residual concentration is met; require inactivation ratio to be calculated each day the surface water or influenced groundwater treatment plant is in operation and to notify the Department within 24 hours if the ratio is below 1.0; and make other minor corrections. Chapter 43: include the provisions for the GWR, LCR-STR, and R TCR; update the construction standards to the 2012 edition of T en States Standards and 2016 American W ater W orks Standards; require new groundwater sources to be tested for ammonia; add the separation distances for ground heat exchange (GHEX) loop boreholes; update the ANSI/NSF 61 certification requirement to allow for use of drinking water system components that are accredited via third-party conformance with the standard; remove arsenic as an exception from the best available technology listing for inor ganic compounds; require at least 0.5 log inactivation of Giar dia lamblia cysts in treatment of surface or influenced groundwater sources to be from a chemical disinfectant; require notification by the surface water or influenced groundwater system to the Department within 24 hours if the daily total inactivation ratio is below 1.0; add the calibration and verification requirements for turbidity and residual disinfectant monitoring; update analytical methods; include federal language for the Long-T erm 2 Enhanced Surface W ater T reatment Rule for sample collection, analytical methods, and bank filtration credit; add CT virus inactivation tables for groundwater systems; and make other minor changes. Chapter 44: revise the provision relating to allowable costs to be funded through the Drinking W ater State Revolving Fund to allow for funding of the replacement of lead service lines. Chapter 81: add new definitions of \"operation shift\" and \"shift operator\"; correct Iowa Code citations in the definition of \"rural water district\"; allow transient noncommunity systems to be classified as Grade A systems; rescind sunset education credit; rescind oral examination allowance and fee; change reexamination time frame from 180 days to 30 days; remove the description of accommodations for examination; rescind temporary certification; and make other minor changes. Chapter 83: update the \"Manual for Certification of Laboratories Analyzing Environmental Samples for the Iowa DNR\" to 2017; remove reference to \"fecal coliform\" and replace with reference to E. coli when appropriate; rescind an outdated procedure for initial certification of solid waste and contaminated sites program parameters; update the Department' s environmental emer gency hotline telephone number; add credit card fee payment option; include record-keeping requirements for a laboratory auditor; and make other minor changes. These chapters and the amendments to them were reviewed by the water supply technical advisory group at a meeting held on April 28, 2017. The group is comprised of individuals representing a wide variety of water supply stakeholders, including professional drinking water or ganizations, certified operators, certified environmental laboratories, environmental interests, agricultural and business interests, public water supplies, consulting engineers, and other state agencies. Fiscal Impact This rule making has no fiscal impact to the State of Iowa. Jobs Impact After analysis and review of this rule making, no impact on jobs has been found. W aivers There are no specific provisions for waivers in the rules, although there are considerations for system source water , size, and type in GWR and R TCR. There are general authorities to issue waivers for some rules, which are used when appropriate. Any person who believes that the application of the discretionary provisions of this rule making would result in hardship or injustice to that person may petition the Department for a waiver of the discretionary provisions, if any . 1610 NOTICES IAB 1/17/18 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) Public Comment Any interested person may submit written or oral comments concerning this proposed rule making.

The Committee' s meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may be heard as provided in Iowa Code section 17A.8(6). The following rule-making actions are proposed: I TEM 1 . Amend rule 567\u201440.2(455B) , definitions \"Sanitary en States Standards,\" as follows: \" Sanitary survey \" means a review and on-site inspection conducted by the department of the water source, facilities, equipment, operation and maintenance and records of a public water supply system for the purpose of evaluating the adequacy of such source, facilities, equipment, operation and maintenance for producing and distributing safe drinking water and identifying improvements necessary to maintain or improve drinking water quality , pursuant to 567\u2014subrule 43.1(7) . \" T en States Standar ds \" means the \"Recommended Standards for W ater W orks,\" 2007 2012 edition as adopted by the Great Lakes\u2014Upper Mississippi River Board of State and Provincial Public Health and Environmental Managers. IAB 1/17/18 NOTICES 161 1 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) I TEM 2 . Adopt the following new definitions of \"Clean compliance history ,\" \"Level in rule 567\u201440.2(455B) : \" Clean compliance history \" means, for the purposes of 567\u2014paragraph 41.2(1) \"e\" (4)\"2,\" a record of no monitoring violations and no coliform treatment technique trigger exceedances or treatment technique violations under 567\u2014subrule 41.2(1). \" Level 1 assessment \" means an evaluation to identify the possible presence of sanitary defects, defects in distribution system coliform bacteria monitoring practices, and (when possible) the likely reason that the system triggered the assessment. A Level 1 assessment is conducted by the system operator or owner . Minimum elements of the assessment include review and identification of atypical events that could af fect distributed water quality or indicate that distributed water quality was impaired; changes in distribution system maintenance and operation that could af fect distributed water quality (including water storage); source and treatment considerations that bear on distributed water quality , where appropriate (e.g., whether a groundwater system is disinfected); existing water quality monitoring data; and inadequacies in sample sites, sampling protocol, and sample processing. The system owner or operator must conduct the assessment consistent with any department directives that tailor specific assessment elements with respect to the size and type of the system and the size, type, and characteristics of the distribution system. \" Level 2 assessment \" means an evaluation to identify the possible presence of sanitary defects, defects in distribution system coliform bacteria monitoring practices, and (when possible) the likely reason that the system triggered the assessment. A Level 2 assessment provides a more detailed examination of the system (including the system' s monitoring and operational practices) than does a Level 1 assessment through the use of more comprehensive investigation and review of available information, additional internal and external resources, and other relevant practices. A Level 2 assessment is conducted by a department water supply inspector and will typically include the system operator . Minimum elements of the assessment include review and identification of atypical events that could af fect distributed water quality or indicate that distributed water quality was impaired; changes in distribution system maintenance and operation that could af fect distributed water quality (including water storage); source and treatment considerations that bear on distributed water quality , where appropriate (e.g., whether a groundwater system is disinfected); existing water quality monitoring data; and inadequacies in sample sites, sampling protocol, and sample processing. The department may tailor specific assessment elements with respect to the size and type of the system and the size, type and characteristics of the distribution system. The system must comply with any expedited actions or additional actions required by the department in the case of an E. coli MCL violation. \" Sanitary defect \" means a defect that could provide a pathway of entry for microbial contamination into the distribution system or that is indicative of a failure or imminent failure in a barrier that is already in place. \" Seasonal system \" means a noncommunity water system that is not operated as a public water system on a year -round basis and starts up and shuts down at the beginning and end of each operating season.

Rescind subrule 41.2(1) and adopt the following new subrule in lieu thereof: 41.2 (1) Coliform bacteria and E. coli . The provisions of this subrule include both maximum contaminant level and treatment technique requirements. The provisions of this subrule apply to all public water systems. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements in this subrule is a violation of the national primary drinking water regulations. a. Maximum contaminant level. A public water system must determine compliance with the MCL for E. coli for each month in which the system is required to monitor for total coliforms. A system is in compliance with the MCL for E. coli for samples taken under this subrule unless any of the following conditions occur . For purposes of the public notification requirements in 567\u201442.1(455B), violation of the MCL may pose an acute risk to health. (1) E. coli -positive repeat sample. The system has an E. coli -positive repeat sample following a total coliform-positive routine sample. (2) E. coli -positive routine sample. The system has a total coliform-positive repeat sample following an E. coli -positive routine sample. (3) Failure to collect all required repeat samples following E. coli -positive routine samples. The system fails to take all required repeat samples following an E. coli -positive routine sample. (4) Failure to test for E. coli on any total coliform-positive repeat sample. The system fails to test for E. coli when any repeat sample tests positive for total coliform. b. Analytical methodology . (1) Sample volume. The standard sample volume required for analysis is 100 mL, regardless of the analytical method used. (2) Presence/absence required. Only the presence or absence of total coliforms and E. coli is required to be determined in any compliance sample; a determination of density is acceptable but is not required. (3) Holding time and temperature. The time from sample collection to initiation of test medium incubation may not exceed 30 hours. Systems are encouraged but not required to hold samples below 10\u00b0 C during transit. (4) Dechlorinating agent required for chlorinated water . If water having a residual chlorine (measured as free, combined, or total chlorine) is to be analyzed, suf ficient sodium thiosulfate (Na 2 S 2 O 3 ) must be added to the sample bottle before sterilization to neutralize any residual chlorine in IAB 1/17/18 NOTICES 1613 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) the water sample. Dechlorination procedures are addressed in Section 9060A.2 of Standard Methods for the Examination of W ater and W astewater (20th and 21st editions).

(7) Laboratory certification. Systems must have all compliance samples required under this subrule analyzed by a laboratory certified by the department in accordance with 567\u2014Chapter 83 to analyze drinking water samples. The laboratory used by the system must be certified for each method and associated contaminant used for compliance monitoring analyses under this subrule. c. Sampling plan. (1) W ritten sampling plan required. Systems must collect total coliform samples according to the written sampling plan. 1. Systems must develop a written sampling plan that identifies sample locations and a sample collection schedule that are representative of water throughout the distribution system. Major elements of the plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following: Map of the distribution system served by the system; List of routine compliance sample locations for each sample period; List of repeat compliance sample locations for each routine compliance sample location; Any other sample locations necessary to meet the requirements of this subrule; Sample collection schedule; Proper sampling technique instructions; Log of samples taken; and For groundwater systems subject to 567\u201441.7(455B), triggered source water monitoring plan. 2. The system shall review the sampling plan every two years and update it as needed and shall retain the sampling plan on file at the facility . The plan must be made available to the department upon request and for review during sanitary surveys and must be revised by the system at the direction of the department. 3. Monitoring under this subrule may take place at a customer ' s premises, dedicated sampling station, or other designated compliance sampling location. (2) Sampling schedule. Systems must collect routine samples at regular time intervals throughout the month. Systems that use only groundwater and serve 4,900 or fewer people, or regional water systems that use only groundwater and serve less than 121 miles of pipe, may collect all required routine samples on a single day if the samples are taken from dif ferent sites. (3) Minimum number of required routine samples. Systems must take at least the minimum number of required routine samples even if the system has had an E. coli MCL violation or has exceeded the coliform treatment technique triggers in 41.2(1) \"l.\" Such samples must be designated as \"routine\" when submitted to the laboratory . (4) Additional compliance monitoring samples. A system may conduct more compliance monitoring than is required to investigate potential problems in the distribution system and may use monitoring as a tool to assist in uncovering problems. A system may take more than the minimum number of required routine samples and must include the results when calculating whether the coliform treatment technique trigger in 41.2(1) \"l\" (1)\"1\" and \"2\" has been exceeded only if the samples are taken in accordance with the existing sampling plan and are representative of water throughout the distribution system. Such samples must be designated as \"routine\" when submitted to the laboratory . (5) Repeat samples. Systems must identify repeat monitoring locations in the sampling plan. Repeat samples must be analyzed at the same laboratory as the corresponding original routine sample(s), unless written approval for use of a dif ferent laboratory is granted by the department. The system must collect at least one repeat sample from the sampling tap where the original routine total IAB 1/17/18 NOTICES 1617 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) coliform-positive sample was taken, at least one repeat sample at a tap within five service connections upstream of the original sample location, and at least one repeat sample at a tap within five service connections downstream of the original sample location. Such samples must be designated as \"repeat\" when submitted to the laboratory . 1. If the sampling location of a total coliform-positive sample is at or within one service connection from the end of the distribution system, the system must still take all required repeat samples. However , the department may allow an alternative sampling location in lieu of one of the upstream or downstream sampling locations. 2. A groundwater system with two or more wells that is required to conduct triggered source water monitoring under subrule 41.7(3) must collect groundwater source sample(s) in addition to the required repeat samples. 3. A groundwater system with a single well that is required to conduct triggered source water monitoring may , with written department approval, collect one of its required repeat samples at the triggered source water sample monitoring location. The system must demonstrate to the department' s satisfaction that the sampling plan remains representative of water quality in the distribution system. If approved, the sample result may be used to meet the requirements of subrule 41.7(3) and this subrule. If a repeat sample taken at the triggered source water monitoring location is E. coli -positive, the system has violated the E. coli MCL, and must also comply with the requirements for additional source water samples under 41.7(3) \"a\" (3). 4. The department may review , revise, and approve, as appropriate, repeat sampling proposed by the system under 41.2(1) \"c\" (5). The system must demonstrate that the sampling plan remains representative of the water quality in the distribution system. (6) Special purpose samples. Special purpose samples, such as those taken to determine whether disinfection practices are suf ficient following pipe placement, replacement, or repair , must not be used to determine whether the coliform treatment technique trigger has been exceeded. Repeat samples are not considered special purpose samples and must be used to determine whether the coliform treatment technique trigger has been exceeded. Such samples must be designated as \"special\" when submitted to the laboratory and cannot be used for compliance. (7) Residual disinfectant measurement. Any system adding a chemical disinfectant to the water must meet the requirements specified in 567\u2014subparagraph 42.4(3) \"b\" (1). The minimum required residual disinfectant measurements are as follows, unless otherwise directed by the department in writing: 1. Groundwater systems. A system that uses only groundwater and adds a chemical disinfectant or provides water that contains a disinfectant must measure and record the free and total chlorine residual disinfectant concentration at least at the same points in the distribution system and at the same time as routine and repeat total coliform bacteria samples are collected, as specified in 41.2(1) \"e\" through 41.2(1) \"j.\" The system shall report the residual disinfectant concentration to the laboratory with the bacteria sample and comply with the applicable reporting requirements of 567\u2014subrule 42.4(3). 2. Surface water and influenced groundwater systems. Any surface water or IGW PWS must meet the requirements for minimum residual disinfectant entering the distribution system pursuant to 567\u2014paragraph 43.5(4) \"b\" (2)\"1\"; and A system that uses surface water or IGW must comply with the requirements specified in 567\u2014paragraph 43.5(4) \"b\" (2)\"2\" for daily distribution system residual disinfectant monitoring. The system must measure and record the free and total chlorine residual disinfectant concentration at least at the same points in the distribution system and at the same time as routine and repeat total coliform bacteria samples are collected, as specified in 41.2(1) \"e\" through 41.2(1) \"j.\" The residual disinfectant measurements required as a part of this subrule may be used to satisfy the requirement in 567\u2014paragraph 43.5(4) \"b\" (2)\"2\" on the day(s) when a routine or repeat total coliform bacteria sample(s) is collected, in lieu of separate samples. The system shall report the residual disinfectant concentration to the laboratory with the bacteria sample and comply with the applicable reporting requirements of 567\u2014subrule 42.4(3). d. Invalidation of total coliform samples. A total coliform-positive sample invalidated under this paragraph does not count toward meeting the minimum monitoring requirements of this subrule. 1618 NOTICES IAB 1/17/18 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) (1) The department may invalidate a total coliform-positive sample only if the following conditions are met: 1. The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused the total coliform-positive result. 2. The department, on the basis of the results of the required repeat samples, determines that the total coliform-positive sample resulted from a domestic or other non-distribution system plumbing problem. \"Domestic or other non-distribution system plumbing problem\" means a coliform contamination problem in a public water system with more than one service connection that is limited to the specific service connection from which the coliform-positive sample was taken. The department cannot invalidate a sample on the basis of repeat sample results unless all repeat samples collected at the same tap as the original total coliform-positive sample are also total coliform-positive and all repeat samples collected at a location other than the original tap are total coliform-negative. The department cannot invalidate a total coliform-positive sample on the basis of repeat samples if all the repeat samples are total coliform-negative or if the system has only one service connection. 3. The department has substantial grounds to believe that the total coliform-positive result is due to a circumstance or condition that does not reflect water quality in the distribution system. The system must still collect all repeat samples required under 41.2(1) \"j\" and use them to determine whether a coliform treatment technique trigger in 41.2(1) \"l\" has been exceeded. The decision and supporting rationale for invalidating a total coliform-positive sample under 41.2(1) \"d\" (1) must be documented in writing, and approved and signed by the supervisor of the water supply operations section or water supply engineering section and the department of ficial who recommended the decision. The department must make this document available to EP A and the public. The written documentation must state the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample and what action the system has taken, or will take, to correct this problem. The department may not invalidate a total coliform-positive sample solely on the grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform-negative or because of poor sampling technique. (2) Laboratory invalidation. A laboratory must invalidate a total coliform sample (unless total coliforms are detected, in which case the sample is valid) if the sample produces a turbid culture in the absence of gas production using an analytical method where gas formation is examined (e.g., the multiple-tube fermentation technique), produces a turbid culture in the absence of an acid reaction in the presence-absence (P-A) coliform test, or exhibits confluent growth or produces colonies too numerous to count with an analytical method using a membrane filter (e.g., membrane filter technique). If a laboratory invalidates a sample because of such interference, the system must collect another sample from the same location as that of the original sample within 24 hours of being notified of the interference problem and must have the sample analyzed for the presence of total coliforms. The system must continue to resample within 24 hours and have the samples analyzed until a valid result is obtained. The department may waive the 24-hour time limit on a case-by-case basis. e. Routine monitoring for specific gr oundwater noncommunity water systems serving 1,000 or fewer people. This paragraph applies to noncommunity water systems using only groundwater (not IGW) as a source and serving 1,000 or fewer people. Groundwater noncommunity water systems that serve schools, preschools, and child care facilities, and all public water systems owned or managed by state agencies, such as parks and rest areas, must monitor at the same frequency as a like-sized community water system, in accordance with 41.2(1) \"f,\" 41.2(1) \"g,\" or 41.2(1) \"h.\" (1) total coliform-positive sample taken under 41.2(1) \"e,\" systems must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and E. coli analytical requirements in 41.2(1) \"j.\" Once all monitoring required by 41.2(1) \"e\" and 41.2(1) \"j\" for a calendar month has been completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in 41.2(1) \"l\" have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as required by 41.2(1) \"l.\" (2) Monitoring frequency for total coliforms. Systems must monitor each calendar quarter that the system provides water to the public, with the following exceptions: IAB 1/17/18 NOTICES 1619 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) 1. A system on quarterly monitoring that experiences any of the following events must begin monthly monitoring in the month following the event. The system must continue on monthly monitoring until the system meets the requirements for returning to quarterly monitoring. The system has an E. coli MCL violation. The system triggers one Level 2 assessment under the provisions of 41.2(1) \"l\" in a rolling 12-month period. The system triggers two Level 1 assessments under the provisions of 41.2(1) \"l\" in a rolling 12-month period. The system has a coliform treatment technique violation. The system has two coliform monitoring violations in a rolling 12-month period. The system has one monitoring coliform violation and one Level 1 assessment under the provisions of 41.2(1) \"l\" in a rolling 12-month period. 2. A system on monthly monitoring for reasons other than those identified in 41.2(1) \"e\" (2)\"1\" is not considered to be on increased monitoring for the purposes of 41.2(1). 3. Seasonal systems must sample each month in which they are in operation. All seasonal systems must also demonstrate completion of a department-approved start-up procedure before serving water to the public, which includes a requirement for a coliform-negative start-up sample. (3) Evaluation of sampling frequency during a sanitary survey . During each sanitary survey , the department must evaluate the status of the system including the distribution system, to determine whether the system is on an appropriate monitoring schedule. The department may modify the system' s monitoring schedule, as necessary , or may allow the system to stay on its existing monitoring schedule, consistent with the provisions of 41.2(1) \"e.\" (4) Requirements for returning from monthly to quarterly sampling frequency for nonseasonal noncommunity systems. The department may reduce the monitoring frequency for a nonseasonal noncommunity system on monthly monitoring triggered under 41.2(1) \"e\" (2)\"1\" to quarterly monitoring if the system meets the following criteria. For the purposes of 41.2(1) \"e\" (4), \"protected water source\" means the well meets separation distances from sources of microbial contamination pursuant to 567\u2014subrule 43.3(7), T able A; or the system has 4-log virus inactivation treatment that is approved by the department and is in continuous usage. 1. W ithin the previous 12 months, the system must have a completed sanitary survey or voluntary Level 2 assessment, be free of sanitary defects, and have a protected water source; 2. The system must have a clean compliance history for a minimum of the previous 12 months; and 3. The department must review the approved sampling plan, which must designate the time period(s) for monitoring based on site-specific considerations (e.g., during periods of highest demand or highest vulnerability to contamination). The system must collect compliance samples during these time periods. (5) Additional routine monitoring for systems on quarterly sampling in the month following a total coliform-positive routine sample. Systems collecting samples on a quarterly frequency must conduct additional routine monitoring the month following one or more total coliform-positive samples (with or without a Level 1 treatment technique trigger). Systems must collect at least three routine samples during the next month. Systems may either collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month or may collect all required routine samples on a single day if samples are taken from dif ferent sites. Systems must use the results of additional routine samples in coliform treatment technique trigger calculations under 41.2(1) \"l.\" f. Routine monitoring for gr oundwater community water systems serving 1,000 or fewer people. This paragraph applies to community water systems using only groundwater (not IGW) as a source and serving 1,000 or fewer people. (1) General. Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under 41.2(1) \"f,\" systems must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and E. coli analytical requirements in 41.2(1) \"j.\" Once all monitoring required by 41.2(1) \"f\" and 41.2(1) \"j\" for a calendar month has been completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in 41.2(1) \"l\" have 1620 NOTICES IAB 1/17/18 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as required by 41.2(1) \"l.\" (2) Monitoring frequency for total coliforms. The routine monitoring frequency for total coliforms is one sample per month. g. Routine monitoring r equir ements for SW/IGW public water systems serving 1,000 or fewer people. This paragraph applies to all public water supply systems serving 1,000 or fewer people that use surface water/influenced groundwater sources, including consecutive systems. (1) General. Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under 41.2(1) \"g,\" systems must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and E. coli analytical requirements in 41.2(1) \"j.\" Once all monitoring required by 41.2(1) \"g\" and 41.2(1) \"j\" for a calendar month has been completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in 41.2(1) \"l\" have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as required by 41.2(1) \"l.\" (2) Monitoring frequency for total coliforms. The routine monitoring frequency for total coliforms is one sample per month. Systems may not reduce monitoring frequency . (3) Seasonal systems must sample each month in which they are in operation, and the monitoring frequency cannot be reduced. All seasonal systems must also demonstrate completion of a department-approved start-up procedure before serving water to the public, which includes a requirement for a coliform-negative start-up sample. h. Routine monitoring r equir ements for public water systems serving mor e than 1,000 people. The provisions of this paragraph apply to all public water systems serving more than 1,000 people except regional water systems. The requirements for regional water systems are listed in 41.2(1) \"i.\" (1) General. Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under 41.2(1) \"h,\" systems must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and E. coli analytical requirements in 41.2(1) \"j.\" Once all monitoring required by 41.2(1) \"h\" and 41.2(1) \"l\" for a calendar month has been completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in 41.2(1) \"l\" have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as required by 41.2(1) \"l.\" (2) Monitoring frequency for total coliforms. The routine monitoring frequency for total coliforms is based upon the population served by the system, as follows: Population Served Minimum Number of Routine Samples per Month 1,001 to 2,500 2 2,501 to 3,300 3 3,301 to 4,100 4 4,101 to 4,900 5 4,901 to 5,800 6 5,801 to 6,700 7 6,701 to 7,600 8 7,601 to 8,500 9 8,501 to 12,900 10 12,901 to 17,200 15 17,201 to 21,500 20 21,501 to 25,000 25 25,001 to 33,000 30 33,001 to 41,000 40 41,001 to 50,000 50 50,001 to 59,000 60 IAB 1/17/18 NOTICES 1621 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) Population Served Minimum Number of Routine Samples per Month 59,001 to 70,000 70 70,001 to 83,000 80 83,001 to 96,000 90 96,001 to 130,000 100 130,001 to 220,000 120 220,001 to 320,000 150 320,001 to 450,000 180 450,001 to 600,000 210 600,001 to 780,000 240 780,001 to 970,000 270 970,001 to 1,230,000 300 (3) Seasonal systems must sample each month in which they are in operation, and the monitoring frequency cannot be reduced. All seasonal systems must also demonstrate completion of a department-approved start-up procedure before serving water to the public, which includes a requirement for a coliform-negative start-up sample. (4) Reduced monitoring. Community systems may not reduce the number of required routine samples. (5) Increased monitoring. If the department, on the basis of a sanitary survey or monitoring results history , determines that some greater frequency of monitoring is more appropriate, that frequency shall be the frequency required under these rules. The increased frequency shall be confirmed or changed on the basis of subsequent surveys. i. Routine monitoring r equir ements for r egional public water systems. The provisions of 41.2(1) \"i\" apply to all regional water systems. The supplier of water for a regional water system as defined in 567\u201440.2(455B) shall sample for coliform bacteria at a frequency based upon the miles of pipe in its distribution system. (1) General. Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under 41.2(1) \"i,\" systems must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and E. coli analytical requirements in 41.2(1) \"j.\" Once all monitoring required by 41.2(1) \"i\" and 41.2(1) \"j\" for a calendar month has been completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in 41.2(1) \"l\" have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as required by 41.2(1) \"l.\" (2) Monitoring frequency for total coliforms. The routine monitoring frequency for total coliforms is based upon the miles of pipe in the system' s distribution system, as indicated in the following chart. In no case shall the sampling frequency for a regional water system be less than as set forth in 41.2(1) \"h\" based upon the population equivalent served. The following chart represents sampling frequency per miles of pipe in the distribution system and is determined by calculating one-half the square root of the miles of pipe. 1622 NOTICES IAB 1/17/18 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) Miles of Pipe Minimum Number of Routine Samples per Month 0 - 9 1 10 - 25 2 26 - 49 3 50 - 81 4 82 - 121 5 122 - 169 6 170 - 225 7 226 - 289 8 290 - 361 9 362 - 441 10 442 - 529 1 1 530 - 625 12 626 - 729 13 730 - 841 14 842 - 961 15 962 - 1,089 16 1,090 - 1,225 17 1,226 - 2,401 39 - 40 6,562 and greater 41 IAB 1/17/18 NOTICES 1623 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) (3) Reduced monitoring. Regional water systems may not reduce the number of required routine samples. (4) Increased monitoring. If the department, on the basis of a sanitary survey or monitoring results history , determines that some greater frequency of monitoring is more appropriate, that frequency shall be the frequency required under these rules. The increased frequency shall be confirmed or changed on the basis of subsequent surveys. j. Repeat monitoring. If a routine sample taken under 41.2(1) \"e\" through 41.2(1) \"i\" is total coliform-positive, the system must collect a set of repeat samples. The department cannot waive the requirement for a system to collect repeat samples. (1) The system must collect no fewer than three repeat samples for each total coliform-positive routine sample found. (2) The system must collect the repeat samples within 24 hours of being notified of the positive routine sample result. The department may extend the 24-hour limit on a case-by-case basis if the system has a logistical problem in collecting the repeat samples within 24 hours that is beyond its control. In the case of an extension, the department must specify how much time the system has to collect the repeat samples. (3) The system must collect all repeat samples on the same day , except that the department may allow a system with a single service connection to collect the required set of repeat samples over a three-day period. \"System with a single service connection\" means a system which supplies drinking water to consumers through a single service line. (4) The system must collect an additional set of repeat samples in the manner specified in 41.2(1) \"j\" (1) to (3) if one or more repeat samples in the current set of repeat samples is total coliform-positive. The system must collect the additional set of repeat samples within 24 hours of being notified of the positive result, unless the department extends the limit as provided in 41.2(1) \"j\" (2). The system must continue to collect additional sets of repeat samples until either total coliforms are not detected in one complete set of repeat samples or the system determines that a coliform treatment technique trigger specified in 41.2(1) \"l\" has been exceeded as a result of a total coliform-positive repeat sample and notifies the department. If a trigger identified in 41.2(1) \"l\" is exceeded as a result of a total coliform-positive routine sample, systems are required to conduct only one round of repeat monitoring for each total coliform-positive routine sample. (5) Results of all routine and repeat samples taken under 41.2(1) \"e\" through 41.2(1) \"i\" that are not invalidated by the department must be used to determine whether a coliform treatment technique trigger specified in 41.2(1) \"l\" has been exceeded. k. E. coli testing r equir ements. (1) If any routine or repeat sample is total coliform-positive, the system must analyze that total coliform-positive culture medium to determine the presence of E. coli . If E. coli are present, the system must notify the department by the end of the same day when the system is notified of the test result. If the notification is outside of the department' s routine of fice hours, the system shall call the department' s Environmental Emer gency Reporting Hotline at (515)725-8694. (2) The department has the discretion to allow a system, on a case-by-case basis, to for go E. coli testing on a total coliform-positive sample if that system assumes that the total coliform-positive sample is E. coli -positive. Accordingly , the system must notify the department as specified in 41.2(1) \"k\" (1), and the provisions of 41.2(1) \"a\" apply . l. Coliform tr eatment technique triggers. Systems must conduct assessments in accordance with 41.2(1) \"m\" after exceeding any treatment technique trigger . (1) Level 1 treatment technique triggers. 1. For systems taking 40 or more samples per month, the system exceeds 5.0 percent total coliform-positive samples for the month. 2. For systems taking fewer than 40 samples per month, the system has two or more total coliform-positive samples in the same month. 3. The system fails to take every required repeat sample after any single total coliform-positive sample. 1624 NOTICES IAB 1/17/18 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) (2) Level 2 treatment technique triggers. 1. An E. coli MCL violation, as specified in 41.2(1) \"p\" (1). 2. A second Level 1 trigger as defined in 41.2(1) \"l\" (1) within a rolling 12-month period, unless the department has determined a likely reason that the samples that caused the first Level 1 treatment technique trigger were total coliform-positive and has established that the system has corrected the problem. m. Assessment r equir ements. Systems must ensure that Level 1 and 2 assessments are conducted in order to identify the possible presence of sanitary defects and defects in distribution system coliform monitoring practices. Level 1 assessments may be conducted by the system owner or operator . Level 2 assessments must be conducted by the department with the assistance of the system owner or operator . (1) General. When conducting assessments, systems must ensure that the assessor evaluates minimum elements that include review and identification of inadequacies in sample sites; sampling protocol; sample processing; atypical events that could af fect distributed water quality or indicate that distributed water quality was impaired; changes in distribution system maintenance and operation that could af fect distributed water quality (including water storage); source and treatment considerations that bear on distributed water quality , where appropriate (e.g., small groundwater systems); and existing water quality monitoring data. The system must conduct the assessment consistent with any department directives that tailor specific assessment elements with respect to the size and type of the system, and the size type, and characteristics of the distribution system. (2) Level 1 assessment. A system must conduct a Level 1 assessment consistent with the department requirements if the system exceeds one of the treatment technique triggers in 41.2(1) \"l\" (1). 1. The system must complete the Level 1 assessment as soon as practical after any trigger in 41.2(1) \"l\" (1). In the completed assessment form, the system must describe sanitary defects detected, corrective actions completed, and a proposed timetable for any corrective actions not already completed. The system may also note on the assessment form that no sanitary defects were identified. The system must submit the completed Level 1 assessment form to the department within 30 days after the system learns that it has exceeded a trigger . 2. If the department reviews the completed Level 1 assessment and determines that the assessment is not suf ficient (including any proposed timetable for any corrective actions not already completed), the department must consult with the system. If the department requires revisions after consultation, the system must submit a revised assessment form to the department on an agreed-upon schedule not to exceed 30 days from the date of the consultation. 3. Upon completion and submission of the assessment form by the system, the department must determine if the system has identified the likely cause for the Level 1 trigger and, if so, establish that the system has corrected the problem or has included a schedule acceptable to the department for correction of the problem. (3) Level 2 assessment. A system must ensure that a Level 2 assessment is conducted if the system exceeds one of the treatment technique triggers in 41.2(1) \"l\" (2). The system must comply with any expedited actions or additional actions required by the department in the case of an E. coli MCL violation. 1. The system must ensure that a Level 2 assessment is completed by the department as soon as practical after any trigger in 41.2(1) \"l\" (2). The system must submit a completed Level 2 assessment form to the department within 30 days after the system learns that it has exceeded a trigger . The assessment form must contain a description of the sanitary defects detected, corrective actions completed, and a proposed timetable for any corrective actions not already completed. It may also be noted on the assessment form that no sanitary defects were identified. 2. If the department reviews the completed Level 2 assessment and determines that the assessment is not suf ficient (including any proposed timetable for any corrective actions not already completed), the department must consult with the system. If the department requires revisions after consultation, the system must submit a revised assessment form to the department on an agreed-upon schedule not to exceed 30 days. 3. Upon completion and submission of the assessment form by the system, the department must determine if the system has identified the likely cause for the Level 2 trigger and determine whether the IAB 1/17/18 NOTICES 1625 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) system has corrected the problem or has included a schedule acceptable to the department for correction of the problem. (4) Corrective actions. A system must correct sanitary defects found through either a Level 1 or 2 assessment conducted under 41.2(1) \"l.\" For corrections not completed by the time of submission of the assessment form, the system must complete the corrective action(s) in compliance with a timetable approved by the department in consultation with the system. The system must notify the department when each scheduled corrective action is completed. (5) Consultation. At any time during the assessment or corrective actions phase, either the water system or the department may request a consultation with the other party to determine the appropriate actions to be taken. The system may consult with the department on all relevant information that may impact on its ability to comply with a requirement of this subrule, including the method of accomplishment, an appropriate time frame, and other relevant information. n. Reporting r equir ements. (1) E. coli . 1. The system must notify the department by the end of the same day when the system learns of an E. coli -positive violation. If the notification is outside of the department' s routine of fice hours, the system shall call the department' s Environmental Emer gency Reporting Hotline at (515)725-8694. 2. The system must notify the department by the end of the same day when the system learns of the E. coli -positive routine sample. If the notification is outside of the department' s routine of fice hours, the system shall call the department' s Environmental Emer gency Reporting Hotline at (515)725-8694. (2) A system that has violated the treatment technique for coliforms in 41.2(1) \"l\" must report the violation to the department no later than the end of the next business day after it learns of the violation, and must notify the public in accordance with rule 567\u201442.1(455B). (3) A system required to conduct an assessment under the provisions of 41.2(1) \"l\" must submit the assessment report within 30 days. The system must notify the department in accordance with 41.2(1) \"m\" (4) when each scheduled corrective action is completed for any corrections that were not completed by the time of submission of the assessment form. (4) A system that has failed to comply with a coliform monitoring requirement must report the monitoring violation to the department within 10 days after the system discovers the violation, and must notify the public in accordance with rule 567\u201442.1(455B). (5) A seasonal system must certify , prior to serving water to the public, that it has complied with the department-approved start-up procedure. o. Recor d-keeping r 42.5(1) \"j.\" p. V iolations. (1) E. coli MCL violation. A system is in violation of the MCL for E. coli when any of the following occurs, and must conduct public notice in accordance with rule 567\u201442.1(455B): 1.

The requirements of this rule constitute national primary drinking water regulations. b. Applicability . This rule applies to all public water systems that use groundwater except that it does not apply to public water systems that combine all of their groundwater with surface water or with influenced groundwater prior to treatment under 567\u201443.5(455B). For the purposes of this 1650 NOTICES IAB 1/17/18 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) rule, \"groundwater system\" is defined as any public water system meeting this applicability statement, including consecutive systems receiving finished groundwater . For the purposes of this rule, \"4-log treatment of viruses\" means treatment that includes inactivation, removal, or a department-approved combination of inactivation and removal before or at the first customer of 4-log (99.99%) of viruses. c. General r equir ements. Systems subject to this rule must comply with the following requirements: (1) Sanitary survey information requirements for all groundwater systems as described in 41.7(2). (2) Microbial source water monitoring requirements for groundwater systems that do not treat all of their groundwater to at least 99.99 percent (4-log) treatment of viruses, using inactivation, removal, or a department-approved combination of inactivation and removal before or at the first customer , as described in 41.7(3). (3) T reatment technique requirements, as described in 41.7(4), that apply to groundwater systems that have fecally contaminated source waters, as determined by source water monitoring conducted under 41.7(3), or that have significant deficiencies that are identified by the department. A groundwater system with fecally contaminated source water or with significant deficiencies subject to the treatment technique requirements of this rule must implement one or more of the following corrective action options: 1. Correct all significant deficiencies; 2. Provide an alternate source of water; 3. Eliminate the source of contamination; or 4. Provide treatment that reliably achieves at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a department-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer . (4) Groundwater systems that provide at least 4-log treatment of viruses are required to conduct compliance monitoring to demonstrate treatment ef fectiveness, as described in 41.7(4). (5) If requested by the department, groundwater systems must provide the department with any existing information that will enable the department to perform a hydrogeologic sensitivity assessment. For the purposes of this rule, \"hydrogeologic sensitivity assessment\" is a determination of whether groundwater systems obtain water from hydrogeologically sensitive settings. (6) Certified laboratory requirements. Analyses under this rule shall only be conducted by laboratories that have been certified by the department and are in compliance with the requirements of 567\u2014Chapter 83. 41.7 (2) Sanitary surveys for gr oundwater systems. For the purposes of this rule, a \"sanitary survey ,\" as conducted by the department in accordance with 567\u2014subrule 43.1(7), includes but is not limited to the following: an on-site review of the water sources (identifying sources of contamination using results of source water assessments or other relevant information where available), facilities, equipment, operation, maintenance, and monitoring compliance of a public water system to evaluate the adequacy of the system, its sources and operations and the distribution of safe drinking water . 41.7 (3) Gr oundwater sour ce micr obial monitoring and analytical methods. A groundwater system that has a department-approved 4-log treatment process for viruses and is fulfilling the requirements of 41.7(4) \"b\" is not required to conduct the triggered source water monitoring under 41.7(3) \"a.\" a. T rigger ed sour ce water monitoring. (1) General requirements. A groundwater system must conduct triggered source water monitoring if the conditions identified as follows exist: 1. The system does not provide at least 4-log treatment of viruses for each groundwater source; and 2. The system is notified that a sample collected under 41.2(1) \"e\" through 41.2(1) \"i\" is total coliform-positive, and the sample is not invalidated under 41.2(1) \"d.\" (2) Sampling requirements. A groundwater system must collect at least one groundwater source sample from each groundwater source in use at the time the total coliform-positive sample was collected under 41.2(1) \"e\" through 41.2(1) \"i\" that could have reasonably contributed to the positive sample. The source sample must be collected within 24 hours of when the system is notified of the total coliform-positive sample. IAB 1/17/18 NOTICES 1651 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) 1. The department may extend the 24-hour time limit on a case-by-case basis if the system cannot collect the groundwater source water sample within 24 hours due to circumstances beyond the system' s control. In the case of an extension, the department must specify how much time the system has to collect the sample. 2. A groundwater system serving 1,000 or fewer people may use a repeat sample collected from a groundwater source to meet both the requirements of 41.2(1) \"j\" and to satisfy the monitoring requirements of 41.7(3) \"a\" if: The department approves the use of E. coli as the fecal indicator , The system only has one groundwater source required to be sampled, The system has no treatment, and Should the source water sample be E. coli -positive, the system would incur an acute coliform bacteria maximum contaminant level violation, must comply with T ier 1 public notification requirements, and must also comply with the additional sample monitoring in 41.7(3) \"a\" (3). (3) Additional samples required. Unless the department requires corrective action for a valid triggered source water sample that tested positive for the fecal indicator , the system must collect five additional source water samples from that same source within 24 hours of being notified of the fecal indicator -positive sample result. (4) Further requirements for consecutive and wholesale systems. 1. In addition to the other requirements in 41.7(3) \"a,\" a consecutive groundwater system that has a total coliform-positive sample collected under 41.2(1) \"f\" through 41.2(1) \"i\" must notify the wholesale system(s) within 24 hours of being notified of the total coliform-positive sample. 2. In addition to the other requirements in 41.7(3) \"a,\" a wholesale groundwater system that does not provide the 4-log treatment of viruses as described in 41.7(3) must comply with the following: A wholesale groundwater system that receives notice from a consecutive system it serves that a sample collected under 41.2(1) \"f\" through 41.2(1) \"i\" is total coliform-positive must, within 24 hours of being notified, collect triggered sample(s) from its groundwater source(s) under 41.7(3) \"a\" (2) and analyze the sample(s) for a fecal indicator . If the triggered source sample(s) is fecal indicator -positive, the wholesale groundwater system must notify all consecutive systems served by that groundwater source of the fecal indicator -positive result within 24 hours of being notified of the result and must collect the required additional five samples from the source within 24 hours under 41.7(3) \"a\" (3). (5) Exceptions to the triggered source water monitoring requirements. A groundwater system is not required to comply with the source water monitoring requirements of 41.7(3) \"a\" if either of the following conditions exists: 1. The department determines and documents in writing that the total coliform-positive sample collected under 41.2(1) \"e\" through 41.2(1) \"i\" is caused by a distribution system deficiency; or 2. The total coliform-positive sample collected under 41.2(1) \"e\" through 41.2(1) \"i\" is collected at a location that meets department criteria for distribution system conditions that will cause total coliform-positive samples. b. Assessment sour ce water monitoring. If directed by the department, groundwater systems must conduct assessment source water monitoring that meets department-determined requirements for such monitoring. A groundwater system conducting assessment source water monitoring may use a triggered source water sample collected under 41.7(3) \"a\" (2) to meet the requirements of this paragraph. Department-determined assessment source water monitoring requirements may include: (1) Collection of a total of 12 groundwater source samples that represent each month the system provides groundwater to the public; (2) Collection of samples from each well unless the system obtains written department approval to conduct monitoring at one or more wells within the groundwater system that are representative of multiple wells used by that system and that draw water from the same hydrogeologic setting; (3) Collection of a standard sample volume of at least 100 mL for fecal indicator analysis regardless of technical indicator or analytical method used; 1652 NOTICES IAB 1/17/18 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) (4) Analysis of all groundwater source samples using one of the analytical methods listed in 41.7(3) \"c\" for the presence of E. coli , enterococci, or coliphage; (5) Collection of groundwater source samples at a location before any treatment of the groundwater source unless the department approves a sampling location after treatment; and (6) Collection of groundwater source samples at the well itself unless the system' s configuration does not allow for sampling at the well itself and the department approves an alternate sampling location that is representative of the water quality of that well. c. Analytical methods. (1) A groundwater system subject to the source water monitoring requirements of this rule must collect a standard sample volume of at least 100 mL for fecal indicator analysis regardless of the fecal indicator or analytical method used. (2) A groundwater system must analyze all groundwater source samples collected under 567\u201441.7(455B) using one of the analytical methods in the following table for the presence of E. coli , enterococci, or coliphage.

Invalidation of a fecal indicator -positive gr oundwater sour ce sample. (1) A groundwater system may obtain invalidation from the department of a fecal indicator -positive groundwater source sample collected under 41.7(3) \"a\" only under these conditions: 1. The system provides the department with written notice from the laboratory that improper sample analysis occurred; or 2. The department determines and documents in writing that there is substantial evidence that a fecal indicator -positive groundwater source sample is not related to source water quality . (2) If the department invalidates a fecal indicator -positive groundwater source sample, the system must collect another source water sample under 41.7(3) \"a\" within 24 hours of being notified by the department of its invalidation decision. The sample must be analyzed for the same fecal indicator using the analytical methods in 41.7(3) \"c.\" The department may extend the 24-hour time limit on a case-by-case basis if the system cannot collect the source water sample within 24 hours due to circumstances beyond the system' s control. In the case of an extension, the department must specify how much time the system has to collect the sample. e. Sampling location. (1) Any groundwater source sample required under 41.7(3) \"a\" must be collected at a location prior to any treatment of the groundwater source unless the department approves a sampling location after treatment. (2) If the system' s configuration does not allow for sampling at the well itself, the system may collect a sample at a department-approved location to meet the requirements of 41.7(3) \"a\" if the sample is representative of the water quality of that well. f. New sour ces. A groundwater system that places a new groundwater source into service must conduct assessment source water monitoring as directed by the department to include those items listed in 41.7(3) \"b\" (3) to (6). If directed by the department, the system must begin monitoring before the groundwater source is used to provide water to the public. g. Public notification. A system with a groundwater source sample collected under 41.7(3) \"a\" or 41.7(3) \"b\" that is fecal indicator -positive and that is not invalidated under 41.7(3) \"d,\" including consecutive systems served by the groundwater source, must conduct T ier 1 public notification under 567\u2014subrule 42.1(2). h. Monitoring violations. Failure to meet the requirements of 41.7(3) \"a\" through 41.7(3) \"f\" is a monitoring violation and requires the system to provide T ier 3 public notification under 567\u2014subrule 42.1(4). 41.7 (4) T r eatment technique r equir ements for gr oundwater systems. a. Gr oundwater systems with significant deficiencies or sour ce water fecal contamination. (1) The treatment technique requirements of this subrule, 41.7(4), must be met by groundwater systems when a significant deficiency is identified or when a groundwater source sample collected under 41.7(3) \"a\" (3) is fecal indicator -positive. (2) If directed by the department, a groundwater system with a groundwater source sample collected under 41.7(3) \"a\" (2), 41.7(3) \"a\" (4), or 41.7(3) \"b\" that is fecal indicator -positive must comply with the treatment technique requirements of 41.7(4). (3) When a significant deficiency is identified at a surface water or influenced groundwater system that also uses a groundwater source not under the influence of surface water , the system must comply with provisions of 41.7(4) \"a\" except in cases where the department determines that the significant deficiency is in a portion of the distribution system that is served solely by the surface water or influenced groundwater source. (4) Unless the department directs the groundwater system to implement a specific corrective action, the groundwater system must consult with the department regarding the appropriate corrective action within 30 days of receiving written notice from the department of a significant deficiency , written notice from a laboratory that a groundwater source sample collected under 41.7(3) \"a\" (3) was found to be fecal IAB 1/17/18 NOTICES 1655 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) indicator -positive, or direction from the department that a fecal indicator -positive sample collected under 41.7(3) \"a\" (2), 41.7(3) \"a\" (4), or 41.7(3) \"b\" requires corrective action. For the purposes of 41.7(4), significant deficiencies include, but are not limited to, defects in design, operation, or maintenance, or a failure or malfunction of the sources, treatment, storage, or distribution system that the department determines to be causing, or have potential for causing, the introduction of contamination into the water delivered to consumers. (5) W ithin 120 days, or earlier if directed by the department, of receiving written notification from the department of a significant deficiency , written notice from a laboratory that a groundwater source sample collected under 41.7(3) \"a\" (3) was found to be fecal indicator -positive, or direction from the department that a fecal indicator -positive sample collected under 41.7(3) \"a\" (2), 41.7(3) \"a\" (4), or 41.7(3) \"b\" requires corrective action, the groundwater system must either: 1. Have completed corrective action in accordance with applicable department plan review processes or other department guidance or direction, if any , including department-specified interim measures; or 2. Be in compliance with a department-approved corrective action plan and schedule subject to the specified conditions as follows: Any subsequent modifications to a department-approved corrective action plan and schedule must also be approved by the department; and If the department specifies interim measures for protection of the public health pending department approval of the corrective action plan and schedule, or pending completion of the corrective action plan, the system must comply with these interim measures as well as with any schedule specified by the department. (6) Corrective action alternatives. Groundwater systems that meet the conditions of 41.7(4) \"a\" (1) or (2) must implement one or more of the following corrective action alternatives: 1. Correct all significant deficiencies; 2. Provide an alternate source of water; 3. Eliminate the source of contamination; or 4. Provide treatment that reliably achieves at least 4-log treatment of viruses for the groundwater source. (7) Special notice to the public of significant deficiencies or source water fecal contamination. 1. In addition to the applicable T ier 1 public notification requirements of 567\u2014subrule 42.1(2), a community groundwater system that receives notice from the department of a significant deficiency or notification of a fecal indicator -positive groundwater source sample that is not invalidated by the department under 41.7(3) \"d\" must inform the public served by the water system under 567\u2014subparagraph 42.3(3) \"h\" (5) of the fecal indicator -positive source sample or of any significant deficiency that has not been corrected. The system must continue to inform the public annually until the significant deficiency is corrected or the fecal contamination in the groundwater source is determined by the department to be corrected under 41.7(3) \"a\" (5). 2. In addition to the applicable T ier 1 public notification requirements of 567\u2014subrule 42.1(2), a noncommunity groundwater system that receives notice from the department of a significant deficiency must inform the public served by the water systems in a manner approved by the department of any significant deficiency that has not been corrected within 12 months of being notified by the department or earlier if directed by the department. The system must continue to inform the public annually until the significant deficiency is corrected. The information must include: The nature of the significant deficiency and the date the significant deficiency was identified by the department; The department-approved plan and schedule for correction of the significant deficiency , including interim measures, progress to date, and any interim measures completed; and For systems with a lar ge proportion of non-English speaking consumers, as determined by the department, information in the applicable language(s) regarding the importance of the notice or a telephone number or address where consumers may contact the system to obtain a translated copy of the notice or assistance in the appropriate language. 1656 NOTICES IAB 1/17/18 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) 3. If directed by the department, a noncommunity water system with significant deficiencies that have been corrected must inform its customers of the significant deficiencies, how the deficiencies were corrected, and the dates of correction under 41.7(4) \"a\" (7)\"2.\" b. Compliance monitoring. (1) Existing groundwater sources. A groundwater system that provides at least 4-log treatment of viruses must make a written application to the department in order to avoid the source water monitoring requirements of 41.7(3). Notification to the department must include engineering, operational, or other information that the department requests to evaluate the submission. The department must approve the 4-log request in writing before the system can avoid the groundwater source monitoring requirements. The system' s operation permit will include the mandatory operational requirements for the approved 4-log virus treatment. If the system subsequently discontinues 4-log treatment of viruses of a groundwater source or no longer wishes to be exempt from the groundwater source monitoring requirements, the system must conduct groundwater source monitoring as required under 41.7(3). (2) New groundwater sources. A groundwater system that places a groundwater source in service that is not required to meet the source water monitoring requirements of 41.7(4) because the system provides at least 4-log treatment of viruses for the groundwater source must comply with the following requirements: 1. The system must notify the department in writing that it provides at least 4-log treatment of viruses for the groundwater source. Notification to the department must include engineering, operational, or other information that the department requests to evaluate the submission. The contact time values for inactivation of viruses using free chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and ozone are listed in 567\u2014Chapter 43, Appendix C. No CT table is provided for chloramines and total chlorine because the CT values would be prohibitively high for groundwater systems. 2. The system must conduct compliance monitoring as required under 41.7(4) \"b\" (3) within 30 days of placing the source in service. 3. The system must conduct groundwater source monitoring under 41.7(3) if the system subsequently discontinues 4-log treatment of viruses for the groundwater source. (3) Monitoring requirements. A groundwater system subject to the requirements of 41.7(4) \"a\" and 41.7(4) \"b\" (1) and (2) must monitor the ef fectiveness and reliability of treatment for that groundwater source before or at the first customer as follows: 1. Chemical disinfection. A groundwater system serving more than 3,300 people must continuously monitor the residual disinfectant concentration, using analytical methods specified in 567\u2014subparagraph 43.5(4) \"a\" (5), at a location approved by the department and must record the lowest residual disinfectant concentration each day that water from the groundwater source is served to the public. The groundwater system must maintain the department-determined minimum residual disinfectant concentration every day the groundwater system serves water from the groundwater source to the public. If there is a failure in the continuous monitoring equipment, the groundwater system must conduct grab sampling every four hours until the continuous monitoring equipment is returned to service. The system must resume continuous residual disinfectant monitoring within 14 days. A groundwater system serving 3,300 or fewer people must monitor the residual disinfectant concentration using analytical methods specified in 567\u2014subparagraph 43.5(4) \"a\" (5) at a location approved by the department and must record the residual disinfectant concentration each day that water from the groundwater source is served to the public. The groundwater system must maintain the department-determined minimum residual disinfectant concentration every day the groundwater system serves water from the groundwater source to the public. The groundwater system must take a daily grab sample during the hour of peak flow or at another time specified by the department. If any daily grab sample measurement falls below the department-determined minimum residual disinfectant concentration, the groundwater system must take follow-up samples every four hours until the residual disinfectant concentration is restored to the department-determined minimum level. Alternatively , a groundwater system that serves 3,300 or fewer people may monitor continuously and meet the requirements of 41.7(4) \"b\" (3)\"1,\" first bulleted paragraph. IAB 1/17/18 NOTICES 1657 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) 2. Membrane filtration. A groundwater system that uses membrane filtration to meet the requirements of 41.7(4) \"b\" to provide at least 4-log treatment of viruses must monitor the membrane filtration process in accordance with all department-specified monitoring requirements and must operate the membrane filtration in accordance with all department-specified compliance requirements. A groundwater system that uses membrane filtration is in compliance with the requirement to achieve at least 4-log removal of viruses when: The membrane has an absolute molecular weight cut-of f (MWCO), or an alternate parameter that describes the exclusion characteristics of the membrane, that can reliably achieve at least 4-log removal of viruses; The membrane process is operated in accordance with department-specified compliance requirements; and The integrity of the membrane is intact. 3. Alternative treatment. A groundwater system that uses a department-approved alternative treatment to meet the requirements of 41.7(4) \"b\" by providing at least 4-log treatment of viruses must: Monitor the alternative treatment in accordance with all department-specified monitoring requirements; and Operate the alternative treatment in accordance with all compliance requirements that the department determines to be necessary to achieve at least 4-log treatment of viruses. c. Discontinuing tr eatment. A groundwater system may discontinue 4-log treatment of viruses for a groundwater source if the department determines and documents in writing that 4-log treatment of viruses is no longer necessary for that groundwater source. A system that discontinues 4-log treatment of viruses is subject to the source water monitoring and analytical methods requirements of 41.7(3). d. Monitoring violation. Failure to meet the monitoring requirements of 41.7(4) \"b\" is a monitoring violation and requires the groundwater system to provide T ier 3 public notification under 567\u2014subrule 42.1(4). 41.7 (5) T r eatment technique violations for gr oundwater systems. A groundwater system must give T ier 2 public notification under 567\u2014subrule 42.1(3) for the treatment technique violations specified in 41.7(5) 41.7(5) \"b,\" and 41.7(5) \"c.\" a. Significant deficiency . A groundwater system with a significant deficiency is in violation of the treatment technique requirement if, within 120 days (or earlier if directed by the department) of receiving written notice from the department of the significant deficiency , the system: (1) Does not complete corrective action in accordance with any applicable department plan review processes or other department guidance and direction, including department-specified interim actions and measures; or (2) Is not in compliance with a department-approved corrective action plan and schedule. b. Fecal indicator -positive sour ce sample. Unless the department invalidates a fecal indicator -positive groundwater source sample under 41.7(3) \"d\" (1), a groundwater system is in violation of the treatment technique requirement if, within 120 days (or earlier if directed by the department) of meeting the conditions of 41.7(4) \"a\" (1) or (2), the system: (1) Does not complete corrective action in accordance with any applicable department plan review processes or other department guidance and direction, including department-specified interim measures; or (2) Is not in compliance with a department-approved corrective action plan and schedule. c. Failur e to maintain 4-log tr eatment. A groundwater system subject to the requirements of 41.7(4) \"b\" (3) that fails to maintain at least 4-log treatment of viruses for a groundwater source is in violation of the treatment technique requirement if the failure is not corrected within four hours of the determination that the system is not maintaining at least 4-log treatment of viruses before or at the first customer . 41.7 (6) Reporting and r ecor d keeping for gr oundwater systems. a. Reporting. In addition to meeting the requirements of 567\u2014subrule 42.4(1), a groundwater system regulated under this rule must provide the following information to the department: 1658 NOTICES IAB 1/17/18 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) (1) A groundwater system conducting compliance monitoring under 41.7(4) \"b\" must notify the department any time the system fails to meet any of the department-specified requirements for 4-log virus treatment including, but not limited to, minimum residual disinfectant concentration, membrane operating criteria or membrane integrity , and alternative treatment operating criteria, if operation in accordance with the criteria or requirements is not restored within four hours. The groundwater system must notify the department as soon as possible, but in no case later than the end of the next business day . (2) After completing any corrective action under 41.7(4) \"a,\" a groundwater system must notify the department within 30 days of completion of the corrective action. (3) If a groundwater system subject to the requirements of 41.7(3) \"a\" does not conduct source water monitoring under 41.7(3) \"a\" (5)\"2,\" the system must provide documentation to the department within 30 days of the total coliform-positive sample that it met the department' s criteria. b.

The tar geted group person owner(s) must have an overall understanding of, managerial and technical competence in, and expertise directly related to the type of business in which the firm is engaged and in the firm' s operations. Generally , expertise limited to of fice management, administration, or bookkeeping functions unrelated to the activities of the business is insuf ficient to demonstrate control of the business; (4) Independent risk of loss and share of profit by the tar geted group person owner(s) is commensurate with the owner ' s proportion of ownership. b. Fifty-one percent or more of securities which constitute ownership or control of a corporation for purposes of establishing it as a TSB shall be held directly by tar geted group persons. c. An inherited business may be eligible for tar geted small business status. Capital contribution, expertise and experience in the inherited business are not required. All other standards apply . d. Documentation may be required to prove compliance with all standards. 261\u201452. 5 (15) Special consideration. In addition to the above standards, the authority may consider other circumstances to determine eligibility . Consideration of other circumstances is intended to ensure that only bona fide tar geted group person-owned businesses are certified. IAB 1/17/18 FILED 1781 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY[261](cont'd) 52.5 (1) A previous or continuing employer -employee relationship between present owners will be carefully reviewed to ensure that the employee-owner has substantial management and decision-making responsibilities. 52.5 (2) At the discretion of the authority , on-site audits may be conducted to determine eligibility . 261\u201452. 6 (15) Family-owned business. Businesses which are owned and operated by one or more members of the same family will be closely scrutinized to determine whether the tar geted group person identified as the owner of 51 percent or more of the business does in fact set policy and make day-to-day and long-term decisions for the operation and management of the business. 52.6 (1) If any of the circumstances below prevail, the business shall be considered a family-owned business. Nontar geted group person family-owned businesses are not eligible for certification as tar geted small businesses in Iowa. Any characteristic listed below may be cause to deny tar geted small business status. This list is not to be construed as complete. a. If a nontar geted group person family member: (1) Is chief executive of ficer or president; (2) Provides the expertise to conduct the business; (3) T ransfers ownership to the tar geted group person owner for less than fair market value; (4) Receives compensation equal to or greater than the tar geted group person owner , not commensurate with their ownership; (5) Provides occupational services for the business for less than fair market value; (6) Possesses powers equal to or greater than the tar geted group person owner to direct management and operations. b. If the tar geted group person owner: (1) Is represented to those outside the business as not possessing the final authority to direct the operations and management of the business; (2) Cannot document the date upon which the nontar geted group person family member was hired. c. A recent transfer of ownership by a nontar geted group person family member to a tar geted group person will be reviewed to determine if the previous owner is still the principal decision maker on policy or actually manages the existing business. T ransfers in the past two years are considered recent, and these businesses shall not be certified, unless evidence substantiating the transfer is received and approved. 52.6 (2) If a lending institution requires a signature other than the TSB owner ' s, another person may sign. When this happens, the owner must have the experience and expertise to own and operate the business. If a nontar geted group person family member has the expertise and has cosigned for business loans, the business is not eligible. 261\u201452. 7 (15) Cottage industry . A cottage industry business may be eligible for certification as a TSB. 52.7 (1) Characteristics of these businesses include, but are not limited to: a. At least 51 percent of business equipment shall be owned by tar geted group persons. b. Business risks and profits shall be borne by the tar geted group person owner(s) proportionate to the owner ' s ownership. 52.7 (2) The intent of tar geting some small businesses is to identify those businesses which have been traditionally excluded from economic growth. Therefore, for a cottage industry business, the residence and any adjacent outbuildings used by the cottage industry may be owned jointly with other family members. 52.7 (3) All other TSB eligibility standards apply to the cottage industry . 261\u201452. 8 (15) Decertification. A business shall be decertified by the authority if it is determined the business no longer complies with the requirements of the TSB program or its owners cannot be located by the authority . 1782 FILED IAB 1/17/18 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY[261](cont'd) 52.8 (1) W ritten notice of the intent to revoke certification shall be provided when the authority determines there is reasonable cause to believe a business does not comply . Notice shall be sent by U.S. mail at least 20 days before decertification is ef fective. 52.8 (2) If the authority sends a letter by first-class mail to the last-known address provided to the authority by the TSB and it is returned as undeliverable, this is considered to be grounds for decertification. 52.8 (3) Decertification procedures may be initiated by the authority or after the investigation of a complaint filed by the general public. A request for an investigation from the public must be written and shall specify the reason(s) why the certified tar geted small business no longer complies with these rules. Supporting documentation may be attached to the request. 52.8 (4) Eligibility to participate in the TSB program continues until the final decision is issued by the authority . 261\u201452. 9 (15) Request for bond waiver . A tar geted small business seeking a performance, surety , or bid bond waiver shall submit a sworn statement that it is unable to secure a performance, surety , or bid bond because of lack of experience, lack of net worth, or lack of capital. Documentation will be requested from surety companies that the TSB is unable to obtain performance, surety , or bid bonding because of the lack of experience, lack of net worth, or lack of capital. 52.9 (1) A waiver shall be applied only to a prime contract where the project or individual transaction does not exceed $50,000, notwithstanding Iowa Code section 573.2 . 52.9 (2) Granting a waiver shall not relieve any business from its contractual obligations. The state agency or department may pursue any remedy under law upon default or breach of contract. 52.9 (3) The authority reviews all bond waiver documents. Information to assist the review process may be requested from the state department or agency involved. An applicant for a performance, surety , or bid bond waiver and the department or agency involved will be notified of the decision by U.S. mail. 52.9 (4) Bond waivers will be reviewed and renewed at the time of TSB recertification. 261\u201452. 10 (15) Fraudulent practices in connection with targeted small business pr ograms. A violation under this rule is grounds for decertification of the TSB connected with the violation. Decertification shall be in addition to any penalty otherwise authorized by this chapter . 52.10 (1) A person is considered to be guilty of a fraudulent practice if the person: a. Knowingly transfers or assigns assets, ownership, or equitable interest in property of a business to a tar geted group person primarily for the purpose of obtaining benefits under TSB programs if the transferor would otherwise not be qualified for such programs. b. Solicits and is awarded a state contract on behalf of a TSB for the purpose of transferring the contract to another for a percentage if the person transferring or intending to transfer the work had no intention of performing the work. c. Knowingly falsifies information on an application for the purpose of obtaining benefits under TSB programs. 52.10 (2) The authority may investigate allegations or complaints of fraudulent practices and will take action to decertify a TSB upon concluding that a violation has occurred. A decertification by this action may be appealed. These rules are intended to implement Iowa Code OR ' S N OTE : For replacement pages for IAC, see IAC Supplement 1/17/18. IAB 1/17/18 FILED 1783 ARC 3583C ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION [567] Adopted and Filed Rule making r elated to water quality The Environmental Protection Commission hereby amends Chapter 61, \"W ater Quality Standards,\" and Chapter 62, \"Ef fluent and Pretreatment Standards: Other Ef fluent Limitations or Prohibitions,\" Iowa Administrative Code. Legal Authority for Rule Making This rule making is adopted under the authority provided in Iowa Code sections 455B.105(1 1)\"a,\" 455B.173(2) and 455B.173(3). State or Federal Law Implemented This rule making implements, in whole or in part, Iowa Code sections 455B.173(2), 455B.173(3) and 455B.105(1 1)\"a.\" Purpose and Summary The purpose of the amendments is to update the name of the document referenced in the rules from \"'Supporting Document for Iowa W ater Quality Management Plans,' Chapter IV , July 1976, as revised on November 1 1, 2009\" to \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure\" to more clearly reflect the contents of the document. A wasteload allocation (WLA) is the portion of a water body' s assimilative capacity that is allocated to an existing or future point source dischar ge. This document establishes the technical methodologies the Department of Natural Resources (Department) uses to develop WLAs and water quality-based ef fluent limits for point source dischar gers. In addition to the update of its name, the document has been revised to make it more understandable and better describe the procedures used in WLA calculations. The revision will also provide greater flexibility to facilities seeking alternative permitting options. The major elements of the Iowa WLA Procedure document revision are as follows: a. Update the Stream Low-Flow V alues for United States Geological Survey (USGS) gaged sites and ungaged sites based on the USGS low-flow study report \"Methods for Estimating Selected Low-Flow Frequency Statistics and Harmonic Mean Flows for Streams in Iowa,\" by David A. Eash and Kimberlee K. Barnes, published in 2012 and revised in 2013. This change incorporates the most up-to-date stream critical low flows published by USGS to better reflect actual stream low flows; b. Incorporate statewide default background chemical concentrations using the most up-to-date monitoring data available; c. Incorporate statewide default ef fluent chemical concentrations for dif ferent types of wastewater treatment plants using the most up-to-date ef fluent monitoring data available; d. Replace the total residual chlorine default decay value in the mixing zone with site-specific decay measurements; e. Incorporate the current implementation procedures for the chloride and sulfate criteria that were adopted in 2009; f. Revise the E. coli WLA procedures for both continuous and noncontinuous dischar ges in accordance with the limitation on end of pipe permit limits established at 62.8(2); g. Revise the E. coli decay rate coef ficient to be consistent with that of other Department programs; 1784 FILED IAB 1/17/18 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) h. Revise the temperature criteria implementation procedure to incorporate all elements of the temperature criteria in Chapter 61 for dif ferent designated uses. The revision to the temperature criteria implementation procedure provides flexibility for facilities seeking alternative permitting options; i. Modify the WLA procedure for pH so that pH criteria must be met at the boundary of the mixing zone instead of the boundary of the zone of initial dilution. This modification will result in increased dilution for pH WLA calculations; j. Clarify the current mixing zone procedures and the requirements for mixing zone and dif fuser studies; k. Incorporate a Site-Specific Data Collection procedure in order to standardize the site-specific data collection process. The revision will have fewer sampling requirements and will result in cost savings for point source dischar ge facilities seeking site-specific permit limits; l. Revise the W ater Quality Modeling section to replace previous models with commonly used and modernized QUALIIK and modified Streeter -Phelps models. The revisions also update decay rates and reaeration rates to reflect the latest scientific data; m. Add a reference to the antidegradation implementation procedure document; and n. Add a new section on Alternative Site-Specific Methodology for W ater Quality Based Limits that provides point source dischar ge facilities with the flexibility to develop site-specific NPDES permit limits. Other minor revisions to the document include improvements in the estimation of ammonia nitrogen decay calculations in dischar ge pipes and general use segments, clarification of the procedure for determining dischar ge flows used in WLAs, and clarification of various sections to make the document more understandable. The \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure\" ater -Quality/W asteload-Allocations . The amendments also update references to the Department' s website. Public Comment and Changes to Rule Making Notice of Intended Action for this rule making was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin on July 19, 2017, as ARC 3202C . Three public hearings were held as follows: September 5, 2017 - W ashington Public Library September 6, 2017 - Urbandale Public Library September 7, 2017 - Harlan Community Library A responsiveness summary has been prepared and is available at: www .iowadnr .gov/Environmental-Protection/W ater -Quality/W ater -Quality-Standards . The most notable change made in response to public comments is retention of the single sample maximum criterion for E. coli in Chapter 61. The Notice of Intended Action proposed to remove this criterion. The Department will instead consider potential changes to the E. coli criteria during the Department' s regular triennial review process and will solicit further public input at that time. Adoption of Rule Making This rule making was adopted by the Environmental Protection Commission on December 19, 2017. Fiscal Impact Overall, this rule making is anticipated to result in a cost savings ranging from $26 million to $58 million for point source dischar ge facilities across the state. This savings results primarily from the changes to the Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure document described above. These changes IAB 1/17/18 FILED 1785 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) create increased flexibility for permittees and result in an overall reduction in regulatory burden. It is expected that the potential costs associated with this rule making are negligible. The Department prepared a detailed analysis of this rule making' s fiscal impact. That analysis is available upon request. Jobs Impact The cost savings resulting from this rule making will have a positive impact on private sector jobs and employment opportunities in the state. Lower wastewater treatment costs at industrial facilities are expected to have a positive impact on jobs because industries can put the savings toward investment in their businesses, including job growth. Similarly , businesses and industries that dischar ge to municipal wastewater treatment plants will benefit from lower utility rates if the municipal wastewater treatment plant can lower its operating costs as a result of this rule making. That savings on utility rates for businesses and industries can be put toward investment in their companies to create jobs. W aivers This rule making is subject to the waiver provisions of 561\u2014Chapter 10, as adopted by reference at 567\u201413.1(17A), to the extent such waiver is consistent with federal water quality standards requirements. Any person who believes that the application of the discretionary provisions of this rule making would result in hardship or injustice to that person may petition for a waiver of the discretionary provisions, if any . Review by Administrative Rules Review Committee The Administrative Rules Review Committee, a bipartisan legislative committee which oversees rule making by executive branch agencies, may , on its own motion or on written request by any individual or group, review this rule making at its regular monthly meeting or at a special meeting. The Committee' s meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may be heard as provided in Iowa Code section 17A.8(6). Effective Date This rule making will become ef fective on February 21, 2018. The following rule-making actions are adopted: I TEM 1 . Amend paragraph 61.2(4)\"a\" as follows: a. Due to extreme variations in wastewater and receiving water characteristics, spatial dimensions of mixing zones shall be defined on a site-specific basis. These rules are not intended to define each individual mixing zone, but will set maximum limits which will satisfy most biological, chemical, physical and radiological considerations in defining a particular mixing zone. Additional details are noted in the \"Supporting Document for Iowa W ater Quality Management Plans,\" Chapter IV , July 1976, as revised on November 1 1, 2009 \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure,\" as revised on February 21, 2018 , for considering unusual site-specific features such as side channels and sand bars which may influence a mixing zone. Applications for operation permits under 567\u2014subrule 64.3(1) may be required to provide specific information related to the mixing zone characteristics below their outfall so that mixing zone boundaries can be determined. I TEM 2 . Amend paragraph 61.2(4)\"b,\" introductory paragraph, as follows: b. For parameters included in T able 1 only (which does not include ammonia nitrogen), the dimensions of the mixing zone and the zone of initial dilution will be calculated using a mathematical model presented in the \"Supporting Document for Iowa W ater Quality Management Plans,\" Chapter IV , July 1976, as revised on November 1 1, 2009 \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure,\" as revised on February 21, 2018 , or from instream studies of the mixing characteristics during low flow . In addition, the most restrictive of the following factors will be met: 1786 FILED IAB 1/17/18 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) I TEM 3 . Amend subparagraph 61.2(4)\"d\"(4) as follows: (4) A dischar ger to interior streams and rivers, the Big Sioux and Des Moines Rivers, and the Mississippi or Missouri Rivers may provide to the department, for consideration, instream data which technically supports the allowance of an increased percentage of the stream flow contained in the mixing zone due to rapid and complete mixing. Any allowed increase in mixing zone flow would still be governed by the mixing zone length restrictions. The submission of data should follow the guidance provided in the \"Supporting Document for Iowa W ater Quality Management Plans,\" Chapter IV , July 1976, as revised on November 1 1, 2009 \"Iowa W asteload Allocation (WLA) Procedure,\" as revised on February 21, 2018 .

ARC 3584C ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION [567] Adopted and Filed Rule making r elated to water quality The Environmental Protection Commission hereby amends Chapter 64, \"W astewater Construction and Operation Permits,\" Iowa Administrative Code. Legal Authority for Rule Making This rule making is adopted under the authority provided in Iowa Code sections 455B.103A, 455B.105(3) and 455B.173. State or Federal Law Implemented This rule making implements, in whole or in part, Iowa Code sections 455B.103A, 455B.105(3), 455B.173 and 455B.186. Purpose and Summary The amendments to Chapter 64 reissue National Pollutant Dischar ge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permits Nos. 1, 2 and 3, which authorize the dischar ge of storm water . General Permits Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were last reissued in 2012 for a five-year duration and expired October 1, 2017. These amendments renew all three permits, extending their coverage for another five years, to expire February 28, 2023. General permits for storm water dischar ges are required to be adopted by reference and are ef fective for no more than five years as specified in the Iowa Administrative Code. No changes other than changes in dates and updates to Iowa Code and Iowa Administrative Code references are adopted for General Permit No. 1. Several changes have been made for General Permit No. 2 (GP2). These changes include updates to federal ef fluent requirements for construction and development point sources set out in 40 CFR 450.21. One of the federal requirements is that areas of sites where construction activity will not occur for 14 or more days must have stabilization measures initiated immediately . The current requirement in GP2 is that areas of sites where construction activity will not occur for 21 or more days must have stabilization measures initiated on those areas no later than 14 days after no construction activity has occurred on them. The changes to GP2 will adopt the federal requirement regarding soil stabilization. Other than this soil stabilization requirement, all federal ef fluent requirements being added to GP2 are already found in various sections of the general permit though described using dif ferent verbiage. Other changes for GP2 are clarifications of existing requirements and updates to Iowa Code and Iowa Administrative Code reference changes. The changes adopted for General Permit No. 3 are a clarification added at the request of stakeholders that explains an existing prohibition on the dischar ge of vehicle washwaters, changes in ef fective dates and updates to Iowa Code and Iowa Administrative Code references. IAB 1/17/18 FILED 1789 ENVIRONMENT AL PROTECTION COMMISSION[567](cont'd) It is not the intent of the Commission that the textual changes in general permits be adopted in the Iowa Administrative Code but that these changes be made in the general permits themselves, which are adopted by reference into the Iowa Administrative Code. Copies of the revised general permits are available upon request from the Department of Natural Resources (Department) at the address or telephone number below . Public Comment and Changes to Rule Making Notice of Intended Action for this rule making was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin on September 13, 2017, as ARC 3309C . A public hearing was held on October 10, 2017. Comments received during the public hearing related to the vagueness of the required federal language. The comments and responses may be obtained by contacting the Department' s Storm W ater Coordinator , Joe Grif fin, at joe.grif fin@dnr -Quality/NPDES-Storm-W ater .

A person licensed by the board under Iowa Code chapter 148 shall not be subject to discipline under this chapter or the board' s enabling statute based solely on the physician' s recommendation or provision of a treatment method for L yme disease or other tick-borne disease if the recommendation or provision of such treatment meets all the following criteria: a. The treatment is provided after an examination is performed and informed consent is received from the patient. b. The physician identifies a medical reason for recommending or providing the treatment. c. The treatment is provided after the physician informs the patient about other recognized treatment options and describes to the patient the physician' s education, experience, and credentials regarding the treatment of L yme disease or other tick-borne disease. d.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), L yme disease is caused by the bacterium Borr elia bur gdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, commonly known as deer ticks. T ypical symptoms include fever , headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. If left untreated, infection can spread to joints, the heart, and the nervous system. L yme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings (e.g., a rash), and the possibility of exposure to infected ticks. Laboratory testing is helpful if used correctly and performed with validated methods. Steps to prevent L yme disease include using insect repellent, removing ticks promptly , applying pesticides, and reducing tick habitat. The ticks that transmit L yme disease can occasionally transmit other tick-borne diseases as well. 13.14 (3) L yme disease tr eatment. Most cases of L yme disease can be treated successfully with a few weeks of antibiotics. Over the past several years, the International L yme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) has supported longer courses of antibiotics for some patients, versus the prescribed treatment durations identified by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and referenced by the CDC. While IDSA has expressed concern about overtreatment, ILADS points out that treatment decisions should be based on a risk-benefit analysis. Both groups have published evidence-based guidelines. 13.14 (4) T ick-borne diseases. According to the CDC, tick-borne diseases include: a. Anaplasmosis is transmitted to humans by tick bites primarily from the blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) in the northeastern and upper midwestern regions of the United States (U.S.) and the western blacklegged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ) along the Pacific coast. b.

Borr elia miyamotoi infection has recently been described as a cause of illness in the U.S. This infection is transmitted by the blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) and has a geographic range similar to that of L yme disease. e. Bourbon virus infection has been identified in a limited number of patients in the midwestern and southern regions of the U.S. At this time, it is not known if the virus might be found in other areas of the U.S. f.

ARC 3592C PUBLIC SAFETY DEP AR TMENT [661] Adopted and Filed Rule making r elated to licensur e to sell and safety standards for consumer fir eworks The State Fire Marshal hereby adopts new Chapter 265, \"Consumer Fireworks Sales Licensing and Safety Standards,\" Iowa Administrative Code. Legal Authority for Rule Making This rule making is adopted under the authority provided in Iowa Code sections 100.19 and 100.19A. State or Federal Law Implemented This rule making implements, in whole or in part, Iowa Code sections 100.19 and 100.19A. Purpose and Summary 2017 Iowa Acts, Senate File 489, relating to the purchase, use, and regulation of consumer and display fireworks, was enacted in 2017 by the Iowa General Assembly during its regular session. The legislation, which is now codified in the Iowa Code, requires the State Fire Marshal to promulgate administrative rules for the regulation of the storage, transportation, handling, and use of consumer fireworks; for the sale of consumer fireworks; and for the licensing of consumer fireworks retailers and registration of wholesalers of consumer fireworks. The legislation also authorizes the licensing fees that are collected to be used to pay for the costs of administration and enforcement of the legislation and establishes a Local Fire Protection and Emer gency Medical Service Providers Grant Program to provide fireworks safety education and to purchase equipment related to the sale and use of consumer fireworks. 1820 FILED IAB 1/17/18 PUBLIC SAFETY DEP AR TMENT[661](cont'd) Public Comment and Changes to Rule Making Notice of Intended Action for this rule making was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin on June 21, 2017, as ARC 3123C . This rule making was also Adopted and Filed Emer gency and published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin as ARC 3124C on the same date and became ef fective on May 31, 2017. A public hearing was held on September 8, 2017. W ritten and oral comments were received from stakeholders and members of the public prior to or at the public hearing. Additionally , stakeholders were invited to submit comments after the final rules were drafted, and an informal stakeholder meeting was held on December 15, 2017, to receive comments on the final draft of the rules. Changes in response to comments and suggestions received were incorporated into these Adopted and Filed rules. The stakeholder groups generally were composed of industry representatives and nonindustry representatives. Both industry and nonindustry representatives of fered comments concerning the initial fireworks sales period and also of fered constructive comments for the purpose of improving the rules and implementing the safety standards of NFP A 1 124. There were other comments received from members of the public who were opposed to the policy of legalizing fireworks. The changes that were made from the emer gency rules to these Adopted and Filed rules primarily involve the licensing process, which contained steps needed to implement the rules in a short period of time, and the inspections, for the same reason. Some rules were also reordered and renumbered, and citations have been updated. Comments from nonindustry members included broad-based opposition to fireworks, along with specific comments about the regulatory system set out in the new legislation. Specific comments from nonindustry members included: Question regarding the ef ficacy of a revocation process that does not provide for immediate action if the licensee is in violation of the rules. Suggestion that licenses should be issued for a single sales period rather than for a year (which could cover two or more seasons). Question regarding a possible conflict between the NFP A standards regarding fireworks and the current state or local fire code provisions. Question regarding the appropriate action to be taken when an inspection of a fireworks sale site shows that the site does not match the site plan submitted and approved. Question regarding storage facilities, which require no separate licensing, and the impact on public safety in the jurisdictions where storage facilities are located. Question regarding verification of sites that sell exempt amounts, which are not subject to inspection, and particularly whether it is possible to identify compliance with the regulatory exemption for exempt-amount sales. Statement that local authorities are best suited to address public safety concerns at a local level. Question regarding local jurisdictional authority regarding related regulations and statutes, including local ordinances related to hazardous materials, noise and zoning. Statement that local authorities should be notified regarding licensee locations, for their awareness. Statement that the rules that require training of personnel who are staf fing the sales location should be enforced, in order to ensure compliance. Comment regarding the time required to conduct inspections of every site, and the cost associated with that time, and the need for adequate compensation for that time, either through state-funded inspectors or through reimbursements to local agencies conducting inspections. Comments from industry members included: Comment regarding the apparent inequity experienced by in-state permanent-site license holders, who pay a higher fee, and out-of-state retailers at temporary sites, which require a lower fee. IAB 1/17/18 FILED 1821 PUBLIC SAFETY DEP AR TMENT[661](cont'd) Comment regarding the value of a statewide system for licensing and inspections, which can provide consistency for multiple-site sellers, and especially for temporary-site licensees. Comment related to pending litigation regarding local ordinances and local fees char ged in addition to the state licensing requirements. Comment that the statute creates a state licensing and regulatory program, which does not allow for additional local regulation or control over the retail sales of consumer fireworks. Comment that inspections should be focused on compliance on site, and other licensing processes could be streamlined so long as compliance inspections occur . Comment regarding the limitation of local authorities to char ge fees for compliance inspections and the limitation on local authorities' ability to use zoning codes or other local ordinances to interfere with otherwise lawful consumer fireworks activities. The State Fire Marshal reviewed and considered the comments received at the public hearing in adopting these rules as well as the other comments received informally . Based on the input from many stakeholders, these rules were drafted to closely follow the legislation and to closely follow the rule-making authority granted in the legislation. The statutory parameters are workable, and the State Fire Marshal' s of fice has worked closely with all stakeholders to identify ways to implement the statutory requirements through administrative rules that can be applied in practical ways to comply with the statute and accommodate the needs of the private sector and local governments. Along with the experience gained during the first licensing period, input from stakeholders was helpful in drafting the final rules. Adoption of Rule Making This rule making was adopted by the State Fire Marshal on December 27, 2017. Fiscal Impact The fiscal impact for the program is expected to be between $100,000 and $500,000; although at present, it is anticipated that annual costs to administer the program will be around $100,000. Annual costs include the costs of administering the licensing program, the costs associated with inspections and the enforcement of laws and regulations by the State Fire Marshal' s of fice. Revenues from fees that are not retained for program costs will be distributed to local fire and emer gency response entities through the grant program authorized by statute. Based on the number of licenses issued during the first two seasons, it appears that the fireworks program will be self-sustaining and that a grant program can be established that can benefit local communities in Iowa. Jobs Impact It is expected that there will be a positive impact on jobs and the economy , as there will be new opportunities for persons to be employed in the sale of fireworks. There will be a positive impact on the state economy from these new jobs and new business opportunities resulting from the sale of consumer fireworks, and from the sales tax revenue paid to the state from the sale of consumer fireworks. W aivers Pursuant to the provisions of rule 661\u201410.222(17A), the State Fire Marshal does not have authority to waive requirements established by statute. Review by Administrative Rules Review Committee The Administrative Rules Review Committee, a bipartisan legislative committee which oversees rule making by executive branch agencies, may , on its own motion or on written request by any individual or group, review this rule making at its regular monthly meeting or at a special meeting. The Committee' s meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may be heard as provided in Iowa Code section 17A.8(6). 1822 FILED IAB 1/17/18 PUBLIC SAFETY DEP AR TMENT[661](cont'd) Effective Date This rule making will become ef fective on February 21, 2018, at which time the Adopted and Filed Emer gency rule making is hereby rescinded.
