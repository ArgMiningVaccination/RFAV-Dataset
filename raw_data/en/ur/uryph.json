A simpler and more streamlined style should be considered. Thank you for this comment. We have streamlined the \"Results\" section to make the report more reader - friendly. For each population, we collapsed the separate sections on \"systematic reviews\" and \"primary studies \" into a single section. We have also combined the 2 separate tables on systematic review and primary study findings into a single table. 3 3 Yes None 4 4 Yes None Is there any indication of bias in our synthesis of the evidence? 4 1 No None 5 2 No None 6 3 No None 7 4 Yes - The authors' explanation for excluding relevant studies were not satisfactory. The need to conduct a rapid synthesis does not preclude the authors from considering all available and relevant evidence. Since this approach already skipped some steps by focusing only on gaps that were found in existing systematic reviews and some systematic reviews are a few years old, it seems reasonable to expect the authors to have at least included all the relevant publications that they found. For the 17 SRs we included but d id not prioritiz e, we have added a brief explanation of our prioritization rationale to the Results section. Most often, these SRs were not prioritized because they were already included in a prioritized revi ew of reviews (Ata -Ali 2020), or their PICOS were covered by a more recent or more relevant review. For transparency, we have also added a table to the Supplementary Materials to provide a list of the 17 non-prioritized SRs along with a specific rationale for why each was not discussed in the report.

If applicable, ple ase indicate the page and line numbers from the draft report. 28 1 Well constructed, well written review. Thank you 29 1 Key findings p. 5 clear Thank you 30 1 Note: Conceptually, periodontal health is achieved through dx, initial treatment, and ONGOING periodontal care (every 3-6 months). Therefore, the optimal effect may be missed by included studies. PERIODIC, RECURRING treatment is key to periodontal maintenance, thus studies with beneficial effects for 3- 6 months is probably the most we can get unless the treatment is continued long term. We have added 2 sentences to the \"Discussion\" section to indicate why changes to chronic disease indicators may only be short term: \"This may be due to the fact that periodontal treatment is meant to be a continuous preventive intervention (ie , scaling and root planing followed by routine check -ups and addressing subsequent problems that arise). Therefore, a single periodontal treatment session or group of sessions may not be sufficient to improve chronic disease indicators long-term.\" 31 2 Thank you for asking me to comment on this Evidence Synthesis document. The literature in is this still -emerging field is not easily summarized, due to the lack of long- term studies and heterogeneity of study design. Nevertheless, the intriguing potential of this body of work, specifically improved health outcomes for patients with certain chronic diseases associated with the provision of preventive dental/periodontal care, makes this an important area of interprofessi onal research. Here are my comments: None 32 2 1. Certain statements in the 'Key Findings' are problematic. While the data suggest that preventive care is associated with improved lung function and reduced frequency of exacerbations, it is stated that it is not clear if these improvements translate into reductions in health care utilization and costs. Certainly the first sentence implies reduced health care utilization. As stated in the Summary We revised the key findings to include the evidence supporting specific statements. Given one of our newly included studies reported those with COPD who receive periodontal treatment have lower medical costs than those who don't receive treatment, we removed the clause about healthcare utilization and costs. While we agree endothelial function is an important outcome, the Evidence Brief: Detection and Treatment of Dental Problems Evidence Synthesis Program 52 Comment # Reviewer # Comment Author Response and Discussion, this phrase appears to be based on one short -term study. a amore specific statement is needed. As for CVD, a report by Tonetti et al (NEJM 2007 PMID 17329698), as well as other literature, has noted improvement in endothelial cell function associated with periodontal treatment. These findings provide additional supporting evidence that are at least as important as the reduction in inflammatory cytokines that are mentioned. Tonetti stud y you cite was not conducted in those with chronic diseases, and none of our other included studies report this outcome. One of our newly included studies does measure oxidative stress, so this is now included in the report. 33 2 2. The evidence of an association of diabetes and periodontitis/periodontal treatment is the strongest of the 4 chronic diseases included in this review. One area of investigation that is of interest is research demonstrating reduced health utilization and costs associated with preventive dental care. These studies utilize existing insurance databases and the first of the published studies (Jeffcoat M et al (Am J Prev Med 2014 PMID 24953519; ref #57) examined four chronic diseases, but has been criticized based on methodological concerns (Sheiham A, J Evid Based Dent Pract 2015 PMID 25666581). Other studies on this subject have focused on diabetes, and the Smits study is cited (ref # 52). Further, another study specifically focused on diabetes is not cited (Nasseh K et al 2017 Health Econ PMID 26799518). In general, for all such studies a major problem is the failure to account for confounding variables. This can be due to a variety of reasons, including the use of existing insurance databases that do not contain all relevant vari ables. We have added Nasseh 2017 to the report. We previously discussed the limitations of Jeffcoat 2014 (ref #57) - including the fact that their control group consisted of patients who have had 1, 2, or 3 periodontal treatment visits (not 0 visits), wh ich is one of the major criticisms raised by Sheiham 2015. Additionally, in our \"Limitations\" section, we previously commented that a major limitation of our included non- RCTs is the \" high risk that confounders could have influenced results.\" 34 2 3. The inability to access the grey literature is mentioned, yet perhaps further elaboration is needed for completeness. There is a significant amount of grey literature ('reports\") in the area of preventive dental services and improved health outcomes. These have been prepared by insurance companies as well as in one case by a health care consulting company, funded by a dental service organization. Interesting to note that some insurance companies have decided to offer expanded preventive dental benefits to en rollees with certain chromic We have reviewed potentially relevant grey literature from insurance care companies suggested by reviewer #1 (see comments #9, #12 & #14) and included studies when they met inclusion criteria. Evidence Brief: Detection and Treatment of Dental Problems Evidence Synthesis Program 53 Comment # Reviewer # Comment Author Response diseases (i.e. diabetes, CVD). 35 2 4. No mention is made in the report of specific periodon tal bacteria that have been shown to play a role in these associations. Porphyromonas gingivalis is one bacterium that has been widely implicated in these associations, and presents with a range of virulence factors that should be discussed when mechanisms are reviewed. We have added porphyromonas gingivalis as an example of bacteria that may be involved in the relation between periodontal disease and chronic diseases to the \"Background\" section. 36 4 General Comments: Overall, I found the study very focus ed and interesting to read. I believe that the authors were very clear about what they intended to accomplish and laid out their rationale for the study in a succinct manner. They also clearly acknowledged the limitations of the study. Thank you 37 4 Specific Comments: Key Findings/ Executive Summary: My first impression of the key findings box was that the authors appeared equivocal/ambiguous in their conclusions. The use of words/phrases such as \"unclear\", \"may improve\" repeatedly, connotes a lack of confidence about the findings or their conclusions. Could it be that the results are unclear because of the rapid approach to synthesizing the evidence? My fear is that this uncertainty will leave a similar impression on the policy makers who are the intended audience for this report. The review of the evidence should help the readers lean one way or the other, otherwise it does not add much value to the body of knowledge or the decision -making process. We have removed the ambiguous language when it was used inappropriately (ie, for findings based on moderate or high -quality strength of evidence). However, we left in this language when we made statements based on low or insufficient strength of evidence. It is important that readers have a sense of our level of confidence based on how we frame our results. To that end, we have added information on the underlying studies supporting specific statements so readers can see why we had low levels of certainty. 38 4 Introduction/ Background: I found it sufficient . The purpose, scope, key questions, and eligibility criteria were clearly laid out. Some minor suggestions: Ln 53, Page 2: Please add a reference about who made this hypothesis. Figure 2: KQ4 should include the treatment arm, for those who received treatment for their dental problems Thank you. Regarding p. 2, line 53- it is difficult to track down who first made this hypothesis, so instead we've rephrased the sentence to say periodontal disease \"may contribute to worsening of diseases whose etiology or severity are in part driven by chronic inflammation\" and provided 2 references that discuss this possible relationship. Evidence Brief: Detection and Treatment of Dental Problems Evidence Synthesis Program 54 Comment # Reviewer # Comment Author Response Regarding figure 2 - we have revised the figure so that KQ4 encompasses the treatment arm as well. 39 4 Methods: Ln 9, Page 7: Spell out acronyms in full at first mention. e.g CDSR Added full name of CDSR (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews). 40 4 Ln 20, Page 7: Why did the authors choose to limit the search of primary studies to only address the gaps found with the systematic reviews? Since some of the systematic reviews are at least a few years old, it would have made for a more robust report if all recent primary studies were included in the synthesis. It would have also helped to have a quantitative synthesis/ meta- analys is for the conditions where no systematic reviews were found. i.e. COPD and cerebrovascular disease. Ultimately, we chose to only search for primary studies that addressed gaps in SR evidence due to 2 factors - 1) there were several moderate and high- qualit y SRs that addressed several of our PICOs of interest and 2) the review was a rapid product and was to be completed i n a short time frame. However, in response to this comment, we have added a search for primary studies on CVD/diabetes & chronic disease indicators from 2019 - 2020. This will ensure we've captured studies published since the end date of our most recent, relevant SRs' searches. To your second point about meta- anal ysis- we added a statement in the \"synthesis of data\" section to explain that w e did not conduct a meta- analysis specifically among those with COPD or cerebrovascular disease because of variability in study designs, outcome measurements, and timing of outcome timing. 41 4 Ln 44, Page 7: Please provide a detailed description of the \"checking\" and consensus process throughout the report. Did the second reviewer review a sample of the initial reviewer's list, the entire selection, or just the ones where there were disagreements? We have clarified that all titles, abs tract and full text articles were reviewed by one investigator and checked by another. Evidence Brief: Detection and Treatment of Dental Problems Evidence Synthesis Program 55 Comment # Reviewer # Comment Author Response 42 4 Ln 50, Page 7: What was the rationale for prioritizing recent studies? Why did the authors not consider all relevant studies that met their criteria? If the time period was important, then why wasn't it included in the eligibility criteria? What was the time cutoff point used to determine if a study was recent? It isn't clearly stated. Our prioritization process only applied to SRs. We did not have a strict cut -off point to determine what was a \"recent\" review. Instead, we started with the most recently published reviews and moved backwards in time to see if older reviews' PICOs were already covered by more recent reviews, or if they offered unique information that should be discussed in the report. We added a sentence to the \"results\" section to describe the reasons why we did not discuss those 17 non- prioritized SRs, and also added a table to the Supplementary Materials with a specific reason why each SR was not prioritized. 43 4 Results: I strongly feel that the ambiguity of the results are due to the limitations in the approach. An exhaustive search of primary studies for each of these topics, might have yielded more evidence that would have helped to increase the certainty of the authors' conclusions. By focusing on the gaps found with the systematic reviews and not updating the systematic reviews with findings from more recent studies, the authors might have limited their own ability to make more definitive statements. Given the availability of multiple, moderate or high - quality SRs on the effect of periodontal therapy on chronic disease indicators for those with CVD and diabetes, we believe it was appropriate to focus our report on those SRs' results and only run a search for studies on gaps in evidence. However, in response to this and earlier comments, we have added a search for primary studies on the effect of periodontal therapy on chronic disease outcomes for those with CVD or diabetes published from 2019 - 2020 to ensure we've captured all the most recently published studies on this topic. 44 4 List of Excluded Studies: I recommend reconsidering some of these studies for inclusion in the synthesis. It is unclear what criteria was used to determine \"E5\", \"E7\", and \"E8\". \"R\" and \"E9\" are not defined in the legend. Thank you for pointing this out - the study labeled \"R\" was an include and was erroneously added in the excluded table. E9 (outdated or ineligible review) has been added to the tabl e. We have also added our full inclusion/exclusion criteria as an additional appendix in the Supplementary Materials for full transparency.
