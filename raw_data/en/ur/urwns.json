From By Emma Read, DVM, MVSc, DACVS Ah, the good old days...when new graduates came to us completely prepared and ready to start their new job; when students and new graduates worked all night without com-plaining and asked for very little pay; and when graduates stayed in equine for the rest of their career, bought into the practice and never left to pursue other opportunities. We all remember the good old days, right? Personally, I am not sure I ever saw them, but I have heard an awful lot about them over the years\u2014that golden time when all was good in the world. Kind of like travel used to be before COVID-19 came along. Twenty years ago, as I finished my residency, I first heard colleagues say that all the issues in equine practice with retention of younger practitioners could be solved if only we had much better graduates. Ouch. It was pointed out that if veterinary schools spent more time recruiting better candidates and then trained them to be more resilient, or if practices and internships spent more time focusing on technical skills and making them into better practitioners, then we would have more suitable colleagues who would purchase practices and remain in the profession while giving it their all. As one who has spent parts of the last 20 years in private practice, academia and administration, I've been immersed in this issue from all sides. I've heard the criticisms and questions from all corners of the profession. Given the urgency of equine veterinarians leaving equine practice, it's time to refocus our approach around a fresh and unified response. I'm currently reading \"The Burnout Epidemic: The Rise of Chronic Stress and How We Can Fix It\" by Jennifer Moss. The author states that there are six factors that inevitably lead to burnout in workers, no matter the industry. I recognize most or all these as being problematic for many of our new graduates in the equine profession, whether they enter practice right away or more typically, and especially, while they work in an internship. The factors are: 1. Heavy workload 2. Perceived lack of control over their own workload or schedule (especially on call) 3. Lack of rewards or recognition for work done 4. Poor relationships at work and outside of work (no time for others) 5. Lack of fairness (bias, favoritism, mistreatment, or unfair compensation) 6. Values mismatch (Perceived overqualification. The graduate expects a job that uses their credentials and skills but instead finds themselves in a job that leaves them feeling deprived.) For as long as I can recall, the conversation has always been about the loss of the good old days and what can we do to fix the kids who are coming along today. The students. The graduates. The young people. They are the ones who need to change to fit our mold. Well, the hard cold truth is that they are not the problem. We are the ones who must change. If we don't change us, then we will continue the pain point where practices can't hire enough doctors and where retaining them becomes ever more problematic. We simply don't have many students to recruit, we don't have enough graduates to hire, and the ones we are able to convince to give us a try continue to leave in droves\u2014half of them by the 5-year mark. Putting better students into a broken model will still result in them being broken, disillusioned and ultimately leaving. We need to stop talking and start listening. All of us: practitioners, colleges and organizations! The AAEP did a lot of listening last year. Dr. Carol Clark and Dr. Rob Trimble headed a task force that listened to more than 50 equine practitioners describe their current challenges. The board of directors heard that feedback at our December meeting in Nashville. Panel sessions at the annual convention opened our eyes and ears to the voices that were speaking loudly about the pain that is happening every day in practice. At our board meeting in January, we continued to determine our operation plan for the upcoming year. We agreed unanimously that this is the most pressing issue our organization faces. We all have a role to play in finding the solutions. In the next few months, we will be convening a summit meeting of practitioners to discuss the retention task force findings and to strategize about solutions that involve changing us, not them. We will also convene a task force to take a deeper dive into internships and the AAEP's role in this space. Lastly, we want to understand how to best support and mentor our young colleagues. What is it that they need? This is not us offering them advice about how to be more like we want them to be; rather, it is us listening and learning. It is us finding out what it will take for them to want to ride with us and stay there so they can buy our practices, take care of our clients and look after their horses. The biggest question that remains is whether all of us are up for this challenge. Can we listen to the new graduates and students and start to consider how we can change our mindsets? Do we have it in us to listen, learn and adapt before it is too late? If we continue to do nothing, all we may have left are the memories of the good old days.Dr. Emma Read IV AAEP News March 2022Associ Ation Associ Ation The AAEP board convened Jan. 18 for its winter meeting with all directors present\u2014one by videoconference. Following is a synopsis of the meeting. After opening remarks by AAEP President Dr. Emma Read, the board commenced discussion of the strategic plan with the goal of developing operational objectives for the year. Deliberation about The Profession goal focused on the retention effort. The board split into three groups to begin work on defining and measuring success for each demographic group\u2014students, new graduates and practice owners. Specific actions taken were approval of motions to: form a task force to plan a Practice Owner Strategy Summit (or regional summits) in which invited practice owner representatives participate in a facili - tated discussion of potential AAEP action based on data gathered thus far. Dr. Jim Zeliff will chair this task force. form a task force on internships to examine the internship process and make recommended changes, if warranted. Areas of consideration include rating systems, AAEP certification, best practices, and a review of models from other professions. Drs. Jackie Christakos and Sarah Reuss will jointly chair this task force. consider Peer Group formation with Decade One program founder Dr. Amy Grice, who has discussed with several Decade One participants the potential scalability of the program to accommodate larger numbers as well as inclusion of students as an entry point. Dr. Grice will present a proposal to the board for consideration. The board wrapped up The Profession goal with a brief discussion of student programs, including the possibility of developing a speaker's bureau and practitioner advisor program for each chapter. No formal action was taken on this particular initiative. It will be revisited at the summer board meeting. A report on The Education goal revealed that the bulk of the initial strategies had been accomplished; however, the Educational Programs Committee intends to meet in-person this summer to re-evaluate AAEP's educational programming based on lessons learned during the pandemic and how that might shape future programs. Key areas of focus are continued improvements in the Annual Convention and increasing both the virtual catalogue of offerings as well as hands-on learning opportunities.Discussions around The Horse goal included an update on Scope of Practice plans as well as potential owner education via webinars and social media, including raising awareness among horse owners of the retention issues facing the profession. The strategic plan portion of the meeting concluded with approval of the recommendations presented by the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Task Force, which includes formation of a standing committee on DEI. The board then received an update from The Foundation for the Horse, specifically related to its comprehensive campaign and the work of its research working group. Specific actions taken included approval of motions: to approve the research working group's strategic planning process and recommendations. for the board to approve grant disbursements for research and other areas; however, for emergency funding associated with disasters, the disaster medicine working group is authorized to approve requests up to $50,000. Requests exceeding that amount require board approval. The meeting's focus then shifted to general association issues. The board approved an increase of $25 in annual membership dues for the 2022-23 membership year. This is the first increase in seven years. Following a discussion of the AAEP leadership program that was reinstated last October, the board approved a motion that AAEP LEAD be conducted annually each fall with approximately 10 to 12 invited individuals. The Member Engagement Committee will continue to be involved with applicant selection and post-seminar placement of attendees in volunteer roles; and will be tasked with developing additional volunteer opportunities for attendees. AAEP will continue to work with the Veterinary Leadership Initiative for curriculum development and will solicit input from attendees of the most recent seminar to ensure relevancy. The board then addressed work group recommendations. Specific actions taken were: approval of separate recommendations from the Finance Committee to (1) re-appoint Mr. Drew Buechley and Mr. Eric Krawitt to one-year terms as ex-officio members of the committee, and (2) appoint Mr. John Chalk to an advisory role to the committee for 2022. approval of separate recommendations from the Racing Committee to (1) convene an in-person strategic planning session in 2022, and (2) assign the committee chair or their designee to serve on the board of the Racing Officials Accreditation Program, which offered AAEP a seat on its board. The next board meeting will be July 25 in Lexington, Ky.Retention strategies materialize at winter board meeting By David Foley, AAEP Executive Director David Foley New Practice Life podcast spotlights retention, internship issuesAAEP News March 2022 V AssociAtionAssociAtion During the February episode of the AAEP Practice Life podcast, entitled, \"AAEP Leadership Chat: What's Coming in 2022?\" Dr. Mike Pownall hosts a wide-ranging discussion of important association and industry issues with 2022 AAEP President Dr. Emma Read, President-Elect Dr. Rob Franklin and Executive Director David Foley. Among the topics addressed during the 42-minute episode are examining internship standards and retention issues, engaging veterinary students with an equine interest, promoting the benefits of equine practice, addressing scope of practice issues, and reflecting on other AAEP activities.Commenting on the recent creation of a task force on internships to address concerns with the internship process and system, David Foley said, \"The first question they'll want to ask is 'What is the AAEP's role in the whole internship process? What can we do to improve that situation?' It'll probably be a deconstruction of the current Avenues program and then building it back to hopefully be better suited to interns and to practices.\" To hear more, download or listen to the episode at podcast.aaep.org or on iTunes.

Among the primary revisions are a change to \"above 101.5\u00b0 F\" for a tempera-ture to be considered a fever, which is consistent with regulatory agencies and with other AAEP resources; updated resources on Integrated Pest Management; and updated guidelines that clarify the role of regulatory involvement in outbreak situations. The guidelines document is published as a PDF file and incorporates comprehensive information and step-by-step biosecurity protocols and recommendations in three distinct areas: identification of key personnel, important contacts and reference materials; routine biosecurity protocol; and outbreak response. Links to additional resources are also available. Visit aaep.org/document/general-biosecurity-guidelines to view the updated guidelines or save them to your phone or tablet for future reference. Additional biosecurity informa-tion specific to common situations and locations such as breeding operations, events and travel are available from the Equine Disease Communication Center through the \"Biosecurity\" link at equinediseasecc.org.Updated General Biosecurity Guidelines available on AAEP's website EDCC receives federal grant to promote biosecurity awareness The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC), working with the AAEP, has been awarded a cooperative agreement from USDA-APHIS National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program (NADPRP) for $176,960 to increase awareness of biosecurity and help prevent the spread of infectious diseases in horses. With the NADPRP support, the EDCC will develop tools to improve disease recognition and practical biosecurity while communicating the importance of biosecurity to all horse industry constituents. This will include creation of user-friendly biosecurity information and procedures for distribution throughout the horse community using media and the network of horse organizations and allied industry. The EDCC will also provide ongoing sources of continuing education for distribution by veterinarians to their clients. Horses are transported more than any other livestock to horse shows, racetracks, sales, breeding farms and inter - national events, creating an increased risk for infectious disease spread within the United States. To decrease this risk, all industry participants\u2014from horse owners to event managers\u2014need to be aware of the need for increased biosecurity and how to use it to mitigate diseases when they occur. To assess the industry's current level of knowledge, the EDCC will complete a survey of horse owners and veterinarians. \"Dealing with Covid-19 has highlighted the need for bios- ecurity procedures to reduce risk of infection; however, most horse owners are still not fully aware of the threat to their horses from both endemic and foreign animal diseases either at home or when traveling,\" said Dr. Nathaniel White, EDCC director. \"We need to understand the gaps in biosecurity knowledge. Armed with that information, we will create specific plans for facilities and events, enabling the industry to react to domestic and foreign disease threats.\" All facets of the horse industry (owners, producers, veteri- narians and allied industry) will benefit from the continuing education information and biosecurity templates created during this project. Dr. White and Katie McDaniel, EDCC's communication manager, will work with the AAEP's Infectious Disease Committee to create \"how-to\" plans and resources which will be available on the EDCC website. These tools will help owners and vet-erinarians decrease disease risks during horse shows, events, race meets, breeding operations, pleasure horse activities and travel. Infographic designs for signage, visual aids and presentations will be made available through the EDCC, supporting member organizations and allied companies. \"This is the first NADPRP grant awarded for an equine- focused project,\" said Kentucky State Veterinarian Dr. Katie Flynn. \"This is exciting news for the equine industry as the funding will dedicate resources to advancing biose-curity within the equine community. Promoting everyday biosecurity will have significant benefit to the health and welfare of our horses as well as ensuring the economic health of the industry.\" Associ Ation Associ Ation Dr. Nat WhiteVIII AAEP News March 2022 The benefits to your physical and emotional wellbeing accrued from a healthy disconnect from work when off the clock can boost your focus, engagement and enjoyment of veterinary medicine when on the clock\u2014even when it's your turn to respond to a late-night emergency. Establishment, communication and enforcement of clear and effective boundaries is essential to minimizing client infringement on your personal time. To help prevent clients from creeping into your leisure time, following are several client boundary-setting suggestions from members compiled from a recent association podcast and from responses to a question that appeared in the February 1 issue of the Spur e-newsletter. A blanket ban on client texts As her Woodside, Calif., practice started to grow and expand, Dr. Kelly Zeytoonian instituted a no-texting policy with clients that has streamlined correspondence between the practice and clients and helped ensure that practitioners can enjoy their days off free from client contact. She explained the rationale for the policy during the January 2022 episode of the AAEP Practice Life podcast. \"There are so many other forms of communication coming in that we'd be setting ourselves up for an onslaught of messages or a missed communication where somebody feels like we haven't taken care of them,\" said Dr. Zeytoonian. \"I think that's been a great way to allow myself and allow the employees to know that when we're off, we're off.\" Using technology to protect time off Similarly, Dr. Yana Sorokurs of Sonoma, Calif., does not give out her cell phone number to clients. Instead, clients must call the practice and can only reach her when she is on duty. During her off times, clients trying to reach her will be helped by someone else in the practice. \"I only give out my work phone number and extension, never my personal cell number,\" she said. \"We use the Grasshopper app for the extensions, and it is set to only forward to my cell during business hours.\" Grasshopper (and similar apps and services) funnels calls and texts through the practice phone number, which maintains the privacy of practitioner cell phone numbers and helps foster a healthy separation between practice and personal life. Calls and/or texts to clients from a practitioner's cell phone will display as coming from the practice phone number.The power of auto-reply Ambulatory veterinarians often give their cell phone number to clients, which creates a prime opportunity for after-hours, non-emergency texts from clients. Dr. Melissa Kelson of Denville, N.J., simply set up an auto-reply on her phone to manage incoming texts. The auto-reply alerts texters of the number to call for an emergency and that responses to all other inquiries will occur during regular office hours. \"That way I don't feel guilty about not getting back to them until the next working day, and they know not to expect an instant reply,\" said Dr. Kelson. \"It also helps when I'm on call as it prompts those who would normally text me an emergency to call me instead, thus stopping me from constantly having to check for messages. I have all notifications on my phone turned off for my sanity\u2014the only noise my phone makes is for an incoming phone call.\" Dr. Kelson said her personal texting tends to occur via Facebook Messenger so her use of auto-reply has little impact on her personal correspondence. She also doesn't associate with clients on her personal social media. Befriending clients on social media can blur the line between client and friend, potentially leading clients to think of you as a friend and act as such by disregarding established boundaries. Client boundaries are an individual decision so you must decide what is important to you and then advocate those choices to clients. When it comes to after-hours communi-cation, it is important that clients are informed of a course of action for reporting emergencies as well as a timeframe for responses to non-emergent calls and texts.Establishing boundaries to minimize 'client creep'WELL nEss continUinG EDUcAtion Provide your sport horse clients with a thorough evaluation of their potential purchase by applying protocols and skills acquired at the AAEP's Focus on Sport Horse Pre-Purchase Exam, May 2-3 in Lexington, Ky.

One eye was treated with 0.15-mg dexamethasone disodium phosphate (0.1%), and the other eye was treated with 1.5-mg prednisolone acetate (1%). Serum samples were taken prior to of general anaesthesia. Aqueous and vitreous humour samples weretaken during euthanasia at time points after administration of the last dose ( t=5 min, t=15 min, t=30 min, t=60 min, t=90 min, t=120 min and t=180 min). Each pony was randomly assigned to one time point, and three ponies were sampled per time point. Dexamethasone and prednisolone concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. The mean /C6standard deviation (SD) dexamethasone concentration in aqueous was 32.4 mean concentration was 321.6/C696.0 ng/ml. In vitreous and serum samples, concentrations of both corticosteroids were below the limit of detection (LOD 2.5 ng/ml). Potentially effective dexamethasone and prednisolone concentrations were measured in the anterior chamber, but vitreal concentrations were negligible and systemic uptake was low. Therefore, treatment with only topically administered corticosteroids is deemed insuf cient in horses in cases of posterior uveitis. Fluid therapy after colic surgery This study by Gessica Giusto and co-workers in Italycompared goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) and 'liberal' fluid regimens (LFRs) in horses undergoing small intestinal surgery . Eighteen horses subjected to small intestinal surgery were matched according to the surgical lesion, type of anastomosis, length of resection and duration of clinical signs. Horses in the LFR group were administered intravenous (IV) fluids for at least 24 h. In the GDFT group, IVfluids were administered only when considered necessary based on clinical parameters. Post-operative re flux (POR), packed cell volume, total protein, heart rate, venouslactate level, complications and long-term survival rates were compared. Three horses in the LFR and one in the GDFT group developed POR. Horses in the GDFT group had a shorter time interval to rst oral water intake and shorter hospitalisation time. Post-operative complication rates andsurvival were not different between groups. Further studies are necessary to set guidelines for the evaluation of hydration status and to plan post-operative fluid administration; however, GDFT may be a valid alternative toliberal fluid therapy after colic surgery.Hybrid jejuno-ileo-caecal anastomosis In this case study, Marco Gandini and Gessica Giusto ,based in Italy, performed a combination of end-to-end jejuno-ilealanastomosis and side-to-side horses (3 geldings, 2 mares and 2 stallions) were examined because of acute colic caused by small intestinal obstruction involving the aborad portion of the jejunum and orad portion of the ileum. All horses underwent a routine colic examination on arrival and had a diagnosis of strangulating obstruction of the small intestine. All horses underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy, in which the affected aborad portion of the jejunum andorad portion of the ileum wascombined with a to produce a hybrid jejuno-ileo-caecal anastomosis. In two horses, the hand-sewn end-to-end combined with a half-stapled, half-hand-sewn incomplete ileocaecal bypass. The procedures restored continuity of the small intestine with partial bypass of the ileocaecal valve. All horses survived to hospital discharge, and none developed colic or ileus during the post-operative period. Follow-up revealed that six horses were living and had no subsequent signs of colic (4 -17 months after surgery), and one was subjected to euthanasia because of colic17 months after surgery. Results for these horses suggested the hybrid jejuno-ileo- caecal anastomosis could be considered as an option for the resolution of small intestinal strangulating lesions involving the orad portion of the ileum. Studies are needed to assess short- and long-term effects of the procedure in horses. Gastrointestinal treatments This study by Rebecca Bishop and co-workers in the USA aimed to establish the ef cacy of sucralfate or omeprazole used prophylactically in a combined feed-fast and nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drug protocol . with equine gastric disease (EGGD) and equine squamous gastric disease (ESGD) scores 2 endoscopy ( n=14), received either omeprazole (1 mg/kg per os q. 24 h) or sucralfate (20 mg/kg per os q. 8 h) while undergoing the feed-fast/NSAID protocol (alternating 24-h periods of feed and fasted for 7 days, and 5 days of 1.1 mg/ kgflunixin meglumine IV q. 12 h), were allowed an 8-week washout period and then administered the alternatetreatment. Serial gastroscopy (Days 2, 4 and 7), ultrasound and haematology documented treatment effects. ESGD and EGGD scores increased over time under both treatments. There was a signi cant effect of treatment on EGGD scores, with post-treatment EGGD scores higher 1,1). scores just achieved signi cance, with superior to sucralfate for mitigating gastric lesion severity in healthy horses exposed to a feed-fast/NSAID model. Seasonal effects on enteric pathogens In this study, Jaclyn Willette and co-workers investigated theeffects of season and geographic location on the detection of nucleic acids of potential enteric pathogens (PEPs) or their toxins (PEP-Ts) in faeces of horses 6 months old in the United States . Results of 3343 equine diarrhoea PCR panels submitted to IDEXX Laboratories for horses 6 months old were reviewed. Submission months were grouped into four seasons, andstates were grouped into four geographic regions. Logistic regression was performed to assess effects of season and region on detection rates of PEPs and PEP-Ts. Agresti-Coull CIs were determined. The detection rate of Salmonella enterica was higher in the South in summer compared to all in other regions and was also higher in the South in fall than in the Midwest and Northeast. The Neorickettsia risticii detection rate was lower during summer in the West and higher in fall in the Midwest.The detection of Cryptosporidium spp. was lower during spring, summer and winter in the West. Differences were notidenti ed for detection from this study support seasonal and regional differences indetection rates of S. enterica ,N. risticii and Cryptosporidium spp. in horses 6 months old in the United States. Parasagittal groove changes in Thoroughbreds This study by Georgina Johnston and co-workers in Australiainvestigated imaging and gross parasagittal groove (PSG) ndings in racing Thoroughbreds and the comparative use of different imaging modalities to detect PSG changes . Cadaver limbs were collected from 20 deceased racing/training Thoroughbreds. All fetlocks were examinedusing radiography, low- eld magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), contrast arthrographyand gross pathology. Horses with fetlock fracture were more likely to have lateromedial PSG sclerosis asymmetry and/or lateral PSG lysis. PSG lysis was not readily detected using MRI. PSG subchondral bone defects were dif cult to differentiate from cartilage defects on MRI and were not associated withfractures. The clinical relevance of PSG STIR hyperintensity remains unclear. Overall, radiography was poor for detecting PSG changes. Some PSG changes in Thoroughbred racehorses are common; however, certain ndings are more prevalent in horses with fractures, possibly indicating microdamageaccumulation. Bilateral advanced imaging is recommended in racehorses with suspected fetlock pathology. Plantar fasciotomy and neurectomy This study by Alexandra Scharf and co-workers in the USA aimed to determine the short-term effect of plantar fasciotomy and neurectomy (PFN) of the deep branch of the lateral plantar nerve on the proximal suspensory ligament(PSL) and cross-sectional proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) Records of horses with PSD treated by PFN were included if a preoperative, and at least one post-operative, ultrasonographic examination was available. One masked observer measured the ultrasonographic cross-sectional area (CSA) of the PSL. Intraobserver reliability was determined by repeatedly measuring a subset of 127 ultrasonographic images. Two masked observers measured the CSA of the PSL (PSL-CSA) on preoperative proton density (PD)-weighted transverse high- eld magnetic resonance images of 19 horses. Agreements for PSL-CSA between preoperativeultrasonographic and MRI measures and between the two MRI observers were assessed. Follow-up considered the horses ' ability to return to exercise and their owners 'satisfaction. The reliability of the ultrasonographic measurement of the PSL-CSA was excellent. Agreement betweenultrasonographic assessment and MRI assessment of PSL-CSA was good. No difference was detected between preoperative and post-operative PSL-CSAs. At a median of 12 months (4 -33 months), 16/20 owners reported the horse was 'better 'and 15/20 functioned at or above preoperative levels. Ultrasonographic measurement of the PSL-CSA was reproducible and in good agreement with MRI measurement. The PSL-CSA was not in fluenced by PFN and cannot be used to guide return to function. S.

Journal of Veterinary Diagnostic Investigation MARCH 2022Case Report Successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in an adult horse following cardiovascular collapse on recovery from generalanaesthesia in the Trendelenburg position M. Duggan*, mare was admitted to Lisadell Equine Hospital for surgical repair of a chronic, 10 cm long ventral laceration of the cervix. The mare was not known to have any underlying health issues and was assigned an ASA status of 1. Premedication was performed with acepromazine , xylazine and butorphanol. General anaesthesia was induced with ketamine and diazepam and the mare was positioned in dorsal recumbency. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. The mare was mechanically ventilated. After routine aseptic preparation, the mare was transitioned to Trendelenburg position for the surgical procedure. A variable rate infusion of dobutamine was administered and MAP maintained between 72 -75 mmHg for the majority of the anaesthetic duration. Followingcompletion of the surgical procedure, the mare was transitioned from Trendelenburg back to dorsal recumbency. The mare was disconnected from the breathing circuit and the endotracheal tube left in place; she was moved to the recovery box and placed in right lateral recumbency. One minute 10 s after positioning in the recovery box, it was notedthat the mare was apnoeic. Clinical examination revealed mydriatic pupils, absent corneal and palpebral re flexes, and absent peripheral pulses. Cardiac auscultation con rmed asystole 3 min 55 s after the mare was placed in the recovery box. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was commenced immediately at 9 -10 breaths/min with tidal volume of 5 L. Simultaneously, thoracic compressions werestarted using the operator 's bodyweight to generate force through dropping of the knee onto the horse 's thorax at a rate of 30 compressions per minute. Monitoring (ECG, RR, SpO 2and EtCO 2) was rapidly re-established and asystole was con rmed on ECG <2 min diagnosis of asystole by auscultation. Intravenous adrenaline (0.002 mg/kg) was administered 2 min 40 s after initial detection of asystole with a following dose of intratracheal adrenaline (0.01 mg/kg) 1 min 30 s later. Thoracic compressions were continued. Five minutes 50 s following initiation of CPR, electrical activity was detected on the ECG; weak, rhythmic beats were audible on auscultation and thoracic compressions were then discontinued. There was a weak peripheral pulse palpable. An intravenous bolus of 5 L isotonic solution was administered, and a dobutamine constant rate infusion (0.002 mg/kg/min) started once a heartbeat had been detected, to increasemyocardial contractility. At this point, the mare wasbradycardic (24 beats/min) with a sinus rhythm. Despite return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and EtCO 2ranging from 30 to 40 mmHg during IPPV, the mare did not start tobreathe spontaneously, and pupils remained centrally xed and mydriatic. Dexamethasone was administered (0.09 mg/ kg, i.v. bwt) in a single dose. Corneal re flexes slowly reappeared within 10 -15 min after ROSC and the heart rate gradually increased to 28 beats/min. The exact time when spontaneous breathing resumed was not recorded; it followed the return of corneal re flexes and a reduction in IPPV rate to 4 -6 breaths/min. On return of spontaneous respiration, IPPV was ceased. Approximately 50 min after ROSC, the mare had mild nystagmus and showed signs of movement. Dobutamine and IV fluid supplementation were discontinued. After approximately 80 min from ROSC, themare positioned herself in sternal recumbency. Following 20 min and three failed attempts at standing, a stable stance was achieved. The following morning the mare was bright, alert and responsive with normal vital parameters and a good appetite. The mare is currently clinically well with no ill effects noted 6 months after discharge from the hospital. The mare has been covered, but has not conceived. Key points \u0081The aetiopathogenesis of cardiovascular collapse in anaesthetised equines is complex with many contributing factors. Proper monitoring during general anaesthesia is of utmost importance to detect and prevent cardiopulmonary arrest. \u0081Ensuring airway patency, adequate ventilation andcirculatory support is necessary for successful CPR. Thoracic compressions are effective in maintaining circulation even in adult Thoroughbreds at an optimum rate of 80 compressions per minute (CPM), although a rate of 30 CPM was successful in this case. \u0081Chronotropic and inotropic drugs are valuable in CPRparticularly adrenaline, although the literature recommends varying doses for horses, with no current gold standard. \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd116 10.1111/eve.13453_1IT STARTS WITHIN .

US-EQU-0025-2022MASTERPIECE.Clinical Commentary REassessment Campaign On VEterinary Resuscitation: Has the time come for horses? L. Chiavaccini Department of Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA Corresponding author email: lchiavac@ncsu.edu Keywords: horse; cardiopulmonary arrest; is disconcerting that equine anaesthetic-related fatalities for elective procedures are nearly 10- to 20-fold more frequent than their small animal counterparts, and between 100- and1000-fold more likely than human anaesthesia-associated fatalities (Brodbelt et al . 2008; Li et al . 2016; Laurenza et al . 2019). Approximately one-third of these fatalities come from cardiac arrest or post-operative cardiovascular collapse. The lack of a solid understanding of anaesthetic-related outcomes, the unlikely return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and the dearth of comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations nourish the dread of perioperative cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) among equine practitioners (Bidwell et al . 2007; Muir and Hubbell 2009). Given that perioperative CPA in horses is an uncommon but not extraordinarily rare event, practitioners should be preparedto face this emergency. What stands out from the current literature is the substantial variabilities in equine cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques, that often blend practices echoing the Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society REassessment Campaign On VEterinary Resuscitation (RECOVER) guidelines (Fletcher et al . 2012) with empirical interventions (Conde Ruiz and Junot 2018; Duggan et al. 2022). The RECOVER guidelines, published in the summer of 2012, aimed to systematically review the body of literature on CPRfrom a veterinary standpoint and to generate practical consensus guidelines to be used in dogs and cats. Before RECOVER, there were no consensus guidelines available in veterinary medicine. While the small animal guidelines have been applied to neonatal foals 2016), direct transposition to adult horses can be challenging. Nevertheless, they represent anexcellent starting point, at least for some general concepts. It is futile to try to ascertain the exact cause of the CPA in the report published by Duggan et al . (2022) in this issue. The negligible monitoring during the last 15 min of anaesthesia makes it dif cult to determine the precise moment at which the CPA happened. The authors recognised the arrest whenthe animal was in the recovery stall. Between 30% and 66% of canine and feline perioperative deaths happen in recovery (Brodbelt et al . 2008). Instead, in horses, anaesthesia-related cardiovascular collapse was historically reported to occurearly in the anaesthetic period (Johnston et al . 2002; Dugdale et al . 2016; Dugdale and Taylor 2016) and attributed to the adverse cardiovascular and arrhythmogenic effects of halothane (Johnston et al . 2002; Bidwell et al . 2007). But, adverse intraoperative cardiac events are rare sincehalogenated ether compounds have been introduced in equine anaesthesia (Johnston et al. 2004; Laurenzaet al . 2019). Both in human and small animal medicine, there is excellent evidence that early recognition of CPA is criticalfor successful ROSC (White et al. 2010; Fletcher et al. 2012). As Conde Ruiz and Junot (2018) emphasised, the inevitable lack of accurate monitoring of horses during transportation from the operating room to the recovery stall and during recovery can delay post-operative CPA detection. When CPA happens in the post-operative period, as in Duggan et al . (2022), all the equipment is available, and the horse is likely intubated. However, how many equine practiceskeep essential emergency drugs readily available? (and no, that one dose of lidocaine or N-butylscopolammonium bromide withdrawn ready for use do not count). How many practices expose cognitive aids, such as checklists, algorithm charts and dosing charts in the operating room or the recovery stall? Whenwas the last time you practised a simulated arrest in an adult horse? It has been demonstrated that adherence to CPR guidelines can only be accomplished with regular didactic and psychomotor skills training. We often disguise our deferment behind the belief that any effort for successful CPR in horses is vain (Muir and Hubbell 2009). The report published by Duggan et al. (2022) in this issue proves us wrong. The goal of CPR is to restore blood flow and blood pressure. It is now recognised that chest compressions should be initiated as soon as possible after recognition of the arrest (Kleinman et al . 2015). 'Push hard, push fast ',t h e ys a y .T h o r a c i c compressions delivered at a rate of 80/min to adult horses mayreach a cardiac output (CO) as high as 25 mL/kg/min, about 50% of the CO of an anaesthetised horse (Hubbell et al . 1993), which may be suf cient to maintain vital organs 'perfusion for a brief period. Faster rates may be warranted (Palmer 2007; Fletcher et al . 2012; Kleinman et al . 2015). As both Duggan et al . (2022) and Conde Ruiz and Junot (2018) highlighted, a single operator rapidly thrusting the knee onto the horse chest just behind its elbow is unlikely to reach the frequency of 80 compressions per minute or above, and frequencies closer to30/min are more commonly obtained. From a feasibility perspective, chest compressions in adult horses may be a two- people job. There are two main theories behind the mechanism by which external compressions lead blood flow during CPR: the cardiac pump theory and the thoracic pump theory. In thethoracic pump mechanism, intrathoracic veins and cardiac chambers ll during chest relaxation following the pressure gradient created. During canine CPR, compressions over thewidest portion of the chest are more likely to be effective than direct compressions over the heart in large canine breeds (Fletcher et al . 2012; Hopper et al . 2012). The same may be true for horses, and compressions over the widest portion of thethorax, instead of the area behind the elbow, may allow for \u00a92021 EVJ more ef cient compressions. In an older study, neither intermittent simultaneous ventilation nor alternating abdominal compression improved CO (Hubbell et al . 1993). The other fact to keep in mind is that performing CPR is physically and mentally tiring. The current guidelinesrecommend doing compressions in 2-min cycles in intubated patients, with several alternating rescuers (Fletcher et al . 2012). Personnel shortage may make this guideline challenging inequine anaesthesia practice. In the report by Duggan et al . (2022), a large animal anaesthetic machine readily available allowed starting intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) with 100% oxygen at a rate of 10 breaths/min immediately after compressions. In horses that cannot be intubated, nasotracheal catheters, a temporary tracheostomy or high- frequency jet ventilation, are valid alternatives to maintain arterial oxygenation. While doxapram hydrochloride appeared in older text as a respiratory stimulant to control ventilation after the horse was haemodynamically stable (Muir and Hubbell 2009), its use is no longer advocated. Efcacy of CPR and early recognition of ROSC in the face of constant minute ventilation are best assessed through capnography. While capnography was instituted in this case, end-tidal carbon dioxide was not recorded. The ECG can help identify shockable rhythms and guide Advanced Life Support (ALS), but it should not be used to assess haemodynamics or identify ROSC. When it comes to ALS, there is contrasting and poorly referenced information in the equine literature. Because onlya fraction of normal CO can be achieved even with effective compressions, the administration of low doses of epinephrine every 3 -5 min early in the CPR is recommended to centralise circulation and to guarantee coronary andcerebral perfusion. The use of epinephrine in CPR is a double- edged sword. It is widely used for its a-1 adrenergic activity. In contrast, its b-adrenergic activity is less crucial and may be detrimental in early CPR because of increased myocardial oxygen demand, predisposing to arrhythmias (Fletcher et al . 2012). This effect is exacerbated following blockage of a-adrenergic receptors by a phenothiazine, like in the report by Duggan et al . (2022); the so-called kg of epinephrine intravenously (i.v.) almost 3 min after detecting the CPA. They then followed with 0.01 mg/kg intratracheal dose injected shortly after the rst dose. As the authors recognised, there is currently no evidence ofintratracheal drug administration 's effectiveness that should only be considered in animals in which intravenous access isnot available. The epinephrine doses reported fall within the historic range suggested for horses (Muir and Hubbell 2009), but they are only 10 -20% of the recommended doses for humans, small animals and foals (Fletcher et al . 2012; Kleinman et al . 2015; Hopster Vasopressin (0.4 i.v.), a pure vasoconstrictor acting on V1 receptors,can be used as an alternative or in combination with epinephrine (Muir and Hubbell 2009; Fletcher et al . 2012). There is still mixed evidence on vasopressin 'se f cacy over epinephrine during CPR and none the horse. Unlike epinephrine, vasopressin lacks inotropic and chronotropic effects that may worsen myocardial ischaemia. There is no evidence that atropine sulphate (or other antimuscarinics)improves ROSC, and it should, therefore, be used only if the CPA is associated with increased vagal tone. The use ofdobutamine and other inotropes or vasopressors after ROSC helps patients with cardiovascular instability. Doses of 2 -4 mg/kg of dexamethasone i.v. were historically recommended for treating horses with shock and ischaemia (Muir and Hubbell 2009). However, there is lack of compelling evidence of neuroprotective effects of corticosteroids either in small animals or in human medicine (Paris et al . 1984; Fletcher et al . 2012), in the face of possible harmful effects in case of low organ perfusion. Duggan et al . (2022) administered a bolus of immediately after ROSC and another10 mL/kg bolus after the horse was back in the stall. Older guidelines recommended aggressive fluid therapy during equine resuscitation (Muir and Hubbell 2009), but theyreferred to CPA following acute hypovolaemia or severe dehydration. There is now compelling evidence that the routine use of large volumes of i.v. fluids during CPR or after ROSC in euvolaemic animals may increase central venouspressure and decrease coronary and cerebral perfusion pressure (Fletcher et al . 2012). In conclusion, the RECOVER guidelines 'publication highlighted the knowledge gap that surrounds equine CPR (Jokisalo and Corley 2014). We overlooked the development of a systemic evidence-based approach to equine CPR, thinking that whatever effort we invested was likely to be futile. The case reported by Duggan et al . (2022) in this issue demonstrates that resuscitation can be successful in adulthorses. While there is contrasting evidence whetherimplementing RECOVER consensus guidelines improved CPR in hospitals with an already high ROSC 's rate (Hoehne et al . 2019), their introduction homogenised success rates across small animal hospitals (Kawase et al . 2018). Therefore, we urge the development of updated evidence-basedclinical guidelines for practising CPR in equine patients.

A neurological examination identi ed mild hypermetria in all four limbs. No ataxia was observed, andorthopaedic examination was unremarkable. Due to concerns over reports of intermittent ataxia and the implications for rider safety, the owner elected for the mare to undergo head and cervical spine computed tomography and myelography under general anaesthesia. Computerisedtomography showed the articular process joints of C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7, with mild osteophyte formation and sclerosis of the subchondral bone. Mild enlargement of the articular process joints of C2-C3 and C3-C4 was also noted. There was no evidence of spinal cord compression. Approximately 24 h after general anaesthesia, a persistent cough was noted, whilst the vital parameters were unremarkable. Thoracic ultrasound identi ed an increased number of comet tails and mild consolidation in bothcranioventral lung elds consistent with pneumonia. Upper airway endoscopy showed laryngitis with moderate tomarked in flammation and erosions extending caudally into the trachea for approximately ve cartilage rings. The lesions were symmetrical and localised at the 8 o 'clock to 10 o'clock and the 3 o 'clock to 5 o 'clock positions. The mare was diagnosed with laryngitis and moderative to severe erosive tracheitis with secondary pneumonia.Movement of the cuffed endotracheal tube was consideredas the most likely cause of the tracheal damage due to theextension, location and symmetry of the lesions. Treatment consisted of flunixin meglumine 1.1 mg/kg bwt intravenously every 24 h, doxycycline 10 mg/kg bwt orally every 12 h for 5 days and a single dose of dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg bwt intravenously. The following day, flunixin meglumine was discontinued and phenylbutazone 2.2 mg/kgbwt orally every 12 h was started. Three days later, upper airway endoscopy and thoracic ultrasonography showed a marked improvement of the laryngeal and tracheal in flammation with resolution of the previously identi ed consolidation in the cranioventral lung elds. Key points \u0081Tracheal and laryngeal trauma is common afterorotracheal intubation, and it may lead to pneumonia. \u0081Horses should be monitored closely for signs of trachealand laryngeal trauma after general anaesthesia for myelography. \u0081Tracheal damage by the movement of the cuffedendotracheal tube could be avoided by disconnecting the horse from the anaesthetic machine and by deflating the cuff for hoisting or neck flexion and extension.

Case Report Thrombosis of the median artery and its branches in a gelding: Clinical appearance, diagnosis and surgical management A. B. M. Rijkenhuizen,*, G. Nohl, F. Jaek-Lutzand V. email: a.rijkenhuizen@gmail.com Summary This case report describes the clinical appearance, the diagnosis and surgical management of a thrombosis of the median artery and its branches in a gelding. The medianartery is the distal continuation of the brachial artery, which provides the major blood supply in the forelimb. Thrombosis of this artery and its branches with consequent ischaemia in the distal extremity is rare and mostly accompanied by an acute onset of progressive severe lameness, sometimes accompanied by distress and colic symptoms. A 4-year-old Danish Warmblood presented with acute severe progressive right front leg lameness, not reacting on painkillers. Initial clinical examination, including radiographs, revealed no clear ndings, and a scintigraphic examination showed a decreased radiopharmaceutical uptake in theright front toe in comparison to the left limb. The following day, the temperature of the right front leg was signi cantly decreased, especially in the area distal to the carpus. Nopulsation of the digital arteries could be detected. Doppler ultrasonography revealed that the right median and distal radial artery were completely occluded over a distance of 30 cm by an echogenic, intraluminal mass ( Fig 1 ). Based on clinical ndings, a presumptive diagnosis of peripheral progressive occlusive thrombosis of the median artery and its distal branches was made. Initially, an anticoagulant treatment was initiated, however, without clinical improvement. The ischaemia became even worse, requiring surgical intervention. A similar approach as for the Aorta-iliac thrombosis in the hindlimb, using a Fogarty /C226thrombectomy catheter for removal of the thrombi, was undertaken in thefront limb, which has not been described previously. The median artery was localised as a hard round structure in the region of the midradius underneath the flexor carpi radialis muscle. The skin was incised dorsal to the muscle, and themedian artery was mobilised by careful blunt dissection. No pulse was felt. The artery was incised, and with the use of a thrombectomy catheter, thrombi were removed. The geldingrecovered initially, and the patient showed no lameness atwalk. Unfortunately, restenosis occurred, and the horsebecame severely lame 6 days after surgery. Due to a poor prognosis for a second surgery, the gelding was euthanised. Key points \u0081Occlusion of the median artery is a sporadic event with impressive clinical signs and might not be directly diagnosed due to it being a rare occurrence. \u0081The value of Doppler ultrasound for the diagnosis ofthe presence of the thrombosis is emphasised, which can also help to delineate the extent of the thrombosis. \u0081Surgical treatment of a patient with acute thrombosisof the median artery and its branches using a thrombectomy catheter might be worthwhile.

Kumar*, A. Shabir Khaki\u00a7and H. Mirza\u00a7 Department of Veterinary Pathology, Veterinary College, Bangalore, India;VetLesions Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Bangalore, India; and\u00a7Aspital reaction Summary Equine babesiosis in India has always been a severe and life- threatening disease, attributed to infection with Theileria equi and Babesia caballi . These organisms are not host-speci ca s both T.equi and B.caballi are also reported in dogs. Likewise, Babesia canis canis and Babesia canis rossi , the common causative agents in canines, were also identi ed in horses. However, no molecular evidence of Babesia gibsoni has been reported in horses in India. This case report describes a5-year-old Thoroughbred gelding residing in Bengaluru that showed signs of recurrent intermittent fever, inappetence, poor performance, anaemia and depression with abnormal haematological parameters and was suspected to have babesiosis. Generally, T.equi and B. caballi infect horses, but a study reported the identi cation of Babesia canis canis and Babesia canis rossi in horses, suggesting that piroplasms are not host-speci c. Therefore, B. canis canis ,B. gibsoni ,B. canis vogeli ,T. equi ,B. caballi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum were included in the study. Our study reported a rare case ofbabesiosis due to B. gibsoni . We did not detect B. canis canis , B. canis vogeli, T. equi , B. caballi and A. phagocytophilum . The unusual result was con rmed by DNA sequencing. A routine complete blood count (CBC)and biochemical pro le were performed and were non- responsive to therapeutic interventions. The total leukocytecount was high with thrombocytopenia. The blood smear examination revealed microcytic hypochromic RBCs. Thechemistry pro le showed elevated blood lactate level and decreased A/G ratio. The blood sample was submitted for screening for equine haemoprotozoans using polymerase chain reaction. The sample was positive for B. gibsoni and was con rmed by sequencing. BLAST search against GenBank revealed the highest similarity (95.17%, Accession No. MN385430.1) with B. gibsoni 18s rRNA partial sequence. However, this is the rst study that provides evidence concerning the occurrence of B. gibsoni among equines in Bengaluru, India ( Fig 1 ). Key points \u0081In India, equine babesiosis has long been a serious andsometimes fatal illness. The horse with aberrant haematological data, was suspected of having babesiosis. \u0081PCR and sequencing were used to screen B. canis canis ,B. gibsoni ,B. canis vogeli ,T. equi ,B. caballi and A. phagocytophilum . \u0081This is the rst research to offer evidence for the presence of B.gibsoni amid the horses in Bengaluru, ed products to test the haemoprotozoal DNA were run on 1.2% agarose gel depicting the sample positive for B. gibsoni -Positive control, Report Acute hindlimb paresis caused by extension of a peripheral nerve sheath tumour into the spinal canal of a horse N. M. Biermann,*, A. J. Doyle, P. Hannaand W. B. Stoughton Department of Health Management, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown, Canada; andDepartment of Pathology and Microbiology, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown, Quarter Horse gelding presented for a large, slowly growing mass of 8-month duration. A rm, nonpainful, immobile subcutaneous mass of approximately 29 9279 13 cm was present dorsally on the right side of the back between the 10th and 16th vertebrae ( Fig 1 ). Aside from a marked hyper brinogenaemia (9 g/L, normal range:1 -4 g/L), physical examination and laboratory parameters were within normal limits. Histological examination after a biopsy sample of the mass was taken led to the diagnosis of a low-grade soft tissue sarcoma. The mass was surgically removed under general anaesthesia, and the horse recovered uneventfully and returned to normal riding activity half a year later with no signs of external regrowth. Two years after surgery, the horse developed within a 2-week period progressive signs of hindlimb weakness, ataxia and adopting a dog-sitting stance. A neurological examination revealed an asymmetrical weakness and ataxia of the hindlimbs with the right being a grade 3/5 and the left 2/5, as well as hypalgesia and cutaneous trunci reflex de cits caudal to the 12th rib on the right side. Due to the apparent progressive nature of the neurological de cits and consequent poor prognosis, humane euthanasia was recommended. The post-mortem examination revealed that an approximately 3.5 92-cm mass was protruding from the right side into the spinal canal at the level of T12, causingcompression of the cord ( Fig 2 ). A smaller slightly protruding mass of similar gross morphology extended into the spinalcanal at the level of T11 ( Fig 2 ). A direct connection between the tumours and the previous surgical site was not identi ed; however, the mass extended from the tissues surrounding thevertebrae through the intervertebral foramen into the spinal canal. No involvement of peripheral nerves or gross metastasis were present. Polymerase chain reaction for detection of bovine papillomavirus type 1 and type 2 was negative and immunohistochemistry revealed a staining pattern consistent with a diagnosis of a peripheral nerve sheath tumour. Given the similar histological appearance of tissues between the original mass and that causing the later neurological signs, regrowth of the initial tumour can be considered most likely in this case. Key points /C15Incomplete tumour resection, local recurrence and extension of a peripheral nerve sheath tumour into the central nervous system can occur even years after initial tumour removal. /C15In cases where the tumour location is closelyassociated with neural structures, further tumour differentiation via immunohistochemistry may prove bene cial to anticipate potential long term complications like spinal cord compression andassociated neurological de cits. /C15Early removal of a tumour located close to the spinalcord, as well the use of adjunctive therapies, should be considered to minimise the chances of regrowth and its potential complications.

T10 -T15: Indicates the bodies of Diffuse osteomyelitis of the fourth metacarpal bone in a horse caused by Clostridium perfringens C. E. Smith,*, M. D. Cullen, I. M. Forman, A. M. Talbotand J. D. Stack School of Veterinary Science, Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital, for further investigation of left forelimb swelling and lameness after sustaining a small wound 18days previously. The referring veterinarian had surgically explored the region anticipating an abscess or a sequestrum, neither of which were identied. On presentation, there was a painful, diffuse swellingof the left distal forelimb. No lameness was observed at walk. A 3-cm vertical skin wound was present on the lateral aspect of the left fore proximal metacarpus (Mc) at the site of surgical exploration.Visible and palpable effusion of the middle carpal joint was noted. Centesis of the middle carpal joint yielded normal synovial fluid. A deep swab taken from the wound was negative for bacterial culture. Ultrasound and radiography demonstratedmultifocal palisading periosteal new bone formation along McIVwith the exception of a short segment of McIV at the level of the original wound, and diffuse soft tissue swelling. Computed tomography (CT) under general anaesthesia identi ed a Y- shaped cortical fracture of the lateral cortex of McIII and diffuse osteomyelitis of McIV Grade 4a (Cierny). Following CT, the and pockets were debrided and lavaged. Debridement of infected cortical bone and reaming of the infected medulla, although indicated, were not undertaken due to the risk of destabilising the proximal McIV and breaching the carpometacarpal joint and potentialsynovial contamination. A sample of new periosteal bone fromMcIV was submitted for bacterial culture and direct Gram smear, both of which were negative for evidence of bacteria. The wound was partially closed and intravenous regional limbperfusion (IVRP) was carried out with amikacin (500 mg). Due to the fracture in McIII identi ed by CT, a full limb cast was placed for general anaesthetic recovery. The mare was administered phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kg bwt q. 12 h) and oxytetracycline(7.5 mg i.v. q. 12 h) and was maintained in a Robert Jonesbandage. IVRP (amikacin 500 mg) was repeated on alternatedays. After 4 days, the mare was discharged on oral doxycycline (10 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h) and phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h). There was no lameness evident at walk, andthe wound was well-apposed with minimal discharge at this time. Four days following hospital discharge, the mare represented due to the marked increase in lameness, pain and swelling atthe surgical site. Purulent material discharged from the woundupon palpation. A sample was taken for bacterial culture, whichyielded a heavy growth of Clostridium perfringens . Radiographs showed changes compatible with diffuse osteomyelitis affectingmost of McIV and the McIII fracture. All sutures were removed to facilitate drainage, and the wound was lavaged. Once culture results identi edClostridium perfringens , the horse was administered enro floxacin (7.5 mg/kg per os q. 24 h) and metronidazole (15 mg/kg per os q. 8 h).Metronidazole-soaked gauze swabs were placed within the wound pocket and IVRP was carried out daily with ceftiofur (500 mg). The mare was discharged after a further 8 days onenro floxacin, metronidazole and tapering courses of phenylbutazone and paracetamol. Ten months following diagnosis some mild swelling of the proximolateral aspect of the metacarpus remained, however,there was no pain on palpation and the horse was sound atwalk and trot. Sequential radiographs over this time demonstrated complete focal bone resorption of McIV in the region of McIV that did not demonstrate periosteal new boneformation. This area was subsequently ossi ed, and McIV underwent substantial remodelling ( Fig 1 ). Key points \u0081Computed tomography radiography of osteomyelitis and Y-shaped fracture of McIII following a small wound. \u0081Aggressive medical and surgical debridement of infectedbone is recommended for the treatment of diffuseosteomyelitis of long bones. Aggressive surgicaldebridement of infected bone was not possible in this case resulting in the requirement for protracted and aggressive medical treatment. \u0081Diffuse osteomyelitis, in this case, resulted in extensivebone remodelling that was still ongoing 10 months following original injury. \u0081Clostridium perfringens is an uncommon bacteria isolate in osteomyelitis in horses.

Fischer Jr Chino Valley Equine Hospital, Chino Hills, California, 9-year-old Quarter Horse mare was referred with a 3-month history of continuous oestrus, polyuria and suspected pyometra. According to the owner, he had placed a glass marble in the mare 's uterus 90 days earlier, and within the next 2 days, the horse began to urinate frequently. Onpresentation, the patient was bright and alert and showed no signs of pain or discomfort. Upon further examination, off- white sediment was observed on the lower hindlimbs and tail. Transrectal palpation and ultrasonographic examination of the reproductive tract revealed a large amount of sediment within the urine and the presence of a spherical structure consistent with a glass marble; however, it was not possible to distinguish the location of the suspected marble, and due to con rmation bias, the assumption was that it was in the uterus. A hysteroscopy was performed; the endometrium hada pale pink colour, and there was no gross visual evidence of a glass marble nor fluid either in the uterine horn or in the uterine body. After emptying the urinary bladder, anendoscopic examination demonstrated the presence of a spherical calculus with a spiculated surface ( Fig 1 ). The urethra was distended manually, and a specimen retrieval bag was used under endoscopic guidance for calculus removal. The calculus was identi ed as a spiculated type I urolith of 47 mm by 45 mm, and after the exteriorlayers were removed, the presence of a glass marble in its nucleus was noted ( Fig 2 ). Urinary bladder endoscopic re-examination 24 hours after the calculus removal showed a subtle decrease in themucosal irritation. Telephone follow-up with the owner 1 monthafter the discharge reported that the mare had not shownany sign of discomfort while urinating nor sign of continuous oestrus. Key points \u0081Endoscopic examination is a helpful imaging technique in the evaluation of the reproductive and lower urinary tract and the diagnosis of cystic urolithiasis. \u0081Case examinations must be approached with an openmind, considering the possibility of less common or less likely differential diagnoses if test results are inconclusive. \u0081If there is a true correlation between a mare \u00b4s oestrus cycle and behaviour or performance problems, the clinician must counsel the owner of the potential disadvantages or complications of each suppression method, allowing for informed decision-making.

Kock Nicolaisen, A. Bendix Nygaard, M. T. Christophersen, D. B. Jensenand C. Lindegaard* Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Taastrup; andDepartment of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Taastrup, head and tail rope; mortality Summary The recovery phase is a critical period during equine anaesthesia. In an attempt to reduce the risk of recovery, several recovery systems, including head and tail ropes, have been developed over time. However, the clinical safety and ef cacy of these systems have not been compared to a nonassisted group in a larger study. The objective of thiscomparative, retrospective, nonrandomised single-centre study was to determine whether the risk of developing fatal and nonfatal complications after general anaesthesia is reduced in horses assisted with head and tail ropes during recovery compared with horses recovering unassisted. Included were all horses undergoing general anaesthesia at the Large Animal Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, from 2010 to 2019. Analysed data included age, body mass, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade of physical status (ASA score), type of surgery and anaesthetic duration. Complications were divided into none ,fatal and nonfatal . Logistic regression was performed to analyse the risk and predictors of fatal and nonfatal complications using the built-in R function 'step '. Tukey 's honest signi cance difference test was applied to determine signi cance, set at P<0.05, within the categorical variables of the reduced models. The study included 1252 horses: 662 recovered with assistance (group A) and 590 without (group NA). Overall recovery-associated mortality was 1.4%: 0.6% in group A and 2.2% in group NA. Both emergency abdominal surgery (P=0.004) and duration of surgery (P =0.0001) affected the risk of fatal complications negatively. Assisted recovery(P=0.02) signi cantly reduced the risk of fatal complications after emergency abdominal surgery. The limitation of thestudy was a lack of randomisation and potentially a larger proportion of sedation among assisted horses. It was concluded that emergency abdominal surgery and duration of anaesthesia are signi cant risk factors for fatal complications during recovery. Head and tail rope-assistedrecovery is a signi cant factor of reducing fatal complications during recovery after emergency abdominal surgery. Introduction General anaesthesia of horses is associated with a relatively highmortality rate, and generally, mortality rates around 0.9% have been reported in healthy horses undergoing elective procedures (Young and Taylor 1993; Johnston et al . 1995; Johnston et al . 2002; Dugdale et al .2 0 1 6 a ;L a u r e n z a et al . 2020). Much highermortality rates have been reported in horses undergoingemergency procedures, especially emergency abdominal surgeries with mortality rates as high as 10.4% (Johnston et al . 2002). However, the reported equine perioperative mortality ratevaries greatly, depending on the study design and the number of post-operative days included (Johnston et al . 2002; Bidwell et al. 2007; Niimura Del Barrio et al. 2018). A signi cant reason for the high reported mortality in horses might be the horse 's size (body mass and conformation) combined with its inherent flight behaviour and incoordination in the immediate post-anaesthetic period.These factors may lead to premature attempts to stand, and if unsuccessful, over time this may increase the risk of injuries (Hubbell 2004). A recent study reported the mortality associated with the recovery phase alone, to be 1.1% (Dugdale et al . 2016a). The majority (71.4%) of these deaths were related to severeorthopaedic trauma. Other studies have also reported a high proportion of anaesthesia-related fatalities to be caused by orthopaedic trauma (Bidwell et al . 2007, 38%). Furthermore, most studies have reported at least half of the anaesthesia- related mortality to be associated with the recovery phase (Young and Taylor 1993; Johnston et al . 2002; Dugdale et al . 2016a). Over time, various recovery systems have been described and developed in order to reduce the prevalence andseverity of complications during recovery. Techniques include, but are not limited to, manual assistance of the horse, tilt table recovery (Elmas et al . 2007), hydropool recovery (Tidwell et al . 2002), pool-raft (Sullivan et al . 2002), sling recovery (Taylor et al . 2005) and head and tail rope assistance (Wilderjans 2008). The head and tail rope recoverysystem has been advocated as a simple system that is easy and safe to use for both horses and experienced staff (Wilderjans 2008). Few studies have compared perioperative mortality rate with and without the use of head and tail rope, and it is still debated whether this system improves the recovery quality and reduces the mortality rate (Auer and Huber 2012; R \u00a8uegg et al . 2016; Arndt et al . 2020). At the Large Animal Hospital (LAH), University of Copenhagen, Denmark, all recoveries until 2014 were generally nonassisted with very few manually assisted cases (mainly foals). Since 2014, the head and tail rope technique has been applied for all anaesthetised horses except in cases where contraindications did not allow its application. \u00a92020 10.1111/eve.13397The aim of this study was to report the overall safety of head and tail rope-assisted recovery and to determine whether the risk of fatal and nonfatal complications after general anaesthesia is reduced in horses assisted during recovery compared with horses that were not assisted. In addition, other risk factors for recovery-associated complications were included and analysed. Materials and methods This study was conducted as a retrospective nonrandomisedcomparative study approved by the Local Ethical Committee of the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Universityof Copenhagen (approval #2019-008). Inclusion criteria Anaesthetic records of all horses undergoing generalanaesthesia from January 2010 until January 2019 (n =1491) at the LAH were included in the study, regardless of thesurgical procedure. Horses that were euthanised or died during surgery were excluded. Furthermore, horses <1 year of age were excluded, since this age group is generally notsubjected to head and tail rope recovery. Study population Data collected from the medical records included breed,age, gender (mare, stallion or gelding), data from preanaesthetic examination, anaesthetic protocol,anaesthetic and surgical duration, surgical procedure, length of the recovery period and the clinical status 24 h post- operatively. Horses experiencing complications during recovery were identi ed and classi ed into three categories based on their perianaesthetic outcome: no complications ,nonfatal complications and fatal complications (death ,including euthanasia ). For statistical comparison, fatal complications where horses were recumbent for an extended period of time, without being able to stand, or stay standing, and without any obvious neurologic de cits were grouped as 'myopathy-like fatalities '. Nonfatal complications included cornea ulceration, skin abrasions, facial paralysis and nonfatal myopathies. For each horse, two of the authors (A.S.K.N. and A.B.N.) retrospectively assigned an ASA score, based on the preanaesthetic examination including complete blood count (CBC), blood lactate, peritoneal fluid analysis in horses subjected to emergency abdominal surgeryand other relevant information retrievable from the record (Auer and Stick 2012). Anaesthesia monitoring Heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure weremonitored in all horses. Invasive blood pressure was monitored in the majority horses, although omitted in somehorses due to short procedure and /or failure to establish access to an artery. Arterial blood gas analysis (RadiometerABL 800 FLEX Q \u00ae)1was performed once during each anaesthetic period unless indicated otherwise.Electrocardiogram, end-tidal CO 2and iso flurane, as well as pulse in horses with a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) below 60 -70 mmHg depending on the preference of the attending anaesthetist.Premedication included acepromazine (Plegicil\u00ae)4 0.03 /kg included atropine (Atropin [magistrel])100.005 mg /kg midazolam iso flurane vaporised in 85 -90% oxygen on assisted ventilation (Smith Ventilator L.A. 95\u00ae15or Smith Ventilator LA- 2100 +\u00ae16) in a custom-made closed circle system. If required, was administered at the attending surgeons ' discretion. Recovery procedure Horses anaesthetised from January 2010 to September 2014 were recovered unassisted (group NA), while horses anaesthetised from October 2014 to January 2019 were recovered using a head and tail rope-assisted system (group A). Sedation prior to recovery was not administered routinely, but approximately one-third of the horses (mainly group A) received a low dose of an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist and/or an opioid administered i.v. immediately prior to recovery. The bladder of all horses was catheterised duringanaesthesia to enable emptying prior to recovery. At the end of surgery, all horses were transferred to a 3.9 \u00d73.6-m, fully padded, recovery stall and positioned in lateral recumbencyusing a hoist. Nasopharyngeal tubes were placed bilaterally and infused with 85 -90% oxygen at 10 -15 L/min until the connection was lost due to head movement. For horses in group A, a self-tightening knot was tied around the tail using an inelastic rope and connected to thelong tail rope via a carabiner. All horses wore a designated halter with the head rope attached directly to the noseband via a carabiner. Two diagonally oppositely placed metal rings installed at 2.35 m above the floor were used to direct the head and tail ropes outside the recovery stall where thesewere managed by one or two individuals who adjusted tightening until the horse was standing. The ropes werereleased after the horse had been standing safely for 5-15 min (tail rope rst). A remote-release mechanism is incorporated into the ropes 'attachments to the head collar and tail knot to avoid the operators from going inside the recovery stall ( Supplementary item 1 ). The recovery area was kept as quiet as possible with the lighting dimmed in order toavoid unnecessary disturbance and excitement of the horses during recovery. The recovery of horses in group A was scored using a descriptive scoring system with a score from 0 to 5, with '0'representing very poor and violent recovery or \u00a92020 EVJ Ltd127 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2022horse not standing after 2 h and '5'representing perfect recovery in rst attempt (Young and Taylor 1993). Recovery was only scored systematically for group A, since it was introduced along with the assisted recovery procedure. The two groups, A and NA, were compared in terms of their distributions of physical characteristic (body mass, age and gender). In addition, the two groups were compared in terms of the distributions of causes for the recorded complications. The categorical variables, that is gender and cause of complications, were compared by Fisher 's exact test using the built-in R function sher.test . The numerical variables, that is body mass and age, could not be assumed to be normally distributed and were therefore compared using a bootstrapping approach, employing the central limit theorem; for each of the two groups, the values of the numerical variables were resampled randomly with replacement 1000 times, and the mean values of each random resampling were calculated and stored. The 1000 sample means from the two groups were then compared by a nonpaired two-sided t-test using the built-in R function t.test . In all cases, the threshold for signi cance was set at P <0.05. Statistical modelling Logistic regression was performed to analyse the effect ofvarious predictors on the risk of fatal and nonfatal complications during the recovery period. The following variables were included as potential predictors: assistance (yes or no); surgical procedure (elective, emergency abdominal or emergency nonabdominal); anaesthetic duration (min); body mass (kg); and ASA score (1, 2, 3 +). The ASA score ranges from 1 to 5, but in our available data only42 (3.3%) of the observed horses had ASA score of 4, and only one horse (0.08%) had an ASA score of 5. For this reason, ASA scores 3, 4 and 5 were combined into grade 3 +. The logit models for this study were made in R (R Core Team 2017) using the built-in glm function with the binomial family. Three separate logit functions were created fordescribing (1) the overall risk of death; (2) the risk of death after emergency abdominal surgery; and (3) the risk of nonfatal complications. For all three models, all ve potential predictors were included as initial independent variables(except surgical procedure in model (2)). These initial models were then reduced using the built-in R function step with the direction variable set to 'both '. This function reduces the model to only include variables which contribute a positive predictive value to the model, measured in terms of the Akaike information criterion (AIC). For reduced models which included categorical variables with more than two categories, Tukey' s honest signi cance difference (HSD) test was applied to determine which speci c categories yielded signi cantly different effects, compared with other speci c categories. This was performed using the glht function from the multcomp package (Bretz et al . 2017). For interpretation and illustrative purposes, the logit values predicted by the reduced models for a range of possiblescenarios were converted to probability of event (death and / or complications, depending on the model), usingequation 1: probability \u00bc ex 1\u00feex(1) where xis the estimated logit value.Furthermore, the proportions of fatal complications caused by limb fractures and myopathy, respectively, were compared for assisted versus nonassisted horses. This was performed using Fisher 's exact test by calling the R function sher.test . The same test was used to compare the overall incidence rates of the two types of complications in the two groups of horses. Signi cance was set at P< 0.05. Results During the 8-year study period, 1491 horses underwentgeneral anaesthesia ( Supplementary item 2 ). Ninety-three horses were euthanised during surgery due to inoperable disease, four horses died due to cardiac arrest and 108 horses were excluded from the study because of their young age. This resulted in a total of 1286 that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 34 horses were excluded from further analysis because of missing data. A total of 1252 horses were included in the statistical analyses, which consisted of 662 horses in group A and 590 horses in group NA. The two groups did not differ signi cantly with regard to body mass (P=0.93), age (P =0.95) and gender (Fisher 's test P- value =0.08). Complications related to the head and tail rope system, including halter failure where it either fell off or broke and failure of the ropes, that is loosening of the knot when pulling, were reported in 39 /677 horses (5.76%). None of these failures resulted in further complications. Overall, 52 horses (4.1%) experienced recovery-associated complications, leading to death or euthanasia in 17 of these(1.4% of all horses). In group A, the mortality rate was 0.6% (4 / 662), and in group NA, 2.2% (13 /590) ( Table 1 ). Causes of fatal complications Of the 13 horses in group NA that developed fatal complications during the recovery period, three horses sustained a fracture, one horse developed non- weightbearing lameness of undiagnosed aetiology that couldnot be managed, one horse developed severe respiratory distress and eight horses developed severe myopathy-like signs. Of the eight horses with myopathy-like signs, ve were con rmed as myopathy and three did not receive a nal diagnosis. Of the four horses in group A that developed fatal complications during the recovery period, one horse developed vascular collapse, two horses sustained a fracture and one horse died from acute airway obstruction. The incidence of recovery-associated fractures did not differ signi cantly between the two groups (NA: 3 /590 vs. A: 2 / 662, P =0.67). The incidence of myopathy-associated death was signi cantly lower in group A (0 /662) than in group NA (8 /590) (P=0.0024). When group A horses were divided into procedural categories, the mortality rate was 0.0% (0 /409) for elective procedure cases, 1.3% (2 /149) for emergency abdominal surgery cases and 1.9% (2 /104) for emergency nonabdominal surgery cases. When group NA horses were divided into procedural categories, the mortality rate was 0.6% (2 /348) for elective procedure cases, 7.9% (11 /140) for emergency abdominal surgery cases and 0.0% (0 /102) for emergency nonabdominal surgery cases. \u00a92020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2022Overall risk of death When compared to elective and nonemergency abdominal procedures, emergency abdominal surgery was related to a signi cantly higher risk of death during recovery (P =0.004) (Table 2 ). Using the Tukey HSD test, the types of surgical procedures and their relation to the risk of fatalcomplications during recovery were analysed. The estimates of the differences show that the risk is signi cantly higher during emergency abdominal procedure compared withelective procedure (P =0.01). The risk does not differ signi cantly when comparing emergency nonabdominal procedure and elective procedure (P =1.00) or emergency nonabdominal procedure and emergency abdominalprocedure (P =0.16). Increased anaesthetic duration signi cantly increased the risk of fatal complications (P =0.0001). The median anaesthetic duration was 105 min for horses with nocomplications, 170 min for horses which died /were euthanised during recovery and 130 min for horses with other nonfatalcomplications during recovery ( Fig 1 ). Risk of death after emergency abdominal surgery After emergency abdominal surgery, group A had asigni cantly lower risk of fatal complications than group NA (P=0.02). Body mass did not in fluence the risk of death signi cantly (P =0.11). This factor was, however, found to be predictive in terms of the AIC value during the step-wise reduction in the model ( Table 3 and Fig 2 ).Risk of nonfatal complications The reduced logistic regression model describing the risk of nonfatal complications during recovery after surgery con rms that the risk is increased for horses undergoing emergencyabdominal surgery (P =0.04). Furthermore, the risk of nonfatal complications is increased with longer anaesthetic duration in emergency abdominal surgery ( Fig 3 ). Discussion This study reports an overall mortality rate of 1.4% during recovery after general anaesthesia. In group A, the overall mortality rate was 0.6%, and in group NA, 2.2%. A recent study (Niimura Del Barrio et al . 2018) using head and tail rope during recovery exclusively reported an overall mortality rateof 0.2% including both elective and emergency surgeries (including emergency abdominal surgery). Another study (Bidwell et al . 2007) reported an overall mortality rate of 0.12% also including both elective and emergency surgeries(including emergency abdominal surgery) and with all horses, except weanling and yearlings, recovered using head and tail rope assistance. These mortality rates are lower than the ones reported in our population of horses. Direct comparison between studies is, however, dif cult due to potential differences in study design, populations and surgicalprocedures. In the study by Bidwell et al . (2007), only 6% of the 17,961 horses underwent emergency abdominal surgery.In the study by Niimura Del Barrio et al . (2018), the distribution of surgeries is not described, and although almost half of thecomplications were encountered in emergency abdominal surgery cases, the reported mean anaesthetic duration of 98 min might suggest that a large percentage of the surgeries were most likely elective. For both studies, the proportion of emergency abdominal surgeries is in stark contrast to the distribution in the present study where 23.0% underwent emergency abdominal surgery, 16.5% underwent other nonabdominal emergency surgical procedures and only 60.5% of the horses underwent an elective surgical procedure. The mortality rate after elective surgery in the present study was 0.0% in group A and 0.6% in group NA. Hence, the high proportion of both abdominal and nonabdominal emergency surgeries in the present studycompared with the studies by Bidwell et al . (2007) and Niimura Del Barrio et al . (2018) can possibly explain the lower mortality rate in comparison with our study. In the present study, the mortality rate after elective surgeries in both groups A and NA is lower compared withTABLE 1: Descriptive statistics of the categorical variables, as they relate to the number of horses who had no complications, had fatal complication or had nonfatal complications during recovery after surgery Categorical variable Category No complications Death Other complications Assistance Yes 641 4 17 No 559 13 18 Surgical procedure Elective procedure 743 3 12 Emergency abdominal surgery 260 13 15 Emergency nonabdominal surgery 197 1 8 ASA score 1 793 3 14 2 205 4 9 3+ 202 10 12 TABLE 2: Parameter estimates for the reduced logistic regression model describing the overall risk of a fatal complication of ahorse during recovery after surgery Variable Estimate (logit) s.e.

Although not analysed, this difference may at least in part beattributed to improved routines in anaesthetic management and monitoring.Another factor further complicating direct comparison of mortality rates between studies is the de nition of the perioperative period. In different studies, this period variesbetween only including the recovery phase to including up to 7 days post-operatively or even until the horse was discharged from the hospital. In the present study, the main objective was to analyse the effect of head and tail rope assistance with a secondary objective of identifying other explanatory variables directly affecting the risk of complications in the recovery; hence, we decided to only look at the rst 24 h post-operatively. One of the most frequently reported causes of fatal complications during recovery is unrepairable limb fractures and joint luxations (Hubbell 2004; R \u00a8uegg al 2016a; Niimura Del Barrio et al . 2018).

This is in accordance with some other studies that emphasise that the use of head and tail rope assistance does not prevent fractures (Tevik 1983; Auer and Huber 2012; Niimura Del Barrio et al. 2018; Arndt et al. 2020). However, others have reported very low proportions of severe orthopaedic trauma in studiesincluding only head and tail rope-assisted horses (Wilderjans 2005; Niimura et al . 2014). Whether head and tail rope assistance does reduce severe orthopaedic trauma duringrecovery is therefore still not certain. Body mass could not be shown to signi cantly in fluence the risk of developing a fatal complication during recovery. However, it was still an informative predictive parameter when modelling the risk after emergency abdominal surgery which is in accordance with other studies (Dugdale et al . 2016a). The modelling, however, further showed that assistedrecovery almost eliminated the effect of body mass. To the authors 'knowledge, this effect has not been documented before, although it makes biological /biomechanical sense that assistance might help heavier horses more than lighter horses. For both the entire population and the subset of horses undergoing emergency abdominal surgery, no association was found between increased ASA score and the risk of fatal complications. This is in contrast to previous studies which have shown a signi cant increase in mortality with increasing ASA score (Johnston et al . 2004; Dugdale and Taylor 2016b). There might be several reasons for this difference; travel tothe hospital is relatively short leading to fewer horses with high ASA score or that horses with high ASA scores have an anticipated poor prognosis why they are not operated or are euthanised on the table, hence not included in the study. Alternatively, the difference might simply re flect large interobserver variations reported in ASA grading (McMillanand Brearley 2013). Although the proportion of myopathy-associated deaths did not differ between groups, the overall incidence was signi cantly lower in group A (0 horses) than in group NA (8 horses). In the current study, 'myopathy-associated deaths ' were horses with normal mentation and with no signs of deciencies of either the peripheral or the central nervous system, thereby making these horses unable to stand, eitherbecause of true postanaesthetic myopathy (PAM) or because of exhaustion myositis. Severe myopathy was mainly seen among horses after abdominal emergency surgery and often associated with exhaustion combined with poor circulation and long duration of surgery. Head and tail rope assistance seem to help otherwise ataxic and /or potentially exhausted horses to stand earlier and with fewerattempts than without assistance (Arndt et al . 2020). Although the number of attempts to stand and the overallrecovery score were not analysed, it is the authors ' impression that this was also true for the horses in thepresent study. In this way, assistance prevents horses from exhausting themselves during repetitive attempts to stand and thereby reduces the number of horses eventually euthanised because of the inability to stand whether this be due to exhaustion myopathy or weakness. Post-anaesthetic myopathy may be prevented by suf cient tissue perfusion and arterial oxygenation during the anaesthetic et al . 1987; Young and Taylor 1993; Duke et al . 2006). In the current study, arterial blood pressure wasmonitored continuously and horses with MAP below60-70 mmHg were treated with dobutamine, crystalloids and or colloids based on the preferences of the attendingsurgeon. The practice of this did not change during the study period. To the authors 'knowledge, it has not previously been reported whether assistance will in fluence the incidence of horses not able to stand or the development of post-operative myopathy. Generally, the choice of predictors to analyse is always a matter of debate. Having too many parameters compared with the number of observed events increases the risk of over tting, which would mean the model would not generalise to data which are not included in the study. Forthis reason, variables, which have previously been shown to be relevant and /or which makes most sense in our opinion (body mass, surgical procedure, duration of anaesthesia,disease status of the horse [ASA score]), were included in the data analysis (Young and Taylor 1993; Johnston et al. 2002; Dugdale and Taylor 2016b). However, there is always a risk ofmissing a relevant predictive parameter and this risk might only be overcome in much larger data sets or in a meta- analysis of several studies. With regard to the nonfatal complications, only the anaesthetic duration and the type of surgical procedure contained predictive information; longer anaesthetic durations correspond to higher risks of complications, and this effect is consistently higher for all emergency procedures compared with elective surgery. Several previous studieshave documented an increased risk of mortality with increasing duration of surgery and with speci c types of procedures (Tevik 1983; Young and Taylor 1990; Johnstonet al . 2002). This may correlate well with the increased risk of nonfatal complications documented in the present study.However, the lack of effect of head and tail rope assistance on the risk of nonfatal complications observed in the present study is in contrast to the study by Arndt et al . (2020), which found a signi cant reduction in these complications in the assisted horses. In the present study, complications related to the assistance system were reported in 5.76% (39 /677) of the horses, which compares well to previous studies which havereported failure of the system to be between 0.08% (Niimura Del Barrio et al . 2018) and 15% (R \u00a8uegg et al . 2016). However, in the present study, failure of the assistance system did notlead to any further complications which are in contrast to the study by R \u00a8uegg et al . (2016), where the high proportion of failures was considered to be responsible for theunexpectedly high number of dangerous and fatal complications encountered. Limitations of the study The main limitation of the present study is the lack of randomisation and the fact that almost all NA horses are from one period and A horses from another. In addition, although not always documented, the use of sedation during recovery was increased over time; that is, more group A horses than group NA horses may have received supplemental sedation during recovery which might introduce a bias to the results, since sedation during recovery has been shown to result in improved quality of the recovery which might theoretically also reduce the number of complications (Woodhouse et al . 2013). \u00a92020 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2022Furthermore, and due to the retrospective nature of the study, the number of attempts at standing and the duration of recovery were not recorded for all horses and were therefore not included in the analysis. Conclusion The application of head and tail rope signi cantly reduces the risk of fatal complications during recovery after emergency abdominal surgery. Speci cally, the incidence of horses not gaining a standing position after surgery(myopathy related complications) is signi cantly lower in assisted versus nonassisted recoveries, overall making an argument for the use of assisted recovery, particularly after emergency abdominal surgery. Furthermore, increased body mass of the horse was found to be of positive predictive value in relation to the risk of fatal complications, but this risk appears to be negated when the horse is assisted. Assisted recovery was not found to add any positive predictive value in relation to the risk of nonfatal complications. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

The ASA-PS has been applied to animals includinghorses, but its use is problematic. The authors virtually convened a group of internationally recognised equine veterinary anaesthesiologists with the goal of developing a risk assessment tool for the evaluation of healthy and diseased horses presented for anaesthesia. With this survey and analysis, the authors aim to develop a simple rubric system to assess equine anaesthetic risk that augments the ASA-PS system. The goal is to identify both diseased and healthy horses at increased anaesthetic risk prior to induction of anaesthesia so that measures might be implemented to potentially reduce morbidity and mortality. Introduction Anaesthesia of the horse is more perilous than anaesthesia forany other common domestic species. Most of the reports on anaesthesia in horses report mortality rates of approximately 1%, whereas reports on humans, dogs and cats indicate rates of 0.02, 0.05 and 0.11%, respectively (Brodbelt et al., 2008; Hackett et al., 2015; Senior, 2015). Horses respond to anaesthesia in a qualitatively similar manner to other species but their temperament, size, weight and anatomy increase the likelihood and magnitude of a number of anaesthetic- associated pathophysiologic, neuromuscular and orthopaedic issues that are atypical for other domestic animals (Hubbell & Muir, 2015; Klineberg & Bagshaw, 1981). Horses exhibit a high level of sensitivity, stress and intense reactions to environmental stimuli (Houpt, 2006; Lansade et al., 2007; Lloyd et al., 2008; Mills et al., 2002). Once anaesthetised and recumbent horses experience greater increases in alveolar dead space, right-to-left intrapulmonary shunting, ventilation-perfusion mismatching and greater decreases in venous return and cardiac output than reported for other commonly anaesthetised species (Dobson et al., 1985; Hopster et al., 2015; Steffey & Howland, 1980). Pulmonary function is further affected by gravity, upper airway resistance, impairment of chest wall expansion, transdiaphragmatic pressure differences and the type and extent of ventilatory assistance applied (Day et al., 1995; Moens et al., 1995; Nyman et al., 1990; Youngblood et al.,2020). These changes and others begin immediately afterinduction to anaesthesia and recumbency, are progressiveand often persist into the recovery period (Mason et al., 1987). Evidence-based studies examining equine anaesthetic risk (EQAR) are limited and largely dependent on data collected and assembled by the Con dential Enquiry into Perioperative Equine Fatalities (CEPEF 1 and 2) that was conductedbetween 1991 and 1997. The results were reported in a series of publications extending from 1995 to 2004 (Johnston, 2005; Johnston et al., 1995, 2002, 2004). Data were collected on horses, whilst anaesthetised and for 7 days after anaesthesia and established a mortality rate of 0.9% in 'non-colic 'horses anaesthetised for a variety of procedures. Factors associatedwith an increased risk included age (horses >14 years), the treatment of fractures, out-of-hours anaesthesia and surgery,the use of romi dine, and inhalant anaesthesia without pre- medication. Anaesthetic risk was reduced whenacepromazine alone was used as a pre-anaesthetic drug ortotal intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) was administered. Cardiac arrest or collapse accounted for 33% of deaths and fractures and myopathy during recovery accounted for 32%. Others have investigated the factors that in fluence EQAR and reported mortality rates ranging from 0.08 to 1.8%(Bidwell et al., 2007; Dugdale et al., 2016; Laurenza et al., 2020; Mee et al., 1998a, 1998b; Senior et al., 2007). Factors purported to be associated with lower fatality rates include early case referral, standardised anaesthetic protocols, shorter procedure times and appropriately trained veterinarians or veterinary technical assistants performing anaesthesia (Bidwell et al., 2007). A single-centre retrospective analysis of perioperative mortality from 2016 reported a mortality rate of 0.9% for non- colic cases similar to the CEPEF study conducted some 20 years previously (Dugdale et al., 2016). A striking distinction from the CEPEF study was that all fatalities occurred during recovery or in the post-operative period. The reasons for the shift from intraoperative deaths to fatalities during recovery are not clear but might include changes in the drugs used for induction of anaesthesia and the inhalants used (sevo flurane or iso flurane instead of halothane), and improved monitoring of cardiopulmonary function and anaesthetic depth. Identi ed risk factors included increased body mass, anaesthetic duration, time of day when the anaesthesiaoccurred, increasing age, and diminished health status as assessed using the scale developed for humans by the American Society of Anesthesia (ASA). In their summary, the \u00a92021 flighty nature of the horse, which is often suggested to have the greatest in fluence on recovery quality, will limit future improvements '. Past and more recent reports on EQAR could be used to infer that equine anaesthetic care has not improved in the last 25 years and that future improvements should not be anticipated (Bidwell et al., 2007; Dugdale et al., 2016; Johnston, 2005; Johnston et al., 1995, 2002, 2004; Laurenza et al., 2020; Mee et al., 1998a, 1998b; Senior et al., 2007). Alternatively, the increasing complexity of equine surgical and imaging procedures combined with longer periods of anaesthesia necessitate the need for improved equine peri-anaesthetic care. A large portion of that improvement requires advancing the knowledge of individuals who perform equine anaesthesia through research and education, utilisation of improved monitoring and ventilation techniques and the development of facilities and procedures that are focussed on improving outcomes (Hubbell, 2020). The development of methods for identifying factors associated with EQAR as part of the pre- anaesthetic evaluation could improve outcomes by facilitating discussions leading to the altering of protocols or procedures to reduce risk where possible. The most widely used method of assessing the physical status of humans presented for anaesthesia is the ASA Physical Status Classi cation System (ASA-PS). The original ASA-PS was developed in 1941 to record patientpreoperative health and described 6 classes of physical status providing examples of diseases in each class (Saklad,1941). Although the system was not developed to assign anaesthetic risk per se, it is currently considered the standard method for doing so and for determining the fees associated with the anaesthetic procedure. The ASA-PS system has undergone a number of revisions since its origination. Most notably, examples of disease states for each category were included in the original version, then eliminated, and then were added, a step that appears to improve reliability (Hurwitz et al., 2017). Numerous publications in human medicine, however, have questioned the reliability of the ASA-PS system as a risk assessment tool. Most have discovered relatively wide variability in the assignment of status with no consistent pattern (Dripps et al., 1961; Mayhew et al., 2019; Owens et al., 1978; Sankar et al., 2014). A recent informative systematic review on the value of the use of the ASA-PS system in veterinary anaesthesia concluded that dogs, cats and rabbits with ASA-PS scores of 1 or 2 were less likely to die within 24 h (dogs) to 72 h (cats and rabbits) after anaesthesia than animals with ASA-PS scores 3 or greater (Portier & Ida, 2018). Equine anaesthetic risk was not addressed because the reviewed publications did not meet the study 's inclusion criteria; however, the authors commented that other studies have suggested that the ASA-PS classi cation system could be used to identify poor recovery quality from anaesthesia in horses (Dugdale et al.,2016; Niimura Del Barrio et al., 2018; Portier & Ida, 2018). A major concern with utilising the ASA-PS system to identify horses with increased risk for anaesthetic-associated complications is that a number of the factors associated with morbidity and mortality in horses are not accounted for. The ASA-PS system can be used to identify and rank systemic illnesses that could affect anaesthesia, but the majority of horses presented for anaesthesia are generally healthy andare assigned ASA-PS scores of 1 (normal) or 2 (mild systemic disease). Given that the approximate 1% mortality ratereported across most studies represents anaesthesia of healthy horses, there is a room for improvement. We developed a simple rubric to assess EQAR that augments the ASA-PS system with the goal of identifying increased risk in healthy horses so that measures to reduce risk and ultimately reduce morbidity and mortality can be implemented. Materials and methods The rst author (JAEH) initially convened a group of nine equine anaesthesiologists with the goal of developing a risk assessment tool for the evaluation of healthy and diseased horses presented for anaesthesia. The group recognised thatthe ASA-PS system was inadequate for healthy horses and was inconsistently applied, even among the members of the group. Furthermore, other factors in addition to disease status were identi ed that can affect anaesthetic risk in horses. Ultimately, a 2-part system was proposed and titled theCombined Horse Anaesthetic Risk Identi cation and Optimisation Tool (CHARIOT). The rst part (ASA-PS-Equine) of CHARIOT was modelled after the 2014 version of the ASA-PS system (Hurwitz et al., 2017). Commonly recognised equine disease states that represented similar degrees of physical compromise to human diseases listed by the ASA-PS system were proposed with the goal of improving anaesthetic risk assessment and consistency of application ( Table 1 ). The second part of CHARIOT was based on a 10-part rubric that utilised the characteristics of individual horses that have been associated with or determined to in fluence morbidity and mortality in retrospective studies or otherscienti c reports (Bidwell et al., 2007; Dugdale et al., 2016; Johnston, 2005; Johnston et al., 1995, 2002, 2004; Laurenzaet al., 2020; Mee et al., 1998a, 1998b; Senior et al., 2007). The categories included: age, weight, tractability, mobility, pain level, procedure performed, recovery assistance available, anticipated duration of anaesthesia, position during recumbency and abdominal pro le. Baseline risk values were assigned a score of 1 in each category as follows: age (1 to15 years); weight (100 to 700 kg); tractability (easily handled); mobility (normal); pain level (free from pain); procedure (super cial laceration); recovery (personnel available to assist); anticipated duration (30 min); recumbency (lateral)and abdominal pro le (flat). A horse with baseline risk would be given a score of 10 points. Additional items were developed by consensus for each category in order to establish a risk grading system. Items in the age category were as follows: Less than 3 months; 3 months to 1 year; Greater than 15 years. Items in the weight category were as follows: Less than 50 kg; Over 700 kg. Items in the tractability category were as follows: Resistant to handling; Cannot be handled. Items in the mobility category were as follows: Lame on one or more legs; Mild ataxia; Severe ataxia; Recumbent. Items in the pain level category were as follows: Controllable pain; Uncontrollable pain. Items in the Myelography; Arthroscopy; Airway; Fracture Repair; Abdominal exploratory; Ophthalmologic surgery. Items in the recovery category were as follows: Equipment and personnel available to assist; Free recovery. Items in the anticipated duration category were as follows: 30 to 90 min; 90 min to 3 h; greater than 3 h. An additional item in the recumbency category was dorsal (i.e. supine) and an additional item in the abdominal pro le category was round-bellied. \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd.135 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2022A survey was designed to estimate the relative risk of each item within each category. Respondents were asked to assign a score of 1, 2 or 3 to each item to indicate whether an item had the same risk level as the baseline item or represented an elevated risk. A risk score of 1 indicates risk the same as baseline. A risk score of 2 indicates a 2 times greater risk compared to the baseline item. A risk score of 3 indicates a 3 times greater risk compared to the baseline item. The survey along with an electronic message of introduction and intent was sent to a convenience sample of 27 veterinarians (including the authors) with at least 10 years ' experience in equine anaesthesia and a record of scienti c publication in the eld. The electronic message also included a copy of Table 1 for the respondent 's reference. Non- responders were prompted on one or two occasions within a 2-week period. Statistical analysis All data were analysed using a commercially available software (GraphPad Software LLC). The median and range of the scores were calculated and changes in scoring compared to the set baseline of each parameter using Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn 's multiple comparison test. The level of signi cance was set at 5% ( p<0.05). Results Twenty-six of the 27 distributed surveys were completed and returned, a response rate of 96.3%. Countries representedwere Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, England, France, Germany, Japan, Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States of America. The medians and ranges of the scores for each item in each category were calculated and compared to the set baseline. The results are presented with signi cant differences from baseline for each category indicated ( Table 2 ). Scores signi cantly different from baseline were identi ed for items in each of the 10 categories. Signi cant differences between scores for individual items in eight of the categories were also identi ed. Based on these data, scores for each item in each category were determined. Horses less than3 months of age and greater than 15 years of age were assigned scores indicating twice the risk of horses 3 months to 15 years of age. Horses with bodyweights above 700 kg were assigned scores indicating twice the risk of horses with lesser weights. Horses resistant to being managed (i.e. tractable) or unable to be managed were assigned scores indicating twice the risk of easily managed horses. Horses that were mildly ataxic or lame on one or more legs were assigned scores indicating twice the risk of horses with normal mobility. Recumbent horses or horses with severe ataxia were assigned scores indicating three times the risk of horses with normal mobility. Horses that were apparently free from pain or whose pain was controllable (median score 1) were assigned scores indicating less risk than horses with uncontrollable pain (median score 2). Arthroscopy was assigned a procedurescore (1) equal to the baseline (super cial laceration repair).

Fracture repair surgery was assigned a procedure score indicating three times the baseline risk and signi cantly greater risk than arthroscopy (score of 1) or airway surgery (score of 2). Recoveries wherepersonnel and equipment were available to assist were assigned baseline risk (score of 1). Free recoveries were assigned scores indicating twice the risk of assisted recoveries. Anaesthetic durations of less than 90 min were assigned baseline median scores (score of 1). Anaesthetic durations of 90 min to 3 h and greater than 3 h were assigned median scores of 2 and 3, respectively. Horses positioned in dorsal recumbency were assigned scores twice that of horses positioned in lateral recumbency. Round- bellied horses were assigned scores indicating twice the risk of horses with flat bellies.Discussion The results of this survey suggest that experienced equine anaesthesiologists believe that factors other than health and the presence or absence of metabolic disease affect EQAR. In addition, the responses received in each of the 10 categories suggest that the degree of EQAR should be estimated based on patient factors and factors associated with the intended procedure including positioning, anticipated duration and ability or desire to assist recovery. The levels of EQAR suggested by the results of this survey form the basis of a proposed numerical scale (CHARIOT) that utilises the ten factors identi ed to affect EQAR in healthy horses in a format that facilitatescompilation of information estimating the relative risk of a given horse being anaesthetised for a given procedure prior to induction ( Table 3 ).

Equine anaesthetic risk varies with age (Dugdale et al., 2016; Johnston et al., 2002). Horses aged 1 to 15 years were assigned baseline risk (score of 1) by the authors based on retrospective reports. Respondents indicated that horses 3 months to one year of age were not at increased risk but foals less than 3 months of age and horses greater than 15 years of age had twice the risk compared to baseline. Accordingly, CHARIOT was reduced from 4 to 3 items: Less than 3 months (score of 2); 3 months to 15 years (score of 1); Greater than 15 years (score of 2). Equine anaesthetic risk varies with the bodyweight of the horse and its abdominal pro le (Dugdale et al., 2016; Johnston et al., 2002; Moens et al., 1995). The authorsassigned a baseline score of 1 for horses weighing between 100 and 700 kg. Somewhat surprisingly, median score for horses less than 50 kg did not differ from baseline, but horses weighing over 700 kg were scored at a level indicating twice the risk of baseline and horses less than 50 kg. Accordingly, CHARIOT was reduced to two items: Less than 700 kg (score of 1); Greater than 700 kg (score of 2). Abdominal pro le has been associated with greater risk of relative hypoxaemia inanaesthetised horses. Respondents indicated that round bellied horses represented twice the EQAR of flat bellied horses resulting in the proposed CHARIOT scores of 1 for flat- bellied horses and 2 for round-bellied horses. Horses that were resistant to handling or could not be handled were assigned median scores of 2 by therespondents. Accordingly, CHARIOT was reduced to twoitems: Easily handled horses (score of 1); Horses dif cult to be handled (score of 2). Normal mobility was assigned a baseline score by the authors. Respondents assigned horses lame on one or more legs and horses with mild ataxia a median score of 2 but the results were not signi cantly different from baseline. Respondents assigned horses withsevere ataxia and recumbent horses scores of 3, which were signi cantly different from baseline and the other items. After discussion, the authors proposed reducing CHARIOT to threeitems: Normal (score of 1); Lame or mildly ataxic (score of 2); Severely ataxic or recumbent (score of 3). Similarly, horses apparently free of pain or whose pain was controllable were not separated by the respondents, but horses with uncontrollable pain were assigned a median score twice that of the other items. Accordingly, CHARIOT was reduced to two items: Controllable pain (score of 1); Uncontrollable pain (score of 2). The remainder of the identi ed risk categories relate to the procedure to be performed and factors associated with the facilities available and the attending personnel. Respondents assigned median scores of 2 for the items myelography, airway surgery, abdominal exploratory and ophthalmologic surgery and a median score of 3 for fracture repair. Arthroscopy was assigned a median score of 1. The seven items were maintained in CHARIOT with assigned values based on their median scores. Increasing duration of anaesthesia has been identi ed as a source of risk (Bidwell et al., 2007; Dugdale et al., 2016;Johnston, 2005; Johnston et al., 1995, 2002, 2004; Laurenza et al., 2020; Mee et al., 1998a, 1998b; Senior et al., 2007). Respondents indicated that anaesthetic durations less thanTABLE 3: Proposed Combined Horse Anaesthetic Risk Identi cation and Optimisation Tool (CHARIOT) Category Score Age 3 months to 15 years (1)Less than 3 months (2)Greater than 15 years (2)__ Weight Less than 700 kg (1)Greater than 700 kg (2)__ Tractability Easily handled (1)Difcult to (2)__ Mobility or mildly Lateral (1)Dorsal(2)__ Duration Less than 90 min (1)90 min to 3 h(2)Greater than 3 h(3)__ Recovery Assisted EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 202290 min represented baseline risk with durations of 90 min to 3 h representing twice the risk of shorter procedures and procedures greater than 3 h representing three times the risk. Accordingly, CHARIOT was proposed with three items in this category: Anticipated duration less than 90 min (score of 1); Anticipated duration 90 min to 3 h (score of 2); Anticipated duration greater than 3 h (score of 3). Controversy exists with regard to the relative risk of positioning horses in dorsal versus right lateral versus left lateral recumbency for a given procedure (Johnston et al., 2002; Laurenza et al., 2020). Positioning may be determined by the intended procedure but is discretionary in some instances. Regardless, respondents assigned median scores of 2 for dorsal recumbency compared to baseline (non- speci ed lateral recumbency). Two scores were assigned for CHARIOT: Lateral recumbency (score of 1); Dorsalrecumbency (score of 2). Controversy also exists concerning the risk associated with the desire or ability to assist recovery from anaesthesia (Arndt et al., 2019; Kastner, 2010). Respondents scored free recoveries at a risk level twice that of assisted recoveries with or without available equipment so CHARIOT items were reduced to Assisted recovery (score of 1) and Free recovery (score of 2). The goal of this project is to provide a pathway to identify horses at increased EQAR with the ultimate goal of reducing morbidity and mortality associated with anaesthesia. If validated, CHARIOT could be used to amplify the currently employed, but inadequate, ASA-PS scoring system inrecognition that factors in addition to the health of the horse affect EQAR. The baseline CHARIOT score is not proposed at a value of zero because all anaesthetised horses are at risk. The authors postulate that horses with increased CHARIOT scores in multiple categories (Total scores greater than 15) may have pronounced risk compared to horses with scores of 10 (standard risk) and that horses with scores greater than 20 could be at critical risk. If attending personnel recognised an increased EQAR for a given patient, they could potentially modify their procedures (e.g., change recumbency, shorten surgical time, assist recovery) or perhaps refer a patient representing a risk greater than they are prepared to assume. The limitations of this paper include the fact that it is a consensus statement that requires validation and the fact that, whilst numerous factors representing increased EQAR are identi ed, concrete solutions proven to decrease EQAR are not supplied. In addition, the items within the categoriesthat were rated by the respondents are not nuanced or inclusive and as such do not encompass all conditions, procedures or situations. As a result, utilisation of the tool will require some extrapolation and modi cation if operationalised. Further, restricting respondent choices tobaseline, twice the risk, or three times the risk may have oversimpli ed this initial version of the rubric, particularly when assessing risk across categories. Categories and theassociated scores can be added, modi ed or eliminated in the future if others nd utility in the rubric. Some researchers have postulated that EQAR may never be reduced from the reported incidence because of theflight or ght nature of the horse (Dugdale et al., 2016). The authors acknowledge these inherent qualities of the horse butpostulate that morbidity and mortality can be reduced if risk reduction measures are applied. Some have questioned ifestablishing 'standards 'for equine anaesthesia would reduce risk (Senior, 2015). The American College of VeterinaryAnesthesia and Analgesia took a step towards improvinganaesthetic care in horses by proposing guidelines for equine anaesthesia in 2005 (Martinez et al., 2005). Brie fly, the guidelines recognise that horses provide challenges beyondthose of the other domestic animals and provide recommendations for evaluation, selection of anaesthetic regimens, monitoring and supportive care, and recovery. Recommendations include the placement of intravenous catheters, supplemental oxygen, monitoring of arterial blood pressure and treatment of hypotension, and provisions for facilitating an uncomplicated return to standing. The authors believe that wider adoption of these guidelines by appropriately trained individuals across equine practice would represent a much needed improvement in the standard of care for the anaesthetic management of horses.

R. Crabtree* Equine Reproductive Services (UK) Limited, Summary Many llies and mares are accused of behaving badly by their owners or trainers, and their reproductive hormones and ovaries are commonly blamed for this. Overt oestrus behaviour, however natural, is undesirable when a horse is being ridden, trained and competed. More subtle behaviours may be attributed to the reproductive cycle and presented as the cause of poor performance in the elite competition mare. Sometimes behaviours are complex, perhaps at odds with what one expects for normal reproductive behaviour and in many cases may not be associated with the reproductive cycle at all, rather associated with pain of musculoskeletal or soft tissue origin. The situation represents a diagnostic dilemma to positively associate undesirablebehaviours with the ovarian hormones or ovarian pain, before an attempt can be made to modify the behaviour through the suppression of oestrus. This article will review the reasons for presentation, the behavioural patterns of the reproductive cycle and the diagnosis of reproductive behavioural problems. The range of techniques for oestrus suppression will be reviewed along with their clinical application and any known current regulatory issues associated with their use. Introduction In practice, clinicians are commonly presented with mares reportedly behaving 'badly 'be it either persistently, at regular or irregular intervals. This is often presumed by theowners, trainers and/or riders to be due to their mare being in oestrus or because of her ovaries. Behavioural changes in the mare as a result of the in fluence of the hormones that govern cyclicity are a normal behavioural expression for the mareand rather than it being considered 'bad 'behaviour it is better referred to as 'undesirable '. Such behaviour is variably described including a changing attitude, hyper-excitability, an unwillingness to respond to rider instruction, bucking, rearing, squealing, overt oestrus behaviour, aggression to other horses and/or people, stallion-like behaviour and colic (Jorgensen et al . al . 2015). When considering these problems, the behaviour in question must rst be demonstrated to be associated with the ovaries or oestrus cycle, before it can beattributed to it. Often the cause of the problem is unrelated to ovarian activity or pathology and yet it can vary with normal ovarian function and is therefore misattributed to the ovaries (Pryor and Tibary 2005; McDonnell 2017). Other sources of altered behaviour include pain of musculoskeletal, soft tissue, gastric or dental origin, stress, innate temperamental traits and urinary tract infections. If the undesirable behaviour is con rmed to be associated with thefollicular phase of the oestrous cycle then a variety of options are available to suppress oestrus. If behaviour is associated with the luteal phase certain methods may be more appropriate than others. The oestrous cycle and reproductive behaviour The equine species has an endogenous circannual reproductive rhythm which is regulated by photoperiod and synchronised to the spring. There are four de ned phases of cyclic activity: Winter anoestrus (inactive phase), period of cyclic 'seasonal 'activity and an autumn transition (receding phase), back to winter anoestrus. Not all mares stop cycling, and those that do, do not start cycling at the same time nor does the same mare necessarily cycle at the same time each season (Ginther 1992b). Variation would appear to be due to inhibitory factors such as latitude, nutrition, body condition, weight loss, social stress, ambient temperature and reproductive status (Ginther 1992b). Cyclic 'seasonal 'activity is usually from April to September and October to March inthe Northern and Southern Hemispheres respectively (Ginther 1992b). The oestrous cycle consists of a follicular phase (oestrus) and a luteal phase (dioestrus) which in horses last a mean of 6.5 and 14.9 days respectively giving an overall cycle length of 21.7 days (Ginther 1992c). Oestrus behaviour is generally thought of as being driven by oestrogens produced from ovarian follicles (follicular phase), whereas dioestrus behaviour is driven by progesterone produced by luteal structures (luteal phase). In oestrus, the mare demonstrates behaviours which are predominantly submissive and accommodating, whereas indioestrus mares are generally nonreceptive or indifferent through to active avoidance or repulsion of male horses (Ginther 1992a; McDonnell 2017). It is important to note that oestrus behaviour (in response to teasing) is also common in the absence of signi cant follicular development in the transitional and anoestrus phases of the cycle (Ginther 1974;Asa et al . 1980a), when there are low progesterone concentrations. McDonnell (2017) described oestrusbehaviour as being characterised by increased social interest, activity and vocalisation towards the stallion with lifting of the tail off the perineum, increased urination, prolonged bouts of clitoral eversion and posturing. Conversely, dioestrus behaviour is characterised by reduced interest and movement away from the stallion with normal tail posture and urination behaviour; if pressured the mare may squeal or grunt and may strike or kick out with clamping or swishing of the tail. Interestingly fear and pain are characterised by a worried facial expression with a clamped or swishing tail and simultaneous squirting (McDonnell 2017). In the author 's experience, the latter behaviour is commonly displayed by young llies in training in the spring and is attributed by trainers as being due to them being in season along with arequest to modify their behaviour. The demonstration of stallion-like behaviours by mares is rare in the absence of ovarian pathology; however, such behaviours can occur in both the follicular and luteal phases in normal mares (Gastal et al . 2007). Stress and behaviour Riding and training can be a cause of physiological stress which can have potential effects on performance (Bartolom /C19e and Cockram 2016). It is not unsurprising that a mare 's responses to riding and training will vary depending on the stage of the reproductive cycle; however, there is little published information relating to this. Aggressive behaviour is generally associated with testosterone-driven sexual aggression and dominance in males, however, one must acknowledge that stress and testosterone can be physiologically linked. It has been demonstrated that ACTH treatment causes a signi cant increase in plasma levels of cortisol and testosterone in mares (Hedberg et al . 2007a). In addition, Morganti et (2010) demonstrated that serum cortisol was signi cantly higher in mares with elevated testosterone suggesting that adrenal cortical activation may result in increases in both serum cortisol and testosterone and that stress in mares may be associated with some aspects of aggressive or stallion-like behaviour. A study by Dalin et al . (2002a) noted that the mare which was most nervous duringoestrus showed the highest adrenal testosterone response, whereas the calmest mare during oestrus, showed the lowest response. Interestingly mares may have lower cortisol levels in oestrus than in dioestrus (Asa et al . 1983). Ovarian pain Ovarian pain is not easily de ned or quanti ed in the horse; women commonly experience variable degrees of pelvicpain associated with ovulation (Mittelschmerz pain) and primary dysmenorrhoea (menstrual cramps) as well as the pathological conditions of endometriosis, adenomyosis, broids (Won and Abbott 2010) and ovarian cancer (Ebell et al . 2016). It is common for horse owners to anthropomorphise, attributing their own experiences of pain and discomfort to their horses. Since mares do not menstruate, they will not encounter menstrual cramps but it is reasonable to suggest that they encounter pain in relation to large follicular structures and/or ovulation (Cox and DeBowes 1987; assessment of pain in the equine patient can be made by transrectal manual palpation of ovaries (Chenier 2011; Crabtree 2017). Pain during palpation of the ovaries is referred to in the literature (Chenier 2009; Vanderwall and Nie 2011) however, there are no guidelines on how to assess or quantify ovarian pain. In the author 's experience, the majority of mares will not elicit any signi cant response to ovarian palpation; a degree of tenderness associated with the pre- ovulatory follicle is normally anticipated (Chenier 2009; Vanderwall and Nie 2011) however, some mares will demonstrate signi cant discomfort by dropping at thehindquarters, tensing of the abdomen, facial grimaces and turning the head to the side being palpated. Several reports describe colic of ovarian origin (Hooper et al . 1993; Hanson and Tibary 2005; Roessner et al . 2015) and some authors have suggested ovarian pain can lead to sensitivity in the back (Vanderwall and Nie 2011) or hindlimb lameness (Chenier 2009). If these signs are present, repeatable over time and they are associated with pre- ovulatory, large follicular or anovulatory structures, then a 'painful ovary syndrome 'could be considered (Crabtree 2017). In addition, one cannot rule out the potential forneoplastic ovaries to be painful as they are in human subjects (Ebell et al . 2016; Renaudin et al . 2021). Mares suffering from painful ovary syndrome may respond to certainmethods of oestrus suppression where follicular development is suppressed, be that in the follicular or luteal phases. Clinical evaluation The best way to start to investigate this is to ask the owner and/or rider to keep a diary of when the behaviours are occurring, the nature of the behaviours and under what circumstances they are occurring. It is important to determine if the behaviour is better or worse at different times of year. McDonnell (2017) also suggests asking: What is involved; all her body, ears, tail, limbs, mouth? Can you predict when she is going to do it? Can you provoke the behaviour? Can you interrupt the behaviour? Is there any time when she doesn 't exhibit the behaviour? The answers will hopefully allow theclinician to determine if the behaviours are likely associated with oestrus. A thorough physical examination should be performed to identify sources of pain including a lameness workup with particular attention to bilateral hindlimb or multi limb lameness and back or sacroiliac pain. It is important to also check for muscle pain and stiffness, especially those induced by ill- tting tack as lumbar sensitivity or discomfort is often interpreted by owners to be associated with the ovaries. Inthis regard, it is interesting to note that in human patients, musculoskeletal abnormalities may predispose patients to chronic pelvic pain (King et al . 1991) and the same could be true for horses. It is also important to screen for sources ofdental pain, temporo-mandibular joint sensitivity and gastric ulceration. An analgesic trial is a useful adjunct to the physical examination (Pryor and Tibary 2005). In an attempt to differentiate between behavioural issues and subtlelameness mares can be treated systemically with a nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drug (NSAID) such as phenylbutazone whilst continuing to be ridden to see if theytrain better and/or continue to demonstrate undesirable behaviour; an improvement in performance usually indicates a pain-related problem; however, a failure to observe improvement does not preclude pain (Dyson 2016; Pearson 2019). A complete gynaecological examination should be performed at a time when the undesirable behaviours are occurring and also ideally when they are not. Examination would include a transrectal palpation and ultrasound of the ovaries and uterus with particular attention paid to the detection of luteal structures, uterine tone and echo-texture. Uterine tone is higher under the in fluence of progesterone and lower in its absence (Ginther 1992a). The presence ofoedema in the uterus re flects circulating progesterone levels \u00a92020 EVJ Ltd142 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2022of<1 ng/mL and the greater the degree of follicular development, the greater oestrogen concentrations are and the greater the degree of uterine oedema (Loy and Swan 1966; Pycock et al . 1995). Typically oedema peaks 1 -2 days prior to ovulation and decreases immediately prior toovulation (McCue et al . 2011). Mares can however present with an inappropriate level of oedema, where the oedema isgreater than would be expected for the degree of follicular development; this is often seen during the spring transition and may also occur in the face of uterine in flammation (McCue et al . 2011). A visual examination of the cervix with a speculum and/or a manual palpation of the cervix should be performed paying particular attention to the degree of cervical relaxation. In simple terms, a mare in the luteal phase of the cycle will have a pale, dry, rm and closed cervix and a mare in the follicular phase will have areddening, moist, relaxed and open cervix. The cervix gradually relaxes from the beginning of the follicular phase and is maximally relaxed as ovulation approaches (Ginther 1992c). The degree of cervical relaxation can however be variable and the older maiden mare may have a cervix that fails to relax (Pycock 1993). The 'teasing 'of a mare, by bringing her into contact with a stallion, can aid indetermination of the phase of the mare 's oestrus cycle however, this is often not logistically possible or is unsafe inthe non-stud setting. Expression of oestrus by teasing does not necessarily indicate that the mare is in the follicular phase of the oestrous cycle as anoestrus (inactive phase),ovariectomised and pregnant mares may show signs of oestrus upon teasing (Asa et al . 1980a; Asa . 2002b; Imboden et al . 2006). If one was in any doubt regarding the phase of the oestrous cycle a progesterone assay can be performed with levels of <1 ng/mL indicating that the mare is in the follicular or the inactive phase andlevels of >2 ng/mL indicate a patent luteal structure. A mare behaving badly when she is in the follicular phase of theoestrous cycle and behaving well when she is in the luteal phase increases the likelihood that the behaviour is driven, or exaggerated by oestrogen, in the absence of progesterone. If there are any doubts over the presence of ovarian pathology such as granulosa cell tumour (GCT), then diagnostic endocrinology is indicated. Diagnostic endocrinology The GCT panel should include progesterone, testosterone and anti-M \u20acullerian hormone (AMH) to allow differentiation of ovarian enlargement due to large and/or irregular lutealtissue, anovulatory structures, haemorrhagic anovulatory follicles, and (Almeida et al . 2011; Crabtree 2011). Due to the variation in levels of inhibin during theoestrus cycle and the dif culties encountered in GCTs in pregnant mares, serum anti-M \u20acullerian hormone (AMH) has in many cases replaced inhibin in the diagnosis of GCT. Unlike inhibin, there are no signi cant variations in serum AMH concentrations during either the oestrous cycle or pregnancy(Ball et al. 2013; Crabtree et al . 2013), and AMH appears to have a greater sensitivity than inhibin, testosterone, or thecombination of inhibin and testosterone for the diagnosis of GCT (Ball et al . 2014). Elevations in serum AMH concentrations >4 ng/mL seem to be diagnostic for equine GCTs whencompared to normal mare ovaries (Ball et al . 2013; Ball et al . 2014), however recent work has suggested that whencomparing mares with GCT to mares with abnormal ovaries the cutoff values may be in the region of 4.7 ng/mL (Murase et al . 2018). Despite these values, mares with established and histologically con rmed GCTs will likely have signi cantly higher AMH levels (Almeida et al . 2011) and the concentration of AMH will likely be positively correlated totumour weight as it is for Inhibin (Cook 2008; Almeida et al . 2011). Testosterone remains a useful aid in the GCT panel andis elevated in approximately 50% of cases (McCue et al . 2006). It has been suggested previously that mares expressingstallion-like behaviours have testosterone concentrations above 100 pg/mL (0.35 nmol/L; Stabenfeldt et al . 1979) however, this is not absolute, as mares with levels >100 pg/mL may not demonstrate this kind of behaviour (Crabtree 2011) and mares with levels <100 pg/mL may (Bailey et al . 2002). Strategic avoidance Rather than suppressing oestrus, it may be possible in certain scenarios to strategically avoid being in oestrus. For mares which have regular and predictable periods of oestrus, clinicians may be able to induce oestrus with the use of prostaglandin and then induce ovulation, and a subsequent luteal phase, with an ovulation induction agent, prior to competition. Generally, the corpus luteum (CL) is responsive (by means of complete luteolysis) to 'standard 'doses of prostaglandins from 4 to 5 days post-ovulation. On average a mare will return to oestrus 3 -4 days after treatment and ovulate within 8 -10 days. The mare 's 'response 'to prostaglandin administration is governed by the concurrent follicular activity present at the time of administration (Crabtree 2009). For instance, a mare with no signi cant follicular activity at the time of prostaglandin administration isgoing to be slower to 'respond 'than a mare which concurrently has a CL and a 35 mm follicle. As a generalrule, a mare with a growing follicle of 35 mm or greater in diameter combined with a maximal endometrial oedema pattern and a relaxing cervix should respond to an ovulation induction agent. Oestrus suppression methods Therapies to suppress oestrus can be divided into ve categories depending on the mode of action. Methods caneither mimic a state of dioestrus, by supplementing progesterone or a synthetic analogue, cause a prolongation of the natural luteal phase, suppress ovarian activity through suppression of GnRH or by induction of anti-GnRH antibodies or remove the ovarian in fluence totally via ovariectomy. Methods to mimic a state of dioestrus Progesterone supplementation Supplementation of progesterone or the synthetic analogue altrenogest (allyltrenbolone) can be used as a diagnostic trial and as a therapy. If a horse has a behavioural improvement whilst on altrenogest, it could be assumed that the oestrogen-dependant behaviour has been 'neutralised 'as progesterone can be considered 'dominant 'over oral altrenogest (Regumate1) will suppress behavioural oestrus in mares within 2 -3 days by creating an articial luteal phase for as long as it is administered. When prescribing such treatment, one should be aware of the potential for cross contamination of other horses and human \u00a92020 EVJ Ltd143 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2022subjects administering the product. In addition, mares being administered altrenogest for long periods may be outside of the product data sheet recommendations and consideration should be given to periodic screening of the reproductive tract for uterine infection. It should be noted that some mares which are unresponsive to the 'standard 'dose of 0.044 mg/ kg may be increased to a 'double dose 'of 0.088 mg/kg. In considering this a direct 'calming 'affect at a higher (CNS) level should be acknowledged (Roberts and Beaver 1987),which is supported by the fact that progestagens are also often effective at curbing unwanted sexual or aggressive behaviour in geldings (McDonnell 2000). It is important to recognise that follicular development and ovulation is not reliably suppressed by altrenogest at the standard dose and therefore mares that have painful ovary syndrome may continue to show discomfort even though other behavioural signs of oestrus have been suppressed (Lofstedt and Patel 1989; Pryor and addition altrenogest, long-acting injectable formulations of progesterone or altrenogest are available from compounding pharmacies in different parts of the world. Such preparations have been demonstrated to 'suppress 'oestrus behaviour for a period of 7 days (Vanderwall et al . 2003; McConaghy et al. 2016). Anecdotal reports of injection site reactions and the subsequent potential for coat colourchanges should be considered when prescribing such medications. Progesterone releasing intra-vaginal devices could be considered for the use of oestrus suppressionhowever their side effects may be undesirable in the competition mare compared to the broodmare (Crabtree et al . 2018). Other 'off-label 'animal and human products such as progesterone and (Nexplanon6) have been used anecdotally; some have been investigated experimentally and shown to demonstrate limited or no clinical effect (McCue et al . 1997; McKinnon et al . 2000; Gee et al . 2009; Hazan 2011). It is important to note that such compounds are considered'prohibited 'or'banned 'under many codes. In late 2018 it was reported in international racing jurisdictions that trace levels of the anabolic steroids trenbolone and/or trendione had been detected in products which contain altrenogest. Anabolic steroids are 'prohibited at all times 'under the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) rules of racing in the United Kingdom and their investigations revealed the oral altrenogest (Regumate 1) and injectable altrenogest (Altrenogest injection7) contained traces of trendione. Subsequent to this, the BHA advised owners and trainers not to administer any product containing altrenogest to a Thoroughbred from birth until permanent retirement from racing and that detection of trenbolone/trendione in a sample from a horse may result in a 14-month suspension from racing, in essence the use of altrenogest was 'banned '. Altrenogest is a synthetic 17-alkylated form nandrolone (19-nortestosterone); trenbolone is an estrane derivative alkylation of trenbolone results in allyltrenbolone (altrenogest). It would appear that the anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) trenbolone and trendione are present as impurities in altrenogest containing productsthrough incomplete alkylation of trenbolone of trenbolone to trendione. Concerns thataltrenogest itself acts as an AAS exist but remain unproven. Hodgson et al . (2005), administered altrenogest at 0.044 mg/ kg for 8 weeks to sedentary mares and reported nodemonstrable effect on dominance hierarchies, body mass or body condition score. They concluded that altrenogest had no obvious anabolic effects that may affect the performance of a competition mare. Regumate 1is currently allowed in mares under F /C19ed/C19eration Equestre Internationale (FEI) rules without any additional certi cation. Methods to prolong the natural luteal phase Occasionally a primary CL will fail to regress during the expected time of luteolysis. Such persistent CLs occur in 8 - 10% of oestrous cycles during the peak of the ovulatoryseason and about 25% during the autumn months (King et al . 2010). Such idiopathic or spontaneous luteal persistence willresult in a luteal phase that can persist for up to 90 days before natural regression of the CL (Stabenfeldt et al . 1974). Methods to prevent luteolysis will therefore result insuppression of oestrus by continued endogenous progesterone production from the persistent CL. The 'anti-luteolytic 'effect of oxytocin When the peptide hormone oxytocin is administered in themid-luteal phase before Day 10 after ovulation it often disrupts luteolysis, causing prolonged CL function (Goff et al. 1987). Vanderwall et al . (2007) demonstrated that the intramuscular administration of 60 IU of oxytocin (Oxytocin-s 1) twice daily on Days 7 -14 after ovulation was an ef cacious method of inhibiting luteolysis and extending CL function. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that 60 IU oxytocin once daily was equally ef cacious with 63% of mares experiencing prolonged luteal function compared to 71% in twice dailytreated mares (Vanderwall et al . 2012), and this has become the 'standard 'treatment. Such protocols rely on the day of ovulation being known. If this is unknown, 60 IU oxytocin can be administered for 29 consecutive days which will, in themajority of mares, encompass the crucial period 7 -14 days after ovulation, with an anticipated response of over 70%(Parkinson et al . 2015). As an alternative, Sarnecky et al . (2019) evaluated a proprietary slow-release oxytocinformulation. Mares received 1.0 mL of slow-release oxytocin containing 2400 IU oxytocin intramuscularly once on Day 7 and again on Day 10 after ovulation. Luteal persistence characterised by progesterone concentrations remaining >1.0 ng/mL continuously for at least 30 days was demonstrated in 75% of treated mares. This is potentially a more practical treatment protocol with only two injections compared to eight using the standard treatment protocol. Theoretically, if the date of ovulation was unknown, 10 injections of a long-acting preparation, every 3 days may prove potentially ef cacious. Oxytocin is 'allowed 'under the BHA rules and is a 'controlled medication' under FEI rules. The short half-life of oxytocin of 6.8 min (Paccamonti et al . 1999) would suggest that a relatively short withholding period couldbe applied for competition and the Nordic Equine Medication and Anti-doping Committee (NEMAC) currently publishes a withhold period of 96 h. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) Glass, copper, silver and water- lled plastic balls have been studied, with ef cacy varying from 0 to 75% of mares \u00a92020 Ltd144 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / prolonged luteal phases (Nie et al . 2001; Nie et al . 2003; Meyer 2003; Alamo et al . 2008; Argo and Turnbull 2010). The rst study by Nie et al . (2001) reported 41.7% (n =12) of mares experienced prolonged luteal function which lasted a mean of 88.8 days when a 35mm glass ball was inserted within 24 h of ovulation. In a later publication, the same team reported 39% (n =18) mares experienced prolonged luteal function; this was made up ofmares experiencing extended phases immediately after ball placement and after the second and third ovulatory cycles (Nie et al. 2003). Interestingly the 61% of mares which did not experience prolonged luteal function continued to cyclenormally for four cycles after which the ball was removed. It should be noted that in both reports, mares received a 250\u00b5g dose of cloprostenol at ball insertion which was also post-ovulation and may have interfered with lutealdevelopment (Mocklin et al . 2006). Rivera del Alamo et al . (2008) placed 20 mm water- lled plastic spheres (estimated to be approximately 7.8 g) into the uterus 2 -4 days post- ovulation and induced a prolonged luteal phase in 75%(n=12) of the mares with a mean luteal phase of 57.0 days. Argo and Turnbull (2010) however, demonstrated noextended luteal phases in 12 cycles for each of 4 Pony mares when 35 mm glass balls were inserted. Did these mares not respond because of their breed, because they were all members of a subset of 'nonresponders' , or due to a difference in IUD or insertion technique? The answer is notclear but the authors introduced the idea that clinical orowner impression was a manifestation of 'placebo by proxy '. A mechanism for luteal persistence in the presence of an IUD is as yet undetermined. No signi cant differences have been demonstrated between endometrial biopsy samplesprior to placement and post-removal of the devices (Nie et al . 2001; Nie et al . 2003; Rivera del Alamo et al . 2008; Argo and Turnbull 2010). Rivera del Alamo et al . (2008) proposed that close contact of the IUD with the endometrium may prevent the endometrial cells from releasing PGF 2-alpha since their responder mares showed baseline PG metabolite levels from Day 14 post-ovulation, whilst the control and nonresponder mares showed increased levels. Klein et al . (2016) used the same IUD and insertion technique to furtherelucidate the mode of action of IUDs. They encountered luteal persistence in 46.7% (n =15) mares but were however unable to demonstrate the mechanism for it. They suggestedthat the variable ef cacy of IUDs in mares may possibly be influenced by mare age and the presence of endometrial angiopathies. The relatively widespread use of glass marbles for this purpose has led to cases of whole or fractured marbles acting as foreign bodies with or without associated uterine infection (Klabnik-Bradford et al . 2013; Turner et al . 2015; de Amorim et al. 2016; Morris et al. 2017) and the concurrent presence of two glass marbles have been associated with urogenital discomfort and recurrent colic (Vanderwall 2013; Freeman and Lyle 2015). In addition, they have developed a reputation for being dif cult to remove, which is likely due to the glass surface being damaged, making it porous andallowing brovascular ingrowth. As a result, glass marbles are not recommended for this purpose (Vanderwall 2015) andsterile water- lled or solid plastic spheres are a suggested alternative. Regardless of this, some feel that devices left in situ, perhaps accidentally, for long periods of time represent a risk to uterine health, especially if they result in aprolonged luteal state. The author is aware of anecdotal reports of a range of inappropriate devices either being placed, or found, in the uterus and this practice is perhaps giving the use of all IUDs a bad reputation. The use of sterile medical grade 35 mm polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) spheres weighing approximately 26 g has been described and client satisfaction appears to be good (Crabtree 2019), consistent with eld observations of others (Burger et al . 2008). The PMMA spheres, like glass balls, are readily detectable bytransrectal palpation and they cast a similar characteristic acoustic shadow to glass upon ultrasound (Diel de Amorim et al . 2017). In the author 's clinical experience, they are most likely found at the base of a uterine horn howeveroccasionally they can go undetected if they occupy a ventral position in a pendulous uterus (Diel de Amorim et al. 2017). It should be noted that there are no published studiesinto the long-term presence of any of these devices in the uterus of mares and, therefore, if they are to be used, it is recommended that they are removed at the end of the physiological breeding season. In comparison to glass balls, the author has removed a limited number of the PMMA devices after being in situ for more than 12 months without damage to the sphere, nor any notable adverse effects on uterine health and future pregnancy, supported by limited pregnancy data in experimental mares post IUD removal (Nie et al . 2003; Gradil et al . 2019). More recently a self-assembling device consisting of three polymer-coated magnets has been described to successfullyprolong luteal function and suppress oestrus (Gradil et al . 2019). The devices consist of three 12 926 mm polymer- coated elliptical elements with a magnetic core which results in the elements self-assembling into a 'ring '. This arrangement has the advantage of being able to be placed into theuterus and retrieved via an applicator and magnetic retriever, in addition their metal core allows their presence to be detected using an external metal detector. Gradil et al . (2019) reported 85.7% (n =12) mares experienced extended luteal function and the average luteal phase was 74.1/C611.1 days. Further study is necessary but this particular form of IUD shows promise as an effective method of oestrussuppression. Currently, to the author 's knowledge, there appears to be no published regulatory opinion on the use ofIUDs other than NEMAC who state 'no withdrawal time 'for 'intrauterine implants for delaying oestrus '. Intrauterine coconut oil A report by Wilsher and Allen (2011a) reported an inadvertent nding of an experimental study into the maternal recognition of pregnancy. Oestradiol in fractionated coconutoil was infused into the uterus of mares at Day 10 post- ovulation and in 92% (n =12) of mares, luteolysis was blocked. Controls demonstrated that oestradiol was notnecessary to block luteolysis and coconut or peanut oilsalone induced 92% (n =12) luteal persistence. The ability of the treatment to block luteolysis was not signi cantly different when administered on Day 8 (9/12; 75%), 12 (10/12; 83%) or 14 (6/12; 50%) of dioestrus but declined signi cantly when given before Day 8. Despite this initial report other researchershave failed to repeat these results with 0% (n =5; Diel de Amorim et al =6; Campbell et al . 2017) of mares demonstrating prolonged luteal phases with coconut and peanut oils respectively. Campbell et al . (2017) demonstrated super cial erosion of the Ltd145 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / in all mares and signi cantly increased eosinophil numbers in the endometrium of mares, postinfusion of peanut oil. They also demonstrated, in at least one mare, that the infusion resulted in a signi cant uterine reaction with the formation of fluid. Campbell 's and Diel de Amorim 's groups either tested or ltered their oils for bacterial contamination however it raises the question if there could have been othercontaminants such as endotoxins in the oils used? If Campbell et al . (2017) ndings are consistent then mares may have a hypersensitivity type reaction to the infusion ofoil. The technique has been used clinically with success in low numbers (Crabtree 2019). The author described the clinical use of 1.0 mL of pharmaceutical-grade fractionated coconut oil which was passed through a 22 micron lter and infused into the uterus using a Minit \u20acub insemination pipette 8with an inner catheter in a clean fashion on Day 9 -11 post-ovulation. Some effort was placed into determining the exact day ofovulation and often an ovulation induction agent was used to provide some accuracy into the detection of day of ovulation. Client feedback was positive (Crabtree 2019); however, one cannot rule out the placebo by proxy effect. Campbell et al . (2017) suggested that 'oils 'may be considered 'medicines 'by the regulatory authorities. To the author 's knowledge, there is no current published regulatory opinion on the use of intrauterine oil(s) however, substances'not-approved 'by medicines agencies are considered 'prohibited 'under many codes. Inducing dioestrus ovulation A study by Hedberg et al . (2006) looked at induction of dioestrus ovulation to induce a prolonged luteal phase. It appeared to be possible to induce ovulation of a dioestrus follicle 30 mm using 3000 IU human Chorulon1). Three of four hCG-treated mares ovulated within 72 h after treatment and developed prolonged luteal phases of 58, 68 and 82 days respectively (Hedberg et al . 2006). Theoretically one could use a GnRH analogue for thesame purpose. Human CG is allowed under many codes however an appropriate withhold period may need to be applied. Termination of early pregnancy Lefranc and Allen (2003), reported the results of a study in Welsh pony and Cob-type mares whereby concepti were manually ruptured between Days 16 and 22. The CL persisted morphologically in all the mares and serum progesterone concentrations remained >1 ng/mL for a mean of 82/C613 days (range 64 -109 days). Theoretically if pregnancy termination was delayed to after the establishment of the endometrial cups, between 36 and 38 days of gestation (Allen et al . 1973), then the continued secretion of equine Chorionic Gonadotropin (eCG) would prolong the lutealphase even further, until the degeneration of the endometrial cups between 105 and 150 days (Wilsher and Allen 2011b). However, there would be potential complications associated with a later termination and there are obvious ethical considerations to the termination of pregnancy for this purpose and concerns of how this would be perceived by the public and subsequently sport regulatory authorities. Another option would be to leave the mare pregnant; a number of llies in training will be put in foal and continue to compete whilst they are pregnant due to a perceivedincrease in performance (British Horseracing Authority 2008;Blake 2017) and the BHA allows llies/mares to run until 120 days of gestation. Suppression of ovarian activity through suppression of GnRH It has been noted in some mares that the use of Ovuplant implants9(2.1 mg deslorelin acetate) cause a prolongation of the subsequent inter-ovulatory interval if they did notbecome pregnant (Johnson et al . 2000; Morehead and Blanchard 2000), due to a negative feedback on thehypothalamic-pituitary axis. This mechanism has been adapted for oestrus suppression. An experiment by Johnsonet al . (2003), demonstrated that mares receiving three implants had prolonged luteal phases with a mean of36.8 days, compared with mares receiving a single implant (22.5 days). Clinically one can appreciate mixed results depending on the degree of the individual mare 's sensitivity to down-regulation (Crabtree 2019). Ovuplant is an effectiveovulation induction agent so if administered to a mare with a responsive follicle it will be effective at 'ending 'the follicular phase. In practice, the author starts with two implants and ifrepeat treatment is necessary considers increasing the dose to three implants (Crabtree 2019). Anecdotally the more concentrated form, marketed for dogs and ferrets as Suprelorin 10(4.7 mg deslorelin acetate), has been used clinically off-licence. Recently Kaps et al . (2021) published a study looking at down-regulation of pituitary GnRH receptors and subsequent inhibition of ovulation and oestrus behaviour in Shetland mares using one or two 4.7 mg Suprelorin10 implants. There was a transient inhibition of ovulation whichwas approximately equivalent to one and two oestrous cycles for the 4.7 mg (one implant) and 9.5 mg (two implant) groups, respectively. The mean number of days with oestrus behaviour was signi cantly less in treated mares when compared to controls; however, there were considerabledifferences in response between individuals in agreement with the author 'seld observations. Deslorelin is not listed as a prohibited substance with the FEI; the BHA rules of racing state 'a horse must not have any implant, unless the implant is pharmacologically inactive 'and as such should be free from deslorelin on raceday. It is difcult to compose an appropriate withdrawal period when multiple implants are used. GnRH antagonists such asantarelix and cetrorelix are not really a practical therapy for oestrus suppression in the mare, despite being reversible, asdaily therapy of large doses (relative to human patients) are required making them relatively expensive (Evans et al . 2002; Briant et al . 2003). Suppression of ovarian activity through induction of anti-GnRH antibodies GnRH vaccination has become popular in competition horses for suppression of oestrus. A GnRH vaccine is commercially available in Australasia (Equity oestrus control vaccine11) for the control of oestrus and oestrus-related behaviour in mares,not intended for breeding. In addition, the vaccine GonaCon-Equine 12is approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, for contraception of feralhorses and burros (Killian et al . 2008; Baker et al . 2018).

Burger 2020). Mares cease all ovarian activity within approximately 4 weeks of the second injection of a primary course and remain suppressed for a variable amount of time (Imboden et al . 2006; Elhay et al . 2007; Schulman et al . 2013). The younger the mare is when vaccinated the longer thereturn to cyclicity is likely to be (Schulman et al . 2013). In a study by Imboden et al . (2006) of nine mares vaccinated twice, ve returned to ovulatory activity from 28 to 100 weeks, three resumed follicular activity without ovulatingand one remained inactive over the 100 weeks observation period. They concluded that the duration of the inhibitory effect is highly variable, not clearly related to GnRH antibody titres and resumption of ovulatory activity may require more than 100 weeks. Mares vaccinated against GnRH can however also demonstrate oestrus behaviour after ovarian inactivation (Dalin et al . 2002b; Imboden et al . 2006), which is not unsurprising as the prevailing hormone pattern is that ofan anoestrus mare. Given the suppression of folliculogenesis it is likely that a mare with ovarian pain syndrome will respond to this therapy. There is great variation in an individuals 'response to vaccination (Stout and Colenbrander 2004; Schulman et al . 2013) and it is not known how long mares that receiverepeated doses of vaccine (boosters) will remain inactive for. The author 's clinical experience suggests there is potential for the effect to be longstanding or potentially permanent whichis consistent with the observations of others (Burger et al . 2008; Burger 2020). In the study by Imboden et al. (2006) 1 of 9 vaccinated mares did not remain completely suppressedfor the entire duration of 60 months of the study. Schulman et al . (2013) reported that 7.8% of mares did not resume cyclicity within 2 years after only receiving two doses ofvaccine. For this reason, vaccination is not recommended in mares intended for future breeding and the author recommends that clients sign an 'off-label 'authorisation form, stating that they understand that the mare may not beable to breed in the future. The porcine vaccine (Improvac 3) is associated with variable but signi cant injection site reactions (Imboden et al. 2006; Botha et al. 2008). Approximately 90% of horses vaccinated into the neckdevelop pyrexia after initial vaccination and approximately 30% develop painful and swollen necks. On boosting, approximately 80% of horses react with painful, swollen and stiff necks, necessitating concurrent nonsteroidal anti- inflammatories at vaccination; additionally, two deaths have been encountered presumably due to anaphylactic shockrepresenting an estimated 0.2% risk (Imboden et al . 2006; Burger 2020). Vaccination into the gluteal muscle mayreduce the occurrence of vaccine reaction (Botha et al . 2008). The equine licensed vaccine Equity 11on the other hand, has been demonstrated to be safe when administered intramuscularly in the neck (Elhay et al . 2007; Janett et al . 2009) and for this reason its use is recommended over theporcine licensed Improvac 3in competition horses (Burger et al . 2008; Crabtree 2019; Burger 2020). Equity11can be imported to the UK under a special import licence given appropriate justi cation. According to European Union regulations, all vaccines administered by a veterinary surgeon must be recorded in the horse 's passport regardless of whether or not the horse is intended for human consumption (Commission Regulation 2008). Therefore, administration of a GnRH vaccine should be recorded, but in reality, this is suspected not to be alwayshappening and mares which have received one or more doses of the vaccine are being sold and presented by a new owner for breeding. To the author 's knowledge, there is no published study looking at subsequent reproductiveperformance in vaccinated mares however, doubts exist over future reproductive potential (Imboden et al. 2006; Crabtree 2019; Burger 2020). In the author 's clinical experience, resumption of follicular development in vaccinated mares is not necessarily accompanied by normal cyclicity. Not unlike the transitional phase, follicular activity can develop, but they do not necessarily progress through to ovulation (Imboden et al . 2006). If an ovulation is detected it is not necessarily followed by a resumption to normal cyclic pattern. Screeningfor anti-GnRH antibodies is possible (Bailly-Chouriberry et al . 2017) but commercially in Europe this service is currently onlyavailable for sport horses and limited availability in Thoroughbreds (Bailly-Chouriberry 2020, personal communication). As previously stated, the inhibitory effect is not clearly related to GnRH antibody titres (Imboden et al . 2006) however, antibodies are long-lasting (Burger 2020) andso antibody screening will likely give an indication if any vaccinations have historically taken place. The FEI does not list GnRH vaccination in the equine- prohibited substances list and although it was previously advised that GnRH vaccination usage should be recorded in the horse 's FEI passport this advice has now been withdrawn. The BHA Veterinary Committee advises 'Immuno-sterilisation should not be permitted in horses intended for racing in theUK'and the rules state that 'only vaccines licensed against infectious agents are permitted 'therefore, the use of a GnRH vaccine is excluded under this rule. NEMAC lists GnRH vaccination under 'other prohibited treatments and substances. ' Suppression of oestrus by ovariectomy The author has reviewed the published evidence for ovariectomy in the management of undesirable behaviours elsewhere (Crabtree 2016; Crabtree 2017). Three studies of bilateral ovariectomy for behavioural reasons have been published to date (Hooper et al . 1993; Kamm and Hendrickson 2007; Roessner et al. 2015). Hooper et al . (1993) reported that 35% of mares ovariectomised demonstrated continued oestrus behaviour and in 9% of cases this was judged to be 'objectionable 'by the owners. Kamm and Hendrickson (2007) reported that 22% of owners were either impartial or dissatis ed; mainly due to a failure of behavioural change following surgery. In the study by Roessner et al . (2015) bilateral ovariectomy was associated with a better outcome than that of altrenogest therapy however the dose of altrenogest received by mares was highly variable and no endocrinological screening nor histopathological analysis of removed ovaries was performed. Recent work published by Melgaard et al . (2020), reported a series of 10 mares with histopathologically normal ovaries that underwentovariectomy for behavioural reasons. Post ovariectomy an 80% improvement in 'rideability 'and 40% improvement in behaviour towards people and/or other horses was reportedfrom an owner 's perspective. Inclusion criteria required there to be no extra-ovarian primary pathology and included trialtherapy with NSAIDs and altrenogest. No response to NSAID or altrenogest made the mare a candidate for surgery. It is not clear what subset of mares these criteria selected \u00a92020 EVJ Ltd147 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2022however, questions were related to, flank sensitivity, kicking, biting, bucking and rearing. In summary, if the undesirable behaviour which prompts ovariectomy is normal sexual (oestrus) behaviour then the likelihood is that surgery will not correct the problem. In fact, ovariectomy may make the situation worse as oestrus behaviour may become irregular and/or persistent post- surgery (Asa et al . 1980a; Hedberg et al . 2007b). Why is this? It was suggested by Asa et al . (1980a) that the luteal ovary plays a controlling role in the inhibition of oestrus behaviour, with progesterone providing the mechanism for periodic inhibition of sexual behaviour during dioestrus, that is the mares 'default 'position is one of receptivity. Given peri- ovulatory oestrus is more vigorous than that observed inovariectomised or anovulatory mares, it was hypothesised that additional steroidal stimulation is supplied by the ovarian follicles in the days just prior to ovulation. Alternatively, if we assume that the mares 'default setting is one of neutral behaviour then additional oestrogens are acting to stimulatethis behaviour with the adrenal gland being the most likely source; phytoestrogens of dietary origin are also a potential source (Asa et al. 1980a; Asa et al . 1980b; Weng et al. 2007). If the behaviour that prompts ovariectomy is aggressive incharacter then ovariectomy is more likely to be a successful therapy, but the evidence for this is weak (Crabtree 2017; Melgaard et al . 2020). Ovariectomy may well be indicated and curative for ovarian pain syndrome however, inducingovarian inactivity via the use of a GnRH vaccine may also bea viable option that does not require surgery. In order to predict the mares 'response to ovariectomy, Roessner et al . (2015) compared ovariectomy to previous response to therapy with altrenogest. As discussed byCrabtree (2017), this is a potentially flawed approach as altrenogest therapy, mimics the luteal phase whereasovariectomy more closely resembles the inactive anoestrus phase, therefore observing the mare 's behaviour in anoestrus would be a more appropriate predictor of response tosurgery. Regardless of the reason for performing ovariectomy, it would be prudent to warn an owner of the possibility of intermittent or persistent signs of oestrus behaviour post- surgery. From a regulatory perspective the BHA rules that as a 'requirement of running 'a mare or lly must not have undergone laparoscopic sterilisation, unless she hasundergone the procedure for therapeutic reasons. It is assumed that ovariectomy for oestrus suppression is not a therapeutic reason? The author is not aware of any other ruling regarding ovariectomy and subsequent competition. Caslick' s procedure A study by Christoffersen et al . (2007) reported on the use of a Caslick 's procedure in the management of referred vaginal pain as a cause of behavioural problems in mares. Fourteen mares exhibiting performance problems such as kicking against the rider 's legs, bolting, or refusing to move forward were selected for this study. Performance problems orstereotypic behaviour were observed either permanently or intermittently during oestrus. In 86% (n =14) of mares, the performance problems were totally eliminated or diminishedwithin 6 months after a Caslick 's operation (Christoffersen et al . 2007). As a result of this study, all mares undergoing oestrus suppression therapy should be critically appraised forvulval conformation and pneumovagina and have a Caslick 's procedure performed if appropriate. Conclusions In conclusion, evaluation of mares for undesirable behaviouris a complex and in-depth process to determine if the undesirable behavioural patterns being experienced are caused by the reproductive cycle and the prevailing hormone balance or not. It may take time and a number of examinations to come to a conclusion and one needs to get to grips with the sometimes complex relationship between owner, trainer, rider and mare. Mares may demonstrateundesirable behavioural traits in the follicular or the luteal phase or both. If the behaviours are not caused directly by the reproductive cycle, the mare may simply cope better with training or competition stresses when she is in, or out of season. The choice of appropriate oestrus suppression technique will vary on many factors including the phase of the cycle one is trying to mimic, response to trial therapy with altrenogest, patient compliance, future breeding potential of the mare, cost, competition schedule and regulatory considerations. Some suppression techniques are reversible whereas other solutions may have a longstanding or permanent effect. Author 's declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Deutsch*and P. M. Taylor Langford Veterinary Services, Bristol; andTaylor Monroe, and morbidity are of interest to anaesthetists, practitioners, horse owners and insurance companies. The largest prospective study, 'The Con dential Enquiry into Perioperative Equine Fatalities '(CEPEF) was conducted more than 20 years ago. It included over 40,000 horses from multiple centres and reported mortality to be 1.9% that decreased to 0.9% when only elective cases were considered. This is in stark contrast to mortality rates in small animal (dogs: 0.17%, cats: 0.24%) and human anaesthesia (0.04 -7/10,000). In of developments in understanding the pathophysiology of equine anaesthesia mortality has notdecreased in the intervening years. The main contributors to peri-anaesthetic equine mortality are cardiac arrest, fracturesand myopathy or neuropathy. Spinal cord myelopathy and cerebral necrosis are less common. Malignant hyperthermia and hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis are diseases associated with genetic mutations that can be triggered during general anaesthesia and may be fatal if not recognised and treated immediately. Morbidities are reported less frequently, presumably because often they do not cause permanent harm and may resolve within a short period of time. Complications in equine anaesthesia are numerous and include injuries at induction and recovery, damage to the airway associated with orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation, post-anaesthetic myopathy or neuropathy, regurgitation and aspiration of with intravascular cannulation. Hypotension, hypoventilation, hypoxaemia, hypothermia and dysrhythmias may occur both during the maintenance phase of anaesthesia but also in recovery. Airway obstruction during recovery has repeatedly been reported over the years as causing pulmonary oedema, which is often fatal if the airway is not restored extremely quickly. This review summarises the literature on the risk of mortality and morbidity. Information has been gathered from single case reports as well as larger research studies. Introduction Equine general anaesthesia is associated with a highincidence of mortality compared with dogs and cats (Johnston et al . 1995; Johnston et al . 2002; Brodbelt et al . 2008) and humans (Haller et al . 2011). In dogs, the mortality rate has been reported to be one in 601 and in cats one in 419 (Brodbelt et al . 2008), whereas in humans it ranges between 0.04 and 7 per 10,000 anaesthetics (Haller et al . 2011). The 'Con Peri-anaesthetic Equine Fatalities '(CEPEF), a large multi-centre prospective study, described an overall peri-anaesthetic mortality rate of around one in 100 (one in nearer 50 if emergencies were included)(Johnston et al . 2002). Other smaller single-centre studies reported overall mortality ranging from at one in 150 to onein 830 (Young and Taylor 1993; Mee et al . 1998a; Bidwell et al . 2007), but more recently mortality is still reported as aroundone in 100 (Jago et al . 2015; Dugdale et al . 2016; Laurenza et al. 2020). This is in contrast to human medicine wheremortality rates are continuously decreasing (Haller et al . 2011). As in human medicine however, the range of mortalityrates may be explained by the lack of standardised de nition of anaesthesia related mortality, the chosen duration of theperi-anaesthetic period, the variety of the case load, and in horses, the inclusion criteria for cases that were subjected to euthanasia (Haller et al . 2011). In CEPEF, for elective cases, the most common causes of peri-operative death were cardiac arrest (33%), catastrophicfractures in recovery resulting in euthanasia (26%) and unspeci ed abdominal causes (13%). Post-anaesthetic myopathy for 7% of fatalities, and spinalcord myelopathy (SCM) or central nervous system complications for 6% (Johnston et al . 2002). Similarly, Bidwell et al. (2007) reported fractures and cardiac arrest as themain causes of mortality, followed by PAM. Fatalities predominantly occurred during the recovery period (Johnston et al . 2002; Dugdale et al . 2016; Laurenza et al . 2020). For horses undergoing abdominal surgery, a range of mortality rates has been reported, ranging from around 2 to30% (Mee et al . 1998b; Johnston et al . Proudman et al Johnston et and Smith 2005a; al . 2020; Laurenza et al . 2020). Horses presented for caesarean section were also shown to have increased mortality risk (Johnston et al . 1995). Small retrospective studies reported a mortality rate ofaround 10 to 20% for this patient group (Juzwiak et al. 1990; Freeman et al . 1999; haemoabdomen, cardiovascular collapseassociated with sepsis, vaginal/uterine tears; euthanasia or death related to the surgery were also included contributing to the high mortality rate (Juzwiak et al . 1990; Freeman 2012; Rioja et al . 2012). Factors increasing the risk of mortality have been identi ed as increasing age (Johnston et al . 2002; Dugdale et al . 2016), out of hours surgery (Johnston et al . 2002), higher American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) physical status gradeand longer duration of anaesthesia (Johnston et al . 1995; Dugdale et al reduced the risk ofmortality, whilst lack of premedication, romi dine alone and use of volatile agents as a sole anaesthetic agent increasedthe risk (Johnston et al . 2002). . 2006; Adami et al 2020), re flux, acidosis and duration of anaesthesia were identi ed as risk factors for mortality (Adami et al . 2020). Patient harm and associated costs include not only patient mortality but also anaesthesia related morbidity. Mortality and morbidity are tightly enmeshed and are best investigated together to assess patient safety (Haller et al . 2011). While considerable effort has been spent identifyingrisk factors for the high risk of equine anaesthetic death, morbidity is often neglected although reported to be between 1 and 18% (Young and Taylor 1993; Johnston et al . 2004; et al . 2016; Laurenza et al . 2020). This is comparable to incidences of minor morbidity in humans where numbers reach 18 -22% (Bothner et al. 2000; Fasting and Gisvold 2003) and include post-operative nausea and vomiting, dental damage,trauma to the pharynx, drug administration error and problems with anaesthetic equipment (Haller et al . 2011). However, intermediate and major morbidities, such asneuropathies (3%) and paraplegia after spinal or epidural anaesthesia (0.6 -0.9/10,000) or brain injury (0.9/10,000) and cardiac arrest (3.3/10,000), respectively, are less common(Haller et al . 2011). In comparison, morbidities in small animal anaesthesia are described in 2% to 50% of cases (Dyson et al . 1998; Redondo et al . 2007; Gruenheid et 2018). The recognised problems associated with data collectionregarding mortality in humans are likely to be similar in otherspecies and may apply to morbidity as well (Haller et al . 2011). Morbidity may increase the duration of hospitalisation, costs, affect the future performance of the horse and, inworst case scenarios, lead to euthanasia. In equine anaesthesia, few studies have investigated morbidity, but numerous case reports describe complications occurring in the peri-anaesthetic period. Hence, this review summarises information obtained not only from larger prospective and retrospective studies but also from case reports. Complications not speci cally addressed but described Laurenza et al . 2020). Injuries to humans Injuries to the anaesthetist, surgeon or support staff are recognised, but rarely reported formally if minor. However, certain major injuries or death must be reported legally although regulations may vary depending on the country. Injuries may occur because of inadequate precautions or staff inexperience but also due to the unpredictability of equine behaviour, the simple fact of its large body mass, particularly when in a con ned space. Safety of staff is of high priority; induction and recovery represent the greatestrisk periods, when the horse loses or regains consciousness. During maintenance, sudden awareness and arousal leading to movement can injure both staff and horse. Ocular surgery has been associated with increased incidence of movement during anaesthesia (Parviainen and Trim 2000). More than half of the horses undergoing enucleation moved during surgery,whereas only a quarter moved during splint bone excision.Reduced access to the head for anaesthetic depth assessment is a possible explanation; monitoring the end- expiratory inhalant concentration reduced the number of horses that moved by over 50% (Parviainen and Trim 2000). Inhalant concentration differences between the large animal circle and the vaporiser setting (Steffey and Howland 1977), combined with reduced access to the head for assessing the depth of anaesthesia suggest that end-expiratory inhalant concentration monitoring would be bene cial. Induction of anaesthesia Severe adverse events were less commonly reported at induction than during maintenance or recovery of anaesthesia (Johnston et al . 2002). Subluxation of the elbow joint was reported in a pony due to severe abduction of thelimb during induction of anaesthesia using the free fall technique (Senior et al . 2002). Monitoring physiological function is dif cult and unexpected cardiac arrest during induction in healthy horses scheduled for elective surgery is recognised (Johnston et al . 2002; Bidwell et al . Endotracheal intubation Complications associated with intubation are rarely severe,but mild to moderate damage to the oral or nasal mucosa, larynx and trachea can be expected in almost all intubated horses and may go unnoticed (Holland et al . 1986; Heath et al . 1989; Touzot-Jourde et al . 2005). Tissue trauma may occur during insertion, overzealous cuff in flation or when moving the tube without de flating the cuff. Nasotracheal intubation can cause haemorrhage in the ventral or middlemeatus, with the potential for airway obstruction by blood clots as well as aspiration. Minor laryngeal trauma from intubation such as oedema, ecchymosis and haematomas common (Trim et al . 1989; Bradbury et al . 2008). Lesions have been observed even after uneventful intubation(Holland et al . 1986; Heath et al . 1989). In one study including 20 horses, minor laryngeal trauma was not associated withdecreased laryngeal function after anaesthesia (Bradbury et al . 2008). A single case was described where laryngeal paresis developed one day after anaesthesia and did notresolve within the 7 days observation period (Holland et al . 1986). Bilateral laryngeal paralysis is rare without any pre-existing clinical signs (Abrahamsen et al . 1990; Dixon et al . 1993; Bidwell et al . 2007); this may be associated with neck extension and ischaemia of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (Abrahamsen et al . 1990). In one horse, pharyngeal trauma was described after intubation using an uncuffed taperedtube (Cole tube) despite no recognition of dif cult placement or airway obstruction; this ultimately led to ventralneck necrosis and euthanasia (Brock 1985). Tracheal damage is pressure dependent and may occur within 15 min of pressure application when the cuff to tracheal wall pressure exceeds the mucosal perfusion pressure (Nordin 1977). In horses in which cuffs were in flated to prevent leaks (pressure 59 -73 mmHg; 80 -10 cmH 2O), gross lesions were reported in two out of ve horses, but microscopic lesions were found in all horses. At cuff pressuresof 88 mmHg (120 cmH 2O) gross lesions were observed in four out of ve horses, and all horses in this group showed \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd153 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2022histological damage to the mucosa. The gross lesions consisted of hyperaemia and focal haemorrhage and where the cuff compressed the mucosa epithelial attenuation and erosion were detected histologically (Touzot-Jourde et al . 2005). Others have observed mucosal damage at the site ofthe cuff lasting between 24 and 48 h with complete healing only evident after 7 days (Holland et al . 1986; Heath et al . 1989). It could be inferred from these reports that the cuffshould be in flated until no leak is discernible and the cuff pressure checked using a pressure gauge to minimisetracheal epithelial damage. Overin flation of the cuff may cause tracheal mucosal sloughing (Jago et al . 2015) or a tracheal tear (Little 2015). Secondary bacterial infection causing tracheal necrosis(Wylie et al . 2015) and pleuropneumonia (Rainger et al . 2006) may be fatal. Tracheal tears and perforation were assumedto be associated with movement of the tube and extensive extension and flexion of the neck after cuff in flation (Heath . 1989; Rainger et al Saulez et al. 2009). The site of perforation matched the location of the cuff (Saulez et al . 2009). Clinical signs may take up to 2 days to develop (Saulezet al . 2009), presenting as subcutaneous emphysema spreading from the neck to front limbs and thorax, andpneumomediastinum in severe cases (Caron and Townsend 1984). Although lesions often resolve without intervention (Fubini et al . 1985; Saulez et al . 2009), supportive therapy or surgical repair may be indicated. Tracheal necrosis has been described after contact with ethylene oxide used to clean endotracheal tubes (Schatzmann et al . 1981). Cardiovascular complications Cardiovascular collapse represented a quarter to a third ofall fatalities encountered in horses undergoing elective procedures (Johnston et al . 2002; Johnston et al . 2004; Bidwell et al . 2007), while a decade later a retrospective study did not reveal any intraoperative cardiac arrests (Dugdale et al . 2016). In the last 10 years, iso flurane and sevo flurane have replaced halothane for maintenance of anaesthesia. Halothane causes greater myocardial depression compared with iso flurane (Raisis et al catecholamine-induced dysrhythmias (Leesand Tavernor 1970). It is tempting to speculate that a lower incidence of dysrhythmias and better cardiac function may be associated with the increasing use of iso flurane and sevo flurane (Johnston et al . 2004). However, mortality with isoflurane was similar to the mortality experienced with halothane except in horses aged 2 -5 years. It is of note that cardiac arrest was less common with iso flurane in high-risk cases (Johnston et al . 2004). Dysrhythmias associated with cardiac arrest included second-degree atrioventricular block unresponsive to atropine (Bidwell et al . 2007; Marolf et al . 2018), ventricular tachycardia in a horse in recovery (Bidwell et al . 2007) and in a foal leading to ventricular brillation (Coudry et al . 2007). Vasovagal re flex in association with manipulation of the eye or structures near the vagal trunk itself may cause bradycardia or cardiac arrest (Short and Rebhun 1980; Raffe et al . 1986; Parviainen and Taylor and Clarke 2007). Bradycardia followed by asystole attributed to a Cushing-type re flex was described in a foal after cerebrospinal fluid collection (Bennell and Bardell to occur in 5.3% of cases (Parviainen and Trim 2000) but often are self-limiting and therefore seldomly reported. Occasional reports describe, mainly with halothane, ventricular dysrhythmias (Cornick et al accelerated rhythm during dobutamine blood pressure support (Karraschet al . 2013). Post-anaesthetic dysrhythmias within the rst 24 h of abdominal and nonabdominal surgery have been noted and include supraventricular and ventricular premature complexes as well as atrioventricular blockade (Garber et al. 1992; Morgan et al . 2011). In horses undergoing abdominal surgery, intraoperative tachycardia has been identi ed as a risk factor for mortality (Proudman et al . 2006; Adami et al . 2020). Tachycardia may be associated with nociception, hypovolaemia,endotoxaemia or vigorous dobutamine use. Monitoring is dif cult during transport of horses to and from the operating table via hoist when cardiovascular function may be compromised due to redistribution of blood volume. Incidents appear rare but cardiac arrest was reported in a foal (Hopster et al . 2016) and a mare (Conde Ruiz and Junot 2018). The mare was successfully resuscitated(Conde Ruiz and Junot 2018). Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation in horses is challenging, successful attempts are reported in foals and mature horses (Kellagher and Watney 2018; Ruiz 2018). Hypotension is encountered in 42% and 88% of horses undergoing anaesthesia for elective and abdominal surgery,respectively (Parviainen and Trim 2000; Adami et al . 2020). In general, anaesthetic drugs, mechanical ventilation andposition of the horse contribute to hypotension. Dorsal compared with lateral recumbency causes more pronounced hypotension (Blissit et al . 2008). Hypotension contributes to a prolonged recovery (Lindsay et al . 1989; Voulgaris and Hofmeister 2009) as well as other peri- anaesthetic complications, which are discussed below. Hypothermia Hypothermia occurs frequently but may go unnoticed,especially in the mature adult horse if not speci cally monitored, with temperatures of 34 -35\u00b0C, contributing to prolonged recovery (Voulgaris and Hofmeister 2009). Hypercarbia and hypoxaemia Ventilation associated complications are encountered in the majority of cases undergoing general anaesthesia and the reader is referred to recently published extensive reviews (Hubbell and Muir 2015; Auckburally and Nyman 2017; recovery, anaesthesia-induced hypoventilation causes hypoxaemia, which can be improved by increasing the inspired oxygen fraction and supplementing inspiration with a demand valve (Mason et al . 1987). In horses breathing adequately, 15 L/min oxygen supplementation increasedoxygenation (McMurphy and Cribb 1989). Changing lateral recumbency should be avoided as it will worsen hypoxaemia (Mason et al . 1987). Controlled ventilation during general \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd154 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2022anaesthesia resulted in better oxygenation in early recovery but was associated with a period of apnoea (Bardell et al . 2020). Permissive hypercapnia reduced the time tospontaneous ventilation during recovery (Thompson and Bardell 2016) and standing (Brosnan et al . 2012). Hypoxaemia (less than 60 mmHg PaO 2) was identi ed as a risk factor for complications in recovery (R \u20acuegg et al . 2016) although no association with reduced survival was shown in horsesundergoing colic surgery (Trim and Wan 1990). In a single report, hypoxaemia was associated with a prolonged recovery in a draught horse (Dupont et al . 2018). Recovery Mortality and morbidity occur predominantly during recovery (fracture, joint dislocation, upper airway obstruction [UAO]) or become evident at that point (PAM, neuropathy, SCM; Johnston et al . 2016; Laurenza et al . 2020). However, in a retrospective study, the majority of horses (95%) recovered without complication (Dugdale et al . 2016). Fractures in recovery were the second most common cause of mortality reported in CEPEF, accounting for a quarter of the deaths (Johnston et al . 2002) and for one fth of the deaths in a retrospective study (Bidwell et al . 2007). Fractures occurred mainly in older Thoroughbred mares (9 - 18 years old) presented for emergency abdominal surgery(colic, dystocia, caesarean section), but this was also reported in a yearling undergoing osteotomy (Bidwell et al . 2007). Fracture sites included tibia, carpus and radius.Reduced bone density in post-parturient mares (Glade 1993), reduced limb strength after fracture repair and fatigue in severely ill horses may increase the risk of fracture. Fracture of the contralateral limb after fracture repair has been reported once (Dzikiti et al . 2008). Scapulohumeral joint luxation occurred in two horses without obvious cause (Zilbersteinet al . 2005; Hahn et al . 2011) and carpal dislocation in one (Dugdale et al . 2016). Coxofemoral joint luxation is described in one horse previously diagnosed with equine motor neuron disease (Portier and Walsh 2006). Various techniques are employed to recover horses from anaesthesia, and none is without complication. While two retrospective studies showed no difference in complications between unassisted and rope-assisted recoveries in the general horse population (Auer and Huber 2012) and in horses undergoing abdominal surgery (R \u20acuegg et al . 2016), another prospective study claimed fewer attempts to stand and better recovery quality with less injuries with rope-assisted recovery in healthy horses (Arndt et al. 2020). However, 8% of horses did not tolerate ropes (Arndt et al . 2020). Complications with rope-assisted recovery range from 0.5 to 3% (R \u20acuegg et al. 2016; Niimura del Barrio et al . 2020). Technical dif culties and human error have been described in 0.08 -10% of rope-assisted recoveries. These included unexpected release of the head rope, loss of thehead collar, wrapping around legs and tangling of the ropes, tail hair breakage and slipped knots (R \u20acuegg et al . 2016; Niimura al . 2020). Hydro-pool recovery can be used to facilitate recovery in high-risk cases. Complications were reported in one third of these cases, including pulmonary oedema (17%; 10 out of 60 horses), multiple skin abrasions, facial oedema, septic arthritis and incisional infections (Tidwell et al. 2002). The pool-raftrecovery had a complication rate of 7%, but another 13%had subsequent complications once returned to the recovery box (Sullivan et al . 2002). In contrast, the Anderson Sling appeared to enable smooth and successful recoveryalthough one horse would not accept its support (Taylor et al . 2005; Steffey et al . 2009). Tilt-table recovery systems have been reported to fail in six out of 54 cases, eight cases had minor complications including skin abrasions and cast failures, and one horse was subjected to euthanasia due to cast failure (Elmas et al . 2007). Minor complications in recovery such as abrasions, lacerations of the tongue, lip or eye, mild epistaxis, contusions or haematomas are seldom reported and al . 2015; Arndt et al . 2020). Delayed awakening and prolonged duration of lateral recumbency may bepredispose to PAM and respiratory complications. Prolonged recovery is described in a horse with pre-existing vestibular disease due to loss of orientation relation to gravity (Lord et al . 2019). One report describes the unexpected occurrence of focal seizures and permanent central blindness in an adult horse after abdominal surgery without any complications noticed during anaesthesia maintenance (Rovel et al . 2015). is reported 0.9% of cases (Johnston et al . 2002; . 2016; Laurenza et al . 2020). Older studies report a higher incidence of up to 6%, but better understanding of theaetiology, enabling speci c prevention, may have decreased the incidence (Young and Taylor 1993; Duke et al . 2006). Post-anaesthetic myopathy has been associated with decreased muscle perfusion related to hypotension, de ned as mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 65 mmHg (Grandyet al . 1987; Lindsay et al. (Dodman et al . 1988; Richey et al . duration of general anaesthesia (Richey et al . 1990; Johnston et al . 2004), lateral recumbency (Johnston et al . 2004) and larger body mass (Franci et al . 2006). However, myositis may also occur in foals (Manning et al . 1995). Intracompartmental muscle pressure is elevated in the dependent muscle groups in anaesthetised horses, and signi cantly more in hypotensive horses (Lindsay et al . 1989). However, brachial triceps muscle necrosis was reported after an uncomplicated anaesthetic (halothanemaintenance) and MAP ranging above 70 mmHg (Ayala et al . 2009), suggestive of inadequate intracompartmental perfusion. Intraoperative prevention of hypotension may notalways prevent PAM but may reduce its severity (Young and Taylor 1993; Duke et al. 2006). While halothane and iso flurane carry similar risks of peri-anaesthetic complications (Johnstonet al . 2004), the favourable cardiovascular properties of isoflurane and probably also sevo flurane facilitate muscle perfusion. In contrast to halothane, iso flurane leads to better left ventricular systolic function and vasodilation resulting inincreased femoral blood flow (Raisis et al . 2000). Although it prevents local high-pressure points, protective padding alonedoes not prevent PAM in hypotensive horses (Lindsay et al . 1989). However, triceps muscle intracompartmental pressurewas reduced by adequate positioning (pulling dependent \u00a92021 EVJ EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH while supporting the nondependent limb horizontally) and signi cantly decreased further by adding padding (White and Suarez 1986). Post-anaestheticmyopathy usually occurs in muscles of the trunk or legs but smaller muscles such as the masseter may be affected (Clark-Price et al . 2012). Horses undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might incur an increased risk of PAM due to limited space and dif cult positioning (Franci et al . 2006). However, this has not been clearly substantiated: eight out of 350 MRI horsesand two out of 229 undergoing nonabdominal surgery developed PAM in a study too small to detect signi cant differences (Franci et al . 2006). Further, no complications were reported in 77 horses recovering from anaesthesia after MRI (Leece et al . 2008). Clinical signs of PAM are rst seen in the recovery period and include pain or discomfort resulting in box walking and sweating. The affected muscle groups are hard and swollen and the horse may be unable to stand if several muscle groups are affected (Lindsay et al . 1989; Young and Taylor 1993). Isolated raised plaques may develop over bonyprominences at table contact points (Grandy et al . 1987). Delayed onset (30 min) and worsening symptoms may occurafter successful recovery (Trim and Mason 1973). Muscle enzymes increase in horses undergoing general anaesthesia but are signi cantly elevated in horses suffering from hypotensive episodes (Trim and Mason 1973; Grandy et al . 1987; Lindsay et Duke et al . 2006). Creatine kinase increased tenfold compared with normotensive horses 48 h after anaesthesia and aspartate transaminase remained elevated for up to 7 days (Grandy et al . 1987; Lindsay et al . 1989). Treatment includes analgesia and nursing care.Differential diagnosis of post-anaesthetic lameness should include compartment syndrome, which can present similarly (Norman et al . 1989; Louro et al . 2020). Horses undergoing transvenous electrical cardioversion of atrial brillation may have a higher risk of mild PAM (8%; six out of 62 horses). However, no de nite diagnostics were attempted, and recovery scores were good to excellent for the majority of horses (Bellei et al . 2007). In a few single cases, PAM was associated with equine polysaccharide storagemyopathy, primarily but not exclusively in draught horses (Valentine et al . 1997; Bloom et al . 1999; Valentine 2003). Neuropathy Neuropathy and PAM are often not distinguished, so the incidence of neuropathy is unclear, but appears low, reported in <0.1% of anaesthetised horses (Young and Taylor 1993). Underreporting of neuropathy seems likely, especiallywhen mild neurological de cits resolve within a short period of time. A recent retrospective study reported an incidenceof 1.6% (Laurenza et al . 2020). Post-anaesthetic neuropathy of (Dyson et al. 1988; Young and Taylor 1993; Franci et al . 2006), radial (Lindsay et al . 1989; Jago et al . after parturition et al . 2007), peroneal (Moreno et al . 2020) and the facial nerves (Grandy et al Bellei . 2018; Bird et al . 2019) have all been reported. Femoral nerve paralysis has been described in eleven warmblood horses and four ponies undergoing surgery or MRI in lateral recumbency (Dyson et al . 1988; Morenoet al and in one horse positioned in dorsal recumbency (Young and Taylor 1993). Clinical signs may be delayed (Dyson et al . 1988; Young and Taylor 1993; Moreno et al . 2020) and resemble those of PAM but are usually associated with pain unresponsive to various classes of analgesics (Lindsay et al. 1989). While mild or unilateral nerve damage may have a favourable outcome (Dyson et al . 1988; Young and Taylor Franci et al. et al . 2013; Moreno et al . 2020), bilateral femoral nerve paralysis has a guarded prognosis due to the inability of the horse to stand and subsequent challenges of managing a recumbent horse (Dyson et al . 1988; Win eldet al . 2014). The nondependent et al to decreased (Branson et al . 1992; Raisis et al . 2000), but the mechanism is less well understood. Pulling the forelimb caudally may obstructvenous out flow (Taylor and Young 1990). The aetiology of post-anaesthetic neuropathy is not certain, but factors similar to the causes of PAM may play a role. Inadequate padding or direct pressure on the nerve may damage it. However, femoral nerve paralysis has been associated with hyperextension of the pelvic limbs in dorsal (Young and Taylor 1993) and lateral recumbency (Dyson et al . 1998; Franci et al . 2006). Examination of carcasses showed that extension of pelvic limbs stretches the psoasminor tendon and femoral nerve (Dyson et al . 1988). Spinal cord myelopathy Spinal cord myelopathy has been reported in 33 cases since 1979 (Schatzmann et al . and Rocchi 2017; Hughes et al . 2019) and has occasionally been recorded in equine mortality investigations (Johnston et al . 2002; Jago et al . 2015; Dugdale aetiology of SCM remains unknown; reduced perfusion ischaemia of spinal cord in dorsal recumbency (Schatzmann et al . 1979), reduced venous return due to compression of the vena cavaby abdominal contents (Blakemore et al . 1984; Yovich et al. 1986; Wan et al. 1994), vitamin E de ciency destabilising spinal cord membranes (Stolk et al . 1991), ischaemia of the spinal cord, verminous arteritis and embolism (Dugdale and Taylor 2016) have all been suggested. Most cases of SCM are young male horses ( <2 years old) undergoing anaesthesia of less than 1.5 h duration. However, SCM also has been described in mares (Schatzmann et al . 1979; heavier breeds were associated with SCM, but cases arealso reported after lateral recumbency (Raidal et al . 1997; et al . 1986; Wan et al . 1994; Lam et al . 1995) and in a pony (Hughes et al . 2019). Various anaesthetic protocols were used, including halothane, iso flurane and sevofl urane as well as TIVA (Raidal et al . 1997). Arterial blood pressure was reported only occasionally but when stated was within an acceptable range in the majority (Wan et al. 1994; van Loon et al . 2010; Ragle et al. 2011). In recovery, horses struggle to stand up or are able to stand but develop progressive \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd156 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2022paraparesis or paraplegia of the hindlimbs. With time clinical signs progress, potentially including forelimbs, requiring euthanasia in all cases. Histopathological ndings depended on the duration and severity of clinical signs. Venouscongestion, oedema and haemorrhage into the grey matter have been reported affecting thoracic and lumbosacral spinal cord segments (Schatzmann 2019). . Malignant hyperthermia Malignant hyperthermia (MH) has been described in Quarter Horses, Thoroughbreds, Appaloosa, Arabs and ponies undergoing general et al . 2005; Aleman et al . 2009). It is associated with a mutation in the ryanodine receptor gene (RyR1) causing increased myoplasmic calcium (Aleman et al . 2004). Clinical signs include hypercapnia, respiratory acidosis, hyperthermia,tachycardia, hypertension, electrolyte derangements and sometimes muscle rigidity due a hypermetabolic (Waldron-Mease et al . et al. 1989; Aleman al . 2005; Aleman et al . 2009). Halothane or isoflurane was used for maintenance in all equine cases of MH; however, other inhalant agents and succinylcholine have been linked to its development in other species (Rosenberg et al. 2015). Halothane maintenance in combination with succinylcholine triggered MH (Hildebrandand Howitt 1983; Manley et al . 1983). Most horses were treated symptomatically and recovered from anaesthesiawith a few exceptions; one horse died from cardiac arrest in recovery and three were subjected to euthanasia due to complications in recovery (Manley et al . 1983; Aleman et al . 2005, 2009). Post-anaesthetic myopathy may be encounteredafter recovery (Manley et al . 1983; Klein et al . 1989). Hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis Hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease in Quarter Horses descended from the stallion Impressive . The mutation causes failure of sodium channel inactivation after depolarisation resulting in areduced resting membrane potential, increased ef flux of potassium and subsequently hyperkalaemia (Meyer et al . 1999). A few horses have developed HPP episodes during anaesthesia (Cox 1985; Robertson et al . . et al . 1995; Bailey 1996; Carpenter and Evans 2005; Baetge 2007; Pang et al. 2011) and successful management is reported (Cornicket al . 1994; Moody et al . 1995; Evans 2005; Baetge 2007; Pang et al . 2011). Episodes of HPP are triggered by stress, anaesthesia, diets high in potassium, transport and concurrent disease. During anaesthesia, HPP causes hypercapnia, muscle fasciculations and hyperkalaemia leading to bradycardia-associated changes in the electrocardiogram (Robertson et al. 1992; Traub-Dargatz et al . 1992; Cornick et al . Bailey Baetge 2007; Pang et al . 2011). Occasionally,paradoxical tachycardia is reported (Cornick et al . 1994; Bailey et al . 1996; Pang et al . 2011). Horses may undergo one uneventful general anaesthetic, but stress-related incidents may cause an episode during a second (Cornick et al. 1994; Pang et al. 2011). Hypercarbia and hyperkalaemia should be treated immediately. Genetic testing of Quarter Horses and related breeds descending from Impressive are recommended. Regurgitation and aspiration Regurgitation has been reported only once, in a horse undergoing orthopaedic surgery without any subsequentsequelae (Carpenter and Hall 1981). However, it is encountered in approximately one in ten horses presented with colic (Bennell and Senior 2019). In horses undergoing abdominal surgery, nasogastric re flux was not associated with increased mortality (Proudman et al. 2006), but aspiration of gastric contents may have severeconsequences, although only three cases have been reported (Anderson et al . 2017; Monticelli and Adami 2019). Two horses presented with gastric impaction, abdominaldistension and had a nasogastric tube in place during induction and maintenance. It was hypothesised that aspiration occurred during induction (Monticelli and Adami 2019). Gastric contents were seen in the orotracheal tube once mechanical ventilation was started. Reverse Trendelenburg position, suctioning the airway, ventilation strategies and salbutamol to treat hypoxaemia were applied successfully in one horse (Monticelli and Adami 2019). The anatomy of the equine cardiac sphincter makes regurgitation or re flux rare (Budras and Henschel 2008) but pathological changes or placement of a nasogastric tubemight change this. Intubation and securing the airway in sternal may be considered for prevention (Monticelli and Adami 2019). The third reported case experienced nasogastric re flux during recovery after undergoing sham ventral coeliotomy for a research project, with minimal manipulation. Treatment was withheld due to the experimental procedure, resulting in pneumonia, systemic in flammatory response syndrome and euthanasia within 18 h (Anderson et al . 2017). Nasogastric sphincter incompetence was the speculated cause. Other complications associated with nasogastric tube placement include UAO during recovery in a horse with laryngeal hemiparesis when the nasogastric tube was left inplace al . 2011), sinusitis in three horses (Nieto et al . 2014) and usually mild and self-limiting epistaxis. However, severe nasal haemorrhage in a horse caused the loss of 24 litres of blood, requiring blood transfusion (Trim et al . 1997). Cerebral necrosis Post-anaesthetic cerebral necrosis, con rmed by histopathology, has been described in six horses(Spadavecchia et al . 2001; McKay et al. 2002). Neurological signs developed either during recovery, including galloping,nystagmus and myoclonic movement of the tongue (Spadavecchia et al . 2001) or up to 7 days later, including bilateral blindness, propulsive pacing, head pressing, lethargyand generalised seizures (McKay et al . 2002). All horses were adult, anaesthetised with halothane or iso flurane and \u00a92021 / AE MARCH abdominal or orthopaedic surgery. Periods of hypercapnia and hypoxaemia occurred, which could have influenced cerebral autoregulation, but the cause of the cerebral necrosis remains unknown. Pulmonary oedema and upper airway obstruction Reports of pulmonary oedema are accumulating (Jones et al. 1988; Abrahamsen et al . 1990; Dixon . 1993; Merlin et al . 2019). Respiratory complications are described in CEPEF as fatal in 12 out of 35,978 horses; some 4% of the fatalities,and presumably included pulmonary oedema, but not exclusively. Dugdale et al . (2016) reported four cases of respiratory obstruction in 1268 cases; two of these died withpulmonary oedema. Pulmonary oedema develops for a number of reasons, including UAO (Abrahamsen al . et microembolism (Jones et al . 1988), drug-associated capillary leakage (Shaw et al . air (Holbrook et al . 2007; Pellegrini-Masini et al . 2009) and mechanical causes (Tidwell et al. 2002). Re-expansion injury and anaphylaxis, which permeability (Balland Trim 1996; Kaartinen et al . 2010), have been considered likely to contribute. 'Negative pressure pulmonary oedema 'develops almost instantly after one or two attempts to inspire against theincreased resistance of an obstructed airway due to the large negative pressures generated (Senior 2005). Immediate establishment of an airway followed by symptomatic treatment is crucial: drug administration have all been described (Senior 2005). Clinical signs of pulmonaryoedema include respiratory distress and (blood stained) foam from the lungs pouring out of the nostrils and mouth. Deterioration with hypoxaemia, collapse and cardiac arrest may be rapid. Upper airway obstruction may be proximal or distal to the larynx or associated with the larynx itself. Congestion andoedema of the nasal passages from increased hydrostatic pressure when the head is positioned below the level of the heart may hinder air flow (Ball and Trim 1996; Borer 2005). Avoiding UAO has been attempted by instillation ofphenylephrine into the ventral meatus at the end of anaesthesia to reduce congestion and obstruction without major side effects (Lukasik et al. 1997). Alternatively, an orotracheal tube left in situ or a nasal tube placed forrecovery may bridge the gap until the nasal passages return to normal function (Thomas et al . 1987). However, obstruction from a kinked tube may occur (Kaartinen et al . 2010). Deflating the cuff may ensure some air flow around the tube. Orotracheal tubes left in situ may be bitten off or break. Onereport described successful removal of a nasotracheal tube the next day using endoscopy (Potter et al . 2015). Upper airway obstruction due to bilateral laryngeal paralysis after extubation in horses without pre-existing signs(Abrahamsen et al . 1990; Dixon et al . 1993; Bidwell et al . 2007) were associated with nerve damage due to neck extension, laryngeal nerve ischaemia (Abrahamsen et al . 1990), tissue oedema due to surgical manipulation, laryngealoedema and spasm or functional airway collapse (Dixon et al . 1993; Tute et al . 1996; Merlin et al Pre-existing left laryngeal hemiplegia, large body mass, prolongedanaesthesia, hyperextension of the neck, hypotension, hypoventilation and hypoxaemia were named as risk factors for UAO (Southwood et al . 2003). Airway surgery may be a predisposing factor but only one case report described UAOafter ventriculocordectomy (Tute et al . 1996). In horses with unilateral laryngeal paralysis, dorsal displacement of the softpalate (Kollias-Baker et al . 1993) and a nasogastric tube left in situ for recovery (Veres-Ny /C19ekiet al . 2011) caused UAO. One case report described fatal pulmonary haemorrhage in a horse with pre-existing exercise-induced pulmonaryhaemorrhage, after partial UAO in recovery and speculates that beside UAO, catecholamine pulmonary vasoconstriction, the use of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists or blunt trauma may have played a role (Boustead et al . 2020). Pulmonary oedema may be drug associated and is reported after the use of carfentanil and xylazine in horses (Shaw et al . 1995). The proposed mechanism may be similar to pulmonary oedema caused by alpha-2 adrenergicagonists in sheep where alpha-2 adrenergic agonist-induced bronchoconstriction and pulmonary vasospasm probably result from direct stimulation of peripheral alpha-2adrenoceptors (K \u20acastner 2006). Mechanical causes of increased airway pressure, such as the extrathoracic hydrostatic effects of immersion in a recovery pool, plus associated cardiopulmonary changes, have been described leading to pulmonary oedema (Richter et al . 2001; Tidwell et al . 2002). Ten out of 60 horses developed pulmonary oedema of which three ended fatally(Tidwell et al . 2002). Unsuitable or misused equipment may also lead to pulmonary oedema: demand valves that requirehigh inspiratory pressures may increase airway pressure and the risk of pulmonary oedema (Watney et al . 1985; Johnson et al . 1994). Post-anaesthetic colic Post-anaesthetic colic (PAC) is the most commonly described peri-anaesthetic complication (Proudman et al . 2002; Senior et 2007; Jago et al . 2015). In nonabdominal surgery, the incidence of PAC ranges from around one in 33 to one in tenhorses (Senior et al . 2004; Andersen et al . Jago et al . 2015; Bailey et al . 2016). Different study designs and the de nition of colic may contribute to the variation. The risk of PAC was much higher, one in two toseven, in horses undergoing abdominal surgery (Proudman et al . 2002; Mair and Smith 2005b; Brown et al . 2015). Clinical signs developed between 4 h and 5 days after abdominal surgery (French et al . 2002; Senior et al . 2004; Nelson et al. 2013; Jago et al. 2015). Most commonly, PAC developed within the rst day (Jago et al . 2015) or 12 -72 h after surgery (Senior et al . 2004). A speci c diagnosis was often not made, but large intestinal impaction, including caecal impaction, has been implicated (Senior et al . 2004, 2006; Jago et al . 2015). In most cases, medical treatment was sufcient to abolish PAC (Senior et al . 2004, 2006; Andersen et al . 2006; Nelson et al . EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2022PAC lasted from one (Senior et al . 2006) to two days (Jago et al . 2015). Horses undergoing orthopaedic surgery are at an increased risk of developing PAC compared with horses undergoing nonorthopaedic surgery (Senior et al . 2006) or MRI (Andersen et al. 2006). PAC developed in only 1.5% of horses undergoing MRI compared with 7.1% of horses undergoing orthopaedic surgery (Andersen et al . 2006). Morphine appeared to increase the risk of PAC fourfold in horses undergoing elective, nonabdominal procedures (Senior et al . 2004). Butorphanol decreased the incidence (Jago et al . 2015). However, morphine was not associated with PAC in other studies (Mircica et al. 2003; Andersen et al. 2006) and may be a confounding factor when the type ofsurgery is taken into account. Other factors associated with an increased incidence of PAC were sodium benzylpenicillin or ceftiofur administration (Andersen et al . 2006; Jago et al . 2015), out of hours surgery (Senior et al . 2004) and Thoroughbred breeds (Jago et al . 2015). Longer duration of general anaesthesia decreased the risk (Andersen et al . 2006). In horses undergoing abdominal surgery, PAC was associated with jugular thrombosis possibly related to endotoxaemia, a high-packed cell volume (PCV) on presentation, colon torsion and re-coeliotomy (French et al . 2002). The above factors have been shown to play a role in the development of PAC; however, the aetiology of colic is multifactorial; changes in management including diet and housing, behaviour, age and parasite infection have been identi ed as risk factors for development of colic in non- hospitalised horses (Curtis et al . 2019). In the hospitalised horse, pain, starvation and anaesthetic drugs are likely also to contribute to PAC. Post-anaesthetic ileus Post-anaesthetic ileus (POI) is a speci c cause of PAC and is described in 6 -40% of horses after abdominal surgery with varying mortality from 14 up to 66% (Mee et al . 1998b; Freeman et al Morton and Proudman et al. et al. Smith 2005a,b; Holcombe al . 2009; et al . 2009, 2015; Jacobs et al . 2019). The diagnosis is based on small intestinal dysmotilityand/or distension with re flux of large volumes of intestinal content, tachycardia, abdominal discomfort, reduced faecal output or absent borborygmy (Lefebvre et al . 2016). Re- laparotomy may be required in 8 -19% of cases (Parker et al . 1989; Proudman et al . al . et al . 2015; Findley et al . 2017). While the incidence of functional ileus and obstruction appears similar (Mair and Smith 2005c), successful outcome after re- laparotomy varies between 24 and 81% (Parker et al . 1989; Mair and Smith et al . 2017). The incidence of POI may be as high as 62% following re-laparotomy (Mair and Smith 2005c). Risk factors for POI include duration of anaesthesia and surgery (Roussel et al . 2001; Cohen et al . 2004) and type of surgery (Roussel et al . 2001). The risk of developing POI increased twofold with each hour of surgery. Small intestinalsurgery (Roussel et al . 2001; Cohen et al Torfs et al . 2009), resection or anastomosis of the intestine (Roussel et al . 2001), length of resection (Holcombe et al . 2009) andpedunculated lipoma removal (French et al . 2002) were associated with an increased risk of developing POI. Other related factors were increased PCV at induction (Blikslager et al . 1994; . Cohen et al . 2004; Holcombe et al . 2009), increased total protein (Roussel et al . 2001; Cohen et al . 2004), Arabian breed (Roussel et al . 2001; Nelson et al . 2013) and increasing age (Holcombe et al . 2009; Brown et al . 2015). POI was also associated with developing wound discharge, diarrhoea andlaminitis (Cohen et al . 2004), longer duration of hospitalisation and death or euthanasia (Roussel et al . 2001). A recent review article considers this in detail (Lisowski et al . 2018). Complications with arterial and venous cannulation Arterial cannulation for direct arterial blood pressure monitoring and arterial blood gas analysis is essential for monitoring anaesthetised horses. Associated risks in humans include haemorrhage, thrombosis, sepsis, temporary occlusion, permanent ischaemic damage, haematoma formation and infection (Scheer et al . 2002). Destruction of the proximal sesamoid bones has been described in threehorses after metatarsal artery cannulation resulting in lameness and subsequent euthanasia in two of these cases (Barr et al . 2005). Venous thrombophlebitis occurs in about one in a hundred horses undergoing nonabdominal procedures (Senior et al . 2007) but nearer one in 13 undergoing coeliotomy (Proudman et al . 2002; Mair and Smith increases the risk of developing thrombophlebitis 20-fold, hypoproteinaemia and intestinal disease four- to vefold (Dolente et al . 2005). Other associated factors are increased PCV in horses with colic(French et al . 2002), long duration of cannulation (Lankveld et al . 2001), increased temperature (Traub-Dargatz 1994). Transient Horner 's syndrome after routine jugular venipuncture was reported in two horses (Sweeny andSweeny 1984). Extravascular thiopentone causes the skin to slough (Jones 1968); con rmation of correct placement of the venous cannula should be vigilantly con rmed prior to using thiopentone. Inadvertent placement of the venous cannula into the carotid artery is a potential hazard, which should berecognised to avoid inadvertent intracarotid injection. Blood clots can occlude the catheter (Gulick and Meagher 1981) and should not be flushed into the systemic circulation. Exsanguination and air embolism are potential risks if a cannula cap is dislodged or if the cannula inadvertently disconnects from a fluid line, depending on the direction of the venous cannula placement and position of the horse(Caporelli et al . 2009; Parkinson et al . 2018; et Normal coagulation from avenous cannula. Clinical signs of venous air embolism range from decreased end-expiratory carbon dioxide, tachycardia and hypotension during general anaesthesia to mild pruritus, agitation and neurological signs including vestibular signs and central blindness to pulmonary oedema and cardiovascular collapse in the awake horse (Bradbury et al . 2005; 2018; Makra et al . 2019). In 75% of cases in a small retrospective study, resolution of clinical signs occurred within 6 h (Parkinson et al . 2018). Accidental breaking, cutting of the cannula or loss of a guidewire may result in a foreign body in the vascular system, which can lodge in the heart, pulmonary artery or lungs. Penetration of the right ventricle from a cannula tip was reported in a foal (Lees et al . 1989). Remnants have been successfully removed from foals and adult horses (Lees et al . 1989; Ames al . 2013). Removing the cannula embolus in adult horses is more dif cult; appropriately long equipment is needed, and imaging theforeign body clearly is dif cult even if a radiopaque cannula is used (Scarratt et al. 1997; Nannarone et al . 2013). Complications with myelography Cervical myelography can cause multiple adverse effectsrelated to idiosyncratic reactions to the contrast agent and alterations in craniospinal volume or pressure. Adverse reactions occurred in a third of horses undergoing cervical myelography with iohexol, including hypotension during general anaesthesia, reduced mentation (Mullen et al . 2015). Longer anaesthesia and higher volume of contrast increase thelikelihood of adverse reactions (Mullen et al . 2015). Manipulation of the head and neck during myelography mayresult in tracheal lesions causing (pleuro)pneumonia (Rainger et al. 2006; Mullen et al. 2015). Worsening of the neurological signs can be expected in 25% of horses (Hubbell et al . 1988; Mullen et al . 2015). Adverse drug reactions Adverse drug reactions are well recognised in human medicine and can be classi ed as augmented (dose- dependent and predictable) or bizarre (dose-independentand unpredictable; Patton and Borshoff 2018). Either the active compound, the preservative or additives may contribute to the reaction and affect organ systems or receptors directly, cause allergic or anaphylactoid reactions or lead to acute toxicity. Examples of 'augmented 'adverse drug reactions in equine anaesthesia include haemodynamic effects of drug administration but may also focus on decreased gastrointestinal motility after administration of opioids (Boscan 2009; Mama et al . 2009) or anticholinergic drugs (Roberts and Argenzio 1986). In the horse, anecdotal 'bizarre 'reactions to various drugs are recognised in practice but the literature is sparse. Sodium penicillin administration causes a transient (10 min) decrease in arterial blood pressure by 8 -15 mmHg in anaesthetised horses but the cause remains undetermined (Hubbell et al . 1987). Dysrhythmias and hypotension, followed by cardiac arrest in few cases, have been reported after intravenous administration of trimethoprim/sulphonamide in horses when combined with detomidine (Dick and White 1987; Taylor et al . 1988; Parson 1989). Seizure-like activity has been reported in a foal after gadolinium administration for magnetic resonance imagingand after treatment the foal recovered uneventfully (Arganoet al . 2018). Pruritus after extradural administration of morphine in horses was described (Haitjema and Gibson 2001; Burford and Corley 2006) and while histamine release is speculated to be causative, the molecular mechanism has not yet been determined. Priapism that required medical management was reported in a gelding after premedication with acepromazine (Taylor and Bolt 2011). However, the prevalence of penis prolapse after acepromazine administration was encountered in less than one in 10,000 cases and described to be transient with less than 1 -6ho f duration and not requiring intervention in majority of cases(Driessen et al . 2011). Human error and equipment failure There is, as yet, little documentation on the effects of human error in equine anaesthesia. This includes, for example, inadvertent arterial injection of a drug, injection of the wrong drug, dosing errors and failure to check equipment. Human error contributes to 51 -77% of human anaesthesia related mortality and has been associated with lack of experience or competence in the vast majority and errors of judgment in a few cases (Lienhart et al . 2006). Teamwork and communication were identi ed as contributing factors (Lienhart et al. 2006; Haller et al . 2011). The risk of mortality was reduced if a senior anaesthetist was available (Arbouset al . 2005). In human medicine, it is recognised that 'the presence of an appropriately trained and experiencedanaesthetist is important for the safety during anaesthesia ' (Checketts et al . 2016). Anaesthetist competence includes not only practical skills and theoretical knowledge but also non-technical skills, understanding of work and intuitive expert knowing (Larsson 2017). It seems likely that anaesthetist skill and experience has a similar effect in equine anaesthesia, and it is to be hoped that the fourth Con dential Enquiry into Perioperative Equine Fatalities (CEPEF-4; Gozalo-Marcilla et al . 2020) will elucidate this. Few reports acknowledge human error in equine anaesthesia. Detomidine overdose resulted in prolonged recovery; this was successfully recti ed with an antagonist once the cause had been recognised (Di Concetto et al . 2007). Accidental overdose of lidocaine in a foal caused cardiac arrest but treatment with intralipid andcardiopulmonary resuscitation was successful (Vieitez et al . 2017). Accidental administration of unfractioned heparinresulted in cancellation of surgery and prolonged clotting times (Pekkola et al . 2018). Inadvertent mixing of drugs, for example thiopentone and ketamine, which are both used todeepen anaesthesia, may lead to undesirable adverse effects as they form a glue-like plaque when combined. Interventions associated with surgery may in fluence physiological function. Hypertension and tachycardia have been reported after application of a tourniquet; these resolved after tourniquet removal (Abrahamsen et al . 1989). Failure to check or identify malfunctioning anaesthetic equipment prior to use may lead to complications: malfunction of the oxygen concentrator and the auxiliary oxygen supply causing hypoxaemia (Kropf and Hughes 2018); malfunction of the inspiratory valve resulting in hypercapnia (Baxter et al . 1991) or inability to mechanically ventilate the \u00a92021 EVJ EQUINE VETERINARY (Pleyers et al . 2020); ventilator bellows leaking into the breathing system causing increased airway pressure and decreasing depth of anaesthesia (Klein and Wilson 1989); rebreathing due to an incompetent expiratory valve leading to severe hypercapnia (Thompson 2014); positive-end- expiratory pressure and increased airway pressure caused by slipping of leucoplast tape that was applied to prevent a leak between endotracheal tube and connector (Gregson and Clutton 2012) or by a dysfunctional expiratory flow regulator (Cruz-Benedetti et al . 2017); unrecognised wear the endotracheal tube cuff leading to overin flation, herniation of the cuff and airway obstruction (Richardson andMcMillan 2017); underestimation of arterial blood pressure due to a broken pressure transducer interface (Le Chevallier and Van Oostrom 2020). Failure of the equipment or to secure it adequately and interference by the person operating the ropes have resulted in complications during rope-assisted recovery (R \u20acuegg et al . 2016; Bird et al . 2019; Arndt et al . 2020). Demand valves must be used carefully to avoid increased dangerously high airway pressure. If oxygen issupplied via a nasal, nasotracheal or orotracheal tube, it must not impede expiration or baro- or volutrauma may occur, especially in smaller horses. Ocular damage Corneal erosions or ulcers can develop during general anaesthesia due to reduced tear production, abrasion or scratching during positioning (Hubbell et al . 1988; Jago et al . 2015). Clinically asymptomatic corneal erosions have been reported in almost 20% of anaesthetised horses despite routine use of eye lubrication and were associated with duration of anaesthesia and lateral recumbency (Scarabelli et al. 2018). Cautious preparation for surgery or arterial cannulisation to avoid contamination of theeye with cleaning fluids and tissue glue, as well as careful identi cation of eye lubricant to prevent inadvertent use of the wrong, possibly irritant materials are recommended. Conclusion Equine anaesthesia harbours a variety of risks for the patient, the anaesthetist and the other staff involved. Causes and risk factors for peri-anaesthetic mortality have been identi ed and continue to be the focus of current research althoughmost still depends on retrospective evaluations. The unchanged mortality rate over the last decades is disappointing and invites further large prospective research studies. Hopefully CEPEF-4 (Gozalo-Marcilla et al . 2020) will provide some answers for both mortality and morbidity. This narrative review summarises the current literature, including case reports, with the aim of providing a completeoverview of equine peri-anaesthetic mortality and morbidity and raising awareness of the large variety of complications.
