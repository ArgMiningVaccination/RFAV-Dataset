SUBJECT MATTER: Conceptual IssuesTEACHING RELIGION & HEALING More typically taught as: an anthropological subject a history class a religious studies topic a CAM modality At Baylor, I teach this as a medical humanities seminar to pre -health students. I draw on all of the above contexts. HOW MY COURSE DIFFERS A medical humanities elective. Upper -level undergraduate pre -health students. Material from across professions, academic disciplines & fields, and medical specialties: Incl. psychiatry, nursing, anthropology, sociology, psychology, history, religion, theology, pastoral care, biomedical sciences, integrative medicine, and more. Introduces students to the multifaceted & longstanding conversation between faith & the practice of healing that dates to antiquity.COURSE DESCRIPTION From the syllabus: \"This course provides an introduction to the subject of religious healing, including recent research. Nonmedical healing and the work of its practitioners are referred to by various names \u2014 religious healing, spiritual healing, faith healing, mental healing, energy healing \u2014each implying something distinctive. Moreover, there is considerable variation within each category, as healers do not describe themselves uniformly. To add to the complexity, religious healers are found throughout the world, across cultures and faith traditions, and have existed alongside conventional medical care for thousands of years. \"COURSE OBJECTIVES After completing Religious Healing (MH 4V98) , students will be able to: (a)Describe the history and scope of the work of religious healers; (b)Identify theories that religious healers and scholars use to explain healing; (c)Share personal insights into the experience of healing; (d)Summarize contemporary perspectives on healing across religions and cultures; and, (e)Discuss important research findings from studies of religious healing.CONTENT DECISIONS Timeline: Starting point, roughly, is the healing ministry of Christ. Religious traditions: Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, indigenous African religions, Brazilian Spiritism, New Thought, the paranormal, contemporary New Age religion What got left out: Pre - Christian antiquity (e.g., Rome, Greece, ANE, China, Indian subcontinent, OT era, pre - history). Material I covered in Religion and Medicine (OUP, 2020).2.

FEEDBACK: Ideas for the FutureSTUDENT FEEDBACK Very positive student evaluations: mostly 5's, with some 4's on particular aspects. Comments include that this has been a favorite class or that I'm a favorite professor. Students regularly ask me for medical or graduate school recommendation letters. Students have asked me to be their Honors thesis advisor. Post - graduation anecdotes from alumni currently in medical school that this was their favorite class at Baylor. IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE New topics: e.g., more medieval, pre -Christian, & Eastern content New assignments: e.g., \"Pilgrimages of Europe\" video series Guest speakers/practitioners: incl. healing demonstrations; may be an issue for Baylor Publication: e.g., in a medical education journal, to encourage this content being taught elsewhere A second course: e.g., on energy/spiritual healing modalities (incl. energy - based bodywork) A limiting factor is "}
