Sharing a photo of pouches with Covid-19 IgM/IgG written on them, WhatsApp users are sharing a message that reads, \"Good News for world Great news! Coronavirus vaccine ready. Able to cure patient. Hats off to US scientist. right now Trump announced that Roche medical company will launch the vaccine next Sunday and millions of doses are ready from it!!!! (sic)\" Times Fact Check received the message from a number of readers on its WhatsApp number. These readers wanted to know if the message was authentic.TRUTH Covid-19 IgM/IgG is a testing kit and not a vaccine. The kit has nothing to do with Roche Diagnostics. It is manufactured by [Sugentech](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sugentech) . There is no vaccine for coronavirus yet.VERIFICATION AND METHODOLOGY Using 'Covid-19 IgM/IgG' as keyword, we found a news [report](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/18/new-rapid-covid-19-testing-kit-can-return-results-in-15-minutes-but-not-yet-available-in-australia) dated March 17, 2020, from The Guardian about this Covid-19 testing kit. Observing the photo shared closely, we found that it carried the logo of a South Korean brand called 'Sugentech'. Looking into the products section of Sugentech on its official website, we found that it had a product [listed](http://sugentech.com/products/products-view.php?ct=7&target=32) by the name of Covid-19 IgM/IgG. Sugentech described the kit as a kit for the qualitative test of COVID-19 antibody by immunochromatography. \"SGTi-flex COVID-19 IgM/IgG is a gold nanoparticle-based immunochromatographic test kit for qualitative determination of COVID-19's IgM and IgG antibodies in human whole blood (finger prick or venous), serum or plasma,\" said the description of the product. \"As there is no medicine or vaccine, the best way to combat this infection is isolation,\" the page clearly stated. Last week, life-science giant Roche [launched](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/roche-launches-clinical-trial-covid-19-pneumonia-hopeful-actemra-after-backing-from-china) a clinical trial of Covid-19 pneumonia hopeful Actemra after the drug received backing from China. There is no FDA-approved drug, vaccine or therapeutics to treat Covid-19 yet.VERDICT Times Fact Check has found that a photo of Covid-19 test kit is being circulated on WhatsApp with a fake claim that US scientists and life-science company Roche has found a vaccine "}
