Access to health care can be one of the most daunting parts of moving to a new duty station. Even when the quality of care available is high, navigating the health system, dealing with insurance and working out which practitioners to see can all be quite overwhelming . This Handbook aims to simplify some of that, and give s you the information you n eed to make informed choices. I encourage you to read it prior to taking up your post, so that you are equipped to make decisions about health care for you and your family. The UN invests heavily in supporting the health and wellbeing of its staff through our health insurance products , and the Medical Services Division. We want you to feel confident and at ease as you learn to use the US health care system . You are going to have a very busy first few weeks as you settle into your new duty station. Don't forget, during this time, to make some space to start taking control of your health care . I recommend you attend to three key tasks : 1. If your new role is going to involve trave l, make an appointment at the Medical Service s Division to have your travel health needs met (especially vaccinations), well in advance of your first planned travel. 2. Make a routine appointment with a Primary Care Practitioner (this Handbook includes info rmation on how to choose one) within the first couple of months, so that you can start familiarising yourself with the health care system here, without the pressure of a medical emergency. 3. Identify your nearest emergency departments , and in that first dis cussion with your Primary Care Practitioner, develop a plan about who you would call, and where you would go to, in the event of an injury or sudden illness. If you do become unwell or suffer an injury, I know that the information provided here will help you to navigate the health care system with ease. I wish you health and success in New York. Martha Helena Lopez Assistant Secretary -General Office for Human Resources Management Introduction NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 5 The health care system in the United States (US) can be confusing with its insurance plans, payment systems, coverage options and forms of medical practice . This Handb ook aims to give you a general overview of the system, and help you navigate the often -convoluted pathways to obtaining health care in the U S. What you receive in health care benefits in the US is determined by the insurance package that you sign up for. Health insurance in the US resides primarily in the private sector, where employee groups negotiat e with private health insurance companies to manage a package of health care benefits for their employees. In any large employee gr oup there might be one, two or three health care packages offered, each with different benefits and, to some extent, different costs for the employee. The United Nations (UN) provides its own insurance package and contracts to process in- and out -of-network insurance claims in the U S with three different insurance companies : Aetna and Empi re Blue Cross (EBC) for medical, and Cigna for dental. This booklet primarily refer to protocols and benefits associated with the two medical insurance packages , Aetna and Empire Blue Cross (EBC), offered to UN employees . The major concepts outlined here are applicable to the dental insurance plan as well . It is important to note that the UN insurance plans are self -insured plans. This means th at the risk of providing insurance rests with the UN and the covered members under the plan, not with the insurance carriers. Premiums are set based on the projected claims experience of all active and retired staff members covered under the plans, and do not take into account the claims experience of non -UN populations. Premiums collected are held by the UN , and the insurance carriers are reimbursed only for the claims that they actually pay out to providers and plan members , in addition to a fixed monthly administrative fee per subscriber (i.e., an active or retired staff member , regardless of the number of family members covered). While health insurance provides assistance to staff in covering a variety of medical costs, it does not cover all medic al-related services , nor at full costs. All staff members and their covered family members should familiarize themselves with the rules and benefits of their selected health insurance plan s, which are contained in the latest information circular and plan descriptions available on the UN Health and Life Insurance Section's website ( un.org/insurance ). Terminology Co-Pay is a fixed fee established by the insurance companies in adva nce, which you make each time you use a service. It is paid at the time of each visit or may sometimes be billed to you at a later date. It is customary that the co - pay for a visit to a primary care physician to be lower than that for a specialist. The amo unt is often listed on your insurance card . NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 6 Deductible refers to medical expenses that you will be asked to pay before your insurance covers to pay for a service. For example , some plans require consumers to pay for anywhere from $20 to $1,000 worth o f services before the insurance coverage will start paying any benefits. Factors to Consider: Deductibles are mostly applied to out -of-network services. A deductible can also be applicable for certain kinds of services, such as hospitalizations and menta l health services . It is important to know what payments count toward your deductible. It is best to keep a file of receipts for the out -of-pocket expenses incur red, as well as statements showing what your insurance company has paid. This will help you t o keep track of expenses and allow you to more easily keep track of where you and your family are in paying your deductible. Even if you do not expect to receive a reimbursement, it is still important to file a claim with your insurance company in order f or these expenses to be tracked and credited towards your deductible. In-Network refers to d octors, hospitals, clinics, laboratories , pharmacies and other health care providers that i nsurance companies have negotiate d with to provide health care service s at an agreed upon rate of payment. For example , a routine visit might be negotiated at $50/visit, which means the doctor agrees to accept this rate of payment, with the patient pa ying his/her co-pay and the insura nce plan covering the balance. Factors to Consider: With the exception of co -pays, the insurance plan pays for the services . You should not incur additional out -of-pocket expenses for covered services or prescription drugs that are provided in-network . Out-of-Network refer s to medical service providers who are covered by your plan but are not signed on as in -network. How it works: Your insurance company agrees to pay 80% of what they have determined to be the \"usual and customary\" fee for the service . You will pay out-of-pocket for the remaining portion. Factors to Consider: Whilst going out -of-network may mean that you have a wider range of providers to choose from, the downside is that you can incur much higher (and sometimes, very significant) out -of-pocket costs. The out-of-network provider often charges a much higher fee than an in-network provider. Out-of-network expenses can be considerable if the services are for surgery, hospitalization, and other costly procedures. It is perfectly acceptable to ask for the standa rd charges f or a visit, a medical procedure or a diagnostic procedure in advance when you are NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 7 going out -of-network . It is strongly advised that you find out which costs you will be responsible for in advance i.e., the facility costs, ana esthesiology, medic ations, etc. An additional drawback of out -of-network services is that you need to assume much more responsibilit ies for the administration of your medical care. Referrals, billing, prior approvals and cost management for out -of- network services requ ire attention and input from the patient. Given the high cost of health care in the US, it is important for individuals to understand that they put themselves at financial risk when utilizing out -of- network providers since the insurance plans' reimbursem ents are based on maximum allowable amounts and not the actual amounts charged by providers. Out of network providers drive up the costs of insurance premiums Out-of-Pocket Cost s is a generic term for any medical expenses that you, the consumer, are re quired to pay on your own. These are expenses above and beyond what your insurance plan will pay for . Prior Authorization is an attempt to rationalize and contain the high cost of medical care in the US. There are a numb er of medical procedures, medications, diagnostic tests and specialty consultations and hospitalizations that require authorization from the insurance company before the insurer will cover them. Except in emergencies , these procedures require authorization prior to the event. Your health care plan explains which health care activities needs prior authorization or approval. Who is responsible for obtaining a prior authorization? If you are going to an in -network provider, they are responsible . If you are using an out -of-network provider, you or the physician who orders the test or performs the procedure will be responsible for obtaining approval from your insurer. Factors to Consider: As the consumer, you will want to make sure that prior authorization ha s been obtained as you will be responsible for the entire bill if the approval is not in place. In some plans, failure to seek prior authorization for scheduled hospitalization , even for an in -network provider , will result in a penalty to be deducted from what the insurance plan will reimburse. Y ou will then be responsible for paying your provider the amount of the penalty that was not reimbursed by your plan. Prior approvals for services of out -of-network providers mean that the services will be reimburs ed based on the maximum allowable amounts applicable for the plan; it is not a guarantee that the plan will reimburse at NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 8 the prices charged by the provider. How to choose an insurance plan Your employer offers the choice of two plans : Aetna and Empire Blue Cross , and a supplementary Dental Plan from Cigna . Members of your family who work in the US may receive health insurance through their employers. T here are different rules and protocols regarding health benefits so please read this section i n your Handbook carefully, since there may be a cost savings if you are able to access benefits from both your plan and one in which your spouse is enrolled. Here are some of the factors to consider in cho osing a medical insurance plan: * Your health needs and those of members of your family: Young families without significant chronic health issues may do well wi th a plan that pays primarily for in - network coverage, i.e. a health maintenance organisation or Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO). The assumption here is that your health needs are simple and can be taken care of through the plan. If it is anticipated that you or a family member will require medical care from a number of specialists, expensive medications, and/or complicated medical procedures, then a plan with more flexibility and health care options might be best for you, i.e. a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) or one with good out -of-network benefits. Cost of deductibles, co -pays, and monthly rates, and scope of coverage: For example, does the plan cover eye glasses, hearing aids, psychotherapy, dietary counselling and alternative medicine pro viders? These benefits are usually listed under a section called \"Schedule of Benefits\" and it is recommended that you review the Schedule of Benefits section to see which plan best fits you and your family's health needs. The possibility o f accidents or sudden diagnosis of serious illness: Accidents should be considered in selecting your plan, even if you and your family are generally healthy and may not need regular care. Like those of other employers, UN insurance plans have strict rules about enrolling in a plan or switching to another plan at any given time. If you are suddenly diagnosed with a serious illness or in an accident, you will not be entitled to join a plan or switch to a plan with better benefits at your convenience. Therefor e, you should not only consider the monthly costs but also carefully review the plan's benefits and coverage. * Some of these considerations will only be relevant to plans other than Aetna or EBC, while others apply to both. Cigna Dental Preferred Provid er Organization (PPO) Plan The dental PPO programme offers a large network of participating providers in the Greater New York Metropolitan area and nationally. A dental PPO functions like medical PPO: the network of dentists who participate in the CIGNA d ental PPO plan accept as payment a fee schedule negotiated with CIGNA. When covered services are rendered by an in -network provider, CIGNA reimburses the dentist according to the schedule and the participant normally has no out -of-pocket expense. One may a lso choose a NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 9 What to expect when you visit a physician's off ice Making the first appointment: When you call to set up an initial visit, you might want to ask a few questions before going forward with the conversation : Are they taking new patients? When is the first available appointment? Do they acce pt your insurance plan? Are they part of the network of your insurance plan? (Practices change their insurance panels without much notice, so it is always good to check.) In most offices, staff may inquire as to the nature of your medical prob lem. Are you calling for a wellness examination i.e., a routine check -up, or is the problem acute and requiring an immediate appointment? If you have special needs, such as requiring an appointment within a specific time frame, let the staff know tha t as well. Some offices may also ask for your insurance information while making the initial appointment. Your medical appointment: It is recommended that you arrive 10 to 15 minutes before your first appointment since you will be asked to complete paperwork that includes providing you r and your family's medical history, any medications you are currently taking, any allergies , etc. You should be ready with that information. You will also be asked to sign forms regarding medical confidentiality as well as your agreement to be personally responsible for any costs that the insurance plan will not or will only partially reimburse. Some offices may also have their registration forms online, which you may complete at home and bring to your first appointment. Offices have different routines: In some doctor's offices you will be seen initially by a medical assistant who prepares you for the visit. The medical assistant will ask you to disrobe and put on an examination gown, take your height, weight and blood pressure, and collect information about your presenting problem. In other offices, the physician may speak with you first and obtain your medical history and then ask you to go into a separate area to disrobe and put on NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 10 an examination gown.1 After the examination you will be asked to dress and the physician will speak with you about their findings and make recommendations . Primary Care The p rimary care physician (prime or \"PCP\") is the cornersto ne of medical care in the US. The primary care physician offers continuous and comprehensive care, helps to organize referrals to specialists, administers preventive care , and is first in the line of c ontact for most medical problems. Primary care physicians are general internal medicine physicians, pediatricians and family physicians who see both children and adults. Many women, particularly those of child -bearing age, receive their basic care from a specialist in women's health called an obstetrician gynaecologist (Ob-Gyn), who also provides many of the recommended preventive care services. The Ob -Gyn is not considered a primary care physician in most systems . Most insurance plans require yo u to sign up with a primary care doctor who manages your medical care. While both UN plans do not generally require referrals from your primary care physician to seek care from specialists, there are specific situations where a written referral would be us eful; these are described in your plan's document. It is recommended you select a primary care physician who can advise you about health matters and help navigate the complexities of the US health care system. Primary care practices are organized in many different forms and you , the consumer , have a choice of which one you want to sign up for. Before deciding, however, you should determine in advance whether they accept your insurance and if they are in -network or out-of-network. For example, some practices do not take insurance and require the consumer to pay out-of-pocket . If you choose this option, you are responsible for negotiating reimbursement with the insurance company. Here are a few of the practice mode ls: 1 Respect for patient privacy is a well -articulated value in the US health care system. There should be a private place for disrobing and dressing and instructions given about how much disrobing is required, e.g., outer garments, all your garment s, etc. The examination gown or garment s should provide adequate cove ring to preserve your modesty. There should be some discussion about the extent of the examination before you are asked to undress. When a male physician is examining a disrobed female patient, there is usually a female c haperone present and/or you ma y request one to be present. It is important that you have time to ask questions : Make sure that you prepare a list of questions before your visit. You would likely have time to ask these questions during your post -examination session with the doctor. When you leave the office, you should have a clear picture of what the doctor thinks about your health picture and what is recommend ed as the next steps in your ongoing medical care. A re instructions for testing or follow -up plans clear and have all your questions been answered? If you are not being asked to return to the office for a follow -up visit, make sure you know how you can obtain the results of any investigations that are bein g ordered. NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 11 Private practice offices : There are hundreds of private offices throughout the New York metropolitan area out of which a single physician or group of physicians provide medical services. Medical practitioners can decide to sign up with a wide arra y of medical plans and insurance providers, go with only a few, or none at all. Multispecialty groups: These are private practice groups that, in addition to having primary care physicians on staff, offer a broad array of specialty services. Community clinics: These offer another way for physicians and other medical providers to work together in comprehensive care groups. Many community clinics are subsidized by the government, which means they have to accept a broader range of insurance plans, and meet certain standards for hours of service, range of services provided , and after -hours coverage. Hospital -based practices: Most hospitals in the New York metropolitan area are associated with an ambulatory (outpatient) clinic that has primary car e physicians as well as specialty clinics. Most also have teaching programs that include post -graduate medical trainees as providers. Hospital affiliated medical practices: Many of the larger hospitals in the New York metropolitan area have created netw orks of affiliated medical practices that extend to different boroughs and even to different states. In addition to providing primary and specialty care services, these practices refer to the parent hospital for diagnostic studies, hospitalizations, additi onal specialty care and/or emergency care. Concierge medical practices: A new development in primary health care delivery is the growth of what are called concierge medical practices. Usually made up of one or more physicians, these practices charge a y early membership fee, in exchange for more convenient and personalized service s for you, the consumer . Your insurance plan is used to cover most medical expenses; the yearly membership fee range s from $150 t o $5,000 and not reimbursed by the insurance plan . This fee pays for \"amenities\" such as email and phone access to physicians, same day appointments, no (or short) waiting times , and online appointment scheduling. Some concie rge offices take a wide range of medical insurances, while others are very limited. Most, if not all, of these concierge practices are considered out -of-network providers and claims will be reimbursed by the plan accordingly. More information about concierge practices in New York is available online. NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 12 How to find a primary care physician: A good place to start is the online site provided by your insurance company that lists all physicians who have contracted with them to be in -network providers. This l isting is organized by specialty and location (borough). Primary care physicians are listed under general internal medicine, paediatricians , and/or family practice. Friends and colleagues are also a good source of referral, or you may find it convenient t o locate a medical practice that is close to where you live or work . If you or family members have a complex set of medical needs, attending a hospital or hospital -affiliated practice might be the most convenient, as medical information is most easily sha red within these systems. Once you have l ocated a primary care physician , you can go online and find consumer ratings of individual physicians and other information that may help you select a primary care physician. Although changing your health i nsurance plan can only be done once a year during the UN official enrolment period, changing your primary care physician can be done at any time. You should not feel locked into any choice since it is very important to find a physician that you trust and with whom you feel comfortable. Specialist Care The medical care system considers a specialist to be any provider other than your primary care physician; specialists can be in -network or out -of- network. While both UN plans do not generally require referrals from your primary care physician to seek care from specialists, it is recommended to get a written referral anytime you are planning a visit to any kind of specialist. This will insure that your primary care physician receives a written report from the specialist and that your medical care (and documentation of your medical history) is coordinated from one place. An exception to the referral rule is women's health, where referrals are generally not required for visits to obstet rician gynaecologists (Ob-Gyn) . While as dermatology or ophthalmology , can be relatively straightforward procedures, you are advised to prepare in advance for specialty visits that address more complex medical issues. Make sure to ask your primary care physician for copies of relevant laboratory and radiological studies, a referral note , and copies of letters from all other specialists you have seen for the problem. NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 13 Preventive Care Preventive care is widely accepted as an essential ingredient of the US health care system. Preventive care and preventive care guidelines are highly protocolized and are based on an understanding that some medical conditions can be almost completely prevent ed with immunizations, a healthier diet and exercise, smoking cessation, and/or other conditions can be vastly mitigated through early detection with screenings such as mammograms, PAP smears, colonoscopies, and early interventions such a removal of prema lignant polyps from the colon. Preventive care guidelines have been established by a number of expert organizations , however, there are some difference s of opinion among them as to what constitu tes necessary preventive care. When you visit your primary care physician and/or Ob -Gyn, they will advise you on preventive care procedures and recommended health screenings. Most health insurances cover the cost of preventative care services, and include a co-pay. These services often include an annual physi cal exam, immunizations, routine obstetrician -gynaecologist exams , mammography and PSA screenings. Additional information on the preventative care s ervice s covered by your health can be accessed online : Aetna: hr.iu.edu/benefits/pubs/misc/students -PreventiveCareCoverage.pdf Empire Blue Cross empireblue.com/preventive -care/ Finding a specialist: The best source for finding a specialist is your primary care physician, who would generally work within a network of specialists. A second source is your insurance plan, which can give you names of in - network specialists in your area. F or complicated and or more serious health concerns, you may request a referral to a specialist who practices at one of the specialty hospitals - cancer, joint disease, eye and ear problems or one of the larger academic medical centres in the city - such as New York University Medical Center, Columbia Presbyterian, Mount Sinai and New York Cornell. Second opinions: Most insurance plans allow for a second opinion when a surgical procedure is advised. If you have any questions or doubts about the need for a surgical procedure, it is your right to ask for a second opinion from another spec ialist in the same field. Your primary care physician can arrange for a second opinion referral. The UN's insurance plans will cover the cost of doctor's visit for a second opinion in accordance with the plan rules for in- and out -of-network visits. NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 14 Basic preventive care recommendation s include: Children: Starting in the first few months of life, there is a regular schedule of immunizations and examinations recommended for infants and children in the US. Children entering school are required by law to be immunized against common preve ntable diseases such as mumps, measles, chicken pox and many others. Parents should ensure to keep all documentation of their child's immunization history as they will likely be needed for school entry. Children at 11 or 12 years old should get two courses of the HPV vaccine 6 to 12 months apart. Women and men between the ages of 50 and 75 : are advised to have a screening procedure for early detection of cancer of the colon. The most common recommendation is for a colonoscopy every 10 years. Women between the ages of 50 and 74 : are advised to have a mammogram screening every two years for early detection of breast cancer. Women between the ages of 21 and 65 : are advised to have a PAP smear no more than every three years to screen for cance r of the cervix. Adult immunizations: Diphtheria/Tetanus immunization is recommended every 10 years . Immunizations to prevent influenza (flu) and pneumonia are recommended for people over 65 years of age , and those at higher risk for medical complicat ions due to influenza. Regardless of prior history of chicken pox, adults over 50 are advised to receive 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine (RSV) or one dose of zoster vaccine live (ZVL) to prevent shingles. Smoking cessation: There have been active campaigns throughout the US over the past 10 years in support of smoking cessation If you are a smoker, your primary care physician can advise you on smoking cessation methods. Emergency and Urgent Care In planning for your medical care , it is recommended to learn in advance what to do in the case of urgent or emergen cy medical problems. There are a number of options for dealing with health problems requiring immediate attention that arise outside of your primary care physician's regula r office hours. Many primary care offices have after -hours phone coverage. During your first visit to the office, ask what kind of aft er-hours coverage they provide. It is always preferable to call your primary care physician's office for a consultation before you seek outside care. They may suggest you come into the office, refer you to an urgent care centre , and/or emergency room or send you directly to the hospital for admission. NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 15 Urgent care centres or walk -in centres. Urgent care centres offer an alternative to emergency room care. These centres are scattered throughout the New York metropolitan area and do not require appointments. They take a range of insurance plans, and usually have on -site x -ray and laboratory facilities. Urgent care cent res can provide diagnosis and treatment for many acute medical problems without the lengthy waiting time that one often encounters in the emergency room. You may want to locate an urgent care centre in your neighbourhood , and ask in advance if they accept your insurance plan. There are no rules for determining a true medical emergency. A sudden loss of one's capacity to speak, reason, move and/or perform ordinary life activities may be considered an emergency , as might severe pain, high fevers, large blood loss , etc. The city's emergency care system can be accessed by dialling 911. An ambulance with a trained crew of emergency medical technicians will be dispatched to your location and bring you to the nearest hospital. Most large hospitals in the New Yor k metropolitan area have emergency rooms that serve as the entry point for people who need acute hospitalization. It is also possible to walk into a hospital emergency system on your own. Emergency rooms are run on a triage system , i.e. the si ckest patients take priority. At the entry station you will be seen by trained medical personnel who assess the urgency of your medical needs, and who track your care based on the severity of their assessment. When going to an emergency room with a non-emergent problem, it is common to wait four or five hours to access service and, depending on the time of day and/or month, expe rience a great deal of crowding . Urgent care centres may be a better alternative for non -life threatening situations as they are less costly and time -consuming. Most plans penalize members for using emergency rooms for non -emergency conditions . By only covering a portion of the service cost, which can leave you with a sizeable out -of-pocket expense , consulting with your primary care physicians' office prior to going to an emergency room is advised . If i emergency care is required, your primary care physician can inform the Emergency Room in advance that you will be arriving, which often makes for a much more efficient visit. Women's Health Care Women's health care can be organized through different systems. Some primary care physicians, particularly those from family practice, offer routine wom en's health care : PAP smea rs, contraceptive couns elling and pregnancy counselling . Some women prefer to go to a woman's health specialist, an Obstetrician -Gynaecologist (colloquially called an \"O -B-G-Y-N\",) for all their women's health care and your insurance plan will cover t hose visits. There are also many clinics - family planning, Planned Parenthood, and others - that specialize in wom en's health care during the reproductive years. These clinics offer women's health services, contraceptive counse lling and, in som e cases, termination of pregnancy. There is a listing of these clinics in the Appendix. NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 16 Pregnancy Care: Although some family practitioners provide obstetric care, most of the obstetric care in the US is provi ded by women 's health specialists - an Ob-Gyn and/or a midwife specializing in Obstetrics. Deliveries are performed mainly in the hospital and patients have a choice of birthing procedures : natural, with anaesthesia , or in a birthing suite . These possibilities are generally discussed in adva nce with the patient. There is a small movement towards home birthing in the US and t hese deliveries are done by mid wives. As in much of US medicine, safety is a major concern. Pregnancies during the final stages are monitored closely , and if there is an y sign that the birthing process is not going well, or that the unborn baby is in distress, a caesarean section or \"C-section\" is advised. The US has a higher rate of C-section relative to many other countries, driven by risk management practices. Expe ctant mothers are also advised to contact their insurance company to discuss any related benefits that may be covered by the plan. Breastfeeding services are provided to UN members to facilitate an easier transition to work. Duty stations in New Y ork, Geneva, Vienna, and Nairobi provide private lactation rooms with refrigerators to store milk. Other duty stations are required to provide similar services. Staff members are allowed time off during the day to express milk or breast feed if their infan t is under 1 year of age. Th is time may be up to 2 hours if commuting or 1 hour if expressing milk. Lactation consultation and breast pumps are covered by Aetna and Empire BCBS. Visit your insurance website to find the providers and supply companies . In order to receive more information on lactation services, please refer to the UN Lactation Handbook in the HR Portal (hr.un.org) . Other Issues Communication There is an increasing interest in US medicine on improving communication between the doctor and the patient. Doctor -patient communication is now a regular part of the medical school curriculum and most post -graduate primary physician programs offer additional training. An informed and active patient is considered the ideal and much attention is being devoted to achieving this ideal. The expectation is that the patient and family will ask questions and can expect answers from health care providers, and patients will be active partners in making health care decisions. Below are some of the things you can do to increase the likelihood of having a satisfyin g experience with your doctor. These recommendations are particularly applicab le for consultations with specialists : Come to the visit prepared with questions. Think about what you want to accomplish with the visit. Many people do web research prior to a planned visit, and most physicians expect to be asked questions based on this research. NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 17 If you are being referred to a specialist , ask your primary care physician why you are being referred and what ques tions do you want to ask the specialist . Bring all relevant laboratory and consultation reports with you to a specialist visit. Bring a family member or friend with you to your medical visit . To help process what you're learning , you may want to bring someone else with you as you may feel overwhelmed by the amount of information provided by physicians or other medica l personnel. You can request to have them with you during the initial interview and post -exam discussion. Ask questions. If there is terminology you do not understand, ask for clarification. If a test is being ordered that you do not understand about , ask about it. Why is it being ordered? What does it involve? Treatment recommendations . Whether the treatment be medication s, medical procedures, surgery or something else , ask about what you can expect while undergoing treatment, about possible side effects, the a nticipated recovery period, and anything else that may concern you . Language Comprehension New York City is a polyglot culture and, to some extent, this is recognized in the medical care system. Public hospitals and clinics are required to have a pa nel of interpreters , or phone interpreters , available to serve non-English speaking clients. Private medical offices offer a variety of language skills. When researching a physician on the web you will find information about the languages in which a physi cian and/or his/her office staff is fluent. It is also permissible to bring a family member to help with translation. Confidentiality There is a great deal of emphasis on patient confidentiality in the US health care system. You, the patient, have the right to decide who has access to your medical information. Your written permission is required for your medical information to be sent to another doctor, medical faculty, insurance company or lawyer. Your verbal permission is required for family members, including your spouse, to be given details about your medical condition. Adolescents 18 years and older are considered emancipated and enjoy the same right to confidentiality as other adults in the family. There are specific situations such as fa mily planning and treatment for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) where adolescents under the age of 18 can request confidentiality for their medical treatment. Electronic Medical Records The Electronic Medical Record (EMR) is a digital system used b y hospitals and clinics to store secure health -related information. The EMR allows physicians and health care providers to access their patients' medical history in an efficient manner. Any health care providers assigned to your care has access to these r ecords. All information in the EMR is confidential and protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). You may request a copy of your medical records if desired. NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 18 Patient Portals There is an increasing use of patient portals i n US hospitals and clinics. Patient portals are secure websites where you may access your personal health information. After setting up a secure username and password, you can access information on your recent visits, laboratory results, and medications. S ome patient portals allow you to communicate directly with the provider or clinic through secure online chat services. This provides you with the opportunity to ask questions on your care or request for medication refills. Additionally, you may fill out on line forms prior to your visit to save waiting time. All information in patient portals are secure and protected by HIPAA. Advance Directives and Living Wills All patients have the right to make decisions regarding e nd-of-life care. These decis ions are codified under the term, \"advance directives.\" Elements of advance directives include: Living will: This legal written document spells out the types of medical treatments and life - sustaining measures , such as mechanical breathing (respiration a nd ventilation), tube feeding or resuscitation ; you want or do not want. In some states, living wills may be called Health Care Declarations or Health Care Directives. Medical or health care Power of Attorney (POA): The medical POA is a legal document tha t designates an individual - referred to as your health care agent or proxy - who can make medical decisions for you in the event that you are incapacitated . However, a medical POA is different than a Power of Attorney that authorizes someone to make finan cial transactions for you. Do not Resuscitate (DNR) order: This is a request to not have cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if your heart stops or if you stop breathing. Some people feel that it is helpful for everyone, regardless of health status, to have advance directives. Others consider them relevant only when a medical situation arises during which they might be required. On admission to the hospital, most people are asked to name a health car e proxy or POA, and sign for other directives. Elderl y patients are all encouraged to have advance directives and your doctor's office may ask you if you have them. Hospitalization For most people, hospitalization is a significant life event. Hospital rules and protocols disturb our life rhythms and dai ly habits. The food is generally not to our taste and sleep is interrupted. If you are in the hospital, however, chances are you really need to be there. There has been a trend in US health care to limit hospitalizations, and the time one spends in the hos pital. Many surgical procedures are now performed in an ambulatory outpatient setting, which means you check in on the day of surgery, have the surgery, and return home the same day. Hospitalization stays have also become quite abbreviated. For example, the standard hospitalization for a normal childbirth is 24 to 48 hours and 96 hours post -caesarean section. Limiting these stays has proven to be a health benefit as recovery and rehabilitation are most effectively carried out away from the disruptive rhy thms of the hospital. If it is not feasible to have what you need for recovery in your home, there are rehabilitation units at most hospitals where NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 19 people can stay for a limited perio d. Your plan provides coverage for a rehabilitation unit stay and/or some level of post -hospital discharge home care if it is medically necessary. Hospital admissions are arranged by a physician, and which hospital you enter is determined by your admitting physician. For example, a surgical procedure will be scheduled at a hospital chosen by the surgeon. In the case of an emergency, you will be taken to the nearest hospital and, if hospitalization is required, you will be admitted to that hospital and assigned a physician if your primary care physician is not on their s taff. Most hospitals in the New York metropolitan area are teaching or training hospitals , so you will be visited by many different levels of physician providers. Expect to be asked frequen tly to give your name and birthdate by every provider you encounter . This preoccupation with patient identification is part of an entire system developed to prevent medical errors. If it is not clear to you or your family which physician is in charge of your care, it is important to ask for their name and contact number, so that you can request copies of your hospital record to be sent to your primary care physician. Upon discharge, you will be given a discharge summary that lists prescribed medications and follow -up recommendations. Hospitals here g enerally have their own visitation rules and guidelines, including specific visitation hours and limits on the number of visitors a patient can receive at any one time. Most hospitals here do not permit visitors to sleep or stay overnight in the patient 's room, unless specifically authorized. Your plans reimburse 100% of hospitalization costs when your care is provided in -network , and coverage is for a semi - private room. If you are taken to an out -of-network hospital due to an emergency, most plans will reimburse for the full cost of care. Make sure to check your medical insurance plan. Prescription Drug Coverage Medications or prescription drugs Medications can be a major contributor to your medical expenses. Although both UN insurance plans offer prescription drug benefits, there are a few things to know about medications, and prescribing in the US, that may help reduce out -of-pocket costs. Over -the-counter versus prescription medications: Your prescription drug benefit applies only to those m edications that are prescribed by a licensed provider. You can buy many medications for pain, colds, stomach problems, etc., as well as vitamins and supplements, without a prescription (often referred to as \"over -the-counter\") . However, these costs will no t be reimbursed under your pharmacy benefit plan . NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 20 Generic drugs: Many of the commonly used medications, antibiotics, hypertension , and heart disease medicines are available in generic form. Generic medications are highly regulated in the US and most are equivalent in strength and quality to brand name medications. Your prescription drug benefit offers the best coverage (the least out -of-pocket costs) when generic medications are used. Most US doctors will prescribe generic drugs if available. If you choo se a branded drug instead, you will be responsible for the price difference. Choosing to use generic medicine is an important contribution to keeping insurance costs affordable. In-network and out -of-network: Pharmacies are also in -network and out -of network. Your drug benefit gives the best coverage when an in -network pharmacy is used. Mail order: The insurance plans also have contracts with mail order pharmacies that will issue a 90-day supply of medications to you , the patient , at considerable cost savings. Mail order prescriptions are most effective for chronic or long -term medications. Remember to ask your physician to write a prescription for a 90-day supply of medication when you plan to use an in - network mail -order pharmacy. Prior approvals : Certain medications like for cancer treatment, transplantations, or rare blood diseases , are highly specialized and have no generic alternatives . \"No generic alternatives\" mean they are expensive and generate high out -of-pocket costs. The cost of these medications can be substantially reduced if your physician requests a \"prior approval\" from your insurer and make s the case for a lower cost since the re is no substitute available for the medication. Special Concerns Mental Health Problems Mental h ealth care in the US, also referred to as behavioural health, is organized quite separately from your other healthcare systems and may be difficult to access without some guidelines. Within the mental health system there is a strong bias toward psychophar macology , and many psychiatrists in the US limit their practices to diagnosing and presc ribing psychiatric medication. They are calle d psychopharmacologists. Therapy, counselling or medication for emotional problems is very common in the US and seems to carry fewer stigmas than in other cultures. Below are some guidelines for using the mental health care system: If you are faced with a mental health emergency : such as marked changes in behaviour NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 21 and/or thought processes not related to an acute physical i llness or medications, there are a number of hospital -based psychiatric emergency rooms throughout the metropolitan area where you or family member s can be seen for evaluation and, if needed, be admitted to a psychiatric facility for in -patient treatment. There is a list of hospitals that have psychiatric emergency facilities in the index. If you or a family member is experiencing a marked change in emotional behaviour or has an existing mental health problem, it is advisable to access this type of psychiat ric emergency facility rather than a regular emergency room where personnel are trained to respond to psychiatric emergencies and can make appropriate decisions about follow -up care ). Ongoing psychiatric or psychotherapy care : can be given by a psychiatr ist, a therapist or a mental health clinic that provides both services. It is not uncommon for an individual with emotional problems to see both a psychiatrist for medications and a therapist - who is usually a clinical psychologist or clinical social work er. Note that m any therapists have early morning or late afternoon/evening appointments to accommodate working people. Preventive care: There is a fair amount of public discussion about the need for more preventive mental health services but little agreem ent as to what those services should be. Your insurance plans offer fairly comprehensive coverage for mental health counselling and people are encouraged to seek counselling for persistent feelings of depression, anxiety, or uncontrollable anger. Schools will often inform parents if they feel a child needs behavioural evaluation and/or counselling based on how he/she is functioning in the classroom. In-patient, residential and out -patient treatment for substance and/or alcohol abuse : Most cases will be covered by your plan. There are many specialized facilities that treat drug and alcohol problems, a list of which is in the index as well as your provider netwo rk directory. Your primary care physician can generally help with a referral to a ne twork facility. Alternative Medical Practice s Coverage of alternative or naturopathic medical practices is limited to acupuncture, chiropractic services and nutritional counselling when you go to an in -net-work provider. Other practices such as homeopat hy, massage therapy, nutritional supplements, and movement therapy are not covered services and generally will not be reimbursed. Staff Counsellor's Office at UN Headquarter s The Staff Counsellor's Office (SCO) is a primary point of contact for UN s taff members to recei ve support and professional counselling when facing crisis or personal concerns including stress, How to find an in -network mental health professional or treatment facility: Your network provider directory, which can be accessed online, has listings with co ntact numbers for \"behavioural health providers.\" This is a good place to start as there is a benefit, as in other aspects of your care, to seeing an in -network provider. Your primary care physician may have suggestions for both talk therapy and psychophar macologists, and some primary care physicians feel comfortable prescribing psychiatric medications themselves. NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE USA 22 anxiety, depression, grief, burnout, substance abuse, relationship issues, or reaction to a traumatic event .

This was a collective work of numerous UN and non -UN colleagues, all of whom were committed to making it user -friendly and responsive to the needs o f UN personnel and their family . The initial draft of this Handbook was prepared for the UN Medical Services Division (MSD) by Dr. Susan Massad, a general medicine doctor based in New York with over 40 years of medical experience. Contributors from the Medical Services Division inclu de Dr. Michael Rowell, who first suggested the idea of this Handbook; James Gibson and Dr. Abdalla Mansour Amer who provided valuable feedback to the document; and Dr. Esther Tan, who coordinated the overall review of the draft by relevant parties . Spec ial thanks and appreciation are given to staff from the UN Health and Li fe Insurance Division for their important contributions to the Handbook on insurance -related matters ; the OHRM Communications team on the design and disseminat ion of the Handbook ; and the New York Local Expatriate Spouse Association (NYLESA) for their review of the document . Finally, M SD gratefully acknowledges all staff of the UN for their valuable feedback to this document .
