In order to explore related topics, please visit [navigation](/wiki/Template:Philosophy_of_science). This is a list of topics that have, either currently or in the past, been characterized as [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience) by academics or researchers. Detailed discussion of these topics may be found on their main pages. These characterizations were made in the context of educating the public about questionable or potentially fraudulent or dangerous claims and practices\u2014efforts to define the nature of [science](/wiki/Science), or humorous parodies of poor scientific reasoning. Criticism of pseudoscience, generally by the [scientific community](/wiki/Scientific_community) or [skeptical](/wiki/Scientific_skepticism) organizations, involves critiques of the [logical](/wiki/Logic), [methodological](/wiki/Scientific_method), or [rhetorical](/wiki/Rhetoric) bases of the topic in question. [[1]](#cite_note-Pollak2002-1) Though some of the listed topics continue to be investigated scientifically, others were only subject to scientific research in the past and today are considered refuted, but resurrected in a pseudoscientific fashion. Other ideas presented here are entirely non-scientific, but have in one way or another impinged on scientific domains or practices. Many adherents or practitioners of the topics listed here dispute their characterization as pseudoscience. Each section here summarizes the alleged pseudoscientific aspects of that topic. Physical sciences Astronomy and space sciences [2012 phenomenon](/wiki/2012_phenomenon)- a range of [eschatological](/wiki/Eschatology) [beliefs](/wiki/Belief)that cataclysmic or otherwise transformative events would occur on or around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the [Mesoamerican Long Count calendar](/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar)and as such, festivities to commemorate the date took place on 21 December 2012 in the countries that were part of the [Maya civilization](/wiki/Maya_civilization)(Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador), with main events at [Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1](/wiki/Chich%C3%A9n_Itz%C3%A1)in Mexico and [Tikal](/wiki/Tikal)in Guatemala. Professional [Mayanist](/wiki/Mayanist)scholars stated that no extant [classic Maya accounts](/wiki/Maya_codices)forecast impending doom and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented [Maya history](/wiki/Maya_civilization#History)and culture, [[2]](#cite_note-2)while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations. [[3]](#cite_note-3) [Ancient astronauts](/wiki/Ancient_astronauts)- a concept based on the belief that intelligent [extraterrestrial beings](/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life)visited Earth and made contact with humans in [antiquity](/wiki/Ancient_history)and [prehistoric](/wiki/Prehistoric)times. Proponents suggest that this contact influenced the development of modern cultures, technologies and religions. A common claim is that [deities](/wiki/Deity)from most, if not all, religions are actually extraterrestrial in origin and that advanced technologies brought to Earth by ancient astronauts were interpreted as evidence of divine status by early humans. The idea that ancient astronauts existed is not taken seriously by academics and has received no credible attention in [peer-reviewed](/wiki/Peer-review)studies. [[4]](#cite_note-4) [Anunnaki from Nibiru (Sitchin)](/wiki/Ancient_astronauts#Zecharia_Sitchin)(variant) - proposed by [Zecharia Sitchin](/wiki/Zecharia_Sitchin)in his series The Earth Chronicles, beginning with The 12th Planet (1976), it revolves around Sitchin's unique interpretation of ancient [Sumerian](/wiki/Sumerian_language)and [Middle Eastern](/wiki/Middle_East)texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts from around the world. He hypothesizes that the gods of old [Mesopotamia](/wiki/Mesopotamia)were actually astronauts from the planet \" [Nibiru](/wiki/Nibiru_(Sitchin))\", which Sitchin claims the Sumerians believed was a remote \"12th planet\" (counting the Sun, Moon and Pluto as planets) associated with the god [Marduk](/wiki/Marduk). According to Sitchin, Nibiru continues to orbit the Sun on a 3,600-year orbit. [[5]](#cite_note-Skepdic-5) [Ancient astronauts Temple](/wiki/Robert_K._G._Temple)'s proposal Sirius Mystery](/wiki/The_Sirius_Mystery)(1976) argues that the [Dogon people](/wiki/Dogon_people)of northwestern [Mali](/wiki/Mali)preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He quotes various lines of evidence, including supposed advanced astronomical knowledge inherited by the tribe, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations such as [ancient Egypt](/wiki/Ancient_Egypt)and [Sumer](/wiki/Sumer). [[6]](#cite_note-Temple_1999_p.-6) - [Astrology](/wiki/Astrology)(see also [Astrology and science](/wiki/Astrology_and_science)) - consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world. Several systems of divination are based on the [relative positions and movement](/wiki/Apparent_retrograde_motion#Apparent_motion)of various real and construed celestial bodies. [Scientific testing](/wiki/Astrology#Scientific_analysis_and_criticism)of astrology has been conducted and no evidence has been found to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions. [[7]](#cite_note-Zarka-7)Where astrology has made [falsifiable](/wiki/Falsifiable)predictions, it has been falsified. [[7]](#cite_note-Zarka-7): 424 [Creationist cosmologies](/wiki/Creationist_cosmologies)are explanations of the origins and form of the [universe](/wiki/Universe)in terms of the [Genesis creation narrative](/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative)(Genesis 1), according to which the [God](/wiki/God)of the Bible created the cosmos in eight creative acts over the six days of the \"creation week\". [[8]](#cite_note-Hendel_2013_p.-8) - Evidence for [life on Mars](/wiki/Life_on_Mars) on Mars](/wiki/Cydonia_(region_of_Mars)#\"Face_on_Mars\")is a rock formation in [Cydonia Mensae](/wiki/Cydonia_(region_of_Mars))on Mars asserted to be evidence of intelligent, native life on the planet. High-resolution images taken recently show it to appear less face-like. [[9]](#cite_note-NASA_face-9)It features prominently in the works of [Richard C. Hoagland](/wiki/Richard_C._Hoagland)and [Tom Van Flandern](/wiki/Tom_Van_Flandern). [[10]](#cite_note-Hoagland_2001_p.-10) [[11]](#cite_note-Flandern_1998_p.-11)This effect can also be explained by the psychological phenomenon [pareidolia](/wiki/Pareidolia), whereby one assigns meaning (such as facial perception) to an otherwise ambiguous or meaningless stimulus. [Lunar effect](/wiki/Lunar_effect)- the belief that the full Moon influences human behavior. [[12]](#cite_note-skepdic_lunar-12) [Modern flat Earth beliefs](/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_beliefs)propose that Earth is a flat, disc-shaped planet that accelerates upward, producing the illusion of [gravity](/wiki/Gravity). Proposers of a flat Earth, such as the [Flat Earth Research Society](/wiki/International_Flat_Earth_Research_Society), do not accept compelling evidence, such as photos of Earth from space. [[13]](#cite_note-Dure_2016-13) [Modern geocentrism](/wiki/Modern_geocentrism)- In astronomy, the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism or the Ptolemaic system) is a [superseded](/wiki/Superseded_scientific_theories)description of the universe with Earth at the center. Under the geocentric model, the Sun, Moon, stars and planets all circled Earth. The geocentric model served as the predominant description of the cosmos in many ancient civilizations, such as those of Aristotle and Ptolemy. [[14]](#cite_note-Numbers_1993_p.-14) [Moon landing conspiracy theories](/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories)- claim that some or all elements of the [Apollo program](/wiki/Apollo_program)and the associated Moon landings were hoaxes staged by NASA with the aid of other organizations. The most notable claim is that the six crewed landings (1969-72) were faked and that 12 Apollo astronauts did not actually walk on the Moon. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened by manufacturing, tampering with or destroying evidence, including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions and Moon rock samples, and even killing some key witnesses. [[15]](#cite_note-Plait_2002_p.-15) [Nibiru cataclysm](/wiki/Nibiru_cataclysm)- a prediction first made by [contactee](/wiki/Contactee)Nancy Lieder that a mythological planet [Nibiru](/wiki/Nibiru_(Sitchin))would collide with Earth. After having adjusted her prediction many times, she later claimed the year of the occurrence to be 2012. [[16]](#cite_note-16)In 2017, a [conspiracy theorist](/wiki/Conspiracy_theory)known as Nibiru would hit. [Vaimnika Shstra](/wiki/Vaim%C4%81nika_Sh%C4%81stra)- claim that airplanes were invented in [ancient India](/wiki/Ancient_India)during the [Vedic period](/wiki/Vedic_period). A 1974 study by researchers at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Science,_Bangalore)found that the heavier-than-air aircraft that the Vaimnika Shstra described were aerodynamically unfeasible. The authors remarked that the discussion of the principles of flight in the text were largely perfunctory and incorrect, in some cases violating [Newton's laws of motion](/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion). [[17]](#cite_note-17) [Worlds in Collision](/wiki/Worlds_in_Collision)- writer [Immanuel Velikovsky](/wiki/Immanuel_Velikovsky)proposed in his book Worlds in Collision that ancient texts and geographic evidence show mankind was witness to catastrophic interactions of other planets in our Solar System. [[18]](#cite_note-18) Earth sciences [Megalithic geometry](/wiki/Pseudoscientific_metrology#\"Megalithic_geometry\")or 366 geometry - posits the existence of an [Earth](/wiki/Earth)-based [geometry](/wiki/Geometry)dating back to at least 3500 BCE and the possibility that such a system is still in use in modern [Freemasonry](/wiki/Freemasonry). According to proponents, [megalithic](/wiki/Megalithic)civilizations in Britain and Brittany had advanced knowledge of geometry and the size of Earth. The [megalithic yard](/wiki/Megalithic_yard)is correlated to the polar circumference of Earth using a circle divided into 366 degrees. [[19]](#cite_note-HistoryOfComputers-19) [[20]](#cite_note-NISTReport-20) - The [Bermuda Triangle](/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle)- a region of the Atlantic Ocean that lies between Bermuda, Puerto Rico and (in its most popular version) Florida. Ship and aircraft disasters and disappearances perceived as frequent in this area have led to the circulation of stories of unusual natural phenomena, paranormal encounters and interactions with [extraterrestrials](/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life). [[21]](#cite_note-NOVA,1976-21) [Climate change denial](/wiki/Climate_change_denial)- involves denial, dismissal, unwarranted doubt or contrarian views which depart from the scientific consensus on [climate change](/wiki/Climate_change), including the extent to which it is caused by humans, its impacts on nature and human society, or the potential of adaptation to global warming by human actions. [[22]](#cite_note-22) [[23]](#cite_note-NCSE-why-denial-23) [[24]](#cite_note-24) [Flood geology](/wiki/Flood_geology)- creationist form of geology that advocates most of the geologic features on Earth are explainable by a [global flood](/wiki/Deluge_(mythology)). [[25]](#cite_note-NCSE_2016-25) - The [Hollow Earth](/wiki/Hollow_Earth)- a proposal that Earth is either entirely hollow or consists of hollow sections beneath the crust. Certain folklore and conspiracy theories hold this idea and suggest the existence of subterranean life. [[26]](#cite_note-Storr_2014-26) [Welteislehre](/wiki/Welteislehre), a.k.a. the World Ice Theory or Glacial Cosmogony - ice is proposed to be the basic substance of all cosmic processes and ice moons, ice planets and the \"global ether\" (also made of ice) had determined the entire development of the universe. Physics [Autodynamics](/wiki/Autodynamics)- a physics theory proposed in the 1940s that claims the equations of the Lorentz transformation are incorrectly formulated to describe relativistic effects, which would invalidate Einstein's theories of special relativity and general relativity, and Maxwell's equations. The theory is discounted by the mainstream physics community. [[27]](#cite_note-Wired-27) [E-Cat](/wiki/E-Cat)- a claimed cold fusion reactor. [[28]](#cite_note-patent_app-28) [[29]](#cite_note-zyga-29) [Einstein-Cartan-Evans theory](/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Cartan%E2%80%93Evans_theory)- a unified theory of physics proposed by Myron Wyn Evans which claims to unify general relativity, quantum mechanics and electromagnetism. [[30]](#cite_note-AIAS-30)The hypothesis was largely published in the journal Foundations of Physics Letters between 2003 and 2005; in 2008, the editor published an editorial note effectively retracting the journal's support for the hypothesis due to incorrect mathematical claims. [[31]](#cite_note-31) [Electrogravitics](/wiki/Electrogravitics)- claimed to be an unconventional type of effect or anti-gravity propulsion created by an electric field's effect on a mass. The name was coined in the 1920s by Thomas Townsend Brown, who first described the effect and spent most of his life trying to develop it and sell it as a propulsion system. Follow-ups on the claims (R. L. Talley in a 1990 U.S. Air Force study, NASA scientist Jonathan Campbell in a 2003 experiment [[32]](#cite_note-32)and [Martin Tajmar](/wiki/Martin_Tajmar)in a 2004 paper [[33]](#cite_note-33)) have found that no thrust could be observed in a vacuum, consistent with the phenomenon of ion wind. [Free energy](/wiki/Free_energy_suppression)- a class of [perpetual motion](/wiki/Perpetual_motion)that purports to create energy (violating the [first law of thermodynamics](/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics)) or extract useful work from equilibrium systems (violating the [second law of thermodynamics](/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics)). [[34]](#cite_note-34) [[35]](#cite_note-Milbank-35) [Water-fueled cars](/wiki/Water-fueled_car)- an instance of perpetual motion machines. Such devices are claimed to use water as fuel or produce fuel from water on board with no other energy input. Many such claims are part of [investment frauds](/wiki/Investment_fraud). [[36]](#cite_note-Times-36) [[37]](#cite_note-37) [[38]](#cite_note-Dingel-38) [Gasoline pill](/wiki/Gasoline_pill)or gasoline powder, to turn water into gasoline. [[39]](#cite_note-nydailynews.com_2008-39) [Hongcheng Magic Liquid](/wiki/Hongcheng_Magic_Liquid)- a scam in China in which Wang Hongcheng (Chinese: ; pinyin: W\u00e1ng H\u00f3ngch\u00e9ng), a bus driver from Harbin with no scientific education, claimed in 1983 that he could turn regular water into a fuel as flammable as petrol by simply dissolving a few drops of his liquid in it. [[40]](#cite_note-csicop_hongcheng-40) - - Hydrinos (Randell L. Mills/ [Brilliant Light Power Inc.](/wiki/Brilliant_Light_Power)) - a supposed state of the [hydrogen atom](/wiki/Hydrogen_atom)that, according to Mills, is of lower energy than [ground state](/wiki/Ground_state)and has extremely high efficiency as a fuel. [[41]](#cite_note-parkorigin-41)Critics say it lacks corroborating scientific evidence and is a relic of [cold fusion](/wiki/Cold_fusion). Critical analysis of the claims have been published in the peer reviewed journals [Physics Letters A](/wiki/Physics_Letters_A), [New Journal of Physics](/wiki/New_Journal_of_Physics), [Journal of Applied Physics](/wiki/Journal_of_Applied_Physics), and [Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics](/wiki/Journal_of_Physics_D:_Applied_Physics)stating that the proposed hydrino states are unphysical and incompatible with key equations of quantum mechanics. [[42]](#cite_note-dombey-42) [Orgone](/wiki/Orgone)- a pseudoscientific concept described as an [esoteric energy](/wiki/Energy_(esotericism))or hypothetical universal [life force](/wiki/Energy_(esotericism)), originally proposed in the 1930s. [[43]](#cite_note-43) [[44]](#cite_note-blumenfeld-44) Applied sciences Agriculture [Lysenkoism](/wiki/Lysenkoism), or Lysenko-Michurinism - was a political campaign against genetics and science-based agriculture conducted by [Trofim Lysenko](/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko), his followers and Soviet authorities. Lysenko served as the director of the Soviet Union's Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Lysenkoism began in the late 1920s and formally ended in 1964. The pseudoscientific ideas of Lysenkoism built on Lamarckian concepts of the heritability of acquired characteristics. [[45]](#cite_note-45)Lysenko's theory rejected Mendelian inheritance and the concept of the \"gene\"; it departed from Darwinian evolutionary theory by rejecting natural selection, viewing that concept as being incompatible with Marxist ideology. [[46]](#cite_note-Perversion_of_Knowledge-46) [Biodynamic agriculture](/wiki/Biodynamic_agriculture)- method of [organic farming](/wiki/Organic_farming)that treats farms as unified and individual organisms. Biodynamics uses a calendar which has been characterized as [astrological](/wiki/Astrological). The substances and composts used by biodynamicists have been described as unconventional and [homeopathic](/wiki/Homeopathy). For example, field mice are countered by deploying ashes prepared from field mice skin when Venus is in the Scorpius constellation. No difference in beneficial outcomes has been scientifically established between certified biodynamic agricultural techniques and similar organic and [integrated farming](/wiki/Integrated_farming)practices. Biodynamic agriculture lacks strong scientific evidence for its efficacy and has been labeled a [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience)because of its overreliance upon esoteric knowledge and mystical beliefs. [[47]](#cite_note-demarc-47) [GMO skepticism](/wiki/Genetically_modified_food_controversies#Health)- The belief that genetically modified foods are inherently unsafe. This contradicts the [scientific consensus](/wiki/Scientific_consensus). [[48]](#cite_note-Nicolia2013-48) [[49]](#cite_note-FAO-49) [[50]](#cite_note-Ronald2011-50) [[51]](#cite_note-Also-51) [aesthetics](/wiki/Aesthetics)based on [astronomy](/wiki/Chinese_astronomy), [geography](/wiki/Geography)and the putative flow of [qi](/wiki/Qi). Evidence for its effectiveness is based on anecdote and there is a lack of a plausible method of action; this leads to conflicting advice from different practitioners of feng shui. Feng shui practitioners use this as evidence of variations or different schools; critical analysts have described it thus: \"Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork.\" [[52]](#cite_note-duke-52) [[53]](#cite_note-53)Modern criticism differentiates between feng shui as a traditional proto-religion and the modern practice: \"A naturalistic belief, it was originally used to find an auspicious dwelling place for a shrine or a tomb. However, over the centuries it...has become distorted and degraded into a gross superstition.\" [[52]](#cite_note-duke-52) [Ley lines](/wiki/Ley_line)- proposed intentional alignment of ancient monuments and landscape features was later explained by a statistical analysis of lines that concluded: \"the density of archaeological sites in the British landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will 'clip' a number of sites.\" [[54]](#cite_note-54)Additional [New Age](/wiki/New_Age)and feng shui concepts have been proposed building on the original concept and pseudoscientific claims about energy flowing through the lines have been made. [Minimum parking requirements](/wiki/Parking_minimums_and_maximums)- system for assigning an optimal number of parking spaces to a given land use. It is characterized as a pseudoscience by UCLA planning professor [Donald Shoup](/wiki/Donald_Shoup), especially as practiced by the [Institute of Transportation Engineers](/wiki/Institute_of_Transportation_Engineers). He argues that the ITE's calculations are arcane, overly specific, and typically based on minimal data and approximations that cannot be widely applied to other businesses, even of the same type, and yet are presented as science-backed. [[55]](#cite_note-55) [[56]](#cite_note-56) [Vastu shastra](/wiki/Vastu_shastra)is the ancient Hindu system of architecture, which lays down a series of rules for building houses in relation to ambiance. [[57]](#cite_note-57)Vastu Shastra is considered pseudoscience by astronomer [Jayant Narlikar](/wiki/Jayant_Narlikar), who writes that Vastu does not have any \"logical connection\" to the environment. [[59]](#cite_note-narlikar_CUP-59) Finance [Technical analysis](/wiki/Technical_analysis)is a [security analysis](/wiki/Security_analysis)methodology for forecasting the direction of [prices](/wiki/Prices)through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. [[60]](#cite_note-Kirk-60) [Behavioral economics](/wiki/Behavioral_economics)and [quantitative analysis](/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(finance))use many of technical analysis, [[61]](#cite_note-61) [[62]](#cite_note-62) [[63]](#cite_note-MizrachWeerts2007-63) [[64]](#cite_note-64)which, being an aspect of [active management](/wiki/Active_management), stands in contradiction to much of [modern portfolio theory](/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory). The efficacy of both technical and [fundamental analysis](/wiki/Fundamental_analysis)is disputed by the [efficient-market hypothesis](/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis), which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable. [[65]](#cite_note-65)It is still considered by many academics to be [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience). [[66]](#cite_note-Paulos2003-66)Academics such as [Eugene Fama](/wiki/Eugene_Fama)say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the [weak form](/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis#Weak-form_efficiency)of the efficient-market hypothesis. [[67]](#cite_note-autogenerated1-67) [[68]](#cite_note-68) Health and medicine Pseudoscientific medical practices are often known as [quackery](/wiki/Quackery). In contrast, modern medicine is (or seeks to be) [evidence-based](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine). [Acupuncture](/wiki/Acupuncture)- use of fine needles to stimulate acupuncture points and balance the flow of qi. There is no known [anatomical](/wiki/Anatomical)or [histological](/wiki/Histological)basis for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians and acupuncture is regarded as an alternative medical procedure. [[69]](#cite_note-Barrett2007-69)Some acupuncturists regard them as functional rather than structural entities, useful in guiding evaluation and care of patients. Acupuncture has been the subject of active [scientific](/wiki/Scientific_method)research since the late 20th century and its effects and application remain controversial among medical researchers and clinicians. Some scholarly reviews conclude that acupuncture's effects are mainly attributable to the [placebo effect](/wiki/Placebo_effect)and others find likelihood of efficacy for particular conditions. [Dry needling](/wiki/Dry_needling)is the therapeutic insertion of fine needles without regard to [traditional Chinese medicine](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine)(TCM) and is similarly controversial. [[70]](#cite_note-ncbi.nlm.nih.gov-70) [[71]](#cite_note-71) [Acupressure](/wiki/Acupressure)is an alternative medicine technique similar in principle to [acupuncture](/wiki/Acupuncture). It is based on the concept of life energy, which flows through \"meridians\" in the body. In treatment, physical pressure is applied to [acupuncture points](/wiki/Acupuncture_point)with the aim of clearing blockages in these meridians. Pressure may be applied by hand, by elbow, or with various devices. Some studies have suggested it may be effective at helping manage nausea and vomiting, lower back pain, tension headaches and stomach ache, although such studies have been found to have a high likelihood of bias. [[72]](#cite_note-Lee-72)Like many alternative medicines, it may benefit from a [placebo effect](/wiki/Placebo_effect). [Quackwatch](/wiki/Quackwatch)says acupressure is a dubious practice and its practitioners use irrational methods. [[73]](#cite_note-Quackwatch-73) - [Addiction recovery 12-step models](/wiki/12_step_program), which rely on a view of addiction and alcoholism as \"spiritual diseases\" for which the only remedy (although not a cure, as this view defines addiction as chronic and incurable) is a \"spiritual conversion\" in which a person must surrender their will to a deity. [[74]](#cite_note-74) [[75]](#cite_note-75) [Adrenal fatigue](/wiki/Adrenal_fatigue)or hypoadrenia is a pseudoscientific diagnosis described as a state in which the [adrenal glands](/wiki/Adrenal_gland)are exhausted and unable to produce adequate quantities of [hormones](/wiki/Hormone), primarily the [glucocorticoid](/wiki/Glucocorticoid) [cortisol](/wiki/Cortisol), due to chronic stress or infections. [[76]](#cite_note-2012Rev-76)Adrenal fatigue should not be confused with a number of actual forms of adrenal dysfunction [Addison's disease](/wiki/Addison%27s_disease). [[77]](#cite_note-webmd-77)The term \"adrenal fatigue\", which in 1998 by James Wilson, a [chiropractor](/wiki/Chiropractic), [[78]](#cite_note-sbm-78)may be applied to a collection of mostly [nonspecific symptoms](/wiki/Nonspecific_symptoms). [[76]](#cite_note-2012Rev-76)There is no [scientific evidence](/wiki/Scientific_evidence)supporting the concept of adrenal fatigue and it is not recognized as a diagnosis by any scientific or medical community. [[76]](#cite_note-2012Rev-76) [[77]](#cite_note-webmd-77)A systematic review found no evidence for the term adrenal fatigue, confirming the consensus among endocrinological societies that it is a myth. [[79]](#cite_note-79) - The [Alexander Technique](/wiki/Alexander_Technique), named after its creator [Frederick Matthias Alexander](/wiki/Frederick_Matthias_Alexander), is an educational process that was created to retrain habitual patterns of movement and posture. Alexander believed that [poor habits in posture](/wiki/Poor_posture)and movement damaged spatial [self-awareness](/wiki/Self-awareness)as well as health and that movement efficiency could support overall physical well-being. He saw the technique as a mental training technique as well. [[80]](#cite_note-blochLP-80): 221 Alexander began developing his technique's principles in the 1890s [[81]](#cite_note-81)in an attempt to address [voice loss](/wiki/Voice_loss)during public speaking. [[80]](#cite_note-blochLP-80): 34-35 He credited his method with allowing him to pursue his passion for reciting in [Shakespearean](/wiki/Shakespearean)theater. [[82]](#cite_note-82)Some proponents of the Alexander Technique say that it addresses a variety of health conditions related to cumulative physical behaviors, but there is little evidence to support many of the claims made about the technique. [[83]](#cite_note-aus17LP-83) [[84]](#cite_note-NHSLP-84)As of 2015, there was evidence suggesting the Alexander Technique may be helpful for both long-term [back pain](/wiki/Back_pain)and long-term [neck pain](/wiki/Neck_pain)and may help people cope with [Parkinson's disease](/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease). [[84]](#cite_note-NHSLP-84)However, both [Aetna](/wiki/Aetna)and the Australian Department of Health have conducted reviews and concluded that the technique has insufficient evidence to warrant insurance coverage. [[83]](#cite_note-aus17LP-83) [Alternative cancer treatments](/wiki/Alternative_cancer_treatments)are [alternative or complementary treatments](/wiki/Alternative_medicine)for [cancer](/wiki/Cancer)that have not been approved by the government agencies responsible for the [regulation of therapeutic goods](/wiki/Regulation_of_therapeutic_goods)and have not undergone properly conducted, well-designed clinical trials. Among those that have been published, the methodology is often poor. A 2006 systematic review of 214 articles covering 198 clinical trials of alternative cancer treatments concluded that almost none conducted [dose-ranging](/wiki/Dose-ranging)studies, which are necessary to ensure that the patients are being given a useful amount of the treatment. [[85]](#cite_note-Vickers2006-85)These kinds of treatments appear and vanish frequently and have done so throughout history. [[86]](#cite_note-Cassileth1996-86) [Alternative or fringe medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine)- The terms alternative medicine, complementary medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, natural medicine, unorthodox medicine, fringe medicine, unconventional medicine and [New Age](/wiki/New_Age)medicine are used interchangeably and are almost synonymous. [[87]](#cite_note-Shapiro_08-87)Terminology shifts over time to reflect the branding of practitioners. [[88]](#cite_note-SBM-brand-88)Therapies are often [framed](/wiki/Framing_(psychology))as \"natural\" or \"holistic\", implicitly and intentionally suggesting that conventional \"artificial\" and \"narrow in scope\". [[89]](#cite_note-ConsumerHealth9th-89) [[90]](#cite_note-90) [Animal magnetism](/wiki/Animal_magnetism)- also known as was the name given by German doctor [Franz Mesmer](/wiki/Franz_Mesmer)in the 18th century to what he believed to be an invisible natural force (Lebensmagnetismus) possessed by all living things, including humans, animals and vegetables. He believed that the force could have physical effects, including healing, and he tried persistently but without success to achieve scientific recognition of his ideas. [[91]](#cite_note-wolfart-91) [Anthroposophic medicine](/wiki/Anthroposophic_medicine), or anthroposophical medicine, is a form of alternative medicine. [[92]](#cite_note-teils-92)Devised in the 1920s by [Rudolf Steiner](/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner)and [Ita Wegman](/wiki/Ita_Wegman), it based on [occult](/wiki/Occult)notions on Steiner's [spiritual philosophy](/wiki/Spiritual_philosophy), which he called [anthroposophy](/wiki/Anthroposophy). Practitioners employ a variety of treatment techniques based upon anthroposophic precepts. [[93]](#cite_note-ernstmist-93)Many drug preparations used in anthroposophic medicine are ultra-diluted substances, similar to those used in homeopathy. Some anthroposophic doctors oppose childhood vaccination and this has led to preventable outbreaks of disease. Professor of complementary medicine [Edzard Ernst](/wiki/Edzard_Ernst)and other critics have characterized anthroposophic medicine as having no basis in science, [[94]](#cite_note-mckie-94) [pseudoscientific](/wiki/Pseudoscience) [[95]](#cite_note-seop-95)and apitherapy make claims for its health benefits, which remain unsupported by [evidence-based medicine](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine). [[97]](#cite_note-acsLP-97) [[98]](#cite_note-cassLP-98) [Applied kinesiology](/wiki/Applied_kinesiology)(AK) is a technique in alternative medicine claimed to be able to diagnose illness or choose treatment by testing muscles for strength and weakness. [[99]](#cite_note-pmid11926427-99)According to their guidelines on allergy diagnostic testing, the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology stated there is \"no evidence of diagnostic validity\" of applied kinesiology. [[100]](#cite_note-pmid18431959-100)Another study has shown that as an evaluative method, AK \"is no more useful than random guessing\" [[101]](#cite_note-kenney-101)and the American Cancer Society has said that \"scientific evidence does not support the claim that applied kinesiology can diagnose or treat cancer or other illness\".

[[105]](#cite_note-105)Aromatherapists, people who specialize in the practice of aromatherapy, utilize blends of supposedly therapeutic essential oils that can be used as topical application, massage, inhalation or water immersion. There is no good [medical evidence](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine)that aromatherapy can either prevent, treat, or cure any disease. [[106]](#cite_note-106)Placebo-controlled trials are difficult to design, as the point of aromatherapy is the smell of the products. There is disputed evidence that it may be effective in combating postoperative nausea and vomiting. [[107]](#cite_note-Hines2018-107) [Auriculotherapy](/wiki/Auriculotherapy)(also auricular therapy, ear acupuncture, and auriculoacupuncture) is a form of [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine)based on the idea that the [ear](/wiki/Ear)is a micro-system which reflects the entire body, represented on the [auricle](/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)), the outer portion of the ear. Conditions affecting the physical, mental or emotional health of the patient are assumed to be treatable by stimulation of the surface of the ear exclusively. Similar mappings are used in many areas of the body, including the practices of [reflexology](/wiki/Reflexology)and [iridology](/wiki/Iridology). These mappings are not based on or supported by any medical or [scientific evidence](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine)and are therefore considered to be [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience).

[[118]](#cite_note-ayurveda_ama-118) [[119]](#cite_note-ayurveda_quackwatch-119)Imbalance or stress in an individual's consciousness is believed to be the cause of diseases. [[118]](#cite_note-ayurveda_ama-118)Patients are classified by body types (three [doshas](/wiki/Doshas), which are considered to control mind-body harmony, determine an individual's \"body type\") and treatment is aimed at restoring balance to the mind-body system. [[118]](#cite_note-ayurveda_ama-118) [[119]](#cite_note-ayurveda_quackwatch-119)It has long been the main traditional system of health care in India [[119]](#cite_note-ayurveda_quackwatch-119)and it has become institutionalized in India's colleges and schools, although unlicensed practitioners are common. [[120]](#cite_note-ayurveda_review-120)As with other traditional knowledge, much of it was lost; in the West, current practice is in part based on the teachings of the [Maharishi Mahesh Yogi](/wiki/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi)in the 1980s, [[121]](#cite_note-todd-121)who mixed it with [Transcendental Meditation](/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation); other forms of [Ayurveda](/wiki/Ayurveda)exist as well.

Many mineral waters at spas are rich in particular [minerals](/wiki/Mineral)such as [silica](/wiki/Silica), [sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur), [selenium](/wiki/Selenium)and [radium](/wiki/Radium). Scientific studies into the effectiveness of balneotherapy do not show that balneotherapy is effective for treating [rheumatoid arthritis](/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis). [[123]](#cite_note-Verhagen2015-123)There is also no evidence indicating a more effective type of bath, [[123]](#cite_note-Verhagen2015-123)or to indicate that bathing is more effective than physical exercise, [relaxation therapy](/wiki/Relaxation_therapy), or [mudpacks](/wiki/Mudpack). [[123]](#cite_note-Verhagen2015-123)Most of the studies on balneotherapy have methodological flaws and are not reliable. [[123]](#cite_note-Verhagen2015-123) [[124]](#cite_note-124)A 2009 review of all published clinical evidence concluded that existing research is not sufficiently strong to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of balneotherapy. [[125]](#cite_note-125) [Bates method](/wiki/Bates_method)- an alternative Eye-care physician [William Horatio Bates](/wiki/William_Bates_(physician))(1860-1931) attributed nearly all sight problems to [habitual](/wiki/Habit_(psychology))\"strain\" of the eyes and thus felt that relieving such \"strain\" would cure the problems. In 1952, optometry professor [Elwin Marg](/wiki/Elwin_Marg)wrote of Bates, \"Most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists.\" [[126]](#cite_note-Chou-126) [Biological terrain assessment](/wiki/Biological_terrain_assessment)- a set of computerized tests used to measure the pH, resistivity and redox of a person's urine, blood and saliva, with the intention of recommending a customized program of health supplements and remedies (such as vitamins, homeopathic supplements, or herbal medicines) based on the results. Proponents suggest that BTA allows for a correction of biological imbalances before they become pathological, while opponents claim that the tests are imprecise and result in incorrect diagnoses. [[127]](#cite_note-Quackwatch_terrain-127) [Biorhythm theory](/wiki/Biorhythm_theory)- an attempt to predict various aspects of a person's life through simple mathematical cycles. The theory was developed by [Wilhelm Fliess](/wiki/Wilhelm_Fliess)in the late 19th century and was popularized in the United States in the late 1970s. It was described as pseudoscience. [[128]](#cite_note-128) [Body memory](/wiki/Body_memory)(BM) is a [hypothesis](/wiki/Hypothesis)that the body itself is capable of storing memories, as opposed to only the brain. While experiments have demonstrated the possibility of cellular memory [[129]](#cite_note-cosier-129)there are currently no known means by which tissues other than the brain would be capable of storing memories. [[130]](#cite_note-Smith-130) [[131]](#cite_note-Lilienfeld-131)Modern usage of BM tends to frame it exclusively in the context of traumatic memory and ways in which the body responds to recall of a memory. In this regard, it has become relevant in treatment for [PTSD](/wiki/PTSD). [[132]](#cite_note-M.D.2014-132) [Brain Gym](/wiki/Brain_Gym)- is an organization promoting a series of exercises claimed to improve academic performance. Twenty-six Brain Gym activities are claimed to improve eye teaming (binocular vision), spatial and listening skills, hand-eye coordination and whole-body flexibility and by doing this manipulate the brain, improving learning and recall of information. The Brain Gym program calls for children to repeat certain simple movements such as crawling, yawning, making symbols in the air and drinking water; these are intended to \"integrate\", \"repattern\", and increase blood flow to the brain. [[133]](#cite_note-wishful2007-133) [[134]](#cite_note-Goldacre2010-134)Though the organization claims the methods are grounded in good neuroscience, the underlying ideas are pseudoscience. [[135]](#cite_note-HJ-NN2014-135) [[136]](#cite_note-TES2016-136) [Candida hypersensitivity](/wiki/Candida_hypersensitivity)- It has been spuriously claimed that chronic yeast infections are responsible for many common disorders and [non-specific symptoms](/wiki/Non-specific_symptom), including [[138]](#cite_note-Barrett2005-138)The notion has been strongly challenged by the [American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology](/wiki/American_Academy_of_Allergy,_Asthma,_and_Immunology).

[[141]](#cite_note-141) [[142]](#cite_note-Weberchel-142)While [chelation](/wiki/Chelation)is a valid form of medical treatment, used as a means to treat conditions such as acute heavy metal toxicity, [[143]](#cite_note-143)the use of chelation therapy by alternative medicine practitioners for behavioral and other disorders is considered [pseudoscientific](/wiki/Pseudoscience); there is no proof that it is effective. [[144]](#cite_note-144)In addition to being ineffective, chelation therapy prior to heavy metal testing can artificially raise urinary heavy metal concentrations (\"provoked\" urine testing) and lead to inappropriate and unnecessary treatment. [[145]](#cite_note-toxicfive-145)The [American College of Medical Toxicology](/wiki/American_College_of_Medical_Toxicology)and the [American Academy of Clinical Toxicology](/wiki/American_Academy_of_Clinical_Toxicology)warn the public that chelating agents used in chelation therapy may have serious side effects, including liver and kidney damage, blood pressure changes, allergies and, in some cases, even death of the patient. [[145]](#cite_note-toxicfive-145) [Chiropractic](/wiki/Chiropractic)is a form of [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine)mostly concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the [musculoskeletal system](/wiki/Musculoskeletal_system), especially the [spine](/wiki/Vertebral_column). [[146]](#cite_note-Chapman-Smith-146)Some proponents, especially those in the field's early history, have claimed that such disorders affect general health via the [nervous system](/wiki/Nervous_system), [[147]](#cite_note-Nelson-147)through [vertebral subluxation](/wiki/Vertebral_subluxation), other joints and [soft tissues](/wiki/Soft_tissue). [[150]](#cite_note-content-of-practice-150)Its foundation is at odds with [mainstream medicine](/wiki/Mainstream_medicine)and chiropractic is sustained by [pseudoscientific](/wiki/Pseudoscientific)ideas, such as \"innate intelligence\" that therapy, colorology or an [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine)method which is considered [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience). [[153]](#cite_note-153)Chromotherapists claim to be able to use [light](/wiki/Light)in the form of [color](/wiki/Color)to balance \"energy\" lacking from a person's body, whether it be on physical, emotional, spiritual, or mental levels. Color therapy is distinct from other types of [light therapy](/wiki/Light_therapy), such as [neonatal jaundice treatment](/wiki/Neonatal_jaundice) [[154]](#cite_note-154)and [blood irradiation therapy](/wiki/Blood_irradiation_therapy), which is a scientifically accepted medical treatment for a number of conditions, [[155]](#cite_note-ACSCT-155)and from [photobiology](/wiki/Photobiology), the scientific study of the effects of light on living organisms. French skeptic and lighting physicist S\u00e9bastien Point considers LED lamps at domestic radiance to be safe in normal use for the general population; [[156]](#cite_note-156) [[157]](#cite_note-157)he also pointed out the risk of overexposure to light from LEDs for practices like chromotherapy, when duration and time exposure are not under control.

Colon cleansing may be branded colon hydrotherapy, a colonic or colonic irrigation. During the 2000s, internet marketing and [infomercials](/wiki/Infomercial)of oral supplements supposedly for colon cleansing increased. [[163]](#cite_note-Marketplace2009-163)Some forms of [colon Hydrotherapy](/wiki/Colon_Hydrotherapy_(Colonics))use tubes to inject [water](/wiki/Water), sometimes mixed with herbs or with other liquids, into the colon via the rectum using special equipment. Oral cleaning regimens use [dietary fiber](/wiki/Dietary_fiber), herbs, [dietary supplements](/wiki/Dietary_supplement), or [laxatives](/wiki/Laxative). People who practice colon cleansing believe that accumulations of putrefied feces line the walls of the [large intestine](/wiki/Large_intestine)and that accumulations symptoms](/wiki/Nonspecific_symptom)and general ill-health. This \"auto-intoxication\" hypothesis based on medical beliefs of the [Ancient Egyptians](/wiki/Ancient_Egypt)and [Greeks](/wiki/Ancient_Greece)and was discredited in the early 20th century. [[164]](#cite_note-ACS12-164) [Colloidal silver](/wiki/Colloidal_silver)(a [colloid](/wiki/Colloid)consisting of silver particles suspended in liquid) and formulations containing silver salts were used by physicians in the early 20th century, but their use was largely discontinued in the 1940s following the development of safer and effective modern antibiotics. [[165]](#cite_note-pmid8632503CS-165) [[166]](#cite_note-mskccCS-166)Since about 1990, there has been a resurgence of the promotion of colloidal silver as a dietary supplement, [[167]](#cite_note-NCCIHsilverCS-167)marketed with claims of it being an essential mineral supplement, or that it can prevent or treat numerous diseases, such the effectiveness of colloidal silver for any of these claimed indications. [[167]](#cite_note-NCCIHsilverCS-167) [[170]](#cite_note-fda-ruleCS-170) [[171]](#cite_note-pmid11593479CS-171)Silver is not an [essential mineral](/wiki/Essential_mineral)in humans; there is no dietary requirement for silver and hence, no such thing as a silver \"deficiency\". [[167]](#cite_note-NCCIHsilverCS-167)There is no evidence that colloidal silver treats or prevents any medical condition and it can cause serious and potentially irreversible side effects, such as [argyria](/wiki/Argyria). [[167]](#cite_note-NCCIHsilverCS-167) [COVID-19 misinformation](/wiki/COVID-19_misinformation)- multiple theories proposing a wide variety of different things regarding the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), [COVID-19](/wiki/COVID-19)itself and [COVID-19 vaccines](/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine). - The a document that emerged from the [American Institute for Economic Research](/wiki/American_Institute_for_Economic_Research)during the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), authored by three scientists. It promised a way to allow people to carry on their normal lives while invoking the impossible idea of \"focused protection\" for vulnerable people. [[172]](#cite_note-sbmgbd-172)The epidemiologist [Michael Osterholm](/wiki/Michael_Osterholm)called it \"a dangerous mix of pixie dust and pseudoscience\". [[173]](#cite_note-osterholm-173) - The [Craniosacral therapy](/wiki/Craniosacral_therapy)- is a form of bodywork or alternative therapy using gentle touch to manipulate the synarthrodial joints of the cranium. A practitioner of craniosacral therapy may also apply light touches to a patient's spine and pelvis. Practitioners believe that this manipulation regulates the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and aids in \"primary respiration.\" Craniosacral therapy was developed by John Upledger, D.O. in the 1970s as an offshoot of osteopathy in the cranial field, or cranial osteopathy, which was developed in the 1930s by William Garner Sutherland. According to the American Cancer Society, although CST may relieve the symptoms of stress or tension, \"available scientific evidence does not support claims that craniosacral therapy helps in treating cancer or any other disease.\" CST has been characterized as pseudoscience and its practice has been called quackery. [[174]](#cite_note-quackcranial-174) [[175]](#cite_note-175)Cranial osteopathy has received a similar assessment, with one 1990 paper finding there was no scientific basis for any of the practitioners' claims the paper examined. [[176]](#cite_note-Ferr\u00e9_481-494-176) [Cryonics](/wiki/Cryonics)- a field of products, techniques, and beliefs supporting the idea that freezing the clinically dead at very low temperatures (typically below 196 degrees Celsius) will enable future revival or re-substantiation. These beliefs often hinge on the existence of advanced human or alien societies in the distant future that will possess as-of-yet unknown technology for the stabilization of dying cells. There is no evidence a human being can be revived after such freezing and no solid scientific evidence suggests that reanimation will be possible in the future. [[177]](#cite_note-177) [[178]](#cite_note-178) [[179]](#cite_note-179) [[180]](#cite_note-jk-180) [Crystal healing](/wiki/Crystal_healing)- belief that [crystals](/wiki/Crystals)have healing properties. Once common among pre-scientific and indigenous peoples, it enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in the 1970s with the [New Age](/wiki/New_Age)movement. There is no scientific evidence that crystal healing has any effect. [[181]](#cite_note-Regal-181) [Cupping therapy](/wiki/Cupping_therapy)is an ancient form of [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine). Cupping is used in more than 60 countries. [[182]](#cite_note-182)Its usage dates back to as far as 1550 B.C. [[183]](#cite_note-183)There are different forms of cupping; the most common are dry, wet and fire cupping. Cups are applied onto the skin and a suction is created, pulling the skin up. It is meant to increase blood flow to certain areas of the body. [[184]](#cite_note-184)Not a part of medical practice in the modern era, cupping has been characterized as a [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience). [[185]](#cite_note-Crislip2-185)There is no good evidence it has any health benefits and there are some risks of harm, especially in case of wet and fire cupping. [[186]](#cite_note-186) [Detoxification](/wiki/Detoxification_(alternative_medicine))- Detoxification in the context of [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine)consists of an approach that claims to rid the body of \"toxins\" - accumulated substances that allegedly exert undesirable effects on individual health in the short or long term. The concept has received criticism from scientists and health organizations for its unsound scientific basis and lack of evidence for the claims made. [[187]](#cite_note-2015rev12-187)The \"toxins\" usually remain undefined, with little to no evidence of toxic accumulation in the patient. The British organisation [Sense about Science](/wiki/Sense_about_Science)has described some detox diets and commercial products as \"a waste of time and money\", [[188]](#cite_note-senseaboutscience.org.uk-188)while the British Dietetic Association called the idea \"nonsense\" and a \"marketing myth\". [[189]](#cite_note-bdaa-189)In the human body, the processing of chemicals, including those considered 'toxins', is handled by a number of organs, most prominently the liver and kidneys, thus making detoxes unnecessary. [[190]](#cite_note-190) [Digit Ratio](/wiki/Digit_ratio)- calculated by dividing the length of an index finger by the ring finger of the same hand, has been proposed to correlate with various personality, sexuality, biological, psychological and physical traits/outcomes. The field has been compared to pseudoscience due to irreproducible or contradictory findings, exaggerated claims of usefulness and lack of high quality research protocols. [[191]](#cite_note-191) [[192]](#cite_note-192) [Ear candling](/wiki/Ear_candling)also called pseudoscientific [[193]](#cite_note-193) [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine)practice claimed to improve general health and well-being by lighting one end of a hollow [candle](/wiki/Candle)and placing the other end in the [ear canal](/wiki/Ear_canal). Medical research has shown that the practice is both dangerous and ineffective [[194]](#cite_note-Seely-194)and does not functionally remove [earwax](/wiki/Earwax)or [toxicants](/wiki/Toxicant), despite product design contributing to that impression. [[195]](#cite_note-MayoClinic.org-195) [Earthing therapy](/wiki/Energy_medicine#Earthing)or grounding is a therapy that is claimed to ease pain, provide a better night's sleep, and assist with symptoms of [inflammation](/wiki/Inflammation)by being in direct physical contact with the ground or a device connected to [electrical ground](/wiki/Ground_(electricity)). [[196]](#cite_note-MIT_Grounding-196)Practitioners claim that Earth has an excess of electrons which people are missing due to insulating shoes and ground cover. [[197]](#cite_note-Oschman_JACM_2007-197)Being in electrical contact with Earth is claimed to provide the body with those excess electrons, which then act as [antioxidants](/wiki/Antioxidants). A 2012 systematic review study showed inconclusive results related to methodological issues across the literature. [[198]](#cite_note-198)Subsequently, a 2017 systematic review of the benefits of spending time in forests demonstrated positive health effects, but not enough to generate clinical practice guidelines or demonstrate [causality](/wiki/Causality). [[199]](#cite_note-199) [Electrohomeopathy](/wiki/Electrohomeopathy)(or Mattei cancer cure) is a derivative of [homeopathy](/wiki/Homeopathy)invented in the 19th century by Count Cesare Mattei. The name is derived from a combination of electro (referring to an electric [bio-energy](/wiki/Energy_(esotericism))content supposedly extracted from plants and of therapeutic value, rather than [electricity](/wiki/Electricity)in its conventional sense) and homeopathy (referring to an alternative medicinal philosophy developed by [Samuel Hahnemann](/wiki/Samuel_Hahnemann)in the 18th century). Electrohomeopathy has been defined as the combination of electrical devices and homeopathy. [[200]](#cite_note-200) [Electromagnetic hypersensitivity](/wiki/Electromagnetic_hypersensitivity)(EHS) - reported sensitivity to [electric](/wiki/Electric_field)and [magnetic fields](/wiki/Magnetic_field)or [electromagnetic radiation](/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation)of various frequencies at exposure levels well below established safety standards. Symptoms are inconsistent, but can include headache, fatigue, difficulty sleeping and similar non-specific indications. [[201]](#cite_note-201)Provocation studies find that the discomfort of sufferers is unrelated to hidden sources of radiation [[202]](#cite_note-rubinetal2005-202)and \"no scientific basis currently exists for a connection between and exposure to [electromagnetic fields].\" [[203]](#cite_note-BadScience_EMF_woo-203) [[204]](#cite_note-WHO_EMF-204) [Energy medicine](/wiki/Energy_medicine), energy therapy, energy healing, vibrational medicine, psychic healing, spiritual medicine, or spiritual healing are branches of [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine)based on a [pseudoscientific](/wiki/Pseudoscience)belief that healers can channel healing [energy](/wiki/Energy_(esotericism))into a patient and effect positive results. This idea itself contains several methods: hands-on, hands-off and distant (or absent) where the patient and healer are in different locations. [[205]](#cite_note-TimesLP-205)While early reviews of the scientific literature on energy healing were equivocal and recommended further research, [[206]](#cite_note-AstinLP-206) [[207]](#cite_note-Ernst_2001_88-92-207)more recent reviews have concluded that there is no evidence supporting clinical efficiency. [[208]](#cite_note-208) [Facilitated communication](/wiki/Facilitated_communication)is a scientifically discredited technique [[209]](#cite_note-Autism_Wars-209)that attempts to aid communication by people with autism or other communication disabilities. The facilitator holds the disabled person's arm or hand during this process and attempts to help them move to type on a [keyboard](/wiki/Computer_keyboard)or other device. [[210]](#cite_note-Facilitated-210)Research indicates that the facilitator is the source of the messages obtained through FC (involving [ideomotor effect](/wiki/Ideomotor_effect)guidance of the arm of the patient by the facilitator). [[211]](#cite_note-Why_debunked_autism_treatment_fads_persist-211) [[212]](#cite_note-Ganz/Katsiyannis/Morin-212)Studies have consistently found that FC is unable to provide the correct response to even simple questions when the facilitator does not know the answers to the questions (e.g., showing the patient but not the facilitator an object).

[[387]](#cite_note-mayo-387)Its supporters describe Wilson's syndrome as a mix of common and [non-specific symptoms](/wiki/Non-specific_symptoms)which they attribute to low body temperature and impaired conversion of [thyroxine](/wiki/Thyroxine)(T4) to [triiodothyronine](/wiki/Triiodothyronine)(T3), despite normal [thyroid function tests](/wiki/Thyroid_function_test). The [American Thyroid Association](/wiki/American_Thyroid_Association)(ATA) says Wilson's syndrome is at odds with established knowledge of thyroid function, has vague diagnostic criteria and lacks supporting [scientific evidence](/wiki/Scientific_evidence).

Psychology - [Attachment therapy](/wiki/Attachment_therapy)- common name for a set of potentially fatal [[416]](#cite_note-416)clinical interventions and parenting techniques aimed at controlling aggressive, disobedient, or unaffectionate children using \"restraint and physical and psychological abuse to seek their desired results.\" [[417]](#cite_note-quackwatch_attatchment_therapy-417)(The term \"attachment therapy\" may sometimes be used loosely to refer to mainstream approaches based on attachment theory, usually outside the US where the pseudoscientific form of attachment therapy is less known.) Probably the most common form is holding therapy, in which the child is restrained by adults for the purpose of supposed cathartic release of [suppressed rage](/wiki/Catharsis)and [regression](/wiki/Age_regression_in_therapy). Perhaps the most extreme, but much less common, is \" [rebirthing](/wiki/Rebirthing_(attachment_therapy))\", in which the child is wrapped tightly in a blanket and then made to simulate emergence from a birth canal. This is done by encouraging the child to struggle and pushing and squeezing him/her to mimic contractions. [[271]](#cite_note-Shermer2002-271)Despite the practice's name, it is not based on traditional [attachment theory](/wiki/Attachment_theory)and shares no principles of mainstream developmental psychology research.

Each method involves the therapist pretending to insert a \"code\" into patients' brains that will ostensibly provoke a strong [adverse reaction](/wiki/Adverse_reaction)should it come into contact with the addictive substance. The methods use a combination of theatrics, [hypnosis](/wiki/Hypnosis), [placebos](/wiki/Placebo), and [drugs](/wiki/Drug)with temporary adverse effects to instill the erroneous beliefs. Therapists may pretend to \"code\" patients for a fixed length of time, such as five years.

[[425]](#cite_note-feske-425)It is included in several guidelines for the treatment of [post-traumatic stress disorder](/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder)(PTSD). [[426]](#cite_note-Schnyder2015-426) [[427]](#cite_note-WHO2013-427)Some clinical psychologists have argued that the eye movements do not add anything above imagery exposure and characterize its promotion and use as pseudoscience. [[428]](#cite_note-Herbert2000-428) - [Facilitated communication](/wiki/Facilitated_communication)(FC), supported typing, or hand over hand, is a scientifically discredited technique [[429]](#cite_note-Autism_WarsFC-429)that attempts to facilitate communication by people with severe educational and communication disabilities. The facilitator holds or gently touches the disabled person's arm or hand during this process and attempts to help them move to type on a special keyboard. In addition to providing physical support needed for typing or pointing, the facilitator provides verbal prompts and moral support. [[210]](#cite_note-Facilitated-210)There is widespread agreement within the scientific community and multiple disability advocacy organizations that FC is not a valid technique for authentically augmenting the communication skills of those with autism spectrum disorder. [[430]](#cite_note-Review_2018FC-430)Instead, research indicates that the facilitator is the source of most or all messages obtained through FC (involving [ideomotor effect](/wiki/Ideomotor_effect)guidance of the arm of the patient by the facilitator); [[431]](#cite_note-Why_debunked_autism_treatment_fads_persist_FC-431) [[432]](#cite_note-Ganz/Katsiyannis/MorinFC-432)thus, studies have consistently found that patients are unable to provide the correct response to even simple questions when the facilitator does not know the answers to the questions (e.g., showing the patient but not the facilitator an object) . [[213]](#cite_note-An_experimental_analysis_of_facilitated_communication-213)In addition, numerous cases have been reported by investigators in which disabled persons were assumed by facilitators to be typing a coherent message while the patient's eyes were closed or while they were looking away from or showing no particular interest in the letter board. [[433]](#cite_note-Goldacre-433) - The [Feldenkrais Method](/wiki/Feldenkrais_Method)is a type of [exercise therapy](/wiki/Exercise_therapy)devised by Israeli [Mosh\u00e9 Feldenkrais](/wiki/Mosh%C3%A9_Feldenkrais)(1904-1984) during the mid-20th century. The method is claimed to reorganize connections between the brain and body and so improve body movement and psychological state. [[434]](#cite_note-ehmLP-434)There is no good [medical evidence](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine)that the Feldenkrais method confers any health benefits. It is not known if it is safe or cost-effective, [[435]](#cite_note-aus17LP321-435)but researchers do not believe it poses serious risks. [[436]](#cite_note-CorgiLP-436) - [Graphology](/wiki/Graphology)- psychological test based on a belief that personality traits or gender unconsciously and consistently influence handwriting morphology\u2014that certain types of people exhibit certain quirks of the pen. Analysis of handwriting attributes provides no better than chance correspondence with personality, and neuroscientist [Barry Beyerstein](/wiki/Barry_Beyerstein)likened the assigned document examination](/wiki/Forensic_document_examination), which also examines handwriting. - [Hypnosis](/wiki/Hypnosis)- state of extreme relaxation and inner focus in which a person is unusually responsive to suggestions made by the hypnotist. The modern practice has its roots in the idea of [animal magnetism](/wiki/Animal_magnetism), or mesmerism, originated by [Franz Mesmer](/wiki/Franz_Mesmer). [[441]](#cite_note-Hypnosis_ACS-441)Mesmer's explanations were thoroughly discredited, and to this day there is no agreement amongst researchers whether hypnosis is a real phenomenon, or merely a form of participatory role-enactment. [[271]](#cite_note-Shermer2002-271) [[442]](#cite_note-Westen_2006-442) [[443]](#cite_note-Cathcart-443)Some aspects of suggestion have been clinically useful. [[444]](#cite_note-444) [[445]](#cite_note-Nash-445)Other claimed uses of hypnosis more clearly fall within the area of pseudoscience. Such areas include the use of hypnotic regression, including [past life regression](/wiki/Past_life_regression). [[446]](#cite_note-Hypnosis_Lynn-446) - [Hypnotherapy](/wiki/Hypnotherapy)- therapy that is undertaken with a subject in hypnosis. [[447]](#cite_note-447)Using [hypnosis](/wiki/Hypnosis)for relaxation, [mood](/wiki/Mood_(psychology))control, and other related benefits (often related to [meditation](/wiki/Meditation)) is regarded as part of standard medical treatment rather than alternative medicine, particularly for patients subjected to difficult physical emotional stress in [chemotherapy](/wiki/Chemotherapy). [[448]](#cite_note-448) - [Law of which, in [New Thought](/wiki/New_Thought)philosophy, is used to sum up the idea that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts a person brings positive or negative experiences into their life. [[449]](#cite_note-gazette-449) [Skeptical Inquirer](/wiki/Skeptical_Inquirer)magazine criticized the lack of [falsifiability](/wiki/Falsifiability)and [testability](/wiki/Testability)of these claims. [[450]](#cite_note-csicop.org-450)Critics have asserted that the evidence provided is usually [anecdotal](/wiki/Anecdotal)and that, because of the [self-selecting nature of the positive reports](/wiki/Publication_bias), as well as the [subjective](/wiki/Subjectivity)nature of any results, these reports are susceptible to [confirmation bias](/wiki/Confirmation_bias)and [selection bias](/wiki/Selection_bias). [[451]](#cite_note-Kaptchuck-451)Physicist [Ali Alousi](/w/index.php?title=Ali_Alousi&action=edit&redlink=1), for instance, criticized it as unmeasurable and questioned the likelihood that thoughts can affect anything outside the head. [[449]](#cite_note-gazette-449) - [Memetics](/wiki/Memetics)- approach to evolutionary models of cultural information transfer based on the concept that units of information, or \"memes\", have an independent existence, are self-replicating, and are subject to selective evolution through environmental forces. Starting from a proposition put forward in the writings of [Richard Dawkins](/wiki/Richard_Dawkins), it has since turned into a new area of study, one that looks at the self-replicating units of culture. It has been proposed that just as memes are analogous to genes, memetics is analogous to genetics. Memetics has been deemed a pseudoscience on several fronts. [[452]](#cite_note-Polichak-452)Its proponents' assertions have been labeled Indicator](/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator)- a [personality test](/wiki/Personality_test)composed of four categories of two types. The test has [consistent problems](/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator#Criticism)with [repeatability](/wiki/Repeatability), in addition to problems of whether or not it has exhaustive and mutually exclusive Judging/Perception. Each person is said to have one quality from each category, producing 16 unique types. The Center for Applications of Psychological Type claims that the MBTI is scientifically supported, but most of the research on it is done through its own journal, Journal of Psychological Type, raising questions of bias. [[462]](#cite_note-462)Results are said to follow the [Barnum effect](/wiki/Barnum_effect). - an approach to [communication](/wiki/Interpersonal_communication), [personal development](/wiki/Personal_development), and [psychotherapy](/wiki/Psychotherapy)created in the 1970s. The title refers to a stated connection between the neurological processes (\"neuro\"), language (\"linguistic\") and behavioral patterns that have been learned through experience (\"programming\") and can be organized to achieve specific goals in life. [[463]](#cite_note-Tosey_&_Mathison_2006-463) is unsupported by current scientific evidence, and uses incorrect and misleading terms and concepts. Reviews of empirical research on NLP indicate that NLP contains numerous factual errors, [[470]](#cite_note-Von_Bergen_1997-470) [[471]](#cite_note-Druckman_2004-471)and has failed to produce reliable results for the claims for effectiveness made by NLP's originators and proponents. [[467]](#cite_note-Witkowski_2010-467) [[472]](#cite_note-Sharpley_1987-472)According to Devilly, [[473]](#cite_note-Devilly_2005-473)NLP is no longer as prevalent as it was in the 1970s and 1980s. Criticisms go beyond the lack of empirical evidence for effectiveness; critics say that NLP exhibits pseudoscientific characteristics, [[473]](#cite_note-Devilly_2005-473)title, [[465]](#cite_note-Corballis_1999-465)concepts and terminology. [[468]](#cite_note-Stollznow-468)NLP is used as an example of pseudoscience for facilitating the teaching of scientific literacy at the professional and university level.

[[478]](#cite_note-478) - [Parapsychology](/wiki/Parapsychology)- controversial discipline that seeks to investigate the existence and causes of [psychic](/wiki/Psychic)abilities and [life after death](/wiki/Survivalism_(life_after_death))using the [scientific method](/wiki/Scientific_method). included the use [random number generators](/wiki/Random_number_generation)to test for evidence of [precognition](/wiki/Precognition)and subjects test for extrasensory perception. [[482]](#cite_note-482) - [Phrenology](/wiki/Phrenology)- now defunct system for determining personality traits by feeling bumps on the skull proposed by 18th-century physiologist [Franz Joseph Gall](/wiki/Franz_Joseph_Gall). [[271]](#cite_note-Shermer2002-271)In an early \"pseudo-science\", [Fran\u00e7ois Magendie](/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Magendie)referred to phrenology as \"a pseudo-science of the present day\". [[483]](#cite_note-Magendie1843-483)The assumption that personality can be read from bumps in the skull has since been thoroughly discredited. However, Gall's assumption that character, thoughts, and emotions are located in the brain is considered an important historical advance toward neuropsychology (see also [Localization method which measures and records several physiological indices such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while the subject is asked and answers a series of questions. The belief is that deceptive answers will produce physiological responses that can be differentiated from those associated with non-deceptive answers. Many members of the scientific community consider polygraphy to be pseudoscience. [[486]](#cite_note-council-486) [[487]](#cite_note-487)Polygraphy has little credibility among scientists. [[488]](#cite_note-488) [[489]](#cite_note-489)Despite claims of 90-95% validity by polygraph advocates, and 95-100% by businesses providing polygraph services, [[490]](#cite_note-490)critics maintain that rather than a \"test\", the method amounts to an inherently unstandardizable [interrogation](/wiki/Interrogation)technique whose accuracy cannot be established. A 1997 survey of 421 psychologists estimated the test's average accuracy at about 61%, a little better than chance. [[491]](#cite_note-usa-491)Critics also argue that, even given high estimates of the polygraph's accuracy, a significant number of subjects (e.g., 10% given a 90% accuracy) will appear to be lying, and would unfairly suffer the consequences of \"failing\" the polygraph. - [Primal therapy](/wiki/Primal_therapy)- sometimes presented as a science. [[492]](#cite_note-492)The Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology (2001) states that: \"The theoretical basis for the therapy is the supposition that prenatal experiences and birth trauma form people's primary impressions of life and that they subsequently influence the direction our lives take ... Truth be known, primal therapy cannot be defended on scientifically established principles. This is not surprising considering its questionable theoretical rationale.\" [[493]](#cite_note-Gale_Primal-493)Other sources have also questioned the scientific validity of primal therapy, some using the term \"pseudoscience\" (see [Primal therapy \u00a7 Criticism](/wiki/Primal_therapy#Criticism)). - [Psychoanalysis](/wiki/Psychoanalysis)- body of ideas developed by Austrian physician [Sigmund Freud](/wiki/Sigmund_Freud)and his followers, which is devoted to the study of human psychological functioning and behavior. Although psychoanalysis is a strong influence within [psychiatry](/wiki/Psychiatry), [[a]](#cite_note-495) [[b]](#cite_note-497)it has been controversial ever since its inception. It is considered pseudoscience by some. [[496]](#cite_note-498) [Karl Popper](/wiki/Karl_Popper)characterized it as pseudoscience [falsifiability](/wiki/Falsifiability). [[497]](#cite_note-499) [[498]](#cite_note-500) [Frank Cioffi](/wiki/Frank_Cioffi)argued that \"though Popper is correct to say that psychoanalysis is pseudoscientific and correct to say that it is unfalsifiable, he is mistaken to suggest that it is pseudoscientific because it is unfalsifiable. [...] It is when [Freud] insists that he has confirmed (not just instantiated) [his empirical theses] that he is being pseudoscientific.\" [[499]](#cite_note-501) - [Sluggish schizophrenia](/wiki/Sluggish_schizophrenia)- a diagnosis used in some Communist nations to justify the involuntary commitment of political dissidents to mental institutions. [[500]](#cite_note-502) - [Subliminal advertising](/wiki/Subliminal_stimuli#Consumption_and_television)- visual or auditory information discerned below the threshold of conscious awareness, which is claimed to have a powerful enduring effect on consuming habits. It went into disrepute in the late 1970s, [[501]](#cite_note-503)but there has been renewed research interest recently.[ [when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items)] [[271]](#cite_note-Shermer2002-271) [[442]](#cite_note-Westen_2006-442)The mainstream of accepted scientific opinion does not hold that [subliminal perception](/wiki/Subliminal_perception)has a powerful, enduring effect on human behaviour.

Night skies as far away as London were markedly brighter for several evenings. Unsupported theories regarding the event include the impact of a miniature black hole or large body of [antimatter](/wiki/Antimatter), [ball lightning](/wiki/Ball_lightning), a test by [Nikola and a [UFO](/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object)crash.

One such decoding method involves identifying \"equidistant letter sequences\" that spell out such messages. [[572]](#cite_note-574) Religious and spiritual beliefs Spiritual and religious practices and beliefs, according to astronomer [Carl Sagan](/wiki/Carl_Sagan), are normally not classified as pseudoscience. [[573]](#cite_note-sagan1996-575) However, religion can sometimes nurture pseudoscience, and \"at the extremes it is difficult to distinguish pseudoscience from rigid, doctrinaire religion\", and some religions might be confused with pseudoscience, such as traditional meditation. [[573]](#cite_note-sagan1996-575) The following religious/spiritual items have been related to or classified as pseudoscience in some way: [Affirmative prayer](/wiki/Affirmative_prayer)is a form of [prayer](/wiki/Prayer)or a [metaphysical](/wiki/Metaphysics)technique that is focused on a positive outcome, rather than a negative situation. For instance, a person who is experiencing some form of illness would focus the prayer on the desired state of perfect health and affirm this desired intention \"as if already happened\" rather than identifying the illness and then asking God for help to eliminate it. [William James](/wiki/William_James)described affirmative prayer as an element of the American metaphysical healing movement that he called the \"mind-cure\"; he described it as America's \"only decidedly original contribution to the systemic philosophy of life.\" [[574]](#cite_note-Zaleski-576)What sets affirmative prayer apart from secular [affirmations](/wiki/Affirmations_(New_Age))of the [autosuggestion](/wiki/Autosuggestion)type taught by the 19th century [self-help](/wiki/Self-help)author [\u00c9mile Cou\u00e9](/wiki/%C3%89mile_Cou%C3%A9)(whose most famous affirmation was \"Every day in every way, I am getting better and better\") is that affirmative prayer addresses the practitioner to God, the Divine, the Creative Mind, emphasizing the seemingly practical aspects of religious belief. [[575]](#cite_note-Inge-577) [Christian Science](/wiki/Christian_Science)is generally considered a [Christian](/wiki/Christianity) [new religious movement](/wiki/New_religious_movement); however, some have called it \"pseudoscience\" because its founder, [Mary Baker Eddy](/wiki/Mary_Baker_Eddy), used \"science\" in its name, and because of its former stance against medical science. Also, \"Eddy used the term Metaphysical science to distinguish her system both from materialistic science and from occult science.\" [[576]](#cite_note-578)The church now accepts the use of medical science. Vaccinations were banned, but in 1901, Eddy, at the age of 80, advised her followers to submit to them. [[577]](#cite_note-579) [Energy](/wiki/Energy_(esotericism))is used by writers and practitioners of various [esoteric](/wiki/Esoteric)forms of [spirituality](/wiki/Spirituality)and [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine)to refer to a variety of claimed experiences and phenomena that defy measurement and thus can be distinguished from the [scientific form of energy](/wiki/Energy). [[578]](#cite_note-Stengerenergy-580) [[579]](#cite_note-Smithenergy-581)There is no existence of such energy. [[578]](#cite_note-Stengerenergy-580) [[579]](#cite_note-Smithenergy-581) [[580]](#cite_note-energyenergy-582)Therapies that purport to use, modify, or manipulate unknown energies are thus among the most contentious of all complementary and [alternative medicines](/wiki/Alternative_medicine). Claims related to energy therapies are most often [anecdotal](/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence)(from single stories), rather than being based or spiritual practice of evicting [demons](/wiki/Demon)or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, that is believed to be [possessed](/wiki/Demonic_possession). Depending on the spiritual beliefs of the [exorcist](/wiki/Exorcist), this may be done by causing the entity to swear an oath, performing an elaborate [ritual](/wiki/Ritual), or simply by commanding it to depart in the name of a higher power. The practice is ancient and part of the belief system of many cultures and religions. Requested and performed exorcism began to decline in the United States by the 18th century and occurred rarely until the latter half of the 20th century, when the public saw a sharp rise due to the media attention exorcisms were getting. There was \"a 50% increase in the number of exorcisms performed between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s\". [Koranic scientific foreknowledge](/wiki/Islamic_attitudes_towards_science)(or Qur'anic science or Hadeeth science) asserts that foundational Islamic religious texts made accurate statements about the world that science verified hundreds of years later. [[583]](#cite_note-LewisHammer2011-585)This belief is a common theme in [Bucailleism](/wiki/Maurice_Bucaille#Bucailleism). [[584]](#cite_note-Kuiper_2021-586) [[585]](#cite_note-Hameed2019-587)According to Turkish American physicist [Taner Edis](/wiki/Taner_Edis), many Muslims appreciate technology and respect the role that science plays in its creation. As a result, he says there is a great deal of Islamic [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience)attempting to reconcile science with their religious beliefs. [[586]](#cite_note-Edis2009ScienceEducation-588) [[587]](#cite_note-EdisFreeInquiry-589)Edis maintains that the motivation to read modern scientific truths into holy books is also stronger for Muslims than Christians. [[588]](#cite_note-TanerEdis-590)This is because, according to Edis, true criticism of the Quran is almost non-existent in the Muslim world, causing Muslims to believe that scientific truths simply must appear in the Quran. [[588]](#cite_note-TanerEdis-590) Creation science [Creation science](/wiki/Creation_science) or scientific creationism is a branch of creationism that claims to provide scientific support for the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis and disprove or reexplain the scientific facts, theories and scientific paradigms about geology, cosmology, biological evolution, archaeology, history and linguistics. [[589]](#cite_note-591)[ [failed verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability)] called \"created kinds\" or \"baramins\" according to the account of creation in the book of Genesis and other parts of the Bible.

There have been numerous expeditions with several false claims of success; the practice is widely regarded as that \"certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.\" [[599]](#cite_note-discovery.org-601)These features include: [[486]](#cite_note-council-486) [[600]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-602) [Irreducible complexity](/wiki/Irreducible_complexity)- claim that some biological systems are too complex to have evolved from simpler systems. It is used by proponents of intelligent design to argue that evolution by [natural selection](/wiki/Natural_selection)alone is incomplete or flawed, and that some additional mechanism (an \"Intelligent Designer\") is required to explain the [[602]](#cite_note-604) [[603]](#cite_note-605) [[604]](#cite_note-606) [[605]](#cite_note-Decker-607) [Specified complexity](/wiki/Specified_complexity)- claim that when something is simultaneously complex and specified, one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause (i.e., that it was designed) rather than being the result of natural processes. [[486]](#cite_note-council-486) [[600]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-602) - Scientology [Dianetics](/wiki/Dianetics), a therapeutic technique promoted by [Scientology](/wiki/Scientology), purports to treat a hypothetical [reactive mind](/wiki/Reactive_mind). There is no scientific evidence for the existence of an actual reactive mind, [[606]](#cite_note-608)apart from [Narconon](/wiki/Narconon)and [Purification Rundown](/wiki/Purification_Rundown)are Scientology programs that purport to clean the human body of toxins and drugs respectively. Their method consists of very long saunas over many days, extremely large (possibly toxic) doses of vitamins including [niacin](/wiki/Niacin_(substance)), and Scientology 'training routines', sometimes including attempts at [telekenesis](/wiki/Telekenesis). The programs have have dismissed Narconon's educational programme as containing \"factual errors in basic concepts such as physical and mental effects, addiction and even spelling\". [[612]](#cite_note-SF_Chronicle-614)In turn, Narconon has claimed that mainstream medicine is \"biased\" against it, and that \"people who endorse so-called controlled drug use cannot be trusted to review a program advocating totally drug-free living.\" [[613]](#cite_note-615)Narconon has said that criticism of its programmes is \"bigoted\", [[614]](#cite_note-nbc_rock_center-616)and that its critics are \"in favor of drug abuse [...] they are either using drugs or selling drugs\".

[[625]](#cite_note-627) [[626]](#cite_note-628) [[627]](#cite_note-629) Idiosyncratic ideas The following concepts have only a very small number of proponents, yet have become notable: [Aquatic ape hypothesis](/wiki/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis)- the idea that certain ancestors of modern humans were more aquatic than other great apes and even many modern humans and, as such, were habitual waders, swimmers and divers. [[628]](#cite_note-hawks-630) [Lawsonomy](/wiki/Lawsonomy)- proposed philosophy and system of claims about physics made by baseball player and aviator Alfred William Lawson. [[629]](#cite_note-631) [Morphic resonance](/wiki/Morphic_resonance)- The idea put forth by [Rupert Sheldrake](/wiki/Rupert_Sheldrake)that \"natural systems, such as termite colonies, or pigeons, or orchid plants, or insulin molecules, inherit a collective memory from all previous things of their kind\". It is also claimed to be responsible for \"mysterious telepathy-type interconnections between organisms\".

[[631]](#cite_note-nye-633) [Penta Water](/wiki/Penta_Water)- claimed acoustically induced structural reorganization of liquid water into long-lived small clusters of five molecules each. Neither these clusters nor their asserted benefits to humans have been shown to exist. [[632]](#cite_note-Penta_Goldacre-634) [[633]](#cite_note-635) [Polywater](/wiki/Polywater)- hypothetical [polymerized](/wiki/Polymer)form of water proposed in the 1960s with a higher boiling point, lower freezing point, and much higher viscosity than ordinary water. It was later found not to exist, with the anomalous measurements being explained by biological contamination.

Will treatments aimed at biologic defects or abnormalities become technical steps in a program organized in a psychoanalytic framework? Will psychoanalysis serve to explain and guide supportive intervention for individuals whose lives are deformed by biologic defect and therapeutic interventions, much as it now does for patients with chronic physical illness, with the psychoanalyst on the psychiatric dialysis program? Or will we look back on the role of psychoanalysis in the treatment of the seriously mentally ill as the last and most scientifically enlightened phase of the humanistic tradition in psychiatry, a tradition that became extinct when advances in biology allowed us to cure those we had so long only comforted?\" [[495]](#cite_note-496) References - ^ [a](#cite_ref-Pollak2002_1-0) [b](#cite_ref-Pollak2002_1-1) [c](#cite_ref-Pollak2002_1-2) January 2000).

We have reviewed the scientific literature on GE crop safety for the last 10 years that catches the scientific consensus matured since GE plants became widely cultivated worldwide, and we can conclude that the scientific research conducted so far has not detected any significant hazard directly connected with the use of GM crops. The literature about Biodiversity and the GE food/feed consumption has sometimes resulted in animated debate regarding the suitability of the experimental designs, the choice of the statistical methods or the public accessibility of data. Such debate, even if positive and part of the natural process of review by the scientific community, has frequently been distorted by the media and often used politically and inappropriately in anti-GE crops campaigns.

Retrieved 30 August 2019. Currently available transgenic crops and foods derived from them have been judged safe to eat and the methods used to test their safety have been deemed appropriate. These conclusions represent the consensus of the scientific evidence surveyed by the ICSU (2003) and they are consistent with the views of the World Health Organization (WHO, 2002). These foods have been assessed for increased risks to human health by several national regulatory authorities (inter alia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and the United States) using their national food safety procedures (ICSU). To date no verifiable untoward toxic or nutritionally deleterious effects resulting from the consumption of foods derived from genetically modified crops have been discovered anywhere in the world (GM Science Review Panel). Many millions of people have consumed foods derived from GM plants - mainly maize, soybean and oilseed rape - without any observed adverse effects (ICSU). [^](#cite_ref-Ronald2011_50-0)Ronald, Pamela (1 May 2011). [\"Plant Genetics, Sustainable Agriculture and Global Food There is broad scientific consensus that genetically engineered crops currently on the market are safe to eat. After 14 years of cultivation and a cumulative total of 2 billion acres planted, no adverse health or environmental effects have resulted from commercialization of genetically engineered crops (Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources, Committee on Environmental Impacts Associated with Commercialization of Transgenic Plants, National Research Council and Division on Earth and Life Studies 2002). Both the U.S. National Research Council and the Joint Research Centre (the European Union's scientific and technical research laboratory and an integral part of the European Commission) have concluded that there is a comprehensive body of knowledge that adequately addresses the food safety issue of genetically engineered crops (Committee on Identifying and Assessing Unintended Effects of Genetically Engineered Foods on Human Health and National Research Council 2004; European Commission Joint Research Centre 2008). These and other recent reports conclude that the processes of genetic engineering and conventional breeding are no different in terms of unintended consequences to human health and the environment (European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation 2010). [\"A on the safety assessment of genetically modified plants\"](http://gaiapresse.ca/images/nouvelles/28563.pdf)(PDF). Environment International. 37 (4): 734-742. [doi](/wiki/Doi_(identifier)): [10.1016/j.envint.2011.01.003](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.envint.2011.01.003). [PMID](/wiki/PMID_(identifier)) [21296423](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21296423). In spite of this, the number of studies specifically focused on safety assessment of GM plants is still limited. However, it is important to remark that for the first time, a certain equilibrium in the number of research groups suggesting, on the basis of their studies, that a number of varieties of GM products (mainly maize and soybeans) are as safe and nutritious as the respective conventional non-GM plant, and those raising still serious concerns, was observed. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that most of the studies demonstrating that GM foods are as nutritional and safe as those obtained by conventional breeding, have been performed by biotechnology companies or associates, which are also responsible of commercializing these GM plants. Anyhow, this represents a notable advance in comparison with the lack of studies published in recent years in scientific journals by those companies. Krimsky, Sheldon (2015). \"An Illusory Consensus behind GMO Health Assessment\". Science, Technology, Values. 40 (6): 883-914. [doi](/wiki/Doi_(identifier)): [10.1177/0162243915598381](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0162243915598381). [S2CID](/wiki/S2CID_(identifier)) [40855100](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40855100). I began this article with the testimonials from respected scientists that there is literally no scientific controversy over the health effects of GMOs. My investigation into the scientific literature tells another story. And contrast: Panchin, Alexander Y.; Tuzhikov, Alexander I. (14 January 2016). \"Published GMO studies find no evidence of harm when corrected for multiple comparisons\". Critical Reviews in that a number of articles some of which have strongly and negatively influenced the public opinion on GM crops and even provoked political actions, such as GMO embargo, share common flaws in the statistical evaluation of the data. Having accounted for these flaws, we conclude that the data presented in these articles does not provide any substantial evidence of GMO harm. The presented articles suggesting possible harm of GMOs received high public attention. However, despite their claims, they actually weaken the evidence for the harm and lack of substantial equivalency of studied GMOs. We emphasize that with over 1783 published articles on GMOs over the last 10 years it is expected that some of them should have reported undesired differences between GMOs and conventional crops even if no such differences exist in reality. andYang, Y.T.; Chen, B. (2016). \"Governing GMOs in the USA: science, law and public health\". Journal of the Science of Food and 1851-1855. [Bibcode](/wiki/Bibcode_(identifier)): [2016JSFA...96.1851Y](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016JSFA...96.1851Y).

It is therefore not surprising that efforts to require labeling and to ban GMOs have been a growing political issue in the USA (citing Domingo and Bordonaba, 2011). Overall, a broad scientific consensus holds that currently marketed GM food poses no greater risk than conventional food... Major national and international science and medical associations have stated that no adverse human health effects related to GMO food have been reported or substantiated in peer-reviewed literature to date. Despite various concerns, today, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the World Health Organization, and many independent international science organizations agree that GMOs are just as safe as other foods. Compared with conventional breeding techniques, genetic engineering is far more precise and, in most cases, less likely to create an unexpected outcome. - ^ [a](#cite_ref-duke_52-0) [b](#cite_ref-duke_52-1)Dukes, Edwin Joshua (1971).

However, a dearth of studies is not the same thing as evidence which conclusively proves that NAET is either ineffective or dangerous. Organizations that do rigorous clinical trials would have little interest in studying NAET because it is non-drug based. Funding is not usually available for assessing any alternative healing modalities. Defenders of alternative and holistic healing point out that most family doctors treat patients who have a wide range of underlying emotional issues that impair the patient's health. This could happen, for example, through elevated cortisone or adrenaline levels from prolonged stress. NAET testing is carried out through [applied kinesiology](/wiki/Applied_kinesiology)while a person is holding small vials that are said to contain the energetic essences of various substances. Once the allergies are identified, treatment is carried out through stimulation of points along the spine. These vials contain substances prepared in a process similar to that of homeopathic preparation.

Those who deny that there ever was a Nazi genocide of Jews during World War II have used a similar style of arguing. Deniers have subjugated science, in this case historical science, to a political agenda, creating a pseudoscience called Holocaust Denial.... Inventing and promoting pseudoscience [the art of using \"expert witnesses\"]: Leuchter claims that the gas chamber was not really used against human beings.... Error #1: Leuchter estimates that a certain crematorium at Auschwitz could process only 156 bodies. He was apparently unaware of an SS report which confirms that the same building (which he describes) destroyed 4756 bodies in the course of a single 24 hour period. Error #2: He notes that the cyanide residue from one gas chamber wall is less than the residue from a wall inside a known delousing chamber. Leuchter claims that this is the most conclusive evidence that a \"gas chamber\" could not have been used for killing humans. His argument is based on the assumption that humans require much more cyanide than lice to die - an assumption that, as it happens, is wrong. In fact, lice require about a 50 times higher dose of cyanide gas than humans in order to die. [^](#cite_ref-Whine2008_415-0)Whine, Michael (2008).

Holocaust deniers, and the media they use, are changing as a consequence of international political developments... New forms of this propaganda encompassed pseudoscientific books and papers; crude denial material, usually published in leaflet form by small neo-Nazi groups; and what can be called political denial, which includes the most recent and increasingly potent source, namely, Islamists as well as Internet and television transmissions within some Muslim states. Many of the pseudoscientific publications available internationally were published under cover of fictitious academic publishing houses. These works included, for example, The Hoax of the Twentieth Century by Arthur Butz, Did Six Million Really Die? by Richard Harwood, and The Leuchter Report. Historians challenged these and rebutted their false theses. [^](#cite_ref-416) [Randi, James](/wiki/James_Randi)(16 July 2004).

The eugenics movement in America has impacted not only education, but also societal institutions in general. Myriad patterns of thought, policy considerations, forms of social dialogue, and multiple political, social, philosophical, and ideological trends within modern culture can be traced to the undercurrent of racialized scientism represented by eugenic ideology. Eugenics has been dangerously dismissed as an unfortunate, pseudo scientific blip in the grand expedition that is American Progress.

Three: The Ground Zero maladies are so baffling that workers will try anything. Anyone who feels better will credit any placebo at hand - whether Cruise or the Easter Bunny. In 1991, Time called Scientology's anti-drug program \"Narconon\" a \"vehicle for drawing addicts into the cult\" - which the magazine said \"invented hundreds of goods and services for which members are urged to give up 'donations' \" - such as $1,250 for advice on \"moving swiftly up the Bridge\" of enlightenment. That's New Age techno-gobbledygook for advice on buying swiftly up the Bridge of Brooklyn. Scientology fronts such as the New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project - its Web site immediately recognizable as the work of Hubbardites by its logo, which looks like the cover of a Robert Heinlein paperback from 1971 - hint that their gimmicks might possibly interest anyone dreaming of weight loss, higher I.Q. or freedom from addiction.

Narconon, a subsidiary of Scientology, and the association \"Yes to Life, No to Drugs\" have also made a specialty of the fight against drugs and treating drug addicts. [...] Drug addicts are just one of the Scientologists' targets for recruitment. The offer of care and healing through techniques derived from dianetics is only a come-on. The detoxification of the patient by means of \"dianetics purification\" is more a matter of manipulation, through the general weakening that it causes; it is a way of brainwashing the subject. Frequently convicted for illegal practice of medicine, violence, fraud and slander, the Scientologists have more and more trouble getting people to accept their techniques as effective health measures, as they like to claim. They recommend their purification processes to eliminate X-rays and nuclear radiation, and to treat goiter and warts, hypertension and psoriasis, hemorrhoids and myopia... why would anyone find that hard to swallow? Scientology has built a library of several hundreds of volumes of writings exalting the effects of purification, and its disciples spew propaganda based on irresponsible medical writings by doctors who are more interested in the support provided by Scientology than in their patients' well-being. On the other hand, responsible scientific reviews have long since \"eliminated\" dianetics and purification from the lists of therapies - relegating them to the great bazaar of medical fraud. [...] Medical charlatans do not base their claims on scientific proof but, quite to the contrary, on peremptory assertions - the kind of assertions that they challenge when they come out of the mouths of those who defend \"real\" medicine.
