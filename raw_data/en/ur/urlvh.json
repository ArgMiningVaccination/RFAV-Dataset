Featuring both quantitative and qualitative data, this report carries the voices of over 120 women and girls who have shared their stories and lived experiences to speak as the people behind the numbers. Created in partnership between the First Nations Health Authority and the Office of the Provincial Health Officer, Sacred and Strong is grounded in the First Nations perspective of wholistic wellness. It celebrates the many ways that First Nations women and girls in BC are flourishing and brings to light where systemic barriers continue to negatively impact their health and self-determination. This Technical Supplement serves as a companion to the main Sacred and Strong report published in July 2021. It includes detailed figures for quantitative data referenced throughout the main report that are not publicly available in other reports. A short statement of interpretation is presented alongside each figure to guide the reader through the data analyses. Page references linking the data analyses and the main report are also provided for each chart. Adapted text from the main report, seen in rounded text boxes, helps to ground readers in important concepts pertaining to topics covered in each chapter. Please refer to the main report for personal narratives, teachings, and other First Nations perspectives that provide important context to the data presented here. Considerations The data presented in this Technical Supplement are ordered by life phase, mirroring the structure of the Sacred and Strong report, with chapters dedicated to exploring wellness from conception through infancy, during childhood, youth, adulthood, and Elderhood. Various populations of analysis are featured in this report. Survey results and other data sources are frequently disaggregated by gender, Indigeneity (e.g., Status First Nations, self-reported Indigenous), and age group. For specific definitions of populations of analysis, please refer to the Data Sources and Methodology chapter . Chart Legend The charts in this technical supplement use the following general colour scheme throughout. Each chart indicates the specific populations represented in the chart. First Nations women and girls or Indigenous women and girls First Nations men and boys or Indigenous men and boysFirst Nations or Indigenous data that are not disaggregated by genderOther Resident women and girls or non-Indigenous women and girlsOther Resident men and boys or non-Indigenous men and boysOther Resident or non-Indigenous data that are not disaggregated by genderSacred and Strong: Technical Supplement|2data Sources and Methodology This chapter summarizes the data sources and methodology used in the charts presented in the Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement. The Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement serves as a companion to the main Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles report. It includes detailed figures for quantitative data referenced throughout the main report that are not publicly available in other reports. Data Sources Data Governance and Limitations It is imperative to honour every data point included in the Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement, as each one represents a unique individual who is a beloved member of a family, community, and a proud Nation. The First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) and the BC Office of the Provincial Health Officer are committed to upholding First Nations data governance principles and advancing First Nations' inherent right to control their own data. While self-determination of First Nations data is our ultimate goal, it should be noted that the data sets used in this report are BC-wide and not held by any one Nation, with most sources being external to the FNHA and the BC Ministry of Health. This report presents data in a distinctions-based manner by specifying whether the data are from individuals who are Status First Nations or those who identify as Indigenous. We recognize that there are limitations to the data presented in this report, one being that the data may not reflect the diversity of First Nations individuals and their social identities (such as their gender). Most of the data reflect only binary sex categories (male/female), and not a full spectrum of gender identities. In most surveys, there is no differentiation between an individual's biologically determined sex and their gender (how a person self-identifies). This report includes almost exclusively provincial-level data and, on one occasion, data by regional health authority. However, the report fails to reflect the significant diversity across the more than 200 distinct and self-determining BC First Nations communities; the differences between urban, rural, and remote communities; and the differences between individuals living on reserve compared to away-from-home. Finally, it should be noted that many of the data included in this report are dated and do not reflect the many social, cultural, economic, political, and legal changes that have occurred over the past decade. Furthermore, they do not fully account for the impacts of the ongoing public health emergencies in BC, such as the toxic drug crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Please refer to the main report\u2014Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles\u2014for further comments on the full limitations of the data for this project. 3|Sacred and Strong: Technical SupplementFirst Nations Data and Wisdom First Nations have shared knowledge and history for thousands of years through oral storytelling.b The Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement honours this established way of knowing by including the histories and lived experiences of First Nations in BC throughout this report. These voices and histories are forms of First Nations data and wisdom that are held up as equally important to the quantitative, population health data primarily presented in this technical supplement. Reviews, Surveys, and Census The Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement reports on data that have been collected and analyzed by other groups. This section summarizes these data sources and links the reader to published information on the reviews, surveys, and Census. In Plain Sight Data Report The Addressing Racism Review was an independent investigation into Indigenous-specific racism in the BC health care system, launched on July 9, 2020. The results of this investigation are presented in the report In Plain Sight: Addressing Indigenous-specific Racism and Discrimination in B.C. Health Care, released by the BC Minister of Health and Hon. Dr. M.E. Turpel-Lafond (Aki-Kwe) on November 30, 2020 (Full Report) and February 4, 2021 (Data Report). The full report and its companion data report include data collected from almost 9,000 people in BC. These reports analyze health sector data via information solicited from the Addressing Racism Review (e.g., key informant interviews, emails) as well as data from other surveys and health administrative databases. A significant portion of the quantitative data used to populate In Plain Sight was provided by the FNHA. Some of the data reported in this technical supplement are sourced from the In Plain Sight Data Report. First Nations Regional Health Survey The First Nations Regional Health Survey (RHS) is part of a national health survey conducted by and for First Nations. It captures a snapshot of the health and wellness of First Nations people living on-reserve across Canada. The FNHA is responsible for gathering and sharing the knowledge from the BC survey on behalf of First Nations in BC . This technical supplement presents data from the first three phases of the RHS (Phase 1 in 2002-03, Phase 2 in 2008-10 , and Phase 3 in 2015-17). The RHS includes questions specific to BC, many of which are analyzed and presented in this supplement. Some RHS questions had response categories with numbers too small to report in this technical supplement. These numbers were rounded; therefore, the sum of responses across all categories might not add up to 100%. b Marshall M, Marshall A, Bartlett C. Two-eyed seeing in medicine.

OWNERSHIP: A community or group owns their information collectively, like an individual owns their personal information. CONTROL: First Nations are within their rights to seek control over any aspects of research or information gathering that impacts them. ACCESS: First Nations must have access to information and data about themselves and their communities regardless of where it is held. POSSESSION : Ownership is asserted and protected by the physical control of the data. This may be implemented with stewardship agreements if physical possession is too costly or unwanted by a First Nation. - Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles (p.4) a First Nations Information Governance Centre.

In February, this survey is disseminated to kindergarten teachers who respond to the survey questions for each student in their class. The questions are focused on the following areas: physical health and well-being, language and cognitive development, social competence, emotional maturity, and communication skills and general knowledge. Together, the data collected using the Early Years Development Instrument can be strong predictors of adult health, education, and social outcomes. Participation is open to all schools in BC, including public, independent, and on-reserve schools. The data are collected in waves that aggregate results from several consecutive school years. This technical supplement reports on Wave 2 (2004-2007) through Wave 7 (2016-2019). Please refer to the Early Development Instrument Interpretation Toolkit for more information on the survey and its methods. Middle Years Development Instrument The Middle Years Development Instrument is an annual survey conducted by the HELP research network at the University of British Columbia. There are two questionnaires, one for children in grades 4-5, and another longer questionnaire for children in grades 6-8. The questions relate to five areas of development: physical health and well-being, connectedness, social and emotional development, school experiences, and use of after-school time. Participation is open to all schools in BC, including public, independent, and on-reserve schools. This technical supplement reports on surveys from the 2013/14 school year through the 2017/18 school year. At the recommendation of the HELP team, the data presented in this supplement are disaggregated by the two grade cohorts due to the unique experiences of the two cohorts across the various indicators. Please refer to A Companion Guide to the Middle Years Development Instrument (MDI) for more information on the survey and its methods. Adolescent Health Survey The BC Adolescent Health Survey (AHS) is conducted by the McCreary Centre Society every five years for youth in grades 7 to 12. The AHS reports on physical and emotional health, as well as factors that could impact youth health. The AHS is administered in public schools only and excludes, for example, schools on-reserve and independent schools. This technical supplement includes AHS data from 2003, 2008, and 2013. Canadian Census The Census Program, conducted by Statistics Canada, occurs every five years and includes the entire Canadian population: citizens, landed immigrants, as well as non-permanent residents and their households living with them in Canada. Foreign residents who are temporarily visiting or representing a foreign government are not included. The Census collects demographic, social, and economic information in two parts: a short Census survey administered to all households, and 5|Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplementa long-form survey (National Household Survey) administered to a subset of Census participants. This technical supplement reports on results from the 2016 Census and uses population data from the 2016 National Household Survey. In addition, the 2011 Census population is used as the standard population for age-standardized rates in this report, as explained in the Methodology section. BC COVID-19 Survey on Population Experiences, Action and Knowledge The BC COVID-19 Survey on Population Experiences, Action and Knowledge (SPEAK) was funded by the BCCDC Foundation for Public Health. The SPEAK data are publicly accessible in an online dashboard, and additional details are published in a technical guide . This technical supplement reports on SPEAK Round 1 only. Patient Reported Experience Measures Acute Inpatient Survey The Patient Reported Experience Measures Acute Inpatient Survey is led by the BC Office of Patient-centred Measurement, and is part of a provincial strategy to measure and improve patient experiences and outcomes. This technical supplement presents data from the 2016/17 Acute Inpatient Survey, asking whether respondents felt that their care providers were respectful of their culture and traditions during their hospital stay in acute inpatient care. Responses reported from this survey are unweighted. Administrative Health Data First Nations Client File The First Nations Client File (FNCF) is a cohort of First Nations people who (a) are BC residents; (b) have health records that could be linked through their BC Personal Health Number; and (c) are either registered under the federal Indian Act, or descendants of registered individuals determined to be eligible under the Indian Act. While the FNCF is the best available cohort of Status First Nations people living in BC, there are some limitations; specifically, the number of infants has been underrepresented in the FNCF since 2012. To conduct population data analysis for the Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement, the FNCF was linked with administrative health databases including the following: BC Client Roster, BC Perinatal Data Registry, BC Vital Statistics Agency (Births), Medical Services Plan (MSP) Database, Hospital Discharge Records / Discharge Abstract Database, and the Chronic Disease Registry. Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement|6BC Client Roster This BC Ministry of Health database is a roster of everyone who interacts with the BC health system. For this technical supplement, denominators for rates are sourced from the BC Client Roster when the numerator is based on administrative health data. The denominators are based on mid-year populations of people who live, or have lived, in BC and have registered for a Personal Health Number. Every person in the FNCF is also in the BC Client Roster. BC Perinatal Data Registry The BC Perinatal Data Registry captures data on almost all births in BC from over 60 hospitals, as well as births at home attended by registered midwives. In addition, this registry captures data on maternal postpartum readmissions up to 42 days post-delivery, as well as baby transfers and readmissions up to 28 days after birth. The registry sources data from obstetrical and neonatal medical records. This technical supplement reports from an extract of this data registry as of January 2018. BC Vital Statistics Agency, Births The BC Vital Statistics Agency registers births, marriages, deaths, and changes of name in BC. This technical supplement reports on birth data available from the Vital Statistics Agency up to December 2017, including birth weights, gestational age of baby at birth, as well as rates of pregnancies and abortions. Medical Services Plan Database This BC Ministry of Health database contains records of health services eligible to be billed to the BC Medical Services Plan (MSP). This includes all medically required services from general practitioners and specialists, as well as laboratory services and diagnostic procedures including x-rays and ultrasound examinations. Dental and oral surgery are included when performed in hospital. Some supplementary health care benefits (e.g., chiropractic, massage therapy, naturopathy, physiotherapy, non-surgical podiatry, and acupuncture services) are also provided through the MSP for specific eligibility groups. Hospital Discharge Records / Discharge Abstract Database This BC Ministry of Health database contains records of patients who are admitted to hospitals. Each record follows a patient in a facility from admission to discharge, transfer, or death. Patients who are transferred have a new record at the next facility. Records include International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 th Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) diagnosis codes that identify the causes, types, and locations of injury. Chronic Disease Registry The Chronic Disease Registry is created by the Office of the Provincial Health Officer using other BC Ministry of Health databases\u2014specifically the Discharge Abstract Database, Pharmacy Dispenses database, and MSP database\u2014to identify people living with specific chronic conditions. Membership in these registries is not based on medical diagnosis, but instead determined based on whether their use of the health care system matches the case definitions for that condition. The Chronic Disease Registry data as well as data notes are published in an online dashboard. 7|Sacred and Strong: Technical SupplementHealth Surveillance Data Human Papillomavirus Immunization The BC Centre for Disease Control and Vancouver Coastal Health Authority provide data on the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) immunization series. The Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement reports on the percentage of young women who have completed the HPV immunization series prior to their 16 th birthday. Sexually Transmitted Infections This technical supplement reports on the crude rate of sexually transmitted infections. This rate is provided by the BC Centre for Disease Control. Other BC Government Data BC Ministry of Children and Family Development The Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement reports on two datasets provided by the BC Ministry of Children and Family Development. The first dataset reports the rates of youth in custody of the Provincial Corrections system from the Ministry's Specialized Intervention and Youth Justice Branch, using data from the BC Corrections Operations Network (CORNET). The second dataset reports the rates of children in care from the Ministry's Integrated Case Management System. BC Ministry of Education This technical supplement reports on two datasets provided by the BC Ministry of Education. The first is the Eight Year Completion Rate and the second is the annual School Satisfaction Survey for years 2010/11 to 2014/15. The School Satisfaction Survey has been renamed the Student Learning Survey . BC Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Training This technical supplement reports on two datasets provided by the BC Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Training. The first dataset is the Student Transitions Project, which provides data on the paths of BC students from high school to public post-secondary school in the province. The second dataset is the Baccalaureate Graduate Survey . This survey asks graduates from baccalaureate programs about their financial, employment, and educational outcomes, as well as their evaluation of, and satisfaction with, their post-secondary education programs. Graduates are surveyed two years after graduation. This technical supplement reports on the surveys from 2014, 2015, and 2016 (for graduates completing programs in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively). BC Ministry of Public Safety and the Solicitor General and BC Corrections The BC Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General provided data on women in custody via the BC Corrections Operations Network (CORNET). This technical supplement reports on the rate of Indigenous women in custody. Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement|8Methodology Survey Data: Weighting and Percentages The Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement reports data from multiple survey sources. Unless otherwise stated in the chart notes or in this chapter, reported survey responses are weighted to align the surveyed population with the study population. Therefore, the percentages responding with a given survey answer represent the study population, not the survey population. This technical supplement also reports all response options for a survey, unless otherwise stated. Finally, in some cases, the sum of percentages across reported response options may not equal 100% due to rounding or omission of some response categories. Rates This technical supplement reports on several epidemiological rates\u2014measures of the frequency of reported events in a specific population over a specific period of time. Unless otherwise stated, this technical supplement reports rates for a given calendar or fiscal year, so rates are often represented as a number of events per number of people in the study population (e.g., \"10 per 100,000 population\"). The following describes the types of rates reported in this work. Crude Rate ( e.g., Age-specific Rate ) A crude rate is an unadjusted rate where the numerator is the number of events, and the denominator is the size of the study population. Age-specific rates are an example of crude rates reported in this technical supplement and refer to crude rates for each age group. Crude rates represent the true frequency of events in the study population and can be used to determine the burden of a disease or condition in that population. They also account for the population size. However, if two populations have different age structures, it would not be meaningful to directly compare the crude rates, as differences in rates could be a result of differences in population ages rather than in the occurrence of the disease or condition. Age-standardized Rate An age-standardized rate is a rate adjusted to account for different age structures in addition to different population sizes. The adjustment is often made so that each reported rate is aligned with the age structure of a standard population. This technical supplement reports age-standardized rates using the 2011 Canadian population as the standard population. While age -standardized rates allow for comparison of frequency between two populations adjusting for both size and age, the absolute value of these rates does not have a real-world meaning. Age-standardized rates should not be used to infer an actual burden or magnitude of event frequency . To calculate the age-standardized rate, first calculate the age-specific rates for each age group in the study population. Then, multiply these rates by the percentage of the standard population within the age group of that age-specific rate. Finally, sum these numbers. In other words, the age-standardized rate is calculated as a weighted average of the age-specific rates for the study population, where the weights are the percentage of the standard population within the age group for the corresponding age-specific rate. Prevalence Prevalence is the proportion of people within a population who are living with a specific condition. This technical supplement reports prevalence of certain conditions from the BC Chronic Disease Registry (see above). This includes age-specific prevalence of these conditions for a specified time period, as well as age-standardized prevalence of these conditions over a number of years. The latter is reported to compare the prevalence by sex and by First Nations identity. Prevalence is reported per 100 residents (i.e., a percentage). Perinatal and Infant Wellness The perinatal period is an especially important time in the lives of First Nations women, during which their communities specifically honour them for their roles as life givers and celebrate births as sacred events. Each Nation has unique teachings, knowledge, and ceremonies around pregnancy, childbirth, and mothering, which are taught to girls and young women by the matriarchs in the community. While colonialism has privileged the Western biomedical approach to pregnancy, childbirth, and mothering with the intention of extinguishing First Nations ways of knowing, First Nations women are resilient; they are both maintaining and reclaiming their traditional protocols and ceremonies. The extended support of mothers, grandmothers, and aunties promotes and protects healthy child development and ensures the strength and continuity of future generations. 1 This chapter provides detailed charts for the findings presented in the Perinatal and Infant Wellness chapter of the report, Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles. The chapter focuses on the health and wellness of First Nations women throughout their pregnancy journeys and the birth of their newborns. It considers the sacred role that mothers and other matriarchs play in passing on First Nations knowledge, ceremonies, and wisdom, and reflects on the various systems that support women during this critical time. Please refer to the main report\u2014 Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles\u2014for further interpretation of the data presented here.10|Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement HealTHY, self-determining women, infants & communiTies - Root s of wellnes s Women are revered in First Nations communities and, in some Nations, they are seen as a bridge between the Spirit World and Earth, with childbirth being a sacred occasion connecting the two.2 Connection to the land, water, and territory brings communities together to nurture the health and wellness of the expectant mother and unborn baby,3 and childbirth strengthens this connection to nature.4 The impacts of colonization, including environmental degradation and forced relocation, negatively impact First Nations women's wellness by disrupting the traditions, customs, and ceremonies which are vital for their reproductive health and self-determination. 5,6,7,8,9,10 This ability for First Nations women, mothers, and communities to pursue and participate in their own cultural practices at all points in their life, but particularly during pregnancy and childbirth, is a vital aspect of their self-determination.13 These practices and ways of knowing around life giving and childbirth are also considered fundamental to shaping the health and well- being of the community.14 - Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles (p.8) Many First Nations communities are reclaiming cultural teachings, practices, and protocols around birth, pregnancy, and mothering. There is a growing desire to bring birth closer to home where these protocols and ceremonies can be honoured.11,12 This section of Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles does not contain original chart-based data, so no charts are presented here. Please refer to the main report for more information about this topic.Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement|11 Caesarean Sections 05101520253035 Notes: World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a Caesarean section rate of 10% to 15%.

These protocols have been excluded and undermined by the Western biomedical approach that emphasizes the physical aspects of childbirth. 5 The ongoing intergenerational legacy of colonization and related policies, behaviours, and practices have resulted in frequent occurrences of anti-Indigenous racism during pregnancy and birth, which prevent many First Nations women from seeking and receiving safe prenatal and postpartum care.15,16 First Nations women have inherent rights to supportive systems, respectful relationships, and environments that prioritize culturally safe and trauma-informed care, to empower them to be self-determining when it comes to their pregnancy journeys. 17 The World Health Organization's (WHO) international recommendations for Caesarean sections consider an ideal rate to be between 10 and 15%. 18 Based on data from In Plain Sight (2020), the percentage of Status First Nations births delivered by Caesarean section in 2017/18 (23.3%) was closer to this recommendation than the percentage of Other R esident births (33.0%). First Nations communities view birth as a celebration and are reclaiming birthing practices that rely on minimal medical interventions when it is safe for the mother and baby. First Nations identity is connected to the lands and waters of a given Nation; giving birth and being born in community is central to First Nations identity and wellness.19Refer to this page in the Sacred and Strong main report.12|Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement supportive systemsPrenatal Care Notes: Data are for Status First Nations and Other Resident expectant mothers, age 10-49.

Midwives are the traditional birthing attendants in First Nations communities who assist with the physical and ceremonial aspects of childbirth throughout the perinatal and postpartum period.9,14,22,23 There has recently been a resurgence of First Nations midwives in Canada who are helping First Nations communities reclaim childbirth, and support families in bringing childbirth closer to home for rural and remote communities. 14 However, Indigenous or First Nations-specific midwifery services may not be readily available or offered across the province, and may be especially difficult to access in rural and remote communities. 23,24 Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement|14Postpartum Depression Fig 1.4 Percentage of Mothers Who Received Health Services for Postpartum Depression, Status First Nations and Other Residents, Age 10 -49, BC, 2001 to 2014 Notes: Data are for Status First Nations and Other Resident mothers, age 10-49.

To address this, First Nations communities take a wholistic approach to supporting expectant mothers by guiding them in healthy practices and grounding them in traditional teachings. 24 Pregnant women are encouraged to surround themselves with positive relationships, reconnect with their culture to find strength and resilience, and strive for balance in all aspects of life. 8 From Medical Services Plan data, the percentage of Status First Nations mothers age 10-49 who received health services for postpartum depression (PPD) remained relatively stable from 2001 (21.2%) to 2014 (20.9%). A higher percentage of Status First Nations mothers received health services for PPD, compared to Other R esident mothers, every year from 2001 to 2014. In addition to receiving medical care for PPD, First Nations mothers may also find strength and resilience in their culture, identity, and relationship with the Creator when seeking to overcome PPD . 24,25,26,2715|Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement HEALTHY BoDIES, MINDS AND SPIRITSSmoking Commercial Tobacco During Pregnancy Fig 1.5 Percentage of Expectant Mothers Who Smoked During Pregnancy, Status First Nations and Other Residents, Age 10 -49, BC, 2009 to 2015 Notes: Data are for Status First Nations and Other Resident expectant mothers, age 10-49.

For some, substance use can provide a way of coping and living with the pain, trauma, loss, and intergenerational effects that are a direct result of racism and colonial systems and practices (e.g., residential school system, Sixties Scoop). 29 Pregnancy can be a time of healing for First Nations women, and some use it as an opportunity to step away from substances and focus on other coping methods.

First Nations girls have incredible strength that has been learned and inherited from previous generations of matriarchs. Unfortunately, many continue to be subjected to emotional, physical, spiritual, and psychological traumas due to persistent settler colonial oppression and targeted anti-Indigenous racism, which is often compounded by se xism and misogyny.13 Fig 2.8 Percentage of First Nations Children Who Reported Being Bullied or Not Bullied in the Past Year, Age 5-11, by Sex, BC, 2015-17 Per cent 0102030405060 Not Bullied Bullied Notes: Data reflect First Nations children living on reserve, age 5-11.

Childhood is a formative time for First Nations girls, and it is the community's responsibility to provide them with guidance, support, and cultural practices that enable them to flourish. However , many of the anti-Indigenous, racist policies and practices that First Nations girls interact with in the education, health care, and housing systems remain deeply rooted in settler colonialism.11,12 Elders and matriarchs lead the way forward, continue to assert their inherent rights, and advocate for the dismantling of systems that undermine the health and wellness of their children, promoting supportive systems that enable First Nations girls to thrive and live up to their potential. p.3229|Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement supportive systemsAboriginal Head Start On Reserve From RHS3 (2015-17), a higher percentage of First Nations girls age 0-11 had attended\u2014at some point\u2014an Aboriginal Head Start On Reserve program, compared to First Nations boys (59.3% vs. 52.4%).

More work is needed to understand why results for school belonging are consistently lower for Indigenous girls in grade 7 than in grade 4.

The Act also establishes principles for governing child welfare to ensure that when determining the best interests of an Indigenous child, primary consideration is given to the child's physical, emotional and psychological safety, security and well-being. The Act emphasizes the need for the system to shift from apprehension to prevention, with priority given to services that promote preventative care to support families.

At the time, I didn't think it was so awesome, but now I know how valuable it is and it was teaching me respect. It's just like when I went to Wet'suwet'en culture camps, and we butchered moose meat. I remember all those teachings we learned there. The culture in my community is strong and it's definitely helped me a lot in growing up and being proud of being Wet'suwet'en. I remember there was a time when I wasn't proud and that was really hard for me to get through. I think it can be difficult for the youth still - being proud of who you are when we've received so much discrimination and racism as Indigenous people. It's a big part of your wellness, your mental wellness, to be proud of your culture and your identity.\" - Michelle Buchholz, Wet'suwet'en Nation - Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles (p.44)For school years 2013/14 through 2014/15, MDI data showed that a greater proportion of Indigenous girls in grade 4 than grade 7 reported having no physical or health condition that kept them from doing things that other kids their age do .

Since time immemorial, First Nations have recognized adolescence as a critical period of development and celebrate this transformative time through rites of passage such as coming-of-age ceremonies where Elders, matriarchs, and community members share their wisdom about adulthood. The sharing of wisdom between generations is an important process for youth to affirm their responsibilities in the community and strengthen their connection to their culture as they transition to adulthood and begin to create their own roles within their families and communities. 1 This chapter provides detailed charts for findings presented in the Youth Wellness chapter of the report, Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles. The chapter focuses on the health and wellness of young First Nations women. It considers how they establish their roles within their communities and begin to chart their own paths forward into adulthood. This chapter highlights many of the ways in which young First Nations women flourish, and the impacts of various systems needed to empower young First Nations women in BC during this time of transition.

First Nations have ceremonies and rituals that affirm women as sacred and protected but, for many Nations, these protocols have been eroded due to colonization. In Western society , Indigenous women are often blamed for the violence inflicted on them (verbal, sexual, and physical); this has created a culture of impunity around the violence. 17 First Nations are reclaiming the ceremonies, protocols, and teachings that affirm young women as sacred and respected members of their communities. 05101520253035 Non-Indigenous Male Indigenous Male Non-Indigenous Female Indigenous Female Notes: The data reflect responses from self-identied Indigenous youth and other youth age 12-18 about experiences of physical sexual harassment in the past 12 months. \"Female\" and \"Male\" reflect how youth respondents identied themselves when completing the survey.

Young First Nations women may be more likely to e xperience bullying due to colonial institutions, policies, and practices that have served to marginalize them in society. Additionally, they may experience lateral violence as a result of the traumas and violence inflicted on First Nations communities. Lateral kindness is an approach to counteract these behaviours; it aims to create an environment based on kindness and respect. 1863|Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement supportive systemsSchool Completion Rates BC Ministry of Education data showed an increase of 13.9 percentage points among young Indigenous women graduating from 2008/2009 (58.5%) to 2015/2016 (72.4%).

But for some, intergenerational trauma and socio-economic inequities related to the effects of systemic discrimination, colonization, residential schools, land appropriation, Indian hospitals, and child welfare intrusion have caused significant harms and stresses. Young women impacted by these adverse experiences either directly or indirectly face greater barriers when it comes to establishing and maintaining balance in their lives. They are also more susceptible to problems associated with their mental wellness.7 - Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles (p.65)The AHS (2013) showed that 66.0% of young Indigenous women age 12-18 reported \"good\" or \"excellent\" self-rated mental health.

Adulthood Women are respected as matriarchs in First Nations cultures and as leaders of their communities.1,2 Many Nations are traditionally matrilineal, meaning that people's identities, including their clans and roles, are passed down through their mothers.3 While many First Nations matriarchs continue to thrive and hold positions of leadership in their communities,4 the ongoing structures, policies, and attitudes of colonialism have had devastating effects on the lives, relationships, and health of many First Nations women, which have impacted the strength and balance of families and communities. 5 This chapter provides detailed charts for findings presented in the Adulthood chapter of the report, Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles. The chapter focuses on the health and wellness of First Nations women age 18-54 (and up to 65 for some data), and celebrates First Nations women's resilience and their ability to adapt and thrive amidst ongoing challenges stemming from colonial structures and systems.

As a result, many First Nations women continue to be subjected to social, economic, cultural, and political exclusion.14 First Nations women are leading the important work to decolonize the systems and institutions that create systemic barriers leading to health inequities. 4 Racism and discrimination are embedded in the everyday lives of First Nations women. In mainstream society, the values are so deeply entrenched that those holding them do not see them as discriminatory. R acism and discrimination [that] manifest at the individual level and the structural level, through systems, institutions, laws, and policies and structures as well as interpersonal relationships - result in stereotyping, marginalization, stigmatization, and violence.14 Racism compounds other forms of social exclusion based on intersections such as gender, sexual orientation, age, class and ability, causing further injustice and harm.14 The pain and trauma resulting from racism and discrimination affects First Nations women and their children and communities in countless ways.15 - Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles (p.75)p.7595|Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement 95|Sacred and Strong: Technical Supplement supportive systemsViolence and Abuse First Nations women experience disproportionate levels of violence and aggression due to historical and ongoing impacts of colonialism compounded by misogyny and racism.14 From RHS2 (2008-10) to RHS3 (2015-17), reported experiences of verbal aggression remained consistent with approximately half (50.2%) of First Nations women age 18-54 experiencing verbal aggression towards them.

Indigenous women are targeted by law enforcement and criminalized for protecting themselves, their loved ones, and their land from violence. 12 To decrease custody rates among First Nations women, there is a need for reform to non-Indigenous enforcement practices.28 In addition, there is a need for Indigenous-grounded, restorative justice programs and community-based law enforcement to restore power imbalances created by colonialism. In the 10-year span from 2006/07 to 2016/17, the rate of Indigenous women age 18 and older in provincial custody increased from 67.6 per 100,000 to 87.4 per 100,000.

It considers how older First Nations women and Elders live in wellness, connected to culture and community, and the various systems that support women into Elderhood and through the sacred end-of-life passage. Please refer to the main report\u2014Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles\u2014for further interpretation of the data presented here. Elders are the keepers of First Nations wisdom, history, and knowledge.2 As grandmothers, mothers, and aunties, older First Nations women and Elders are the trusted supports for younger generations of First Nations women, and are essential sources of wisdom and advice about healthy ways of living.3 Achieving the vision of healthy and thriving, self-determining Nations and communities supports older First Nations women and Elders in their journeys to live long, happy, and healthy lives as outlined in the teachings.4 It also involves honouring the final years and days of their journeys as they prepare to cross over to the Spirit World. - Adapted from Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles (p.92) \"Elder\" is a sacred title that one earns from their community for their depth of knowledge and understanding of First Nations teachings, practices and ceremonies and through the harmony and balance of their actions. Elders possess wisdom gained through time and life experience, but the honour is not defined by age. All older adults have important roles within First Nations communities and hold vital knowledge and experiences of resilience. However, not all older adults are Elders. - Sacred and Strong: Upholding our Matriarchal Roles (p.92)125|Sacred and Strong: Technical SupplementHealTHY, self-determining Elders & communiTies - Root s of wellness The foundational roots of health and wellness for older First Nations women and Elders are the connections and relationships they forge with land, culture, ceremony, and ancestors.
