Cell membrane coating endows nanoplatforms with prolonged blood circulation, enhanced immune escape, and improved targeting capability. However, monotypic cell membrane fails to meet the omnifarious needs of biomedical applications. The combination of different types of cell membranes provides a promising solution to provide multifunctional biomimetic nanoplatforms. In this review, we first discuss the feasibility of constructing biomimetic hybrid membranes and summarize current methods of preparing biomimetic hybrid membrane-based nanoplatforms (BHMNs) and their biomedical applications including drug delivery, cancer detection, detoxification, and cancer vaccines. Finally, the prospects and challenges of utilizing BHMNs for personalized medicine are also discussed. - This article is part of the themed "}
