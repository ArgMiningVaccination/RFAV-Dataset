He or she is most likely [exposed to a variety of harmful chemicals](https://www.epa.gov/healthresearch/understanding-exposures-childrens-environments), metals, and other toxins. As the world becomes more accustomed to pollutions, medications, vaccinations, and processed foods, your child has more unhealthy toxins in their body. However, you can clear your child's system healthily and safely using a kid's detox bath, chiropractic care, eating and drink clean, and dietary supplements when necessary. Why You Should Detox Your Child You may wonder how to detox your child without harming them. The media took the word detox and used it to advertise unhealthy crash diets thus contributing to its poor reputation. Diet culture took the concept of detoxifying your system and made it into a marketing scheme. In addition, you may also wonder why people need to detox when they have kidneys, an organ that naturally cleans our bodies. A child's [kidneys do not develop until they are 2-years-old](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/08860229909085090). Furthermore, kidneys can always use some help since the world is filled to the brim with toxins. From the food we eat to the air we breathe, we expose our children to a plethora of unnatural substances. Heavy Metal Detox Bath The best ingredient for a kid's detox bath is [magnesium](https://www.greenwaybiotech.com/blogs/personal-care-articles/how-magnesium-supports-a-healthy-detox). A common source to find magnesium is in Epsom salts. The Epsom salts release heavy metals in the body through the skin while in the bathwater. The process called reverse osmosis flushes toxins out of the body due to the salts containing sulfates. To set up this heavy metal detox bath, you use a quarter to half a cup of Epson salts. Let your child soak for about 20 minutes. The first 10 minutes will give their body time to remove the toxins. Then their body will absorb the minerals in the last ten. Kids Chiropractic Care Many believe chiropractic care is only for seniors or victims of car accidents. However, [kids' chiropractic care](/services/chiropractic-for-kids/) can make a world of difference in a child's life. Gentle adjustments help the child's cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. Before a mother delivers, an unborn baby has a whole spine and nervous system. However, during delivery, each vertebra shifts as the baby are born. In the baby's first year, their spine grows by 50 percent! Chiropractic care after birth ensures the baby's spine has a proper alignment ready for growth. Besides, spinal adjustments for young kids involve light pressure. This fingertips pressure corrects and misalignments. Moreover, adjustments restore mobility to spine joins and remove any interference in their nervous system. This allows their body to function accurately and thus develop properly. By removing nerve blockage and chiropractic adjustments, help detox your child and promote a healthier blood flow and nutrients throughout their body. Balanced Diet Kids should consume a balanced diet. Consuming nutrient-dense foods not only helps them naturally detox, but they help them grow and function. A [healthy diet plan for kids](/diet-plan-for-kids-best-food-for-childrens-growth/) is composed of macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients Macronutrients make up calories. They include proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. For example, one gram of carbs makes up four calories. The same is valid for protein. However, one gram of fat makes up nine calories, making fats caloric dense. Although some of the latest diet trends like keto include cutting carbohydrates out of your diet, carbs are your child's energy source. Furthermore, they help a child's body use the fat and protein properly for building tissues. Protein serves as the building blocks of our bodies. It helps us make bones, blood and supports producing new cells. Also, protein breaks down food to help fight infections and carry oxygen. Fats also help children's bodies grow. They also help absorb a variety of vitamins and play a role in hormone balance. You hear about fat-free foods all the time, but our bodies need fats to survive since they also insulate the body. Micronutrients Micronutrients, on the other hand, refer to the vitamins and minerals macronutrients should contain. For example, a handful of fries and a banana may include the same amount of carbohydrates. However, they contain different vitamins. It can be challenging to make sure kids get all of the nutrients they need, especially if your child is picky. A helpful way to add vitamins to their diet is by giving them a smoothie. Additionally, gummy vitamins are a quick and easy treat that most kids don't fight. However, be sure to read the back of the nutrition label for any unhealthy diet, additives, or chemicals.
