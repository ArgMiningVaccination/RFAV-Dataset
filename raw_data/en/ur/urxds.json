Supplements are exactly what they sound like - a supplement to the foundations and core of your holistic fitness routine. Supplements can help optimize an existing routine or support you when you can't exactly give 100% to your consistent health habits. Note, though, that supplements will not and cannot replace basic healthy habits. If you're sleeping 4 hours a night consistently, stressed to the 9's and eating fast food 5 times per week, no amount of Ashwaganda is going to help you feel better. Start with your basics first. Then optimize when you've got your body's basic health needs handled. Unfortunately, it doesn't feel like a quick cure and requires consistency on and patience, but when done right, supplements can give you the support you need to live your happiest and healthiest! I'm sharing my top 5 holistic health support supplements below and why I use them. This is not medical advice so please consult your primary care physician to see if these are right for you.

My Top 5 Holistic Health Supplements (1) Probiotics While some people argue that our ancestors didn't need probiotics for optimal gut health, I'd also like to note that our ancestors didn't eat food that was grown in polluted soil, they weren't exposed to environmental and lifestyle stress that we are and their food likely didn't have genetic modifications in the supply chain. The one I'm currently using and loving are these - the [Just Thrive Probiotics. ](https://bit.ly/2OOjZom) They're spore based probiotics that are proven to survive the stomach acid and deliver good gut bacteria right to where you need them. You can use code 'HOLISTICDPT' for 20% off your order of Just Thrive products. I take one per day with a meal (usually breakfast) and that's it! A good quality probiotic can help keep your gut flora optimized (often compromised with chronic stress!). Even our fave holistic nutritionist, [Yvette Styner recommends them here in our Q + A about nutrition!](https://www.holisticdpt.com/a-registered-holistic-nutritionist-weighs-in/) She recommends a minimum of 15 billion live cultures and switching your brand every time you need a new bottle. (2) Ashwaganda Ashwaganda is an adaptogenic herb I first stumbled upon by accident when I was looking for supplements to help me overcome anxiety. I bought [this stress-complex](https://amzn.to/3s8bROf) at the time and noticed an improvement in my anxiety levels after taking it consistently for a month. I realized the main ingredient in this was Ashwaganda and have used it ever since. Research supports its' use for both inflammation and helping people's resistance to stress as demonstrated in [this study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573577/) From personal experience, I do notice an overall sense of well-being when I'm taking Ashwaganda regularly. I take mine close to bedtime along with my magnesium glycinate because they are both calming supplements. (3) Magnesium Glycinate Not to be confused with the citrate version (which is good for constipation), magnesium glycinate can help the nervous system functional optimally and relax tension in troublesome areas like the jaw and upper traps. Magnesium is the main ingredient in epsom salts, which have benefits for muscle cramps and stress relief. If you're not looking to supplement with magnesium, you can also find it in spinach, nuts, mango, avocado and black beans. (4) High quality protein powder A hot debate among holistic practitioners arguing that you should be getting your protein from whole food sources. I believe that's great in theory, but in real life it's helpful to have something to help support your body, especially if you are active. If you are not plant-based I like using a whey isolate protein powder because they are generally higher quality and more bio-available than a \"whey protein\". I am a fan of [Canadian Protein](http://i.refs.cc/syoJefLd?smile_ref=eyJzbWlsZV9zb3VyY2UiOiJzbWlsZV91aSIsInNtaWxlX21lZGl1bSI6IiIsInNtaWxlX2NhbXBhaWduIjoicmVmZXJyYWxfcHJvZ3JhbSIsInNtaWxlX2N1c3RvbWVyX2lkIjo0MTI4NDE2Mzl9)'s Whey Isolate (Received 5% OFF through that link) as well as [Orgain.](https://amzn.to/3116LYn) (5) Reishi Mushroom Relatively new on my go-to supplement list, however I've been absolutely loving the ritual of this [ Reishi Cocoa Mix by Four Sigmatic ](https://amzn.to/3f1CTDw)to help support a more restful night's sleep. The benefits of Reishi include immune support, stress support, potential antioxidant and blood sugar regulation effects. All I know, is that I love hot cocoa and if it's good for me, full of organic ingredients and tastes amazing, I'm all for it! Frequently Asked Questions About Supplements Is there a good time to take my supplements? Supplements that are going to give you energy, like vitamin B12, are best taken in the morning. There are supplements that do best when taken with food (probiotics and zinc being one). I generally take my stress-support supplements, like Ashwaganda and magesium before bed time to promote relaxation). How many supplements are too many? It's best to review your regular supplements and every few months and determine if you still need them. If you've been prescribed a supplement by a healthcare provider, follow up with them before changing anything. Should I take a multivitamin? Another hot debate in the holistic health world. Multivitamins often have small amounts of many different vitamins. There may be a greater chance of exceeding the upper limit of any separate vitamin you're taking if you couple that with a multivitamin. I like to simplify as much as possible and so for myself, I'd rather take more potent forms of vitamins I definitely need over smaller amounts of redundant ones in a multivitamin. I keep forgetting to take my vitamins, will they still work? Consistency is definitely key with taking any supplement. Taking them daily will give your body the best chance of utilizing the vitamin and processing it for body functions it needs. Often times, it takes a longer period of consistently taking vitamins, like 4-6 weeks, before noticing an improvement in what you're looking to achieve. *TIP* Set a reminder on your phone or have your AM and PM vitamin bottles lined up somewhere you look every single day to remind yourself to take them. You can buy all the best supplements but if you don't take them, they probably won't do anything! Happy Supplementing! Supplements are a useful tool for optimizing your body and giving yourself a little extra support when needed, but like I mentioned before, you can't out-supplement poor lifestyle habits.
