The Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology has teaching responsibilities to medical, biomedicine and science students and has very active research programs and expertise that that underpin our key themes of molecular understanding of disease, translational research, drug discovery and development. Our department houses 30+ research groups working in the areas of biophysics, cell biology, chemical biology, pharmacology, computational biology, drug design, immunology, metabolism, proteomics and structural biology. Disease focus includes infection, cancer, neurodegeneration, inflammatory autoimmune diseases and genetic diseases. We place a strong emphasis on research and research training with over 75 graduate research students currently enrolled. The Department is situated within the University of Melbourne's Parkville Biomedical Precinct, one of the largest biomedical research precincts in the world that is home to several research institutes that are household names. Laboratories in our department are located both in the Medical Building in the north of the precinct and in the Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, a multidisciplinary research centre specialising in biochemistry, chemistry, genetics, neuroscience, environmental science, dentistry and engineering. In addition to housing the research facilities of CSL, Australia's largest pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, the Bio21 Institute also hosts the Universities major technology platforms including the Melbourne Advanced Microscopy Facility, the Magnetic Resonance Facility, the Melbourne Mass spectrometry and Proteomics Facility, Metabolomics Australia, the Macromolecular Interactions Facility, a peptide synthesis facility, as well as High Performance Computing and facilities for animal models. The department and the Bio21 Institute provide outstanding career opportunities for staff and superb training facilities and environment for our students.It is a great pleasure to introduce you to the research projects that are on offer by the Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology for 2022. Most projects offered will be in our departmental laboratories on the 8th and 9th floors of the Medical Building and in the Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute. The remainder will be conducted in affiliated research institutes with external supervisors and co-supervision by Department staff. The Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology Honours and Masters courses are directed at students with above average academic ability. Both courses aim to transition students from formal lectures and teaching, to self-directed learning and exploration of your own scientific problem. We will introduce you to skills in communication, data analysis and assessment of scientific papers. Your supervisor and their laboratory staff will guide you through the challenges, strengthen your technical skills and introduce you to the excitement of research - its rewards and its disappointments. You will have the opportunity to use the latest in equipment and work alongside other researchers to expand biomedical knowledge. The Honours and Masters \"Experience\" will require self- motivation and discipline, and you will learn a lot about your own problem-solving ability. Research Higher Degrees such as a PhD are longer courses with a focus on self-directed research. Graduate researchers are typically students with both an above average academic ability and a desire to further develop a specific field of research. Entry into these programs requires completion of an Honours or Masters degree. It is not a simple task to select a project, laboratory and supervisor. We suggest you talk to several potential supervisors, as well as to their current Honours, Masters or Graduate Researchers, to gain some appreciation of the research problems being addressed and the related techniques. You will find them friendly and welcoming! We hope you will join us in The Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology for a 2022 Honours, Masters, or PhD project. 2 DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY & PHARMACOLOGY 20223 2022 DEPARTMENT OF IS HONOURS?

The lab uses these to drive improvements in and personalisation of patient treatment, and to guide drug discovery. PROJECT: TREATING THE PERSON NOT THE DISEASE We have developed a range of computational tools to deconvolute the molecular mechanisms of a mutation giving rise to different phenotypes. In collaboration with clinical partners we have shown that even though patients may present the same disease, they may arise from many different mutations that alter a patient's outcome or how they may respond to a particular treatment. By analysing these mutations and predicting their effects on protein structure and function we are trying to revolutionise treatment strategies, an important step towards personalised medicine. We are currently working on a range of diseases including genetic diseases (Alkaptonuria, Urea cycle disorders, VHL), cancer (renal carcinomas), and drug/vaccine resistance (TB, cancer, malaria, HIV, influenza). These projects combine both computational (bioinformatics) and experimental (protein expression, biophysics, structural biology) approaches to unravel the molecular mechanisms driving these mutations and derive novel predictive methods. This information is then used to help identify and guide the development of novel therapies to treat these conditions. One of the ultimate goals of these projects will be the development of webservers enabling the rapid analysis of mutations to help guide clinical decisions. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: A/Prof David Ascher PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: FINDING CLARITY WITHIN A BLIZZARD- GUIDING THE SOLUTION OF CRYO-EM STRUCTURES The recent explosion in the power of cryo- electron microscopy has revolutionised the structural biology field, especially the characterisation of large protein complexes. This is helping us tackle very important biological problems in a way that they could never before. There are, however, inherent limitations that not only pose difficulties to the structure solving stage, i.e., properly positioning a protein chain within an electron density map, but also potentially introducing errors that might be propagated to the refined structure. This is especially relevant for medium resolution structures (4-8 \u00c5). The problem is analogous to looking through blurry (or drunk) glasses and, without good points of reference, not being able to orientate yourself. To improve this procedure, we can leverage the power of our existing structural and evolutionary knowledge accumulated over decades and deposited in structural databases in order to help guide the proposal of a more effective methods for this molecule placement. This project will use structural bioinformatics and machine learning to develop novel computational tools to aid cryo-EM and low-resolution crystal structure solving, analysing protein residue environments, protein interaction interfaces, and protein functional sites. These methods will be brought together into an integrated platform for the evaluation and validation of medium resolution protein structures. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: A/Prof David Ascher PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: SMALL MOLECULES FOR BIG TARGETS- TARGETING PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS WITH FRAGMENTS Most proteins work within a network of interactions with other proteins, and the ability to selectively target specific interactions, modulating protein function and providing the opportunity to develop more selective and effective drugs. But while drugs are usually around 100 \u00c52, proteins interact tightly using way larger protein-protein interfaces, ranging from 1000-6000 \u00c52. This raises the challenge of how we can use a small molecule to affect an interface many times larger, which until recently was considered to be flat and undruggable. We and others have had success using fragment-based drug discovery to identify novel protein-protein interaction modulators. This allows us to take advantage of hot-spots within the protein interfaces that mediate a large proportion of the binding energy, growing the molecule to improve binding affinity and drug like properties. The crystal structures of many protein interface modulators with their targets have been solved, which opens up the possibility for us to ask: what are the major components of binding affinity? and can we use this information to predict fragments likely to bind to a given interface? Using structural bioinformatics and machine learning, these questions will be answered, leading to the development of novel programs. The students will then also have the opportunity to test these experiments in the lab, using biophysical and structural approaches to test fragment binding.

We are interested in understanding the reasons why lung disease becomes chronic and resists the normal processes that help resolve tissue damage, as well as why the damaged lung is so susceptible to subsequent infections. Our research also focuses on developing and testing experimental medicines in preclinical models. We work with leading clinicians/researchers at the RMH and internationally to translate our basic findings into useful medicines.PROJECT: UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF THE MICROBIOME IN LUNG VIRAL INFECTIONS This project addresses a major but much under-appreciated problem- vaccinations do not work well in patients suffering Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). COPD afflicts 1 in 20 Australian and is the 5th leading cause of death (AIHW 2019). Globally COPD afflicts more than 300 million people and is the third leading cause of death. An overwhelming proportion of disease burden is due to infection. It is now clear that there is a strong reciprocal association between gut health and distal diseases, and that the manipulation of the gut microbiome and its subsequent metabolite production affects immunity and disease outcomes, including altering vaccine potency. Diet, antibiotic exposure, and smoking are the main factors affecting microbiota composition. The aim here is to determine how diet can alter the gut microbiome, and how this affects immune responses to a flu vaccine. Antibody production, critical early gene expression and alterations in flu specific immune cell responses will be examined.

Pulmonary fibrosis is severe untreatable feature of some acute and chronic lung diseases, it has recently been recognised as a consequence of severe COVID-19-induced pneumonia. Fibrosis is essentially scar tissue that replaces functional lung tissue and is a feature of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) where it is progressive in nature and always causes the demise of the patient. Fibrosis is also observed in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) where it develops rapidly, does not usually progress but can leave patients with permanent lung damage and lifelong reduced physical capacity. The current pre-clinical models of pulmonary fibrosis have a poor record in translating successful treatments from the laboratory to clinic, in part, due to their inability to mimic molecular or cellular mechanisms that occur during tobacco smoking, viral infections and the development of fibrotic lung diseases such as IPF. We are interested in developing pre-clinical models that better represent these molecular and cellular mechanisms to improve and develop fibrosis treatments that will be successful in the laboratory and the clinic.The aim of this project is to combine 'wet lab' methods with machine learning to improve the characterisation and quantification of fibrosis in mouse models with real world relevance to IPF and ARDS. You will use a number of laboratory techniques including in vivo disease modelling, tissue culture, QPCR, western blotting and FACs as well as machine learning methodologies using the facilities located within the Biological Optical Microscopy Platform (BOMP).

He works closely with a number of pharmaceutical companies interested in the clinical development of drugs targeting receptors for peptides of the relaxin family. Projects are available on multiple therapeutically relevant GPCR targets with training in various techniques including peptide mimetic design, cell signalling assays, molecular pharmacology, structural biology structure-based drug design.PROJECT: TARGETING PEPTIDE G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS (GPCRS) FOR NOVEL DRUG DEVELOPMENT The largest single class of drug targets is the G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) family, which were targets for ~30% of prescription drugs sold in the USA in 2010. However current drugs only target a small proportion of the GPCR family and peptide GPCRs, although showing great potential as targets for treating many diseases, are poorly targeted with drugs. Modern GPCR drug development is encumbered by a lack of information about the molecular structure underlying GPCR function and the reliance on cell-based assays that are prone to false positives in drug screening. While the past 10 years have seen advances in our knowledge of GPCR structures peptide GPCRs, especially those with large structured ectodomains (ECDs), remain poorly understood. This is mainly because the flexibility of linkers joining the ECDs to the transmembrane domains (TMDs) impedes crystallization. Hence the study of complex peptide receptors requires different approaches. Our laboratory targets peptide GPCRs for drug development utilizing state-of- the-art molecular pharmacology, biochemical and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. These techniques enable us to map the native peptide binding sites of these receptors and determine the mechanisms of receptor activation as well their cell signalling characteristics. A complete understanding of the mechanism of ligand binding and activation is required to design drugs targeting these receptors. Furthermore, we are utilizing novel protein engineering techniques that enable these normally highly unstable proteins to be produced and purified for structural studies using advanced protein NMR techniques, crystallography and Cryo-EM (also see projects from Dr Daniel Scott, A/Prof Paul Gooley). Our studies are complemented by peptide drug development projects and small molecule screening projects with collaborators. Additionally, we are working with pharmaceutical industry partners (eg. Takeda and Novartis) to facilitate drug development efforts. Projects are available on multiple GPCR targets with training in various techniques as outlined above. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Prof Ross Bathgate PROJECT CO-SUPERVISORS: A/Prof Daniel Scott, Prof Paul Gooley, A/Prof Mike Griffin PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursBATHGATE GROUP Drug Design Structural BiologyCell signalling 11 2022 DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY & PHARMACOLOGYPROJECT: PEPTIDOMIMETIC DRUG DESIGN TARGETING G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS Currently available drugs in the market fall broadly into two categories. There are 'small molecule' drugs (molecular weight of <500 Da) with oral bioavailability and much larger 'biologics' (molecular weight of typically >5000 Da) with no oral bioavailability. Due to their small size, small molecule drugs often suffer from reduced target specificity and toxicity. Large biologics, on the other hand, are highly target-specific and thus less toxic than small molecules. Therefore, the compounds that fit between these two molecular weights (500 Da-5000 Da) and possess the advantages of both the small molecule (e.g. bioavailability and stability) and larger biologics (e.g. highly target specific) are of great interest. Peptidomimetics are such compounds that fall into this category. Relaxin family peptides have complex-two chain and three disulfide bonded structure and our laboratory has recently developed peptidomimetics of human relaxin 2 (B7-33), relaxin 3 (stapled peptide), and insulin-like peptide 5 (analogue 13). Projects are available to further develop these peptidomimetic ligands as molecular probes and drug leads that target their GPCR targets, relaxin family peptide (RXFP) receptors RXFP1, RXFP3 and RXFP4. These receptors are potential drug targets for cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders and gut dysfunction, respectively. Our laboratory utilizes multidisciplinary cutting-edge technologies including modern solid phase peptide synthesis, molecular pharmacology, and animal physiology to carry out these projects. Importantly, we are working with pharmaceutical industry partners (eg. Takeda and Novartis) to develop peptidomimetics therapeutically. Projects are available on multiple additional GPCR targets with training in various techniques as outlined above. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Prof Ross Bathgate PROJECT CO SUPERVISOR A/Prof Akhter Hossain, Dr Susan Northfield PROJECT AVAILABILITY: Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: DRUG DISCOVERY: INVESTIGATION OF SIGNALLING BY GPCRS USING NOVEL CELLULAR BIOSENSORS GPCRs are the targets for ~30% of all currently used therapeutic drugs. It is critical to understand how these receptors are activated, how they alter cellular function, how such responses are switched off, and how other cellular components can modulate their activity. GPCRs interact with a range of other proteins and these interactions govern their function and modulation. Our laboratory has a range of advanced cutting- edge technologies available for the study of GPCRs allowing interacting partners and signalling profiles to be determined. These include novel Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Techniques (BRET)-based biosensors. BRET is a technology that places light- emitting labels on proteins, enabling their interactions to be examined in living cells, and is uniquely suited to the study of integral membrane proteins such as GPCRs (Figure). BRET-based biosensors allow us to closely monitor intermolecular signalling in diverse cellular compartments in real time. This project will examine a range of GPCR signalling pathway with a particular focus on the effect of diverse drugs. A complete understanding of the mechanisms of GPCR activation and signalling complexity is crucially important for drug development targeting these receptors. We work with multiple GPCR targets and collaborate with pharmaceutical industry partners including Novartis and Takeda. Projects are available on multiple GPCR targets with training in molecular and cell biology and numerous BRET techniques to study GPCR interactions and cellular signalling. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Prof Ross Bathgate PROJECT CO-SUPERVISORS: Dr Martina Kocan PROJECT AVAILABILITY: Master of science Honours 12 DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY & PHARMACOLOGY 2022In the Cox laboratory, we use zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model system to study pathways that regulate liver growth during development, regeneration and cancer. Our lab is especially interested in understanding the mechanisms by which metabolism is reprogrammed in cancer. We employ a wide range of techniques including multiphoton microscopy, metabolomics and transcriptomics in zebrafish models of liver regeneration and cancer. Our ultimate goal is to identify critical metabolic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for the development of therapies to combat cancer.PROJECT: FISHING FOR METABOLIC CLUES: ROLE OF THE HIPPO/YAP PATHWAY IN REPROGRAMMING METABOLISM IN LIVER CANCER. The Hippo/Yap pathway is an evolutionarily conserved cascade that plays a fundamental role in governing organ size control, stem cell homeostasis and cancer. The Hippo/ Yap pathway is regulated by a range of environmental cues including nutrient status. Although many of the inputs into the Hippo pathway have been identified, less is known about the Yap target genes responsible for tissue growth. Using a combination of metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches in zebrafish, we have discovered that reprograms glutamine metabolism in vivo to stimulate nucleotide biosynthesis and fuel premalignant liver growth. Building on this initial investigation, we currently have research projects that aim to 1) Examine how Yap coordinates nutrient sensing to metabolic output in the liver. 2) Elucidate the mechanisms by which Yap reprograms metabolism to fuel liver growth in the context of regeneration and cancer. The students will use a combination of innovative biochemical, genetic and imaging approaches in zebrafish to identify the metabolic dependencies of tissue growth during regeneration and cancer. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr Andrew Cox PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: METABOLIC REWIRING IN LIVER CANCER: ROLE OF OXIDATIVE STRESS AND THE NRF2 PATHWAY . Many of the major risks factors for developing liver cancer such as alcohol, obesity, smoking and toxin exposure share in common a role for oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a transcription factor activated by oxidative stress that orchestrates an adaptive response remodeling metabolism and promoting cytoprotection. Recent studies have identified that the Nrf2 pathway is frequently mutated in liver cancer (~12% tumors), causing activation of the pathway in the absence of oxidative stress. We have used transcriptomic and metabolic profiling in Nrf2-/- zebrafish to examine the role Nrf2 plays in remodeling metabolism during liver development and regeneration. Building on these preliminary studies, we currently have research projects that aim to 1) Generate a gain of function Nrf2 mutant (Nrf2D29H), frequently recovered in cancer, and characterize the effect the mutation has on metabolic reprogramming. 2) Examine how deregulation of Nrf2 remodels metabolism to stimulate liver tumorigenesis. The students will use a combination of innovative biochemical, genetic and imaging approaches in zebrafish to identify the metabolic dependencies of tissue growth in liver regeneration and cancer.

The Neuropharmacology laboratory looks to understand how fundamental cellular signalling pathways can predispose the brain to exacerbated neurotrauma or neuropathology. In understanding how these pathways contribute to neural dysfunction we may be able to identify novel therapeutics that can be used to combat traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.PROJECT: INNATE IMMUNITY , NEUROINFLAMMATION AND CHRONIC NEURODEGENERATION - A FOCUS ON ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE A major new area of research in our laboratory is the role that the innate immune system plays in the progression of chronic neuronal pathology. It is now appreciated that the central nervous system (CNS) does exhibit features of inflammation, and in response to injury, infection or disease, resident CNS cells generate inflammatory mediators, including proinflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins, free radicals and complement, which in turn induce chemokines and adhesion molecules, recruit immune cells, and activate glial cells. Activation of the innate immune system is an important component of this inflammatory response. We have discovered that neuroinflammation is mediated by the generation of type-I interferons. Type-I interferons are the master regulators of the neuroinflammatory response seen in Alzheimer's disease. The molecular mechanisms that are influenced by the type-I interferon signalling comprises new targets for therapeutic intervention into acute neurological conditions such as stroke and neurotrauma and chronic neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Skill acquisition: In vivo disease models, histology, immunohistochemistry, morphometry, quantitative PCR, FACS analysis of cell populations, cell and tissue culture, ELISA, molecular biology and western blotting. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Professor Peter Crack PROJECT CO-SUPERVISOR: Dr Juliet Taylor PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Honours Master of Biomedical sciencePROJECT: UNDERSTANDING TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents the major cause of death in young individuals in industrialised countries. Despite the improvement of neurosurgical procedures as well as critical care management, morbidity and mortality are still high and approximately 25% of these patients remain with permanent disabilities becoming a familiar, social and economic burden for society. A better understanding of events occurring in the brain after traumatic brain injury is essential to identify ways to limit the damage and ultimately improve the outcome. This project will focus on the role that neuroinflammation plays in the progression of neural injury after TBI. By altering the pathways that control neuroinflammation by either molecular or therapeutic means we are able to influence the outcome after TBI.

Despite the improvement of neurosurgical procedures as well as critical care management, morbidity and mortality are still high and approximately 25% of these patients remain with permanent disabilities becoming a familiar, social and economic burden for society. There are no treatments available for traumatic brain injury. We are investigating the use of biomaterials to re-direct the brain's endogenous neural stem cells to facilitate neural repair after TBI. This project will determine whether reconstructing functional neural circuitry via cell-based therapies represents a viable, alternative therapeutic strategy to improve clinical outcome.

PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Professor Peter Crack PROJECT CO-SUPERVISOR: Dr Juliet Taylor PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Honours Master of Biomedical sciencePROJECT: THE ROLE OF NEUROINFLAMMATION IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease that is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, primarily in the substantia nigra. The loss of these neurons leads to a motor handicap, associated depression, pain and general decreased quality of life. The mechanism for the loss of the dopaminergic neurons is unknown although it is hypothesised that protein mis-folding, oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation may contribute to the cell death. We hypothesise that the neuroinflammatory response triggers deleterious events (e.g., oxidative stress and cytokine-receptor-mediated apoptosis), potentiating dopaminergic cell death and contributing to disease progression. This project proposes to study the molecular and cellular events associated with neuro-inflammation in an animal model of PD with a focus on the involvement of neuro-inflammation in the progression of PD. There is a growing body evidence that the gut plays a role in PD. This project will investigate this hypothesis using a combination of gut organoids and gut motility assays. A multi-disciplinary approach using an alpha-synuclein in vivo mouse model of PD coupled with in vitro studies to investigate the specific molecular pathways involved will investigate the role that neuro-inflammation plays in the progression of PD. Skill acquisition: The techniques involved in this project entail a mouse model of PD, immunohistochemistry, primary neural cell culture, ELISA, QPCR analysis, siRNA and western analysis and data analysis.

Microglial activation has been shown to be involved in synapse formation and maintenance. Recent studies have suggested that neuro-inflammation plays a growing role in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous work from our laboratory highlights that the type-I interferon (IFN) system is a master regulator of neuroinflammation in both acute and chronic neuropathology. This project will utilise a well-established genetic mouse model of autism and investigate if there is any attributable effect to type-I IFN signalling in the progression of the autism like phenotype in this mouse.

The emerging field of bioinformatics will be used to identify proteins and signal transduction pathways that contribute to the production of neuroinflammation. This project be largely in silico based and will utilize the skills that are provided by the core bioinformatics facility located in the Melbourne Brain Centre under the guidance of Dr Victoria Perreau.

PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr Peter Crack PROJECT CO-SUPERVISORS: Dr Graham Mackay PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Honours Master of Biomedical science 16 DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY & PHARMACOLOGY 2022The focus of our research is to elucidate the biochemical basis of human disease. We study degenerative conditions of the central nervous system as well as a diverse range of cancers, and our overarching aim is to generate the information needed to help develop and test new therapeutic options and to improve patient outcomes through enhanced disease detection and characterisation. Recent significant achievements include bench-to-clinic translation of a new drug for motor neurone disease and a first of its kind method for imaging cancer. To achieve these outcomes, we utilise a broad range of experimental paradigms, ranging from cells grown in culture through to direct examination of human tissue. Our analytical approaches span fundamental techniques (enzyme activity assays, gene expression analysis, histology and western blotting) through to highly sophisticated techniques such as quantitative in situ elemental imaging.PROJECT: UNDERSTANDING THE BIOCHEMICAL BASIS OF MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE Our team has identified an important biochemical change that occurs in tissue afflicted with motor neurone disease, a fatal disorder of the central nervous system for which effective treatments do not yet exist. Moreover, we have demonstrated that therapeutically targeting this change is protective, and our drug is now in the initial stages of clinical testing. However, a better understanding of how this biochemical change relates to the decline of functional motor neurones is still required. We are therefore examining changes to the abundance and functionality of specific proteins which we can relate to what we currently know about the drug's mechanism of action. An increased understanding of these mechanisms will advance our understanding of the causes of motor neurone disease and also the opportunity for additional therapeutic intervention.

In pursuing our motor neurone disease research, we established that some of the similarities with progressive multiple sclerosis may represent opportunity for therapeutic intervention. We have therefore been examining tissue samples from people who had progressive multiple sclerosis and also from models of the disease. We are using the information we have generated from our motor neurone disease research to guide these analyses. More extensive analysis of multiple sclerosis tissue is needed to help us consolidate the connection between the two diseases and therefore to further assess the opportunity to treat the two using a single therapeutic strategy.

We measure these changes using a quantitative elemental imaging technique known as laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). We analyse sections of biological material via LA-ICP- MS and the information generated provides an 'elemental image' of the disease. We use LA-ICP-MS to identify the presence of disease (e.g. tumour detection), to determine the biochemical basis of disease (e.g. changes in an elemental co-factor required for specific enzyme activities), and to monitor drug uptake and biodistribution.

In our laboratory we therefore complement our human tissue analyses with cell culture experiments in which specific phenomena can be controlled and examined in detail. We grow cells in the laboratory then we expose them to the conditions needed to induce a response comparable to what we have identified in the human disease. By analysing the treated cells, we are able to systematically map the sequence of events that lead to disease. This work is essential for identifying and validating therapeutic targets.

Our overarching goals are to establish proteases as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for inflammation and cancer and as novel drug targets for the treatment of these diseases. PROJECT: DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL CHEMICAL TOOLS TO MEASURE PROTEASE ACTIVATION Proteases are enzymes that cleave peptide bonds of proteins. To prevent cleavage at the wrong place or time, and thus protect the body from aberrant proteolysis, most proteases are synthesised as inactive proteins called zymogens. They become activated in response to a conformational change, which can be mediated by alterations in pH or cleavage by other proteases. Once activated, proteases are also subject to spatial and temporal regulation by endogenous inhibitors such as cystatins. As a result of these complex modes of post-translational modification, traditional biochemical methods that survey total protein levels rarely reflect the pool of active, functional enzymes. The ability to specifically measure and modulate the activity of a protease in its native environment is therefore required to define its precise proteolytic functions during health and disease.To achieve this, efforts from our team and others have focussed on developing activity- based probes (ABPs) for diverse cysteine and serine proteases. These tools capitalise on the catalytic mechanism of proteolysis, combining a protease recognition sequence with a reactive functional group called a warhead. When the catalytic residue of an active protease attacks this warhead, a covalent, irreversible bond forms. To detect the formation of this bond, and thus measure protease activity, ABPs are tagged with fluorophores that emit light only after protease cleavage. This fluorescence can be visualised using a number of optical imaging applications, including whole animal and tissue imaging, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and SDS-PAGE (in-gel fluorescence). The identity of the probe's targets can then be confirmed by immunoprecipitation with protease-specific antibodies or proteomic methods. This project will involve collaboration with chemists to develop novel activity-based probes for cysteine and serine proteases. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr Laura Edgington-Mitchell PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: UNDERSTANDING THE CONTRIBUTION OF PROTEASES TO ORAL CANCER PATHOLOGY Oral squamous cell carcinoma is the most common head and neck cancer. It is an extremely painful disease for which treatments are limited. Oral cancer often spreads to cervical lymph nodes, and once metastasis occurs, patient survival rates drop below 40%. Current methods to predict the spread of oral cancer are ineffective; thus, most patients undergo radical elective neck dissection to remove all cervical lymph nodes prior to the appearance of metastatic lesions. Our laboratory is investigating the contribution of proteases to oral cancer pain and metastasis. Proteases are a large family of enzymes that function as tiny molecular scissors to cut proteins. This process facilitates protein degradation and turnover, but also contributes to many cellular signalling events that underlie the growth and metastasis of oral cancer. This project aims to understand the functions of key proteases that are activated in human oral cancers using in vitro assays and in vivo mouse models. We will evaluate the utility of protease activity as a biomarker for predicting metastasis and as a potential drug target for the treatment of this deadly disease.

We use a range of structural (e.g. cryoEM, X-ray crystallography etc) and cell biology techniques to elucidate the structure and function of these molecular machines in situ, in their native context, inside 'living' cells. PROJECT: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF BACTERIAL CYTOSKELETAL FILAMENTS BY CRYO-EM Until early 1990s, cytoskeletal proteins were believed to be the hallmarks of eukaryotic cells. However, in the last three decades, the discovery of bacterial homologs of eukaryotic actin, tubulin and intermediate filament proteins have dramatically changed our perception. One of the key emerging difference between the bacterial and the eukaryotic cytoskeletal systems is that each of the bacterial filaments seem to perform one dedicated function while eukaryotic ones, by virtue of their interaction with a repertoire of adapters and regulatory proteins, perform numerous tasks. We are trying to understand how prokaryotic cytoskeleton was customised for multi-functionality during the evolution of eukaryotic cells. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr Debnath Ghosal PROJECT AVAILABILITY: Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY IN SITU: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF BACTERIAL SECRETION SYSTEMS BY CRYO-EM Bacteria harbour at least nine different types of secretion systems to transfer macromolecules across cellular envelope. These are sophisticated multi-protein nanomachines that secrete myriads of substrates including proteins, nucleoprotein complexes and variety of small molecules and are central to pathogenesis of multiple human diseases. For example, many pathogenic bacteria utilize the Type III Secretion System (T3SS) to cause diseases such as dysentery (Shigella), typhoid (Salmonella), plague (Yersinia) etc. Other human pathogens employ the Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) to mediate gastric cancer (Helicobacter), brucellosis (Brucella), typhus and spotted fevers (Rickettsia), as well as Legionnaires' disease (Legionella). The T4SS is also associated with the spread of antibiotic resistance, which currently presents a major threat to public health. Therefore, these molecular machines are attractive targets for drug developments to enrich our present repertoire of antibiotics. Structural studies with these molecular machines are extremely challenging due to their large number of components, flexibility and tight integration into the bacterial cell envelope.

PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr Debnath Ghosal PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science Honours 21 2022 DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY & PHARMACOLOGYGLEESON GROUP Membrane trafficking underpins many cell processes, including secretion, receptor signalling, endocytosis, antigen presentation, and neural networking. Many diseases arise from defects in membrane trafficking, including Alzheimer's disease. Our aim is to understand the molecular basis of membrane and protein sorting in the secretory and endocytic pathways in a variety of physiological processes using cultured cells and differentiated primary cells, and to exploit this knowledge for the design of new therapeutics. PROJECT: INTRACELLULAR TRAFFICKING IN NEURONS AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain consisting of an aggregated form of -amyloid peptide (A) derived from sequential amyloidogenic processing of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by membrane-bound proteases BACE1 and -secretase. The initial processing of APP by BACE1 is regulated by intracellular sorting events of the enzyme, which is a prime target for therapeutic intervention. We are interested in defining the intracellular trafficking pathways of APP and BACE1 and the sorting signals of these membrane proteins that define their itineraries. We have mapped the itineraries of these cargos in cultured human cell lines and our findings show that the distinct trafficking pathways of APP and BACE1 provides the capacity to finely regulate their co-localization and thereby regulating APP processing and A production. There is considerable evidence that dysregulation of membrane trafficking events is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. We are now defining the itineraries of APP and BACE1 in primary neurons, the cell type relevant for this disease. The project will map the post-Golgi anterograde transport pathways of APP and BACE1 in neurons, determine the selective trafficking routes to axons and dendrites, and assess the impact of neuronal signaling on these trafficking pathways. We have established a powerful new approach to synchronize and analyse the trafficking of newly synthesized membrane cargoes BACE1 and APP in real time. The project will incorporate this new approach with immunofluorescence, FACS and live cell imaging, together with the use of photoactivatable fluorescent probes to track the itineraries of these membrane cargoes. In addition, the role of specific transport machinery in APP and BACE1 transport will be assessed by silencing transport machinery using lentivirus to deliver RNAi. A wide range of other biochemical and cell biological approaches will also be employed.

The organization of the Golgi apparatus is highly dynamic and the Golgi ribbon can dissociate and re-organize under a variety of conditions, for example, during mitosis and to reposition the Golgi to accommodate a number of processes, including directed secretion and pathogen invasion. Surprisingly, and despite our knowledge of Golgi dynamics, the fundamental biological relevance of the \"ribbon\" structure of the Golgi in vertebrates has remained a mystery. The classic functions of the Golgi, namely membrane transport and glycosylation, do not require a ribbon structure and the relevance of the Golgi ribbon structure has been elusive. We have developed a cell-based system to explore the biological functions of the Golgi ribbon and have recently discovered that the Golgi represents a major intracellular hub for control of the mTOR signaling pathway and in regulating autophagy. mTOR signaling regulates many fundamental cell processes including growth and metabolism. Neurodegenerative diseases and cancer are often associated with changes in Golgi morphology and we have shown that the Golgi-localized mTOR signaling pathway are likely to contribute to these diseases. This project will investigate the role of the Golgi on the higher order functions of metabolism and autophagy in range of condition, including stress.

The Fc receptor protects these serum proteins from degradation by binding to IgG and albumin in endosomes after internalization by cells and releasing the proteins back into the plasma. There is considerable interest in exploiting this protective pathway to prolong the life time of engineered therapeutic proteins by attaching the FcRn ligand binding motif to recombinant therapeutic proteins. In collaboration with CSL at Bio21, this project will define the membrane recycling pathway of the FcRn, and the itinerary of albumin-based ligands, information which is critical for the optimizing the life span of therapeutic proteins. The project will analyse the role of FcRn in specific cell types including macrophages, dendritic cells and endothelial cells which are considered to be the major sites for recycling in the body. Both cultured and primary cells, derived from FcRn engineered mice, will be employed. A wide variety of biochemical and cell biological methods will be used including transfection cell systems, trafficking assays, coupled with RNAi silencing of transport machinery, to dissect the pathway of ligand internalization and recycling, the kinetics of recycling using quantitative biochemical assays, as well as mass spec analysis of the recycled ligands to determine if the itinerary of recycling has resulted in post-translational modifications which may impact on function.

Our current interests are proteins involved in viral-host cell interactions and the mechanisms of ligand-recognition and activation of G protein-coupled receptors. PROJECT: DEFINING THE HOST- VIRAL MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS OF RABIES PROTEINS. Symptomatic infection by rabies virus causes an incurable and invariably lethal disease. The virus manipulates the immune response of the host cell to avoid detection during replication. To achieve this viral proteins interact with and manipulate the function of proteins of the host cell. Key to this process is the rabies virus P-protein whose full functions are not understood. P-protein interacts with other viral proteins, including the rabies L- and N-proteins, for viral replication, but it also is known to bind the immune-signalling transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2, preventing them from entering the nucleus to activate antiviral in response to interferons. The regions and amino acid residues of P-protein that are involved in these processes are unclear, and the full extent of host protein/ P-protein interactions remain to be resolved. This project broadly aims to understand the molecular interactions of P-protein with its multiple targets and includes techniques such as mutagenesis to perturb specific interactions, and characterization of these mutants by cell-based assays. Mutants that lose (or gain) function will be structurally characterized and the impact on their molecular interactions determined using an array of techniques. These studies will lead towards the design of novel anti-virals and vaccines. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Prof Paul Gooley PROJECT AVAILABILITY: Master of Biomedical science Honours PROJECT: THE COMPLEX BINDING MODE OF THE PEPTIDE HORMONE H2 RELAXIN TO ITS RECEPTOR RXFP1. The insulin-like hormone relaxin has received recent clinical interest as a treatment for acute heart failure. The biological processes involving relaxin generally are through the activation of the G-protein coupled receptor, RXFP1. However, the molecular details of how relaxin interacts and activates RXFP1 are unclear. In part this is due to the complex multidomain structure of RXFP1: an N-terminal LDLa module essential for activation, a large leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain that is known to contain a relaxin binding site, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain that contains critical regions for activation. Structurally, we have only characterized the LDLa module. However, we have recently discovered that the 32-residue linker between the LDLa module and the LRR domain contains a second relaxin binding site, and therefore we hypothesize that relaxin binds to both this linker and the LRR domain to induce a conformational change, possibly of the linker, that reorients the LDLa module so it can effectively bind and activate the transmembrane domain. This hypothesis requires proving and opens opportunities in understanding receptor activation and the design of novel agonists and antagonists. There are multiple projects available involving mutagenesis of RXFP1 and relaxin, peptide synthesis and cell-based assays to monitor binding and activation of these mutants/ analogues; expression and purification of the domains of RXFP1, structural determination of these domains and characterization of their molecular interactions.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of signalling proteins (>800 gene members) located on the surface of all cells in the body, particularly in the brain. GPCR signalling controls virtually every physiological process in the body, making these receptors the targets of many current drugs treating conditions like pain, hypertension, schizophrenia and asthma. GPCRs exist as an ensemble of conformational states (inactive, intermediate and active) in equilibrium, with agonist binding shifting this equilibrium towards active states to stimulate cell signalling. A deeper understanding of the structural basis underlying GPCR signalling is needed to guide the design of improved therapeutics. The low expression levels and instability of GPCRs makes them difficult proteins to biochemically characterize. We have engineered high expressing, stabilized GPCRs that we can isotopically label for structural analysis with NMR. Using NMR we can observe that the receptors are dynamic and as expected that the conformational equilibrium is influenced by the binding of particular ligands (e.g. agonists vs antagonists). This project is focused on introducing NMR probes into these GPCRs so that we can characterize the structure and dynamics of specific domains within the proteins. Ultimately this will give us generic insight into how ligands engage GPCRs and how GPCRs transmit ligand binding signals into the cell.

We are particularly interested in the function and structural mechanisms of multimeric signalling complexes, protein effectors, oligomeric enzymes, and amyloid fibrils.PROJECT: APOLIPOPROTEIN A-I AND AMYLOID FIBRIL FORMATION IN DISEASE: CHANGE SHAPE AND MISFOLD? Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) binds phospholipid and cholesterol and mediates reverse cholesterol transport; the process by which cholesterol is removed from the body via high density lipoproteins (HDL). High plasma levels of apoA-I provide a number of beneficial effects in the cardiovascular system. However, apoA-I also forms amyloid deposits in atherosclerosis and in hereditary amyloidosis, which leads to failure of vital organs. Amyloid deposition is associated with many debilitating neurological and systemic diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes type II. Pathological apoA-I amyloid fibrils are generally composed of the N-terminal portion of the protein; however, very little is known about the mechanism of apoA-I amyloid formation in disease. We have demonstrated that oxidation of the methionine residues of apoA-I leads to amyloid fibril formation by the intact protein, providing a possible mechanism for amyloid deposition in atherosclerosis where oxidative damage to proteins is common. In vivo, the majority of apoA-I is bound to lipid in the form of HDL, which inhibits its propensity to misfold and form amyloid. This project will investigate the structural mechanism by which folded, lipid-bound apoA-I converts to a misfolded form and aggregates into amyloid fibrils. This will be achieved using a variety of biophysical and structural analyses of lipid- bound and lipid free apoA-I, including the use of conformationally-specific antibodies that recognise specific apoA-I structures.

Interleukin (IL)-11 is a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines that performs a wide range of biological functions. Recombinant human IL-11 is administered as a standard clinical treatment for chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. Recently, we identified a new role for IL-11 signalling as a potent driver of gastrointestinal cancers, and demonstrated that it is a novel therapeutic target for these diseases. Cell signalling by IL-11 is initiated by binding of soluble IL-11 to its membrane bound, specific receptor, IL-11R. This binary complex subsequently engages with the signal transducing receptor, GP130, inducing GP130 dimerisation and resulting in activation of the transcription factor Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)-3. Despite its importance, our understanding of the structure of the IL-11 signalling complex and the interactions between its components remains rudimentary. Our recent work has produced the first crystal structure and biophysical characterization of IL-11, and we are currently investigating the structural details of the complex between IL-11 and IL-11R. This project will use biophysical techniques, including NMR and X-ray crystallography, to understand the interactions between IL-11, IL-11R, and GP130 that lead to the formation of the active signaling complex. The ultimate goal is to use this information to design inhibitors of IL-11 signalling that may be useful as cancer therapeutics.

Coxiella burnetii is an intracellular bacterium that causes the human disease Q fever. C. burnetii infects alveolar macrophages, and replicates within a vacuole that matures to feature an acidic internal environment characteristic of a lysosome. During infection, over 150 effector proteins are translocated into the host cytoplasm to facilitate intracellular survival of the bacteria. One of these effector proteins, Cig57, is essential for replication of C. burnetii . We have discovered that Cig57 has a role in exploiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the eukaryotic host by interacting with the host cell nucleators of clathrin coated vesicles, FCHO1 and FCHO2. However, the functional mechanisms of this effector protein have not yet been determined. Our structural studies of Cig57 indicate that the protein consists of 3 domains. While we have solved the crystal structure of the central domain, the structural and functional properties and interactions of the other domains are unknown. This project will use biophysical and structural approaches to understand the structure of the individual domain components of Cig57 and their interactions with FCHO proteins, with a view to exploiting this information for development of therapeutic agents against Q fever.

As a major task for this system is to prevent damaged and misfolded proteins from accumulating, it has been hypothesized that, when this system becomes unbalanced, proteins can become prone to misfolding leading to their mislocalisation and accumulation as aggregates. Dysfunctional protein aggregation and protein homeostasis imbalance are central pathological features of common neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and motor neuron diseases. Our lab has several projects aimed at probing how the proteome becomes destabilized upon protein quality control imbalance and what the mechanisms are that become defective in neurodegenerative disease contexts. Approaches include cell biology approaches (such as microscopy, gene editing, flow cytrometry), proteomics and other cutting- edge biochemistry methods.

Inside the nucleus of a living cell, DNA is folded into a multi-layered 3D structure called chromatin. At any moment in time, thousands of proteins are diffusing throughout this structural framework - scanning the genome for a target DNA sequence. The question is \"does the chromatin network serve as 'road map' for molecular traffic during DNA target search?\" To investigate this, we are developing microscopy methods - based on fluorescence lifetime and correlation spectroscopy - to track how proteins move throughout the DNA networks of a living cell. Using this technology we have discovered sub-micron rearrangements in chromatin density that direct the diffusive route of DNA repair factors to damage sites and mediate transcription factor accumulation at specific nuclear locations. This body of work demonstrates an active role for 3D chromatin organisation in nuclear factor navigation. This is important because a hallmark of cancer is genome dysregulation. PROJECT: IMAGING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR DNA TARGET SEARCH IN A LIVING CELL Transcription factors have evolved DNA target search strategies that allow them to efficiently navigate the nuclear space and arrive at their specific DNA sequence. This target search strategy is underpinned by molecular diffusion, which in turn is controlled by the architectural organisation of the cell nucleus and oligomeric state of the transcription factor. Until recently no imaging approach could track the molecular mobility of protein oligomers within the nuclei of live cells. To address this research gap we recently established a new microscopy method to image the transport and binding dynamics of different oligomeric species in live cells (Hinde et al. 2016. Nature Comm. 11047). The overall aim of this project is to use to use this technology to uncover how the spatial compartmentalisation of the cell nucleus regulates transcription factor complex formation and DNA target search in a living cell. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr Elizabeth Hinde PROJECT CO SUPERVISOR Dr Jieqiong Lou PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: CHROMATIN DYNAMICS AND HOW THEY REGULATE THE DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE Tumour suppression relies on the preservation of genome integrity and this is maintained by a cellular surveillance system called the DNA damage response (DDR). Amazingly the DDR can almost instantaneously detect a genomic lesion. However, how it spatiotemporally coordinates DNA repair factor recruitment to that damage site is not currently understood. We recently demonstrated that double- strand breaks (DSB) induce a transient local 'opening' of chromatin at the damage site that is bordered by an increased level of chromatin compaction (Hinde et al. 2014 Biophys. J 107(1)). These dynamic rearrangements in local DNA density appear to facilitate DNA repair factor accumulation at only the damage site. By use of a fluorescence microscopy method that can track how proteins move throughout the 3D DNA network of a living cell, the aim of this project is to map the impact of nuclear wide changes in chromatin compaction on DNA damage signalling and repair.

The Brown group uses a range of molecular biology, cell biology and biochemistry techniques to investigate the ways in which deregulated cellular metabolism contributes to cancer initiation, cancer progression and therapy resistance. The knowledge gained from these studies is applied to the pre-clinical development of novel anticancer therapies PROJECT: FUELING CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANCE IN TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a molecularly heterogeneous group of diseases defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and absence of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) amplification. Consequently, TNBCs are impervious to therapies commonly used in other breast cancer subtypes and treatment options are largely limited to conventional chemotherapy agents. Approximately 30% of TNBC patients respond to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the long-term prognosis for the majority of patients with residual disease after chemotherapy is poor. Identification of novel and actionable strategies to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy would represent a major advance for the management of TNBC. Cancer cells exhibit dramatic alterations in cell metabolism, which support cell growth, proliferation and survival. Indeed, metabolic reprogramming is a recognized hallmark of cancer induced by numerous genetic or epigenetic alterations. Our recent studies suggest that reprogramming of cellular metabolism is also a component of the highly coordinated response to chemotherapy exposure. The aims of this project will be to 1) identify adaptive metabolic reprograming events triggered upon chemotherapy exposure, and 2) identify novel therapeutic approaches to exploit adaptive metabolic reprogramming events and sensitize TNBC cells to chemotherapy. This research will lead to the identification of critical mechanisms driving chemotherapy resistance in TNBC and establish combination therapy strategies with potential to have a major impact on patient survival. Students will gain experience in mammalian cell culture, molecular biology techniques, metabolomics and stable-isotope labelling techniques. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr Kristin Brown PROJECT AVAILABILITY: Master of Biomedical science Honours PROJECT: CUTTING OFF THE FUEL SUPPLY TO STARVE CANCER: IDENTIFYING METABOLIC VULNERABILITIES IN CANCER A universal characteristic of all cancer cells is the reprogramming of cell metabolism to provide the energy and building blocks necessary to support proliferation and survival. Reprogramming of cell metabolism occurs as a consequence of oncogenic mutations and renders cancer cells dependent on a unique set of nutrients. It is now widely recognized that the altered metabolic activity of cancer cells provides a window of opportunity to develop tumour-specific anticancer therapies. Using transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches, the aims of this project will be to: (1) compare and contrast metabolic reprogramming induced by well-described oncogenes; (2) compare and contrast the nutrient requirements of cancer cells dependent on well-described oncogenes and (3) identify and validate key metabolic vulnerabilities that can be targeted for the preclinical development of novel anticancer strategies.

In particular, we want to better understand how these cells are activated, the mediators they release and if we can translate this knowledge to generating new therapeutics.PROJECT: MRGPRX2-MEDIATED DRUG HYPERSENSITIVITY DRUG REACTIONS. Exciting new work has identified that mast cells have a receptor called MRGPRX2 that can be directly activated by many clinically used drugs including certain antibiotics. This might explain a significant number of drug hypersensitivity reactions. However, it is unclear as to why only some individuals react so adversely to these drugs. In this project you will examine mast cell activation through MRGPRX2 and identify pathways that enhance the activity of this pathway. This information will hopefully be of utility in better understanding, predicting and treating MRGPRX2-mediated drug hypersensitivity.

We utilize advanced mass spectrometry approaches, as well as a range of biochemical and genetic techniques to identify microbial metabolic pathways that are switched on during infection and are essential for pathgenesis. We are also interested in identifying metabolic pathways in the host cell that are required for pathogenesis. These studies are directed at understanding fundamental aspects of microbial pathogenesis, as well as developing new anti-microbial or host- directed therapies for these important diseases.PROJECT: IDENTIFICATION OF NOVEL PATHWAYS IN LEISHMANIA PARASITES Leishmania spp are sandfly-transmitted protozoan parasites that cause a spectrum of serious and potentially lethal diseases in more than 12 million people world-wide. Existing therapies are limited and there is an urgent need to identify new drug targets in these parasites. We have shown that these parasites synthesize a novel carbohydrate reserve material, termed mannogen, that is required for parasite growth in macrophages, the major target cell in the human host. We have recently identified a novel family of enzymes involved in mannogen synthesis and catabolism that are essential for virulence. This project will utilize a range of genetic and biochemical approaches to define the function of new protein that appears to have a key role in initiating (priming) mannogen synthesis. The project will investigate whether this protein is directly involved in mannogen priming (catalytic function), or whether it regulates the activity of the mannogen 'synthases' through protein-protein interactions (chaperone function). It will use in vivo proximity-tagging approaches (to measure protein-protein interactions), expression of recombinant protein, mutagenesis and enzyme assays and analysis of parasite central carbon metabolism using mass spectrometry.

One strategy to prevent or minimize antibiotic/drug resistance in infectious diseases is to develop drugs that target processes in the host cell that are essential for microbial growth, rather than the microbe directly. Such an approach may be useful against multiple pathogens and can complement immune strategies (such as vaccination). This project will investigate whether host-directed therapies can be developed to treat human leishmaniasis, a pathogen that infects 120 million people world-wide. We have identified >100 genes in the macrophage host that are required for Leishmania growth in genome-wide siRNA screen. In this project we will define how individual host genes impact on Leishmania infection using siRNA and/or CRIPR/Cas9 silencing/knock-down strategies. Detailed analysis of macrophage and parasite metabolism will also be investigated in genetically modified macrophages, providing fundamental information on host-parasite interactions.

Existing therapies are limited and there is an urgent need to identify new drug targets in these parasites. This project will exploit newly developed CRISPR/Cas9 genetic tools to generate a large panel of parasite mutants with defects in metabolic pathways that are hypothesized to be essential for parasite survival in host cells and infection. The mutants will be characterized using advanced mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling and 13C-stable isotope labeling to confirm the metabolic defect and identify any unanticipated by-pass pathways. Pooled parasite mutants (genetically bar- coded) will be assessed for loss of infectivity in host cell assays and further characterized biochemically.

The lab investigates how immunotherapies can be designed to exploit the cell biology of immune cells. Key interests include using nanoparticles as vaccines and investigating the molecular machinery involved in immune cell function. PROJECT: MANIPULATING IMMUNITY TO FIGHT INFECTION AND TUMOURS Vaccination currently represents the most effective strategy for eliminating infectious disease. While many vaccines are in use worldwide, for several pathogens our current vaccines fail with ensuing uncontrolled disease. This is the case for HIV, malaria and tuberculosis resulting in disease and devastation worldwide. Vaccines also have the potential to prevent and/or treat cancer, however this is currently not a clinical reality. Therefore, vaccine design must be advanced, and to do so, we require a more comprehensive understanding of the cell biology involved. A key question in vaccine biology is how are the proteins involved in this response trafficked to and from specialised immune cell compartments. This project will use CRISPR/Cas9 methodology, together with new mouse models of disease, to investigate the consequence of targeting specific components of the molecular machinery that participate in immune cell protein trafficking. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: A/Prof Justine Mintern PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: DECODING THE TRAFFICKING OF IMMUNE RECEPTORS. Ubiquitin is a protein tag that once attached to a substrate has important implications for its fate. Attachment of ubiquitin can change the intracellular trafficking route of the protein with important consequences for the cell. The ubiquitin chain attached is often termed a ubiquitin code and will differ for individual proteins. This project will investigate the role of ubiquitin in the tagging and trafficking of immunoreceptors. Specifically, it will investigate the MARCH family. MARCH are membrane associated E3 ligases that are responsible for attaching ubiquitin chains to substrate proteins embedded in membranes. How MARCH participate in controlling the intracellular trafficking of critical immune molecules in different immune and non immune cell types will be examined. In addition, this project will examine new MARCH substrates, how MARCH are regulated and determine the ubiquitin code generated by distinct MARCH family members. This project will use CRISPR/Cas9 methodology, flow cytometry and mass spectrometry to examine the role of ubiquitin in shuttling key immune molecules to specific destinations in the cell.

Nanoparticles have exciting potential to serve as modular therapeutic delivery systems that can target any cell type and carry any therapeutic peptide cargo.

While there have been significant successes in vaccine research, there are still many remaining challenges including developing vaccines against chronic infections such as HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, together with exploiting the potential of vaccination to eliminate cancer. To develop vaccines against chronic disease, nanoparticles are needed that can target the cells responsible for initiating immunity, dendritic cells, and release immunogenic peptides (antigen). Here, we will examine the potential of nanoparticles as carriers that enable effective vaccination. We will investigate how different nanoparticle formulations can be used to elicit immunity to infection and tumours. We will investigate caveospheres, biological nanoparticles consisting of vessicles derived from cell membranes, in addition to synthetic nanoparticles that can be designed with properties that enable manipulation of the endocytic pathway.

Email: mwp@unimelb.edu.au Website: go.unimelb.edu.au/42ir The focus of our research is to visualise the three-dimensional structures of medically important proteins using structural biology techniques including X-ray crystallography and cryo electron microscopy. A particular focus is proteins that play a role in infection (bacterial, parasitic or viral), cancer (particularly leukaemia, breast and prostate) and neurological diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinsons, autism). The structures provide a detailed understanding of how each protein works and how it contributes to disease. Most importantly, the structures can be used to discover drugs using computational and biophysical approaches.PROJECT: OVERCOMING CANCER DRUG RESISTANCE Conventional cancer chemotherapy kills rapidly growing cells indiscriminately, causing significant side-effects and can lead to disease re-occurrence and resistance to the drugs. One of our interests is the Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) family of proteins that function by recognising foreign small molecule toxins in the body, causing them to be eliminated from the cell. Unfortunately, commonly used anti-cancer drugs are also recognised as toxic by GSTs, which are often overexpressed in cancer tissues and are associated with transformation to malignancy and the adaptive resistance to anti-cancer drugs. There is thus an urgent need for the design of new anti-cancer drugs that circumvent the development of GST- mediated resistance to treatment. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the development of metal-based drugs as effective and potent protein targeted chemotherapies. We are investigating, though structural and biochemical means, how a range of ruthenium, arsenic and osmium- based drugs and drug-like compounds interact with GSTs. Students will investigate how these compounds work, as well as any drug-like molecules we develop, using X-ray crystallography and a range of biophysical techniques.

Despite their widespread occurrence and role in bacterial pathogenesis and immune defence, the detailed mechanism by which they form pores remains an enigma. The overall aim here is to visualise the 3D structures of family members as a basis for functional studies to reveal the molecular details of how these toxins insert into membranes to form beta- barrel pores and how the process is regulated.

However, the last decade has seen encouraging breakthroughs via refinement of existing techniques and development of new ones, together with the identification and exploitation of unexpected aspects of protein-protein interaction surfaces.

The burden of disease-causing parasites is particularly high in developing countries, and inadequate resources are directed towards the development of much needed treatments. Complete genome sequences are available for many of these parasites, so a wealth of data is available from which to search for potential targets for chemotherapeutic interventions. The group's interests lie in identifying and characterising promising drug targets from Plasmodium falciparum and other parasites, as well as studying the modes of action and mechanisms of resistance for existing drugs. PROJECT: TRNA SYNTHETASES ENZYMES AS ANTI-MALARIA DRUG TARGETS We are characterising aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) enzymes as drug targets in Plasmodium. These enzymes catalyse the attachment of amino acids to their relevant tRNA molecules and are essential for protein synthesis. They have recently been recognized as promising drug targets across a broad range of microbes, and we have recently identified Plasmodium aaRSs that are potential targets for new drugs to treat malaria. Plasmodium aaRS enzymes differ from those of humans, so we hope to develop drugs specific for Plasmodium. We are using in silico screening methods to identify likely inhibitors of Plasmodium tRNA synthetases and developing assays to measure specific inhibition of Plasmodium aaRS enzymes. We will also test inhibitors for their ability to kill Plasmodium grown in culture.

We have also demonstrated that this mechanism is necessary for parasites differentiating from human to mosquito life-stages. We will now apply novel long-read sequencing techniques to establish the impact of alternative splicing on whole transcripts in a variety of human and veterinary parasites.

In this project, you will apply multi-'omic analysis strategies using advanced lipidome and proteome technologies to identify altered lipid metabolism pathways and key lipid metabolism enzymes that are responsible for these changes at the tissue, cell, or sub- cellular levels, and to characterize changes in their lipid-protein 'interactomes', and then use genetic knock out/in (CRISPR/Cas9) and chemical inhibition, along with functional assays of cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, to probe the functional roles of these alterations in the regulation of cellular homeostasis.

INVESTIGATING NEURAL CIRCUITS UNDERLYING 'EMOTIONAL ' EATING. It is well established that stress and emotional state trigger binge eating. Notably, stress- related binge eating disproportionately affects females more than males, yet the precise biological mechanisms underscoring this sexual dimorphism remain underexplored. This has in part been due to the lack of robust animal models to recapitulate the human condition. To address this gap, we recently established a highly reproducible model of emotional stress-induced bingeing in female mice that is independent of caloric restriction commonly used in other models. Crucially, stress-induced bingeing in our model still occurred in ovariectomised mice, indicating that factors other than ovarian hormones must be involved. Our animal model provides an ideal tool to dissect the brain networks underscoring the stress-induced drive to eat in females.

These benefits are thought to occur via actions on the gut-brain axis which lead to alterations in the neuroendocrine regulation of appetite and glycaemia. Furthermore, the hedonic responses to high-fat, high-sugar foods are dampened after bariatric surgery and decreased levels of compulsive forms of eating behaviour such as emotional eating and binge eating are observed. The precise mechanism responsible for these positive effects on eating behaviour is currently unknown. Evidence is also emerging which shows that subset of patients experience adverse mental health effects, including suicide, self-harm, depression and substance use disorders. The causative and contributing factors behind these adverse effects are not well understood. This project explores the utility of using a mouse model of bariatric surgery to determine the mechanisms underlying the impact of this procedure on affective behaviour including depression-like and anxiety-like behaviour, as well as operant responding for palatable food and drugs of abuse.

The difficulty in treating HIV is that the virus hides inside a subset of the host immune cells, the T-cells. The solution to this problem would be to destroy the virus before it is able to enter the T-cells using the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanism. The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimer (Env), the only viral protein on the surface of virion, is thereby the main target to prevent infection. The challenge is that, at the surface of the virus, Env adopts a compact, closed conformation that is not recognized by antibodies inducing ADCC. After binding to its receptor at the surface of T cells, Env undergoes conformational changes and becomes more vulnerable to ADCC. Non-neutralizing antibodies increase the stability of this vulnerable conformation. In this project, you will use single particle cryo-EM and electron- tomography combined with subtomogram averaging to determine the high-resolution 3-dimentional structures of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein Env in conformations that are the vulnerable to ADCC. The changes of conformation are induced by binding of Env to its receptor (or receptor mimetic) and stabilised by binding of antibodies (Alsahafi et al., Cell Host & Microbe, 2019). The long- term goal of the research proposed here is to inform the development of new strategies for utilizing the ADCC response to eradicate HIV-1 infection. This project is ideal for a student with a strong computational background who is interested in combining computational biology and structural biology to conduct impactful research for human health.

They function as mechanotransducers by generating both electrical and ion flux signal as a response to mechanical stimuli. TACAN was recently been identified as the first ion channel responsible for sensing mechanical pain in neurones. TACAN is particularly interesting because it does not share sequence homology to any known class of ion channel. In this project, you will determine the structure using single particle cryo-EM of TACAN in its closed and open conformations. These structures are essential to understand the organisation of the channel. They will allow building of a model of the molecular mechanisms that control activation of this mechanosensitive ion channel. These structures will serve as a basis for functional studies to reveal the molecular mechanism of TACAN activation. The success of this project will make significant contributions to the fundamental understanding of pain sensing and signal sensing by cells in our body. This knowledge will allow the development of novel drugs to treat chronic pain. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: A/Prof Isabelle Rouiller PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: DECONSTRUCTING A MICROBIAL UNFOLDING MACHINE TO TARGET MAJOR KILLERS Cells from all kingdoms of life contain several protease systems that remove unwanted intracellular proteins. Protease systems cooperate with a subset of AAA ATPases (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) named unfoldases. These molecular machines unfold and deliver proteins into protease complexes. The best characterised unfoldase is the AAA ATPase p97. In human, p97 is a proven target for the treatment of various diseases including cancer and neurological diseases. Homologs of p97 have been identified in pathogens causing devastating diseases including tuberculosis and malaria. The dependence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the causative agent of Tuberculosis) and Plasmodium falciparum (the causative agent of malaria) on p97 homologs for protein degradation has identified p97 as a potential new target in the treatment of these infectious diseases. The structures of p97 homologues from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium falciparum and other parasites are currently unknown. The specific functions of p97 in these organisms are also unknown. Two projects are available to determine the structure of p97 homologs from 1) Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 2) Plasmodium falciparum. In these projects, you will use single particle cryo-EM to determine the structure of p97 homologs and combine a variety of biochemical, biophysical and mass-spectrometry approaches to characterise the assembly, dynamic properties and biological functions of p97 homologs. The goal of this project is to increase knowledge on these important molecular machines in mycobacteria and protozoa with the long term objective to develop inhibitors that would be specific to p97 from pathogens versus human p97. This project is ideal for a student with a strong background in biochemistry and who is interested in developing skills in protein science, including structural biology, mass-spectrometry and combined modern biophysical approaches. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: A/Prof Isabelle Rouiller PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science Honours 42 DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY & PHARMACOLOGY 2022PROJECT: CONTROL OF OPA1 ACTIVITY BY ACETYLATION IN NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES In neurons, mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that undergo frequent fission and fusion. Fusion and fission of mitochondria is necessary to meet the constantly changing energy demands of neurons. A balance between fusion and fission is essential to maintain healthy neurons. Excessive fission causes mitochondrial fragmentation and is associated with metabolic deficits and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and optic nerve degeneration. Mitochondrial fission and fusion are regulated by large dynamin like GTPases. OPA1 regulates inner membrane fusion and OPA1 mutations in humans cause a variety of neurodegenerative disorders including optic atrophy and Parkinson's disease. Lysine acetylation has emerged as a post-translational in mitochondria and neurodegeneration. OPA1 is acetylated at lysine 288. In this project, you will assess how OPA1 acetylation affects the GTPase activity of OPA1, its conformation and its ability to interact with the mitochondrial inner membrane lipids. You will use a combination of biochemical and biophysical including HDX and cross- linking mass-spectrometry and cryo-electron microscopy. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to gain an understanding of the importance of OPA1 acetylation in maintaining healthy neurons and the relevance of OPA1 acetylation in neurological diseases. This project is ideal for a student with a strong background in biochemistry and who is interested in developing skills in protein science, including structural biology, mass-spectrometry and combined modern biophysical approaches in order to better understand neurological diseases.

PROJECT CYSTIC FIBROSIS RECEPTORS DURING DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES The cystic fibrosis modulators have transformed clinical outcomes for many CF patients by improving survival and general health. However, the much greater prevalence of CF women reaching childbearing age means increasing numbers of women taking these medications face very difficult decisions when it comes to having a family. This study will aid clinicians in prescribing CFTR modulators to pregnant women on how these drugs will transfer across essential barriers during different developmental stages. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr Elena Schneider-Futschik PROJECT CO-SUPERVISOR: Norman Saunders Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND INFLAMMATION In this study, we will correlate the functional manifestations of cystic fibrosis with pathological changes in histopathology; and investigate whether administration of ivacaftor, the first CF gene modulator that has significantly improved the life of patients with CF; is beneficial in improving inflammation.

A key focus is on G protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest, yet potentially most underexploited class of drug targets. Our projects combine a wide range of methods such as: protein engineering, directed evolution, cell-based binding and UNDERSTANDING THE STRUCTURAL BASIS OF PEPTIDE- ACTIVATED G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR SIGNALLING TO ENABLE DRUG DISCOVERY . Cell-cell communication via endogenous peptides and their receptors is vital for controlling all aspects of human physiology. In humans, most peptides mediate their actions by binding to cell-surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which in response trigger intracellular signalling cascades. Because of the vital roles that peptides play, most of these GPCRs are considered pharmacological drug targets to treat a wide range of diseases. Despite this, only 18% of Class A peptide GPCRs are currently targeted by small molecule drugs, compared to 97% of the aminergic receptor family. This reflects a lack of knowledge about how peptides interact with and activate their cognate GPCRs, which hinders drug development and design.This project focuses on using novel directed evolution methods to engineer peptide GPCRs that preferentially exist in physiologically relevant conformations for which we do not have crystal or cryo-EM structures. The structures of these engineered GPCRs, bound to various peptides, will be investigated using X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM and NMR. Knowledge gained from these projects will contribute to the design of new drugs to treat a range of diseases and conditions such as: dementia, schizophrenia, chronic pain, heart failure, Parkinson's disease, anxiety and depression. Students will be trained in: protein engineering, protein expression and purification, GPCR pharmacological design.

However, these receptors represent prototypical GPCR subtypes, where determining the physiological roles and clinical targeting of 1A-AR and 1B-AR individually has been hindered due to their highly similar agonist binding sites and a subsequent lack of subtype selective tool ligands. Thus there is a need to identify novel, sub-type selective tool ligands to probe the validity of targeting 1A-AR or 1B-AR for these diseases. Fragment screening is a validated approach for identifying and optimizing compounds that are selective for certain protein family members over others but has not been directly applied to closely related GPCR subtypes. The primary reason for this is that the instability of purified GPCR preparations makes screening with the biophysical methods required for fragment screening challenging. We generated thermostabilized 1A-AR and 1B-AR variants suitable for biophysical studies, allowing the screening of a small, yet diverse fragment library with NMR spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance. This screen identified two structurally related hits that preferentially bound 1B-AR over 1A-AR, one of which was subsequently shown to exhibit 10-fold selectivity for inhibiting 1B-AR signalling. Another hit was a selective 1A-AR agonist. To develop these hits into tool compounds and potentially drug leads, this project will focus on understanding their structure-activity relationships of the hit molecules at each receptor. This will be probed using traditional molecular pharmacology and using biophysical approaches such as NMR. The resultant information will be used to develop novel compounds to elucidate the individual physiological roles of 1A-AR and 1B-AR and their potential as targets for disease treatments. Students will be trained in: protein expression and purification, GPCR PROJECT CO-SUPERVISORS: A/Prof Daniel Scott PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: ENGINEERING G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS FOR STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY AND DRUG DISCOVERY WITH DIRECTED EVOLUTION. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of signalling proteins (>800 gene members) located on the surface of all cells in the body, particularly in the brain. GPCR signalling controls virtually every physiological process in the body, making these receptors the targets of many current drugs treating conditions like pain, hypertension, schizophrenia and asthma. GPCRs exist as an ensemble of conformational states (inactive, intermediate and active) in equilibrium, with agonist binding shifting this equilibrium shift towards active states to stimulate cell signalling. A deeper understanding of the structural basis underlying GPCR signalling is needed to guide the design of improved therapeutics. To do this the major challenges for GPCR structural biology need to be overcome. These include: low expression and purification yields; low protein stability; and the inability to stabilize relevant receptor conformations for analysis. We engineer GPCRs that overcome these issues using in vitro directed evolution methods. Engineered receptors can then be used for crystallography, NMR and other biochemical techniques to further our structural understanding of these proteins and to facilitate structure-based drug design. This project focuses on developing novel directed evolution methods using lentiviral gene libraries to enable the engineering of GPCRs that preferentially exist in particular, physiologically relevant conformations for which we do not as yet have crystal structures. Such conformationally stabilized receptors will also give us insights into the protein dynamics that control GPCR signalling and provide tools to design new drugs that target and stabilize specific GPCR conformations. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: A/Prof Daniel Scott PROJECT AVAILABILITY: Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: UL TRASONICALLY DRIVEN USING MECHANO-RESPONSIVE PROTEINS The spatiotemporal nuances that underly neuronal signalling are vital for normal nervous system function but are mostly not understood. In recent years optogenetics has revolutionised the study of neuronal networks by allowing precise, optical activation or inhibition of specific neurons in living, free moving animals. To do this however, fibre optics and/or lasers must be surgically implanted into animals, which is challenging and may interfere with behaviour. This project aims to investigate targeted acoustic mechanical stimulation from micro- engineered systems on neurons and neuronal tissue. Importantly, this also seeks to improve understanding of the parameters required to activate native and transfected mechano- responsive proteins, including Piezo1/Piezo2. The development of this understanding will lead to new, potentially less invasive methodologies for neural interaction studies and potentially future treatment modalities. This interdisciplinary project lies at the intersection of multiple fields and will utilize techniques in biomedical engineering, protein engineering, microfluidics, microsystems engineering, 3D printing, cell signalling and neurobiology.

GPCRs have been implicated in a variety of disease states (CNS disorders, cancer, diabetes, etc.) and have proved highly tractable drug discovery targets, with >30% of current FDA-approved drugs acting through these receptors. A deeper understanding of the detailed structural & molecular mechanism underlying drug action at GPCRs is crucial for the rational design of improved medicines. We use a suite of techniques around biochemistry and structural biology, including cutting-edge single-particle cryo-EM, to obtain molecular level insights into how GPCRs can be targeted. Obtaining high-resolution cryo-EM structures of GPCRs can then be used to rational design improved drugs (small molecules or biologics), which we can test in a variety of molecular pharmacology assays to monitor improved efficacy or binding. This project focuses on using novel protein expression and purification techniques to obtain GPCR samples that can be used for structural biology (cryo-EM). Insights obtained from cryo-EM can be used to rationally investigate molecular pharmacology of these GPCRs, providing detailed insights into drug action and how it can be improved for desired properties i.e. more efficacious & safer therapeutics. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr Chris Draper-Joyce PROJECT CO-SUPERVISORS: A/Prof Daniel Scott PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: DIRECTED EVOLUTION OF THE HUMAN DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER (HDAT) FOR STRUCTURAL STUDIES. Dopamine is an essential neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that regulates a variety of CNS behaviours. The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) is a membrane transporter that is responsible for maintaining dopamine homeostasis, by clearing dopamine from the extracellular space via active transport. hDAT is implicated in various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Further, elicit drugs such as cocaine exert their psychostimulant effects via inhibition of hDAT. Despite the pathophysiological and drug discovery significance of hDAT, there is a relative lack of insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning its action. This lack of understanding is due to the inherent instability of hDAT in the detergents required for its purification, making biochemistry and structural biology techniques impossible. This project will focus on using novel techniques (directed evolution & protein engineering) to generate detergent stable versions of hDAT. These engineered hDAT variants will yield fundamental insights inot how this membrane protein functions, but also aid rational drug design of improved medicines at this important therapeutic target. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr Chris Draper-Joyce PROJECT CO-SUPERVISORS: A/Prof Daniel Scott PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: TARGETING NEUROTENSIN RECEPTORS WITH ANTAGONISTIC NANOBODIES TO TREAT CANCER. The neuropeptide neurotensin (NTS), and its cell-surface receptor NTSR1, have been strongly implicated in driving the progression of a number of solid tumour types, including lung, colorectal, pancreatic, breast and prostate cancers via autocrine signaling. NTS and NTSR1 have been shown to be upregulated in many solid tumours and NTS stimulates cell growth and metastasis through NTSR1 signaling. A small molecule NTSR1 antagonist (SR-48692) blocks cell proliferation and tumour growth in a number of cancer models, but failed in clinical trials to treat small cell lung cancer. A lack of selectively binding tool molecules at NTSR1 that do not cross the BBB hinders our understanding of how the NTS system stimulate the growth and spread of various cancer types. Single-chain, camelid antibodies, called nanobodies (Nbs) have several advantages in targeting GPCRs for cancer therapy. GPCRs such as NTSR1 are expressed widely, with specific signalling roles depending on the tissue. NTS stimulation of NTSR1 in the central nervous system regulates dopaminergic signalling, blood pressure, thermostasis, appetite and pain transmission. Thus antagonistic anti-cancer drugs that can cross the BBB, such as SR-48692, will have on-target side effects on these pathways. Nbs do not readily cross the BBB and thus can selectively target the peripheral NTSR1 expressed on cancer cells. Compared to small molecules, Nbs are also simple to functionalise with radioisotope-chelating cages or with modalities to increase circulating half-life. Through our deep understanding of NTSR1 structure and function, and by developing a novel platform for anti-GPCR Nb discovery, we have identified many anti-NTSR1 Nbs. This project seeks to characterize the binding and pharmacological activity of some of these anti-NTSR1 Nbs and explore the potential of these molecules as cancer detection agents and future therapeutics.

PROJECT: \"CLOCK-OFF TIME\" FOR INFLAMMATION AND REMODELLING CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASES: CASEIN KINASE 1 DEL TA INHIBITOR Chronic inflammatory diseases (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) exhibit a marked time of day variation in symptoms, airway inflammation and airway physiology. There is growing evidence supporting that the molecular clock is important in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. If time of day is important, then it follows that treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases should also be tailored to the most efficacious time of the day, known as \"chronotherapy\". Casein kinase 1 (CK1) has been implicated as a major regulator of the biochemical oscillator that determines circadian rhythm. Our laboratory has implicated CK1 in signalling some of the fibrogenic and inflammatory actions of TGF-, including the ability to switch off the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. We hypothesize that CK1 inhibitors reset the CLOCK to suppress inflammation. In this project, you will characterise the anti- inflammatory potential of CK1 inhibitor class using primary human cells obtained from peripheral blood and/or from the airways. Methods to be used will include immunoassay, real-time quantitative PCR, cell culture and high content screening using plate-based confocal microscopy.REFERENCE: Li, M., C. R. Keenan, G.

PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr Meina Li PROJECT PhD Honours Master of Biomedical scienceSTEWART DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY & PHARMACOLOGY 2022THE STOJANOVSKI GROUP is working to understand the inner workings of one of the cells most intriguing and important organelles, the Mitochondrion. Mitochondria are the cell's power plant, where sugars from the food we eat are converted into energy that our bodies need to survive. Our lab is interested in how mitochondria are created and how they function in health, but also situations of dysfunction that lead to disease. PROJECT: THE MACHINES AND PATHWAYS THAT FACILITATE MITOCHONDRIAL PROTEIN IMPORT IN HUMAN CELLS Inside each mitochondrion is a workforce of approximately 1500 proteins, which collaborate to perform the many critical functions of the organelle. These proteins are trafficked from their site of synthesis in the cytosol to their correct Location: within mitochondria, a process referred to as 'protein import'. If mitochondrial protein import fails, energy production and general mitochondrial health and function is affected. Therefore, not surprisingly dysfunctional protein import is linked to mitochondrial disease and other human pathologies. In spite of this, our understanding of mitochondrial protein import and import machineries in human cells remains poor. Our lab is interested in elucidating the molecular architecture of human import machines and elucidate how they govern protein import in mammalian cells. For instance, we recently identified novel metazoan specific subunits, Tim29 and AGK (Kang et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2017 ), which are components of the inner membrane trans Location: machine, TIM22 complex. Current efforts in the lab are focused on: (i) characterizing known mitochondrial import machines across human cell types; (ii) identifying novel facilitators of these pathways; and (iii) investigating how protein import dysfunction leads to mitochondrial disease. Projects in this space utilise a variety of cell and molecular biology techniques, including mammalian cell culture, CRISPR/ Cas9 gene editing techniques, molecular biology, confocal microscopy, Blue-native PAGE electrophoresis, protein chemistry and proteomics. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr Diana Stojanovski PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: MITOCHONDRIA AS TARGETS DURING BACTERIAL PATHOGENESIS Invasion of a human cell by pathogenic bacteria often requires that the bacteria manipulate the eukaryotic cell biology to create a replicative niche and evade killing. To achieve this, intracellular bacterial pathogens transport virulence proteins, termed effectors, into the host cytosol and beyond to other cellular compartments. Effector proteins from different bacteria and viruses are known to target mitochondria and try and manipulate organelle function. We are currently investigating the intracellular and Legionnaire's disease, respectively. In collaboration with Dr Hayley Newton we are: (i) working towards establishing the entire repertoire of effector proteins from these two bacterial species that are targeted to mitochondria; (ii) establishing how infection manipulates the mitochondrial proteome and function. Participation in this project will involve characterizing of novel effector proteins, how they are delivered to the mitochondrion and how they interact with mitochondrial proteins to allow these intracellular bacterial pathogens to replicate within a eukaryotic cell.

We employ a range of mass-spectrometry techniques, including shotgun proteomics, affinity enrichment and BioID proximity studies, metabolic labelling and multi- omics approaches and combine them with patient derived cell lines, CRISPR/ Cas9 gene editing, and classical biochemistry. Our research is aimed at both understanding the primary biology underpinning human disease, as well as developing systems biology tools to improve patient diagnostic outcomes. PROJECT: USING PROTEOMICS TO DIAGNOSE MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE Genetic disorders affecting mitochondrial energy production constitute the most common form of inherited metabolic disease, affecting ~1/5000 births. The diagnosis rate for mitochondrial disease is only ~60%. While whole genome sequencing is routinely applied to patients with suspected mitochondrial disease, sorting through the sheer number of different genomic variants detected in each individual means that for many patients a molecular diagnosis takes months or years. Our lab is developing the use of quantitative proteomics to rapidly prioritise variants of unknown function while simultaneously providing functional validation of their impact on mitochondrial metabolism. With our collaborators we have now used proteomics to assist in the diagnosis of more than 10 patients with suspected mitochondrial disease (see Lake et al., 2017 Am. J. Hum. Genet. and Frazier et al., 2020 Med as examples). We are now focused on further developing the technique for routine use in diagnosis. This project will utilise quantitative proteomics on patient cell lines, system biology analyses. The project will involve development and optimisation of proteomics sample preparation techniques, as well as the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to validate candidate disease genes. You will also become skilled in molecular cloning, protein biochemistry and human cell culture techniques. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr David Stroud PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: ASSEMBLY OF THE COMMANDER COMPLEX Sorting of proteins and lipids into and out of the endomembrane system is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Defects in the machineries that control this process lead to a number of debilitating diseases, including neurodegeneration, hypercholesterolemia and Wilson's disease. Recently, a new and evolutionarily conserved receptor recycling complex known as Commander was discovered. We and others propose that Commander is an endosomal sorting machinery required for the transport and homeostasis of vital plasma membrane receptors. The principles that govern the assembly of the 16 Commander subunits into the multisubunit complex however, as well as the overall mechanism by which this complex regulates endosomal trafficking in health and disease remains completely unknown. In this project you will use CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out Commander subunits and accessory factors in human cell lines. You will perform shotgun quantitative proteomics and Blue-Native PAGE to understand the effect of subunit loss on complex assembly. Affinity enrichment and BioID proximity labeling coupled to mass-spectrometry will be used to probe protein-protein interactions. In addition, you will become proficient in molecular cloning, confocal microscopy, protein biochemistry and human cell culture techniques. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr David Stroud PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursSTROUD GROUP Proteomics MetabolismMetabolic Organelles PHARMACOLOGY 2022PROJECT: BIOGENESIS OF MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEXES Is has been estimated that, even at rest, our bodies turn over ~70kg of ATP each day. More than 90% of this is generated through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which occurs on the five membrane protein complexes comprising the respiratory chain. Mitochondria are comprised of ~1500 different proteins. Over 80 of these are subunits of respiratory chain complexes and >50 others known as assembly factors are needed for their biogenesis and regulation. Many more proteins support energy production indirectly. Surprisingly, we still don't know the functions of ~200 human mitochondrial proteins! This project is focused on characterising selected mitochondrial proteins of unknown function (see Hock et al., 2020 Mol. Cell. Proteom. as an example). Most of these are implicated in mitochondrial disease, the most common form of inherited metabolic disease, affecting ~1/5000 births. Here, you will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing to knock out uncharacterised proteins to validate their involvement in mitochondrial energy generation. You will also utilise newly developed affinity enrichment and BioID proximity labelling tools coupled with mass- spectrometry to identify their protein-protein interactions. Shotgun proteomics as well as metabolomics will be used to understand the impact of protein loss on the proteome and metabolome. In this project you will become familiar with mammalian cell culture, molecular cloning, mass-spectrometry and systems biology, Blue-Native PAGE, bioenergetic measurements, and general protein biochemistry techniques. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Dr David Stroud PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: MUL TI-OMIC ANALYSIS OF EXERCISE INDUCED CHANGES TO MITOCHONDRIA Mitochondria, better known as the 'powerhouse of the cell', are responsible for oxidative phosphorylation, providing the necessary energy the body needs to function. In addition to generating the bulk of cellular ATP, mitochondria direct a vast array of biological functions essential for cellular homeostasis. A long-standing question in biology concerns the biogenesis and regulation of mitochondria in response to stress and the metabolic needs of the cellular environment. Exercise represents a major challenge to both these pathways while also being arguably one of the most 'natural' perturbations available. While it is already known that high-intensity exercise alters the transcriptomic regulation of genes within the mitochondria differently compared with low- intensity exercise, there is far less literature on the proteomic, metabolomic and lipidomic changes.In collaboration with our partners at the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Active Living (ISEAL) we have performed longitudinal multi-omics analyses of skeletal muscle from individuals subjected to increased volumes of exercise. In this 'dry-lab' informatics-only project, you will develop new methodologies to analyse this multi-omics dataset and identify the pathways and systems induced or repressed following exercise. You will also be involved in development of an interactive website allowing users to explore the data. As a pre-requisite for this project you will have some experience in programming languages (R, Python or similar) and/or web development frameworks (e.g Django, Flask). As an outcome of this project you will become proficient in the use of bioinformatic packages (e.g Limma, edgeR, mixOmics) as well as interpretation and visualisation of systems biology data.

The van Driel laboratory is seeking to define the main cells and factors that control innate immune responses in tissues and particularly the lung and the gut. PROJECT: IMMUNE RESPONSES TO PATHOGENIC BACTERIA Bacterial infectious diseases account for ~10 x 106 deaths annually. Our research is directed toward maximizing the chances of developing more effective vaccines and antimicrobial drugs through a better understanding of how the immune system combats bacterial infections. Immune responses in infected tissues are essential for controlling invading pathogens in the early phases of infection. Despite having a vital role, the main cells and factors that control innate immune responses in tissues are poorly defined. To gain an integrated understanding of the in vivo innate immune network in lung tissue, we are investigating the immune response to the intracellular lung bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila. This important opportunistic pathogen causes Legionnaires' disease, a vastly under diagnosed disease that is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality . We have revealed a cooperative circuit in the response to Legionella infection. Inflammatory dendritic cells induced production of the important cytokine IFN by lymphoid. IFN, in turn, was necessary for bacterial killing by the inflammatory dendritic cells. Surprisingly, macrophages that engulf bacteria did not respond to IFN. We will continue this project by addressing a number of important questions each of which could be the basis of a research student's project.Why are macrophages unable to kill bacteria even in the presence of stimulatory cytokines like IFN? We have discovered that another cytokine IL23 plays an important role in combatting Legionella . Which cells make IL23 and how does it act to kill bacteria? Macrophages are the cell type inside which Legionella bacteria replicate. Why can't Legionella replicate in other similar cells like dendritic cells? IFN can convert inflammatory dendritic cells into bacterial killers. What are the key molecular changes that are induced by IFN? Techniques commonly used in this laboratory: Flow cytometry, cell culture, use of mice and infection of mice, immunoblotting, immunolocalisation in cells, quantitative PCR, bioinformatic analysis of expression data.

As part of its pathogenesis, L. pneumophila infects alveolar macrophages and avoids fusion with lysosomes. Whereas macrophages propagate bacterial replication, other immune cell types are required for bacterial killing. In particular, we have discovered that monocyte derived cells (MDC) play an important role in controlling L. pneumophila infection in the lung. moDC are recruited to the lung in large numbers early during L. pneumophila infection and we believe that MDC internalize and kill the bacteria in an interferon gamma (IFNg) dependent manner. Our RNAseq analysis of lung moDC from wild type and IFNg-deficient mice showed that IFNg induced the expression of multiple interferon inducible GTPases (GBPs/IRGs). While most GBPs and IRGs are not yet characterized, some localize to intracellular pathogen vacuoles and may induce killing through novel mechanisms. We hypothesize that moDC utilize GBPs and IRGs to kill intracellular L. pneumophila. THE AIMS OF THIS PROJECT IS TO: Investigate the intracellular localization of selected GBPs and IRGs during L. pneumophila infection Identify GBPs and IRGs that restrict L. pneumophila intracellular replication Test selected GBP- and IRG-deficient mice for susceptibility to L. pneumophila infection TECHNIQUES COMMONLY USED IN THIS LABORATORY: Bacterial culture, in vitro bacterial infection of cultured cells, enumeration of bacterial replication, RNAi knockdown, confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy, construction of stable inducible cell lines, molecular biology including primer design, mutagenesis and PCR, western blotting, immunoprecipitation, mouse infection.

We are characterizing the development, regulation and impairment of antigen presenting cells by pathogens, inflammatory mediators and tumours. We are also dissecting the biochemical machinery involved in antigen capture, processing and presentation. We use this knowledge to understand how T cell-dependent immunity is initiated and maintained, and apply it to design better vaccines and immunotherapies against infectious agents and cancer.PROJECT: REGULATION OF IMMUNE RECEPTOR EXPRESSION AND TURN-OVER BY UBIQUITIN LIGASES Cell viability and function requires maintenance of the correct protein composition and distribution within the cell at all times. This proteostasis is regulated by mechanisms that control protein synthesis, localisation and degradation. Cells can also respond to external signals to alter proteostasis, allowing them to adapt to changes in their environment. In cells of the immune system, expression of many important receptors is regulated by addition of the protein Ubiquitin by the MARCH family of ligases. MARCH ubiquitination thus plays major roles in immunity against pathogens and cancer. The MARCHs also play important roles in control of infection by viruses. However we know very little about MARCH specificicity and regulation. This project will employ biochemical techniques, microscopy, proteomics, and CRISPR-Cas9 technology to characterise the function of the MARCH family; identify novel MARCH substrates; and characterise the machinery involved in ubiquitination by MARCHs. Our goal is to develop novel therapeutic approaches to fight infection and cancer based on manipulation of membrane protein ubiquitination. Further reading: L Young et al (2008) Nat.

PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Prof. Jose Villadangos PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: A NOVEL LINK BETWEEN METABOLISM AND HOST DEFENCE: O-GLCNAC GLYCOSYLATION O-GlcNAc glycosylation involves addition of a single sugar, -N-acetylglucosamine, to serine or threonine residues of proteins. It is a unique type of glycosylation found on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The addition and removal of OGlcNAc is catalysed by OGlcNAc transferase (OGT) and OGlcNAse (OGA) respectively. It is a reversible modification akin to phosphorylation. Indeed, OGlcNAc glycosylation occurs in dynamic interplay with phosphorylation, either on the same or adjacent residues. The cross-talk between these two modifications in turn regulates various cellular processes. In this project we will characterise the function of OGlcNAc glycosylation in a type of immune cells (Denditic cells, DC) that play a critical role in immunity against infection and cancer. We will identify changes in patterns of glycosylation in different metabolic states and upon encounter of pathogens. The function of glycosylated proteins will be further studied to understand the relevance of their OGlcNAc status in various immune cell activities. Finally, we will characterize how OGT and OGA recognize their substrates and the mechanisms that regulate their function. These studies may allow us to design therapeutic drugs that target O-GlcNAc glycosylation to manipulate immune responses against pathogens or cancer.

Its clinical importance as a regulator of extracellular proteolysis in the vascular system is demonstrated by the association between low serum Cst C levels and formation of atherosclerotic plaques, due in part to uncontrolled proteolytic degradation of arterial elastin. A different property of Cst C that makes this protein clinically relevant is that it can form amyloid fibrils, which are found in the cerebral vasculature of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Such fibrils are believed to originate by a phenomenon known as \"domain swapping\", whereby two Cst C monomers associate by \"exchanging\" subdomains to generate homodimers. These dimers can then be extended by additional rounds of domain swapping and thus form amyloid fibrils. The cells responsible for Cst C production in vascular disease are unknown. Identification of these cells, and characterisation of the mechanisms that control the synthesis and dimerisation of Cst C will lead to the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diseases associated with Cst C.

PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Prof. Jose Villadangos PROJECT AVAILABILITY: PhD Master of Biomedical science HonoursPROJECT: UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS THAT IMPAIR ANTI-TUMOUR ADOPTIVE CELL THERAPY Tumour cells express neo-antigens that can be recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). These tumour-specific CTL can be isolated, expanded and inoculated to kill cancer. Unfortunately, in many individuals the tumour 'fights back' and inactivates the infused CTL, compromising the therapy. Using a mouse model of lymphoma, we are performing studies to improve outcomes. Our goal is to apply our findings to the clinic and improve the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy. The aims of this project will be to identify genes that control the outcome of adoptive cell therapy, and characterise the interactions between T cells and the tumour.

It is characterised by inflammation accompanied with immunosuppression, and the latter can last for several weeks. The immunosuppressed patients are at risk of suffering secondary or opportunistic infections, a major contributor to morbidity and death in intensive care units. Impairment of macrophages and dendritic cells (DC), the primary initiators of T cell immunity, plays a prominent role in this immunosuppression post-SIRS. In this project we will use models of infection to characterise the mechanisms that cause immune cell paralysis and to develop therapies to prevent immunosuppression.

It does this by capturing metabolite by-products from bacteria and presenting them at the cell surface to activate a highly abundant T cell subset, called mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. MR1 is a highly conserved piece of the mammalian immune repertoire to detect bacterial pathogens, yet basic aspects of its cell biology are not well understood. This project will investigate the molecular machinery underpinning the biology of MR1 molecules, using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and cutting-edge cell biology and biochemistry techniques.

MSc HonoursPROJECT: TROGOCYTOSIS: A NOVEL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM BETWEEN CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM Intercellular communication is an inherent property of all metazoans. In most cases, cells communicate via interactions between plasma membrane receptors, or via soluble ligands secreted by one cell and recognised by a receptor on another cell. We will study a third form of communication described decades ago and that is thought to play major roles but remains poorly understood, namely trogocytosis. This activity entails transfer of plasma membrane from one cell to another. We have discovered that a fundamental cellular component of the innate immune system, Marginal Zone B cells (MZBC), constitutively trogocytose plasma membrane from a fundamental cellular component of the adaptive immune system, Dendritic Cells (DC). This trogocytic event is strictly dependent on the formation of a newly-discovered complex comprised of two molecular components: Complement C3 and MHC class II molecules (MHC II). This is in itself a highly significant finding because formation of MHC II-C3 complexes may be a novel mechanism for capturing and eliminating potentially harmful C3 constitutively activated by the so-called \"Tick-Over\" pathway. In this project we will use a variety of biochemical approaches and high-end microscopy to describe the function of these hitherto unknown interactions between fundamental cellular and molecular components of the immune system. We will also characterise the molecular mechanisms underpinning trogocytosis, an activity that is believed to play major roles not just in immunity but also in other biological systems. PROJECT SUPERVISOR: Prof. Jose Villadangos PROJECT CO-SUPERVISOR A/Prof Justine Mintern and AVAILABILITY: Master of Biomedical science Honours PROJECT: IMPROVING THE FORMATION OF PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY AGAINST HUMAN VIRUSES CD4+ helper T cells underpin the generation of life-long protective immunity against infectious disease. They are pivotal for activating CD8+ killer T cells and driving B cell production of neutralising antibodies, which are both required to recover from and prevent infection. However, the CD4+ T cells that are activated following infection are not generally assessed in studies of vaccine efficacy and/or protective immunity. In addition to established functions of effector CD4+ T cells in driving immune memory is an emerging role for regulatory T cells (Tregs), which until now have been under-appreciated in this context. Tregs, in addition to their critical role in maintaining self-tolerance, are important in limiting immunopathology following infection. Further, evidence from mouse studies suggests Tregs are crucial for the generation of memory T cells and also control the homing of immune cells into infected tissues. However, it remains unknown if these are also key functions for human Tregs. This project will investigate the mechanisms of how human Tregs shape immune memory responses using cutting-edge technology including organoid co-culture, gene editing, functional cellular assays and spectral cytometry. Data from this project will form a foundation for designing more efficacious treatment and prevention strategies for infectious diseases.

For such intracellular viral pathogens, there is an emerging appreciation of the importance of long-lived cellular immunity for both viral clearance and generation of protective memory responses. Critical early events shaping anti-viral T cells include cytokine signals from innate cells, such as macrophages, and the presentation of antigen from professional antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells. Other pulmonary infections caused by viruses or bacteria cause profound life-threatening immune paralysis, with macrophages and dendritic cells unable to perform these functions. As the ability of dendritic cells to present antigen and provide appropriate signals to T cells is a key step in initial activation and subsequent reactivation of virus-specific cells, aspects of immune paralysis will likely have profound effects on cellular immunity and antibody production. This project will enrol local patient cohorts to investigate whether prolonged immune dysfunction occurs after COVID-19 infection and whether this is associated with impaired generation of immune memory to SARS-CoV-2.

Nuclear export of mRNA to the cytoplasm is required for gene expression and is deregulated in cancer. Our ultimate goal is to use these fundamental biological insights to develop novel first-in-class inhibitors to treat cancer.PROJECT: MECHANISMS OF REGULATING GENE EXPRESSION VIA SELECTIVE MRNA TRANSPORT A critical step in the gene expression pathway that is altered in cancer is nuclear export of mRNA. We have demonstrated that mRNA export is not constitutive, but highly selective and can regulate distinct biological processes through poorly understood mechanisms. This project aims to dissect the molecular mechanisms of regulating gene expression via selective mRNA transport. This will establish selective mRNA export as a novel area of research in cancer biology.

The progression to a vasospastic state and its neurological sequelae represents an acutely debilitating pathology with a poor clinical prognosis and, for survivors, a high burden of disease (Rowland et al., 2012). Calcium channel antagonists such as nimodipine, which can ameliorate some of the vasoconstriction and excitotoxicity, are routinely given following surgical coiling or clipping of the aneurysm. However, further clinical intervention, currently hyperdynamic therapy or angioplasty, upon progression to a symptomatic vasospasm remains a necessity. In most cases, these interventions restore cerebral perfusion but have the potential for significant complications. Identification of appropriate biomarkers for the vasoconstriction and neurological sequelae has the potential to inform improved post-surgical management of aSAH. Hypothesis: Development of CVS involves identifiable changes in the ratio of vasoactive, inflammatory and excitotoxic mediators following aSAH. Specific aim: To obtain a temporal profile of functional, proteomic and metabolomic markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients following aSAH.NATURE OF THE WORK The Department of Surgery at the Royal Melbourne Hospital (RMH) has 60-70 cases of aSAH per annum and collects CSF as part of the routine care of patients post- surgery. We have received approval from the RMH Human research ethics committee (MH Project number 2012.50) to undertake proteomic and metabolomic analysis of the CSF from these patients. Preliminary data indicate that ratiometric changes in certain proteins in the 10 - 40 kDa range may predict the likelihood of a patient developing CVS. This project will seek to extend these studies to include an analysis of proteins in higher and lower MW ranges (Rowland MJ, Hadjipavlou G, Klly M, ischaemia Journal SUPERVISOR: Associate Professor James Master Biomedical Email: mechanisms of and Sub-arachnoid haemorrhage 59 2022 DEPARTMENT Code: 00116K Intellectual property: Copyright in this publication is owned by the University and no part of it may be reproduced without the permission of the University.
