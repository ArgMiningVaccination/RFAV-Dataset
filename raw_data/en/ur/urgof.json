It's maybe one notch less intense than a month ago, as I'm able to do very slightly more activities, though still not a lot. I've just posted a fuller reply if your interested, I guess it will appear shortly above this message. Hi all, On page 18, there is a WHO report about the link to tinnitus from the vaccine. [ https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/351326/9789240042452-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y ](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/351326/9789240042452-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) Wishing everyone well. [@watis](https://vestibular.org/participant/watis/) how did you make out at your doctor??? Any news??? Hope you are feeling a little better.

Found this part on pages 21-22 of interest: \"A potential mechanism for COVID-19 vaccine-associated hearing loss could be an autoimmune process involving molecular mimicry related to the vaccine's antigen, or bystander activation of autoreactive T-cells that may involve the vestibulocochlear nerve (vestibular nerve is involved in balance and equilibrium functions, and cochlear nerve in hearing function).21-24 Involvement of this nerve can contribute to symptoms related to labyrinthitis, which involves both vestibular and cochlear branches of the nerve or vestibular neuritis, which involves vertigo, dizziness and nausea.25 Two cases in the VigiBase analysis mentioned the potential diagnosis of labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis made by ENT specialists. Furthermore, analysis of VigiBase in patients vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine showed a disproportionality for vestibular neuronitis (13 observed and 2 expected) and labyrinthitis (19 observed and 6 expected). Studies on vaccinations and neurological disorders, including cranial nerve involvement reported the potential time windows for symptom onset as being several hours to several weeks depending on the neurological disorder.14,20,21,26 Currently, clinical evidence and studies on potential mechanisms and the relation between vaccines and neurological disorders, cranial nerve palsies and hearing loss, remain limited. ...Awareness of this possible link may help healthcare professionals and those vaccinated to monitor symptoms and seek care, as appropriate.\" At least WHO is bringing up some potential mechanisms involved in these adverse vaccine reactions. Hope this research continues and those with vaccine injuries try to report their symptoms to WHO as well as to VAERS (in the U.S.) and to the vaccine manufacturers (Pfizer or Moderna, J&J, etc...). It seems the only way these adverse effects may be fully acknowledged is if there are enough reports that they can no longer be hidden.

Thank you, Dr. L. Here is a blog from a Covid scientist who experienced adverse reactions. Perhaps this could be shared with doctors who are dismissive.

The author keeps on droning on about being \"privileged\" despite her situation and that she would get another shot. Something I would absolutely NOT do if coming down with anything similar to what she claims to have. Furthermore, a lot of swearwords when referring to people making different choices for themselves (\"anti-vaxxers\", as she calls them). She appears as woke as they come. Big oof. Update from my side: Still experiencing dizziness. Received my first vaccination with Pfizer on 17th of May 2021. Dizziness started August 1st of the same year. Received second vaccination on August 24, 2021 as it was required for traveling abroad for business. Have always been reluctant to take the vaccinations, but was unfortunately more or less forced. D-dimer seems in normal range. I'm planning to check for Anti-nuclear antibodies, as I see a lot of people here coming down with elevated levels. Might be worth checking for auto-immune related issues. [@moonbeam](https://vestibular.org/participant/moonbeam/) Wow, what a read... that scientist doesn't seem to know which end is up. The way she speaks so highly of science (and herself), I am surprised she hasn't got the second one yet, but the surprise will be all hers when she does. Anybody have stiff painful neck muscles that run from about the top of your back/shoulder area all the way up to the base of your skull? I've had that on my right side for about 3 months. Gives me a constant dull headache on the right side and I think may be contributing to my tinnitus. It's very painful. My uncle this same problem after his 3rd dose his went away after a month ..he just took Tylenol and Advil and went about his day. An example: this winter he did some ice fishing put up an ice hut..then it just went away. Thanks for the reply. I don't quite follow the \"ice fishing\" analogy though. I had this. They were visibly swollen and so stiff. Neck and shoulders all the way up to the base of the spine as far as I could feel. My husband said it felt like steel. I was also having migraines and dizziness. I bought a neck massager off Amazon. It really helped. I had to use it everyday and it was sore but it seemed to loosen it up and made me feel like my brain was finally getting some blood. That's how it felt. Massage it. Get someone to massage it. I know exactly what you're talking about. I specifically have mentioned this symptom before. It can get better.

I'm glad to hear that you were able to resolve this issue. Question: Did your tight neck/shoulder muscles cause any tinnitus for you? No tinnitus. Nothing above occasional that last only a few seconds. My muscles still tighten up more than normal and my neck cracks all the time. I wouldn't say resolved but definitely not swollen like it was. My entire body was swollen for months. All of my bllodwork was perfect tho so my doctor was baffled. I was dizzy and felt like I had medicine head. When the swelling went down, it helped. Ice it. Massage it. Then heat it. Get the swelling down. Imo. "}
