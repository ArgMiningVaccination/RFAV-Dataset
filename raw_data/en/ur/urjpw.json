Naturopathic Physicians are trained to look at the whole person when diagnosing and treating the patient. Illnesses are looked at as an imbalance within the energy and mechanics of the human body. Finding the root cause of the imbalance and treating the root cause will re-establish optimal health. The Physical, Emotional, Mental, and Spiritual aspects of a person's life all play a unique role in health and illness. In order to achieve optimal health, and eliminate illness, it is necessary to balance all of these aspects. Naturopathic Physicians teach patientshow to achieve this by formulating individual treatment plans designed for each person's lifestyle and health goals. More natural forms of medicines are used to design these treatment plans. These natural forms of medicines include, but are not limited to; botanicals, homeopathy, nutritional supplements, physical medicines such as acupuncture and naturopathic manipulation, dietary changes, Bach Flower Essences, and lifestyle counseling. Naturopathic Physicians undergo rigorous training in accredited four year post graduate naturopathic medical programs. As physicians, they are trained to evaluate and diagnose illnesses as do conventional medical doctors. They implore the use of lab testing, physical exams, and imaging studies in terms of determing a diagnosos. Naturopathic Physicians treat acute and chronic illnesses and will refer patients to a specialist or emergency care facility if the need arises. It is important for individuals to be informes about their own health and well-being, and take an active role in obtaining optimal health. More people are realizing that there are other medical options available ther than pharmaceuticals or surgery. Natural medicines, even though they are natural, are still medicines and need to be prescribed by a physician trained in their use in order to ensure safety. Naturopathic Physicians are specially trained to evaluate illnesses from a natural perspective and treat accodringly, while respecting and integrating the role of the conventioanl medical model.
