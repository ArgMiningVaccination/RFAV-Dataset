It helps to break down the stool mass but does not help in its expulsion (na tu mala patane) Difference - fresh and dry ginger Difference between fresh ginger and dry ginger (ginger powder): Ardraka - Wet Ginger - Rooksha (Dry) + Ushna (Hot) Shunti - Dry Ginger - Snigdha (unctuous, oily) + Ushna (hot) Wet ginger has dryness (Rooksha) and dry ginger has some oiliness or unctuousness in it. Wet ginger - Bhedini - can cause diarrhoea or more useful in constipation. Dry ginger - Grahi - absorbent, bowel binding, useful in IBS. It also relieves constipation, but not so useful as wet one in relieving constipation. Wet ginger - Bhedini - can cause diarrhoea or more useful in constipation. Dry ginger - Grahi - absorbent, bowel binding, useful in IBS. It also relieves constipation, but not so useful as wet one in relieving constipation. Wet ginger is usually used for a short period of time. This is because of its dryness (lack of oiliness). Dry ginger is Snigdha - unctuous, oily hence tolerable for a long period of time. Hence, it can be used for a long time. Effect of wet ginger is seen more on the stomach and intestines. Effect of dry ginger is seen both on stomach-intestines (Jatharagni) and at tissue level (Dhatvagni). Ardraka - wet ginger is called Ruksha (in the second line) - dryness. Bhavaprakasha - the second line - Snigdha - unctuous. So, dry ginger has unctuousness. Because of this unctuous quality, associated with hotness, the hotness of dry ginger lasts for a longer period of time (Consider fire, with oil as fuel, it burns longer). This is the reason, it can act in deeper tissues Hotness of wet ginger is limited for a short period of time. Because the fire in it is very dry. There is no oiliness. Hence, it acts locally on the stomach and intestine level fire (jataragni). Fresh ginger does not have unctuousness. During the process of drying, probably the hidden volatile oil principles become more active, leading to unctuousness. When it is fresh, the watery content subsides any hidden oily principles. Fresh ginger is drier when compared to dry ginger, due to lack of unctuousness (unctuousness and dryness are opposite qualities). Because fresh ginger is more dry, the fire is also very dry, hence, the intensity is strong but lasts only for a shorter period of time. When there is oiliness along with hotness, the intensity of fire is sustained for a longer period of time. Side effects In case of skin disorders, anemia, dysuria, bleeding disorders, non healing wounds, fever, while having burning sensation, during summer and in spring, fresh ginger should be avoided. It is safe to use ginger in low amounts during pregnancy and lactation and in children. It may cause worsening of gastritis in people having sensitive stomach. Precaution with fresh ginger tea: A bit of cardamom is suggested to be added to ginger tea made with fresh ginger. or else, because of its dryness quality, it can cause throat irritation and dryness of the soft palate. This feature is especially observed in coastal areas with high Humidity. (Prof. Dr. Ranga Prasad Bhat) Contra indications supplements Can this be used while taking Homeopathic medicine? Yes.
