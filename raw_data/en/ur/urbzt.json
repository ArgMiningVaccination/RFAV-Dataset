We co-detected these transcripts in specific respiratory, corneal and intestinal epithelial cells, potentially explaining the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These genes are co-expressed in nasal epithelial cells with genes involved in innate immunity, highlighting the cells' potential role in initial viral infection, spread and clearance. The study offers a useful resource for further lines of inquiry with valuable clinical samples from COVID-19 patients and we provide our data in a comprehensive, open and user-friendly fashion at www.covid19cellatlas.org. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Detection of the virus was first reported in Wuhan2, China and has since spread worldwide, emerging as a global pandemic3. In symptomatic patients, nasal swabs have yielded higher viral loads than throat swabs4. The same distribution was observed in an asymptomatic patient4, implicating the nasal epithelium as a portal for initial infection and transmission. Cellular entry of coronavi - ruses depends on the binding of the spike (S) protein to a specific cellular receptor and subsequent S protein priming by cellular proteases. Similarly to SARS-CoV 5,6, SARS-CoV-2 employs ACE2 as a receptor for cellular entry. The binding affinity of the S pro - tein and ACE2 was found to be a major determinant of SARS-CoV replication rate and disease severity 4,7. Viral entry also depends on TMPRSS2 protease activity and cathepsin B/L activity may be able to substitute for TMPRSS2 7. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have been detected in both nasal and bron - chial epithelium by immunohistochemistry8. Gene expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 has been reported to occur largely in alveolar epithelial type II cells9-11, which are central to SARS-CoV pathogenesis, whereas a different study reported the absence of ACE2 in the upper airway12. To clarify the expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, we ana - lyzed their expression and the expression of other genes potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis at cellular resolution, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy donors generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium and other resources to inform and prioritize the use of precious, limited clinical material that is becoming available from COVID-19 patients. We investigated gene expression of ACE2 in multiple scRNA-seq datasets from different tissues, including those of the respiratory tree, cornea, retina, esophagus, ileum, colon, heart, skeletal muscle, spleen, liver, placenta/decidua, kidney, testis, pancreas, prostate gland, brain, skin and fetal tissues. We note that studies may lack specific cell types due to their sparsity, the challenges associated with isolation or analysis methodology. Moreover, expression may be under-detected due to technical dropout effects. Thus, while positive (presence) results are highly reliable, absence should be interpreted with care. ACE2 expression was generally low in all analyzed datasets. Consistently with independent studies 10,11, ACE2 was expressed in cells from multiple tissues, including airways, cornea, esophagus, ileum, colon, liver, gallbladder, heart, kidney and testis (Fig. 1a; first column). TMPRSS2 was highly expressed with a broader distribu - tion (Fig. 1a; second column), suggesting that ACE2, rather than TMPRSS2, may be a limiting factor for viral entry at the initial infec - tion stage. Cells from the respiratory tree, cornea, esophagus, ileum, colon, gallbladder and common bile duct expressed both genes in the same cell (Fig. 1a; third column). We also assessed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in developmental datasets from fetal tissues, including liver, thymus, skin, bone marrow, yolk sac and lung, and found little to no expression of ACE2 in all but fetal liver and thymus (Fig. 1a) where there was no co-expression with TMPRSS2 (data not shown) except for a cluster of medullary thymic epithelial cells (Fig. 1a). ACE2 expression is noticeable in certain cell types in pla - centa/decidua without TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1a). Additional fetal data across relevant tissues and stages are needed to determine the gen - erality of these findings. To further characterize specific epithelial cell types expressing ACE2, we evaluated ACE2 expression within the lung and airway SARS-CoV-2 entry factors are highly expressed in nasal epithelial cells together with innate immune genes Waradon Sungnak L. Barnes11 and HCA Lung Biological Network* NATuRe MeDiCiNe | VOL 26 | MAy 2020 | 681-687 | www.nature.com/naturemedicine 681Brief CommuniC ation NATuRE MEDICINEepithelium. We found that, despite a low level of expression over - all, ACE2 was expressed in multiple epithelial cell types across the airway, as well as in alveolar epithelial type II cells in the paren - chyma, consistently with previous studies9-11. Notably, nasal epithe - lial cells, including two previously described clusters of goblet cells and one cluster of ciliated cells, show the highest expression among all investigated cells in the respiratory tree (Fig. 1b). We confirmed enriched ACE2 expression in nasal epithelial cells in an independent scRNA-seq study that includes nasal brushings and biopsies. The results were consistent; we found the highest expression of ACE2 in nasal secretory cells (equivalent to the two goblet cell clusters in the previous dataset) and ciliated cells (Fig. 1b). In addition, scRNA-seq data from an in vitro epithelial regen - eration system from nasal epithelial cells corroborated the - sion of ACE2 in goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells in air-liquid interface cultures (Extended Data Fig. 1). Notably, the differenti - ating cells in the air-liquid interface acquire progressively more ACE2 (Extended Data Fig. 1). The results also suggest that this in vitro culture system may be biologically relevant for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. It is worth noting that TMPRSS2 was only expressed in a subset of ACE2 + cells (Extended Data Fig. 2), suggesting that the virus might use alternative pathways. It was previously shown that SARS-CoV-2 could enter TMPRSS2 cells using cathepsin B/L7. Indeed, other proteases were more promiscuously expressed than TMPRSS2, especially cathepsin B, which was expressed in more than 70-90% of ACE2 + cells (Extended Data Fig. 2). However, while TMPRSS2 activity is documented to be important for viral transmission13,14, the potential of cathepsin B/L or other proteases to functionally replace TMPRSS2 has not been determined. We next asked whether enriched expression of viral receptors and entry-associated molecules in the nasal region/upper airway might be relevant for viral transmissibility. Here, we assessed the expression of viral receptor genes that are used by other coronavi - ruses and influenza viruses in our datasets. We looked for ANPEP, used by HCoV-22944 (ref. 15) and DPP4 , used by MERS-CoV45 (ref. 16), as well as enzymes ST6GAL1 and ST3GAL4, which are important for the synthesis of (2,6)-linked and (2,3)-linked sialic acids recognized by influenza viruses17. Notably, their expression distribution coincided with viral transmissibility patterns based on a comparison to the basic reproduction number (R 0), which estimates the number of people who can become infected from a single infected person. The skewed distribution of the recep - tors/enzymes toward the upper airway is observed in viruses with higher R 0/infectivity, including those of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 (R0 ~1.4-5.0 and HCoV-229E (unidentified R0; associated with common cold). This distribution is in distinct contrast with that of DPP4 , the receptor for MERS-CoV (R0 ~0.3-0.8 (ref. 22)), coronavirus with limited which expression skews toward lower airway/lung parenchyma (Fig. 2a). Therefore, our data highlight the possibility that viral transmissibility is dependent on the spatial distribution of receptor accessibility along the respiratory tract. To gain more insight into the expression patterns of genes associated with ACE2, we performed Spearman's correlation analysis with Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P values to identify genes associated with ACE2 across all cells within the lung epi - thelial cell datasets. While the correlation coefficients are rela - tively low (< 0.12), likely due to low expression of ACE2, technical noise and dropout effects, the expression pattern of the top 50 ACE2-correlated genes across the respiratory tree is consistent with that of ACE2, with a skewed expression toward upper air - way cells (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Notably, while some of the genes are associated with carbohydrate metabolism, possibly due to their role in goblet cell mucin synthesis, a num - ber of genes associated with immune functions including innate and antiviral immune functions, are over-represented in the rank list, including IDO1, IRAK3, NOS2, TNFSF10, OAS1 and MX1 (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 1). Expression of these genes is highest in nasal goblet 2 cells (Fig. 2b), consistent with the pheno - type previously described. Nonetheless, nasal goblet 1 and nasal ciliated 2 cells also significantly express these genes (Fig. 2b). Given their environmental exposure and high expression of recep - tor/receptor-associated enzymes (Fig. 2a), it is plausible that nasal epithelial cells are conditioned to express these immune-associated genes to reduce viral susceptibility. In this study, we explored multiple scRNA-seq datasets gener - ated within the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium and other resources and found that the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and viral entry-associated protease TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in nasal goblet and ciliated cells. This finding implicates these cells as loci of original infection and possible reservoirs for dissemina - tion within and between individuals. Co-expression in other bar - rier surface tissues could also suggest further investigation into alternative transmission routes. For example, the co-expression in esophagus, ileum and colon could explain viral fecal shedding observed clinically 24, with implications for potential fecal-oral transmission, whereas the co-expression in superficial conjunctival cells could explain an ocular phenotype observed in a small por - tion of COVID-19 patients25 with the potential of spread through the nasolacrimal duct. The results confirmed the expression of ACE2 in multiple tis - sues shown in previous studies10,11 with added information on tissues not previously investigated, including nasal epithelium and cornea and its co-expression with TMPRSS2.

The standard scanpy (v.1.4.3) clustering procedure was followed. When batch information was available, the harmony package was used to correct batch effects in the principal component space and the corrected principal components were used for computing nearest-neighbor graphs. To re-annotate the cells, multiple clusterings of different resolutions were generated among which the one best matching published clustering was picked and manual annotation was undertaken using marker genes described in the original publication. Full details can be found in analysis notebooks available at github.com/Teichlab/covid19_MS1. Illustration of the results was generated using scanpy and Seurat (v.3.1). For correlation analysis with ACE2, we performed Spearman's correlation with statistical tests using the R Hmisc package (v.4.3-1) and P values were adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg method with the R stats package (v.3.6.1) on the Vieira Braga et al. 26 airway epithelial dataset and the Deprez et al.27 airway dataset. We also tested multiple additional approaches, including Kendall's correlation, data transformation by sctransform function in the Seurat package and data imputation by the Markov affinity-based graph imputation of cells algorithm to compare correlation results. While imputation significantly improved correlations, the top genes correlated with ACE2 are largely the same as the analysis performed on un-imputed data. With the uncertainty of the extent that imputation artificially distorted the data, we reported results with no imputation, even though correlations were low. The correlation coefficients for all genes are included as Supplementary Data 1. The top 50 genes in each dataset were characterized based on gene ontology classes from the Gene Ontology database and associated pathways in PathCards were from the Pathway Unification database.

Epithelial regeneration system from nasal epithelial cells was used for in vitro cultures on successive days (7, 12 and 28), resulting in different epithelial cell types along differentiation trajectory characterized in Ruiz Garc\u00eda et al. 2019. The cultures were differentiated in Pneumacult media. Schematic illustration depicts the respective cell types in the differentiation trajectory, and the dot plot illustrates the cultured cell types along the differentiation pseudotime, along with their respective location within the epithelial layers. For gene expression results in the dot plot: the dot size represents the proportion of cells within the respective cell type expressing the gene and the dot color represents the average gene expression level within the particular cell type.
