They include a history of severe allergic reactions, pericarditis, or endocarditis following a prior COVID-19 vaccine. People considering a [COVID-19 vaccine](/articles/how-did-we-develop-a-covid-19-vaccine-so-quickly) may worry about complications and side effects. Yet for almost all individuals, the known risks of getting COVID-19 far outweigh any potential risks of the COVID-19 vaccine. For people with chronic health conditions or other medical conditions that weaken their immune system, the risks of COVID-19 are even higher. The list of medical reasons not to get a vaccine is short, but some other groups may be eligible for a vaccine exemption. No single vaccine exemption applies to everyone in all contexts \u2014 instead, exemption eligibility depends on the entity from which a person seeks an exemption. Read on to learn about the few medical reasons not to get the COVID-19 vaccine. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our [coronavirus hub](/coronavirus) for the most recent information on COVID-19. A small number of people cannot safely get the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#contraindications) Additionally, people with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis following the vaccine should take precautions when choosing follow-up or booster doses, the CDC says. These individuals should contact a doctor to discuss their options. Some groups, such as people who have a history of a mild to moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine, may still benefit from the vaccine. It is important for these people to discuss the risks and benefits of the vaccine with a doctor. Chronic medical conditions, pregnancy, cancer, and other conditions are not a reason to avoid the [COVID-19 vaccine](/articles/type-1-diabetes-covid-vaccine), according to the CDC. In fact, for many people with health conditions, the risk of adverse effects from COVID-19 makes it particularly important to get vaccinated. A medical exemption means that a person is not required to get a [COVID-19 vaccine](/articles/coronavirus-vaccine). Because no national or state-level vaccine requirement exists, medical exemptions apply to specific scenarios only. For example, only a small number of people are eligible for an air travel exemption. Many school systems, on the other hand, do not require the COVID-19 vaccine at all. Others allow a person to assert a religious or personal belief exemption, according to the [National Conference of State Legislatures](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx). The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#contraindications) - Allergy to the COVID-19 vaccine: A person who has had a severe allergic reaction, such as [anaphylaxis](/articles/216062), to a prior COVID-19 vaccine should not receive that same vaccine again. For a person with a mild or moderate allergic reaction, the benefits still usually outweigh the risks. - Allergy to COVID-19 vaccine components: A person who has a known allergy or a history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of a COVID-19 vaccine should not receive any vaccine containing that ingredient. - History of allergic reaction to other vaccines: The CDC does not recommend avoiding COVID-19 vaccination for most people who have had an allergic reaction to another vaccine, even when the reaction has been severe. - Moderate or severe illness: People who have a current acute illness, such as an infection or the flu, should delay vaccination until their symptoms go away. - History of MIS-C or MIS-A: A person with a history of [multisystem inflammatory syndrome](/articles/covid-19-rare-inflammatory-syndrome-in-children-examined-in-new-study)should still consider vaccination if it has been 90 days or longer since their symptoms went away. A person should talk with a doctor about the timing of the vaccine if that person is still undergoing treatment. - Myocarditis or pericarditis: A person with a history of [myocarditis](/articles/myocarditis)or [pericarditis](/articles/193320)after COVID-19 vaccination should typically not get another COVID-19 vaccine. Some workplaces or schools use this list. Others offer a wider range of exemptions that extend beyond medical reasons. These may include exceptions for religious or personal beliefs. The following conditions are not medical reasons to avoid getting a COVID-19 vaccine: - pregnancy - breastfeeding or chestfeeding - a history of illness, fever, or other mild reactions after a prior COVID-19 vaccine - an autoimmune disease - cancer - a terminal health condition A person who has a condition on the CDC list of conditions that make a vaccine unsafe will be exempt from COVID-19 vaccination. But a person might also be eligible for other, broader medical exemptions. To find out if a person is medically exempt, consider the following: - Determine which specific entity a person seeks an exemption from. For example, a person might not want to get vaccinated for work or school. - Ask for a copy of that entity's COVID-19 policy. - Check whether the person has a medical condition listed on the exemption list. Some individuals are exempt from providing proof of the vaccine for air travel, but this is not a medical exemption. This includes: - certain non-U.S. citizens, such as those seeking asylum and those with a Visa 92 or 93 - aircrew members who follow all other industry COVID-19 guidelines, such as masking People with serious underlying medical conditions have a [higher risk](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) The vaccine greatly reduces the risk of dying from COVID-19. Many of the risks of the vaccine are theoretical and based on anecdotes, not scientific evidence. Conversely, the risks of COVID-19 are significant and well-documented. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html) People have reported a total of 16,516 deaths to the Vaccine Adverse Event Recording System (VAERS). However, experts have not validated these deaths as stemming from the COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 anyone can report a death for any reason. Even if this large figure did represent the total number of deaths, the death rate associated with the vaccine would be 0.0027%. While the COVID-19 death rate [varies significantly](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33716331/) The following are answers to frequently asked questions about the COVID-19 vaccine. What if I am pregnant or nursing? People who are pregnant or have recently been pregnant have a higher risk of complications from COVID-19. The CDC recommends that pregnant people get vaccinated and advises that pregnancy and nursing do not increase the risk of an adverse reaction. [Research from 2022](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2789947) What if I have an autoimmune condition? The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html) What if I have cancer? People with cancer [have a higher risk](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#myocarditis-pericarditis) What if I have already had COVID-19? After a COVID-19 infection, a person may have some temporary immunity. This immunity is not permanent, however, and is not as strong as immunity from a vaccine. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#:~:text=You%20may%20consider%20delaying%20your,get%20vaccinated%20after%20their%20recovery.) It is common to fear something new, like a vaccine, and it is a good idea to be mindful of what one puts in their body. However, COVID-19 itself is much more dangerous than any purported vaccine side effects. The vaccine provides significant protection that can save a person's life. People who have anxiety about the vaccine should talk with a healthcare professional they trust and ask about research relevant to them and their health. "}
