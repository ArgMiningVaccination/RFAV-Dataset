Well, it is not true. How does Dr Shah look at homeopathy and conventional medicine (allopathy) is, that they are two of the methods of treatment; with their own strengths and limitations? No system of medicine, yet, is complete and perfect. There are many diseases, which can be treated by homeopathy alone, without the help of any other modes of treatment. The examples include: - Eczema - Urticaria - Lichen - IBS - Molluscum Contagiosa - ADHD - Autism - Allergies - And more There are many diseases, which can be managed by conventional medicines alone. For example: - High blood pressure - Diabetes - Rheumatoid Arthritis - Ulcerative colitis - Tuberculosis - HIV - Some forms of cancer - Asthma - Many infections - Gout - Malaria - Typhoid - Pneumonia - Epilepsy - And more. There are many diseases, which are better treated if both the systems of medicines are thoughtfully integrated. The examples are: - Recurrent Tonsillitis - Psoriatic Arthritis - Rheumatoid Arthritis - HIV - Hepatitis C - Ulcerative colitis - Peptic Ulcer - Ankylosing Spondylitis - Depression - Anxiety Neurosis - Autism - Diabetes Neuropathy - Some forms of cancer - Some chronic infections like fungal infections - Meniere disease - Bronchial Asthma - Underactive thyroid - And many more. Are homeopathy and conventional medicine enemies? How can they be? It is imprudent to think like that. Some homeopathic and allopathic doctors might consider each other in opposition. It is their shortsightedness. Dr Shah believes that Computer Engineering and Mechanical Engineering cannot be opponents of each other, and they work complementing each other; so as do homeopathy and any other system of medicine. Belonging t It is a duty of the attending physician who may be belonging to any system of medicine, to advocate for the patient whatever is best indicated to the patient's benefit, depending on the nature of the disease. For this, it is imperative that all doctors have proper knowledge and orientation about all the systems of medicine. Time will come if any doctor missing on advising homeopathy for certain diseases, will be a case of medical negligence. "}
