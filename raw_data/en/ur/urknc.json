Looking for a different approach to your health care? Alternative medicine, on the other hand, uses a number of products and practices that are not necessarily standard in Western medicine. Demystifying acupuncture\u2014it's definitely not magic Although acupuncture is not yet fully understood by Western science, research suggests Acupuncture can help relieve pain and is used in treating other illnesses worldwide. An acupuncturist gently inserts very, very thin needles into the skin at various points, and in combinations, that stimulate nerves, muscles and connective tissue and increase blood flow. This triggers the body's natural painkillers. This practice, originating in ancient China over 3,000 years ago is part of the holistic system of healing called Traditional Chinese Medicine and is now widely accepted in Western culture. Sterile, single-use, disposable needles are the standard practice and the risks are low if you choose a practitioner that has the proper training and credentials. Chinese medicine is all about optimal health. Chinese medicine encompasses many different traditions and modalities of healing.
