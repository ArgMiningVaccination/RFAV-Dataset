Scientific Evidence for Revive Daily Revive Daily claims that 16 studies have been published on the References page confirming the benefits of the formula. It also lists the ingredients and dosages upfront. This makes it easier to compare Revive Daily to other natural sleep aids and to verify that it works. Below, we'll look at some evidence to show how Revive Daily can offer science-backed benefits for sleep. Melatonin has been a well-known ingredient in natural sleep aids. Supplements can contain anywhere from 0.5 to 10mg of melatonin per serve, making Revive Daily's 10mg of Melatonin seem high. The effectiveness of melatonin in reducing sleepiness has been demonstrated at dosages ranging from 0.5mg to 10mg. The 2014 Nutrition Journal study found that melatonin may be able to support sleep for some people but not for others. Although there was limited evidence that melatonin could help shift workers adjust to hormonal phase shift changes in shift workers, some people still use melatonin every night to fall asleep. Larginine is one of Revive Daily's most essential ingredients. Revive Daily contains 1,200mg of L-arginine in each serving. Multiple studies have linked L-arginine to sleep, proving its usefulness in everything from bodybuilding supplements to sleeping aids. Researchers found that people suffering from sleep apnea had lower levels of L-arginine in their blood than those without it. Researchers believe that L-arginine may play a role in sleep quality. Researchers also found that a separate study found that L-arginine improved slow wave sleep and decreased waking in rats. However, rats didn't experience any change in rapid eye movement (REMS) sleep. Ashwagandha has been a traditional herbal remedy for centuries to promote health, well-being, and sleep. Research has shown that ashwagandha can be used to help your body cope with mental and physical stressors. Ashwagandha, a natural root extract, is believed to have GABAergic activity that can impact sleep. In studies, researchers found a link between ashwagandha supplementation, quality sleep, and sleep-deprived rats. L-theanine is a natural substance found in green tea and other natural substances. L-theanine is often taken to counter the effects of caffeine, such as anxiety and jitters. Researchers found that taking 200mg of L-theanine before going to bed was associated with better sleep quality in a 2015 study. L-theanine was not found to cause daytime sleepiness, according to researchers. Revive Daily also contains tryptophan (5HTP), zinc, and magnesium. These ingredients are essential for supporting your body's natural sleep cycles. For example, a 2012 Journal of Research in Medical Sciences found that magnesium was a GABA agonist, which plays a crucial role in regulating sleep. Researchers instructed 46 patients over 60 to take 500mg or a placebo every day for eight weeks to test the theory. Researchers found that magnesium positively affected subjective measures of insomnia, such as insomnia severity (ISI), sleep efficiency, sleep time, and onset latency. Revive Daily combines some of the most well-researched and best-known sleep aids and supplements in the world. Science backs the ingredients and doses and has proven that they work in multiple ways to support sleep. What do customer reviews say?
