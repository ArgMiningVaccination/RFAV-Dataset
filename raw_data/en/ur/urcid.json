Even if you have not recently vaccinated your pet, the symptoms that you are seeing, whether it is skin issues or digestive issues & more, may still be the result of a previous vaccine and Anti-Vaccinosis can be beneficial to your pet. Research from Dr Ronald Schulz shows that many animals maintain adequate protection for 8 years and possibly lifetime after they have gotten their puppy shots and have established antibodies. Consider annual Titer testing to make sure your pet has adequate antibodies. Our pets' immune systems are severely damaged and chronic disease can arise when our pets are being over-vaccinated. Their bodies are being forced to respond to a vaccine to which they have already established antibodies, this can lead to many health issues, consider using Anti-Vaccinosis to help reduce the impact vaccinations have on your pet.

Frequently asked questions Will this interfere with medications and vaccinations? Anti-Vaccinosis contains homeopathic remedies that are widely known to help reduce and clear the effects of the carriers used in vaccines without removing any of the \"benefits\" of the vaccines themselves. How many times can I repeat the cycle? As long as you are seeing positive results, you can repeat the cycle once a month to once a week. If you are giving it weekly it should not be repeated for longer than 1 month. After 1 month you can go to once per month but only as long as each time your animal is getting better. How do I clean the pump if it contacts the mouth of my pet? You can wipe the pump down with alcohol on a clean paper towel. If I am using the Leaky Gut Protocol, is there a benefit to repeating the Anti Vaccinosis? Yes there is. You would be repeating because you are getting benefits ongoing with each repetition. Often the reason this happens is that a large portion of the chronic issue has been from over-vaccination. CAN i give anti-vaccinosis to my horse? Horses actually get more vaccines than dogs, so it's great for horses. Anti-vaccinosis works just as well with horses as cats and dogs. why we love Adored beast!
