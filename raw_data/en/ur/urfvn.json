from the city of Seattle, is a progressive, accredited, nonprofit uni-versity, internationally recognized as a pioneer in the study of natural health arts and science education and research. Since its inception, the University has based its educational, clinical and research programs on the following key principles: Treatment of the whole person Prevention of disease Teaching patients how to take responsibility for their own health Enhancing each individual's inherent healing ability, using natural, nontoxic therapies Over the years the University has broadened its mission to integrate Western scientific standards with traditional natural healing methods from around the world. The University has expanded and strengthened the academic and clinical education of naturopathic medicine practitioners. It has developed unique aca-demic degree programs in acupuncture and Oriental medicine, nutrition, exercise science and wellness, herbal sciences, culinary arts, midwifery, integrated human biology, and counseling and health psychology, as well as specialized nondegree programs that reflect its founding philosophy. The education of graduate natural health practi- tioners and highly qualified undergraduate students at Bastyr University emphasizes development of the scientific understanding of the structure and function of the human body and the disease process, bal-anced with a profound appreciation for, and ability to activate, the unique self-healing ability inherent in every human being. The University's educational approach is an integrated one, offering traditional didactic instruction combined with innovative and interdisciplinary problem-based learning in rigorous academic and clinical environments. The learning experience emphasizes academic excellence, the development of individual talents and mastery of critical competencies. Students learn under the guidance of outstanding faculty. More than 90 percent of the University's health sciences core faculty members have earned terminal degrees, and many are successful private practitioners who contribute a wealth of practical experience to classroom and clinical instruction. Laboratory experiments, demonstrations, clinical experience and case-oriented instruction help stu-dents develop practical, patient-oriented skills and understanding. Student clinicians are also trained to recognize when other modes of treatment are in the best interests of the patient and to make appropriate referrals to colleagues in other health care professions. Bastyr University is dedicated to educating indi- viduals to meet the health and well-being needs of the 21 st century. Through practice and research, Ba- styr graduates will further develop ways to integrate scientific and traditional healing methods in support of the innate healing power of the individual as part of the greater human community. BAStyr univerSity viSion StAteMent As the world's leading academic center for advanc- ing and integrating knowledge in the natural health arts and sciences, Bastyr University will transform the health and well-being of the human community. BAStyr univerSity MiSSion StAteMent We educate future leaders in the natural health arts and sciences. Respecting the healing power of nature and recognizing that body, mind and spirit are intrinsi-cally inseparable, we model an integrated approach to education, research and clinical service. BAStyr univerSity vAlueS CompassionCommunityIntegrityConnection to NatureWhole Systems Health BAStyr univerSity core theMeS As an accredited university, Bastyr engages in an on-going self-assessment of its programs, student success, faculty, staff, physical capacity, long-term planning and resources. That process involves the development of core themes and goals that are used to characterize the University's priorities and provide the framework for continuous improvement. The University's core themes and goals are: Core Theme One\u2014Academic AchievementGeneral Information4 General InformatIon ~ I ntroductIon Goal A - Bastyr University offers a rigorous and relevant curriculum. Goal B - Bastyr University has a highly quali- fied faculty with excellent teaching skills. Goal C - Bastyr University supports student success and program completion. Core Theme 2: Research in the Natural Health Arts and Sciences Goal A - Faculty are encouraged and supported to pursue research/scholarly activity and dis- seminate findings. Goal B - Students are encouraged to participate in research training/scholarly activity. Core Theme 3: Clinical T raining and Commu- nity Health Goal A - All clinical programs provide clinical training that prepares competent entry-level health professionals. Goal B - All clinical programs provide high- quality services to the community. Core Theme 4: Interdisciplinary Integration Goal A - Students gain the knowledge, skills and attitudes to work collaboratively with peers and others in a variety of health pro-fessions. These four core themes align well with the Bastyr University mission statement: \"We educate future leaders in the natural health arts and sciences. Respecting the healing power of nature and recog-nizing that body, mind and spirit are intrinsically inseparable, we model an integrated approach to education, research and clinical service.\" Education, research and clinical services constitute the founda-tion upon which Bastyr University stands, and the interdisciplinary integration of these three primary areas of focus describes the approach the University uses to achieve mission fulfillment. BAStyr univerSity StrAtegic plAn To fulfill its mission and vision and fully meet core theme objectives, the University must think and act strategically. Following a campus-wide, itera-tive and broadly inclusive process, the University's Board of T rustees in December 2008 adopted and committed itself to the following core strategic initiatives: Strategic Initiative #1: Convene essential gen- erative conversations that inform the cultivation of practitioners and influence policy decisions that contribute to restoring the world's intrinsic health. Strategic Initiative #2: Determine what academic programs are essential to a robust and universal education in the natural health arts and sciences and ensure that each program is focused on the achievement of excellence. Strategic Initiative #3: Attract, support and retain world-class faculty and staff in the natural health arts and sciences. Strategic Initiative #4: Attract, support and retain world-class students representing different cultures. Strategic Initiative #5: Our methods of and access to instruction are innovative enough to attract the most diverse and qualified students, while maintain-ing the highest standards of academic, research and clinical excellence. Strategic Initiative #6: Establish a secure base of financial support and appropriate physical assets so we can invest in and support those things that ensure we will always lead the way in education, research and clinical practice of the natural health arts and sciences. Bastyr University has played a key part in es- tablishing the credibility of science-based natural medicine and initiating the current transformation of the health care system. In order to retain the Uni-versity's leadership role in promoting the benefits of natural medicine, we will continue to improve and transform the institution into a fully developed, well- financed mature academic center for the natural health arts and sciences. gloBAl coMpetencieS At BAStyr univerSity Bastyr University has developed global competen- cies in three major areas to help students succeed in their chosen fields in the natural health arts and sciences. These three major areas are communication skills, critical thinking and professional behavior. Students fulfill these global competencies through the curriculum of their chosen programs and in their interactions with the Bastyr community. If students are having difficulties with any of the global compe- tencies, they are encouraged to seek assistance from their instructors and the T utoring Center. Faculty members may recommend remediation for students as appropriate. Communication Skills: Five global competen- cies are listed under communication skills: writing, listening, speaking, information literacy and public speaking. Critical Thinking: Six global competencies are listed under critical thinking: synthesis and integration, reflective evaluation, problem solving, analytical skills, intuitive skills, and research skills. Professional Behavior: Five global competencies are listed under professional behavior: medical and professional ethics, compassionate caring behaviors, 5 General InformatIon ~ I ntroductIon respectful communication, personal health and well- ness, and professional boundary skills. legAl Structure of BAStyr univerSity Bastyr University is a nonprofit, tax-exempt corporation founded for the purpose of serving as an effective leader in the improvement of the health and well-being of the human community through education, research and community health care. The Articles of Incorporation are filed in the state of Washington.

Students the Student Body Bastyr University students constitute a diverse group of learners. The average age of the 1,018 stu-dents enrolled at the University in the fall of 2011 was 31, with a range in age from 18 to 69. The demographics across various programs are fairly similar. More than three-quarters of the stu-dents are women. About half of the student body is from the Pacific Northwest, and in fall 2011, 47 U.S. states were represented. International students are an important part of the Bastyr community. In 2011-2012, 76 foreign national students, represent-ing 28 countries, were enrolled. Student pArticip Ation The major focus of student participation is the Bastyr University Student Council. The council determines how student activity fees are spent, ap-points students to various committees, represents student interests to the administration and allied professional organizations, and continually seeks to promote the University and meet the needs of students. The Student Council, like the University as a whole, relies upon student participation to create a more effective learning environment. The Student Council's constitution may be found online at MyBU. The Student Council hosts numerous events during the year, including potluck dinners, dances, a talent show, graduation parties and Bastyr Com-munity Day. The council has made significant contributions to the University, including sponsor-ing community events, remodeling the movement room and sponsoring the student exercise room, providing remote viewing for some classrooms, as well as equipment for the library and other Univer-sity departments.Each student is required to pay a $25 student activity fee every quarter. These funds are adminis-tered by the Student Council and used to support student activities, organizations, programs and services. With these funds, events like Bastyr Com-munity Day, expansion of the herb garden, and free or partially-subsidized concerts, lectures and workshops are made available to students. The funds are also used to purchase equipment for the University for general student body use, such as additional computers for the library, a laptop with LCD projector and video equipment. The Student Council recognizes official student organizations. In the past several years these orga-nizations have included the following: 12-Step GroupAction AfricaAmerican Association of Naturopathic Physicians Rock HealthWashington Association of Naturopathic Physicians (WANP) Yoga Club7 General InformatIon ~ S tudent affaIrS Student Affairs The division of student affairs at Bastyr University provides support and services for students to meet personal and professional goals. The student affairs staff at Bastyr University consists of the dean of students' office, admissions, fi-nancial aid, the registrar's office, the Student Resource Center, student housing, the Counseling Center, the T utoring Center, marketing and media, career and alumni services, as well as services for international and veteran students and students who access services under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Student Policies and Procedures are available online at MyBU. deAn of Student S/vice preSident for Student AffAirS The dean of students' office supervises student affairs and professional staff, plans and conducts orientation and commencement activities, advises student organizations, oversees the Student Resource Center, facilitates communications within and among the University's constituencies, and resolves grievances. office of AdMiSSionS The Office of Admissions works with all prospec- tive students for degree and certificate programs at the University. In addition, the admissions office coordinates campus tours, information sessions, webinars, campus visits and off-campus events to highlight the academic opportunities at the University. regiStrA tion The Office of the Registrar maintains student aca- demic records, manages course scheduling, handles academic registration and evaluation, records grades, produces transcripts and grade reports, and provides academic advising and evaluation. The office also provides American with Disabilities Act services, tutoring services, international and veteran student services. Bastyr University operates on the quarter system. The University's quarter is 11 weeks long. (Summer quarter classes are generally eight weeks; summer clinic is 11 weeks.) Eleven hours of class constitute one credit hour, and 22 hours of lab/practicum constitute one credit hour. Continuing students preregister for courses and clinic shifts by submitting a preregistration form. The preregistration forms must be received before the Office of the Registrar will register a student for classes or clinic shifts. Registration for continuing students takes place in the spring for summer and fall quarters and in the fall for winter and spring quarters. New students are automatically registered for their fall quarter courses, beginning in late spring and after they have paid their confirmation deposit. Nonmatriculated students may register for courses after matriculated students have been registered. Priority for courses is given to matricu-lated students. Students taking a course that is required for their major have preference over those taking the course as an elective. If a student has withdrawn from her/his program, s/he may take subsequent program courses only with permission from the dean of the school from which the student has withdrawn. Students may elect to audit a course or change their status in a course from grade to audit beginning the first week of the quarter through the second week of the quarter. However, after the first week of the quarter, standard refund policies apply. After the second week, a student may not change from a graded option to an au - dit option or from an audit option to a graded option. Course add/drop forms are available on MyBU. Classes may be added or dropped from a student's schedule through the add/drop period (ending the close of the first week of each quarter). After the first week of the quarter, all withdrawals will be noted with a \"W\" grade on the transcript (except in the case of weekend intensive classes or non-traditionally scheduled classes that have not yet begun). Assigned clinic shifts may be traded during the shift change period. Elective clinic shifts may be added during that same period. Clinic shift drops are accompanied by financial penalties. (Please see the Office of the Registrar for additional information.) Withdrawal from classes is not permitted during the final three weeks of a quarter (see the financial policies section for the refund policy and last page 155 for a refund schedule). For courses with concentrated scheduling (not evenly spaced throughout a quarter), the timing of additions or drops varies. (In no case may students drop or withdraw from a course after the course has ended.) Students must check with the registrar for specific deadlines. finAnciAl Aid Prospective students, current students and alumni all work with the financial aid office on financial planning for their education. Students have access to a full range of state and federal financial aid programs. The financial aid office also distributes 8 General InformatIon ~ S tudent affaIrS information about a wide variety of private scholar- ships available throughout the academic year.

The Student Health Plan is a well-ness plan offered through Bastyr Center for Natural Health. It is not an insurance plan so students are encouraged to individually obtain health insurance to cover themselves while students at the University. U.S. students are not required to carry health insur-ance but are strongly advised to do so. The insurance requirements for international students are included in materials sent directly to international students. The University does not carry insurance on stu- dent health or property.

Bastyr is not responsible for providing transportation for students to clinic shifts, internships, jobs, social events, volunteer service activities or any other off-campus activity. Students are responsible for making their own travel arrangements and for all associated costs and risks.

Once orientation begins, this fee is nonrefundable. 5Nonrefundable course deposits are required when confirmed enrollment is essential prior to the start of a given quarter. Amount varies depending on the course.pArking And trAnSport Ation All students and employees at all Bastyr locations, including adjunct faculty, are required to register their transportation choices, whether driving a car or not. This must be done either online or by paper form within two weeks of the start of the student or employee's first quarter. This information allows us to manage our parking availability, give incen-tives to carpoolers, track our carbon footprint and offer several services such as quarterly bike rentals. In addition, we have a shuttle service on weekdays throughout each quarter between the main campus and Bastyr Center for Natural Health. Campus parking fees are $48/quarter for those who park on campus three or more days per week. Parking two days or less per week costs $24 per quarter. Carpooling two or more times per week is also $24 per quarter. Parking one day or less per week is free. These fees help defray the large expenses of build- ing and maintaining our parking stalls. Automatic inclusion of parking fees with tuition or by payroll deduction is strongly preferred, but payment by cash or check is accepted if automatic deduction is not possible. Parking citations range from $10 to $100 depend- ing on the seriousness of the infraction. Citations are generally given to those who have not registered their transportation information, those who do not have current Bastyr identification on their cars and those who are incorrectly parked. Parking fines are due within two weeks. After two weeks, the fine is automatically charged to the student's account. For more information on transportation and parking issues, please see the facilities section on MyBU. other coSt S Books and supplies cost approximately $700 to $2,500 a year, depending upon the program of study. Naturopathic medicine students are required to purchase diagnostic equipment by week one of winter quarter of their first year when enrolling in Clinical Skills Lab 2 at an estimated cost of $1,000-$3,000. living expenSe fund diSBurSeMent of finAnciAl Aid Bastyr University uses electronic disbursement services (EDS) to issue living expense disbursements for financial aid. Students receiving funds through financial aid for living expenses are required to General InformatIon ~ f InancIal PolIcIeS12 enroll in EDS, providing the University with ap- propriate bank account information in order to process disbursements. Disbursements will be sent to EDS participants generally within two to four business days after the first day of the quarter. If a student does not participate in the EDS program, the University will process a paper check within the regulatory time frame, which is approximately 14 days after the credit balance occurs on the student's account. refundS Dropping all classes by or before the end of the first week of classes entitles a student to a 100 per-cent tuition refund. An add/drop fee is charged after the first week has ended. Any clinic drops are accom-panied by financial penalties. (See clinic registration staff in the registrar's office for more information.) Refund calculations for drops or withdrawals from classes after the first week of the quarter are found on the last page of the catalog. For those students receiving federal financial aid, the federal calcula-tion for the return of Title IV funds is required, and refunds will be returned on behalf of the student to the federal government. Amounts are determined by federal regulations. Students who receive state financial aid may also have funds returned to the state based on each state's refund policy. Students with financial problems that will affect the payment of tuition and/or fees should contact the finance office at once to make satisfactory ar-rangements. The deadline for contesting a charge on a student account is 90 days from the close of the quarter in which the charge is applied or 90 days from the actual posting, whichever is later. Financial policies, like all policies of the Uni- versity, are subject to change and revision by the management and/or Board of T rustees of the Uni-versity. Notice of changes is published on MyBU. Facilities cAMpuS Bastyr University's primary academic and ad- ministrative facilities are located in Kenmore, Washington. The 51-acre campus adjoins Saint Ed-ward State Park (with hiking trails leading down to Lake Washington) and includes a 186,000 square-foot building, playfields and forested areas. The campus includes classrooms, research and teaching laboratories, exam rooms, an auditorium, a chapel, meeting rooms, faculty and administrative offices, General InformatIon ~ f acIlItIeS a library, a bookstore and dining commons. Visitors are encouraged to enjoy the spacious grounds, tour the herb garden and visit neighboring St. Edward State Park. A new Student Village opened in June 2010. This LEED Platinum-certified housing complex enables up to 132 students to reduce their carbon footprint by living on campus. Please see the Office of Student Affairs for more information or e-mail housing@bastyr.edu with questions. In September 2012, the University will inau- gurate a new campus in San Diego, California. Bastyr University California resides in a 19,500 square-foot, two-story, leased facility in the Sor-rento Valley. The campus includes classrooms, research labs, a library, a teaching clinic and study areas. The surrounding area includes hiking trails, coastal wilderness preserves, research facilities, and the University of California, San Diego campus and amenities. BAStyr center for nAturAl heAlth the teAching clinic of BAStyr univerSity Bastyr Center for Natural Health (Bastyr Center or BCNH) is the largest natural health clinic in the Northwest. As the teaching clinic of Bastyr University, Bastyr Center provides patient services and student training in a professional clinical setting that emphasizes a natural approach to health care. Bastyr Center serves the health care needs of a diverse patient population, which includes young people, growing families and senior citizens from throughout the Puget Sound area. Bastyr Center schedules ap-proximately 35,000 patient visits annually. Services at Bastyr Center include naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, nutrition counseling, homeopathy, mental health counseling and physical medicine. In an effort to meet the health care needs of patients and to enhance the educational experience for students, Bastyr Center provides specialized care options throughout the year. Specialized care options include an immune wellness program for people living with HIV/AIDS, ADHD treatment and wellness care, diabetes and cardiovascular wellness care, pediatric wellness care, women's wellness care, and senior wellness care. In 2006, Bastyr Center moved to a newly reno- vated building in Seattle's Fremont/Wallingford neighborhood, to provide an enhanced environment for promoting health and healing for patients, staff and students. The expanded Bastyr Center features a Chinese herbal medicine dispensary and a larger 13 natural medicine dispensary, offering a wide selec- tion of natural health care products and a variety of gift items. Bastyr Center was the first natural health care clinic in the region to receive LEED-CI Certifica-tion from the U.S. Green Building Council for compliance with high environmental standards. LEED-CI is the recognized standard for certifying high-performance green interiors that are healthy and productive places to work, less costly to operate and maintain, and have a reduced environmental footprint. The University recently obtained ad-ditional space in the building and is in the process of adding several classrooms and making other improvements. Bastyr Center is located at 3670 Stone Way North in Seattle. Parking is available onsite for patients and on the street for students, faculty and staff. For more information, please visit www.BastyrCenter.org. Bastyr University maintains several external clini- cal learning sites, creating tremendous diversity in student clinical education and experiences.

Summary policies and procedures that apply to undergraduates are described in the catalog under \"Bastyr Undergraduate Programs\" beginning on page 30. Students are advised to consult the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual, Student Policies and Procedures and current applicable modules of the Student Clinician Handbook on MyBU for complete information on all academic policies and procedures. AcAdeMic honeSty All Bastyr students are responsible for abiding by the University policy on academic honesty. Academic work is evaluated on the assumption and expectation that all work submitted for a grade is the student's own, unless designated otherwise. Present-ing another's work as one's own is unacceptable and considered academically dishonest. Cheating and plagiarism are considered forms of academic dishon - esty, and students found responsible for such acts are subject to disciplinary action, including dismissal. The policy is outlined in full in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual. General InformatIon ~ a cademIc PolIcIeS and ProcedureS14 AcAdeMic StAtuS The University uses the following terms to denote academic status: Good Standing Academic WarningProbationFinal ProbationSuspensionDismissalA student whose status is anything other than Good Standing may be required to sign a learning contract, develop an academic improvement plan and/or be held to other sanctions. In addition, students under Academic Warning, Probation or Final Probation status must complete at least two successive quarters with no academic difficulty in order to petition for a change of status. Change in status decisions are made by the student's school or department Student Progress Committee (or the dean or dean's designee). Depending on the nature of the academic deficiency, the categories above are not necessarily followed sequentially. AcAdeMic SuSpenSion policy Academic suspension is used when the dean of the school believes a student will benefit from time away from his/her program and has sufficient opportunity to be successful upon return from suspension. The terms of a suspension are unique to each student and decided by the dean. Suspension will last at least one quarter, and a student may be required to receive remedial academic assistance before being readmit-ted. Suspended students must petition the dean for reinstatement, may be required to meet with the dean, and must show that all terms of the student contract, improvement plan and/or other require-ments have been met before receiving approval to return to the University. If a student is unable to demonstrate that s/he has adequately resolved the issues that led to suspension, the student may be eligible for dismissal. Removal from a course or clinic shift may be war- ranted in the case of a student's failure to adhere to instructions, procedures and/or professional expecta-tions that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient, student, staff or faculty member. Removal from a course or clinic shift constitutes a failure of that class or shift and is not eligible for remediation. recoMMendA tionS for diSMiSSAlS Recommendations for dismissals from the University usually occur in the case of any of the following: 1. Failure to satisfactorily adhere to the terms of the established learning contract or academic improvement plan 2. Failure of the same class twice3. Failure of two clinic shifts4. Three failures in the same quarter5. A history of poor academic performance rel- evant to the appropriate department 6. Removal from a course/clinic shift in the case of student failure to adhere to instructions, procedures and/or professional expectations that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient, student or faculty/staff member diSMiSSAl policy Each school of Bastyr University has a Student Progress Committee that follows the individual school dismissal policy. Recommendations for dismissal are submitted to the provost for consider-ation. The provost will make the final decision on student dismissals. AppeAl of AcAdeMic SuSpenSion or diSMiSSAl An appeal of academic suspension or dismissal is submitted to the provost and can only be made in the event of factual error. The written appeal must be made to the provost within five working days of the date on the suspension or dismissal letter or e-mail. The appeal must specify and include the alleged docu-mented inaccuracy and the relevance of the fact(s). The provost will respond within 10 working days to an appeal of academic suspension or dismissal and can only consider an appeal based on an error of fact. The decision of the provost is final and can-not be appealed. non-AcAdeMic SepArAtion If an instructor, faculty member, clinic supervi- sor or University administrator determines that a student's behavior, performance or professional-ism on campus, in the classroom or in a clinical setting is disruptive or otherwise impeding the student's own success or the success of others, the instructor, faculty member, clinic supervisor or University administrator may take whatever steps deemed appropriate to remedy the situation up to and including requiring the student to leave the General InformatIon ~ a cademIc PolIcIeS and ProcedureS15 classroom, clinic shift and/or University property for the remainder of the day. A student who is removed from a class, clinic shift or the university property may also be subject to suspension or other discipline. liMit S on Student credit loAdS Bastyr University degree programs are described under each school or department listing in the Ba - styr University Catalog. The recommended didactic curriculum for each year and track of the degree program is specified. Elective courses and clinic credits are expected over and above the required didactic courses. Capable students may choose to exceed the full- time recommended enrollment in order to include important electives or special interests in their pro-grams. However, the following are the maximum credit loads for which students may register in each program in any given quarter: Bachelor of Science (all programs) ................. 20 credits Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology ...... 24 credits Master of Science in Midwifery (all tracks) .... 30 credits Master of Science in Nutrition (all tracks) ..... 24 credits Master of Science in Acupuncture ................ 25 credits Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ...................................... 25 credits Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ..................................................... 30 credits Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine ................. 30 credits Students who are seeking degrees in multiple programs must plan their registrations carefully so that they do not exceed the stated limits. Students enrolled in dual programs may use the credit limit of either program. In extraordinary cases, very capable students may be allowed to exceed the maximum for their programs upon approval by their department chairs. Department chairs indicate their approval by signing student registration or add/drop forms and noting the credit load being approved. Any approved in-crease may not exceed 10 percent of the above totals. AttendAnce policy Course and Lab Attendance PolicyBastyr University does not have a universal course and lab attendance policy. However, faculty mem-bers may establish attendance requirements for their course(s) or lab(s). Some state licensing boards and the Veteran's Administration require 90 percent attendance. Students receiving financial assistance from the Veteran's Administration or students who need to meet state licensing board requirements are responsible for notifying the faculty of their need to document attendance. When a student has an excused absence, the fac- ulty member may require that the student complete an assignment to make up for the time missed. An absence is considered excused if the student has a legitimate personal emergency, a serious illness or a documented birth (midwifery program students), as long as the student calls the faculty member(s) or leaves a message for the faculty member(s) with the faculty services department regarding the situation in advance (24-hour voicemail is available). Faculty may require documentation upon return from the excused absence. It is the student's responsibility to meet with the faculty member to discuss the absence and make up work upon return. Not meeting the stated attendance requirements for the class may affect the student's final grade, and a student may be required to take the course again. In addition to possible consequences for absences, habitual tardi-ness may be taken into account by faculty as part of the course grade and/or may be reported to the dean of students for disciplinary action. Students cannot register for two courses or labs that are scheduled at overlapping times. Credit can only be applied to a single course at any one given time. Students cannot attend a course without be-ing registered for it and must attend the section of a course or lab for which they are registered. Failure to follow this policy may result in loss of course credit or a course grade of no show (NS). Clinic Attendance PolicyAll student clinicians are required to attend at least 80 percent of each assigned quarter shift in order to receive a grade of Achieved Competency (AC). Holidays and emergency closures of the clinic do not figure into the total quarter attendance. A student who does not attend at least 80 percent of the shift (two excused absences) will receive a failure grade for that shift and lose all accumulated patient contacts and hours for that shift. The entire shift would need to be taken again. Exceptional circumstances resulting in a third absence may be approved at the discretion of the supervisor. Four or more absences will result in an automatic failure for that shift. Please note that 100 percent of the required clinical hours must be completed before recommendation for graduation. Please refer to the Student Clinician Handbook - Global Module for further details. General InformatIon ~ a cademIc PolIcIeS and ProcedureS16 Religious or Spiritual Holidays The University's policy is to attempt to accommo- date the observance of religious practices. Religious absences will not count against any attendance requirement, but students are responsible for the information and material covered. Students ob-serving such holidays are required to notify faculty during the first week of classes as well as find sub-stitutes for clinic shifts affected. Students should follow reschedule exam procedures in the event an exam falls on a religious holiday. Bastyr University schedules clinical training and occasional required courses or intensives on weekends. Students with religious restrictions against attending classes on weekends need to contact their program chairs, in advance, when such conflicts occur. Efforts will be made to resolve such conflicts, but a resolution cannot be guaranteed. Convention, Conference, Seminar and Work- shop Attendance Policy Occasionally, there may be professional conven- tions or conferences offered during the academic year that programs encourage their students to at-tend. Students who wish to attend such events must receive advance permission from their instructor(s) if there is an attendance requirement for the class or an exam or project due during that time. Students are responsible for the information and material missed. Students who receive permission must ar-range with faculty to take missed quizzes and exams immediately upon return, as outlined in the policy on rescheduled examinations in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual. Students must also comply with clinic absence policies. Please refer to the Student Clinician Handbook - Global Module for further details. univerSity cloSure In the event of unplanned school closures for weather or community emergencies, students are required to make up missed course requirements or clinic contact hours. Should the duration of the closure be too long or too late to make up missed requirements/hours in the time allotted, the Uni - versity reserves the right to extend the quarter and/or academic year to allow for additional make-up time. Please see the inclement weather policy/pro-cedure on MyBU for more information regarding University closure.criMinAl BAckground checkS Bastyr University requires national background checks for all students enrolling in clinical training courses. Background checks must be completed prior to any student contact with patients at Bastyr Center for Natural Health, an affiliate clinic, or a practicum or preceptor site. Students will also be required to immediately notify the dean or department chair of their program and their clinical training program supervisors if charged with and/or convicted of a felony after the background check has been conducted. Students should also note that Bastyr University requires that all felonies be disclosed at time of application for admission. Failure to comply with these disclosure requirements may result in immediate dismissal from the University. See \"Background Checks\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information. policy on tB teSting And hepAtitiS B iMMuniz AtionS These policies were enacted to protect the health and safety of employees and students who may be exposed to certain biohazards in the campus and clinic working environments. Tuberculosis ScreeningAll faculty, staff and students who work or have shifts at Bastyr Center for Natural Health are re-quired to be screened annually for tuberculosis (TB), and are responsible to provide documentation of their results. Screening results can be submitted directly to the Facilities and Safety Office on cam-pus, room 38, or to the TB Results box, outside the Medical Records service window at the clinic. Bastyr provides two TB testing clinics each year, and all are encouraged to have their screening per-formed in sync with these week-long clinics, called TB Weeks. T wo screening options are available: T uberculosis Skin Test (TST) or QuantiFERON blood test (QFG). Students pay $10 toward the cost of their TST during the TB Week clinic, or $20 if you make a spe-cial appointment at Bastyr Center. QFG is available at Bastyr Center for an approximate cost of $110. If a chest x-ray is necessary, Bastyr University agrees to pay $37.50 toward this cost. Other locations are available with low cost options. Questions regarding TB screening or requests for forms can be addressed to the campus facilities and safety office or to the safety manager at the clinic. General InformatIon ~ a cademIc PolIcIeS and ProcedureS17 Hepatitis B Immunizations All ND, AOM and clinical nutrition students, AOM and ND faculty and staff at Bastyr Center, and faculty or laboratory and operations assistants who are category I (those who have daily exposure to blood or body fluids) and category II (those who have occasional exposure to blood or body fluids) are required to either take the hepatitis B immunization series, provide documentation that they have had such immunizations in the past 10 years, or sign a waiver refusing the immunizations along with a release of liability form. Bastyr University agrees to pay 50 percent of the cost of the hepatitis B immunization series for students. Note: All students are required to pay in full the cost of testing antibody levels for any of the agents listed above, if they choose to check for individual immunity, prior to waiving or taking any immu-nizations. Commencement of the immunization series (or submission of a waiver) and TB screening shall oc-cur before the first day of work for all faculty and staff, and before ND, AOM and clinical nutrition students begin their clinic shifts. Hepatitis immuni-zation forms/waivers are distributed to students in one of their required clinical courses. Hepatitis im-munization questions can be directed to the Blood Borne Pathogen Safety Officer. Anyone who has elected to waive the immuniza- tion series has the option to change that election, at any time, and take the immunization series. degree And certificA te requireMent S To earn a degree at Bastyr University, a degree candidate must have completed the prescribed curriculum (refer to the specific academic program section), earned passing grades in all required courses and clinic shifts, satisfied the requirement for total degree or certificate credits, and been recommended for graduation by the faculty. To be eligible to graduate with a master's degree or graduate-level certificate, the candidate must have a minimum GPA of 3.0; a bachelor's degree candidate must have a minimum GPA of 2.0. Students in the articulated bachelor's/master's AOM degree program must fol-low the degree requirements of that school. A student is held to degree requirements in ef- fect at the time of initial matriculation unless legal or accreditation standards mandate a change to an existing degree or certificate program. Those degree and certificate requirements are published in the edition of the Bastyr University Catalog that is in effect at the time of first matriculation. In rare circumstances, a course may be deleted from the required curriculum and/or curriculum substitu-tions may be made at the discretion of the school or the University. A student who is readmitted after an absence of more than one calendar year may be held to the requirements in effect at the time of his/her return or may elect to graduate under degree or certifi-cate requirements specified in a subsequent Bastyr University Catalog with written permission of the program dean/chair. Under no circumstances are the requirements from an earlier catalog applied. Students in the ND and MSAOM programs must complete their degrees within six years. (In extraordinary circumstances, a one-year extension may be approved for ND students.) Students in the DAOM, MSA, MS Midwifery and MS nutrition programs must complete their degrees within five years. There is no time limit on the completion of undergraduate programs. Students in all degree and certificate programs must have discharged satisfactorily all financial obli-gations to the University (tuition, fees, library fines, and all other charges), including the graduation fee, for each program in which a degree or certificate is to be awarded. For students who have not met their financial obligations at the time of graduation, the earned degrees and certificates are posted to their records, but diplomas and official transcripts are held until the financial obligations are cleared. deAdlineS for the AwArding of degreeS The awarding and posting of degrees at Bastyr University are governed by specific deadlines. These deadlines affect the actual awarding of degrees. Stu-dent participation in commencement ceremonies is governed by a separate policy. The dates for final examinations each quarter and for commencement ceremonies are published in the Bastyr University Catalog and the registrar's quarterly calendar. For all bachelor's, master's and professional doc- toral degrees awarded by Bastyr University: All coursework must be completed by the last day of the quarter for graduating students. Any IP, I or PC grades in coursework or clinic shifts must be replaced with passing grades no later than the last day of the quarter. If a student has any outstanding course or grade requirements on the last day of the quarter, his/her degree will be posted at the close of the subsequent quarter. General InformatIon ~ a cademIc PolIcIeS and ProcedureS18 grAding policy Grades are assigned based on the grading system of the department/program offering the course, rather than by the academic program in which the enrolled student is matriculated. Core courses required for an academic program will be graded according to the normal grading policy for that program. Naturopathic Medicine/Dietetic InternshipBastyr University provides a competency-based learning format in the classroom for students in the naturopathic medicine program, clinic courses and the dietetic internship program. A competency-based evaluation of student work and performance is structured on the premise of demonstrating competence of a well-defined set of information and/or skills. With a competency system of grading, a student is aware of the learning objectives and core com - petencies for each course and clinic shift, knows how knowledge and understanding of these objec-tives and competencies are measured, and has the opportunity to demonstrate mastery by means of quizzes, exams, papers and/or practical application. The competencies established for each course reflect the goals and objectives of the appropriate program of study. Program and department chairs in the professional programs, in consultation with the faculty, determine the requirements and standards that students must meet in order to earn a grade of Achieved Competency, Partial Competency or Failure. Naturopathic Medicine Degree Program, Dietetic Internship and Clinical Shifts AC - Achieved Competency PC - Partial Competency F - Failure I - Incomplete - Personal emergency or seri-ous illness W - Withdrawn -Withdrawal form must be completed, signed and filed in the reg - istrar's office at least three weeks before the end of a given quarter. The W grade is transcripted for all course withdrawals after the first week of the quarter (with the exception of courses that have not yet met). AW - Administrative Withdrawal IP - In Progress - for clinic shifts, preceptor-ships, clinic entry, theses, didactic courses and internshipsN - No Grade CE - Challenge Examination NS - No Show AU - Audit WV - Waived ACHIEVED COMPETENCY (AC): A grade of AC indicates the student has gained the defined knowledge, information, skills and core competen-cies and has met the learning objectives as defined in the syllabi. Students must attain a level of achieved competency (AC) in all courses, clinic shifts and in-ternships. AC grades are not factored into the GPA. PARTIAL COMPETENCY (PC): A grade of PC indicates that an aspect of the learning objectives or core competencies has not been achieved and there is need for further study to earn the required AC. Faculty determine the date by which a PC grade must be converted; however, PC grades must be converted no later than the end of the break of the subsequent quarter in which the grade was received. Students may be required to complete a PC contract with the faculty member. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's office. Grades of PC that have not been converted to AC grades by the deadline revert to F grades. The course, lab, clinic shift or internship must then be repeated. PC grades do not translate into partial credit on transcripts and are not factored into the GPA. FAILURE (F): A grade of F indicates failure to meet the minimum level of competency for learn-ing objectives or core competencies. A student who receives a failure in a required course, lab, clinic shift or internship must repeat that course, lab, clinic shift or internship. INCOMPLETE (I): A student who is doing satisfactory work in a course but cannot complete the work because of a serious illness or personal emergency may receive an Incomplete grade by filing a request for incomplete grade form with the registrar. Faculty determine the date by which an I grade must be converted; however, I grades must be converted no later than the end of the break subsequent to the quarter in which the grade was received. Students may be required to complete an I grade contract with the faculty member. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's office. ADMINISTRATIVE WITHDRAWAL (AW): A student who is suffering from a serious illness or experiencing a personal emergency and is unable to withdraw from term-based classes within the General InformatIon ~ a cademIc PolIcIeS and ProcedureS19 appropriate time frame may be awarded an AW grade by the registrar. The AW grade is awarded for all incomplete courses in a given quarter. (See \"Administrative Withdrawal\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information.) IN PROGRESS (IP): IP grades are indicated for didactic courses, clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, clinic preparation, theses, internships, and clinic entry courses in which work may extend beyond the end of a quarter. If not converted to a passing grade, IP grades may be converted to an F grade. NO GRADE (N): N grades are assigned to indicate that a student is awarded no credit for a course but did not fail that course. N grades are administrative grades and are assigned only by the registrar. N grades are not refundable. CHALLENGE EXAMINATION (CE): Please see \"Challenge Examinations\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information. NO SHOW (NS): NS grades are assigned to in- dicate that a student did not attend class. NS grades are not refundable, and no credit is given. AUDIT (AU): Students generally audit a course for their personal enrichment. No credit is given, and no academic grade granted. Courses taken for audit cannot serve as a prerequisite for a subsequent course. WAIVED (WV): Courses are generally waived if a student has demonstrated competency in a particular subject matter but does not have the appropriate level of coursework from an accredited institution to allow a transfer of credit. There is no credit attached to a waived course, and a student is required to make up the corresponding credits waived with additional elective credits. Undergraduate Degree ProgramsFor the undergraduate degree programs, a student must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA in order to remain in good standing. Undergraduate students in the School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine must maintain a 2.5 GPA in their first year and a 3.0 GPA in their second year. Any required course in which a student receives a grade of F must be repeated.

Graduate Degree Programs: (DAOM, The grading system used for graduate degree programs is identical to the undergraduate system, as shown above, except for the following: There is no grade of D+, D or D- for a graduate student, and the IP grade applies also to ongoing work on a thesis. For an explanation of grading terms, see the listing under the professional degree programs. General InformatIon ~ a cademIc PolIcIeS and ProcedureS20 For the graduate degree programs, a student must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better. Any required course in which a student receives a grade of F must be repeated. Grade Change PolicyThe grades of PC, IP and I are considered tem- porary grades and designed to be changed. The grades of AC, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- and F are considered permanent grades and can be changed only if a faculty error was made at the time of issuance. The faculty member must submit documentation demonstrating the error to the reg-istrar. Students are not allowed to submit additional work after the quarter has ended with the intent to raise an A- through F grade. The option of \"extra credit\" work must be written into the syllabus and collected prior to quarter's end. F or PC in Sequential Courses If a student has an F grade, or a PC that converts to an F grade, in a sequence course, the student will not be allowed to continue study in the next sequential course. If a PC grade is not remediated by 5 p.m. on the Friday at the end of the first week of the quarter, the student will be withdrawn from the course. independent Study policy Independent study allows individual students to study areas of interest not included in the regular curriculum with the aid of an instructor or a selected resource person. Registration forms for independent study are available from the Office of the Registrar. The deadlines for registration, payment and grading of independent study courses are the same as those for regularly scheduled courses. Required courses may not be taken by independent study. Students may take an independent study course only if they are in good academic standing. ND students may request to do an independent study after they have completed at least 50 credits of their degree program. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine and nutrition students must have com-pleted at least 30 credits of their degree program. Integrated human biology students must have com-pleted at least 60 credits of their degree program. Psychology students must have completed at least 45 credits of their degree program. Students may apply a maximum of five (5) credits of independent study toward the completion of their degree program. Students pursuing two majors as an undergradu-ate may apply a maximum of ten (10) credits by independent study, five (5) toward each program. trAnSfer , wAiver And SuBStitution policy Requests for transfer or waiver of credit must be submitted and reviewed within 12 months of a student's matriculation date or before the quarter in which the student is required to complete the course, whichever comes first. Courses taken prior to entry at Bastyr can only be transferred to Bastyr during a student's first year of attendance. After the first year, previous courses taken can only be considered for waiver of required Bastyr courses, and elective credits must be taken to make up the waived credit. If this timeline is not followed and a course is waived/transferred after the start of the quarter in which a student is registered for that course, the standard course refund policy will apply. The courses under consideration for waiver or trans-fer should generally be no older than seven years. Waivers and transfer credit will not be awarded for courses submitted for transfer after the quarter in which the student is expected to take the course at Bastyr University. If an enrolled student wishes to complete a program requirement at another institution with the intent to transfer or waive the course at Bastyr, the student must request approval in advance by submitting a petition to waive, substitute or transfer credits along with the course description from the other institution. Courses submitted for transfer that have not received prior approval are not guaranteed transferability. coMpetency exAM Competency examinations are available when there is evidence on a student's official transcript of coursework completed in an area of study but the competencies, level of material or accreditation of the institution granting the original credit is in question. Competency examinations are also avail-able when the age of the coursework exceeds the guidelines in the transfer credit policy. Competency examinations are not available when the coursework in question was completed at Bastyr University. If a student satisfactorily completes the exam, the student will be awarded transfer or waiver credit in accordance with the transfer credit policy. Please see \"Competency Examinations\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information. General InformatIon ~ a cademIc PolIcIeS and ProcedureS21 trAnSfer T ransfer credit recognizes coursework from another accredited institution as satisfying a Bastyr required course. T ransfer credit grants credit for the Bastyr course and eliminates the need for the student to take that course. A petition to transfer may be requested by students who, at another accredited institution of higher education, have satisfactorily completed coursework that is the same in terms of content, level and credit as a specific Bastyr course, and meets or exceeds the academic objectives and competencies of a required course in Bastyr's pro-grams. T ransfer credit will generally not be granted for classes that are part of another earned degree or for classes that are taught at a different academic level. For courses taken prior to matriculation into Bastyr, transfer credit can only be granted within the first year of attendance. T ransfer credit may be granted from institutions that are accredited by regional accrediting agencies recognized by the American Council on Educa-tion Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation and from institutions that are profes-sionally accredited by the CNME, ACAOM and MEAC. Students who apply to Bastyr University with credit from institutions outside the U.S. are required to have international transcripts evaluated by an in-dependent evaluation service. The evaluation report must be issued by an NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services) accredited evalua-tion service. Credits from schools outside the U.S. are evaluated according to nationally established norms. wAiver A waiver does not grant credit; it only eliminates the necessity for taking the required course. Students are required to complete the equivalent number of credits approved via the waiver with elective credits. A petition to waive may be requested when formal train-ing, coursework or experience has been earned at an accredited or unaccredited institution. A student must provide documentation showing that the competen-cies of the Bastyr University course have been met. In some cases a competency or challenge exam may be required before the waiver will be granted. Students are advised to refer to policies governing competency or challenge examinations in the Aca - demic Policy and Procedure Manual. The waiver decision rests with the chair of the department responsible for teaching the curriculum. Appeals may be made to the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled, whose decision is final. SuBStitution In some cases, students may request to substitute one Bastyr University course for another Bastyr course if the courses are the same in terms of content, level and credit and meet or exceed the academic objectives and competencies of the required course. Substitution both grants credits and eliminates the necessity for taking the required course. For additional information regarding transfer, waiver or substitution of credit, please contact the advising/evaluations unit in the registrar's office.

The total of these funds must cover the cost of the first year of school, books, insurance and living expenses. Official bank statements as proof of liquid assets are required to document suf-ficient funds. A signed affidavit of support (available from the admissions office) is required if the bank state-ment/account proving the availability of required funds is not in the student's name. The amount required to cover expenses for the first year is dependent upon the program of study. If you have dependents who will apply for F-2 Visas, the cost of living expenses for the spouse and/or children must be provided. The current cost of total expenses for each student and the cost of living per each dependent is listed on the 1-20 docu-mentation worksheet, which is part of the application packet for international students. finAnciAl ASSiSt Ance And eMployMent International students are not eligible for U.S. federal or state-funded student aid programs but may obtain private loans with a U.S. citizen or resident as a co-signer. Canadian students also have access to the Canadian federal student loan program and most provincial loans. Documentation of sufficient fund-ing is required for F-1 students because off-campus employment is prohibited by the USCIS during the first year of study. International students are limited to no more than 20 hours a week of on-campus employment while school is in session and may work full-time during vacation periods, as long as they have maintained status and intend to register for the follow - ing term. Bastyr University has a very limited amount of international employment money available. General admISSIonS29 finAnciAl Aid The role of the financial aid office at Bastyr Univer- sity is to assist students in obtaining the funding they need to reach their educational goals. Bastyr University participates in the full range of state and federal student financial aid programs. Student eligibility is determined following the state and federal regulations that apply to each particular aid program. Graduate students primarily rely on federal edu- cational loan programs, including Federal Direct unsubsidized and Graduate PLUS loans, and the Perkins loan program. Employment opportunities are provided by the federal and state work-study programs. Additional support is provided by scholarship pro- grams administered by Bastyr University from both endowed programs and University resources. Undergraduate students are also eligible for all of the programs mentioned above except Graduate PLUS loans, but parents of dependent undergraduate students may apply for a Federal Direct Parent PLUS loan. Undergraduate students may also be eligible for subsidized Federal Direct Stafford loans and federal grants (Pell grants and Federal Supplemental Educa-tional Opportunity grants). Washington state residents may be eligible for a Washington State Need Grant. Private loan programs also provide a supplemental source of funding to students. These loans require a positive credit history and/or a co-signer with good credit. All international students are eligible for Uni - versity-funded scholarships and grants as well as on-campus employment from University funds. Financial Aid Deadlines: There are no formal University deadlines. However, undergraduate students are encouraged to apply by April 1 in order to receive consideration for several external grant programs with early deadlines. All students are encouraged to apply for financial aid at least 90 days before the first quarter of attendance. Detailed information on application procedures, program costs, and financial aid funding are pub-lished annually in the Bastyr University Financial Aid Handbook. The Bastyr University Financial Aid Handbook and financial aid application are located on the Bastyr website and the MyBU student portal. Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Federal student aid regulations mandate that students who wish to be considered for financial aid must be making satisfactory progress in a degree or certificate program. This requirement applies to the entire period of enrollment at Bastyr University, even though students may not have received finan-cial aid for some periods of enrollment. Satisfactory academic progress is currently reviewed at the end of each spring quarter. It is also students' responsibility to monitor their own progress. All students must meet the published academic standards for their individual programs. Students placed on suspension or limited suspension are not eligible for financial aid. Undergraduate students awarded a State Need Grant must complete at least 50 percent of the credits for which they received funding for that quarter. Failure to complete the required number of credits each quarter will result in cancellation of subsequent disbursements. Satisfactory academic progress is monitored at the end of each quarter for this program. See the student portal (MyBU) under Financial Aid menu option for the complete satisfactory aca-demic progress policy for financial aid eligibility. Required Return of Federal Financial Aid The University is required to return federal Title VI funds when a student fully withdraws during the first 60 percent of any quarter. Please see the student portal (MyBU) under financial aid for the complete policy. Required Return of State Financial AidThe University is required to return state finan- cial aid when a student fully withdraws during the first half of any quarter. Please see the student portal (MyBU) under financial aid for the complete policy. Gainful Employment ComplianceAs of July 1, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education will require institutions who participate in the student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, to report certain information about students enrolled in their Title IV eligible programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized oc-cupation. At this time, the regulations only apply to the certificate programs in Chinese Herbal Medicine and Holistic Landscape Design. The following links to our website will provide that information: Certificate in Chinese Herbal Medicine www.herbal1.bastyr.eduCertificate in Holistic Landscape Design www.landscape.bastyr.eduGeneral admISSIonS30 baStyr under Graduate ProGramS bastyr undergraduate programs MiSSion StAteMent for undergrAdu Ate progrAMS The mission of the Bastyr University bachelor's de- gree completion programs is to help each student build a strong foundation of basic knowledge and skills, as well as foster a greater understanding of health of body, mind and spirit. viSion StAteMent for undergrAdu Ate progrAMS Bastyr University bachelor's degree completion pro- grams provide students with opportunities to develop competency in basic skills such as written and verbal communication, critical thinking and the ability to work cooperatively with others. The degree completion programs also provide students with opportunities to develop competency in the fundamental theories, models, core knowledge and skills of their major field of study. The degree completion programs uniquely empha- size the importance of holism and the natural health arts and sciences. The programs provide students with opportunities to develop a deeper understanding of the interconnections between body, mind and spirit and learn to foster wellness in themselves and others through approaches found in the natural health arts and sciences. undergrAdu Ate educA tion At BAStyr univerSity As Bastyr University continues to develop un- dergraduate degree offerings, we strive to maintain consistency across all programs in terms of admis-sions requirements, shared courses, double majors and undergraduate student support. The under-graduate experience at Bastyr encompasses a range of academic programs, which are coordinated by the Undergraduate Committee. Admissions require - ments, the structure of interdisciplinary courses, double majors and general policy issues affecting undergraduates are all considered by this committee. The Undergraduate Committee works closely with the admissions office to ensure that applicants who meet all basic criteria are admitted to the University and to the undergraduate program of their choice.the undergrAdu Ate MAjorS Exercise Science and Wellness (For curriculum see page 59.)

Students may complete a program on a part-time basis but should recognize that there may be scheduling conflicts between required cours-es. It is the responsibility of a student who wishes to complete a program on a part-time basis to work with an advisor to arrange an appropriate schedule. Special sections will not be offered to accommodate the needs of part-time students. douBle MAjorS for undergrAdu Ate Student S Bastyr University will allow students to complete two majors, provided students are in good standing at the time they wish to declare their second major. The second major cannot be declared until the second quarter of attendance. However, students may start attending courses required for the second major in their first quarter of attendance. Students must submit a declaration of double major form to the registrar's office at the time the major is declared. Students are required to have their program of study approved by the appropriate chair(s) and/or dean(s) at the time the double major is declared. There are no predetermined schedules for the double majors. It is the student's responsibility to create appropriate schedules for double major com-binations. Students must meet quarterly with the undergraduate advisor in the registrar's office for as-sistance in tracking the progress of the two majors. Students are advised that declaring a double major will increase the amount of time it takes to graduate. 31 The minimum amount of time to complete any double major is three years. If the required courses for any quarter exceed the limit on student credit loads as outlined on page 15 of the Bastyr University Catalog, the student must obtain permission from the academic chairs of both majors. Students earning a double major must usually complete no fewer than 220 credits. The credit re-quirement total for double majors is determined by the total of the prerequisite basic proficiency, science and general education credits, the major core credits in both programs and any elective credit requirement with defined parameters for one or both majors (for example, two activity credits required for exercise science and wellness majors). Where duplication exists between the two majors, the student is not required to make up the credits represented by the duplication. undergrAdu Ate AcAdeMic proBA tion, SuSpenSion And diSMiSSAl Summary information on academic probation, suspension and dismissal as well as the appeals pro-cess, applicable to all students, is provided on page 14 of this catalog. In addition to the information provided below, more specific standards, guidelines and practices may be developed and published by individual schools and/or programs of the Univer-sity. Undergraduate students should refer to the complete policies governing probation, suspension, dismissal and appeals published in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual. Reasons for Academic Probation An undergraduate student may be placed on aca- demic probation under the following circumstances: The student's cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0 The student's GPA for the quarter is below that required for graduation, even if the student's cumu-lative GPA is above that required for graduation The student earned a grade lower than the mini- mum required by the school or program in a required course, internship or clinical rotation The student's record shows that s/he has failed a course more than once, or that the student has a number of incompletes and/or withdrawals that the dean or dean's designee considers to be of concern A student placed on academic probation will be required to meet with a faculty advisor to develop an academic improvement plan that the student must complete in order to be removed from academic probation. A student is generally placed on academic proba- tion for one quarter. If the dean or dean's designee determines that the student has not satisfied the conditions of the probation, the dean or dean's designee will determine whether the student will be: Continued on probation and the circum- stances for continued probation Placed on suspension (see below) Recommended for dismissal (see below) The dean or dean's designee will notify the student each quarter that s/he remains on probation and whenever the student's academic status has changed. Dismissal for Academic Deficiencies Each school at Bastyr University has a Student Prog-ress Committee that follows an individual dismissal policy. Recommendations for dismissal are submitted to the provost for consideration. The provost will make the final decision on student dismissals.A student may be dismissed from Bastyr University: If the student fails to fulfill the conditions of academic probation After the second consecutive quarter on pro- bation (including summer, if enrolled) After the third quarter on probation (includ- ing summer, if enrolled); the quarters need not be consecutive Students who are dismissed will be dropped from all classes for which they are registered at the time of dismissal. SuMMer MASSA ge inten Sive Bastyr University and the Bellevue Massage School Center for Healing Arts offer a summer massage train-ing program that allows students to apply coursework taken at Bastyr University toward the Washington state requirements for licensure. This course cannot be audited.

If a transfer student is found to be deficient in some area(s) of study, s/he may be required to complete additional 35 students in all of the University's programs. Within the acupuncture and Oriental medicine clinic, students receive clinical training in acupuncture and Chinese herbs. In addition to training at the University clinic, students have the opportunity to train at several com-munity medical sites that provide clinical experience in working with diverse populations. The clinical training program begins in the first year and is comprised of three observation shifts, one preceptorship and either 14 (MSA) or 16 (MSAOM) student clinician shifts. The three ob-servation shifts can be completed in any of the five quarters preceding clinician status. All observation hours, shifts and interim observation hours must be completed prior to starting as a student clinician, in spring of the second year. The preceptorship shift may be performed in either the observation or clinician phase of training. A minimum of one observation shift must be completed in order to do a preceptorship. Students in the MSAOM program or the CCHM program also take eight Chinese herbal shifts and two Chinese herbal dispensary shifts in the latter portion of their program. On a space available basis, students are welcome to take additional clinic shifts for elective credit. However, elective shifts cannot be used to make up missing hours in core shifts due to prior or future absences. Admission as a clinician to the AOM student training clinic at Bastyr Center for Natural Health is based on: 1) good academic standing, 2) comple-tion of a bachelor's degree or being enrolled in or graduated from an acupuncture master's program, 3) completion of the required prerequisite curricu-lum, 4) successful passage of the clinic entry written and practical exam, 5) current CPR for health care provider certification, and 6) certification in Clean Needle Technique (CNT). Please be aware that the opportunity to be placed at one of the external clinics offered through Bastyr University is contingent on the student's ability to provide documentation of a vaccination his- tory. If this documentation is unavailable or out of date, students will need to update their vaccines at either local health centers or through their per-sonal physicians. The community clinic rotations are outstanding clinical experiences in working with underserved and special patient populations, including developing skills working with medical translators. Students who are unable to provide vaccine documentation will not be eligible for this rotation and clinical training may be restricted to the Bastyr student clinic. Students are also required to submit to a national criminal background check. generAl educA tion requireMent S Natural sciences and mathematics ................ 12 quarter credits Arts and humanities ...................................... 15 quarter credits Social sciences ............................................... 15 quarter credits Speech communication or public speaking ... 3 quarter credits Electives ........................................................ 25 quarter credits1 1The number of elective credits may vary depending upon the exact number of quarter credits earned in the other prerequisite catego- ries.

This course cannot be audited. This program of study is an excellent future practice builder. The schedule for this training works particularly well for MSA students. Students interested in further information may meet with their academic advisor in the registrar's office to discuss the program avail-ability and the course prerequisites. BASic ScienceS curriculuM within Acupuncture And orient Al Medicine Basic science courses within acupuncture and Oriental medicine include Anatomy and Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology. These courses serve as a foundation for an understanding of the hu-man body and provide students with the necessary skills and competency to pursue coursework in the AOM program. In addition, a portion of the AOM Anatomy and Physiology course is taught in Bastyr's cadaver anatomy lab, thus giving students the unique opportunity to study anatomy in greater depth. Basic science courses in the doctoral program include Pathology of Cancer, Pharmacology and Advanced Living Anatomy. The basic sciences faculty encourages and expects students to advance beyond the simple learning of scientific facts and to integrate systematically the information from basic science disciplines into a unified model of human organization and function. This educational scheme requires students to assume an active role in the learning process and encourages them to adopt this inquisitive behavior for a lifetime. Problem solving, clinical cases and examples are an integral part of the basic science curriculum. This educational process is an expression of Bastyr University's basic philosophy of a holistic approach to human behavior, health and therapeutics. The basic sciences faculty encourages students to pursue an integrated approach to learning and understand-ing. Instructors are readily available to facilitate this process on an individual basis. The department also offers General Chemistry in a summer intensive format, which is a prerequisite requirement for the AOM program. counSeling And heAlth pSychology curriculuM within Acupuncture And orient Al Medicine The counseling and health psychology curricu- lum trains students in understanding and effecting change in the emotional, mental and spiritual dimensions of human functioning.

The CCHM is a graduate course of study and, as such, follows the grading policies of the school of AOM degree programs. Students accepted into the combined Bachelor/ Master of Science degree program receive their bachelor's degree upon graduation from the master's program. If a student voluntarily or involuntarily leaves the program prior to completion of the mas-ter's, she/he may be eligible for a bachelor's degree if the student has a combined upper and lower division quarter credit total of 180 credits (specific course requirements also apply. See the dean for further information.) Furthermore, a student must have a minimum of 45 quarter credits in residence at Bastyr University.In order to receive a license to practice acupunc- ture in the majority of states a student must earn either an MSA or MSAOM degree, pass the NC-CAOM licensing exam and meet any additional state requirements. Several states require Chinese herbal medicine training for licensure (e.g., CA, FL, NM, TX). Students graduating with an MSA degree may need to consider taking the CCHM program as a postgraduate option to meet this requirement. 1Credits do not include prerequisites/corequisites. Students may enter their course of study either into the combined BS/MS programs or directly into the MS programs.

Acupuncture And orient Al Medicine doctorAl progrAM MiSSion StAteMent The mission of Bastyr University's Doctor of Acu- puncture and Oriental Medicine program is to develop the knowledge and skills of qualified practitioners in the specialties of integrated oncology and advanced pain management. The program accomplishes this through rigorous training in traditional Chinese medicine and biomedical concepts, and by emphasizing an integrative model of care delivery. The program graduates leaders in the field of acupuncture and Oriental medicine pre-pared for lifelong learning and achievement in clinical practice, education and scholarship. expected leArning outcoMeS Graduates of the School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine's clinical doctoral program will have the skills to: develop an advanced TCM diagnosis and treat-ment plan including all applicable modalities within the scope of practice, commensurate with patients' health statuses. demonstrate an understanding of allopathic oncology and pain treatment protocols in order to inform TCM care. discuss treatment planning issues as part of an integrated medical team. demonstrate an ability to participate as part of a clinic supervisory team educating master's stu-dents in acupuncture and Oriental medicine. conduct research that demonstrates knowledge and skills in study design and comprehension. The AOM clinical doctorate is focused on train- ing students in cancer care and advanced pain management and treatment with an emphasis on training in integrated clinical settings. Students develop skills in clinical research and teaching with an in-depth focus on a medical specialty. Courses include advanced Chinese medical classics, advanced acupuncture techniques, Chinese herbs School of acuPuncture and orIental medIcIne42 and therapeutics classes. Basic science classes focus on oncology and pain conditions pertaining to pathology and pharmacology. The curriculum also includes nutrition and patient management courses. A capstone research project is required. The degree title is \"DAOM,\" Doctor of Acu- puncture and Oriental Medicine. At the present time, there is no change in scope of practice for DAOM graduates. Students would choose to pursue this training if they are 1) interested in a doctoral degree in traditional Chinese medicine, 2) interested in oncology and management of advanced pain con-ditions and /or 3) interested in learning to conduct clinical research. This is a clinical doctoral degree, not a PhD program. clinicAl coMponent The DAOM program emphasizes clinical train- ing in integrated care settings, with rotations at Bastyr Center for Natural Health, Seattle, Washing-ton; Providence Regional Medical Center, Everett, Washington; and Skagit Valley Hospital Regional Cancer Care Center, Mount Vernon, Washington. As part of the clinical training, DAOM students travel to China and complete additional studies at Sichuan Integrated Hospital of Eastern and Western Medicine in Chengdu and Shanghai University of T raditional Chinese Medicine. Students take a one-credit course, Clinic Entry for China, in preparation for China studies. There are additional expenses associated with the China studies other than tuition, including travel, lodging and living expenses, and laboratory fees assessed by institutions in China. With planning, these expenses can be covered by financial aid. Ba-styr University holds fundraising events to support China studies. DAOM students may choose to participate in these fundraising events to help defray travel expenses in China. See the DAOM program director for more information. cApStone theSiS project As part of the program of study, DAOM stu- dents must complete a capstone research project. Capstone projects may take a variety of formats, including clinical or basic research, surveys, trans-lation, systematic review or theoretical analysis. Students are expected to conduct and complete their capstone project, including final acceptance of their capstone paper, by the time all other program requirements are completed. If additional time is needed for completion and all other program requirements are finished, then students will be as-sessed an additional fee (equal to 1 credit of tuition) in the quarter in which their capstone is submitted. Please see OM8199 \"Capstone Continuation\" and/or the Capstone Project Handbook for further details. prerequiSiteS Minimum prerequisites for the DAOM are a master's degree in acupuncture or acupuncture and Oriental medicine or a certificate of acupuncture with 10 years of documented clinical experience. Prospective students with certificates of acupuncture should contact the admissions office for specialized assistance. Applicants with AOM master's degrees must have graduated from an ACAOM-candidate or -accred-ited program and have formal academic training in Chinese herbs. If applicants do not have a Chinese herb background, then they must complete the Certificate in Chinese Herbal Medicine as a pre-requisite. Students may begin their doctoral studies if the classroom portion of the certificate has been completed. The clinical portion of the CCHM may be done concurrently with the DAOM program. Applicants to the doctoral program need to either have completed or be in the process of completing the following coursework: Intermediate algebra ............................................... 1 course General psychology .................................... 3 quarter credits General chemistry (allied-health level with lab) .................. 4 quarter credits Doctoral applicants must have a background in the basic sciences that is comparable to Bastyr University's master's curriculum. Upon review of past coursework, applicants may be asked to take a higher level science course or complete a com-petency exam. The minimum GPA for any past college-level education is 2.75. The following curriculum table lists the ten- tative schedule of courses each quarter. Next to each course are the number of credits per course (Crdt.), the lecture hours each week (Lec.), the lab/clinic hours each week (L/C) and the total contact hours for the course over the entire quar-ter (Tot).

Promote birth as a normal process requiring a minimum of intervention. Function within the health care system, con- sulting and referring appropriately. Qualify for licensure or registration in a variety of jurisdictions, including certification by the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM). Promote midwifery through state, provincial and national professional organizations, the political process, research activities and policy development. Work in partnership with the women they serve in a way that promotes personal responsibil-ity, validates knowledge and experience, and encourages lifelong learning. Promote the Midwives Model of Care. progrAM overview Bastyr's direct-entry midwifery program trains students in all aspects of midwifery practice, prepar - ing them to offer safe, high- quality maternity care to women and their families. The rigorous, proven curriculum makes use of state-of-the art technologies and a well-qualified, approved network of clinical training sites, includ-ing the opportunity for foreign clinical experience. The curriculum meets all of the core competencies and skills as identified by the Midwives Alliance of North American (MANA) and the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM). Studies in related fields such as epidemiology, nutrition, pharmacology, genetics, embryology, counseling, and education and as well as anti-racism training build skills necessary for the practice of culturally versatile competent midwifery. The department welcomes students who have previous midwifery training or practicing mid - wives who have not attended a formal midwifery educational program and/or want to earn a degree. All students in the program must meet the transfer credit requirements and complete at least two-thirds of the program and all of the practicum while en-rolled at Bastyr. Graduates qualify for national certification as a Certified Professional Midwife (CPM) and, depend-ing on regional requirements, may sit for licensure or provincial registration. Midwifery MASter 'S, coMBined BAchelor 'S/MASter 'S progrAM The Master of Science in Midwifery is available to students who already hold a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited college/university and who complete the program prerequisites prior to entering the program. The combined Bachelor/Master of Sci-ence in Midwifery option is available to students who have completed at least two years at the undergraduate level (60 semester or 90 quarter credits), including the basic science and proficiency prerequisites and general education requirements. Both degrees are awarded simultaneously at the completion of the program. Blended curriculuM Model One of the most exciting aspects of the program is its blended curriculum. This hybrid delivery system allows students to remain in their communities and commute to the Bastyr campus three times each quarter. Each cohort of students is on campus at the same time, which allows the face-to-face learn-ing experience that is vital to midwifery training. When not physically on campus, students use the Internet classroom to correspond with classmates and instructors, post discussions, turn in homework and take tests. Each cohort of students (determined by year of entry) attend the same onsite weeks together, which allows for the face-to-face learning experience that is vital to midwifery training and allows students to build strong relationships with classmates and faculty. Midwifery curriculuM The midwifery program addresses both the art and science of midwifery by integrating theory with clinical experience. The Midwifery Care courses are the foundation of the program. All courses build skills necessary for the practice of midwifery through the use of case questions, skills-practice labs, 54 School of natural health artS and ScIenceS role-plays, discussion, student presentations and research projects. Clinical skills and judgment are honed during practicum with practicing midwives. The midwifery curriculum is enhanced by studies in related fields such as epidemiology, nutrition, pharmacology, genetics, embryology, counseling and education. clinicAl experience The Department of Midwifery places all students in qualified clinical training sites. The program replicates the age-old apprenticeship model in which students work side-by-side with experienced preceptors who are licensed midwives and other professionals. Students are placed with preceptors in the community to integrate the skills learned in the classroom. At least two years of clinical training is required at a minimum of two clinical sites in North America. Optimal training sites include homebirth settings, birth centers, clinics and hospitals. Department staff works closely with each stu- dent to arrange these clinical placements. Students must live within a one-hour commute of a quali-fied preceptor site and may be required to relocate temporarily if the community in which they reside does not have adequate clinical training opportuni-ties. Personal flexibility and the support of family members are essential to manage possible separation and economic challenges. The clinical practicum begins in the third quarter of the program. Students may begin Practicum slowly, primarily observing for the first few months. Student participation in their preceptorships mir-rors what they are learning in the classroom. Basic clinical skills, such as performing blood draws, IVs, physical/ vaginal exams, pap smears, neonatal resuscitation, etc., are all taught in the classroom first. Students will be required to obtain training in adult CPR, have a TB test, be rubella immune and pass a criminal background check. A fee will be charged in MW4800 for the background check. Students returning from a leave of absence will be required to have clinical skills assessed and many need remedial skills training before becoming eli-gible for a practicum assignment. Students may obtain their clinical experience in gynecology/family planning clinics, prenatal/postpartum clinics, homebirth settings, birth centers and hospitals in North America as well as overseas. (See Graduation Requirements below for specifics about clinical training requirements.) Students may work with licensed midwives, certified profes-sional midwives, certified nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners, foreign midwives, naturopathic doc-tors, physician assistants or physicians. Preceptors must be practicing legally and serve a large enough obstetrical/gynecological population to adequately instruct, supervise and evaluate students' clinical training. The Department of Midwifery screens and approves all potential clinical preceptors.

The department's vision is to be the leader in advancing a holistic view of nutrition and exercise through excellence in education, research and clinical practice. The Department of Nutrition and Exercise Sci- ence prepares graduates to critically evaluate scientific literature and to incorporate current research and ad-vances in nutrition and exercise science. The nutrition program within the Department of Nutrition and Ex-ercise Science is unique in its emphasis on whole foods and multicultural, political and ecological dimensions of food. These aspects of nutrition, blended with biochemistry and physiology, reflect the University's natural health sciences philosophy. The concept of food as medicine and the concept of diet as a critical component in healing are funda-mental to natural therapeutics, optimal health and whole-person healing. The exercise science and well-ness program approaches health and wellness from a holistic perspective unique to Bastyr University. This focus on overall wellness, combined with the science behind it, provides students with a broad education in health and wellness from a preventative viewpoint. The Department of Nutrition and Exercise Sci- ence offers bachelor of science degrees with majors in nutrition, exercise science and wellness, nutrition and culinary arts, and nutrition and exercise science. In conjunction with the BS in nutrition, the department offers a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) that meets the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (the Academy) academic requirements leading to eligibility to apply for a dietetic internship. There are three Master of Science offerings in the Department of Nutrition and Exercise Science: the MS in Nutrition (Research), the MS in Nutrition with Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) and the MS in Nutrition and Clinical Health Psychology (CHP). In addition, the Dietetic Internship based on the Academy's standards of education is offered to provide performance requirements for entry-level dietitians through supervised practice. For information about each of these programs, refer to the following pages: BS with a Major in Exercise Science and Wellness page 59 BS with a Major in Nutrition page 58 BS with a Major in Nutrition and Culinary Arts page 63 BS with a Major in Nutrition and Exercise Sci- ence page 62 BS with a Major in Nutrition with DPD page 60 MS in Nutrition (Research) page 64 MS in Nutrition and Clinical Health Psychology page 65 MS in Nutrition with DPD page 67 Dietetic Internship page 69 required ABilitieS /SkillS for nutrition / exerciSe Science progrAM Student S A nutrition and/or exercise science student must be able to demonstrate appropriate communication skills; intellectual-conceptual, integrative and quan-titative abilities; and behavioral and social maturity.

BAchelor of Science with A MAjor in exerciSe Science And wellneSS The exercise science and wellness program provides a strong foundation in traditional exercise physiology, supplemented by study in nutritional, mental and emotional aspects of wellness. One of the primary goals of the program is to prepare graduates to sit for the certi-fication examinations of the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Strength and Conditioning Association. This preparation is accomplished through the rigorous scientific study and subsequent application of physiological changes and adaptations that occur during various modes of physical activity in clinical, preventative and performance settings. A graduate of the exercise science and wellness major may develop a career as cardiac/pulmonary rehabilitation physiologist, exercise physiologist, group exercise coor-dinator, exercise specialist, corporate wellness manager, strength and conditioning coach or personal trainer. AdMiSSionS The admissions standards and prerequisites are the same as those outlined on page 58 for the un-dergraduate nutrition program with the exception that Microbiology is not required for Nutrition and Exercise Science applicants. Consequently, eight natural science credits are required (rather than five). grAdu Ation requireMent S Please see the graduation requirements for the undergraduate nutrition program on page 58.

BAchelor of Science with A MAjor in nutrition with didActic progrAM in dieteticS (BSn/dpd) The Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) is a term used by the Academy of Nutrition and Di- etetics (the Academy) to describe a program that is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Educa-tion in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND), which meets academic competencies. Currently, in the United States, the registered dietitian (RD) is the only professional credential in nutrition recognized by all 50 states and with reciprocity in five countries. Verified completion of the DPD and a minimum of a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution enable a student to apply for a dietetic internship, to write the registration examination to become an RD after completing the Dietetic Intern-ship and to become an RD after successfully passing the registration examination. The mission of the program is to graduate stu- dents who will promote nutrition and well-being through food that sustains the individual, the com-munity and the earth. AdMiSSion requireMent S And prerequiSiteS Application for admission to the BSN/DPD at Bastyr University is separate from application to the degree programs. BSN/DPD application packets can be requested from the Bastyr University Office of Admissions at the beginning of spring quarter be-tween the junior and senior year. Acceptance requires the following prerequisites in addition to those for the Bachelor of Science with a Major in Nutrition: public speaking (if general or speech communica-tion, then must provide evidence of public speaking practice; this requirement is independent of any cur-riculum standards of the student's prior institution) and current enrollment at Bastyr University. To be eligible for acceptance into the BSN/DPD, students must have completed their junior year and must meet all prerequisites for the BSN completion de-gree. To be competitive for admission into the BSN/DPD, the following GPAs are required (cumulative from all colleges and universities attended): Cumulative overall GPA - total of all courses 3.25 Cumulative science GPA - biology, organic chem- istry, anatomy and physiology, microbiology and biochemistry courses only 3.25 Cumulative nutrition GPA - all nutrition courses 3.25 A minimum of 150 hours of volunteer and/or paid work experience is required prior to being admitted to the BSN/DPD. Documentation of hours with signature of sponsor is required. Specific information and forms for documenting these expe-riences is available from the admissions department. The following is a breakdown of the volunteer and/or paid work hours required for admission: Minimum of 50 hours clinical nutrition (in- patient hospital and/or long-term care) Minimum of 50 hours food service management Minimum of 50 hours community nutrition AdMiSSion to clinicAl trAining In order to enroll in clinical dietetic practicum, students must have successfully completed TR4207, RD4302, must be enrolled in TR4303 as a coreq-School of natural health artS and ScIenceS61 uisite, and must have met the criteria for behavior and attitude as outlined in the Nutrition Student Clinician Handbook. Students are also required to pass a national criminal background check (see \"Background Checks\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information) and must show proof of completion of the clinic entry check-list prior to the first scheduled clinic shift. grAdu Ation requireMent S In their final year, it is recommended that BSN/ DPD students meet with the DPD director for aca-demic advising each quarter prior to registration to discuss academic progress and as part of the Dietetic Internship application process. A total of 300 hours of volunteer and/or paid work experience is required to graduate from the BSN/DPD (inclusive of the 150 hours obtained prior to admission to the pro-gram). The following is a breakdown of those hours: Total of 100 hours clinical nutrition (in-patient and/or long-term care direct patient contact) Total of 100 hours food service managementTotal of 100 hours community nutrition Leadership by participation in the Bastyr Univer- sity Student Nutrition Association (SNA) is strongly encouraged, and becoming a student member of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is required. A signed verification statement is required to enable students to be eligible for entry into an ac-credited dietetic internship. In order to receive a signed verification statement, 300 nutrition-related volunteer and/or paid hours must first be com-pleted, signed and verified by the DPD director. Second, students must pass the DPD exit exam with a passing grade of 70 percent. Third, students must complete all the required coursework with a graduating cumulative GPA of 3.0. Completion of the DPD program does not guarantee acceptance into a dietetic internship. All other policies and procedures related to the BSN/DPD program are located on MyBU under the Department of Nutri-tion and Exercise Science. Accredit Ation The BS Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) at Bastyr University is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) (120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2000, Chicago, IL, 60606-6995, 800.877.1600, ext. 5400, acend@eatright.org ), a specialized accrediting body recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.

If a student completes the credit requirements for the degree but requires more time to complete the thesis, that student will have two options. Option 1 - The student can register for Thesis Con- tinuation. Thesis Continuation is a 0.0 credit \"course\" that maintains the student's enrollment at Bastyr Uni-versity. The fee for Thesis Continuation is equivalent to School of natural health artS and ScIenceS65 the tuition for one credit. The registration and payment deadlines for Thesis Continuation are the same as those published for regular registration activities. Students who do not register for Thesis Continuation or fail to pay the fee are not permitted to utilize faculty time or other University resources. Option 2 - The student can apply for a leave of absence from the University until s/he are is ready to complete and present the thesis. Students may consult with the Office of the Registrar or see Student Policies and Procedures for details about applying for a leave of absence. Students on a leave of absence are not permit-ted to utilize faculty time or other University resources. When the student is ready to complete and present the thesis, s/he will need to register for Thesis Continuation.

The U.S. Department of Labor defines naturo- pathic physicians as doctors who \"diagnose, treat, and help prevent diseases using a system of practice that is based on the natural healing capacity of individuals. May use physiological, psychological or mechanical methods. May also use natural medi-cines, prescription or legend drugs, foods, herbs, or other natural remedies.\" Most naturopathic physicians provide natural medicine primary care through office-based, pri-vate practice. Many receive additional training in School of naturoP athIc medIcIne76 disciplines or modalities such as acupuncture and Oriental medicine. Naturopathic diagnosis and therapeutics are supported by scientific research drawn from peer-reviewed journals from many disciplines, including naturopathic medicine, conventional medicine, European complementary medicine, clinical nutri-tion, phytotherapy, pharmacognosy, homeopathy, psychology and spirituality. Information technology and new concepts in clinical outcomes assessment are particularly well-suited to evaluating the effec-tiveness of naturopathic treatment protocols and are being used in research, both at naturopathic medical schools and in the offices of practicing physicians. Clinical research into natural therapies has become an increasingly important focus for naturopathic physicians. progrAM outcoMeS A naturopathic medicine graduate of Bastyr University's School of Naturopathic Medicine will: Demonstrate an appropriate level of knowledge in both basic medical and clinical sciences Demonstrate the ability to apply clinical skills in the care of patients to the standards of a primary care naturopathic physician as defined by the profession Demonstrate the ability to apply the philoso- phy and principles of naturopathic medicine in the care of patients Demonstrate a commitment to the highest levels of ethics and professionalism by behaving with honesty and integrity in all interactions with patients, their families, other health care professionals, and others they interact with in the course of their professional career expected leArning outcoMeS A naturopathic medicine graduate of Bastyr University's School of Naturopathic Medicine is expected to be a:I.

The following policy has been adapted from the American Association of Medical Colleges guidelines to ensure that prospective students have the physical and mental capacities to perform the required duties of a naturopathic physician. A candidate for the naturopathic medicine degree must be able to demonstrate appropriate observational and communication skills, motor function, intellectual-conceptual, integrative and quantitative abilities, and behavioral and social maturity. Technological compensation can be made for some disabilities in certain of these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The use of a trained intermediary means that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's power of selection and observation. Observation: The candidate must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to microbiologic cultures and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision and somatic sensation. These are enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. Communication: A candidate must be able to speak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity and posture, and perceive nonverbal School of naturoP athIc medIcIne79 communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor: Candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should be able to do basic laboratory tests (urinalysis, CBC, etc.), re-position a patient, carry out diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and read ECGs and x-rays. A candidate should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways, the suturing of simple wounds, and the performance of simple obstetrical maneuvers. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. Problem solving, a critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes: A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of her/his intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing work loads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admissions and educational processes.AdMiSSionS criteriA The admissions committee of the naturopathic medicine program determines the processes and procedures that guide the selection of candidates for the naturopathic program. The committee reviews undergraduate and graduate (if applicable) academic records and performance in the required prerequisite courses. The personal statement, references, resumes and in-person interviews are also evaluated for evidence of the abilities and skills required of naturopathic physicians. The interview also explores the candidate's awareness of the practice of naturopathic medicine. Bastyr University's naturopathic medicine program is academically challenging. While no minimum GPA is specified, the mean GPA for entering students in the last five years has exceeded 3.3. interviewS Qualified applicants who submit complete ap- plications and meet the prerequisites may be invited to interview. Applicants are expected to interview at the campus to which they apply, either in Kenmore, Washington, or San Diego, California. A limited number of exceptions are made to accommodate special circumstances. trAnSfer Student S Bastyr University accepts transfer students from natu- ropathic, medical, osteopathic and chiropractic schools and other accredited professional programs on a space-available basis. For transfer consideration, credits must be earned from an institution accredited by a regional accrediting agency or from an institution accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). T ransfer students are considered for admis-sion in accordance with the following general guidelines: Applicants must meet the same entrance re- quirements as candidates for the first-year class. Applicants who wish to transfer credits from prior coursework must demonstrate satisfactory completion of courses that are equivalent in con-tent and quality to courses given at the University. Satisfactory completion equals a grade of achieved competency, a C or above, or a 2.0 or above. Applicants must provide an official transcript from the college or program from which the transfer is being requested, demonstrating that they are leaving in good academic standing, and they should be prepared to submit additional documentation to support a thorough evaluation. Transfer applicants must submit a $75 transfer evaluation fee.School of naturoP athIc medIcIne80 AdvAnced StAnding StAtuS BASed on prior MedicAl educA tion Applicants who have completed professional programs may be considered for advanced stand- ing status. Those applicants who graduated from accredited chiropractic, medical or osteopathic col-leges may be eligible for advanced standing in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program. All advanced standing students must complete at least two-thirds of the program and do all of their clinical work at Bastyr University. They are eligible for a maximum of 103 credits toward advanced standing. In those instances where the maximum number of advanced standing transfer credits is granted, it will take a minimum of three years (11 quarters) to complete the program. Placement de-pends upon the amount of coursework completed in the original program, similarity of the course content and credits, age of the courses and perfor-mance in these courses. A student must provide documentation which shows the competencies of the Bastyr University course have been met. Course waivers and/or credit transfers are considered only for those courses in which applicants demonstrate a grade of achieved competence, a C or above, or a 2.0 or above. An exam to determine competency may also be required. Advanced standing applicants must complete all of the course and credit require-ments in effect at the time of their enrollment in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program. Final waiver and/or transfer credit decisions rest with the dean of the school in which the curriculum is taught. Advanced standing is determined on a case by case basis and depends on the type of degree program completed, the courses taken and the number of years in practice. Applicants who are eligible for advanced standing must submit a $75 advanced standing evaluation fee. Applicants must submit a catalog of course descriptions for the years they attended their pro-fessional program and should be prepared to submit additional documentation to support a thorough evaluation. If an advanced standing student is found to be deficient in some area(s) of study, s/he may be required to complete additional courses at Bastyr University. For more information on advanced standing status admission policies and procedures, contact the admissions office.BASic ScienceS curriculuM within nAturop Athic Medicine Basic science modules within the naturopathic medicine program provide integration across sci-ence disciplines and with clinical coursework. First year basic science modules provide a foundation of core principles in anatomy, histology, embryology, biochemistry and physiology that are integrated in the context of body systems. Second year modules use the systems approach to integrate the principles of pathology, immunology and infectious diseases. Throughout the curriculum, science concepts are applied to clinical situations through integrated case discussions. The basic sciences faculty encourages and expects students to advance beyond the simple learning of scientific facts and to integrate systematically the information from basic science disciplines into a unified model of human organization and function. This educational scheme requires students to assume an active role in the learning process and encourages them to adopt this inquisitive behavior for a lifetime. Problem solving, clinical cases and examples are an integral part of the basic science curriculum. This educational process is an expression of Bastyr Uni-versity's basic philosophy of a holistic approach to human behavior, health and therapeutics. The basic sciences faculty encourages students to become to-tally absorbed in an integrated approach to learning and understanding. Instructors are readily available to facilitate this process on an individual basis. The department also offers science courses that satisfy prerequisite requirements, including courses in General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry. counSeling And heAlth pSychology curriculuM within nAturop Athic Medicine The counseling and health psychology cur- riculum serves naturopathic medical students in understanding and effecting change in the emo-tional, mental, and spiritual dimensions of human functioning. The naturopathic medicine program includes six core counseling and health psychology courses. These courses are designed to build the following competencies: Study of the nature and process of healing Development of therapeutic counselor charac - teristics and communication skills Development of comfort in the role of counsel- ing physician and a sense of counseling style and skillSchool of naturoP athIc medIcIne81 Ability to select and implement holistic coun- seling interventions and strategies Ability to assess and stimulate psychological wellness Ability to understand and utilize the body/ mind/spirit interaction in the healing process Ability to assess psychological functioning and make clinical judgments regarding the appropriateness of treating individuals in na-turopathic practice Ability to make appropriate psychological refer- rals Naturopathic principles and cross-cultural per- spectives are woven throughout all counseling and health psychology courses in the naturopathic medicine program. For additional counseling and health psychol- ogy courses available as electives to matriculated students, please see the course listings in this catalog or the current quarterly schedule of classes. Departments Within the Naturopathic Medicine Program BotAnicAl Medicine (For Department of Botanical Medicine Mission and Vision, see page 72.) Botanical medicine is a core modality for naturo- pathic physicians to use in optimizing the health and well-being of their patients. Medicinal plants have been used as food and medicine by all peoples on all continents. The importance of plants to humans has been recorded in cave paintings 60,000 years old. A contemporary renaissance in herbal medicine weds traditional use and wisdom with modern analytical methodologies for optimal medical applications for today. Empirical knowledge of plant therapeutics is based on Western and holistic thought rather than reductionist paradigms and is linked with contempo-rary scientific knowledge. The core curriculum in botanical medicine for naturopathic medical students covers fundamental plant identification and nomenclature, pharmacog-nosy, therapeutic actions, extraction principles, dosage considerations, contraindications, toxicology, herb-drug interactions, clinical applications and treatment regimens. Clinical therapeutics draws from traditional uses, naturopathic formulae and use, and from in-ternational scientific and clinical research, as well as advances in phytotherapy. Several of the materia medica courses are linked with a laboratory experience in the botanical medicine lab on campus. Completion of the required curriculum, along with the required clinical experience, prepares the student for effective and safe clinical utilization of preventive and thera-peutic botanicals. A variety of botanical medicine elective and special topic courses are offered to students in the naturo-pathic medicine program and other programs, along with independent study options. The Bastyr garden is managed by the botanical medicine department, with support from the Uni - versity and donations. It is maintained primarily by a staff garden supervisor and work-study students. The botanical medicine department continues to build an herbarium, although the vast University of Washington herbarium is used as one of Bastyr's teaching venues. The department supports a botanical medicine lab to expand class experience and provide a space for students to continue exploring their work and passion for herbs. hoMeop Athic Medicine Homeopathic medicine is a broad therapeutic modality that is integral to naturopathic medicine. Homeopathy is based on the law of similars. This principle states that a substance that is capable of producing symptoms of disease in a healthy person can cure an ill patient presenting a similar pattern of disease symptoms. Homeopathic medicines stimulate a person's inherent defense mechanism. The entire range of mental, emotional and physi-cal symptoms is considered with each patient. A single medicine is then chosen that addresses the complex pattern of the patient, while emphasizing the uniqueness of the individual. The homeopathic curriculum at Bastyr Univer- sity includes the basic principles and philosophy of homeopathy, materia medica of commonly used homeopathic medicines, use of the homeopathic repertory, taking a homeopathic case, homeopathic case analysis and practical therapeutics for common medical situations. phySicAl Medicine Physical medicine is an integral part of naturo- pathic medicine. It includes various modalities such as hydrotherapy, osseous and soft-tissue manipula-tion, sports medicine and therapeutic exercise. The course of study and clinical training in physical medicine enable students to develop a solid foun-dation for entry into the practice of naturopathic medicine. The curriculum offers sufficient hours in manipulation to satisfy the state of Washington's licensing requirement as a naturopathic physician.School of naturoP athIc medIcIne82 The physical medicine curriculum begins by teaching students the art of touch and palpation, introduction to basic Swedish massage techniques and soft-tissue manipulation, and then progresses to osseous manipulation. SuMMer MASSA ge intenSive Bastyr University and Bellevue Massage School Center for Healing Arts offer students a summer massage training program that allows them to ap-ply coursework taken at Bastyr University toward the Washington state requirements for massage licensure. This course cannot be audited. Students interested in further information may meet with their academic advisor in the registrar's office or with their department's program supervisor to discuss the program availability and the course prerequisites. nAturop Athic Medicine clinic entrAnce prerequiSiteS Naturopathic medicine students must complete and achieve competency in all required classes prior to entering clinical training. Questions about didac-tic prerequisites for clinical ND training should be addressed to the registrar's office on campus. Students must also have completed TB screening, received a hepatitis B vaccination or signed a waiver, have a current CPR card, and submit to a national criminal background check. The criminal background check will be conducted prior to enrolling in clinical shifts. For more information, see \"Background Checks\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual. clinic requireMent S Students in the four-year program will begin clinical training in their first year. Students in the five-year program will begin clinical training in the fall quarter of their second year. Clinical training begins with observation, in which the student fol-lows supervisors through their rotations. The next year clinical training builds to active observation, with clinical skills demonstrated by the student and evaluated by the supervisor. The training supports the students to gradually and continually develop and expand their clinical skills and competence throughout their roles as novice, intermediate and experienced student clinicians. Students are required to successfully complete a minimum of 1,208 hours of clinical training.grAdu Ation requireMent S The curriculum of the naturopathic medicine program requires completion of 309.5 credits for graduation. This includes 252.5 core course credits, 8 elective credits and 49 clinical credits. Students must achieve competency (grade of AC) in all 309.5 credits required in the curriculum. Students must complete all required clinical competencies in order to gradu-ate. Students must complete at least two-thirds of their credits in residence at Bastyr University. electiveS Students in the naturopathic medicine program are required to complete 8 elective credits (included in the 309.5 credit totals) during their course of study. Up to five of these credits may be satisfied by independent study. It is recommended that elective credits be spread out over the length of the student's program. Courses designated as elective and special topics may fulfill this 8-credit requirement, as well as additional clinic shifts during the student's clini-cal training. A maximum of 5 elective credits from any one discipline may be used to satisfy the natu-ropathic medicine program elective requirement. The rule of a 5-credit maximum does not apply to elective credits being taken to satisfy waived credits. Elective credits covering waived course credits may be from any discipline. A student may take elective credits from any program/department. nAturop Athic Medicine progrAM trAckS Students who are accepted into the program and decide not to complete the program in four years must choose one of the following approved options: Extended Track-Option Extended Dual-Track OptionAt the time of enrollment, most naturopathic medicine students are registered for the four-year track. Students who wish to change to an extended track must complete the ND change of status form (available in the registrar's office) and then meet with an advisor/evaluator, room 249. Changes may affect financial aid packages as well as the sequencing of courses. Naturopathic medicine students wanting to add a second program must switch to the extended dual track. As long as a student remains on an approved program track, there will be no course-scheduling conflicts. Students must remain on track in order to graduate on time. Students may not register off track or register ahead of track without approval from the dean's office.School of naturoP athIc medIcIne83 For additional information regarding combining naturopathic medicine with acupuncture and Oriental medicine, counseling psychology or midwifery, please contact the admissions office.

This requires a formal application to the acupuncture and Oriental medicine program through the admissions department, followed by a joint interview by both the AOM and ND schools. ND students who are considering applying to the School of AOM as their second program are strongly encouraged to be enrolled as four-year track students during their first two years of attendance. In essence, the dual-track program requires that students have successfully completed their pre-clinical ND training before they add a second degree program. Students who are accepted into the AOM program must switch their naturopathic program to the five-year track in order to carry a combined program load. Students with advanced medical training, e.g., DC, DO or MD, must successfully complete the first year of study in their original program before acceptance into dual status. Dual program applicants are able to utilize their basic science coursework in the natu-ropathic program toward their MSA or MSAOM. Please note that some states require Chinese herbal training for acupuncture licensure. Please see the School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine master's program description for complete informa-tion on degree and licensing requirements. duAl-trAck elective credit S ND/MSAOM students must complete ten elec- tive credits. ND/MSA students must complete 13 elective credits. For all dual-track students, five of the elective credits must be from disciplines other than OM or CH. If a dual-track student has waived a required course from either program, core course credit from the opposite program cannot be used to cover the waiver. Use of core credits would result in a shortage of overall credits. The following curriculum tables list the ten- tative schedule of courses each quarter. Next to each course is the number of credits per course (Crdt.), the lecture hours each week (Lec.), the lab/clinic hours each week (L/C) and the total School of naturoP athIc medIcIne87 contact hours for the course over the entire quarter (Tot). doctor of nAturop Athic Medicine / MASter of Science in Acupuncture (MSA) or Acupuncture And orient Al Medicine (MSA oM) 2012-2013 Note: Since a naturopathic medicine student enters the dual program after completion of the second year of the NM program, the curriculum that follows reflects the NM curriculum from the 2010/2011 catalog and the MSA/MSAOM curriculum from the 2012-2013 catalog.

This requires a formal application to the counseling and health psychology program through the admissions department, followed by a joint interview by both the counseling and health psychology department and the ND school. ND students who are considering applying to the counseling psychology master's program as their second program are strongly encouraged to be enrolled as four-year track students during their first two years of attendance. In essence, the dual-track program requires that students have successfully completed their pre-clinical ND training before they add a second degree program. Students who are accepted into the MACP program must switch their naturopathic program to the extended track in order to carry a combined program load. nAturop Athic Medicine /Midwifery duAl trAck Students in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program who are academically in good standing have the opportunity to apply to the Master of Science in Midwifery (MSMW) program in February of their second year of the four-year track. This requires a formal application to the Department of Midwifery through the admissions department, followed by an interview for qualified applicants by the admissions committee of the Department of Midwifery. ND students who are considering applying to the Department of Midwifery as their second program are strongly encouraged to be enrolled as four-year track students during their first two years of atten-dance. In essence, this dual-track program requires that students have successfully completed their pre-clinical ND training before they add a second degree program. Students who are accepted into the Midwifery program must subsequently switch their naturopathic program to the extended track in order to carry a combined program load. Please see the department of midwifery's program overview for complete information on education objectives and blended curriculum model. Because this model entails mandatory intensive onsite at-tendance, dual-track students will need to have ND courses that meet during those times videotaped with the assistance of the ND department. The following curriculum tables list the ten- tative schedule of courses each quarter. Next to each course are the number of credits per course (Crdt.), the lecture hours each week (Lec.), the lab/clinic hours each week (L/C) and the total contact hours for the course over the entire quarter (Tot). fAculty with higheSt degreeS , licenSeS oBtAined And depArtMent Al AffiliA tion Key (AOM) Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine (BS) Basic Sciences (BTM) Botanical Medicine (EXS) Exercise Science (HO) Homeopathy (HS) Herbal Sciences (IS) Interdisciplinary Studies (MW) Midwifery(NM) Naturopathic Medicine (NTR) Nutrition(PM) Physical Psychology Brammer, Debra, ND, Bastyr University (NM) Bradley, Ryan, ND, (MA, Bastyr University (NM, PM)Littleton, Kent, ND, Bastyr MS, Washington (BS) Mann, Richard, ND, Bastyr University (HO)Martzen, Mark, PhD, University of South Dakota School of Medicine (BS) Messner, Don, PhD, University of Washington (BS)Modell, Harold, PhD, University of Mississippi Medical Center (BS) Neary, Dean E., Jr, ND, Bastyr University (PM, NM)Olehausen, Joni, ND, National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NM) Parkinson, Andrew, ND, Bastyr University (NM)Raymer, Katherine, ND, MD, Southwest College of Natu- ropathic Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine (NM) Rosen, Daniel, PhD, Arizona State University (PSY) Rubinstein, Joshua, ND, Bastyr University (NM)Spicer, Diane, MIT, University of versity of Wisconsin (BS) Standish, Leanna, ND, Bastyr University of Massachusetts, LAc (NM) Staruch, Arianna, ND, National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NM) Steward, Rebecca Love, DVM, Washington State Univer- sity (BS) Takakura, Masahiro, ND, LAc, Bastyr University, DC, National College of Chiropractic (PM) Thomas, Aleyamma, PhD, University of Manitoba (BS) Wallace, James, ND, Bastyr University (NM) Wenner, Cynthia, PhD, Washington University, (BS) Eric, ND, RH, University (NM)Anderson, ND, National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NM) Auerbach, Marisha, BA, The Evergreen State College (CHLD) Anderson, Robert, MD, University of Washington (NM)Barry, David, ND, DC, Bastyr Nancy, Johns Hopkins University (BS)Berman, Lisa, Heilpraktiker, Berlin University (HS)Boehnlein, David, BS, University of Minnesota - T win Cit- ies (CHLD) of Naturopathic Medicine (NM) Elmore, \"Durr\" Nesbitt, ND, DC, National College of Evershed, ND, Deborah, ND, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, RN, Edward J.

All students in the Doctor of Naturopathic Medi- cine program (ND), Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine program (DAOM), Master of Science in Acupuncture program (MSA), Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine program (MSAOM), Master of Nutrition program (MSN/CHP and MSN/DPD), Certificate in Chi-nese Herbal Medicine program (CCHM), and BS Didactic Program in Dietetics (BSN/DPD) receive clinical training at Bastyr Center for Natural Health - Team Care. The program deans/chairs or their designates in conjunction with the clinic medical director oversee the clinical education and training of the students and work closely with each program's lead administrator. The clinical training in Team Care is modeled upon mentorship. The average faculty/student ratio is 1:6, which includes three primary clinicians and three observing clinicians. Each student pair is assigned to a room throughout the quarter. Each clinic shift begins with case preview during which the students present to the supervisor their prepara - tions for the patients they will see that day. During each patient visit, the supervisor spends time in the room with the student team and the patient. Also, during each visit, the supervisor and student team discuss the patient in the consult rooms, reviewing the assessments and treatment recommendations. Each clinic shift concludes with case review where all the students and supervisors meet jointly to discuss selected cases seen that day. Clinical course numbers and descriptions for each program's required and elective clinical offerings are found in the course description section of the catalog under the appropriate program heading. The narrative section of the catalog provides further information regarding clinical training under each program and curriculum section. Students in each program receive a Bastyr Center for Natural Health Student Clinician Handbook prior to entering clinical training. This required manual serves as the student's clinic textbook and contains information on clinical education requirements, policies and procedures, learning objectives and clinical competencies. External clinical training opportunities have been developed for each program, in order to provide a broader educational experience for students. At each external site, Bastyr faculty supervises the student clinicians. For a description of these sites, see Bastyr Center facilities listing on page 13 in this catalog. Students have a preceptorship requirement in which they work with a variety of licensed, prac-ticing health care professionals in various practice settings. These placements provide students with valuable clinical experience. The combination of external training sites, the preceptor experience and clinical rotations in the main clinic assures diversity in each student's clinical experience. Bastyr Center for Natural Health has a well-estab- lished CNME-credentialed naturopathic residency program, with positions both at Bastyr Center for Natural Health and numerous external sites. Currently, there are eight naturopathic residency positions at Bastyr Center for Natural Health. These programs are highly competitive and attract gradu-ates from other educational institutions as well as from Bastyr. The residency programs at Bastyr are closely supervised programs of mentorship. Each resident progresses from a purely observational role into an independent role over the course of the year. This progression is monitored and facilitated by a faculty mentor and by the director of the Office of Graduate and Community Medicine. A second year of residency offers clinical supervision and continued skill development. All residents have multiple opportunities to do rotations in other lo-cal clinics. The director of the Office of Graduate and Community Medicine is responsible for the administration, development and expansion of the naturopathic residency program. The University is committed to the goal of providing residency op-portunities for every graduate.94 Curriculum and course changes in the 2012-2013 Bastyr University Catalog are applicable to students entering during the 2012-2013 academic year.

keeping with federal refund requirements for students withdrawing from school: Week of the % Refund % Refund for Quarter for Course Complete Withdrawals1 Withdrawals2 1st 100% 100% 2nd 5th 25% 60% 6th 25% 50% 7th through 8th 0 0 Refunds related to course and full withdrawal from summer quarter are different and published in the summer quarter academic calendar, available on MyBU. After the first week of the quarter, course withdrawals are accompanied by a \"W\" grade on the transcript (except in the case of courses that have not yet begun). 1All courses (including weekend intensive courses) follow this refund schedule. Courses may not be dropped after the course has ended (example: week-end intensive and non-traditionally scheduled courses). Courses may only be added in the first week of the quarter (with the exception of weekend intensive courses). In order to manage patient sched-uling, the University strongly discourages students from dropping clinic shifts. Students who drop a clinic shift before the quarter may be assessed a fi-nancial penalty. Once the quarter has begun, there is no refund for shift withdrawals (except in the case of family or medical emergencies). Please see the clinic registration staff, in the registrar's office, for more information regarding clinic shift changes. 2Calculated by hand.federal refund requIrement S156 Academic Calendar For 2012-2013 FALL 2012 WTR 2013 SP 2013 SU 2013 Orientation 9/11-14 for ND students, 9/18-19 for other students Classes Start for First-Year Midwifery Students Classes 7/8 (Clinic 7/1) Convocation 9/24 (9:00 a.m.) Last Day to Withdraw with a W Grade 11/16 3/1 5/31 8/16 Classes End Midwifery and MSN Programs 2/1 Priority Applications Due - All other BS and Master's Programs 3/15 Financial Aid Application Priority Due Date 4/1academIc calendar 1In fall quarter only, first-year naturopathic medicine classes begin a week earlier to accommodate midterms week, when students take exams but do not have other scheduled classes. Midterms are tentatively scheduled for 10/22-26/12. 2Students earning PCs in Naturopathic Medicine modules in year one and two will need to return to campus before the start of the following quarter to complete remediation exams and exercises. 3During interim clinic, all clinic services run normally. Interim clinic is required; exceptions must be approved in advance. Students staff the shifts in which they were registered in the quarter just ended. 4During clinic closure, the clinic does not offer patient visits, but appointment phones and dispensary are open (except when one of the clinic closure days falls on a paid holiday). Appointment phones and dispensary hours may be altered from their standard operating hours. The clinic is closed on all official University holidays. 5Bastyr Community Day is focused on the health and well-being of members of the Bastyr community. Activities are scheduled for the afternoon and classes and clinic shifts are cancelled from noon to 5 p.m. so that members of the com-munity can participate. 6Although religious holidays are NOT official University holidays, the University's policy is to attempt to accommodate the observance of religious practices. Students are responsible for the material covered but will not have religious absences count against any attendance requirement. Students observing such holidays are required to notify faculty during the first week of classes and find substitutes for clinic shifts affected. Students should follow the reschedule exam procedures in the event an exam falls on a religious holiday. Major religious holidays in the coming academic year that occur when the University is in session are 9/17/12, 9/26/12, 10/26/12 and 8/8/13. Bastyr University schedules clinical training and occasional required courses or intensives on weekends. Students who have religious restrictions against attending classes on weekends must contact their program chair or dean, in advance, when such a conflict occurs. Efforts will be made to resolve such conflicts, but a resolution cannot be guaranteed.

Recognizing that funding, policies, personnel and curricula may change, Bastyr University reserves the right to change, without prior notice, academic programs, courses, faculty, fees, policies and the academic calendar regulating admissions, registration, graduation and any other matters affecting the student body.Nothing contained in this catalog shall constitute a contract, expressed or implied, between applicants or students and Bastyr University. The administration shall, at all times, retain the authority to withdraw from the University any student who fails to attain and maintain established levels of academic or clinical performance or who does not exhibit the personal and professional conduct required for the practice of medicine or related disciplines.In meeting its professional educational requirements, Bastyr University is committed to its obligation to maintain a healthy environment commensurate with the standards set by federal, state or local regulatory agencies in the normal operations of its classrooms, laboratories and clinical and research facilities. Students should be aware, however, that people training for health care professions may be exposed to diseases and potentially toxic environments to a much greater extent than the general public.Bastyr University is an equal opportunity institution.
