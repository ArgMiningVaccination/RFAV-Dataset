Today, acupuncturists take extremely sharp needles and insert them into various places on the body, to regulate Qi (energy), and stimulate physical and mental self-healing mechanisms. An illness can be caused by blockage of Qi. Qi is an invisible network of energy that the body has. When the network is blocked, sections of the body deteriorate. By applying acupuncture in the right places, it will restore energy flow , and the network and body will return to normal. Acupuncture also stimulates parts of the body to self-heal. It releases various form of stress, activates the immune system, and accelerates tissue healing. Even when acupuncture needles are removed, the effects can last for several days.
