No homeopathic treatments have been proven to be effective at stopping diarrhea. Therefore, you should not replace standard medical care with homeopathic approaches. While you might want to use homeopathy in conjunction with standard care, keep in mind that if diarrhea is not treated properly, you could develop severe dehydration and rapid electrolyte loss. These complications are especially a concern in children. Blanchi Costela / Getty Images This article explains some of the substances used in homeopathy and information on how these substances may have been shown to help with diarrhea as homeopathic treatments or in other forms. If you are experiencing diarrhea symptoms, it's important to consult your healthcare provider. Persistent, severe, or bloody diarrhea should be evaluated immediately by a healthcare provider. Aloe Homeopathic practitioners recommend aloe vera to ease diarrhea accompanied by gas. Symptoms in these cases may include gurgling and rumbling in the abdomen before bowel movements along with involuntary stools while passing gas. While there is no evidence showing homeopathic aloe vera is effective, there is some evidence that aloe can help in other forms. For instance, some people find that aloe vera juice helps ease diarrhea and accompanying gas, and research shows that taking oral aloe vera for short periods of time may help with diarrhea and other symptoms of IBS. There is also research showing that topical aloe vera ointment may help relieve diarrhea side effects that result from radiotherapy treatments. Aloe Vera and Ulcerative Colitis Arsenicum Album Used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms related to food poisoning, Arsenicum album is a popular homeopathic remedy for travelers. You can take it at the onset of symptoms such as foul-smelling diarrhea accompanied by extreme tiredness, nausea, and vomiting. You can also use it to prevent these symptoms. COVID-19 Arsenicum album has shown some success as a treatment for COVID-19 symptoms, but more research is needed. Ipecacuanha Ipecacuanha is commonly kept in medicine cabinets in the form of ipecac syrup. Traditionally, this was used to treat poisoning in children because it induces vomiting. However, some people also think that as a homeopathic treatment, it can ease severe diarrhea, frothy or green stools, sharp pains, and frequent bowel movements. Phosphorus Phosphorus is important for building and maintaining bones and teeth and regulating numerous body functions. In homeopathy, phosphorus may be given as a remedy for someone with diarrhea who also experiences exhaustion without pain. It may be recommended specifically for people who have diarrhea with thirst and a weak, empty feeling in their stomach. Sleep and cold drinks or food may be recommended along with the homeopathic treatment. Staying hydrated, replenishing with electrolytes, eating bland foods, and resting are standard self-care recommendations for adults with diarrhea. Podophyllum As a homeopathic treatment for gastrointestinal symptoms, podophyllum is said to relieve watery, urgent, profuse, and explosive diarrhea accompanied by much gas. This type of diarrhea may bring on severe cramping. Sulfur Sulfur is often used in homeopathy for diarrhea that comes with an urgent need to have a bowel movement, especially in the morning. There are no studies that show the effectiveness of sulfur on these symptoms, but as long as you avoid taking high doses of sulfur, there should not be problems. If you're considering the use of homeopathy (or any form of alternative medicine), make sure to consult your healthcare provider first. Self-treating a condition and avoiding or delaying standard care may have serious consequences.
