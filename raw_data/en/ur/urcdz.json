An automated clinical decision support tool pro- vides actionable and up-to-date information at the point of care to reduce missed opportunities for vaccination of adolescents regardless of when they engage in care. The purpose of this study is to determine the degree to which vaccine delivery following a vaccine computerized clinical decision support system (CCDSS) varied by patient characteristics (age, gender, and number of vac- cines due) and visit characteristics (preventive vs. problem focused). Methods: We implemented a CCDSS in a single urban teaching clinic where residents, adolescent medicine fellows, and nursepractitioners provide pediatric primary care, adolescent medi- cine and HIV specialty care. This tool provided an alert to providers, using the clinic 's electronic medical platform, when adolescents ages 11-21 were due for any recommended vaccine, based on standard Center for Disease Control & Prevention schedules. These alerts were triggered for all types of visits, including acute visits. We examined factors associated with vaccination including age (using following age categories: 11-12, 13-17, and \u00bc18); gender; type and number of vaccines due; and visit type using chi-squared and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: In a 15-month period, 5943 alerts for vaccines due were sent during 3,672 visits among 1,936 unique patients. The number of alerts per visit ranged from 1-5 vaccines (Mean 1.6, SD 0.89). Alerts were most common for HPV (47.7%) and Hepatitis B (2.2%), (1.7%) were less common. Overall, 45.8% of reminders resulted in vaccine administration at that visit. Response rates were highest for younger adolescents (55.3% for ages 11-12, compared to 47.1% for ages 13-17 and 34.1% for those \u00bc18, p\u00bc<0.001), and higher for males than females (51.4% vs. 40.5%, p \u00bc<0.001). Response rates were highest when patients were due for 3 vaccines (57.6%) and lowest when patients were due for only 1 vaccine (42.5%) (p <0.001). In the nal adjusted model, males had a 46% greater odds to receive vaccinesin response to alerts than females (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.28-1.67), while older adolescents were less likely to receive vaccinations as compared to 11-12 year olds (13-17yo: OR Patients requiring 2 or 3 vac- cinations were more likely to receive them than those requiring only 1 (OR 1.40, (95% CI 1.17-1.67) and OR 1.58 (95% CI 1.29-1.92) respectively). Provider response to CCDSS did not differ by visit type in nal model. Conclusions: The use of an electronic alert system for adolescents has potential for improving vaccine administration by promoting vaccination during early adolescence and targeting certain groups that would otherwise be missed by vaccines targeting only fe- males. Additional efforts may need to be used to promote vacci- nation in older adolescents.

FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH EARLY UPTAKE AND SERIES COMPLETION OF HPV VACCINATION IN MALE AND FEMALE ADOLESCENTS Randi Teplow-Phipps, MD 1, Vassiliki (Vikki) Papadouka, PhD2, Denise H. Karen Soren, MD, FSAHM4, Melissa Stockwell, MD, MPH4.1NYPH, Columbia University Medical Center;2Citywide Immunization Registry, NYC Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene; 3NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene;4Columbia University Medical Center. Purpose: To assess the impact of gender-speci c human papillo- mavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations and demographic characteristics on: (1) early uptake, (2) coverage, and (3) series completion for males and females.Methods: We analyzed HPV vaccination for 11-18 year-olds using the Citywide Immunization Registry (CIR), a database containing vaccinations administered in New York City. Initiation was de ned as receipt of >\u00bc1 dose, and timely completion as >\u00bc3 doses within 12-months of initiation. Patient-speci c variables included age, gender, and insurance status. Practice-speci c variables included practice-type, number of Tdap vaccines reported (proxy for prac- tice size), and percent poverty in practice location. We evaluated factors associated with early initiation (within 1 year of routine gender-speci c recommendations [females: 3/23/07, the CIR from 2005- 2012, 50.2% were male, 56.7% received their vaccines in private practices, 57.9% in practices in the highest tertile of adolescent patient population size, and 46.9% in practices in the highest poverty tertile areas. Of all 13-18 year-olds as of July 2013, 47.2% received >\u00bc1 dose, with 44.3% initiating at <\u00bc12 years, 41.6% at 13-15 years, and 14.1% at 16-18 years. Within one year of routine recommendations for their gender, 28.8% of 13-18 year-old fe- males vs. 29.3% of males had initiated vaccination. Both males and females had signi cantly greater odds of early uptake if they were publicly insured, seen at a practice with moderate-to-large number of adolescents, and/or at a public hospital/community health clinic (PH/CHC) or private hospital (adjusted odds ratios (AORs) range 1.29-2.22; 95% CI range for all AORs 1.26, 2.29). Being seen at a practice in a high vs. low poverty area was associated with early uptake for males (AOR 1.61; 95% CI 1.57, 1.66) but lower uptake for females (AOR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93, 0.99). Half of those who initiated HPV vaccination in 2011 were male; of those who initiated, females were more likely to complete within 12 months (females 38.4% vs. males 35.7%; p <0.0001). For both genders, those seen at low or mid-level poverty area practices or practices with more adolescents had greater odds of completion (AORs range 1.09-1.29; 95% CI range 1.02,1.41); those seen at a private hospital vs. private practice and those unin- sured had lower odds of completion (AORs range 0.75-0.88; 95% CI range 0.71, 0.93). However, males seen at PH/CHC were more likely than those seen at private practice to complete (AOR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05, 1.16). Conclusions: Despite the pre-existence of permissive recom- mendations for males, male uptake in the rst year after routine recommendation was similar to that of females in their rst year post-routine recommendations. While males seen in higher poverty areas were more likely to initiate, both males and fe- males from those areas were less likely to complete the HPV vaccine series. Similarly, although both genders seen in private practices were less likely to initiate, females seen at those practices were more likely to complete, while males were less likely. In 2011, half of those initiating HPV vaccination were male. Completion rates for both genders remained below Healthy People 2020 targets.Sources of Support: CUMC Adolescent Medicine Fellowship.Platform Abstracts / 54 (2014) S1 eS16 S12 brought to you by CORE View metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk provided by Elsevier - Publisher Connector "}
