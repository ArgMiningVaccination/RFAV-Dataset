Real-world data on heterologous boosting with messenger RNA (mRNA)-1273 (Moderna) after inactivated COVID-19 vaccination are limited. We report mRNA-1273 boosting in heavily SARS-CoV-2 -exposed Indonesian health- care workers who received a two-dose CoronaVac 6 months prior. Between August and November 2021, we measured SARS-CoV-2 spike-speci c IgG binding antibody (Bab) titers in all 304 participants, and neutralizing antibody titers in a random subset of 71 participants, on stored paired serum samples taken before and 28 days after a full-dose (100- mg) mRNA-1273 booster. At the time of the mRNA-1273 boost, 107 participants (35.2%) were not previously infected (naive vaccinated), 42 (13.8%) were infected before CoronaVac (infected vaccinated), and 155 (51.0%) were infected after CoronaVac (mostly during the Delta wave; vaccinated infected). At time of the mRNA-1273 boost, neutralizing antibodiescould still be detected in 83% of participants (59 of 71) overall, 60% of naive-vaccinated participants (15 of 25), 95.7% of vaccinated-infected participants (22 of 23), and 95.7% of infected vaccinated participants (22 of 23). After the mRNA-1273 boost, 100% of participants (71 of 71) had neutralizing antibody activity, with increases in median Bab andneutralizing antibody serum titers of and in vaccinated-infected participants. In the multivariable analysis, Bab titers after the mRNA-1273 boost were greatest in individuals who had a previous virus break- through post-CoronaVac, and when a longer time period ( .4 months) had elapsed since the most recent prior \"spike antigen exposure \"(either second CoronaVac or virus breakthrough). Overall, adverse reactions were mild and short- lived. In conclusion, a full-dose mRNA-1273 booster after CoronaVac was well tolerated and immunogenic after 28 days, including in those with very low antibody levels. INTRODUCTION Vaccination is a key global strategy to control the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, eight COVID-19 vaccines have received an Emergency Use Listing by the WHO, 1most of which require a two-dose regimen. Accumulating evidence shows aprogressive increase in breakthrough infections over time since the second dose, which is associated with diminishing humoral immunity. 2-5Neutralization and vaccine effective- ness after two-dose vaccine schedules are particularly reduced for the recent Omicron variant (B.1.1.529),6but with signi cant restoration after a third vaccine booster dose.7-11 Recent trials suggested that heterologous (or \"mix and match \") virus-vectored or messenger RNA (mRNA) booster strategies were more immunogenic than a homologous schedule,12-16 albeit with increased reactogenicity in some combinations.17 CoronaVac (SinoVac Life Sciences Co. Ltd., Beijing, China), an inactivated whole-virus vaccine that received WHO Emer- gency Use Listing on June 1, 2021,18is among the most widely administered COVID-19 vaccines worldwide, with more than 2 billion doses in 54 countries as of March 2022. Vaccine ef cacy against symptomatic illness 50.5% to 83.5% in randomized trials.18-20 Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and COVID-19 -related death was reported at87.5%, 90.3%, and 86.3%, respectively, based on real-world data from Chile.21However, recent studies reported Corona- Vac to have lower immunogenicity than virus vector or mRNA vaccines,22,23a pronounced decrease of neutralizing anti- body titers within few months,23-25and reduced effective- ness in the elderly.26,27 CoronaVac has been the predominant vaccine rolled out in Indonesia 's countrywide mass vaccination campaign, which has seen the second highest number of COVID-19 cases (5,910,000) and deaths (153,000) in Asia (as of March 15, 2022).28Frequent breakthrough infections during the second, Delta-driven wave in July 2021 prompted the Ministry of Health to offer a heterologous booster of full-dose (100- mg) mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna Inc., Cambridge, MA) to front- line health-care workers. Recent studies in individuals withno history of laboratory-con rmed COVID-19 found that an mRNA booster of BNT162b2 (P zer-BioNTech) after primary vaccination with CoronaVac was well tolerated and induced elevated, virus-speci c antibody levels and potent neutraliza- tion activity, including against the Omicron variant, albeit to a lesser extent. 8-11However, real-world data are limited on mRNA-1273 as the booster as well as on \"hybrid immunity \" induced by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.29 We therefore established the Indonesia Vaccine Immunity & Infection Evaluation (INVITE) study, which included an assess- ment of a full-dose (100- mg) mRNA-1273 booster dose given 6 CoronaVac among heavily SARS- CoV-2 -exposed health-care We documented the antispike (anti-S) IgG binding antibody (Bab)*Address correspondence to 69, neutralizing antibody (Nab) responses and reactogenicity of this booster, and examined the effects of previous SARS- CoV-2 infections occurring before or after primary CoronaVac vaccination. MATERIALS AND METHODS Design and population. The INVITE study is a longitudinal observational cohort that includes health-care workers (doctors, nurses, and clinical laboratory analysts) who are18 years or older at St Carolus and Pasar Minggu hospitals in Jakarta. We enrolled participants consecutively on the day they received their government-provided 100- mgm R N A - 1273 booster dose at their own hospital, between August 5and October 15, 2021. Eligible staff for the booster were those who had completed their two-dose primary vaccination at least 6 months prior, had no known recent ( ,3m o n t h s ) SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had no other contraindication for vaccination. Our analysis included all study participants for whom a paired pre- and postbooster serum sample wasavailable. All participants provided written informed consent. Procedures. Basic demographic and clinical data were captured on an online case report form. Solicited signs of local or systemic reactogenicity during the 7 days after the boosterdose were recorded in a daily patient diary and, after study physician veri cation, were graded for severity (mild, moder- ate, severe, or disrupting activities of daily living [ADLs]). Previ-ous COVID-19 was de ned as a documented polymerase chain reaction -conrmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and participants were thus categorized as not previously SARS-CoV 2-infected (na\u00efve vaccinated), SARS-CoV-2 -infected before the Corona- Vac primary vaccination (infected vaccinated), or infected after the CoronaVac primary vaccination (vaccinated infected, also known as Delta breakthrough). Venous blood samples weredrawn on the day of the booster dose before administrationand 28 ( 110) days thereafter (Supplemental Figure 1). Serum was stored at -80 /C14C and titers of against SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) on the Architect i2000sr platform in accor-dance with the manufacturer 's instructions, and expressed in WHO International Standard binding antibody units (BAU) per milliliter using the manufacturer 's conversion factor (1 BAU/mL 50.1423arbitrary and seroposi- tivity de ned as $7.1 BAU/mL. 30Samples with results greater than the upper limit of quanti cation were tested again after dilution. To validate the Bab measurements,we also measured Nabs using the SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (cPass; GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions, converted to WHO international units per milliliter for SARS-CoV-2 neutral-ization assays, 31in a random subset of the three participant groups. The cutoff value for Nabs was de ned as 28 IU/mL or 30% signal inhibition.31,32 Statistical analysis. Paired comparisons of Bab and Nab titers before and after the mRNA-1273 booster dose were performed using the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed-ranktest. Correlations of log 10titers the Spearman coef cient ( rs). Multivariable ordinal (proportional odds) logistic regression was performed to assess factors associated with pre- and postboost log 10-transformed Babtiters (categorized in quartiles). Multivariable logistic regres- was performed to assess factors associated with occur- rence of any severe or disrupting adverse reactions. The independent variables included in the analysis were age,gender, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, timing of previousSARS-CoV-2 infection before or after CoronaVac primary vaccination, any comorbidity (cardiovascular disease includ- ing hypertension, obesity [body mass index .30 kg/m 2], diabetes mellitus, and asthma), preboost Bab titer, timeinterval between the rst and second CoronaVac dose, and time interval between the second CoronaVac and mRNA- 1273 booster dose. A two-sided P,0.05 was considered signi cant. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata/IC version 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). RESULTS Participant characteristics. There were 304 of 353 par- ticipants (86.1%) with complete pre- and post-booster sam- ple pairs who were included in the analysis. The median age was 31 years (interquartile range [IQR], 27 -44 years; range, 21-59 years), 235 (77.3%) were women, and 61 (20.1%) had one or more comorbidities, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and asthma (Table 1). One hun- dred seven participants (35.2%) were na\u00efve vaccinated, 42(13.8%) were infected vaccinated, and 155 (51.0%) werevaccinated infected. The mRNA-1273 booster was given at a median of 190 days (IQR, 165 -232 days) after the second CoronaVac dose. Antibody titers before and after mRNA-1273 booster. The proportion of Bab-seropositive participants increased from 96.4% ( n5293) before receiving the mRNA-1273 booster (which was /C246 months after receiving CoronaVac, as described earlier) to 100% ( n5304) after boosting (Table 1). After receiv- ing the mRNA-1273 booster, the median Bab titer increased 9.3-fold overall, from (Figure 1, Supplemental Figure 2). Supplemental Figure 2 and Supplemental Table 1 summarize pre- and post-mRNA-1273 boost titers by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, age, gen-der, and presence of any comorbidity. At the time of the mRNA-1273 boost, Nab activity could still be detected in 83% of participants overall (59 of 71), in 60%of the naive-vaccinated (15 of 25), 95.7% of the vaccinated- infected (22 of 23), and 95.7% of the infected-vaccinated (22 of 23). After receiving the mRNA-1273 boost, 100% (71 of 71)had Nab activity, after mRNA-1273 booster. Pre-mRNA-1273 boost Bab titers var- ied widely, from 0.97 to 21,466 BAU/mL (4.35 log 10range), and were greater in those previously infected (Figures 2 and 3). More recent spike antigen exposure, either by the CoronaVacsecond dose or breakthrough infection (whichever was mostrecent), correlated with greater pre-mRNA-1273 boost Baband Nab titers (Figures 1 and 2). Vaccinated-infected partici-pants had the shortest time since most recent spike antigenexposure, and had a greater pre-mRNA-1273 boost Bab titerthan either infected-vaccinated or naive-vaccinated partici-pants (Figure 2). All participants reached substantial boost titers, ranging between 364 and195,452 IU/mL (2.65 log 10range) for Nabs (Figures 1 and 3, Supplemental Figure 2). Pre-mRNA-1273 boost Bab titers correlated signi cantly infected-vaccinated participants (r s50.3531, P50.5993) and vaccinated-infected participants (rs5-0.1294, P50.5561) (Supplemental Figure 3). Factors associated with pre- and postbooster Bab titers In multivariable analysis, previous SARS-CoV-2 infec- tion either before or after the CoronaVac primary vaccinationwas strongly associated with a greater preboost Bab titer(P50.001 and P,0.0001, respectively) and, as expected, pre-mRNA-1273 boost Bab titers were lower when a longerperiod of time ( .3 months) had elapsed since the most recent prior spike antigen exposure (either the second Coro-naVac dose or a breakthrough infection) compared with amore recent exposure. Post-mRNA-1273 boost Bab titers were greater in partici- pants who had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection after theCoronaVac primary vaccination (i.e., virus breakthrough),and when a longer period of time ( .4 months) had elapsed since the most recent prior spike antigen exposure (eitherTABLE 1 Participants characteristics CharacteristicTotal (N5304)Naive vaccinated (n5155) 31 (27 -44) 30 (26 -43) 32 (28 -46) 31 (27 -45) 21-29,n(%) 134 (44.1) 52 (48.6) 12 (28.6) 70 (45.2) 30-39,n(%) 68 (22.4) 21 (19.6) 18 (42.9) 29 (18.7) 40-49,n(%) 57 (18.8) 23 (21.5) 4 (9.5) 30 (19.3) 50-59,n(%) 45 (14.8) 11 (10.3) 8 (19.0) 26 (16.8) Gender Women, n(%) 235 (77.3) 83 (77.6) 30 (71.4) 122 (78.7) Men, n(%) 69 (22.7) 24 (22.4) 12 (28.6) 33 (21.3) No. of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections, n(%) 0 107 (35.2) 107 (100.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0)1 176 (57.9) 0 (0.0) 27 (64.3) 149 (96.1)2 21 (6.9) 0 (0.0) 15 (35.7) 6 (3.9) Comorbidities, n(%) No 243 (79.9) 88 (82.2) 34 (81.0) 121 (78.1)Yes 61 (20.1) 19 (17.8) 8 (19.0) 34 (21.9) Obesity 39 (12.9) 13 (12.2) 6 (14.3) 20 (12.9) Cardiovascular disease (including hypertension)20 (6.6) 6 (5.6) 2 (4.8) 12 (7.7) Asthma 7 (2.3) 2 (1.9) 1 (2.4) 4 (2.6) Diabetes mellitus 4 (1.3) 2 (1.9) 1 (2.4) 1 (0.7) Data before mRNA-1273 booster dose (day 0) Interval between rst and second CoronaVac dose, days; median (IQR)14 (14 -17) 14 (14 -17) 28 (14 -31) 14 (14 -14) Interval between second CoronaVac dose and mRNA-1273 booster, days;median (IQR)190 (165 -190) 137 (94 -153) 229 (196 -241) Interval between the most recent spike exposure* and mRNA-1273 booster, days; median (IQR)104 (89 177 92 -101) Bab titer, BAU/mL; median (IQR) 250 (32 -1.389) 32 (99.4) after mRNA-1273 booster dose (day 28) Interval between mRNA-1273 booster and day 28 Bab measurement, days; median (IQR)34 (31 -36) 35 (34 -39) 35 (31 -43) 31 (29 -34) (100) 155 (100) Bab5binding antibody; BAU 5binding antibody units range; mRNA 5messenger RNA. *D ened as either CoronaVac second dose or breakthrough infection, whichever occurred most recently.

Reactogenicity of mRNA-1273 booster. The 304 partici- pants reported a total of 300 adverse reactions within 7 days after receiving the mRNA-1273 booster. The percentage of participants with any solicited adverse reaction was 98.7%(n5300), 96.4% ( n5293) for any local reaction (injection site pain and swelling most frequent), and 90.8% ( n5276) for any systemic reaction (myalgia, fever/chills, and head-ache being most frequent). Most solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were mild ( n586, 28.3%) or moderate (n5131, ( n524, 7.9%) were less common (Figure 4, Supplemental Table 2). All adverse reactions were short-livedand none required hospitalization. Severe or ADL-disrupting adverse reactions were associated with a longer interval between the second dose and the mRNA-1273 booster (OR,1.37/month increase; IQR, 1.09 -1.72; P50.001) and (OR, decadeincrease; IQR, 0.54 -0.92; P50.011). Gender, comorbidity, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, time interval between the rst and second dose, and pre- and postboost Bab titers werenot associated with any adverse reactions (SupplementalTable 3). DISCUSSION This real-world study in Indonesian health-care workers who received two-dose CoronaVac primary vaccination6 months prior found that humoral immunity diminishedsubstantially over time, as reported previously. 23-25As expected, this was more pronounced in those who were not previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 than in those who had hybrid immunity resulting from previous infection. The heter-ologous mRNA-1273 vaccine booster dose increased Baband Nab titers signi cantly in all tested individuals, including those who had undetectable antibody levels before thebooster. In adjusted multivariable analysis, Bab titers after receiving the mRNA-1273 booster were found to be greatest in individuals who had a history of a virus breakthrough after FIGURE 1.

This nding of a longer interval between vaccine doses being bene cial for antibody pro- duction builds on existing literature for doses 1 and 2 of Oxford/AstraZeneca and mRNA vaccines.33-35Our observa- tions con rm intense SARS-CoV-2 exposure among frontline health workers in Jakarta during the Delta wave in July2021. 36Ourndings concur with the notion that Delta break- through infections postvaccination are associated with sub- sequent more potent and durable immune responses than those seen in individuals who were infected only or received only two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.37 From an immunological perspective, we noted a lower pre-mRNA-1273 booster correlation between Bab and Nab titers in the vaccinated-infected group, wherein the most recent exposure to the spike protein was from natural infec- tion rather than vaccination. This nding is consistent with natural infection generating diverse anti-S Bab to non- neutralizing epitopes \u2014a notion consistent with a recent study38in which plasma from individuals who had been infected and subsequently received mRNA vaccination could better neutralize an engineered SARS-CoV-2 polymu- tant spike protein or diverse sarbecovirus spike proteins. Moreover, we surmise the observed low post-mRNA-1273booster Bab and Nab titer correlations could be attributed to antibody production ceiling effects, as reported previously 39 for the association between anti-S1 IgG titers and the inhi-bition of the binding between S1 and angiotensin converting enzyme after the second mRNA vaccine dose.The high-dose heterologous mRNA-1273 booster was generally well tolerated, with common reports of injectionsite pain and swelling; as well as muscle pain, fever/chills, and headache; and 7.9% experienced a short-lived impair- ment in performing ADLs. The mRNA-1273 booster was bet-ter tolerated with increasing age and for a shorter time period since the second CoronaVac dose. These ndings largely concur with Moderna 's phase II/III trial of the high- dose (100- mg) booster dose, which was generally safe and well tolerated, with only slightly more frequent adverse reac- tions compared with the 50- mg dose. 40 Our study ndings add to current evidence on the use of mRNA booster vaccines in three main ways. First, it establishedthat heterologous mRNA vaccine boosting with mRNA-1273(Moderna) after CoronaVac is immunogenic and well tolerated in virus-exposed population re flecting real-world condi- tions. 29This concurs with other recent trials in which heterolo- gous boosting with the other widely used mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (P zer-BioNTech) after CoronaVac demonstrated better immunogenicity Delta and Omicron variants. 8-11Heterolo- gous boosting has been shown to result in an enhanced quanti- tative pro le of antibody and T-cell responses, and expands the ability to recognize multiple regions of spike compared with a homologous booster.41,42Second, our study evaluated a 100-mg full dose of the mRNA-1273 booster rather than the authorized 50- mg booster dose. On December 12,, 2021, Mod- erna announced40preliminary data that a mRNA-1273 booster of 50mg increased Nabs 37-fold, and that of 100 mg increased Nabs 83-fold, compared with preboost levels, in person withoutprevious infection. Third, the ndings contribute to informing policy on flexible options in deploying COVID-19 vaccines in mix-and-match schedules, with particular relevance for FIGURE 2.

Pre-mRNA-1273 boost Bab titers correlated inversely with the time since the most recent documented spike antigen expo- sure.

As policymakers in several countries have started implementing third or periodic boosting to protect the most vulnerable populations, and mitigate health-care and economic impacts, real-world data will be critical to guide decisions regarding when, which populations, and whichboosters should be administered. There are some limitations to our study. First, we did not assess anti-N IgG, Nabs against Delta and Omicron variants of concern, or cellular immunity. Although accumulating evi- dence suggests that the anti-S IgG Bab and Nab responses correlate with protection against infection, 43,44it is important to recognize there is not yet an established or well-de ned correlate of long-term vaccine protection,45and protection against hospitalization and death is likely to involve Bab and T-cell responses, which is supported by global data showingdecreased risk of severe disease after Omicron infection compared with previous waves in well-vaccinated popula- tions. 46Second, we could not fully con rm all who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 because routine surveillance may have been incomplete, and the use of anti-N IgG as a proxy forprevious infection was not valid because of the initial immuniza- tion with a whole-virus inactivated vaccine. Third, the sample size and follow-up period were insuf cient to identify less common or late adverse events after booster vaccination, and the immunogenicity data were limited to immuneresponses through study day 28. Fourth, only immunological data were collected and therefore this investigation lacksinformation regarding the effectiveness of a heterologousmRNA-1273 booster vaccination, in particular against infec-tion with the emergent BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants, and future variants. Last, demographics of the volunteers were not rep- resentative of the Indonesian population, and elderly individu-als were not represented. In conclusion, our real-world data indicate that, after a pri- mary course of CoronaVac inactivated vaccine, aheterologous, booster was and was well toleratedamong heavily SARS-CoV-2 -exposed health-care workers, even in those with very low preboost antibody titers. Further trials on clinical end points of optimized booster dosesand variant-speci c or multivalent vaccines in response to decreased susceptibility to neutralization of emergingSARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are warranted. 47 Received April 13, 2022.
