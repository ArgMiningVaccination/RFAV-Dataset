These carefully planned reviews are \"bridges\" to Algebra 1. By design, only those bridges determined to be appropriate for the individual student are released within the student's course sequence, providing a personalized path. Each Algebra 1 unit includes two or three bridges of prerequisite concepts and skills. Each bridge strings together two levels of prerequisite content. The first level draws from concepts addressed in grades 7 and 8, and the second level digs even further back into foundational skills to draw from grades 7 and 6 content. Upon completion of a bridge, the associated new Algebra 1 concepts are presented.

A mathematical function is a machine that takes in a number as an input and produces another number as an output. There are many kinds of functions. Some have graphs that look like lines, while others have graphs that curve like a parabola. Functions can take other forms as well. Not every function has a graph that looks like a line or a parabola. Not every function has an equation. The important thing to remember is that if you put any valid input into a function, you will get a single result out of it.
