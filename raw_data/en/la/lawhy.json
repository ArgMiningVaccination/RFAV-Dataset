Sepi went through my background and the consultation has given me real confidence that I'm in good hands and I'm feeling so much better already.\" - Shay L. \"Been doing yoga regularly with Sepi and for the first time in my life finding yoga a relaxing and mindful experience (and also funny at times!). I also had with Sepi a very good holistic treatment and was truly impressed by how she diagnosed my situation without me saying a word. Highly recommended.\" Lisa S. I met Sepi at a yoga and cacao ceremony, following that I went for consultation where she helped me identify through an assessments any concerns I had and what may be causing them. I had issues with asthma and my skin and Sepi made a herbal tincture and a tea which was specific to my needs and within a few weeks my symptoms had reduced. Sepi is amazing at what she does and is the kindest soul you will meet and great fun too.. she doesn't overcomplicate the treatment either which I loved as I have been to other clinics and felt I had to change alot to get results but Sepi reassured me I don't. Couldn't recommend her enough Andy A. I came to Sepi's clinic in desperation having been diagnosed with cancer my health was deteriorating quick, suffering from depression due to the diagnoses, I had lost all faith in doctors and such, I started to research natural medicines which lead me to Sepi and honestly, she saved my life, after only a few months treatment im cancer free and I feel like a teenager again, full of life, I couldn't thank you enough Sepi, for for all your help.
