More than 2,000 years ago, the treatise, Yellow Emperor's Internal Classic, established the concept of \"treat before ill,\" commonly referred to as \"preventive medicine.\" This concept emphasizes the importance of disease prevention and early treatment, which are two universal strategies used in modern healthcare. \"Disease Prevention and Early Treatment\" \"Preventive Medicine\" advocates ongoing, proactive control of health and disease. This concept focuses on overall functional rehabilitation and highlights the importance of preventing the occurrence, worsening, and recurrence of disease. Thus, dietary supplementation, acupuncture, and herbal bathing can be used together to effectively maintain health, treat or reduce the risk of disease, and ultimately improve quality of life. The absence of symptoms does not necessary mean that the body is healthy. For example, abnormal protein accumulation and synaptic dysfunction can occur in the brain 20 years before a person is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Cogniherbs\u00ae follow the wisdom of the \"Preventive Medicine\" concept and aim to tackle the root cause of Alzheimer's disease before symptoms appear. How Chinese medicine defines brain degeneration According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, the emergence of \"forgetfulness\" follows the deterioration of brain functions and is closely related to the dysfunction between the brain and the heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys. Brain degeneration is caused by deficiencies in basic functions and insufficient waste clearance. Among them are deficiencies in qi and blood, five visceral deficiencies, a lack of kidney essence, and brain hypofunction. Meanwhile, insufficient waste clearance includes the accumulation of blood stasis and incapability of removing turbidity. Impairment of both physically and mentally related brain functions is the key cause of memory loss. In the clinical practice of Chinese medicine, such symptoms are primarily treated by targeting deficiencies in basic bodily functions. For example, the kidneys function to nourish the brain. Thus, reinforcing kidney function can reduce the risk of the aging-related memory loss. In addition, the theory of traditional Chinese medicine postulates that a proper daily diet can improve physical abilities and promote immunity. This is also an essential to the \"Preventive Medicine\" concept. Cogniherbs\u00ae are formulated to follow the theory of Chinese medicine and are made of ingredients considered \"top grade\" in Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing. Top-grade herbs: mainly for nourishment; considered \"precious\" Chinese herbal medicines but can also be used as dietary supplements; non-toxic or very low toxicity; can be taken long term; suitable for the elderly and individuals with chronic illness or physical weakness \"Suboptimal Health State\" In the 1950s, the World Health Organization expanded the definition of \"health\" to include physical, mental, and social adaptation in addition to the absence of disease or weakness. However, changes in living habits, especially urbanization, have caused more and more people to have poor health without any specific disease state according to standard medical diagnostic methods. This status, called Suboptimal Health Status (SHS), sub-health, or intermediate status, represents the \"third\" population of health besides the healthy population and the patient population. Approximately two out of three people have SHS. People with SHS almost always experience physical symptoms lasting for more than three months. These symptoms are often related to abnormal functioning of the nervous system, such as memory loss, dizziness, headache, insomnia, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and chronic pain (such as back pain), as well as abnormal functioning of the digestive, cardiovascular, or urinary system. \"Aged over 45 - Peak of Suboptimal Health State\" Current scientific research indicates that SHS is associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, including abnormalities in blood pressure and cortisol, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol indices in the blood. In addition, abnormalities in blood glucose and triglycerides are risk factors specific to men and women, respectively. The theory of traditional Chinese medicine already describes a state similar to SHS: a disorder that lies between a balanced \"healthy\" state and an imbalanced \"ill\" state and involves imbalance between yin and yang. The recommended methods to relieve this state include herbal dietary supplementation, acupuncture, massage, and qigong guidance to balance blood and qi as well as restore visceral "}
