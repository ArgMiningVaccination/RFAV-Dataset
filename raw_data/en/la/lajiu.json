Recent advances in 3D printing (3DP) and tissue engineering approaches enable the potential application of these technologies to vaccine research.

Here, this review summarizes two major ways that tissue engineering and 3DP strategies could contribute to vaccine research: (1) 3D human tissue models to study the response to virus can be served as a testbed for new potential therapeutics.
