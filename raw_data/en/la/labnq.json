Towards this end, we aimed to understand the therapeutic effectiveness of a polymer based vaccine ap proach at enhancing the anti-tumor responses in a tumor- bearing mouse model. While we and others have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of PLGA based systems in delivering antigen etc., studies scarcely focus on understanding the immunological mechanisms of polymer based therapies in tumor bearing treatment models. Considering tu mors modulate the immune system and consequently the efficacy of therapies, understa nding treatment mechanisms in the presence of tumor will help lead to more efficacious treatment options. We demonstrate here that a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) based delivery system encapsulat- ing tumor antigen (OVA) and the TLR9 agonist CpG motif DNA administered into the tumor microenvironment initi- ates an effective type 1 mediated (IFN- producing) anti-tumor response in a syngeneic murine model of T cell lym- phoma (E.G7-OVA). Although E.G7-OVA tumors spontaneously generate antigen specific CTLs in draining lymph nodes (LN), tumors progress rapidly. Modulation of the tumor microenvironment via local PLGA based therapy led to the generation of a systemic antigen specific Th1 response, absent in the non-polymer delivery method, subsequently associated with reduced tumor growth and prolongation of surv ival. These studies provide further insight into the use of a PLGA-based therapeutic approach at modulating the tumor microenvironment and highlight the need for analyzing the treatment effects in a tumor bearing model.

Introduction Studies from our and other laboratories clearly demon- strate that the tumor microenvironment represents a com- plex interface between the immune system and the tumor, leading to poor antigen presentation, elevated levels of IL-10 or increased Treg activ ity [1-5]. Identifying im- mune escape mechanisms and developing targeted strate- gies to overcome these mechanisms has thus been a focus of recent studies [6-8]. Fundamentally, work from our lab has focused on approaches to modulate the tumor microenvironment to enhance effective systemic immu- nity. The studies here demons trate that intratumoral im- munization using a polymer complex is effective at gene- rating a systemic immune response and enhancing sur- vival. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) ( P L G A ) i s a n F D A a p - proved resorbable polymer widely utilized as a delivery vehicle that offers numerous advantages over other de-livery methods of therapeutic agents. As we and others have shown, PLGA enhances antigen presentation, in- creases cross presentation, en sures co-delivery of antigen and adjuvant to antigen presenting cells, and protects from proteolytic degradation of the encapsulated moie-ties [9-13]. Studies presented in this report build on our prior demonstration that polymer encapsulating CpG motif oligonucleotides effec tively activates antigen-pre- senting dendritic cell populations in vitro [13]. In this prior work we have demonstrated enhanced expression of CD80, CD86, MHCII and secretion of IL-12 associated with the stimulation of Th1 T cell responses. *Corresponding authors. Cop SciRes.

Considering the perturbations introduced by the tumor microenvironment, understanding the responses to treatment regimens within tumor models will help guide the design and potential efficacy of these therapeutic options. In efforts to accomplish this and understand the im- munological responses to a polymer therapy in a tumor model, tumor associated an tigen ovalbumin (OVA) and the immune adjuvant CpG motif DNA were encapsulated in PLGA and administered intratumorally to E.G7-OVA bearing mice. We find that intratumoral treatment using the combined moieties stimulates the development of a tumor-specific interferon (IFN)- producing response associated with a reduction in tumor growth and prolon-gation of survival. In examining the anti-tumor CTL and IFN-producing cell responses, we show that despite a significant CTL response in the local lymph nodes of tumor bearing, non-treated mice, tumor progresses. We demonstrate that treatment w ith the PLGA based therapy results in the generation of a new Th1 response and re- sults in decreased tumor growth. Taken together these results provide further understanding of the polymer based delivery system and emphasize the significance of analyzing immunological responses in tumor bearing models. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Tumor Model The tumor cell line E.G7-OVA was obtained from ATCC and maintained in TCM media (RPMI 1640 based with 10% FBS, AA, 110 mg/L Na-Pyruvate, 50 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin) at 37 C and 5% CO 2. Cells were split two days prior to implantation to ensure consistent growth. E.G7-OVA cells were derived from the C57BL/6 (H-2 b) mouse lymphoma cell line transfected by electroporation with plasmid pAc-neo-OVA a complete copy of chicken ovalbumin (OVA) mRNA. E.G7-OVA cells constitutive- ly synthesize and secrete OVA [17]. 2.2. PLGA Based Delivery System Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) based vesicles were generated using the water/oil/water double emulsion method [13,18], with the following modification. In brief, 0.1g of PLGA (Sigma-Aldrich, MW 7 - 17 kDa, 50:50 ratio) was dissolved in 0.4 ml of chloroform (Sigma- Aldrich). 50 mg/ml of OVA (ovalbumin, of CpG DNA (ODN-1668, phosphoro- thiated TCCATGACGTTCCTGATGCT, IDT) were added to the PLGA mixture at 0.05 ml per 0.4 ml of chloroform/PLGA. A microtip sonicator (Branson Ultra-sonics) created the primary emulsion at 60% magnitude for 5 sec pulses and repeated for 4 cycles. This primary emulsion was combined with a 2 ml solution of 7% PVA (Sigma-Aldrich, MW 31 - 50 kDa, 87% hydro-lyzed) sonicated for another round. Secondary emul-sion was added drop-wise to an 8 ml bath of a 7% PVA solution under constant stirring overnight at 4 C. Final product was collected by centrifuging at 16,000 xg for 2 hours, washed with dH 2O, resuspended in 2% sucrose FITC labeled BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved to 50 mg/ml and Cy5 labeled CpG DNA (IDT) was dissolved to 5 mg/ml and incorporated into the polymer fabrication as before. Ly-ophilized polymer was weighed and lysed with 3 M NaOH. Supernatant was collect ed and scanned on a fluo- rescent plate reader at 495 nm and 655 nm, correspond- ing to the labeled BSA and CpG DNA respectively. Stan- dard curves were generated and loading concentrations calculated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on washed and dried PLGA vesicle samples. Samples were first sputter coated with gold for 2 min at 30 - 40 mA. Imaging was performed at the indicated magnifica-tions with a 20 kV electron beam. 2.3. Murine Model and Therapy Four to 6-week old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and main-tained in a HEPA-filtered cage system for at least 1 week before use. For the prophylaxis studies, mice were im-munized via subcutaneous (s.c.) injections into the lower left ventral abdomen with 5 mg of polymer in 100 \u00b5l of PBS, followed by another 5 mg injection of the same polymer after 2 weeks. Saline solution was used as a sham control. After an additional one week, mice were challenged with 250 \u00d7 10 3 EG7-OVA cells s.c. in the lower left ventral abdomen (day 0). For the treatment model, 250 \u00d7 10 3 E.G7-OVA cells were implanted s.c. into the lower left ventral abdomen. On days 3, 5, and 7, intratumor (i.t.) injections of 5mg of the respective poly-mer were administered. Mice were monitored and the tumor sizes were measured every 2 days with metric calipers by measuring the largest two diameters. Mice were sacrificed when the longest diameter of the tumor reached 1.5 cm. Kaplan Meier survival plots were gener-ated using MedCalc commercial software. Mice were Copyright \u00a9 2013 SciRes.

Stimulators were splenocytes derived from na\u00efve female C57BL/6 mice. Spleens were disassociated, in-cubated with ammonium chloride buffer (ACK, 0.15 M NH 4Cl, 1.0 mM KHCO 3, 0.1 mM EDTA) for 5 min to lyse red blood cells, washed with TCM then filtered through a 70 \u00b5m mesh (BD Falcon). Cells were resus-pended in toethanol (2-ME), at 4 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml and cultured with or without 300 \u00b5g/ml of OVA overnight. Effector cells were harvested and processed from the inguinal lymph nodes and spleens of day 16 treated mice. 3 \u00d7 10 6 stimu- lator splenocytes were then added to 7 \u00d7 106 effector cells in 2 ml total volume. On day 4, 50 \u00b5l of supernatant was harvested from each co ndition and analyzed for IFN- via a sandwich ELISA. On day 5, effector cells were harvested and added to target cells. 2 \u00d7 10 6 E.G7- OVA target cells were incubated with 100uCi of 51Cr for 1 hour at 37 C and 5% CO 2. 51Cr-labeled target cells (5 \u00d7 103) and effector cells were combined at known effec- tor:target (E:T) ratios in 200 \u00b5l of TCM media. After 4hrs in 37 C and 5% CO 2, 100 \u00b5l of supernatant was collected and measured for 51Cr with a gamma counter (Packard Bioscience). Percentage of specific lysis was calculated from the formula (experimental release-spon- taneous release) \u00d7 100/(maximal release in 1%SDS- IFN- Responses Elisa assays for elicited IFN- were performed as we have described [5]. Briefly, purified rat anti-mouse IFN- (PharMingen) was diluted in coating buffer (NaHCO 3) to 2 \u00b5g/ml and incubated overnight at 4 C on 96 well flat bottom plates (Nunc). Plates were blocked with PBS/ 10%FBS for 2 hours at room temperature. Standards and sample were added at 100 \u00b5l per well and incubated overnight at 4 C. After washing, biotin-conjugated anti- mouse IFN- (PharMingen) were dissolved to 1 \u00b5g/ml and added at room temperature for 45 min. Wells were washed and avidin-peroxidase diluted to 2.5 \u00b5g/ml in PBS/Tween/0.1%FBS for 30 minutes at room tempera-ture was added. Enzyme activity was determined using (OPD, Sig- (pH 4.5) with 3%H 2O2. Reaction was stopped with 3M HCl and color read at 492 nm. 2.6. Statistical Analysis Results were expressed as the experimental averages \u00b1 SE. Statistical comparison between experimental aver-ages was done using a two sample equal variance Stu-dent's t-test at the p < 0.05 level. 3. Results 3.1. Polymer Delivery System With the goal of developing a vaccine platform which would allow incorporation of both varied antigenic mate-rial and immune-regulating agents, we have adopted on the utilized to vesicles. SEM images ( Figure 1(a) ) visualize the polymer vesicles when fabricated as describe d, having an average diame- ter of 500 nm [13]. With a starting concentration of 50 mg/ml, final encapsulation of the tumor associated anti-gen OVA was measured to be 11 \u00b5g of OVA per mg of polymer vesicle and CpG DNA encapsulation with a starting concentration of 5 mg/ml yielded a final 150 pg of CpG DNA per mg of vesicle ( Figure 1(b) ). To verify the ability of the polymers to be phagocytosed by antigen presenting cells, we delivered PLGA particles containing rhodamine labeled dextran to bone marrow derived DCs in vitro as previously demonstrated [13] ( Figure 1(c) ). As seen in Figure 1(c) , these DCs readily take up the polymer vesicles. 3.2. Prophylactic Immunization Protects against Tumor Formation To demonstrate the capacity of the polymer complex to effectively generate tumor-s pecific immunity, C57BL/6 mice received 2 s.c. injections of the polymer complex 2 weeks apart and where challenged with tumor 7 days later. PLGA encapsulating both tumor antigen and CpG was used. Unmethylated CpG motif DNA is a TLR9 agonist that stimulates B cell and antigen presenting cell functions [19]. We added antigen to the CpG DNA based on our prior studies demonstr ating the efficacy of intra- tumoral immunization using antigen-encoding poxvirus to overcome tumor microenvi ronment associated immune escape and elicit a systemic response [8]. Combined CpG DNA and tumor antigen have previously been shown to stimulate IFN- responses manifesting antitumor acti- vity [20,21]. Mice were pretreated with the polymer vac- cine then challenged with tumor.

At the time when control mice needed to be sacrificed, day 17, all mice tr eated with antigen and ad- juvant had either no palpable tumors or below 10 mm2 tumor cross-sections while sham had most tumors above 100 mm2 cross-sections ( p < 0.01, Figure 2(b) ). We saw no statistically significant difference between mice treat- ed with PLGA-OVA or PLGA-OVA+ CpG DNA, as the anti-tumor response from either regimen was very effec- tive at delaying tumor onset (Figure 2 ). Vaccination prolonged survival of mice in each treatment condition compared to sham ( p < 0.02, Figure 2(c) ). Several tumor free mice as a result of vaccination were seen, demon- strated in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves ( Figure 2(c)). To determine the therapeutic effects of the PLGA-CpG+ antigen complex, tumor bearing mice were administered the PLGA based therapy intratumorally starting 3 days post tumor implantation (3 injections 2 days apart) and the anti-tumor responses measured. A significant delay in tumor growth was seen after administration of polymer treatment ( Figure 3(a) ). While empty PLGA vesicles had no effect on tumor grow th compared to saline treat- ment (not reported), we observed that all other polymer treatment conditions delayed tumor growth in compari- PLGA-Polymer Encapsulating Tumor An tigen and CpG DNA Administered into the Tumor Microenvironment Elicits a Systemic Antigen-Specific IFN- Response and Enhances Survival 284 Figure 2.

Although no significant difference between PLGA-OVA and PLGA-CpG DNA treatment was observed, PLGA with both OVA and CpG DNA demonstrated an optimal delay in tumor growth ( p < 0.02, Figure 3(a) ). By day 17, all PLGA-OVA+CpG DNA treated mice had tumors below 50 mm 2, while all other polymer conditions had numerous if not most tumors above 50 mm 2 (p < 0.05, Figure 3(b) ).

It is of note that the soluble delivery of OVA and CpG had similar effects on tumor growth as with the polymer delivery. However, the immunological responses differed as the PLGA based system provided enhanced IFN- production while soluble delivery did not. 3.4. E.G7-OVA Spontaneously Elicits Local but Not Systemic CTL Response Cytotoxic T cell activity is oft hypothesized as the pri- mary mechanism underlying antitumor responses [8,12, 14,22]. To assess the putative role of CTL in anti-tumor activity and the response of CTL to therapy in our system, Copyright \u00a9 2013 SciRes. JCT PLGA-Polymer Encapsulating Tumor An tigen and CpG DNA Administered into the Tumor Microenvironment Elicits a Systemic Antigen-Specific IFN- Response and Enhances Survival 286 both local (LN) and systemic (splenic) tumor-specific CTL activity was evaluated in tumor bearing mice. Fig- ure 4 shows a representative result of one of three such experiments where 51Cr release assays were used to demonstrate the systemic (splenic) and local (LN) anti- gen specific CTL response of tumor bearing mice fol- lowing therapy. We observed that tumor growth alone led to a significant local lymph node, but not systemic, CTL response reminiscent of what we observed in the MB49 system [8]. The poly mer treatments neither en- hanced the local (LN) CTL activity nor induced systemic CTL activity. Since polymer treatments were still able to retard tumor growth, these experiments suggest that CTL activity alone does not account for tumor regression and support the existence of dysfunctional or inadequate CTL in vivo activity. Despite significant CTL activity, tumors progressed in size as seen in Figure 3(a) . 3.5. Polymer Delivery System Elevates Th1 Response To determine the effects of polymer treatment on the generation of tumor-specific Th1 responses in tumor bearing mice, we examined the local (LN) and systemic (splenic) lymphocyte compartm ents for antigen-specific IFN- production. We found that saline (sham) treated mice expressed a low baseline level of IFN- in both the spleen and lymph nodes (Figure 5 ). Consistent with our previous findings where polymer delivery to dendritic cells increased expression of CD80, CD86, MHCII and production of IL-12 [13], mice treated with OVA and CpG DNA via PLGA polymer generated a significant tumor-specific IFN- (Th1) response both systemically and locally as compared to sham ( p < 0.05, Figure 5 ). Interestingly, we found that when mice were treated with OVA and CpG DNA in soluble form, there was no in-duction of a type 1 response, as no significant change in IFN- levels was observed ( Figure 5 ). 4. Discussion The studies presented here demonstrate the ability of a polymer delivery system to induce a Th1 producing tu-mor antigen specific anti-tumor immune response in a tumor bearing mouse model. Although CTLs, considered primary effectors at inducing tumor regression, were present in tumor draining lymph nodes, tumor growth was still robust in non-treated mice. We demonstrated that PLGA based delivery of antigen and adjuvant was able to overcome this immu ne deficiency and generate local (LN) and systemic (splenic) IFN- mediated re- sponses, slowing tumor growth. However, although both soluble and polymer delivery methods were efficient at reducing tumor growth, the cumulative data warrants fur- ther investigations into the mechanistic understanding of polymer based delivery systems in tumor bearing models. Studies from our and other laboratories have demon- strated the necessity of analyzing therapeutic strategies in the context of tumor models by highlighting a variety of overlapping mechanisms contributing to tumor-immune escape. It has been well docume nted that tumors can curb the immune response by producing and/or inducing fac-tors such as IL-10 [5,23,24], [27]. Our prior studies in the murine bladder cancer model MB49 showed that tumor- associated IL-10 can render antigen presenting cells defi- cient and inhibit immune stimulation [5]. Consistent with Figure 4. Representative sy stemic and local CTL responses against E.G7-O VA cells. OVA-restimulated spleens and lymph nodes from respective conditions were cultured with 51Cr labeled target cells, E.G7-OVA, at the indicated Effector:Target (E:T) ratios. Systemic (spleen) specific lysis was below detectio n after OVA restimulation. CTL re sponse was elevated in the tumor draining lymph nodes, however no difference is seen between the different treatment conditions.

Data repre- sents the average of n = 3 5 independent experiments run in triplicate. our findings here, we found in the MB49 model that local but not systemic CTLs were generated by the tumors [8]. This lack of systemic immunity could be overcome by immunizing into the tumor microenvironment but not systemically using a recombinant viral vaccine producing antigen and GMCSF. Using the E.G7-OVA model here we found a similar tumor-specific CTL population lo-cally but not systemically, also deficient at retarding tu-mor progression. While the delivery of antigen and ad-juvant is well known and documented to induce key im-mune responses, such as in the current model to retard tumor growth, understanding the mechanisms involved with these responses in a tumor bearing model provide significant insight into therapeutic strategies. To thus broaden the therapeutic immunization techniques and more importantly understand their behavior and effects on tumor bearing models, we utilized a PLGA based polymeric delivery system to administer antigen and ad- juvant to tumor bearing mice. PLGA is FDA approved, easily adaptable to different systems and cost effective. It has high bio-compatibility with minimal toxicity; the original monomers, lactic acid and glycolic acid, are byproducts of various metabolic pathways [28]. In addition, these vesicles are phagocyto-sed in vivo by macrophages and antigen presenting the deve lopment of adaptive immu- nity [18]. We have recently shown that PLGA based vac-cines provide a platform to increase the activation of dendritic cells [13]. We demonstrated that delivery of antigen and adjuvant via PL GA vesicles significantly enhanced the activated phen otype of antigen presenting cells in vitro . Cell surface expression of CD80, CD86, MHCII and secretion of IL-12 were upregulated as a re-sult of treatment. Concurrently, we and others have seen that PLGA provides a more efficient method for den-dritic cell stimulation as compared to soluble delivery; greater immunological responses are seen via PLGA de-livery as compared to equivalent amounts delivered in solution [13,29-31]. Despite this growing evidence advocating polymer Copyright \u00a9 2013 SciRes. JCT PLGA-Polymer Encapsulating Tumor An tigen and CpG DNA Administered into the Tumor Microenvironment Elicits a Systemic Antigen-Specific IFN- Response and Enhances Survival 288 based immune therapies, studies analyzing the effects of PLGA on tumor bearing models are often limited to tu- mor growth analysis with little emphasis on immunologic mechanism or are limited to immunization, not treatment, regimens [14-16,22,32]. Given that tumors modulate the immune system, as highlighted previously, understanding the in vivo effects of these polymers in tumor models is critical in designing more effective therapeutic protocols. For example, studies have demonstrated that in vivo im- munizations of naive mice with PLGA encapsulating OVA and CpG stimulate antigen specific CTLs [22]. As demonstrated in our study however, despite significant tumor specific CTL activity in the tumor microenviron- ment from non-treated mice, th ey are insufficient at pre- venting tumor growth. This observation may arguably negate the requisite for therap ies that are designed with a focus on exclusively enhancing CTL activity. To there- fore demonstrate and unders tand the efficacy of this polymer system in inducing an antigen specific anti-tu- mor immune response, the polymer was adopted for use in the E.G7-OVA tumor bearing mouse model. While intratumoral injections of the PLGA vesicles failed to stimulate systemic CTL activity, the PLGA complex significantly stimulated a local (LN) and sys- temic (splenic) antigen specific IFN- mediated Th1 re- sponse. The soluble delivery of the same components failed to generate a significant antigen-specific IFN- producing response both locally and systemically. These results further demonstrate both the advantage of a polymer based delivery system and the difference in re- sponse that is generated. Studies from other non-tumor bearing models support these findings and show efficacy for a PLGA based antigen deliv ery system at enhancing humoral immunity, inducing el evated antibody levels and generating Th1 responses to specific antigens [33-37]. In particular, elevated IFN- is commonly attributed to a strong CD4+ mediate Th1 response [38], and has been shown to act directly on tumor cells to inhibit both pro- liferation and angiogenesis and to facilitate apoptosis [39-41]. The current data is thus in support of the hypo- thesis that local PLGA delivery to a tumor bearing host generates a strong IFN- mediated Th1 response that may support combating tumor growth. It is of interest to note that delivery of OVA and CpG in both soluble form or PLGA vesicles induced similar tumor regression, while their respective Th1 responses differed. OVA is a known and well characterized foreign antigen, utilized for its high immunogenicity. It is there- fore not uncommon to find that different routes of im- munization will induce similar anti-tumor effects against a strong antigen. Determining the anti-tumor mechanisms created by each delivery meth od require further experi- mentation, but the processing of the antigen and adjuvant and the impact on antigen pr esenting cells is known to vary when delivered via polymer vesicles or other deli- very methods [42,43]. This can be hypothesized to ex- plain the enhanced IFN- response as a result of PLGA delivery. With elevated IFN- being a hallmark of CD4+ mediate anti-tumor activity, increasing a Th1 response may be critical for mounting successful anti-tumor re- sponses in models where the antigen is not foreign or immunogenic. Taken together, these results further de- monstrate the need to verify immunological analysis of in vitro and non-tumor bearing models in tumor systems. This sets an impetus for understanding mechanistically how polymer delivery systems modulate the immune response in this and other tumor models. In conclusion, the results demonstrate the importance of analyzing the immune response of proposed therapies in tumor bearing models. While the PLGA based deliv- ery system provides an effective means to deliver antigen and adjuvant into the tumor microenvironment and sti- mulate a CTL response, a CTL response alone is insuffi- cient at reducing tumor growth. As shown, tumor cells are able to elicit local antigen specific CTL responses in mice without vaccination or stim ulation, but are insuffi- cient at perturbing tumor gr owth. The data suggest tumor cells fail to prime for a functional type 1 (IFN- ) re- sponse in normal mice. Treatment with PLGA provides a means of escaping immune tolerance, and although addi- tional experimentation would be required to verify, the data suggests a role for a tumor-specific IFN- mediated response. With a broader understanding of the immune responses in tumor bearing hosts and the specific thera- peutic targets which serve to modulate those responses, we ca n better assess and subsequently design improved therapeutic vaccine delivery strategies. 5.
