Despite being widely discredited, research suggests that journalists report this controversy by presenting claims both for and against a link in a relatively 'balanced' fashion. To investigate how this reporting style influences judgments of vaccine risk, we randomly assigned 320 undergraduate participants to read a news article presenting either claims both for/against an autism-vaccine link, link claims only, no-link claims only or non-health-related information. Participants who read the balanced article were less certain that vaccines are safe, more likely to believe experts were less certain that vaccines are safe and less likely to have their future children vaccinated. Results suggest that balancing conflicting views of the autism-vaccine controversy may lead readers to erroneously infer the state of expert knowledge regarding vaccine safety and negatively impact vaccine intentions. Science Communication 2013 Media coverage of contentious risk issues often features competing claims about whether a risk exists and what scientific evidence shows, and journalists often cover these issues by presenting both sides. However, for topics defined by scientific agreement, balanced coverage erroneously heightens uncertainty about scientific information and the issue itself. In this article, we extend research on combating so-called information and issue uncertainty using weight of evidence, drawing on the discredited autism-vaccine link as a case study. We examine whether people's perceptions of issue uncertainty (about whether a link exists) change before and after they encounter a news message with weight-of-evidence information. We also explore whether message exposure is associated with broader issue judgments, specifically vaccine attitudes. Participants (n = 181) read news articles that included or omitted weight-of-evidence content stating that scientific studies have found no link and that scientists agree that none exists. Postexposure issue uncertainty decreased\u2014in other words, issue certainty increased\u2014from preexposure levels across all conditions. Moreover, weight-of-evidence messages were associated with positive vaccine attitudes indirectly via reduced information uncertainty (i.e., one's belief that scientific opinion and evidence concerning a potential link is unclear) as well as issue uncertainty. We discuss implications for risk communication. While the movement from research to practice in medicine and health policy is well studied in the philosophy of medicine, an underresearched component of this knowledge-to-action trajectory has been the influence of media reporting on newsworthy health research. Media analysis has characteristically been a focus of communications and not philosophical research. However the epistemic and rhetorical impact of science and health reporting warrants attention by philosophers as another facet of the complex science-values relationship in healthcare. Science journalism (of which health makes up roughly 50% of its content (Hargreaves 2012)) shapes public understanding and engagement, which in turn influences patient choice as well as organizational and policy decisions. All the while, science reporting is frequently criticized for sensationalizing new findings and omitting the uncertainty of novel research, thereby misleading the publics into thinking that new scientific ideas are fully established (see, for example, Abola and Prasad 2016). In this chapter, we highlight many of these issues in our presentation of an original case study of media uptake of scientific research addressing a politically charged issue: vaccine hesitancy. Social Science & Medicine 2008 Journal of Communication 2015 Although balance is a well-known and arguably important journalistic norm, how should journalists adhere to this norm when the bulk of scientific evidence clearly favors one (presumably accurate) perspective? Should balance be defined in terms of the quantity of information or the quality of viewpoints presented? Using British and American newspaper coverage of the autism-vaccine controversy as a case study, this article explores whether balanced reporting on scientific claims produced a discourse at odds with the scientific consensus that there was no autism-vaccine link. Implications for journalism ethics and risk communication are discussed. Research on social media and research on correcting misinformation are both growing areas in communication, but for the most part they have not found common ground. This study seeks to bridge these two areas, considering the role that social media may play in correcting misinformation. To do so, we test a new function of Facebook, which provides related links when people click on a link within Facebook. We show users a post containing misinformation, and then manipulate the related stories to either confirm, correct, or both confirm and correct the misinformation. Findings suggest that when related stories correct a post that includes misinformation, misperceptions are significantly reduced. Health education research 2014 Romania has the highest cervical cancer burden in Europe. Despite the implementation of two human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programmes, the uptake remained extremely low and the programmes were discontinued. Given that media are a common source of information for the public and may influence vaccination decisions, this article sought to explore the content and quality of HPV vaccine media coverage in Romania. We conducted a content analysis of 271 media reports (from newspapers, magazines, videos and informational websites) published online between November 2007 and January 2012. Overall, results indicated that 31.4% of the materials were neutral, 28% were negative or extremely negative, 17% were mixed, while 23.6% were positive towards the vaccine. The most dominant vaccine-related concerns were side effects and insufficient testing. Elementary information about the vaccine and HPV was constantly left out and sometimes inaccuracies were found. Negatively disposed reports wer... 2008 We are in the post-truth era. At the end of 2016 post-truth has been chosen as \"new word of the year\". The concept of post-truth is a challenge for semiotics, since in traditional semiotics of text we may not speak at all about \"truth\", at least not intending it as a direct correspondence with some reality outside the text (Violi, Lorusso, 2004). In other words, any interpretation process presupposes one enunciator and one enunciatee and it is the latter that must take the decision to trust or not its addressor. Everything that comes outside this relation it is irrelevant. So, if we follow the definition provided by Oxford Dictionary, \"post-truth\" is quite difficult to analyse with traditional semiotic tools, because it is very difficult to define what should be considered \"objective\". Given that post-truth is a tricky case for semiotics, how can we deal with it, what should be a good analytical approach? The majority of texts concerning post-truth is produced online; on the web circulate both hoaxes and debunking articles, interacting and shaping meaning day by day and the web it is too big for a traditional semiotic approach. For this reason in this work we will try to include computational tools in a traditional analysis, integrating semiotic theory with a framework called Paragraph Vector (Le & Mikolov 2014). In my work, first of all we will focus on methodological issues of this combination: my corpus will be split in two parts, the first one will be analyzed with traditional semiotic tools. Then, We will formulate a hypothesis based on analysis' results and test this hypothesis with Paragraph Vector. At the end of this experiment We will extract some texts from Paragraph Vector's corpus to verify if my hypothesis has been confirmed or not. The aim of the experiment is to underline limits of both methods in a concrete case-study like post-truth analysis and in the end to verify if such a hybrid approach could be more successful than a traditional one.
