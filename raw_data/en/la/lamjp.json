This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. 1 NAME OF THE MEDICIN AL PRODUCT COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna dispersion for injection COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) 2 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION This is a multidose vial which contains 10 doses of 0.5 mL . One dose (0.5 mL) contains 100 micrograms of messenger RNA (mRNA) (embedded in SM-102 lipid nanoparticles). Single -stranded, 5' -capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates , encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV -2. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3 PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Dispersion for injection White to off white dispersion (pH: 7.0 - 8.0). 4 CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna is indicated for active immuni sation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2 in individuals 18 years of age and older . The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations . 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Individuals 18 years of age and older COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna is administered as a course of 2 doses (0.5 mL each) . It is recommended to administer the second dose 28 days after the first dose (see section s 4.4 and 5.1). There are no data available on the interchangeability of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna with other COVID -19 vaccines to complete the vaccination course . Individuals who have received the first dose of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna should receive the second dose of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna to complete the vaccination course . 2 Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not yet been established. No data are available. Elderly population No dosage adjustment is required in elderly individuals 65 years of age. Method of administration The vaccine should be administered intramuscular ly. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 . 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded . Hypersensitivity and anaphyla xis Anaphylaxis ha s been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following administration of the vaccine . Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. The second dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, generalised urticaria) t o the first dose of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna. Myocarditis and pericarditis There have been very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination with COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna , often in younger men and shortly after the second dose of the vaccine. These are typically mild cases and individuals tend to recov er within a short time following standard treatment and rest. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinated individuals should also seek immediate medical attention should they experience new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or arrhythmias. Anxiety -related reactions Anxiety -related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress related reactions may occur in association with vaccinatio n as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 3 Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individual s suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia ) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individua ls. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna may be lower in immunosuppress ed individuals. Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness Individuals may not be fully protected until 14 days after their second dose . As with all vaccines, vaccination with COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna may not protect all vaccine recipients. Excipients with known effect Sodium This vaccine c ontains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say, essentially 'sodium -free' . 4.5 Interaction wit h other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, p regnancy and lactation Pregnancy There is limited experience with use of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (s ee section 5.3). Administration of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. Breast -feeding It is unknown whether COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna is excreted in human milk. Fertility 4 Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, s ome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The safety of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 randomi sed, placebo -controlled, observer -blind clinical trial conducted in the United States involving 30,351 participants 18 years of age and older who received at least one dose of CO VID-19 Vaccine Moderna (n=15,185) or placebo (n=15,166) (NCT04470427). At the time of vaccination, the mean age of the population was 52 years (range 18 -95); 22,831 (75.2%) of participants were 18 to 64 years of age and 7,520 (24.8%) of participants were 6 5 years of age and older. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were pain at the injection site (92%), and redness (10%) . Adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity event s was associated with greater age. Overall, there was a higher incidence of some adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence of axillary swelling/tenderness , fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting and fever was h igher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above. Local and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1 . If required, symptomatic treatment with analgesic and/or anti -pyretic medici nal products (e.g. paracetamol -containing products) may be used. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The safety profile presented below is based on data generated in a placebo -controlled clinical study on 30,351 adults 18 years of age . Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency convention : Very common (1/10) Common (1/100 to <1/10) Uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100) Rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000) Very rare (<1/10,000) Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 5 Within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Onset in the vaccine group participants was 22 days, 28 days, and 32 days after Dose 2. ***There were two serious adverse events of facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers. The onset of swelling was reported 1 and 2 days, respectively, after vaccination The reactogenicity and safety profile in 343 subjects receiving COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna, that were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was comparable to that in subjects seronegative for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline. Reporting of suspected adverse reacti ons Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. If you are concerned about an adverse event, it should be reported on a Yellow Card. Reporting forms and information can be found at https://coronavirus -yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/ or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store and include the v accine brand and batch/Lot number if available. Alternatively, adverse events of concern in association with COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna can be reported to Moderna on the toll -free number: 08000857562 or via www.modernacovid19global.com . Please do not report the same adverse event(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between Moderna and MHRA (in an anonymised form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary duplicates. 6 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended . 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, other viral vaccines , ATC code: J07BX03 of action COVID -19 encapsulated in lipid the full -length SARS -CoV -2 spike protein modified with 2 proline substitutions within the heptad repeat 1 domain (S -2P) to stabilise the spike protein into a p refusion conformation. After intramuscular injection, cells at the injection site and the draining lymph nodes take up the lipid nanoparticle, effectively delivering the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into viral protein. The delivered mRNA does n ot enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is non -replicating, and is expressed transiently mainly by dendritic cells and subcapsular sinus macrophages. The expressed membrane -bound spike protein of SARS -CoV -2 is then recogni sed by immune c ells as a foreign antigen . This elicits both T -cell and B -cell responses to generate neutralising antibodies, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. Clinical efficacy The randomi sed, placebo -controlled, observer -blind Phase 3 clinical study (NCT04470427) excluded individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 6 months , as well as participants who were pregnant, or with a known history of SARS - CoV -2 infection . Participants with stable HIV disease were not excluded. Influenza vaccines could be administered 14 days before or 14 days after any dose of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna . Participants were also required to observe a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins prior to the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna . A total of 30,35 1 subjects were followed for a median of 92 days (range: 1-122) for the development of COVID -19 disease . The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per Protocol Set or PPS), included 28,207 subjects who received either COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna (n=14,134 ) or placebo (n=14,073 ) and had a negative baseline SARS -CoV -2 status. The PPS study popul ation included 47.4% 52.6% male, Asian, and 6.2% other . 19.7% of participants identified as Hispanic or Latino . The median age of subjects was 53 years (range 18 -94). A dosing window of -7 to +14 days for administration of the second dose (scheduled at day 29) was allowed for inclusion in the PPS. 98% of vaccine recipients received the second dose 25 days to 35 days after dose 1 (corresponding to -3 to +7 days around the interval of 28 days). COVID -19 cases were confirmed by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT PCR) and by a Clinical Adjudication Committee. Vaccine efficacy overall and by key age groups are presented in Table 2. Table 2: Vaccine Efficacy Analysis: confirmed COVID -19# regardless of severity starting 14 days after the 2nd dose - Per-Protocol Set 7 Age Group (Years) COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna Placebo % Vaccine Efficacy (95% CI)* Subjects N COVID -19 Cases n Incidence Rate of COVID -19 per 1,000 Person -Years Subjects N COVID -19 Cases n Incidence Rate of COVID -19 per 1,000 Person -Years Overall #COVID -19: symptomatic COVID -19 requiring positive RT -PCR result and at least 2 systemic symptoms or 1 respiratory symptom. Cases starting 14 days after the 2nd dose. *Vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence interval ( CI) from the stratified Cox proportional hazard model ** CI not adjusted for multiplicity. Multiplicity adjusted statistical analyses were carried out in an interim analysis based on less COVID -19 cases, not reported here. Among all subjects in the PPS, no cases of severe COVID -19 were reported in the vaccine group compared with 30 of 185 (16%) cases reported in th e placebo group . Of the 30 participants with severe disease, 9 were hospitalised, 2 of which were admitted to an intensive care unit. The majority of the remaining severe cases fulfilled only the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease ( 93% on room air). The vaccine efficacy of COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna to prevent COVID -19, regardless of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection (determined by baseli ne serology and nasopharyngeal swab sample testing) from 14 days after Dose 2 was 93.6% (95% confidence interval 88.5, 96.4%). Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID -19. The level of protection gained after dose 1 was assessed in a post -hoc analysis in the mITT Set. In the interval 14 days after dose 1 to dose 2, there were 35 cases of COVID -19 on placebo and only 2 in the vaccine group. This indicates that the vaccine may provide some level of protection from 14 days after the first dose and before receiving do se 2. For optimal protection, two doses should be administered one month apart. Elderly population COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna was assessed in individuals 18 years of age and older, including 3,768 subjects 65 years of age and older. The efficacy of COVI D-19 Vaccine Moderna was consistent between elderly (65 years) and younger adult subjects (18 -64 years). Paediatric population The licensing authority has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). Conditional approval This medicinal product has been authorised under a so -called 'conditional approval' scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. New information on this 8 medicinal product will be reviewed at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable . 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. The full relevance of animal studies to human risk with vaccines for COVID -19 remains to be established . General toxicity General toxicity studies were conducted in rats (intramuscularly receiving up to 4 doses exceeding the human dose once every 2 weeks). Transient and reversible injection site oedema and erythema and transient and reversible changes in laboratory tests (including increases in eosinophils, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen) were observed. Results suggests the toxicity potential to humans is low. Genotoxicity/ carcinogenicity In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were conducted with the novel lipid component SM - 102 of the vaccine. Results suggests the genotoxicity potential to humans is very low. Carcinogenicity studies were not performed. Reproductive toxicity In a developmental toxicity study, 0.2 mL of a vac cine formulation containing the same quantity of mRNA (100 micrograms) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of COVID - 19 Vaccine Moderna was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 28 and 14 days prior to m ating, and on gestation days 1 and 13. SARS -CoV -2 antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on lactation day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine -related adverse effects on fe male fertility, pregnancy, embryo foetal or offspring development or postnatal development. No data are available of mRNA -1273 vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 List of excipients This vaccine contains polyethylene glycol/macrogol (PEG) as part trihydrate Sucrose Water for injection s 6.2 Incompatibilities This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products or diluted. 9 6.3 Shelf life Unopened vial: 7 months at -25\u00baC to -15\u00baC.
