Driving a commercial motor vehicle requires careful planning and consideration. These additional factors are highly dependent on cognitive and visual skills for accuracy. This study aims to identify specific clinical tests that correlate well with commercial driver's license (CDL) driving performance. We developed a two-hour driving fitness assessment battery consisting of tests that have been shown in the literature to be reliable and valid measures of driving-related cognitive and visual skills in drivers, with appropriate scoring systems and recommendation guidelines. Data will be collected annually for three consecutive years, year 1 data has already been collected. The goals of this year of the study were to: 1) Assess the cognitive and visual fitness of CDL drivers by implementing the battery of tests listed above for years 2 and 3, 2) Confidentially share the results with each CDL driver , 3) Share potential risk factors that contribute to unsafe driving with the CDL driver and provide resources to improve any recognized deficits, 4) present our findings in a paper or scholarly presentation. Over the course of the grant, we anticipate the study will identify the top five clinical tests that can correlate well with on-the-road driving safety of CDL drivers.||No| |Melisa Boersma||Radiation Oncology||\"Prevalence of Executive Control (ECF) Impairment Among Patients Referred for Radiotherapy.\"||Administered the MMS and EXIT25 assessments of mental status and Executive control functioning to patients receiving radiation therapy at the UTHSCSA Radiation Oncology Department prior to receiving radiation and again at a later predetermined date.

We want to understand how the decrease in clinical exposure and experiential learning impacts students as they determine their specialty choice. The primary aim of our study is to describe how the decreased experiential learning that the medical student class of 2022 experienced during their third year of medical school impacted their decision to choose a medical special-ty. Additional aims will describe how the decreased experiential learning impacted: 1. student confidence in their decision to choose a specialty 2. student confidence in their readiness to enter residency 3. student perception of the value of experiential learning during medical school This is a mixed methods study combining quantitative survey data with qualitative focus group data. We will uti-lize survey data assessing students' confidence in choosing a specialty previously collected by the Office of Medi-cal Education at the University of Kansas Medical School in the students' first year for the class of 2022. We will distribute a questionnaire during the focus group asking for descriptors of participants to include current specialty interest, confidence of specialty choice, and gender. We will conduct focus groups with students from the class of 2022 to explore qualitatively student experiences with reflections about the clerkship clinical experience and how that affected their specialty choice and confidence in specialty selection. While we anticipate student's ability to choose a specialty will not be impacted, our study results will clarify stu-dents' perceptions of the importance of clinical experiences in the clerkship and choosing a specialty. Our results will also provide guidance on which experiences in a clerkship are the most salient in assisting students' decisions about choosing a specialty. This knowledge will guide medical educators as they build clinical experiences into medical student curriculum. The summer medical student will be in charge of transcribing, verbatim, the 4-5 focus groups. Each focus group is 1.5 hours long.

Early screening of sleep disorders might facilitate accurate diagnosis and support timely therapeutic approaches. Physician-documented clinical notes capture underlying sleep symptoms that might not be available as structured fields in the electronic health record (EHR). In this study, we aim to leverage machine learning and natural language processing methods to validate algorithms to identify sleep disorders from clinical notes and other sources in the EHR. We will validate our algorithms by chart review identifying mentions/indication of sleep disorders. This would be a great opportunity for medical students to 1) understand the importance of sleep as it relates to other medical conditions; 2) fundamentals of artificial intelligence, machine learning and medical informatics; and 3) be involved in a rigorous study that could impact the field of sleep medicine.||Yes| |Jennifer McRae||General & Hospital Medicine||Depression screening and remission in clinic||How are we capturing the clinical management after completing depression screening.
