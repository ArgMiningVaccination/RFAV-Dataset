Welcome to our online booking site Acupuncture [Read More](1-description) Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the oldest medical practices on record. The ancient Chinese developed this unique medical system through careful and diligent study of the body, mind, emotions and the natural world around them. This methodology is based on the idea that pathways of energy, or 'qi', run in systematized patterns throughout the body. These pathways or 'meridians' circulate energy and nourish the tissues. Obstructions in the movement of this energy can result in a variety of potential imbalances and, if untreated, eventually pathology and disease. Acupuncture can help with a variety of conditions including, but not limited to, musculoskeletal pain, stress/anxiety, migraines, digestive issues, immune system, fertility and more. In addition to the practice of acupuncture, a practitioner may also include massage, cupping, moxibustion (heat therapy with the herb Artemesia), infrared heat, herbal formulas, nutrition and lifestyle recommendations in their treatments.
