Drell, MD When I came out of my office to meet Edgar for his monthly med check, I thought for a moment that he wasn't there. I then real-ized that Edgar was now a full-fledged adolescent complete with a scraggly beard, and not the scrawny miserable child I began seeing years ago. It is often difficult to get our original perceptions of patients out of our minds. My percep-tion of Edgar was of a small child that seemed to always have a dark cloud over his head. He never smiled, and when asked how things were, always said \"bad\" or \"lousy\" with an angry harangue about his selfish and stingy mother who was never there for him except to yell at him. His anger seemed the only thing that kept him from being completely depleted. He claimed to \"never, ever\" get what he wanted! Throughout the years, he was accom- panied to the sessions by his exhausted but resilient maternal grandmother who usually would bring him in to see me after her night-shift as a housekeeper at a local downtown building. She would chuckle tolerantly as Edgar complained and tried to cheer him up. He was hav-ing none of it! Edgar originally came to see me for ADHD. He responded well to the stimulants I prescribed, but said they did \"nothing\" and tasted bad. His grandma disagreed, even though she had ongoing concerns that the appetite suppression stifled his weight gain. Although I did extensive psychoeducation about the appetite suppression of the stimulants, and told her that I had never had a patient die of starvation from them, she never gave him his meds on weekends and I suspect also during many week days. The school felt that the stimulants helped his attention, but was not upset if he had his meds or not, as he didn't usu-ally \"act up\" or cause troubles. I wondered for the longest time with Edgar whether he might be helped by an antidepressant. He refused my sugges-tion for several years and then relented to my gentle persistence. Edgar insisted that, like the stimulant, the antidepres-sants did nothing. From my standpoint, they worked to the point that he occasionally smiled. The cloud was still there, but not nearly as dark. When for the first time in years, I asked him how things were going, he responded, \"ok.\" I was so pleased that I scared him by my loud exclamation of the word \"Great!\" He was so puzzled by my response that I had to explain why I was so pleased. He looked at me like I was nuts! He answered \"ok\" during most sessions after that and spoke a bit more about all the things that bugged him, including his mom, assorted family members, and the many \"stupid\" people at school. At the start of the session, when I asked him how things were going, he uttered his usual \"ok.\" Grandma shook her head \"no\" and remarked that since our last session, he had become upset after an altercation with his mom. \"Tell me about what happened,\" I asked.Edgar answered angrily that his one- year-old cousin was crying and that he picked her up to soothe her, at which point his mother told him not to. He told his mother \"no.\" Then grandma also said to \"put the child down.\" He said that he continued to hold his ground and contin-ued to hold his cousin. \"Then mom and grandma charged me. I was pinned against the wall. I was like a cat who's being confronted.\" \"Tell me more?\" I asked Grandma and Edgar. Grandma responded that she felt that Edgar shouldn't soothe his cousin, as it would \"spoil\" her.\"I was just soothing her,\" said Edgar angrily. Grandma then changed subjects to the cousin, a-one-year-old sister, who she said was definitely \"spoiled and a bully.\" I realized that I had a dilemma on my hands. How was I to honor Edgar's response, which I thought to be really great, without dissing Grandma? I began by congratulating Edgar for being nice to his cousin. Grandma repeated her sense that such actions would spoil his cousin. \"I understand your concerns, but I don't think soothing a crying child her age will spoil her. He was sad,\" I responded. Edgar then surprised me by saying that spoiling was when you give some-one something they don't deserve or haven't earned. Grandma did not respond other than repeating that the one-year-old sister was indeed spoiled. She repeated that she was a bully! \"I'm not sure a one year old can be a true bully, but they certainly let you know what they want and you can affect their behaviors by how you respond to them. I'm not sure a one year old has it together enough to be a true bully!\" Edgar agreed with me and repeated with emphasis, \"I was just calming her down!\" I then told them that I'd like to tie some things together. \"Edgar, I think is very empathetic and sensitive to his cousin's feelings. He was once that age and upset that his mother was not there for him. He has talked about this, and Grandma, you agreed with what he said. He has talked about how angry he got with his mother and that she was always making him cry. I think that Edgar was lucky to have you there for him when his mom wasn't. Grandma nodded and smiled. I think that A Med Check: Don't Cry Over Spoiled Milk continued on page 272COLUMNS272 AACAP NEWShis past experiences led to his response to his cousin.\" \"I think that Edgar was not spoiled as much as angry and sad that his mom wasn't there for him in the ways he wanted. I think he's still angry and sad.\" Grandma then gave me new informa- tion. \"His mom's doing better now and tried to talk to Edgar after the blow-up. She's doing better now.\" Edgar agreed that his mom was indeed doing better and that she tried to talk to him. He insisted, however, that he didn't ever want to talk to her. \"Why don't you want to talk to her?\" I asked. \"I'm mad at her!\"I completed his sentence, \"For not being there for you in the past.\" \"Yes!\" he exclaimed.\"I could tell. Unfortunately, she wasn't able to be with you and talk to you back then, for reasons of her own that I'm not sure I know everything about. I do know that she was probably doing the best she could even if it wasn't enough for you. It made you angry that she didn't soothe you. Is she better now?\" Edgar and grandma nodded together that she was. \"Edgar, does it make sense to not talk to her now because she didn't talk to you then? I can see how you might not want to talk to her. That is up to you. I do wonder what you want to do with all that anger and sadness that has never been dealt with. You can't go back and have her talk to you, then, but you can deal with what happened in the past therapy. So when you're ready, let me know and we can talk.\" \"They dragged me to therapy when I was younger and it didn't work,\" he snarled. \"Did you hear what I said?\"\"What?\"\"I said that when you are ready to talk that you should let me know. I know that dragging you or ordering you to have therapy won't help.\" I then renewed his medications and asked Grandma to leave so we could talk alone for the first time. I repeated what I had just told him. \"Let me know if that time comes that you are ready for therapy. It may be five years from now. It's a bummer that so many people think that soothing boys will spoil them and turn them into wimps. I think that every-one needs soothing and that if people were soothed more, that they'd be a lot less angry and bored. I'll see you next time.\" We shook on it and he left. m Dr. Drell is past president of AACAP and head of the Division of Infant, Child, and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Louisiana State University Medical School in New Orleans, Louisiana.

They are not considered to be pathological. Health promotion for all youth encourages open exploration of all identity issues, including sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression according to recognized practice guidelines. 1,2 Research consistently demonstrates that gender diverse youth who are supported to live and/or explore the gender role that is consistent with their gender identity have better mental health outcomes than those who are not. 3,4,5 State-based legislation regarding the treatment of transgender youth that directly oppose the evidence-based care recognized by professional societies across multiple disciplines is a serious concern. Many reputable professional organizations, including the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Endocrine Society, which represent tens of thousands of professionals across the United States, recognize natural variations in gender identity and expression and have published clinical guidance that promotes nondiscriminatory, supportive interventions for gender diverse youth based on the current evidence base. These interventions may include, and are not limited to, social gender transition, hormone blocking agents, hormone treatment, and affirmative psychotherapeutic modalities. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) supports the use of current evidence- based clinical care with minors. AACAP strongly opposes any efforts - legal, legislative, and otherwise - to block access to these recognized interventions. Blocking access to timely care has been shown to increase youths' risk for suicidal ideation and other negative mental health outcomes. Consistent with AACAP's policy against conversion therapy, 2 AACAP recommends that youth and their families formulate an individualized treatment plan with their clinician that addresses the youth's unique mental health needs under the premise that all gender identities and expressions are not inherently pathological.

Reflecting back on when I would ask mentors around me: \"What is it like to be a child psychiatrist?\" I would often hear \"you must like being around children.\" This made me feel more con-fident in my decision, because working around kids was always a dream of mine, especially after having my own. The difficult question for me was how not to mix being a mother with being a child psychiatrist. I never wanted to be in a position where I was subconsciously diagnosing one of my children. It took me a good seven years with kids to figure out some tricks, yet I found these skills essential to managing switching hats from practitioner to mother. Lesson One: Don't bring your work home! As a parent, it's imperative to learn how to manage your time effectively in order to save as many hours of the day to spend with your family. Three years ago, when I was an intern, I used to write some of my notes from home in hopes that seeing my kids an hour earlier would make them happier, but evidently locking myself in a room to finish my work turned out to be torture for both of us. I still remember the chilling comment my five-year-old daughter made one day as I walked out of the room from work-ing on notes. \"Momma, I know you love your computer more than me.\" Those words are every mother's worst night-mare and sent chills down my spine. At that moment I realized just how crucial it is to leave my work at work. I made Alaa Elnajjar, MDa conscious effort from there on after to finish everything I needed to before heading home, of course (as a resident) work never truly end. It was difficult but after a year of trying, I noticed the dif-ference in both my work and kids' life. I learned that the quality of the time that I spent with my kids made us the happi-est because I was present physically and mentally in the moment, that alone was more than enough. Lesson Two: Take your time switching hats. After a long day of treating an eight year-old kid who is telling you \"I don't want to live anymore\", or a ten year-old kid being bullied at school, just because she looks like a boy when she lost her hair to chemotherapy, it is only human for that to put a damper on anybody's mood, you never \"get used to it\". It's very difficult for these moments not to have an effect on my mood as I step into my house with my children greeting me as I come in. During my second year of residency where I had the emergency room experience, and seeing just how precious life truly is, I learned to take half an hour before going home to clear my mind (whether with a walk or just lying down on the resident lounge). These moments were just magical! As much as it was painful at the beginning to tolerate the guilt of spending (a little) less time with my kids, it meant the world to them that mommy was enjoying play time with loud laughter and joy. Lesson Three: Don't analyze your kids! It is hard after learning about therapy and all of these theories not to practice them at home! This lesson, unlike the rest, didn't take as much practice after already learning and implementing to take a few minutes to decompress before coming home. Switching roles from practitioner to mother turned out to not be the trickiest part; Instead, other motherly questions came to mind: What am I going to do at home as a mother? What are we playing for our special time? What story we are going to read? What lessons of the day can we share together? These questions turned out to be the toughest. I didn't need the reminder that I am a mother and my role is to love my kids uncondi-tionally, I didn't see myself looking for symptoms or signs, and when it came to them complaining about something, I often found myself saying \"let's ask your doctor,\" and I always get the amusing response \"but mommy you are a doc- tor.\" I learned to trust my kid's doctor to the degree that I often don't mention that I am in the same profession myself! Although I knew I wanted to be a child psychiatrist before I had my own kids, afterward, more than ever, I became a firm believer in early intervention and prevention in mental illness. I believe that addressing mental health problems properly in children can lead to a more thriving adulthood. Knowing the lifetime impact early prevention creates, it gives us CAPs a great incentive in doing what we do. As much as being a parent and a psy- chiatrist was challenging for me, it is the most valuable experience I could have ever asked for. Everything from being certain about pursuing this career to knowing how the absence of parents can leave our kids vulnerable to mental illness helped me. I can now say I am confident enough that I will be able to be a great child psychiatrist because I know what is like to be a parent! It is amazing how children in any capacity can have such an impactful and lasting effect in our lives. m Dr. Elnajjar is a PGY4 Child Adolescent Psychiatry Fellow at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein School of Medicine.

NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2019 277 COMMITTEES/REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONScontinued on page 278PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY COMMITTEE Overlap Between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Substance Use Disorder There is concern and hesitation among mental health providers in deciding how best to treat patients with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a substance use disorder (SUD). This is particularly worri-some amid misinformed claims suggest-ing that treating ADHD increases the risk of SUD and that using stimulants to treat ADHD are associated with methamphet-amine use. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to describe the incidence of ADHD, provide evidence that untreated ADHD is a significant risk factor for developing a SUD, and describe the significant proportion of adults with a history of methamphetamine use who have a history of untreated ADHD. The Overlap Between ADHD and SUD ADHD is among the most common neurobehavioral disorders, occurring in 6-9% of children and 5% of adults in the United States. 1 There is consid- erable bidirectional overlap between ADHD and SUD. Children with ADHD are two to three times more likely to develop SUD compared to children without ADHD. 2 Furthermore, ADHD has been associated with earlier onset and more severe SUD. Conversely, high rates of ADHD have been found in adolescents and adults with SUD. The etiology of the observed high rates of co-occurrence between ADHD and SUD is likely multifactorial. Biologically, studies have demonstrated dopaminergic and striatal abnormalities which occur in both disorders. An imbalance between the inhibitory control network and motivation-reward processing network may increase risk for SUD among indi-viduals with ADHD. 3 Psychologically, some individuals with ADHD may be drawn to substances as a means of 'self-medicating' ADHD symptoms. Socially, SUD may occur as the result of common sequelae of untreated ADHD, includ-ing low academic performance and social dysfunction. Given the high rates of co-occurrence between these two disorders, it is important to screen for ADHD symptoms in SUD populations and also for the presence of substance use in patients with ADHD. Does Early Treatment of ADHD with Stimulant Medications Increase Risk of SUD? Treatment of ADHD in school-aged children and adolescents includes con - sideration of medications, particularly stimulants. While stimulant medications carry the potential for misuse, multiple large registry and survey studies have demonstrated that stimulant treatment of ADHD reduces the subsequent risk of SUD. A nationally representative multi-cohort study of more than 40,000 high school seniors found that initiating stimu - lant treatment of ADHD before the age of 10 and for six or more years reduced the likelihood of SUD in adolescence as compared to individuals with ADHD who were treated with a nonstimulant medication, initiated stimulant treatment later, or received stimulant treatment for a shorter period of time. Additionally, initiating stimulant treatment prior to nine years of age resulted in sub-stance use patterns that were similar to population controls. 4 A Swedish national registry study of over 550,000 individu-als, which included more than 9,000 adults with ADHD diagnosed prior to age 15, found no evidence that treating individuals with ADHD using stimu-lant medication increased the risk of substance use. 5 Another Swedish registry study, which included more than 38,000 adults with ADHD, found that longer duration of stimulant prescription was associated with lower rates of substance use. 6 Finally, a within-individual analysis using 2,993,887 healthcare claims in the United States found that patients with ADHD were less likely to experience substance-related events when they were receiving stimulants or atomox-etine as compared to when they were not on medication to treat ADHD. Male patients had 35% lower odds and female patients had 31% lower odds of such events. These odds remained lower two years after receiving treatment; male patients had 19% lower odds and female patients had 14% lower odds of sub-stance related events. 7 Is There a Connection Between ADHD and Methamphetamine Use Disorder? In contrast to these data, there has been conjecture in the lay media suggest-ing that given chemical similarities, methamphetamine use may be linked to stimulant treatment of ADHD. For that reason, it is important to put into context the current rates of adolescent methamphetamine and crystal meth-amphetamine use, which are among the lowest ever recorded. In 2018, Monitoring the Future found that annual Charles A. Whitmore, MD, MPH, Robyn P. Thom, MD, and Timothy E. Wilens, MD 278 AACAP NEWS COMMITTEES/REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONSprevalence of methamphetamine and crystal methamphetamine among high school students had fallen substantially over the past two decades. Annual reported use of crystal methamphet-amine among 12th graders was 0.6%, following a peak of 3.7% in 1981 and a recent all-time low of 0.3% in 2015. Annual reported use of methamphet-amine was also near historic lows with 0.4% of 8th graders, 0.4% of 10th grad-ers, and 0.5% of 12th graders reporting annual use of methamphetamine. This is down considerably since 1999 when these questions were first asked. At that time 3.2% of 8th graders, 4.6% of 10th graders, and 4.7% of 12th graders reporting annual use of the metham-phetamine. 8 Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that prescriptions for stimulant medications are associated with this rise. In a retrospective study of 48 subjects presenting with meth-amphetamine psychosis or overdose showed that none of these cases had a prescription for a stimulant medication in the two years prior to presentation. 9 Should Stimulants be Used to Treat ADHD if There is a Comorbid SUD? There are multiple clinical consider- ations when assessing adolescents and transitional age youth with ADHD and SUD. Concentration is influenced by multiple psychological, biological, and environmental factors, and it is crucial to rule out such conditions as the primary cause of inattention. Given the influ-ence of substances on attention, it is particularly important to assess patients' symptoms of ADHD amid periods when they are abstaining from substance use. Additionally, patients with ADHD and SUD are more likely to experience comorbid mood and anxiety disor-ders. 10 When the presence of ADHD is confirmed, symptoms of these comorbid conditions need to be thoroughly evalu-ated and considered when selecting optimal treatments for these patients. Risks of Stimulant Misuse Though stimulants are first-line treat-ments for ADHD, these medications carry significant risk of diversion and misuse. Nonstimulants while having a lower effect size for ADHD, also have low abuse potential and are therefore typically considered first line treatments for patients with ADHD and concur-rent SUD. Common nonstimulants considered are atomoxetine, bupro-pion, alpha-agonists, and tricyclic antidepressants. Additionally, consider psychotherapy with motivational interviewing and subsequent cognitive behavioral therapy primarily addressing the patient's SUD. 11 When starting a stimulant to treat ADHD among patients with SUD, it is important to thoroughly review with them and their guardians the various potential risks and benefits of this treatment. Among patients with a pre-existing SUD, the primary risk of prescribing stimulants to this patient group is possible misuse and diversion. Within a large sample of undergraduate students, over half of the students currently prescribed stimu-lants reported selling or giving away stimulants during their lifetime though reported doing so infrequently. 12 While there is growing evidence that stimulants in the setting of comorbid SUD effec-tively treat symptoms of ADHD, this specific patient population appears to require higher average doses of stimu-lants to adequately treat symptoms of ADHD. 13,14 When dosed in such a way, patients can experience improved atten-tion, longer periods of abstinence, better retention in treatment, and fewer posi-tive urine toxicology screens. Clinical Recommendations for Safe Prescribing of Stimulants Prescribing stimulants to treat patients with ADHD and SUD requires a number of ongoing clinical considerations. 15 Prescriptions should be provided to cover only the number of days between appointments, and it is important to proactively address and act upon early medication refill requests. Medications should be stored in a secure location and administered by a responsible guard - ian at home and nurse at school. When monitoring treatment compliance as well as for substance use, utilize toxicology tests that screen for presence of the prescribed stimulant as well as pertinent substances of abuse. Additionally, given the known risk of diversion, it is particu-larly important to review that diverting stimulants, schedule II substances, is a felony. When selecting which stimulant to use, consider utilizing formulations that have relatively lower abuse poten-tial. These include various extended release formulations, transdermal methylphenidate lisdexam-phetamine, an extended-release prodrug of dextroamphetamine. AACAP's Psychopharmacology Committee continues to incorporate these conversations and considerations into our conference calls and working agenda. We continue to support work-shops, symposia, and collaborations that disseminate important information and treatment considerations relevant to this issue. m References 1.

The HIPAA Privacy Rule (HIPAA) applies to Covered Entities (CEs), which include healthcare provid- ers who transmit any protected health information (PHI) in an electronic form. HIPAA permits CEs to employ a Business Associate (BA) to help carry out its health care activities and functions. Specifically, a BA is person/entity that is engaged to do work involving the use/disclosure of PHI on behalf of a CE. In a physician practice, BA activities often include: billing, claims processing, legal services, accounting services, e-pre-scribing, medical transcription services, etc. The CE's staff members are not considered BAs under HIPAA, they are considered part of the workforce. 1 When employing a BA, HIPAA requires the CE to obtain satisfactory assurances in writing that the BA will safeguard the PHI it creates or receives on behalf of the CE. These written assurances given by the BA to the CE are referred to as Business Associate Agreements (BAAs). HIPAA specifically identifies the elements needing to be included in the BAA. 2 Among other things, the BAA must: Des cribe the permitted uses/disclo- sure of PHI by the BA; Sta te that the BA will not use/further disclose the PHI for any purposes other than those specified in the BAA; Moira Wertheimer, Esq., RN, CPHRM, FASHRM, Vice President, Risk Management Group Require the BA to safeguard the PHI fr om unauthorized uses/disclosures; Req uire the BA to report to the CE any unauthorized use/disclosure of PHI including incidents that consti - tute breaches of unsecured protected health information; Req uire the BA to disclose PHI as specified in its contract to satisfy a CEs obligation with respect to individuals' requests for copies of their PHI; Req uire the BA to comply with the HIPAA requirements applicable to carrying out their contractual obliga-tion on behalf of the CE; Req uire the BA to make available to HHS its internal practices, books, and records relating to the use and disclosure of PHI received from, or created or received by the BA on behalf of, the CE for purposes of HHS determining the CEs compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule; Req uire the BA at termination of the contract, to return or destroy all PHI received from, or created or received by the BA on behalf of, the CE; Req uire the BA to ensure that any subcontractors it may employ on its behalf that will have access to PHI agree to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to the BA; Aut horize termination of the contract by the CE if the BA violates a material term of the contract. Note that contracts between BAs and their subcontractors are also subject to these same requirements. A sample BAA can be found at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services: http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/sample-business-associate-agreement-provisions/index.html. As always, it is prudent to consult with your attorney prior to entering into any contracts to ensure compliance with applicable federal/state laws. mReferences 1. 45 CFR 160.103 (Definition of Business Ass ociate) 2. 45 CF R 164.504(e) Moira Wertheimer, B.S.N., JD, Assistant Vice President, Healthcare Risk Management, AWAC Services Company, Member Company of Allied World, 1690 New Britain Avenue, Farmington, CT 06032 U.S.A.

Sandler, MD, MPH, DLFAACAP A little eight-year-old girl, a new patient, told me this past week at her first visit: \"I care, that's why I'm violent.\" When asked what she meant, she replied, while thrusting her fisted arm up and down toward the floor \"Someone says something to me that I don't like and I want to stab them in the back, to kill them.\" The \"recipe\" that brought her to this troubling point in her young life has many ingredients yet to be determined and measured: genetics, gestation, life experience and exposures, family, peers, school. Of those ingredients that are within reach, all but the first two will become the focus, the \"targets\" of her treatment with \"safety first\" as a primary goal. We will implement \"The Golden Rule 2.0\": In this home and in your school, no one gets hurt because someone feels bad. With parental support and action, we will help her to monitor her emotions and to choose from an agreed-upon list of appropriate ways to express herself when she is upset. We will learn what sets her off, help her to avoid those situations if pos-sible, or, if not, to think before she acts when triggered. We will assure she gets a good night's sleep, eats well, stays physically (not merely technologically) active, and that she gets involved regularly doing some-thing she loves doing with people who love and care about her.We will remind her to: \"Use your words\" when she begins to act up or act out. \"Tell me what you are feeling and what you need,\" we will ask of her. \"Don't just show me.\" We will rehearse what is expected of her when she is upset, and we will \"pay\" her during rehearsal. We will recognize and reward her when she makes the right choice and mete out a consequence that \"fits the crime,\" and is not \"cruel and unusual\" when she does not. She is very young. We have time. But what if we were not, sadly, given the time? With the violence of recent weeks, we have witnessed the behavior of those who also \"cared\" when they chose to act. Perhaps they arrived at the moment of their horror with a recipe similar to that of my young patient but with-out the help that might have turned things around. Without timely treatment, in all of medical care, complications set in that worsen the condition and hinder later treatment. With mental illness, those complications, often, simply put, are bad habits, i.e, behaviors\u2014often damaging\u2014that nevertheless, we rely on to ease our distress and provide momentary relief. We all, even the most secure, have a two-column list of remedies we use when we are not feeling the way we would like: the healthy habits that soothe and comfort, and those unhealthy habits that do the job, but at a price. In one perspective, all of mental illness reflects a core inability to regulate one's emotional response to day-to-day experi-ence, with a resulting inability to regulate one's behavior toward others, and ulti-mately one's self-care. Harming others and self-harm become, at times, habitual modes of managing unwanted feelings. From this perspective, we derive the adage: \"Misery loves company,\" or more specifically: \"Misery loves miserable company.\" We may act out so others will know how we feel, or, worse yet, feel what we feel. In this view, all behavior is performance art, and to paraphrase Mr. Shakespeare: \"All the world's a theater.\" We are both actors and audience, and if we want to understand, not excuse, the violence, to get beneath just the evil of it, what we feel after the horror is what the shooter\u2014or my violent little patient\u2014wanted to share: their anger, their helplessness, their loneliness, their sadness, their fear, their loss. It may be that they had sought comfort from others but were dismissed, ignored, belittled, or, at worst, abused. Perhaps they had, up until the end, kept it to themselves, but, either way, \"acting out\" became inevitable. We psychiatrists profess we cannot predict violence. \"Only violence predicts violence,\" we are taught. However, per-haps fear, loneliness, helplessness, and sadness may also predict violence, and we must recognize these feelings in our \"acting out\" children and teen patients and reach out to them and their families in time. While we're at it, since misery can affect us all, we must remember to use our words, and thoughts, not fists or worse, to resolve problems, and, in doing unto others, ensure that no one gets hurt. m Dr. Sandler is \"Triple\" boarded.

Although rates of adolescent pregnancy and childbearing in the United States have been consistently decreasing since 2009, they remain higher than in other industrialized nations. Pregnant and parenting adolescents are at higher risk for school drop-out, lower educational/vocational attainment, repeat pregnancies, violence, living in poverty, mental health issues, and needing government assistance. Children of adolescent mothers are at increased risk for experiencing abuse/neglect, being raised by a single parent, being in foster care, living in poverty, lower school achievement, eventual school drop-out, being incarcerated as adolescents, becoming pregnant as adolescents, and being unemployed as adults. Compared to Caucasian adolescents, there is a higher rate of birth among black and Hispanic adolescents. Lower education and income levels of an adolescent's family can contribute to higher adolescent birth rates. Female adolescents in foster care are at double the risk of becoming pregnant than adolescents not in foster care. A recent study also found lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth were more likely to become pregnant or impregnate someone. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recommends: Screening pregnant/parenting adolescents (alone and with guardians if available) for: 1. Phy sical, sexual, emotional abuse/domestic violence to assess for safety; 2. Men tal health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, trauma, and substance use; 3. Ava ilability of family and other social supports; and 4. Acc ess to physical and mental health care. Con tinued support of school-based health centers, where many of these pregnant and parenting teens are able to access care and contraception to prevent repeat pregnancy. Resources should include information on housing, health care, and social services as necessary. Sup port of home-visiting programs, embedded programs in medical homes, and community outreach programs, which can improve parental understanding and care of their children, encourage completion of secondary education and further educational advancement, engage adolescent parents in couples counseling, and help with vocational training. Inc reased services and outreach to black, Hispanic, lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth, as well as those in the child welfare system. # The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry promotes the healthy development of children, adolescents, and families through advocacy, education, and research. Child and adolescent psychiatrists are the leading physician authority on children's mental health.

Share Your Photo Talents With AACAP News NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2019 293 FOR YOUR INFORMATION No. 106; Updated October 2019 Marijuana and Teens Many teenagers try marijuana and some use it regularly. Teenage marijuana use is at its highest level in 30 years, and today's teens are more likely to use marijuana than tobacco. Many states allow recreational use of marijuana in adults ages 21 and over. Recreational marijuana use by children and teenagers is not legal in anywhere in the United States. Today's marijuana plants are grown differently than in the past and can contain two to three times more tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the ingredient that makes people high. The ingredient of the marijuana plant thought to have most medical benefits, cannabidiol (CBD), has not increased and remains at about 1%. There are many ways people can use marijuana. This can make it harder for parents to watch for use in their child. These include: Smo king the dried plant (buds and flowers) in a rolled cigarette (joint), pipe, or bong Smo king liquid or wax marijuana in an electronic cigarette, also known as vaping Eati ng \"edibles\" which are baked goods and candies containing marijuana products Dri nking beverages containing marijuana products Usi ng oils and tinctures that can be applied to the skin Other names used to describe marijuana include weed, pot, spliffs, or the name of the strain of the plant. There are also synthetic (man-made) marijuana-like drugs such as \"K2\" and \"Spice.\" These drugs are different from marijuana and are more dangerous. Additionally, the products being sold in dispensaries currently are not subject to Food and Drug Administration standards and are not purely isolated cannabinoids; they are therefore not reliable in their potency/concentration of CBD or THC, or the inclusion of other ingredients. Parents and Prevention Parents can help their children learn about the harmful effects of marijuana use. Talking to your children about marijuana at an early age can help them make better choices and may prevent them from developing a problem with marijuana use later. Begin talking with your child in an honest and open way when they are in late elementary and early middle school. Youth are less likely to try marijuana if they can ask parents for help and know exactly how their parents feel about drug use. Tips on discussing marijuana with your child: Ask w hat they have heard about using marijuana. Listen carefully, pay attention, and try not to interrupt. Avoid making negative or angry comments. Off er your child facts about the risks and consequences of smoking marijuana. Ask y our child to give examples of the effects of marijuana. This will help you make sure that your child understands what you talked about. If yo u choose to talk to your child about your own experiences with drugs, be honest about why you used and the pressures that contributed to your use. Be careful not to minimize the dangers of marijuana or other drugs, and be open about any negative experiences you may have had. Given how much stronger marijuana is today, its effect on your child would likely be much different than what you experienced. Expl ain that research tells us that the brain continues to mature into the 20s. While it is developing, there is greater risk of harm from marijuana use. Sometimes parents may suspect that their child is already using marijuana. The following are common signs of marijuana use: Act ing very silly and out of character for no reason Usi ng new words and phrases like \"sparking up,\" \"420,\" \"dabbing,\" and \"shatter\" Hav ing increased irritability Los ing interest in and motivation to do usual activities. Spe nding time with peers that use marijuana continued on page 294294 AACAP NEWS FOR YOUR INFORMATION Having trouble remembering things that just happened Car rying pipes, lighters, vape pens, or rolling papers Comi ng home with red eyes and/or urges to eat outside of usual mealtimes Ste aling money or having money that cannot be accounted for Effects of Marijuana Many teenagers believe that marijuana is safer than alcohol or other drugs. When talking about marijuana with your child, it is helpful to know the myths and the facts. For example, teenagers may say, \"it is harmless because it is natural,\" \"it is not addictive,\" or \"it does not affect my thinking or my grades.\" However, research shows that marijuana can cause serious problems with learning, feelings, and health.Short-term use of marijuana can lead to: Sch ool difficulties Pro blems with memory and concentration Inc reased aggression Car accidents Use o f other drugs or alcohol Risk y sexual behaviors Wors ening of underlying mental health conditions including mood changes and suicidal thinking Inc reased risk of psychosis Int erference with prescribed medication Regular use of marijuana can lead to significant problems including Cannabis Use Disorder. Signs that your child has developed Cannabis Use Disorder include using marijuana more often than intended, having cravings, or when using interferes with other activities. If someone with Cannabis Use Disorder stops using suddenly, they may suffer from withdrawal symptoms that, while not dangerous, can cause irritability, anxiety, and changes in mood, sleep, and appetite. Long-term use of marijuana can lead to: Can nabis Use Disorder The s ame breathing problems as smoking cigarettes (coughing, wheezing, trouble with physical activity, and lung cancer) Dec reased motivation or interest which can lead to decline in academic or occupational performance Low er intelligence Men tal health problems, such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, anger, irritability, moodiness, and risk of suicide Medical Marijuana Some teens justify use of marijuana because it is used for medical purposes. Marijuana use with a prescription for a medical reason is called \"medical marijuana.\" Laws for medical marijuana are rapidly changing and are different from state to state. In some states, children of any age can get medical marijuana if they have a \"qualifying medical condition.\" There is very limited research supporting use of medical marijuana in children or teens for most conditions. In most states that allow medical marijuana, the marijuana is not regulated and therefore is not checked for ingredients, purity, strength or safety. There is no evidence that medical marijuana is any safer than other marijuana. Cannabidiol (CBD) Many parents have questions about CBD and how it may be helpful for their child. There is ongoing research on the use of CBD-containing products for conditions such as epilepsy, PTSD, Tourette's disorder, pain, and other diagnoses. For now, the use of CBD is only FDA-approved in children for specific forms of epilepsy and in adults for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. At this time, there is not enough evidence to recommend CBD for other uses, in children and adolescents Facts for Families: Marijuana and Teens continued from page 293 NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2019 295 FOR YOUR INFORMATIONincluding the treatment of autism and other developmental disorders. The approved CBD requires a prescription. Many stores sell CBD products. However, there are no safety and quality requirements for non-prescription CBD. They may have harmful additives or interfere with prescription medication. If you are considering using CBD for your child, please discuss this with their physician prior to starting to prevent harmful effects. Conclusion Marijuana use in teens can lead to long-term consequences. Teens rarely think they will end up with problems related to marijuana use, so it is important to begin talking about the risks with your child early and continue this discussion over time. Talking with your child about marijuana can help delay the age of first use and help protect their brain. If your child is already using marijuana, try asking questions in an open and curious way as your teen will talk more freely if not feeling judged. If you have concerns about your child's drug use, talk with your child's pediatrician or a qualified mental health professional.

They may also feel sensitive to being left out. Learning how to regulate emotions is a normal part of growing up. For some teens these emotions can be more extreme and a sign of serious problems. If your teen is experiencing intense and frequent mood swings, impulsive behaviors, self-harm or difficulties in relationships, it could be due to a psychiatric condition called Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Common signs of BPD include: Pro blems managing thoughts and feelings such as: Fre quent dramatic mood swings Epi sodes of rage Fee ling \"empty\" or \"numb\" Fre quent changes in self image Suic idal thoughts Dan gerous and Impulsive behaviors such as: Self -harm (e.g. cutting or burning oneself) Sui cidal behaviors Unsa fe sexual encounters Ill egal drug use Pro blems in relationships such as: Poor boundaries Int ense and unstable relationships Fra ntic efforts to avoid rejection or abandonment Fee ling misunderstood The exact causes of BPD are not known. Genetics and life experiences can contribute to the development of BPD. Some people with BPD have experienced abuse or trauma. Research has demonstrated that the following psychotherapies are effective treatments for young people with BPD or traits of BPD: Dial ectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) which teaches skills to manage symptoms Men talization Based Treatment (MBT) which works on building trust and curiosity A comprehensive treatment plan also may include: Par ent and family treatment Pee r and family support groups online or in-person Cre ation of a Crisis Plan that decreases the need to go to the emergency room or psychiatric hospital Med ications to treat associated symptoms such as anxiety, depression and impulsivity BPD can be challenging for young people and their families. With appropriate assessment and effective treatment, studies show that BPD can get much better over time. If you think your teen has BPD, it is important to have a comprehensive assessment by a qualified mental health professional to determine if these thoughts and behaviors are due to typical teen development, BPD, or another psychiatric illness.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE CNS stimulants, including JORNAY PM, other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. CONTRAINDICATIONS Known hypersensitivity to methylphenidate or other components of JORNAY PM. Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with methylphenidate products. Concurrent treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), or use of an MAOI within the preceding 14 days because of the risk of hypertensive crisis. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Cardiovascular Reactions: Sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults treated with CNS stimulants at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, and other serious cardiac problems. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases: CNS stimulants may cause an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Monitor all patients for hypertension and tachycardia. Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychiatric disorder and may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients with bipolar disorder. In patients with no prior history of psychotic illness or mania, CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms. Priapism: Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate products in both pediatric and adult patients. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal. Immediate medical attention should be sought if signs or symptoms of prolonged penile erections or are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. Long-Term Suppression of Growth: CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Monitor height and weight at appropriate intervals in pediatric patients. ADVERSE REACTIONS Based on accumulated data from other methylphenidate products, the most common (5% and twice the rate of placebo) adverse reactions for pediatric patients and adults are: appetite decreased, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, weight decreased, anxiety, dizziness, irritability, affect lability, tachycardia, and blood pressure increased. Additional adverse reactions (5% and twice the rate of placebo) in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years treated with JORNAY PM: headache, psychomotor hyperactivity, and mood swings. PREGNANCY AND LACTATION CNS stimulant medications, such as JORNAY PM, can cause vasoconstriction and thereby decrease placental perfusion. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JORNAY PM and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JORNAY PM or from the underlying maternal condition. Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as agitation, insomnia, anorexia, and reduced weight gain.

Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. INDICATIONS AND USAGEJORNAY PM is indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients 6 years and older. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION JORNAY PM should be taken only in the evening. Adjust the timing of administration between 6:30 pm and 9:30 pm to optimize the tolerability and efficacy the next morning and throughout the day. The recommended starting dose for patients 6 years and above is 20 mg daily in the evening. Dosage may be increased weekly in increments of 20 mg per day up to a maximum daily dose of 100 mg.Capsules may be swallowed whole or opened and the entire contents sprinkled onto applesauce. Do not substitute for other methylphenidate products on a milligram-per-milligram basis. CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to methylphenidate or other components of JORNAY PM. Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with methylphenidate products. Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, or within 14 days following discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, because of the risk of hypertensive crisis. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potential for Abuse and Dependence CNS stimulants, including JORNAY PM, other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk for abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. Serious Cardiovascular Reactions Sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults treated with CNS stimulants at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious cardiac problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and other serious cardiac problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during treatment with JORNAY PM. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases CNS stimulants may cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase 2 to 4 mmHg) and heart rate (mean increase 3 to 6 bpm). Individuals may have larger increases. Monitor for hypertension and tachycardia. Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation of Pre-existing Psychosis CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a preexisting psychotic disorder. Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression). New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history. If such occur, consider discontinuing JORNAY PM. In a pooled analysis of studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared with 0 in placebo-treated patients. Priapism Prolonged, painful erections, sometimes requiring surgery, have been reported with methylphenidate in both pediatric patients and adults. Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after time on the drug, often after an increase in dose. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal (drug holidays or during discontinuation). Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent, painful erections should seek immediate medical attention. Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon CNS stimulants, including JORNAY PM, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.Long-term Suppression of Growth CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth in pediatric patients. Careful follow-up of weight and height in patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or placebo over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and placebo-treated patients over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth (on average, 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in children treated with CNS stimulants, including JORNAY PM. Patients not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need their treatment interrupted. ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Trials Experience with Other Methylphenidate Products in Children, Adolescents, and Adults with ADHD Commonly reported (2% of the methylphenidate group and at least twice the rate of the placebo group) adverse reactions from placebo-controlled trials of methylphenidate products include: appetite decreased, weight decreased, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, dry mouth, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, affect lability, agitation, irritability, dizziness, vertigo, tremor, blurred vision, blood pressure increased, heart rate increased, tachycardia, palpitations, hyperhidrosis, and pyrexia. Clinical Trials Experience with JORNAY PM in Pediatric Patients (6 to 12 years) with ADHD The safety of JORNAY PM was evaluated in 280 patients (6 to 12 years of age) who participated in two controlled clinical studies of patients with ADHD. Study 1, conducted in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age, was comprised of a 6-week open-label dose-optimization phase in which all patients received JORNAY PM (n=125; mean dose 50 mg), followed by a 1-week, double- blind controlled phase in which patients were randomized to continue JORNAY PM (n=65) or switch to placebo (n=54). During the open-label JORNAY PM treatment phase, adverse reactions reported in >5% of patients included: any insomnia (41%), decreased appetite (27%), affect lability (22%), headache (19%), upper respiratory tract infection (17%), upper abdominal pain (9%), nausea or vomiting (9%), increased diastolic blood pressure (8%), tachycardia (7%), and irritability (6%). Three patients discontinued treatment because of affect lability, panic attacks, and agitation and aggression. Because of the trial design (6-week open-label active treatment phase followed by a 1-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal), the adverse reaction rates described in the double-blind phase are lower than expected in clinical practice. No difference occurred in the incidence of adverse reactions between JORNAY PM and placebo during the 1-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase. Study 2 was a 3-week, placebo-controlled study of JORNAY PM (n=81; mean dose 52 mg) in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years. Most Common Adverse Reactions (incidence of 5% and at a rate at least twice placebo): any insomnia, decreased appetite, headache, vomiting, nausea, psychomotor hyperactivity, and affect lability or mood swings. One patient in the JORNAY PM group discontinued from the study due to mood swings. Table 1 provides the incidence of adverse reactions reported in Study 2 (incidence of 2% or more and at least twice placebo) among pediatric patients 6 to 12 years in a 3-week clinical trial.

Blood and Lymphatic as increased, count decreased, White blood cell count abnormal, Severe hepatic injury Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone convulsion, Dyskinesia, DRUG INTERACTIONS MAO Inhibitors Do not administer JORNAY PM concomitantly with MAOIs or within 14 days after discontinuing MAOI treatment. Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors and CNS stimulants can cause hypertensive crisis. Potential outcomes include death, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, ophthalmological complications, eclampsia, pulmonary edema, and renal failure. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies and postmarketing reports on methylphenidate use during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes. No teratogenic effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of methylphenidate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2 and 9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively. However, spina bifida was observed in rabbits at a dose 31 times the MRHD given to adolescents. A decrease in pup body weight was observed in a pre- and post-natal development study with oral administration of methylphenidate to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses 3.5 times the MRHD given to adolescents. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions CNS stimulant medications, such as JORNAY PM, can cause vasoconstriction and thereby decrease placental perfusion. No fetal and/or neonatal adverse reactions have been reported with the use of therapeutic doses of methylphenidate during pregnancy; however, premature delivery and low birth weight infants have been reported in amphetamine-dependent mothers. Data Human Data A limited number of pregnancies have been reported in published observational studies and postmarketing reports describing methylphenidate use during pregnancy. Due to the small number of methylphenidate-exposed pregnancies with known outcomes, these data cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. Animal Data In studies conducted in rats and rabbits, methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 75 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis.Teratogenic effects (increased incidence of fetal spina bifida) were observed in rabbits at the highest dose, which is approximately 31 times the MRHD of 100 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m 2 basis. The no effect level for embryo-fetal development in rabbits was 60 mg/kg/day (9 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m 2 basis). There was no evidence of specific teratogenic activity in rats, although increased incidences of fetal skeletal variations were seen at the highest dose level (6 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m2 basis, which is also maternally toxic. The no effect level for embryo-fetal development in rats was 25 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m 2 basis). Lactation Risk Summary Limited published literature, based on breast milk sampling from ve mothers, reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses of 0.16% to 0.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio between 1.1 and 2.7. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. However, long-term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from CNS stimulant exposure are unknown.The devlopmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JORNAY PM and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JORNAY PM or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as agitation, insomnia, anorexia, and reduced weight gain. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JORNAY PM in pediatric patients less than 6 years have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of JORNAY PM have been established in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years in two adequate and well-controlled clinical studies in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years, pharmacokinetic data in adults, and safety information from other methylphenidate-containing products. The long-term efficacy of methylphenidate in pediatric patients has not been established. Long-Term Suppression of Growth Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, including JORNAY PM. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Rats treated with methylphenidate early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation demonstrated a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity in adulthood. A deficit in acquisition of a specific learning task was observed in females only. The doses at which these findings were observed are at least 2.5 times the MRHD of 100 mg/day given to children on a mg/m 2 basis. In a study conducted in young rats, methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks, starting early in the postnatal period (postnatal Day 7) and continuing through sexual maturity (postnatal week 10). When these animals were tested as adults (postnatal weeks 13-14), decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in males and females previously treated with 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.5 times the MRHD of 100 mg/day given to children on a mg/m 2 basis), and a deficit in the acquisition of a specific learning task was seen in females exposed to the highest dose (5 times the MRHD of 100 mg/day given to children on a mg/m 2 basis). The no effect level for juvenile neurobehavioral development in rats was 5 mg/kg/day (0.25 times the MRHD of 100 mg/day given to children on a mg/m 2 basis). The clinical significance of the long-term behavioral effects observed in rats is unknown. Geriatric Use JORNAY PM has not been studied in patients older than 65 years of age. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance JORNAY PM contains methylphenidate, a Schedule II controlled substance. Abuse CNS stimulants, including JORNAY PM, other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse. Abuse is characterized by impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Signs and symptoms of CNS stimulant abuse include increased heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and/or sweating, dilated pupils, hyperactivity, restlessness, insomnia, decreased appetite, loss of coordination, tremors, flushed skin, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed. Abusers of CNS stimulants may chew, snort, inject, or use other unapproved routes of administration, which can result in overdose and death. To reduce the abuse of CNS stimulants including JORNAY PM, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, keep careful prescription records, educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal of CNS stimulants, monitor for signs of abuse while on therapy, and re-evaluate the need for JORNAY PM use. Dependence Tolerance Tolerance (a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug results in a reduction of the drug's desired and/or undesired effects over time) can occur during chronic therapy with CNS stimulants including JORNAY PM. Dependence Physical dependence (a state of adaptation manifested by a withdrawal syndrome produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, or administration of an antagonist) can occur in patients treated with CNS stimulants, including JORNAY PM. Withdrawal symptoms after abrupt cessation of appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation. OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms of acute methylphenidate overdose, resulting principally from overstimulation of the CNS and from excessive sympathomimetic effects, may include the following: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, anxiety, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, convulsions (may be followed by coma), euphoria, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, sweating, flushing, headache, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, palpitations, Management Overdose Consult with a Certied Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) for up-to-date guidance and advice on the management of overdosage with methylphenidate. Provide supportive care, including close medical supervision and monitoring. Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdosages. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Use supportive and symptomatic measures. \u00a9 2019 Ironshore Pharmaceuticals Inc. All rights reserved. IP000365 07/19Nonprofit Org.
