In the study, infant rhesus macaques received several pediatric vaccines containing thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, in a schedule similar to that given to infants in the 1990s. Other animals received just the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which does not contain thimerosal, or an expanded vaccine schedule similar to that recommended for U.S. infants today. Control animals received a saline injection. Regardless of vaccination status, all animals developed normal social behaviors; the administration of vaccines to rhesus macaques did not result in neuropathological abnormalities or aberrant behaviors such as those often observed in autism. autism-puzzle Cellular analysis of the cerebellum, amygdala and hippocampus - three brain regions known to be altered in autism - was similar in vaccinated and unvaccinated animals. \"This comprehensive study included many physiological measures and behavioral measures. Fundamentally the vaccines had no ill effects,\" said [Gene Sackett](http://depts.washington.edu/chdd/iddrc/res_aff/sackett.html), UW professor emeritus of psychology and director of the lab work at the Washington National Primate Research Center. \"To the extent that macaques mirror human physiology, I think this bears out what most people have known: These vaccines are safe.\" [Laura Hewitson](http://www.johnson-center.org/index.php/site/staff/laura_hewitson) of The Johnson Center for Child Health and Development, a principle investigator, said the study was designed to compare the safety of different vaccination schedules, including the schedule from the 1990s, when thimerosal was used as a preservative in multidose vaccine preparations. The research also involved the UW's Center on Human Development and Disability; the University of Texas Southwestern; and Texas A&M Health Science Center & Central Texas Veterans Health Care System.
