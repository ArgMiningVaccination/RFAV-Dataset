Acupuncture Detox We are in the middle of an addiction epidemic!! Not only are we seeing a huge increase in opioid addiction in the United States, but we are seeing an increase in all kinds of addictions. This list includes things like vaping, internet use, sex, gambling, and sugar to name a few. In 2020, 78,056 people died in the United States due to drug overdose. Sadly, the CDC is reporting a 28.5% increase bringing that number to 100,306 at the end of 2021. The British Medical Journal has even reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the US opioid crisis. This report indicated that we were on track to \"record an all-time peak of overdose deaths in 2020.\" Something has to change in order for these numbers to decrease. Love Light and Healing Center is registered with the State of Arizona as an ACU-detox facility, offering NADA acupuncture to help you on your journey to an addiction-free life. NADA is a drug-free approach that helps solve a wide range of problems including pain, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and withdrawal symptoms from opiates, alcohol, and other substances. *NADA acupuncture is not a stand-alone treatment for addiction. Results may vary. Please consult your primary care physician for additional support. Please note: We do NOT offer inpatient treatment.
