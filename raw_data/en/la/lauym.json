[Chinese]Medicines (CMs) had been used to treat and prevent [viral infection] [pneumonia] [diseases]for thousands of years and had accumulated a large number of clinical experiences and effective [prescriptions]. AIM OF THE STUDY This [research]aimed to systematically excavate the classical [prescriptions]of [Chinese] [Medicine](CM), which have been used prevent and (Wenbing, Wenyi, Shiyi or Yibing) for long [history]in [China], to obtain the potential [prescriptions]and ingredients to alternatively treat COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS:We developed high-frequency herbs and formulas from ancient [prescriptions]. Virtual [screening]for the effective components of high frequency CMs and compatibility [Chinese] [Medicine]was explored by a [molecular docking]approach. Furthermore, [network pharmacology] used to preliminarily uncover molecule mechanism. RESULTS:574 [prescriptions]were obtained from 96,606 classical [prescriptions]with the (Wenyi or Yibing)\" or \" [Epidemic] 40 kinds of CMs, 36 CMs-pairs, 6 triple-CMs-groups existed with high frequency among the 574 [prescriptions]. Additionally, the key targets of [SARS-COV-2], namely 3CL [hydrolase](Mpro) and [angiotensin-converting enzyme 2](ACE2), were used to dock the main ingredients from the 40 kinds by the LigandFitDock [method]. A total of 66 compounds components with higher frequency were docked with the COVID-19 targets, which were distributed in 26 kinds of CMs, among which Radix]) CMs-pairs could also interact with the targets involving in immune and [inflammation] [diseases]. CONCLUSIONS:These results we obtained probably provided potential candidate CMs formulas or active ingredients to overcome COVID-19. Prospectively, [animal experiment]and rigorous clinic studies are needed to confirm the potential preventive and treat effect of these CMs and compounds. Mots cl\u00e9s ... LILACS LIS "}
